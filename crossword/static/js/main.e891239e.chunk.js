Ebola is a completely different virus from Marburg, and the first Marburg outbreak was at a plant that used chimpanzee parts to test vaccines, not a nazi test lab.  Basically since chimp DNA is so similar vaccines work the same way which is why they use chimp parts.  The Nazis really had nothing at all to do with Ebola.  The first ever outbreak of Ebola was in 1976, many years after the Nazis fell out of power.  Not that it didn't suck for the Africans or anything.  Symptoms in the later phases include detachment of the intestinal lining from its place, hemmorhaging from any or all orifices, liquidation of some internal organs (not from stomach acid by the way) and the mind often slows down to stopping.

Mr.Kohl "pioneered" a method where the registers are at the front like a grocery store but since then this technique has ineffective because current management believes that having only one worker on the registers is sufficient. Because of their lack of insight this leads to a constant "barrage of backup to mens!", "backup to womans!", "There is no line at jewelry!",etc over the intercom.Most of the time even despite the lack of workers at the register the reason for the hold up at the register is because of the employees who participate in long drawn out conversations with customers about the great "deals" they have. The main reason  for the delays at the register, however; is due to the company\'s credit policy. Each Manager is bred and trained into credit "whores" where their main existence is to bully and pester customers into signing up for credit cards where they charge a fee of 20% if your late on your payment.[$100, you pay $120]. If the customer says no they don\'t want a credit card in the manual an employee supposed to say, "Are you sure you have an opportunity to save up to 12 times a year" and if that doesn\'t work in a desperation move an employee is then supposed to ask if they would like to sign up for an email account. Kohls prides itself in a yes we can! policy i.e. if you bring a shirt to the register and say its 20 bucks but on the register it says the actual price is 30 they are supposed to give it to you for 20. Actually because the people working at the registers believe they have some divine duty to not give anyone a deal add to the increased barrage of people on the intercom by calling for employees to see if that is the actual price. Continuing their credit whore policy it is common for a manager to go on the intercom and plea for customers to sign up for a credit card and describing the "benefits", these can last up to 3 minutes. Even though the sounds emitting over the intercom can sound like nails on a chalkboard some would argue that its a better then the atrocious music that plays such favorites as "All in this Together" - Ben Lee[One day on an 8 hour shift this song played a total of three times inducing nausea].Kohls attempts to justify their credit whoring by saying that it benefits everyone including employees because each employee receives a meager stock option after a year of employment and it will help increase that value;however, most employees don\'t even survive their 90 day training period let alone a year. An employee also only receives an increase of 50 cents to their paycheck for each credit card whored. The job pays bad especially in comparison to other similar retail establishments in the same class some even offer commission. Every Kohls is always understaffed[granted a lot of employees quit] this shortage leads to a lack of customer service and a pigpen of a store. To add salt to the wound every week their is a customer service report card and the common complaint is lack of available associates, The managers then manipulate this statistic by putting the blame on employees saying they are not wearing their name badge or they don\'t smile and say hi to each customer. Kohl\'s does however offer cheap merchandise albeit at the expense of its employees so it is a good place to find a deal.That being said as an employee the workplace at Kohl\'s left me with a pessimistic outlook on life and since my termination from the company i feel like a changed individual.Oftentimes work experience will help you become a better worker but Kohls has managed to put me in a worse position then before i started.

The sound took a larger heavier sound with bands like Aerosmith, Black Sabbath, Pentagram, AC/DC and such bands. But Black Sabbath was the most respected and possibly the darkest of the lot. This is considered the Classical Metal era between the mid sixties to the late seventies. From there on out, when the eighties rolled around, Speed metal became popular with the NWOBHM movement, and thrash metal evolved with such bands as Metallica, Exodus, Primus, Trauma, Megadeth, Testament et cetera. During the 80s a more underground movement of slow metal began to evolve called Doom Metal by such bands as Candlemass, Pentagram and the like. Also in the mid 80s a new form of metal evolved from thrash called Death Metal, and used screams, and heavy notes, and shortly after a new style formed yet again from death metal called grind metal or grindcore. The 90's rolled around, and Groove Metal began evolving with such bands as Pantera, and even Ozzy with his new guitarist took upon himself a slower style more groove/doom based rather than thrash. Then around the late 90s the groove and doom metal scene flourished and produced such bands as crowbar, down, and black label society. Also around the 90s a new form of Metal formed, New Metal. It comprised of such bands as Korn, Slipknot, System of a Down, Tool, Nine Inch Nails, Manson, Sevendust, and Godsmack. This style focuses on dissonance for heaviness and loud vocals, probably inspired by the death/noisecore of the late 80's movement.

This language took its script from the Greek language. The language was widely spoken by the Romans and neighboring tribes, and was used as an universal language in the European Middle ages for the educated class.  Romanian, Spanish, Portuguese, French and Italian are languages that come directly from Latin (A.K.A Romance Languages) Latin it is studied for etymology, a better understating of Latin languages and to be able to read roman manuscripts from ancient and medieval times. \u201cLatin people\u201d (Latinos) is an expression mistakenly used only referring to South American people, which should include Western Europeans who inherited the language and some Roman culture. Also means as an historical fact someone who was born and/or lived in ancient Latium in western central Italy. The language it is also used in special Roman Catholic Masses. The word originated before the 12th century from Latin \u201cLatinus\u201d which means of the people of Latium and/or a Roman; from Latium which was an ancient region of western central Italy. To finalize, there are some Latin phrases that are still used today."},blops:{originalWord:"Blops",cleanedWord:"blops",example:"Person 1: Hey man, wanna get on xbox live and play some blops?\n\nPerson 2: Sure man i love blops!",definition:"An abbreviation of the words Black Ops, referring to Call of Duty Black Ops."},mixer:{originalWord:"Mixer",cleanedWord:"mixer",example:"I went to our mixer with X last night, and it rocked.",definition:"A party where a fraternity and a sororty get together to drink and socialize.
