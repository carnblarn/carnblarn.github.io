            <p class="lead">One of the best signs of a good Reddit comment is if it has more karma than the parent comment.
                I wrote a script to find comments like that. The requirements were that the original comment has >50 karma, and the response
                had a significant amount more than that. Whether these are truly enjoyable to read on their own is still up in the air.
