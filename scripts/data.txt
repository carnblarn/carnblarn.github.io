Vivisections were performed on prisoners after infecting them with various diseases. Researchers performed invasive surgery on prisoners, removing organs to study the effects of disease on the human body. These were conducted while the patients were alive because it was feared that the decomposition process would affect the results. The infected and vivisected prisoners included men, women, children, and infants.\n\n&gt;Prisoners had limbs amputated in order to study blood loss. Those limbs that were removed were sometimes re-attached to the opposite sides of the body. Some prisoners' limbs were frozen and amputated, while others had limbs frozen, then thawed to study the effects of the resultant untreated gangrene and rotting.\n\n&gt;Prisoners were injected with inoculations of disease, disguised as vaccinations, to study their effects. To study the effects of untreated venereal diseases, male and female prisoners were deliberately infected with syphilis and gonorrhea, then studied. Prisoners also were repeatedly subject to rape by guards.\n\n&gt;In other tests, subjects were deprived of food and water to determine the length of time until death; placed into high-pressure chambers until death; experimented upon to determine the relationship between temperature, burns, and human survival; placed into centrifuges and spun until death; injected with animal blood; exposed to lethal doses of x-rays; subjected to various chemical weapons inside gas chambers; injected with sea water to determine if it could be a substitute for saline solution; and burned or buried alive.\n\n... **they must have found very interesting things about human durability and resistance, among others, because the physicians involved were systematically granted immunity by the USA in exchange for the data.**\n\n&gt;After discovering the research papers, MacArthur secretly granted immunity to the physicians of Unit 731, including their leader, in exchange for providing America, but not the other wartime allies, with their research on biological warfare and data from human experimentation.\n\nI've heard people say a lot of the findings made by Unit 731 were very valuable in treating diseases and understanding physical conditions like hypothermia better.

The government conceals this for two reasons;  First it doesn't want to admit to faulty radar and sonar systems, and it would undermine the war effort.  \n\n\nThe Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was pushed into the Senate after the first, very real attack.  While the second \"attack\" may have helped it, it was almost certainly going to pass irregardless as anti-communist sentiment was high and it was not a full war declaration.  \n\nTL;DR, the Gulf of Tonkin incidents are really overhyped by anti-war or conspiracy fans.  The \"false flag\" operation was not needed from a realistic point of view and the original very real attack was more than grood for the passing of the resolution.

Well for my boyfriend and I it really didn't turn into an issue for us. We waited for about a week afterwards which is crazy early, for us to have sex again. But for us sex has always been very intimate, very sensual, very much about looking each other in the eye and really experiencing each others bodies. So it was easy for me to have sex with him. It felt safe and normal. My experience might be different if I was single or had a shitty boyfriend though.\n\nThe \"how should I act?\" question. Honestly depends on your relationship with the survivor. But what I appreciate the most is people who didn't ask questions, the people who gave me their sincere support, and those people who honestly just treated me normally after I told them. Because as I said in another comment, being treated normally during a period of my life that feels so chaotic and anxiety ridden is like a mini vacation. It's a breath of fresh air and actually makes me feel normal for a little while.
