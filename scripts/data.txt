I truly don't mind answering, In my childhood I lived in an abusive situation. And I felt a complete loss of control for years. I was a perfectionist. Next thing I knew I'm looking in the mirror seeing someone overweight, even though the number qualified me as underweight. And I slipped into the addictive satisfaction of being able to control something physically tangible and see myself shrink. If my whole life was terrible, at least I had only eaten X amount of calories and lost X amount of things. It was a coping mechanism. It gave me a false sense of control over my life and perfection. But it never lasted...Even in the picture on the left, I still thought I was fat. However, yes, I thought I looked better that way. I wanted to be thinner. It was never enough.
