I have 5 kids and love playtime with them all.. I live for moments like this... Playing with your babies until you collapse feels like a privilege.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;"}, {"comment": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I worked with kids with cancer for a while at a volunteer job in Africa. I&amp;#39;ve noticed that they can be narrowed down to 2 groups. The very happy, strong kids with supportive parents and the very weak ones that mostly have very absent parents. Of course, it&amp;#39;s not as normal to be absent in richer countries, but it still seems to be quite the same globally. Parents that are not as supportive of what their child is going through leave their kid to suffer a lot more than the ones that are there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She looks like a happy one. Be proud of yourself, you must be a good mommy. Keep your head up, you&amp;#39;re doing a magnificent job even though it&amp;#39;s incredibly hard for you and the little one. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "postTitle": "My little girl's hair started falling out during chemo, so we both shaved our heads:)", "response": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can never let them see you crying. Having a three year old, I have felt like an absolute crazy person masking my depression and acting silly to simply get a smile out of her (on the really rough days). But I have seen parents who neglect the poor sick children here, and it does just break my heart. Every one of these kids need solid support for all the poison they have to put into their bodies, every prick, incision, everything... One family even left their child here in the hospital:(&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;"}, {"comment": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/VJKn8hR\"&gt;I&amp;#39;m still waiting for this phone to be introduced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "postTitle": "The Onion compares iPhone 6 and Samsung Galaxy S5", "response": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My phone&amp;#39;s battery just ran away in fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;"}, {"comment": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had actually been thinking about something like this in a recent day dream.

They just started sniping anyone that came into their field of view, civilians, police, anyone.

Heavy weapons, fortified positions - suicide bomb network-dead man switches ect.. You get the Beslan School Siege. Misunderstanding led to a full on shoot out and a hasty storming by Spetznas. 340 hostages died, mostly kids, rest were saved. Several dozen spec ops were killed in the shoot-out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I dont fancy the chances of your 8 dudes with no hostages.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;"}, {"comment": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He defaecated infrequently, roughly every 40 to 50 days.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t poo for a month.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "postTitle": "TIL a man went over a year without food.

Anytime journalism is tainted by censorship, it loses legitimacy. Can you imagine if book publishers or newspapers refused to publish any words that might be offensive to anyone? Might as well black censorbar the entire thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s silly for a newspaper, even a student one, to champion the banning of words - have they even studied history of any kind? You know, learning from past censorship mistakes and all...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their intentions might be good, but they seem to blinded by their white knightery.
