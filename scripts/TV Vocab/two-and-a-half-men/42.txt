persons sexuality  is a personal thing it has no relevance in the business world   but he is gay  oh yeah  you know its okay to call them queer again  good to know good to know  would it fair to assume that youve led him to believe that  you are of a similar persuasion  not deliberately i kind of sort of backed into it   excuse me  okay poor choice of words  when we first met i found myself falling into his what do you call it  futon  no no his manner of expressing himself  tone gestures like talking to a southerner  you start saying yall and grits and tobaccy   oh charlie  its harmless

nice to meet you  hi wow you were married  it was before id gotten a grip on my sexuality  but not before you got a grip on my cousin walt  well i can see why you gave marriage a shot  pamela you are a breathtakingly beautiful woman  why thank you charlie  why do all the cute ones have to be married or gay  back off sister i caught this fish   gonna tell me whats bothering you  lf you dont know no point discussing  fine  you ignored me the whole night  a party where i dont know anyone and you abandoned me  alan listen closely  it wasnt a real date  not the point i was stuck playing truth or dare  with your friend eric and nine producers from will  grace  while you had a wonderful time talking to his hot exwife   i was just being polite  oh please   i saw the way you were looking at her  what i cant look  not when youre supposed to be with me  how many appletinis did you drink tonight  never you mind about that so so what are you gonna do  out yourself as a straight man so you can sleep with your little pamela  no no that would mess everything up with eric  unless i convince him  that she temporarily flipped me back to the home team  oh if youre gonna go just go  alan eat something toast a waffle anything absorbent  dont blame this on the liquor  okay heres what i can do  she and i are going shopping tomorrow  ill tell her im bisexual and then make my move  so youre gonna cheat on me  no thats not cheating   how do you figure  because were not really gay  then how can you be bi  shut up  okay well good night   arent you gonna ask  no jake told me  oh this is a cute top  im more a bottom man myself  ill bet you are   too slutty  havent you heard  slutty is the new black  oh you  is there some special young vagina enthusiast youll be taking that off for  i wish can you keep a little secret  im keeping a big one right now  i havent been with a man in almost a year  oh no color me sympathetic  i dont miss dating thats lies and pretense i do miss the sex  really well what specifically do you miss and tell me slowly  the feel of a mans hot breath on the back of my neck  his rough hands pulling me to him and just taking me  of course i dont need to tell you  no but im so glad you did  isnt it funny that i can only be this honest with a gay man  yeah its a riot  straight men only want one thing and theyll tell any number of lies to get it   the dogs  straight women are so competitive  theyll use anything you say against you  the bitches  gay women only want one thing and theyll lie worse than straight men  strange because theyve already got it  oh you come here  oh thats the other thing about gay men youre so hilarious  yeah were like clowns who smell nice  you know these are pretty  its pretty sheer eric hated it when he could see my nipples that a gay thing  well i cant speak for the community but i myself am nutty for nipples  lets try it on  okeydokey artichokey  all right hold this  okay  what do you think with or without the bra  i

underwear  belting out the entire score of hello dolly  it was mame mom  in fact if anything his lifestyle has brought us even closer  we cook together we shop together  we go to all kinds of parties and charity events together  come to think of it i have entered us in an alzheimers walkathon this sunday  sunday isnt really good for me  but you will be there anyway  because we support each other
