how much did you see  just enough to make sleep impossible  okay thats great i am dying to talk about this  all we did was kiss but charlie what a kiss  it was like our souls were merging   that was saliva alan  no seriously  i mean frankie is incredible think about it  first she loses her husband then she has to fight to keep her daughter  and yet still she has such incredible spirit such joie de vivre  okay would you like to hear my take on this  is it positive and life affirming  good night alan  okay no tell me what you think  all right  ive known you all your life and if theres one thing ive noticed  you are a stone sucker for the damsel in distress   i am not  come on alan  every woman youve ever been involved with  has been damaged and needy  wait what about okay go on  you devote all your time and energy into fixing them up  instead of doing the humane thing  which is to have sex with them and run away  exactly how is that the humane thing  my way they have a good time you have a good time nobody suffers  your way you get married you take over their lives  they start to hate you and you end up moving in with me  you know what charlie i think youre jealous   of who  of me  for the first time in our lives a woman picked me  over you and you cant deal with it  i can deal with it i dont get it but i can deal with it  i feel sorry for you i feel sorry that your heart  has become so hard and small that youve lost the capacity  to connect with another human being on any level any more meaningful  than the inebriated exchange of bodily fluids  boy leave it to you to take a beautiful thing  like drunken sex and make it sound dirty  i dont know why i even bother talking to you   alan  what  i thought we had a pact to never go to bed mad  leave me alone  come on dont you want to spoon  i swear to god you are going to lose that hand   thats not my hand  mom   do you know where jake is  no honey im sorry   were playing hideandseek  i dont know where hes hiding

say exactly the right thing  i dont know  i suppose i try to be sensitive to the moment  and weigh my words so that theyre emotional  no not always  listen frankie i was thinking  we get along so well and our kids get along  and since neither one of us really has our own place  alan  absolutely not   but  no my life is such a mess  and ive got to straighten out a bunch of things  before i can even think about a relationship  yes youve got a lot of baggage but its nothing i cant get to the curb   what  it was something charlie said  i was hoping youd know what it meant  no alan  i talked to my brother in seattle today  and he and his wife are going to put me and joanie up for a while   youre leaving  tomorrow morning  cause you know i can enroll her in school there and get a job  and start putting my life back together again  yeah no that makes sense sure   im sorry  no youre doing the right thing   look on the bright side alan  what bright side  youre going to get laid tonight  oh boy i think im going to cry again  okay hon the cabs waiting say goodbye to jake   bye jake  bye  oh man   charlie what can i say  i know im a great guy  oh man  you know i wouldve been happy to drive you
