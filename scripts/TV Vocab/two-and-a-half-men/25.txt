because i told him  he couldnt be part of the group  why not  you just saw him didnt you trust me he doesnt get any better  i mean he actually thinks this is a support group  this is a support group charlie  youre the only one whos pretending its about scotch and cigars  whatever kind of group it is we have rules about new guys joining  well but hes your brother  hes obviously going through a rough time  seems like you should be more supportive pal  hey i support him plenty  i share my home with him i share my food with him  i moved my foosball table so he could park in my garage  what more do you people want from me  let me tell you something about sharing kid  sharing is a twoway street  when you share with another human being  you always get back more than you gave  assuming that youre smart enough to share with somebody  thats got more stuff than you had in the beginning  hey dick its alan hows it going buddy  oh good good  listen you maybe wanna catch a movie tonight  oh

know as long as were talking about getting older  i was at this club the other night windowshopping  i realize im the oldest guy in the bar  i mean i still look good  but im competing for women with guys who are way younger  i gotta tell you i felt kind of depressed like maybe my best days are behind me  oh youre breaking my heart  theres maybe 11 women in this city who havent saluted his old flag  we should talk about charlie and his brother  what why  weve been meeting all these years and i never even knew you had a brother  i didnt see that it was relevant  let me tell you something about relevant  the root of the word relevant is rel  which is also the root of the word relative  your brother is your relative ergo your brother is relevant  what  another rel word is relapse  but ill wait my turn  hi is this doug ziskin  yeah yeah hey doug its alan harper  im your chiropractor but im calling as a friend  well id like to think we are  forget it sorry i woke you  hey neighbor

claims hes not in love with me  what do you want rose  nothing i was just sitting over there in charlies car  and thought you might like some company  from the minute they brought him from the hospital  everything was about the baby  dont wake the baby dont tease the baby dont paint the baby  then when he starts growing up it gets worse  everything he does i get blamed for  he wakes up one morning with no hair and one eyebrow its my fault  they find him tied to a street lamp  and big surprise everybodys looking at me  charlie you need to stop resenting your brother just for being born  hey i dont resent him for being born  but he abused the privilege  even now with you guys  i jumped through hoops to get into this group  i had to be recommended then i had to get to know you guys  now alan thinks he can waltz right in because hes my little brother  its not fair  let me tell you something about fair  what  charlie you know in your heart the right thing to do  fine you want him so bad ill get him  you know sean never speaks about his siblings  all right back off mary poppins  youre working on my last nerve  believe me alan i understand how hurtful it is to be rejected by charlie  and i found that the only way to get through it is to just love him more  that and every so often sneak into his bedroom and try on his underwear  helpful tip  hello   oh hello charlie  yeah listen ive been thinking  why dont you take a beano and come back to the house and join the group  oh really what changed your mind  i had a small stroke what difference does it make get your ass back here  well did it occur to you that i might be already otherwise engaged   no  well i am  it would be inconvenient for me to return right now  why where are you  where am i well thats none of your business  are you in the garage  oh please what on earth would i be doing in the garage  cut it out rose  youre being silly alan charlie is reaching out to you  yeah right last time he reached out  i wound up tied to a street lamp on wilshire boulevard  all right are you gonna come back inside  or do i have to drag you in by your big flappy monkey ears  listen to him alan hes begging  no thank you charlie i am quite happy chatting out here with rose  okay i tried to be the loving brother you sulky little weasel  that really wasnt necessary alan  yes it was youre my friend  and friends dont just abandon friends because something better comes along  then this might sting a bit  i have something else to do and im pretty sure its better  all right i asked him nicely he said no lets move on  coop whats up with your fixation on women who resemble tobey maguire  i think i finally got over that one i went to see spiderman 2 nothing  hi everybody thanks for the invite  i know im the new guy  so ill hang back and try not to disrupt the flow  so is there any protocols i need to know about  any customs traditions a talking stick  no theres no talking stick  but there is a shut the hell up shoe  okeydoke as you were  all right ive got something i wanna share  the panic attacks have come back and i just dont understand it  everything is great my career my marriage  i should be on cloud nine and instead of which  ive got this freefloating anxiety and feeling of impending doom  and the diarrhea  oh im sorry its just that my panic attacks come with diarrhea  first the clammy hands and then the nausea and then the aforementioned  you know sorry  i changed my mind i want him gone  can we shave his head and fill his mouth with hair first  let me tell you something about hair  the clammy hands thats how it starts  wait a minute you cant just kick him out like that  you didnt want him here in the first place  but im his brother its my right to reject him  you guys wanted him now that hes here cut him a little slack  cant you see he doesnt fit in here  of course not he doesnt fit in anywhere  hes a weird little guy who makes phone calls from the garage  its not his fault  his big brother didnt look after him didnt teach him anything  im trying to make up for it with his son  but this annoying little ship has sailed  thank you charlie you can stop now  no i got your back i want this twerp in the group  a problem with that is a problem with me  oh now youve got my back   what  a little late dont you think  alan im defending you  and im asking where youve been for the past 35 years  let me tell you what it was like growing up  unfreakingbelievable  what it was like to look up to no to worship someone  who on two occasions tried to trade you for an underwater flashlight  it wasnt for keeps  no no no its my turn now charlie  all i ever wanted was his approval his friendship  and all i ever got was my underwear yanked up to the base of my skull  and the sad part is that i looked forward to the wedgies  because it was the only form of love that i could get from him   that is sad charlie  its terrible  charlie dont you think theres something you have to say to your brother  yeah  come here buddy  okay buddy  heres the gag  in the words of some wag  she loves my flag  rally round the flag  wow elvis that was beautiful  but you know in all honesty  i really loved
