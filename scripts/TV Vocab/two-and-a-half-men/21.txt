by the hour just listen to her and do what she says  youre the boss ill get right on it  what did she say  she wants me to write a statement  and she wants you to take jake out and buy him a new gameboy  why would she want that  for gods sake alan youre paying this woman  a lot of money i suggest you take her advice  jake were going out  i just want to make it clear that i would never behave in a way  that would negatively influence my nephew  what was that is she allowed to do that  mr harper how many women would you say  you have sexual relations with in any given year  excuse me  i do okay  ten twenty one hundred   come on i dont keep count  so well say 10  i dont see the relevance of this  we are trying to establish mr harpers lifestyle  as a way of determining whether his home is a suitable environment  for a young boy  okay let me just say here that i love jake  and i make it my business to see that nothing goes on in front of him   that is in any way inappropriate  you tell him charlie  and its significantly north of 10  i think we can move on do you have any more questions   you are doing very well  thanks  mr harper is it true that jake saw a woman in the shower with you  okay yes  now in that instance the door was closed  he didnt knock  and the door was closed and  and im sorry what was the question   woman in the shower  dont help them  and most important he didnt see anything inappropriate  then what can you tell us about this picture that jake drew  okay now thats a totally different whoa man  whoaman woman  she was in my kitchen wearing a tshirt  and she reached up for some  spaghettios  thats what she was reaching for  id like a moment to confer with my witness  you are making me so hot  i see  look stuart we both know youre on a fishing expedition here right   maybe  maybe  you have no case this man is a wonderful uncle  he provides a beautiful home  and the last time i looked  it wasnt against the law to be single in the united states of america  oh god  bless america  amen  the good news is your wife has given up on the custody issue  but we still need to finalize the property settlement  all right  now aside from your books shes requested a few other specific items   like what  a massage chair  oh no forget it i love that chair  that was the only thing in my bedroom that moved when i touched it  dont worry alan i will get you your chair  i will get you your books i will fight for you i will win for you  and i wont stop until your wife is squished like a bug on a windshield  okay lets not lose sight of the fact that this bug is the mother of my child  so lets just keep the squishing to a minimum  dont worry you dont need a bathing suit  once youre drunk the oceans not cold at all   charlie  hey alan  and laura  hello laura  i didnt know you were here   hi charlie crystal  hey  yeah i guess you guys know each other  hows that flu  its better  this calls for a drink a very large drink  im not getting billed for her time now am i  charlie  okay i know this is awkward  but lets keep in mind we agreed  that you and i were just a casual deal two consenting adults no strings no drama  im willing to admit that trying to boink your assistant might   charlie  yeah  now  what  i want you now  but see nows really not a good time i mean youre working with my brother  and crystal took a sick day  okay thats a good point  let me think this through  all right theres just one way to make this work  i dont do threesomes charlie   then im stumped  whats going on  nothing not a thing   charlie theres no reason to lie  are you sure  there usually is  im a little upset with your brother for getting involved with my assistant  i mean it could be construed as a breach of ethics  nice going charlie this wont affect my case will it  no of course not alan im a professional  if were going to make it to that settlement conference on time  maybe you should put on a jacket and tie nothing too nice  youre good  do you think you can keep it in your pants till i get my stuff back  im trying harder than you think  okay weve got 15 minutes where do you want to do this  hold on  its not that im not into risky semipublic sex  its just that i am starting to resent your attitude  charlie we have a deal  okay laura look  i only went along with that because  you are hot and it took little to no effort on my part  just make yourself at home crystal thats the ocean  anyway i think we might be done here   youre dumping me  yep  now  you are going to be very sorry charlie harper  yeah girls have been using that tired old line on me since the fifth grade  the next item is the rare book collection appraised at 12000  actually our appraisers came in at 16500   yeah  enjoy them  what   i was only asking for half  why break up a collection  okay whats next  i understand theres a dispute over the massage chair  not anymore we concede  what do you mean we concede were not here for conceding  were here for fighting and winning and squishing remember   alan i know what im doing  okay moving on to the retirement fund   take it  take it   take it  ill take it  are you out of your mind   okay what else would you like  what else  judith for gods sake remember there was a time when you loved me  cool  that was quick  yeah like every other time judith screwed me   what happened  ill tell you what happened  my settlement conference turned in to a driveby colonoscopy  charlie have you ever heard of a divorce agreement  that requires the exhusband   to pay the exwifes dry cleaning for life  wow  yeah not just clothes  drapes rugs  slip covers even suede  sounds like she really took you to the cleaners  sorry  so i fired laura and tore up the agreement  im going to have to find a new attorney and just start all over  good then no harm no foul  except for the thousands of dollars of extra legal fees  yeah thats got to sting a little  not as much as having to buy judiths parents a retirement condo in boca raton  she didnt even ask for that laura just threw it in  lawyers  but you know what the interesting thing is  no what  after it was all over  and judith and her attorney went dancing out of the room  i asked laura why she had done this to me  and she said and i quote ask your brother   so here i am asking you  why charlie  why did my very expensive beverly hills divorce lawyer sell me out  okay ill tell you the whole story  but maybe you should sit down first  english
