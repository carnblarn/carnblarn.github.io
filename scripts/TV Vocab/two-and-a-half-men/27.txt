                i dont know what he did charlie  the teacher called and told me to come get him  i want it on the record that if the kid was running  a blackjack game under bleachers he didnt get it from me  what i said he didnt  well i can assure you he did not learn that kind of crass behavior from me  maybe i should wait in the hall  hold on what is he doing here  well my car is in the shop and charlie was nice enough to give me a ride  no charlie was nice enough to call you a cab but you wouldnt take it  so whats going on  your son gave his teacher the bird  okay i want it on the record that he didnt necessarily  charlie just leave it alone what exactly happened  i was writing on the board and he thought i couldnt see him   is this true  yeah i really thought she couldnt see  im afraid this kind of behavior is grounds for suspension   maybe we can catch a matinee  yeah  jake why did you flip miss pasternak off  excuse me we dont end our sentences with prepositions  we say why did you flip off miss pasternak  i think that answers your question  jake why did you flip off miss pasternak  because she picks on me  jake i dont treat you any differently than any of the other students   yeah right  shut up  you know id like to talk to your parents alone   come on jake  what i dont even get to tell my side  buddy youre 11 you have no side  this isnt my fault i was provoked   you were provoked  yeah it means  i know what it means  and it doesnt matter what you need to do now is apologize   but im not sorry  you dont have to be sorry  just say it and look it youve got those big cute kid eyes use them   that would be lying  thats your line in the sand  you muttonhead you just flipped off your teacher   yeah but i was being honest  and look where it got you  i think i just lost my innocence  hes really a very wellbehaved boy  but he has had some problems dealing with our separation  thats true although it wasnt so much a separation as a kicking out  i sympathize but if i gave special consideration to every child  whose parents are going through divorce id be getting the finger all day  were not saying he shouldnt be punished   he certainly should  but just let us try to handle it  by us he means me i always have to be the bad guy  youre better at it than me  than i  you are such an ass   can we have a moment please  i think thatd be a good idea  and its may we have a moment please  stop it  miss pasternak im sorry we havent officially met   im jakes uncle charlie  hello  and i am really sorry this may not be my place  and if its not i am really sorry
