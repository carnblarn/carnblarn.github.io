post on the message board why not me   youre gonna post as yourself  dont be ridiculous  everybody uses a screen name  charliefreak219  too many  okay  charliefreak180  in my experience  charlie has always been  a generous lover  compassionate funioving and sensitive  there that ought to bring a little balance to the conversation  you really dont get the internet do you  oh look ive got a response already  dear freak are you just stupid  or did your skull bounce off his headboard too many times  okay ive had enough of this   how do i delete this whole thing  you cant delete a website  only the person who created it can   well how do i find out who created it  now lets see come on  okay  okay the domain is the property of a company in the cayman islands called  charlie harper sucks limited  well thats no help  hey you can buy tshirts and coffee mugs  add to cart  no mom it is not that simple  i am a single mother now dating is very complicated  i understand  no i can t go back to alan  of course i still love him  hey alan  how long you think this internet fad is gonna last   okay  what  jake mustve turned on his webcam before he went to school  i can see and hear judith

do something about that website  im gonna have to chase amish broads  judith wants to reconcile ive dreamed about this  but now that its here i wonder if its what i want  whoever put up that site has to be somebody i went out with at least once  it would be great for jake to have both parents in one house  and without alimony i could stop getting my hair cut at the barber college  i can eliminate married chicks ones that dont speak english  and those to whom i was never properly introduced  ill make a list of the pros and cons of going back to her  you know what im gonna need to make a list   im glad we talked  im always here for you  me too  hi tina long time huh  charlie harper what do you want  i know things didnt end well between us and  really i thought they ended perfectly  we spent a week in cancn having great sex every day  flew back to la you told me youd call me tomorrow and its been  what do you know a year and a half   that long  oh yeah  i guess time flies when youre the scum of the earth  okay i had that coming  i was thoughtless and insensitive and i know i can never really make up for it  but i want you to know that i was wrong and im really truly sorry   and  no and  i just wanted to apologize for being a jerk i wanna make amends   you really mean that dont you  i do absolutely   you wanna come in for a cup of coffee  sure i guess  so seeing anybody  pro no alimony con no sex  pro see jake all the time con see judith all the time  what are you doing give me that   im sorry it was just laying there  thats private  okay  i got another pro for you   yeah

youre not torn youre gutless   do you still love her  of course i do  i mean you know weve been though a lot of things together   shes the mother of my son  okay listen to me zippy  if thats all it took to make a marriage  id have a husband for each of my tattoos   you have tattoos  yeah you wanna see them  no  youre overthinking this when your dog dies you dont make a list  you bury him plant a shrub on top  tell the kids hes running around a farm and move on  thats actually a very apt metaphor  my failed marriage is like a dead dog  but it serves as fertilizer for the shrub which represents my new life  so if i try to revitalize the marriage you know digging up the dog   then im killing the shrub which is me  like you said its apt  thank you berta youre a very insightful woman  i know in a just world youd be washing my shorts  well thanks nevertheless  last chance to see those tattoos  no thanks  i can make the road runner do jumping jacks  that was a fun apology  yeah i really thought i was the one who deserved a spanking   so youll call me  count on it  hey not that i really care but do you happen to know  who started that silly website  no i just found it by googling your name  most women google the guys they go out with you know  yeah ive heard   well ill see you soon  you better  okay that went well  lets see whos next  jake why dont you go watch some tv i need to talk to your dad  is this about the firecrackers what firecrackers  ill go watch tv  come in sit down  thanks listen   boy this is tough  okay okay maybe  i can make it easier for you  judith  i will always love you  but theres no going back for me  ive learned a lot about myself in the last year and im growing  and and i wanna keep on growing  i will always cherish what we had  but i have to fertilize my shrub   what are you talking about  its bertas metaphor  the the bottom line is i dont want to reconcile  our marriage is over  well what makes you think i wanna reconcile  what did you wanna talk to me about  my mom wanted me to ask if jake could spend a couple of weeks  with them this summer  oh really   thats what she wanted you to ask me  yes  you didnt tell her you loved me you missed me  well i always tell her that to shut her up  and how the hell do you know what i talk to my mother about  hey look charlies here   answer my question alan  hold on a second judith   charlie whats wrong  ive been making amends  five amends in one afternoon  well technically four i had to fake the last one   charlie alan and i are talking  dont worry  ill be out of your way as soon as i check on something  they all denied running the website  but at least i should have some good reviews now  listen to this  charlie came over and apologized today and oh what an apology it was  i take back everything nasty i ever said about him  not bad huh  heres another one  he apologized to you today  he apologized to me too  okay i have a bad feeling again  alan how do you know what i said to my mother  i didnt actually know i surmised  i should go talk to charlie  hey dad check it out i can see my room on your computer  okay now ive got a bad feeling  my heart was in the right place rose
