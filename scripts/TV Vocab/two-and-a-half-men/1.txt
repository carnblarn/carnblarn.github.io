is going off  hey its charlie do your thing when you hear the beep  hi monkey man  i was just thinking about you  and wondering why we hurt each other so much  rose its me monkey man   charlie  yeah listen let me ask you a question  is there something inherently wrong with  asking a woman youre involved with if she wants kids  charlie we got a good thing going why do you want to mess it up  look at you all grown up and back living with mom  how good do you feel about yourself right now  on a scale of one to two  im not back living with mom  im simply staying here till judith and i work things out  so one  what do you want charlie  i figured youve been here a couple of weeks  you got to have blood in your stool by now  so i thought if you and jake wanted to come back to my place for a while   thatd be okay  wait a minute  are you saying you want me to come back and live with you  well truthfully no  i want jake to come back and live with me  but i figure youre a package deal  thanks but were doing just fine here with mom  come on we cant let jake be exposed to her on any kind of ongoing basis  theres no ongoing basis hes only here on weekends  thats too much  piranhas can strip an entire cow in an hour  alan weve got to get him away from her i mean look what happened to us  and what happened to you  hi mom  charlie youre a grown man  perhaps its time to stop blaming your mother for your own shortcomings  alan the divan is not for sitting  charlie get off the couch  uncle charlie  theres my good boy  and what did i tell you about yelling in the house  grandma im suffocating
