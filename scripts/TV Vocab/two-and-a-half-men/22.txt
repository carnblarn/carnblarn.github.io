money  bet you feel pretty stupid huh  what do you want me to do  judith is insisting he comes here once a week  okay look nobody likes divorce but there are certain advantages  one of the more popular ones  is you get to tell your exwife to bite the big one   or whatever you got left  yeah  thatll help look its just an hour out of our day  which couldve been spent on air hockey and bowling alley martinis  its a small price to pay to avoid aggravating judith   okay i understand  thank you  youre a big girl  okay are there any out here   no  good  well see you next saturday  doctor you should know he doesnt really see dead people  of course not hes just trying to resolve  emotional issues through visualized fantasy  do you have my check  dad how come we never got spare ribs when we

thought youd like to know that your brother is sleepwalking again  and you had to get in bed with me to tell me that  no silly i was already in bed with you  i just heard him walking around downstairs  alan   what are you doing  making a birthday cake  you and mom want some  you handle this honey im going back to bed   jake your grandmothers here  oh man  i mean right here in the room  oh man grandmas here   i blame you  take a number  how could we be out of eggs  dr linda freeman child psychologist who heres seeing a child psychologist  jake  his mom was concerned about you know the impact of the divorce and everything   on who  on jake  ill be right back im gonna go get some eggs  jake honey i just want you to know  that seeing a therapist is no reflection on you   okay  its a reflection on your parents  particularly your mother  i think were gonna get a cat   the queen of darkness is here  thanks for the headsup   where you going  were out of eggs  and you have no idea why  well charlie i would assume somebody ate them  okay lets go with that  and then i tried freudian analysis but with them you know its just sex   my doctor has a cow puppet  really   md or phd  cow   hey ma can i talk to you for a minute  ill be right there  now honey the cow puppet doesnt need to know about the time  you saw grandmommy dancing with the cuban gentleman  in the neiman marcus changing room  what is it charlie  i need to talk to you about alan hes been acting really strange lately  and i suppose its my fault  no well maybe  the thing is hes been sleepwalking  and i remember him doing it when he was a kid  yes it was shortly after your father passed away   whatd you do about it  well nothing really  it seemed to stop by itself when he was 13  right around the time he started taking those long showers  and relieving his anxiety in a more direct way  got it so sexual release cured his sleepwalking  seemed to of course there was a brief time when the two overlapped  i recall an incredibly awkward bridge game  okay great thanks  i had seven no trump and he just walked in  with this goofy smile on his face  this is nice great idea charlie  i figure you work all week you got your kid on the weekends  i bet you hardly even have the time to take a nice long soapy shower   yeah it has been a little hectic  let me ask you something  whens the last time you had sex with a girl  or a melon or anything   none of your business  that long   why do you care  i dont know  you just have that twitchy look of a guy whos got one stuck in the chamber  im fine charlie  yeah sure id like to meet somebody  but in the meantime im living a very full life  i have no complaints this table is really starting to piss me off  just let it wobble  you want beer in your lap cause i dont want beer on my lap  hi charlie whos your cute friend  just get up here you jackass  hi charlie whos your cute friend  hi darlene this is my brother alan  come please join us   hi alan this is my friend annette  hi   hello  hey he is cute  you are  you know alan annette is a seatfiller for most of the major awards shows   is that so  yeah its a big responsibility  cause when a celebrity gets up to go the bathroom  they dont want to have an empty seat on tv  understandable  you know who pees a lot jeff bridges  what do you say we leave and go back to our place   okeydokey  wait just hold it   everybody sit down  i feel like im at work   what is going on  nothing  we met a couple of girls who took a shine to us   just like that  yes alan just like that   god please tell me you did not pay them  hey i resent that  not all seatfillers hook  well it was very nice meeting you im leaving  be right back keep drinking   what is wrong with you  me  there is nothing wrong with me im just  im not interested in being set up with a woman  whose idea of chitchat is celebrity peepee secrets   how about the other one  no  you sure cause theres no way youre banging her on your own   why is this so important to you  are you kidding me  youve been acting nuttier than rat crap in a pistachio factory  i figured if i could coax your johnson out of retirement  youd stop making invisible birthday cakes   what  i cant say it more clearly than that alan  are you happy  anyway i know you only deal with kids but i didnt know where else to take him  this is ridiculous i dont need to be here  i gave you a choice take the long shower or talk to the doctor  okay  well if i had to guess and thats pretty much all i do here  i would have to say that  based on his inappropriate outbursts and sleepwalking  alan is struggling with a great deal of suppressed rage  rage no i dont think so  come on your wife threw you out of your own house  she still runs your life youre broke  and you only get to see your kid two days a week  one of which you have to bring him to this rug rat exorcist  no offense  okay  now alan how do you feel about what charlie just shared  i think hes completely off base yes i get a little frustrated sometimes  and when judith doesnt get her own way she just keeps coming at me  and coming at me like a frigging steamroller   crushing my spirit and my selfrespect  thats very good  but on the other hand shes a very good mom to jake  okay ill tell you what lets pretend  that judith is sitting in this chair  what would you tell her right now  boy i dont know i feel a little silly talking to an empty chair  fair enough charlie do you mind   do i mind what  thank you  now alan tell judith how you really feel  well judith  i know youre working through some of your own issues   sexual and otherwise and i support that  thats telling her alan  charlie remember youre judith  sorry  thats telling me alan  is this gonna take much longer  cause i have to get to a massage then a tennis lesson that hes paying for   tennis since when do you play tennis  i told you but you never listen  he never listens thank god his brother took him in   okay i am warning you  youre warning me  okay alan how are you feeling right now   well a little angry  really cause you dont sound angry  well i am  i just dont see any reason to make a big spectacle of myself  yeah youd rather blow off a sure thing who actually makes a living with her ass  meaningless loveless sex is not the answer charlie   meow fitchoo  okay  i am really getting tired of that  hey you know what charlie i dont much care for that either  if you like we can schedule another session  to deal with your fear of vaginas  now alan the reason i asked you if you were angry  is because i have yet to see any genuine expression  of what are undoubtedly some very powerful feelings  im sorry but thats just the best i can do  okay well lets try something else  this is called a bataca  its heavily padded it cant hurt anyone  but you can use it to vent your deep angry feelings  youre wasting your time doc hes too much of a wimp  attaboy alan let it go  good  im so mad i hate you   who do you hate alan who do you hate  everybody   good let it go keep going alan  wait a minute stop  should i stop  well its up to you you paid for the full hour so  attaboy hit him  thank you doctor that was great i feel much better   good  yeah were all thrilled for you  and by the way about the you know  im not scared of them i just have a healthy respect  fine well see you both next week  how long am i gonna have to keep coming here  english
