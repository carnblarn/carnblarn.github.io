constantly surprised that youve been screwed  and you dont wanna pay for it   morning  morning  did you drop off the dry cleaning by the back door  that was dry cleaning  i thought you were throwing that stuff out  you threw out my clothes  i gave them to my sisters husband earl  you gave three cashmere sweaters and a new sport coat to your brotherinlaw  why shouldnt he have nice things  hes paid his debt to society  you have to get them back  i wish i could but earls got one withered arm  and he had all the left sleeves hemmed  those were expensive clothes berta  wanna take it out in trade

that works out for you  i guess we know whos in charge around here  if i want your opinion ill ask your exwife  oh yeah oh yeah well if i want your opinion  ill ask one of the dozens of women you have meaningless casual sex with  oh ouch   hey uncle charlie  what   i love you  what did you do jake  i love you too dad   what did he do  how am i supposed to know  well hes your knuckleheaded son  hes my knuckleheaded son now but when youre trawling for tail  at the home depot hes your slow but adorable nephew  i might as well get one perk out of having you sponge off me   sponge sponge  oh thats a good idea  well let me tell you something  take away your fancy house your fancy car  your women and what have you got  a betteriooking version of you  have i mentioned how much i hate you  have i mentioned how much i hate you   dont copy me  dont copy me   youre an idiot  youre an idiot   im warning you charlie  im warning you charlie  how childish  would you mind toasting my buns please  to your buns  you sicken me  hey   hey rose  whats going on  just making lunch   wanna join us  maybe some other time  a little garlic butter is also a good way to jazz up a hamburger bun  hes lucky all im doing is spitting  it doesnt take a masters in behavioral psychology which i happen to have  to see that you and you brother have unresolved fraternal conflicts  gee you think  i think it might be therapeutic for you two  to sit down with someone and explore those conflicts   you mean you  well i could refer you  to the woman i talk to but she doesnt exist  so yeah me  lets see couples counseling for me and alan with you as the therapist  why dont we just drop acid run out into the ocean  and pretend were dolphins  youre exhibiting a lot of hostility charlie  you know what we psychologists call that   what  hostility  why would we need more than one word for it  rose i appreciate your concern but alan and i dont need therapy  everything will work itself out  im just saying i think it would really help you guys  if you could sit down and share your feelings  were fine rose   choke on it princess  bite me bitch  i think he may have anticipated that   how freudian  its not freudian  but mines bigger  its a banana you moron  its not just about you and charlie you know  theres that innocent little moppet to consider  moppet  im baking air biscuits get them while theyre hot  he may not be able to process it now  but he picks up on all the negative emotion around here  save yourselves run for your lives  okay well if you can get charlie to agree ill do it   good  and as a rule  when says theyre bad take his word for it  oh please alan i grew up with two older brothers and  oh my god  the only reason i let him live here is because of jake  go on  he was a pain in the ass when we were kids  and now hes blossomed into a threefingered prostate exam  have you considered the possibility that since youre the older brother  you harbor resentment towards him  for usurping mommys love and attention  im sorry have you met my mother  okay so thats a no  please dont try to psychoanalyze me  oh charlie psychoanalysis takes years  im just messing around inside your head  have you ever considered the possibility  that you are the primary male role model in alans life  and if his behavior is making you mad he learned it from you  so in fact you are making you mad  thats nuts  just sit with it for a moment i think its a pretty good insight  no im gonna stick with nuts  and i dont wanna continue this  do you feel you cant be totally honest with me  since we slept together  no  why cant you be totally honest   i can be totally honest with you  really  how much did you like having sex with me  lets go talk to alan  and they wouldnt give me a license  all right let the healing begin you pinhead  can we refrain from counterproductive namecalling  such big words from such a little head  charlie please sit down  okay here are the ground rules  there will be no namecalling and no interrupting  the purpose of this is to air our feelings without judgment   alan why dont you start  why does he start   would you like to start  no  then shut up  alan youll go first  and begin with the phrase i feel charlie is blank  i dont think i can top that  okay i feel like charlie is  ashamed to have me as a brother  well there you go are we done  charlie youll get your turn  when was the first time you felt that way alan  i guess on the playground  the first day of kindergarten he told his friends  that i was a shaved monkey our mom won in a poker game  charlie why do you think you might have said something like that  well i guess deep down  i always wanted a shaved monkey  you promised mom you would look after me  i was 7 years old you cant trust a 7yearold  you know how he looks after me he gave me wedgies  from kindergarten on i got daily wedgies  my butt cheeks didnt unclench until my second year of college  at which point a long stick slid out  lets try a little roleplaying  he put dog poop in my mork and mindy lunchbox  oh will you please let that go  and by the way if you think it through  we didnt have a dog  what  mom told me to make you lunch i made you lunch  oh my god do you see  what i have been dealing with my entire life  the real genius was putting it in a hotdog bun  all through the second grade  he would introduce me as his ugly sister alana  thats because all through second grade you wore culottes  they were extra roomy bermuda shorts i was prone to chafing  charlie how did you feel when you were calling alan a monkey or a girl  or putting excrement in his lunchbox  its hard to describe  it was kind of a warm satisfied feeling  and why do you think you felt that way  because he was such a smartass  straight as mommys favorite daddys boy stepdaddys boy  somebody had to take him down a peg   you were jealous of me  no no   i was annoyed  i dont believe it   you were jealous  no i wasnt   sounds like you were charlie  you cant take sides   thats unprofessional  professional  im just making this up as i go along  im drawing kittycats here  all these years you had to put me down  because you secretly believed that i was better than you  no thats ridiculous  i knew i was better but i didnt think you knew  no no i didnt know that there was nothing to know  i dont buy it you were an emotionally wounded child  i wasnt wounded i was the wounder  he was the woundee  i was a mean rotten brother youve gotta believe me  i tortured him  once i convinced him the clothes dryer was a time machine  when he got out i was dressed in pilgrim clothes  and threatened to burn him as a witch  and now i understand why you did all those things   and i forgive you  dont forgive me  hate me fear me   come here  no   come on give me a hug  no forget it   would you rather hug me  what would be the point of that  it gets me hot  all right if itll put an end to all this one hug  hey what are you doing  lets see how you like a wedgie wheres your underwear  im not wearing any but thanks for scratching my ass   this turned out to be a nice weekend  yeah go figure  who wouldve thought rose would be
