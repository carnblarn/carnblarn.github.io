only in the air for 90 seconds  okay youre kidding and its funny  but the truth is you and i see each other every day  and we dont know much about each other  so you wanna know what goes on underneath this gruff exterior  whether somewhere inside me theres a tiny little girl  who once dreamed of being a famous ballerina   is there  lf there is  its because i accidentally ate one and havent passed her yet  let me tell you i am dreading that tiara   okay well it was nice talking to you  hey i feel closer  oh are you starting that book report already   just making notes  good for you what do you have so far  lord of the flies is kind of like survivor but with kids  thats an interesting analogy whats your favorite part  when the first kid gets voted off the island  hey all right  stop trying to be friends with berta it just pisses her off  what doesnt  hey i was gonna do some shopping and was hoping you could watch jake   sure  ready when you are alan   be right there ill see you later  no wait wait wait hold on   youre going out with rose again  no im not going out with her   were just going shopping  morning charlie  you havent forgotten that shes a little bent right  no i think theres a lot more to her than that   deep down theres a good person  deep down theres a few good people  and all of them are bent   hell be right with you rose  okay   charlie everybody has flaws  flaws  she superglued my testicles to my thigh  that was the past weve all done things were ashamed of  shes not ashamed she took a picture then used it for her christmas card  thank god it was an extreme closeup most people thought it was a fruit bat  okay well i appreciate your concern  but i think rose is a sweet smart interesting woman  i enjoy spending time with her meet me out front  okeydokey   hey whatre you doing  reading lord of the flies  not important   now listen youre a kid right  yeah  okay im writing a song for kids  so assuming that what ive done already blows   it does  yeah yeah yeah  assuming that you need to help me make it better   but i have to do a book report  okay  ill help you with the book report you help me with the song   quid pro quo  no  oshikuru  here you go raspberrymangobanana with a shot of wheatgrass   thank you  my pleasure  you know sometimes i like to come to the mall  and just watch people and make up stories about who they are  and what their lives are like  oh well thats fun  what about that lady over there what do you think her life is like  well id say shes a smart woman but very ionely  so used to rejection its become like the air she breathes  which is all the more sad because shes got so much to give  emotionally spiritually sexually especially sexually  she is ripe smoldering and willing to try anything   what about that lady over there  her  well lets see shes a little tougher to read  id say shes a smart woman very ionely  so used to rejection its become like the air she breathes  which is all the more sad  see even though oshikuru is for kids its not really a kids comic   its very mature  okay i think i got it  the demons oshikuru fights only exist  because they are a reflection of the tortured demons in his own soul   yes  so in essence  oshikuru is like a japanese scifi version of moby dick   what  you said moby dick  i mean sure being single can be ionely sometimes  but its better than being together with someone you dont love or respect   is that what your marriage was like  well according to my exwife it was  hey as long as were done here  why dont we take a drive down to the beach and take a walk   alan are you flirting with me  oh no no  i just thought you know since its a beautiful day  if you are its okay   really  yeah  theres a lot more to you than i thought   what did you think  oh lets not spoil the moment  okay so what do we do now   wanna try kissing  yes i think we should   okay  yeah   wanna get a room  excuse me  or we can go back to my place unless youre afraid of ferrets   ferrets  yeah  i have five of the toothy little guys  no kidding five ferrets   those are like long furry rats right  yep  and theyre all named charlie  of course they are  well as much as i would love to meet  charlie and charlie and charlie and charlie   and charlie  right  i cant help but wonder is it worth putting our friendship at risk  well thats a good question lets think about it for a minute  how good are you in bed because im excellent  truthfully im more of an advanced intermediate   then lets stay friends  yeah good idea   can i ask you a question  sure  what specifically turned you off to the idea of a physical liaison  was it the psychosexual fraternal rivalry symbolized by the charlie surrogates  or the prospect of being judged inadequate  by a woman who professes to have superior sexual skills  wait a minute have you been doing that behavioral psychology thing on me  no dont be silly  but if i said yes would that make you feel a angry or b insecure  i thought you were gonna write the report for me  no jake that would be wrong  the only way to learn is to do the work yourself  now these are called cliff notes  inside is everything you need to know about lord of the flies  the themes the characters the symbolism  its a book report waiting for you to put your name on it  is that legal  look around do you see any homework police  oh man i give you way too much credit  oh i meant to ask you howd that book report turn out   i got a dminus  dminus   didnt you read the cliff notes  that was 50 pages  unbelievable your kids too lazy to cheat  has it occurred to you that maybe hes too honest to cheat  no im lazy   oshikuru demon samurai  hey its on  oh oh oh oshikuru oh oh oh oshikuru  my oh my hes a demon samurai  who s the guy who had to die oshikuru  thats not what we wrote thats your original sucky version  what can i tell you the network liked that one better   what are they braindamaged  welcome to show business kid  i still think its snappy  oshikuru
