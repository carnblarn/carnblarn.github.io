first he forgets me now he leaves me with you  hey you know what  your father works like a dog to make sure you have everything  if hes not there for you  its just because hes trying to stay out of federal prison  i think he needs to have sex  i was kidding about prison jake  what do you mean he needs to have sex  well hes been really grumpy lately  youre usually in a good mood i figure its

with you   are you trying to kill me  you could be right about the sex thing  okay woodward avenue elementary school  looks like theyre closed  thats because im an hour late even the crossing guard is gone  how about this why dont you just bag school and well go catch a movie   i cant skip school im in the play  what play  the founding fathers play youll be there right  why would i be there  because moms in hawaii and dads got that tax thing and youre all thats left  oh im all thats left  hey im not thrilled about it either  okay where and when  in the auditorium after lunch  oh yeah i

mole a top hat were done  because lincoln wasnt a founding father  okay ill see what i can do  now get out of here  hey  you forgot your lunch  hey  god what a day  i dont wanna hear it  you know why i was being audited  not because i have unsubstantiated deductions which i have  not because i take the occasional cash payment from a client  and forget to report it which i do  it was because no one at the irs  could believe i was paying as much alimony as i claimed  it took me three hours to convince them that yes  i am that big a schmuck  oh boohoo  you want a real fun time  try finding an extra small ben franklin costume  at 900 in the morning  oh right the play how was it  boffo a smash  among the highlights were a 12yearold chinese george washington  with a powdered wig and a snot bubble  and your kid in a bald cap and granny glasses  holding a tweety bird kite and announcing hes discovered elasticity   oh i wish id seen it  dont worry you will  it was videotaped from about 150 different angles  i should tell him im sorry i wasnt there   yeah you should  is he in his room  here you go pal your favorite  bacon double cheeseburger and cheese fries  and for dessert i got fudge brownies with that ice cream you like  is this supposed to make up for everything   yeah  pretty much  look jake i know its been rough and im sorry  were human we make mistakes but i promise you
