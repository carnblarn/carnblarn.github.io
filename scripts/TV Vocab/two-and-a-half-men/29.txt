probably  unless her real date didnt start until later  and she just didnt wanna eat alone  what  oh come on charlie doublebooking  you practically invented it  no she wouldnt do that to me why would she do that to me  did she do that to me she did that to me didnt she   excuse me  sorry  i was just taking a little selfish delight in your pain  the germans call it schadenfreude  but here in the usa we just go   thanks  oh charlie  you dont need a girl like that you could do so much better  youre right i can  she doesnt call when she says she will  she wont let me sleep over shes obviously seeing other guys  so why cant i get her out of my head  okay thats not where i was going but lets review  shes gorgeous but shes also selfcentered  shes promiscuous shes commitmentphobic   oh my god  what  im dating myself  no wonder the sex is so good  trust me youll feel better having this done   well have the weekend to have fun  what if we dont have fun  then all this studying will be for nothing  thats just a risk well have to take  now what year did magellan circumnavigate the globe   its not gonna be on the test  maybe not  it wouldnt hurt for you to know it  why would i wanna know something i dont have to  because maybe youll need to know it in the future  well then thats when ill learn it  why cant you just learn it now  theres only so much space in my brain  that if you put magellan in there i might forget my locker combination   charlie help me out here  what  jake doesnt think he needs to know anything about magellan  whats magellan  okay im out of here wont be late  oh im sorry bad news from the clinic  no im just taking sherri out for a nice dinner  after which i plan to gently but firmly  extricate myself from the relationship  so she got bad news from the clinic  theres no bad news theres no clinic   im just ending it  why  because shes a selfcentered manipulative narcissist  so are you  hello  he said narcissist  its not a dirty word  what does it mean  if you wanna know look it up in the dictionary  okay  hes not coming back   thank you steven  its stephan  sure it is  listen sherri we need to talk   youre a terrific woman but  you look so hot tonight  really   that was incredible  yeah it was wasnt it  its funny how things work out  an hour ago i wasnt feeling too good about us  i gotta get up early again tomorrow  so if you dont mind  there you go elvis peanut butter and bananas   my mom cuts it diagonally  yeah  well thats the way i learned to cut it in prison  thank you  alan got a riddle for you  whats short picky and only supposed to be here on weekends  ill give you a hint its your kid  i know i know his mother decided  she had to go to palm springs to rejuvenate herself  detox  no a health spa six hundred dollars a day  for meditation and colonics  how in the hell do you meditate  when someones squirting water up your business  i dont think they happen simultaneously berta  thats good because it could be very distracting  i cant even pee when the cats watching me  nobody answer the phone  please let it be her please please please  no wait berta you answer it  no no no let it ring  no answer it   harper residence  im not here   yeah hes here  okay im here  jake its your mother  so hows it going down there you struck oil yet  charlie what is going on with you   what  what do you mean what  youre spending half your time drinking and moping  the other half sleeping and throwing up  you havent been out of the house all week  you want me to go out like this in public  if you feel so strongly about this girl why dont you just call her  yeah sure i could call her  i could also fedex her my testicles in a little silk bag  all the more reason to call first and give her a headsup  alan dont you understand this isnt about dating anymore  its not even about sex its about selfrespect and pride  yeah well i think that ship has sailed charlie  see the problem is she doesnt need me  so i need to figure out a way to show her  that i dont need her just as much as she doesnt need me  but without seeming needy  you see my dilemma  actually i think i do  you feel like i felt when judith kicked me out  all right if youre gonna mock me this conversations over   who took my sandwich  go do your homework  unbelievable   im glad you were free tonight  im glad i was home when you called  i wouldve called sooner but its been a crazy week  its okay i understand   oh charlie i want you  are you sure   oh yeah  how much   cant you tell  i wanna hear it  i need you i ache for you  okay then   what are you doing  ive gotta get home  i got an early meeting   what  beat you to it this time didnt i  what are you talk what kind of game are you playing here  the same game youre playing only tonight i win  really what is it that youre winning  charlie im lying here hungry for your body and youre walking away  so what exactly is it that youre winning  you know   get out  its too late  you cant kick me out i already said im leaving  hey   so howd it go  great  i took control i regained my selfrespect  i walked out of there with my head held high  good for you good for you so youre done beating yourself up  not quite  jake wait till we get inside  im hungry uncle charlies in there  i see your point  at the risk of asking a foolish question  you got any homework this weekend   nope did it at school  really   yup did it during detention  jake why did you have detention  because i didnt do my homework yesterday  so you did yesterdays homework and todays homework  yup the extracredit section and everything   oh great ill look it over  okay i didnt do it   jake why do you keep lying  because i thought you trusted me  the detention part was true  hi charlie  hey rose whats going on  i just stopped by to say im sorry things didnt work out  with you and sherri  yeah thanks  and im sorry for my schadenfreude the other day  ive been riddled with glaukenschtuken ever since   glauken  schtuken  it means  feeling guilty for having felt schadenfreude   theyve got a word for that  not yet  but im hoping glaukenschtuken catches on  ill do my part  you know something good did come out of all this  watching you obsess over sherri  really helped me understand my obsession for you  i mean you never return my calls you always see other women  you never knowingly let me sleep over  and yet ive never been able to get you out of my head   interesting  isnt it  but now that i understand it i feel somehow free of it  well thats great rose it sounds like a real healthy breakthrough  yeah and the best part is now that the fog of obsession has lifted  i can stop idealizing you and see you for who you really are  and who would that be  an emotionally scarred and deeply flawed human being  who will one day bless me  with emotionally scarred and deeply flawed children  rose  just hold me  i like the names mike and trudy
