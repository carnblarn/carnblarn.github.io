happen  you know communication selfreflection  personal growth crap like that  the important thing is i now have a much deeper appreciation  for what do you call them traditional values  traditional values  this from a guy who offered my sister a car  if shed come to bed with us  it was a joke and i was drunk  but still it shows a yearning for family   okay this is going nowhere  lisa wait im
