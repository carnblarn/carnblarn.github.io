scrubbing  wait a minute  and suddenly i realized  i might have left it in my moms car  hey mom did i leave my game boy in your car  well can you go look  cant you just dry off and put on a robe  theres another 25 chip in it for you  she wasnt wearing a ring there was no mention of a husband  is that supposed to cheer me up   no no no i just wanted you to know  now now i get it  youre a nice guy and i married a skeevy tramp  no no no i mean yeah i am a nice guy  but im sure annette is a lovely woman  her name is natalie   really you sure  yes im sure  because ive been yelling annette all night  her name is natalie  well then maybe this is all just a huge misunderstanding  and ive been upstairs doing someone elses wife  fivefoot six long brown hair butterfly tattoo on her left hip
