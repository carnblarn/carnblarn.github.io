faster in polish   funny language isnt it  yeah hilarious  the earthquake hit sherman oaks a lot harder than malibu   what earthquake  what earthquake  about an hour ago you didnt feel the house shaking  unbelievable you actually thought that was you  no i thought it was her you know because of me  the good news is unless they report it on polish tv  i still get the credit  im thrilled for you anyway judith called  a pipe broke soaked her living room carpet  and shes completely freaking out  yeah well thats the difference between wife and exwife  with exwife you dont even have to pretend to care  well im sorry i cant be that callous  have you even tried  shes the mother of my son im concerned about her welfare  i told her she could stay here until repairs  whoa whoa whoa whoa back up back up  when you told her did you have like a sarcastic chuckle in your voice  like you know  yeah right judith you can stay here   its just for a couple of days  a couple of days  jack the ripper just killed a couple of prostitutes  it was still wrong   do you want me to put her in a hotel  yeah put her in a hotel  put her in a space capsule put her in a catapult and see how far she flies  charlie i cant do that to her  again have you even tried   shes afraid of another quake  well what about what im afraid of   what are you afraid of  oh lets see large birds small bugs  unplanned pregnancies and your exwife living in my house  come on charlie shes just a small frightened woman  there are no small frightened women thats a myth  perpetrated by the large angry women who secretly run the world  i think it would be healthy for jake to see his mother and father  living together as friends  oh alan grow up  as long as hes got pizza with cheese and tv with 150 channels  he doesnt give a rats ass what you guys do  now that i think about it neither do i  that had better be a big pregnant bird covered with spiders   i dont know how to thank you  im glad youre okay  charlie i know this is a big imposition i really appreciate you inviting me  i thought she should know this was your idea  actually i had several other ideas wanna hear them  tell jake youre here ill take your bags  thank you alan thank you both  i promise ill be out of here in a couple of days   judith sit down ive got it covered  no i can pitch in  where do you keep the salad tongs wait i got them   better use the wooden ones  whats wrong with these  i use those whenever i drop my watch in the toilet  this is a regular occurrence   youd think id learn  and you keep them in the kitchen  i used to hang them in the bathroom but it freaked some chicks out  hes just kidding with you use the wooden ones  i dont want any salad   well you have to have some  dad doesnt make me have salad  alan  hes exaggerating we have salad all the time  i just dont eat it  its kind of our compromise  okay fine your house your rules  technically its my house his rules  of course just have a little salad  so i spoke with the plumbing company  and theyll be there in the morning  so ill drop off jake and meet them on my way to work   thank you alan  youre welcome  this is really weird  why your mom and i may not be living together anymore but were still friends  i dont flip off my friends when i talk to them on the phone  nice shooting  two with one bullet  well if either of us did in fact do that it was wrong  the important thing is were making an effort to be nicer to each other  thats right and your mom staying here is a good example of that  very nicely put alan  if we leave now we can be in mexico in two hours  hey  hey   wheres alan  dont know  mind if i join you  sure  thanks again for your hospitality  dont mention it  you know the tv in your room works  oh okay good to know  i just

shes leaving  just for a little while   wheres she going  just out to dinner  you know with a friend i guess its a date of some sort  shes going on a date  of some sort   and youre okay with this  oh yeah  we talked about it i think its a sign of maturity that our relationship  has evolved enough that we can be honest that we see other people  yeah except the people youre seeing are in magazines and videos  hey i told you to stay out of my room  and thats not the point if i were dating  shed be just as supportive of me as i am of her  were no longer exhusband and exwife we are friends getting

remember me  what are you doing up so late  thats funny i was about to ask you the same thing  dont tell me you were waiting up for me  this isnt about what i was doing judith  no no  this is about what you were doing until  now  i told you i had a date you said you were fine with it  in theory i was in practice i think we can both see im not  what did you want me to do sit here and do nothing  why not it was good enough for me  you know what you havent changed at all  youre still the same neurotic overbearing control freak i threw out  neurotic maybe overbearing perhaps but you know what  youre not gonna throw me out because i have changed  tonight im leaving you  as it turns out a distinction without a difference  fine alan suit yourself  wheres dad   hes at our house  how come  well we decided we needed a little time apart  isnt that why you got a divorce  its hard to explain jake   do i get any presents this time  no  what happens now you gonna live here   no  are you gonna buy a new house  no  wanna go to mexico with me and uncle charlie   good morning  good morning  wheres alan   well its a long story  youre not gonna believe it  hi i just stopped by to say i told you so  i told you so  oh come on alan if you cant laugh at yourself at least let me do it  what do you want charlie  well  first of all id like to know exactly how you managed  to let your exwife throw you out of my house  because thats the first thing people are gonna ask when i tell this story  she didnt throw me out i left  oh good theres a twist you see thats what makes a good story   leave me alone charlie  oh lighten up  you tried to be friends with the woman who wrecked your life and failed  no damage done just a little personal humiliation  and at this point in your life how would you even notice that   are you finished  did i mention i told you so   twice  counting this one   okay im finished  thank you  now on to new business  currently you and i are sitting in a house that belongs to neither one of us  while your exwife is sitting in the house that belongs to me   you see the paradox  i cant go back there charlie  shes running around having a great time and ive got nothing   youve got me  drop dead  okay now you got nothing  it would be different if judith and i were both dating  true but moot   unless  what unless   its stupid  stupider than this  come on what do you got  well what if you were dating   but im not  but if you looked like you were  oh you mean no no way  im not gonna let you fix me up with one of your bimbo girlfriends  okay forget it  shed have to be really
