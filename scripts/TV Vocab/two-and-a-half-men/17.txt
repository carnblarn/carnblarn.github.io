ambivalent exwife is here   im not ambivalent im exploring  yes mistress   thanks for bringing jake over  well i wanted to give you this anyway   what is it  its the bill from my divorce lawyer   you

be on time with the premiums  boy my shallow empty lifestyle is looking pretty good right about now  okay as long as were on the subject of lawyers and death  my lawyer recommended that i redraft my will and you know what  if i die after you die guess who gets custody of jake   charlie  charlie   me  what about my sister   i never liked your sister  is this the sister i slept with  shut up

sorry you didnt think i was serious did you  i just said that to piss her off  right good one hey  thats not fair  why dont i get to keep the kid when youre dead  if im dead and judith would have to die before me for it to even be an issue  its a contingency plan for a hypothetical worstcase scenario  i know its a long shot but i had the marlins in the world series  dont tell me they dont come in  it never occurred to me that youd want to be a fulltime parent  this isnt about what i want this is about what you want   and you dont want me to have jake  what  nothing  whyd you say my name  get over yourself no one said your name  so whats wrong with me  charlie youre a great uncle youre there for all the fun stuff  i dont think youre up to the hard work of being a fulltime parent to jake   what  nothing  nothing  so if not me then who are you giving him to  im not giving him to anybody hes not a 5pound ham  you know what i mean who gets him in that scenario thing   cousin jerry and his

 my nephew obviously i have no say in the matter  where are you going  alan quite frankly im a little hurt and a little disappointed  so im gonna go make myself a big glass of vodka  and sit and think about things  charlie wait okay how about this  if judith dies and then i die and then jerry and faye die  jake will come and live with you  yeah like im gonna outlive jerry and faye the way i drink
