is cruel  wait that may just be one reason  well maybe my dad can talk my mom into getting back together with greg  enjoy fifth grade kid youre obviously gonna be there for a while  what am i supposed to do alan  i know how much he liked greg  but that cant be the reason for me to keep seeing him  i understand youre not wrong here  im not because i certainly feel wrong  i failed as a wife im failing as a mother  i even blew it as a lesbian  that might have been the problem  youre not a failure were both at fault for the marriage not working  youre a great mother and im sure you would have made a heck of a lesbian  if you just hung in there a little longer  im gonna take jake out so you guys can talk   thank you  thanks charlie   where we going  i gotta trade in my car  why are you trading this car in didnt you just get it  yeah but theres a banging noise thats driving me crazy  i dont hear anything  youre not in my head  hey as long as youre getting rid of it mind if i take it for a little spin  get real  i promise ill go really slow  forget it its not gonna happen  is that a footprint up there  i never should have brought jake into the relationship it was too soon  dont be too hard on yourself  so greg didnt turn out to be the great guy you thought he was gonna be  oh he was a great guy my god alan he took my breath away  our first night together he picked me up and carried me to bed in his arms  well the point is you brought jake into the relationship too soon  greg said i was too demanding i am arent i   i am a demanding angry shrew  hey hey  dont say that that that is not who you are  thats just who youve become  but you know underneath it all  i can still see the frightened neurotic girl  with the minor eating disorder that i fell in love with  oh alan  i dont get it this is exactly like your other car  no its not listen no banging  well i think you should have gotten a cool car like greg  hey do yourself a favor and stop worshiping this dude  theres a guy in your life whos worth looking up to  and modeling yourself after   dad  okay two guys  well i still dont understand why my mom had to break up with greg  it could have been worse she could have married him and then broken up  when i was your age i was already on my third stepfather  and i kind of liked the second one  well how did you feel  how do you think i felt i was pissed off   yeah well so am i  and im not saying you shouldnt be  but you cant blame your mother shes gotta do whats right for her   you understand  i guess  good  the next time you see her give her a big hug  and let her know that theres still one guy whos willing to live with her  okay  wait you blame your mom for everything  thats different my moms satan  come on lets go boat shopping  if im old enough to drive  im old enough to know whats going on with you and mom  youre not old enough to drive  i dont believe that you were carrying her because she twisted her ankle  believe what you want thats my story and im sticking to it  tell him charlie  your parents were about to have sex when we walked in  yeah right
