                hey judith theres the rock star ready for a fun weekend  leave me alone  musicians  alan that child is driving me insane  like father like son huh  really that bad  hes been sullen and uncooperative for days i think he needs to see someone  what you mean like a shrink  no alan i mean like a blacksmith  this is clearly a reaction to our divorce  hes not processing his emotions in a healthy way  and i think therapy could help unblock him   where did you get that  from my therapist  whos working wonders with you  excuse me  whos working wonders with you  all he does is sit in his room and play that damn thing hes isolating alan  that doesnt mean he needs to see a therapist  hes a normal 11yearold kid who happens to be a little grumpy  and im a normal 35yearold mother who is running out of patience  and by patience i mean prozac  wait a minute you cant still be 35 because  hes getting pretty good at that  yeah well get used to it  charlie what are you doing  smoke on the water  okay  its not cute anymore  make him stop  youre the one who bought him the guitar charlie  the bed is vibrating so much up there im no longer necessary  well im sorry my sons interrupted your afternoon debauchery  but i think hes upset about something   whats he upset about  i dont know  i was just giving him a little space before i talked to him  you want me to talk to him  sure and ill finish for you upstairs  this is a fathers job  tell him i just need like 20 minutes  can i come in  it really sounds like youve got your mojo working  but lets try to turn it down now okay  whatd you do that for  because i love you and i dont want that to change  so how was your week  okay  anything i need to know   anything bothering you  no  you sure cause it seems like somethings bothering you  okay you wanna know whats bothering me  yeah  people keep on asking me whats bothering me   okay i wont ask  good   you know when i was your age  oh man  okay forget that   problems at school  no   problems with mom  no  because i understand theres some things a guy doesnt want to   talk with his mom about  like what  well you know girl problems or somebodys picking on you  or youre the only guy in gym class without hair on his testicles  she sobered up on you huh  no im just being a good host and yeah a little bit   man  did you figure out what his problem is  no but we determined mine was lateonset puberty  you were a mexican hairless werent you  did you check to see if hes constipated  his mother and i are going through a divorce  and theres a lot of emotions he hasnt processed  maybe so but theres also a lot of string cheese he hasnt processed  you know judith thinks he needs to see a therapist  why cause its working so good for her  charlie thats uncalled for  come on the kids problem is hes 11  he cant drive he cant drink and his mother picks out all his clothes  be thankful hes not in the garage biting the heads off of chickens  but this isnt like him  trust your first instinct  just give him a little space and probably by this time tomorrow  i will have killed him  not bad but why dont you try fretting the e and the a string together  i like my way  cool  what did you do that for  look im really happy youve taken up an instrument  and ill be even happier when you learn an actual song  but right now lets just take a little pause for the cause  what do you want  nothing i just thought we could hang out  a couple of musicians taking five  just chilling  nothings bothering me  thats cool im not trying to harsh your mellow  i know there are certain things a guy doesnt want to talk to his parents about   like what  i dont know  peer pressure bullies  skipping class to drive to tijuana with the school nurse  im telling you my youngest once ate a whole can of playdoh  stopped her up for two weeks  berta please  finally pooped out an ashtray  thats the day i quit smoking  any luck  the little snothead kicked me out of his room  welcome to the club  yeah but im the cool uncle  and im the uncool dad  dont get defensive you did the best you could  that kid has nothing to complain about  hes never been spanked hes never even been yelled at  and even while my marriage was collapsing he always came first  well im glad youre not defensive  he has a great life he gets everything he wants  i deny him nothing oh my god what have i done to my son  alan i was kidding youre a terrific father   you think so  yes i do  youre right im always too quick to blame myself   yes you are  its his mothers fault  attaboy  would you like me to make you a snack jake  im not hungry  you sure weve got some pizza left from dinner  alan ease up he said hes not hungry  youll eat when you want to right  would you please not talk im trying to watch  this show is stupid  youre right here you pick something  thanks  cool uncle  stupid  stupid  boring  stupid  seen it  stupid  stupid  stupid  really stupid  stupid  dumb  stupid  all right  pick a stupid show and live with it   forget it ill just go to my room  jake wait  nice going cool uncle  now its my fault  let me tell you something between you and your whacko wife  im an oasis of normality around here  are you ever gonna come back upstairs  im still an oasis  morning  morning did your guest leave  no shes sleeping in please do not let me forget again  perhaps you should put a postit note on your penis  yeah but then id have to take down the sign for the yard sale  buddy i made silver dollar pancakes  im not hungry   come on theyre your favorite  i said no  you know what i was thinking  maybe later we could have a jam session you on guitar me on piano  id rather watch cartoons   what is your problem  charlie calm down  im sorry but when i was his age i had to walk five blocks  in the rain to have a jam session  yeah well yelling at him isnt gonna help  i was thinking that maybe the three of us could go out and do something fun today  you want fun  lets take him to the rose bowl swap meet and see what we can get for him  or we could be patient  and maybe eventually hell tell us whats bothering him  wheres my grandson  or we could scare it out of him  granted i dont know what its like to be an 11yearold boy  but i do know one thing sweetheart  you have no idea what real unhappiness is  real unhappiness is being totally ignored  by the very people you gave birth to  real unhappiness is when youre recovering from liposuction  and your only grandson doesnt even send you a getwell card  and fyi i only had that surgery so you wouldnt have a grandmommy  with matronly upper arms  well if he didnt need a shrink before he needs one now  im telling you youre spoiling the kid  i didnt have a shrink when i was jakes age  and my childhood was twice as screwed up as his  i mean youre a little cuckoo judith  but compared to our mother youre like a fart in a hurricane  mom never took you to see dr demerest   you got to see a shrink  just a couple of times  for the night terrors agoraphobia and bedwetting  did it work  i can pee outside in the dark you be the judge  you know charlie if you think im cuckoo  simply because i want to help my child express his feelings  well then i think you have a big problem  so jake how you liking that bean bag chair huh   you comfy  its okay  cause we could sit in the little chairs  you know sometimes i like to sit in a little chair  makes me feel like a giant  hello jake  well i can barely see you from up here  do you sometimes feel like a small insignificant person  in a world full of giants  not really  well maybe thats just me  so anyhow i was hoping we could talk for a little bit  draw some pictures maybe play some games  do you like puppets  not really  neither do i  but sometimes they help  when im in a bad mood  i hope she gets him to talk about the divorce  yeah its a traumatic thing to see his father kicked out of his house  it wasnt exactly healthy for him to see the life being sucked out of his mother  excuse me but that was going on for years and he was still a happy little boy  he stuck in his thumb and pulled out a blank   plum right  it would be nice if you took a little responsibility for jakes problems  shes right charlie   me what did i do  you taught him how to gamble  you brought strange women into the house  you taught him how to curse in italian  your drinking sets a bad example  lets get one thing straight  i taught him how to curse in spanish  okay well jake and i had a wonderful talk  and now id like to speak with the grownups  arent you coming in charlie  no im still trying to find the toothbrush in the tree here  is this uncle charlie  well i definitely want to talk with uncle charlie  thanks a lot  no please make yourselves comfortable  okay well jake and i had a very nice little talk  i invited him to share his feelings with me in a confidential  nonthreatening context  and after hearing everything he had to say  i must tell you very frankly  who am i kidding i got nothing  thats it 150 an hour for i got nothing  its 175 but thats not really the point now is it   what did he tell you  he claims nothings bothering him  he claims theres nothing wrong but when i probed just a little bit  he told me to besa mi culo  you see spanish  i hope youre proud of yourself charlie  hes not a sulky little jerkwad cause he learned a second language   see what my sons been living with  only because she threw me out  what i have a right to be happy  speaking of which did i leave that girl at the house  shut up charlie   dont tell me to shut up  calm down   i dont even know what hes doing here  im trying to keep your kid  from turning into a neurotic basket case like my brother  maybe then he wont marry a messed up woman  im screwed up because youre a lousy brother   my god your whole familys insane  hold on people  even cows know  words can hurt  jake you know that even though your mother and i bicker sometimes  we will always love you no matter what  i know  and honey you also need to know that our splitting up   had absolutely nothing to do with you  i know  its just that mommy has a right to be happy  yeah he knows  and whatevers bothering you  you know i had nothing to do with it right   yeah  see  can i go to bed now  now jake its only 700  im tired  all right honey ill come tuck you in before i leave   okay thats a bad sign  its a symptom of clinical depression  you would know  please if my kids had gone to bed at 700  id have dipped myself in gravy and danced naked on the rooftops  she does make a hell of a gravy   morning uncle charlie  morning  morning dad morning berta   morning  morning  so dad what are we gonna do today  i dont know what would you like to do  i dont know something fun maybe we could jam uncle charlie  great  dad can i eat my cereal down by the tv   sure  thanks  what happened to him  if i didnt know better id swear he got laid last night  i hope you dont mind but i talked to him before he went to sleep last night  what
