discount   what does that mean  it doesnt mean anything   how do you want your venison  does it come with antlers  alan theres no reason your son cant learn from your mistakes  i didnt make a mistake mom  unbelievable twentyfive years later  and he still denies shoplifting  oh i get it fivefinger discount cool  i did not shoplift jake it was a misunderstanding  alan please  walking around a toy store with your brother  and the silly putty just jumped in your pocket  yes  not much of a lie dad  okay everybody ready to order  is that why you wont let me have silly putty  its a stupid pointless toy  but whyd you steal it  i didnt the security guard must have planted it on me to make a bust  oh alan  who in their right mind would plant silly putty on a 9yearold boy  who indeed   hey jake you ever eaten snails  yeah sure  i mean in a restaurant  oh no   you okay  no that deer didnt have antlers  when i ate it but its sure coming out that way  well youll feel better tomorrow  we should sue that restaurant  well ill get right on it come on   dad  yeah  did you ever steal a car  i never stole anything  its okay you could tell me  i already know you got a rap sheet  for the last time i did not take that silly putty  but the experience did teach me a very important lesson  and you know what that was  if you get caught stick to your story no matter how lame it is   no the lesson was  hang on dad  okay go ahead  the lesson was  oh god jake thats thats awful  yeah i wish i could have saved that one for school   you too  yeah  apparently mom wasnt the only parasite at dinner tonight  hey  how much do you remember about the whole silly putty incident  oh gee not too much  i recall you crying when they dragged you into the store managers office  then i went and got a corn dog and an orange julius  boy those were good   remember those  no i mean  did you see me take the silly putty  oh no no i was nowhere near the silly putty  i think i was in the doll section taking a peek under barbies dress  what a gyp that was  if jake had been caught shoplifting and told me the story i told  theres no way id believe him  well lets just hope he doesnt get caught   can i tell you a little secret  okay  i always knew it wasnt the security guard  really  theres only one rational explanation for how the silly putty got in my pants  and what would that be  that i actually stole it but my mind couldnt deal with it  so somehow i blocked it out  the human brain huh you gotta love it  that happens right you do something horrible  and wake up with no recollection  oh yeah  and yet there she is lying right next to you  you know that day changed my life  i mean ever since ive had to be on guard against bad alan  im sorry bad alan  yeah its its what i call my potential for evildoing   oh god  its why ive always worked so hard  to be a good son a good student a good person  and youve succeeded you are good good good  well sure i turned out great but at what cost  i mean do you have any clue how tightly wrapped ive had to be  to keep bad alan in check  i get glimpses  well i suppose i should count my blessings  that i was stopped who knows what kind of monster  i wouldve become if i hadnt been caught with the putty  but what if the security guard did plant it on you  that would mean theres no bad alan  thats true  but i cant afford to take that chance  none of us can  hes fine  hey charlie  hey rose  looks like somebody needs a shoulder to cry on  no thank you  wanna just make out then   rose  youre right that was out of line  i deserve a spanking  okay whats up   can i trust you with something  you trust me  with your bank account number  i never gave you my bank account number  right right go on  have you ever done anything so wrong so horrible  oh yeah   let me finish  im sorry  something that seemed harmless at the time  yet somehow managed to mess up someones entire life  good question  i think its too early to say go on  well i have  twentyfive years ago i put silly putty in my brothers pants  well if you left it in the egg it should still be good  my point is everybody thought he stole it  and i never told him the truth  now youre wracked with guilt  and not sure whether a confession will make things better or worse  yes exactly  thats a sexy feeling isnt it  come on rose  you want my advice charlie  god help me yes  take your secret to the grave  but leave a manuscript explaining every questionable act  youve committed in a safetydeposit box  with instructions for it to be opened at your death  and read in front of all your friends relatives and former lovers  i like it  good  now we can relax and enjoy the evening  sing it with me charlie  three four five six seven   are you decent  yeah  three four five six seven  whats up   nothing just came in to say good night  three four five six seven  why  three four five six seven  nothing you just seemed stressed out before and i was concerned  oh thanks youre a youre a good brother  three four five six seven  you do that every night  are you kidding after every meal  three four five six seven  you are tightly wrapped arent you  the price of healthy gums is eternal vigilance  oh god i cant do this anymore   do what  i have to tell you something   okay  come on out in the bedroom  all right   what you doing  youll understand in a minute   i thought you had to tell me something  i do  there is no bad alan  i stole the silly putty  and put it in your pocket when you werent looking   three four five six seven  damn you to hell  come out here and die like a man  what do you know there is a bad alan  hey dad when you got arrested for shoplifting did they take you to jail  i did not get arrested and there was no jail  so i guess you never had to shank a guy to get your props in the yard  you cracked the parental code on the cable box again  its 1234 a monkey could crack that   good morning  morning  why are you walking like that  i spent the night in the bathroom  you too huh  tell jake what you told me last night  oh okay sure  jake your father didnt steal the silly putty   i did  really  yeah i stuck it in his pocket so if anything happened  hed be the one to get in trouble  what do you think now jake  i think uncle charlies a genius  what no no no genius no no  i mean its the perfect crime how did you think of that  i dont know  i saw the putty your dad was wearing those dorky chinos with the big pockets   and a light just went off in my head  charlie  a bad light a bad evil light because stealing is wrong  and letting somebody else take the blame for it is worse  yeah so dad was like a decoy  well technically the term is mule   mule why  because he carries stuff   oh of course  okay okay  the important thing is your father never stole in his life  and your uncle charlie is a thief and a coward  yeah but youre a mule  are you happy go get dressed and washed   can we go to the mall  why do you wa no  i need to get a different mule  okay can we please get past this  no no we cant  i feel betrayed and hurt in ways that i cant even express  and you think we can just dance past that  i was hoping  well i am sorry but it is not that easy  i mean thanks to you my my life has been twisted beyond recognition  i mean look at me charlie  im a im a broke hopelessly neurotic middleaged man  who doesnt know who he is or where he belongs  i have nothing charlie   no no wife no home nothing  okay  so should i check back with you after lunch  what do you want me to do  i said i was sorry l i confessed to jake  and i doubt i got more than six seven hours sleep last night  nothing you can do the damage has been done   it cant be undone  come on im your brother   youre gonna forgive you always do  no no this is different   this is the worst thing youve ever done  no its not  what do you mean  just making conversation   hey mom  charlie what are you doing here   in the neighborhood thought id visit  why   i dont know im your son  and   and i was hoping we could talk  about  may i please just come in  are you fleeing from the law   im not fleeing from anyone mom  well keep it in mind  no one would ever think to look for you at your mothers house   i get your point i dont visit enough  you dont visit at all  and im riddled with guilt  oh youre just saying that to make me feel better  so whats up  you know how the other night at dinner  we were talking about the silly putty deal  did that venison disagree with you  yeah thats not what i came to talk about  ive got a good mind to sue that restaurant   yeah anyway about the silly putty  what about it  alan didnt steal it i did  i put it in his pocket  you framed your baby brother  how could you  i know i know it was a rotten thing to do  rotten its unspeakable  do you have any idea what you put me through   you  first the embarrassment  of people thinking that id spawned a petty thief  then all the trouble i went to trying to figure out clever ways  to hide my jewelry from his sticky little fingers   thats really not what l  not to mention the hundreds of hours  spent driving him to therapy with that creepy dr demerest  while i could have been i dont know doing something fun  okay yeah it was a real imposition on you  and as it turns out it had kind of a negative impact on alan too  alan oh yes of course  you know there was no insurance for kleptomania therapy in those days  it was all out of pocket  yeah but about alan  i was hoping you might have insight as to how i could get him to forgive me  why ask me  you know im starting to wonder that myself  i guess its because he still loves you  despite all the lousy stuff you did to him  i beg your pardon i was a wonderful mother  and if alan thinks otherwise  its only because that walleyed dr demerest put ideas into his head  well that was money well spent  okay then  i didnt need a reason to drink tonight but its nice to know ive got one  hey charlie wait   what  have you forgotten why you came here  you want forgiveness right   yes  well  i forgive you  but next time call first  would you pass the salt  could you get me the salt   dad salt  sure   here  thanks  oh would you give me the ketchup please  here heres the ketchup  thank you   dad  yeah  if uncle charlie let you kick him in the nuts  would that make you guys even  no  boy hes really mad at you  relax jake were just having a little communication problem  thats what dad said right before mom threw him out  nobody threw me out  your mother and i mutually decided that we werent compatible  you dont seem compatible with uncle charlie right now   well its not my fault  was it your fault with mom  no  you know dad maybe youre the one whos not compatible  if youre done with dinner do your homework  fine kill the messenger   oh come on alan talk to me  no  look i wanna make this right but you gotta help me  please tell me what i can do im begging for your forgiveness  i am sorry but you did something  which affected my life in a deeply destructive way and  l i dont think i have it in me to forgive you   hello anybody home  in here mom  well how are my boys doing this evening  well i think mommy has the answer alan  if you find it intolerable living under the same roof  with the brother who betrayed you  then you and jake can come and live with me  were good  hey charlie a couple of days ago  you said the silly putty wasnt the worst thing you ever did to me  its ancient history let it go  i know i know its just im curious  what else have you done to me that i didnt know about   its not important  yes it is  the truth about the shoplifting incident  its allowed me to reevaluate who i am  and and feel better about myself   well thats great  yeah  i feel a lot better since i confessed  good good so lets keep going with this  okay but you gotta promise that no matter what i tell you all is forgiven  oh absolutely absolutely  youre probably gonna laugh   im sure i will tell me  well  remember how you were a bed wetter till you were 8  yeah  you actually stopped at 6  wha what what did you do did you sneak into my room and  and and pour warm water on me while i was asleep  yeah okay lets say it was water and lets say i poured it  well i feel better how about you
