musician youre a salesman you know what you sell  crap  grannys big fudge nuggets maple loops  hey maple loops is part of a nutritious balanced breakfast  yeah if you eat it with a steak and some broccoli  and let me tell you another thing you had a shot at a real career  you couldve played in great bands  you couldve been a respected studio musician  dont you think i wanted that  i tried alan and i failed  the truth is if i hadnt started writing jingles id be playing  faculty mixers at the guadalajara medical school  since youre being honest i guess i can admit  i didnt really get into guadalajara  i guess neither of us is doing exactly what we dreamed about when we were kids  i guess not  but you know we could be doing a lot worse  yes we could  excuse me  you know whats nice though  this right now  taking care of each other like we did when we were kids  well no one else was gonna take care of us   we were on our own  yeah  dad was gone and mom was  what are you doing hey
