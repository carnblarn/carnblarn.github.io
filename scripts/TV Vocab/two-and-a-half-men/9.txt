 i mean hes a great kid but whos got the energy  and your mother shes been calling me all week  she wants to go to a spinning class with me what is up with that  i thought you two hit it off  im from the midwest i was being polite  what did you think was going on  that   so no hard feelings  no of course not  so you and dave how serious is that  goodbye charlie  you know youre breaking a little boys heart  you see my relationships with women they come and go  but you and me were family  thats solid thats forever you with me  i think so  maybe i shouldnt be laying this on you because youre 10  but im beginning to realize  i might not be the guy i thought everybody thought i was  yeah its a mind blower isnt it  you see the problem isnt with who i go out with  the problem is with me  your uncle charlie has major trust issues with women  and i think it might have something to do with my relationship with my mom  i understand  do you  no im just tired and i dont care anymore  so were cool   yeah  good   good night  good night   uncle charlie  yeah  does this mean you dont have nuts like a fox  yeah  thats what it means  dont look at my tiles alan  scrabble eyes my sweet patootie hes a tile peeker  rose listen i think i owe you an apology  you mean for seducing me with your roguish charms  and then dumping me like a bag of old doorknobs  that and more recently  i told alan that you were being nice to him just to get close to me  and ive come to realize thats my own paranoia about women  trying to manipulate me and im sorry that i projected that on you  come here you big silly   i forgive you  really  thank you  okay i gotta go your brother is out of control with that egg timer  you think maybe i could play with you guys  its fine with me go ask mr thatsnotaword
