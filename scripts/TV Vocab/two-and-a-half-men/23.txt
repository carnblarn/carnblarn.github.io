me alone   whos that  judith again  shes really upset with me   man im sorry  thank you  now get out  get out shes upset with me because of you  thats different  but still get out  your sexist manipulative attitude towards women just got into jakes head  and he spewed it out in front of his mothers angry womens support group  wait a minute is it a womens support group thats angry  or a support group just for angry women  what difference does it make  if they are already angry then im less culpable  okay what did jake say  not much he just parroted your line about how women are only good for sex  and cleaning the house  charlie you didnt really say that  no  what i said was is that there is really no reason to get married  if youve already got somebody to clean and  you want to go to the movies with me  man jakes going to love this video game  listen to this sixteen levels of ultrarealistic murder and mayhem  twentyfour fleshripping weapons  plus gratuitous nudity   let me see that   scooters magic tree fort  scooters a zombie  its tiffany  she still talking to you after last weekend  what can i tell you i am hard to stay mad at  hello hey tiff ive been thinking about you all week  yeah we did get off to a bad start and i really blame myself  no id love to try again  im going to go get jake  but ill leave the front door unlocked in case satan shows up to collect your soul  wait a minute alan i gotta put you on hold a sec tiff  how come judiths not bringing him over  i dont know judith asked me to do it and i just got tired of arguing  she still busting your chops about what jake said  look blame it on me   tell her im sorry  she wont buy it  sure she will women are suckers for a good apology  just keep shoveling it on till roses start growing in it  poor satan hell come for your soul and hell leave emptyhanded  hey tiff im back  thats kind of harsh  wait a minute hello  i see thats not the hold button   hey is jake ready  not exactly  maybe you should come in for a second  judith how many times have i asked you to have him ready when i  hello   sit down alan we want to talk to you  we  yes sit down  okay  i guess i can stay for a minute   no cookies  no cookies   alan jake is not here  why not where is he   hes sleeping over at a friends  what are you talking about  this is my time with him   yes i know but  judith feels she can no longer  allow her son to be exposed to the toxic influence of your brother  wait a second we have a custody agreement  yes but judith feels that the welfare of her son supersedes that   you cant do this  yes she can   who are you  they are my friends  wait what the hell do your friends have to do with this   we love and support her  and we wont let you bully her  wait okay first of all can the person i talk to be the person who answers me  thats fair  okay i dont want to talk to you people this is between me and judith  youre absolutely right judith tell him what we agreed  okay you can see jake on weekends but not at charlies house  but thats where i live  im sorry alan but youre just going to have to choose  between your son and your brother  you know what maybe i have a problem with jake being in this toxic environment  and i am not leaving until you bitter old crones are out of my house  and i have my kid back  all right you can stay but i want my kid  okay i will go   morning  hey   where are the pancakes  what pancakes  you always make pancakes on saturday morning  i make them for jake jakes not here   kind of weird without him huh  yes  would it lift your spirits if you made pancakes for me  im sorry man i told you to blame it all on me  charlie they had moved way past blame  it was more like a jihad  except with no cookies  your big mistake was dealing with them as a group  the trick with women is to split them off from the herd one by one  otherwise they spook and you risk a stampede  kind of like buffalo  in fact i will bet thats where that song comes from  buffalo gals wont you come out tonight come out tonight  do you hear yourself buffalo gals are you insane  this is the kind of talk that started this whole mess  i didnt write the song alan   morning  morning berta   what no pancakes  jakes not here this weekend  why not  apparently jake took something i said out of context  and repeated it in front of his mother and she overreacted as is her nature  what did you say numbnuts  all i said was if your domestic chores are taken care of by one woman  and you have an active sexual life with other women  you dont necessarily need yet another woman  with whom to tie the matrimonial knot  and which category do i come in under  i got to say its the sweet loving berta because this place is a mess  morning everybody i brought real maple syrup for the pancakes   theres no pancakes rose  because jakes not here  because charlies an idiot  why i mean why is jake not here not why is charlie an idiot  because we know that  hello wheres my grandson  oh god make this stop  good morning all   hi mom  morning   so wheres jake  ask charlie   yeah ask him  charlie  see just like buffalo  no evelyn i am sorry  i want you to be able to spend time with your grandson  but i just dont want him around charlie  why why do you think  thats right  no his attitude toward women is not a reflection on you or how you raised him  yes it is  look theres someone at the door ive got to go  no evelyn i dont think this would seem less important if i was getting a little    judith cant we talk about this  theres nothing to talk about charlie  okay dont talk just listen  i love jake and i would never intentionally do anything   to influence him in a negative way  i dont care about your intentions  okay i am a jerk i am immature i am selfcentered i am  hi im charlie  yes weve heard about you  and i will bet none of its good   i am sorry what is your name  linda  linda really  i once had my heart broken by a woman named linda  charlie we are having a meeting  and ill bet it was about me   am i right come on be honest  mandy  mandy i love that song mandy  listen i know i cant come in here and ask to be forgiven  for some of the stupid things i have said in front of jake  but i do have the right to say i am sorry dont i  i suppose   thank you and you are  kathleen  kathleen a fine irish name  halfirish on my mothers side   are you and your mom close  yeah i guess  i envy that kathleen   me and my mom  okay charlie give it a rest  we are not a bunch of sorority girls you can charm with your big brown eyes  and nice smile  thank you mandy  linda i admit i sometimes relate to women on a very superficial level  but i think thats because  deep down i have intimacy issues that probably go back to my mom  my mother crippled me emotionally  you too  and i am so afraid im making the same mistakes with my daughter   you know what  ruth  thats the same fear i have with jake ruth  ive clearly made mistakes but thats because im human  and after all whatre we trying to do with our children  other than to raise them as humans  stop it charlie our children you have no children  thats true although i dont think its fair to throw it in my face  i mean some of us havent been blessed with the little ones the way you have  that was uncalled for judith  look im being real upfront with you about the mistakes ive made with jake  how ive influenced him  but lets talk for a minute about how hes influenced me  how this little boy has made me a better man  dear god you are not going to listen to this crap are you  no i will not  hes lying to you thats all he does lie youve got to believe me  its okay its all right judith we are all here for you  okay whos ready for a refill  that kid  what are you going to do huh  charlie wheres the little girls room  its down the hall to the right and around here we leave the seat up  so dont just drop trou and back in   you are terrible  im serious  im not coming in there with the shoehorn  you are getting a little pink there kathy  turn around ill put some more suntan lotion on your back  okay   hi alan  hello   you have a lovely home  thank you  whats happening  a bunch of us came over to have wine in gods room why dont you join us  thank you  what the hell  buffalo gals wont you come out tonight  come out tonight come out tonight  buffalo gals wont you come out tonight  and dance

till tiffany gets here  what  you got a normalsized head  thanks i am pretty happy with it   i dont get it  what dont you get  i heard mom say the reason uncle charlie gets into so much trouble  is because he thinks with his little head  its not that little   okay you tell your mother  charlie  that women are to be honored and respected  see jake thats the big head talking  but he only has one head  you want to tell him or should we let him spin for a while  id rather he spin  come on at least give me a clue  all right  what do men have that women dont  beards   lower  beards  youre right let him spin  english
