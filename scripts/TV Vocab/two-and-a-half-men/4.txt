is your favorite part  gee id have to say finding out you live just two doors down  sometimes its all i can do not to chew through that house in the middle  yeah  but see im not looking for a relationship right now  so maybe you should find someone who can give you the attention you want  need deserve  require  are you saying we should see other people  yes thats exactly what im saying  you have so much love to give and somewhere out there is a guy who  can take it   well there is this one guy  he sounds perfect  his name is andy he works at jamba juice  he always gives me a free wheatgrass shooter and chuckles when i gag  then ask him out  that seems kind of forward dont you think  no come on women ask guys out all the time  what they dont do is handcuff themselves  to the refrigerator when he says its time to go home  thats where you and i went off the track isnt it  im the past andys the future  byebye now good luck  andy  alan   what did you do to my piano  nothing i
