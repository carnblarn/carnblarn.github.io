                 hi  hi uncle charlie  how was your game  the musicians softball league is a joke  guys trying to catch stuff that isnt there  people throwing up on an easy double play ball  so why do you go  there is an open bar and they let me pitch  ive got to get dressed  i was going to throw this toast out but its yours if you want it  when did i become the family dog   jake whats this a phone message  yeah some lady called for you  who i cant read your writing  youre a big selfish jerk   okay i know who this is amy   probably amy  yup amy   she wants you to call her back  yeah thatll happen   why not  because i never said id call her back  remember this jake  never make promises to women that you dont intend to keep   and you know how you do that  always keep my promises  that might work  a better way is never make promises   what happens if amy calls again  okay im glad you asked that  when the phone rings at uncle charlies house  we dont just willynilly pick up the receiver and answer it no  what we do is we check the caller id  and only pick up if we want to talk to that person   like mom  that depends  your mom yes my mom no  how come you dont want to talk to your mom  ill tell you all about that when you are old enough to drink  what if i want to talk to your mom  okay that kind of attitude is going to break down the whole system   dad no dont pick up the phone  why not  it might be your mom or a woman  its amy again she just wont give up  charlie  look i appreciate your need for privacy but i think youre sending a bad message  to my son about how to deal with women  how so  he thinks its okay to avoid somebody because  the conversation might be uncomfortable  charlie  okay thats not funny  look if i am teaching the kid anything its honesty  really walk me through the lesson charlie educate me  okay i tell women upfront im not looking for a longterm relationship  if they dont believe me or theyre determined to change my mind  i have a right to avoid that conversation  and the phone company obviously agrees with me  otherwise they wouldnt have invented caller id  uncle charlie  what if somebody you dont want to talk to comes over instead of calls   just tell them im not here  hes not here grandma  mom you just surprised me   you should have called first  charlie i call constantly  you screen like an olympic drug tester  im happy to see you mom  i dont believe you sweetheart but at least you care enough to lie  i care enough to lie you just caught me off guard  so what are you doing here  im showing a house up the beach

very important to me we are going to have a nice dinner  youre going to be charming and tommy will remain oblivious  to the fact that you defiled his daughter  she wasnt exactly filed when i met her  you dont know how lucky you are to have a mother like evelyn  she is the warmest most affectionate giving woman i have ever known  thats my mom  call her evelyn thats the game  you play your game ill play mine   here we are  theres my little karaoke cupcake  tommy you are not telling that story  we took one of those little cruises to alaska  glaciers and whales i didnt quite see the point of it all  but during the evening there was this karaoke competition  and as you know im no stranger to the stage  yes mom i know  excuse me  anyway you know how i have always sung  these boots are made for walking with my little dance routine  yes mom i have it on my wedding video   so howve you been  you know  no i dont know charlie  when people dont return your calls its kind of hard to know how they have been  look i know this is an awkward coincidence  its no coincidence  when my father told me who he was dating i made a point of being here  you cant argue the awkward part right  so i am zipping up my boots and i am about to go onstage  when this hausfrau from tonedeaf texas gets up and starts singing my song  i think you can imagine how unhappy i was  dont tell me to calm down you lied to me  i did not lie to you and you could have told me this on the phone   you never answer your phone  of course not  who wants to have this conversation  so i sidled up to the woman and  really very smoothly turned it in to a duet  when suddenly she starts pushing me   you said i was very special to you  you were   yeah me and three other women  i said you were special not unique  drop dead you bastard  excuse me  in my defense  screw it  finish the story evelyn did you push her back  stupid musicians league  i dont know why i bother get this tie score we are down to our last out  our best hitter billy kreskys up  the bases are loaded and so is kresky  his whole family is standing behind the backstop crying and pleading  go back to rehab daddy we love you  needless to say he choked  charlie i think we have got a bigger problem   our mother is missing  dont try to cheer me up  i am serious i called her home her car her cell nothing  did you check with the captain of the flying monkeys  charlie  shes probably just sulking because i screwed up her dinner party last week  thats what i thought too except i called her office and they havent heard from her   okay thats weird  yeah  i think somebody needs to go over there and make sure shes okay  good idea you do that and ill stay here in case she calls  why dont you go and i will stay here in case she calls  no i got to be honest i like my idea better   im not going there alone  im not going at all  what do you want to bet she ran off to vegas to marry this tommy guy  if thats all this is great  the only down side would be that you slept with our stepsister  hadnt thought of that kinda sexy   kinda sick  im saying  look there is no one here lets go  no i want to take a look   you have a key  im the good son  mom  okay shes not here lets go  okay shes here lets go  charlie  mom are you all right why havent you been answering the phone  i didnt want to burden anyone with my grief over the late tommy pearson  tommy died  he is dead to me   okay what happened  he dumped me  mom i am sorry  the thing between me and his daughter happened years before you met the guy  this has nothing to do with you charlie  god youre a narcissist  no tommy left me for some freshfaced  i am sorry mom i know he meant a lot to you  yeah im sorry too  thank you alan nice try charlie  now if you will both please leave id like

sometimes i find cool stuff on the beach  thats nice but you know that cool stuff  is stuff that other people lost and will never get back  trinkets and treasures buried beneath the lonely sands of time   yeah but finders keepers right  and losers weepers   hes getting killed out there  its all right hes not crying yet  somebody needs to go out there and back him up  10 says its not me  whats going on with you  the kids got a bladder the size of a pea  you were a bed wetter if i recall  you know what jake would really get a kick out of  if you could sing while charlie played the piano  no alan i couldnt   besides charlie always hated that  are you kidding it was his idea  pick it up charlie we are walking not crawling  are you ready boots start walking    okay now  one more time  mom

towards the end there  sorry i always get a little carried away when you do the james brown medley  charlie  your mothers a real sad case isnt she  youll get over him theres other guys  he never even called never even said goodbye  maybe he was scared  of what  i knew there were no promises no strings  that doesnt mean there cant be common courtesy  to think i mean that little to him  it will be okay mom  you still got me and alan  charlie please i know how difficult things are between us  maybe its my fault  its not all your fault  i probably havent been the best son  i just want you to know
