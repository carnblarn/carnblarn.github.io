supposed to mean  mom how much do you know about bill  charlie i have no doubt that you two shared  some sordid adventures together but thats the past  the only thing that matters to me now is  that bill is a handsome sensitive wonderful man  excuse me  nothing im just happy to be here  frankly mom im a little uncomfortable with this  a little i think im having a stroke  i knew it you hypocrites  its perfectly all right for you to date younger women  but when a mature woman gets involved with a younger man  somehow its scandalous and immoral   no mom its not the age  well what then  because hes your friend  i didnt object when you dated that friend of mine   you what  one time  i was 19 and she was a very doable 42  and if you heard how she talked about you you wouldnt call her a friend  ive heard enough im going to continue to see bill  and if you dont like it thats just too bad  wait mom i thought you came here so that we could discuss it  please i came here to brag i just needed an opening line   wow she doesnt know  someones going to have to tell her   charlie  what  ill clean your house free for a month if you let me do it  come on it is a little funny  when we were dating you never wanted me to meet your mom  all right maybe not so much funny as ironic   look jill bill  youre angry with me  not angry not thrilled  charlie i never planned for this to happen  i mean your mom and i just hit it off  she beautiful intelligent selfassured  and shes just exploding with this raw sexuality  no listen fella  i dont know what they told you in orientation  but rule number 1 when a
