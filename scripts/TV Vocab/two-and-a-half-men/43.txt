youre the reason we went to the eye doctor in the first place  you said throw me a piece of toast  i threw you a piece of toast  two cups of regular coffee please   my treat  oh that makes up for everything  pigeons can feed out of my eye socket but i get a free cup of coffee  just the coffee keep the change  im gonna need your help until i get this patch off  i am absolutely there for you

whos here  who  a girl i used to go out with over there  hey sherri   hey charlie long time  yeah good to see you   this is my brother alan  hi   hi  what happened to your eye  well i wanted a piece of toast and  bar fight   nice to meet you  well nice meeting you too   good to see you charlie  good to see you too   wow you went out with her  yep  why would you stop  i dont remember i probably got bored  bored how do you get bored with that  for every beautiful woman theres at least one guy out there  whos tired of pretending to listen to her in exchange for sex  well let me go on record as saying i am not that guy  if i ever had a woman like that i would cherish her  i would worship her i would  start a small country and put her face on a stamp so i could lick her head   why dont you go talk to her  yeah right  gorgeous women like that are not interested in pasty guys like me  unless were in line for the british throne   so you give up without even trying  yep thats my motto  why waste time on 10s when youre already getting rejected by sixes  alan listen to me you are a smart sensitive goodiooking man  with some milky discharge coming out of one eye  but who amongst us is perfect  thats the other thing look at me im a mess  so women like sherri have big hunky guys hitting on them all day long  a guy like you walks up makes a move you know what that says to her  trick or treat  it says im confident in who i am   you think  i know  so what if shes not interested whats the worst that could happen  actually the worst that could happen is she points at me  and laughs causing every seventh grader in the cafeteria to turn  and watch me slink back to the geek table  with a growing wet spot on the front of my chinos  we ninth graders enjoyed it also  but youre not in junior high anymore and youre not a  youre not in junior high anymore   its time to let go of those fears  i dont know  oh come on alan  for once in your life dont settle go for what you really want  you know what youre right im gonna go talk to her  hold on  lets clean some of that discharge  you wanna say im confident not im infectious  there go get her  hey you see that guy over there twenty bucks says he wets himself   hello  hi   alan  i remember  look i needed to come clean about something  i wasnt actually in a bar fight  i took a piece of wholewheat toast to the eye  i mean it was cut diagonally and toasted well  so it was essentially shrapnel  did some real damage  i see and why do you feel the need to tell me all this  well i guess i didnt want our relationship to start on a lie  our relationship   ill go now  no no wait  sit down join me  okay   thats it im out  oh come on  no no no no more  you got a date leave it alone  not just a date a date with  enough   id think youd be happy for me  i am happy for you  you had the courage to walk over  with your pusfilled eye and fall on your ass  and still got a date with one of the most beautiful women ive ever met   im not only happy for you im proud  thank you  now i have to reevaluate everything i thought i knew  about men women relationships god and the universe  but thats not your problem  charlie i am as surprised as you that she said yes  i dont think so  i was really intimidated but as it turns out shes just like a regular person  except for you know being from the planet  alan never do that around me again  you know actually we have a lot in common  okay ill bite  well we both went through tough divorces   sherri was married  you didnt know that   it never came up  what did come up  never mind scratch that  where should i take her to dinner  where did you go so i can take her somewhere else  last thing you want is for her to start comparing you to me  exactly  wait  what do you mean  you want your relationship to stand on its own   right  well thats what i meant  okay i thought you were trying to rub my nose in the fact that you dated her  alan i would never do that  well thank you  i dont have to  you think you could kill a guy with a piece of toast  no  because if you did you could eat the toast  the police would never find the weapon its the perfect crime  and part of a nutritious breakfast  okay guys i guess ill see you later  where you going   out for dinner  with who  jake look i think  i think youre old enough to know that your dads not just a dad  hes also a man and that  even though im not married to your mom  i still enjoy the company of women  which means that i will occasionally go out with one  but the important thing for you to understand  is that i am not trying to replace your mother  in fact no one can replace your mother  i bet you could kill a guy with a piece of bacon  all right then im glad we had this talk  im gonna go post my plan on the internet  you know theres moments around here  that make me wish i had a son of my own  that wasnt one of them  yeah well anyway i really appreciate you watching him tonight  no problem   how you getting to the restaurant  sherris picking me up   very convenient  why  because shes been here before been here with you  because youve had sex with her in every room in the house  no because you cant drive  but its interesting to see how your mind works  alan let me give you some advice  alcohol impairs your ability to make good decisions  we dont want you to lose that ability we want her to  of course very good  what else  well women like sherri already know theyre beautiful and desirable   you wont score points by telling her  okay  dont be in a hurry to spill your guts  she doesnt need your life story  before you get the salad  got it  as someone who knows your life story id say she doesnt need to hear it at all  right right ill be cool aloof distant  shes here shes here shes here  what about the what what  what about the kiss goodnight   should i ask or just go for it  go for it  dont wait until the last minute it creates pressure   get it out of the way early  how early  after dinner when you walk to the car  open her door wait for her to say thank you  smile lean in and kiss her  oh nice  hi alan you ready  youre the most beautiful woman ive ever seen and i dont deserve you  thats another way to go   madam  thank you   sir  oh thank you   would you like the wine list  no  ill have the woodbridge pinot noir or should we get a bottle  oh definitely get a bottle  coffee

very cute  you too  all right so tell me about yourself  well theres not a lot to tell  i was san fernando valley chiropractor of the year  if you follow that kind of thing  recently divorced  but not too recently ive already had my rebound transitional relationships   so no worries there  good to know  actually it wasnt so much a relationship  as a case of mistaken identity but i think it still counts   okay  and  as you know i live with charlie  whom youve already   met  yeah lets go with met  alan is my having dated charlie gonna be a problem for you  no no no a little  okay look charlie and l  we had a very brief superficial relationship  okay and to be honest it was mostly about sex  great  my point is yeah im tired of those those shallow relationships  i was having with guys like charlie  i wanna be with a man who can be sensitive and caring nurturing  you know somebody who can make me laugh make me think  you do realize im straight right   see you really are adorable  thank you  i tend to bring out the mothering instinct in women   oh really  ironically not my mother  what the hell are you doing  check it out ninja death toast  okay stop it stop it  youre in no position to give orders mr harper   morning  morning   death toast  oh thank you   so how did it go last night  fine  thats it fine  charlie were not in high school anymore im not gonna go into detail   okay dont tell me  jake go watch tv   im still hungry  theres bread all over the living room  all right   well  it went great  she said im adorable she thinks im nurturing caring and sensitive   im exactly what shes looking for  shes looking for a halfblind sheepdog  she invited me to her house for dinner tonight   i think she wants to have sex  with who   with me  with you  hang on a second  nope no snowballs reported in hell  no sightings of flying pigs   what am i gonna do  you dont know  come on alan you were married for 12 years  what does marriage have to do with sex  point taken okay you want some tips  no no nothing like that  i need stepbystep instructions  all right since this is your first bout in this weight class  id say stick with the basics  better to do the simple stuff well than the fancy stuff badly  got it and the simple stuff would be  well you know how women like you to go slow  really my exwife put a premium on brevity  her motto was  less is more and none is perfect  well sherris not like that youre gonna wanna take your time   i can do that  but dont loiter either  you dont want her to get bored and play solitaire on your head  no loitering got it   something else  okay  when youre with a woman like sherri whos so goshdarn beautiful  that you get excited just thinking about her  how do you keep the sprinklers from going off while youre still mowing  let me make sure i understand  you wanna keep your toothpaste in the tube until youre done brushing  what are you talking about   what are you talking about  okay okay let me try again  i dont wanna frost the cake while im still mixing the batter  i dont get it she must have lost a bet   excuse me  nothing  all right heres what you do  when you feel like the train is leaving the station  you mean going in the tunnel  no no i mean leaving the station  but you have to leave the station to get to the tunnel  okay okay  lets start from the top  and work our way down right  you know what just shut up and listen  when youre making love the way to slow yourself down is  to think of something completely nonsexual   well what do you think of  you  that was a really great dinner  im glad you enjoyed it you ready for dessert  ive been ready since i was 14  ill be back why dont you put some music on  okay  hey how about diana krall  oh actually thats your brothers cd do you mind bringing it back to him  not at all  i think i have one of his tshirts you might as well take that too  no problem  hey this is a cool little cd player  oh thanks it was a gift from your it was a gift  perfect  is there anything else charlie left behind  just me  my brothers a fool  no argument here   that is a very effective neglige  thank you   was it a gift  no   as a matter of fact i bought it myself  oh good   how long ago  what  well i was just wondering if charlie saw it  alan dont go there  oh i wasnt going anywhere its just that   nothing more kissing  okay okay  what exactly is bothering you  well its kind of hard to explain  for example once when charlie and i were at camp  i lost my swim trunks and i had to wear an old pair of charlies and  i just couldnt enjoy the pool at all  so what are you saying im a pair of used swim trunks  no no in this case i think you would be the pool  maybe this was a bad idea  no no its a great idea its right up there  with the wheel fire and refrigerators that give ice through the door   sorry i dont wanna do this anymore  what why  you cant be with me without it being some competition with your brother  its not a competition  and even it was shouldnt we do it first before you decide who wins  you are unbelievable   that could be taken a couple of ways  get out  well no ambiguity there  dont forget your brothers cd  my eye  man i love sunsets  the way the sky is streaked with color its amazing  its the pollution that makes those pretty colors you know  what youre enjoying is the effect of light passing through airborne poison  no thats not what im really enjoying  boy i hope thats guacamole
