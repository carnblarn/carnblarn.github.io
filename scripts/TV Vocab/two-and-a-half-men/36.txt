youre still single  well  its not that hard to believe  im a selfish promiscuous commitmentphobic man  alan on the other hand is a very generous loyal onewoman kind of guy  guilty  why doesnt that surprise me  now what is surprising  is to hear a man be so honest and forthcoming about his flaws  charlie you are a real breath of fresh air  guilty  but if you really want a breath of fresh air take a lungful of alan  he is a true gentleman  oh alans always been a gentleman  i remember one time we were kids we were in my bedroom playing stratego  and my blouse came unbuttoned and alan instead of sneaking a peek  like a lot of guys would do averted his eyes and said jamie bosom  really is that true alan  pretty much we were playing boggle not stratego  well there you go a gentleman a better man than i  oh dont put yourself down charlie you seem like a wonderful man to me  yeah but you heard him im better  excuse me  ill be right back i think he wants to talk  you know you are such a good brother  you have no idea  bosom  forget that what the hell are you doing  what im trying to make you look good turns out its not that easy  you look like youre trying to make me look good

tell you something about my brother  he puts himself down but he is truly a wonderful man  i mean heres a guy single goodiooking talented   well l  youre too modest  talented a ton of money  and what does he do when his brother and nephew need a place to live  does he complain about us cramping his style no  he opens up his home and his heart  and frankly i dont know which one is bigger  you are an incredible human being  can we get the damn check please  wait till you meet jake hes a great kid  youre gonna love him right charlie  dont oversell him alan he mostly sits around and eats  what do

be busy  i was i went to a movie shot some pool  bought a book bought a shirt drank a bucket of coffee read the book  and then it occurred to me hey i have a home  hey dad can you microwave some popcorn for me   why cant you make it for yourself  remember what happened last time  youre old enough to make popcorn without starting a fire  okay ill give it a shot  ill be right back  so jakes a great kid isnt he  yeah i suppose  i would never say this to alan but i dont really care much for children  well the truth is alans not too fond of him either  he feeds the kid and keeps a roof over his head  but theres no love lost between them   charlie give it a rest  sorry  why do you push me towards alan  when its obvious how much you want me  hes got a birthday coming up  just tell me you want me  go ahead charlie tell her  what no no you two with the dungeons the dragons the boggle  you should be together  clearly she wants you so lets be grownup and ill get out of the way  so the two pretty people can mate  no no no no you laid the foundation  and you should you know lay the rest of it  i appreciate what youre trying to do but i am stepping aside   no no im stepping aside  no no i am  no no ill step aside i will clear the way  will you both just shut up youre ruining everything   nice going  nice going   say it charlie  say what  say that slick cool charlie harper finally wants eckelberry hound   you knew about that name  that name scarred me for life  its the reason i havent eaten a carbohydrate since college   well you do look good  youre damn right i look good  you smug shallow son of a bitch  i have spent years working and sweating and dreaming  about the day that i would be able to rub your smarmy nose in it  okay im getting mixed signals here  this is the signal charlie you cant have this  not now not ever never never never  you know i didnt make up the eckelberry hound thing  but he did spread it around i was always your friend  oh please i spent years throwing myself at you friend  playing stupid nerd games on my bed with my shirt open buddy  hoping that you would kiss me or touch me  or at least notice me as a woman pal   you knew your shirt was open  who do you think opened it  but i wasnt pretty enough for you you wanted donna demarco  or maxine chernikoff just because they had big boobs  and no excess facial hair  oh yeah donna demarco old double d  jamie i had no idea i am so sorry  but i was a stupid teenager i guess i just didnt appreciate you then  i guess not  but that was a long time ago im not a stupid teenager anymore  do you think maybe you could forgive me and maybe we could try again  is that what you really want alan  very much  well eat your heart out  you can never have this never never never  well i guess we know why shes still single  youre right dad this is fun  told you it just takes a little while to get the hang of it  see if i can bring it in for a landing  probably not a good idea theres no real place to put it  what do you think donna demarcos doing these days
