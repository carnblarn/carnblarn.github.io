 i took jake out to dinner   youre pretending not to understand me  right  and all i did was suggest to judith  that she might wanna pay a little more attention to her sons ear hygiene  not only was she completely unappreciative  but she had the nerve to denigrate how i raised my sons  yeah because we turned out so well  excuse me but whatever emotional issues you think you have  i kept your ears spotless  i remember you used the same super soaker  to keep us off the furniture  ladies and gentlemen  presenting noted scholar and astudent jake harper   you got an a  i got an a   all right way to

them out like rubella vaccinations  i dont know it looks like a pretty hard test to me   no it was easy  thats because you studied   you earned that a  wendy chow got an aplus  you hear that wendy chow got an aplus  wendy chow is a freak of nature  she cloned a goldfish for the science fair  we cant compare jake to her  who should we compare him to then the paste eaters and the unibrows  darling if you set the bar low in childhood  he may never reach the heights hes capable of  youre condemning him to a life of failure and mediocrity  is that what you want jake a life of failure and mediocrity  no  you see he may well be sharper than you give him credit for  im gonna go to my room  i am putting that apaper up on the fridge  wow texas used to be a separate country  why did we change that  not now charlie how dare you   excuse me  he worked hard on that test  he was finally feeling good about himself and his abilities  and in 30 seconds you managed to suck  every bit of selfesteem out of him youre like a   a selfesteem sucker  yes exactly  alan i was just having a conversation with the boy  no no you dont have conversations you  suck selfesteem  i wouldve gotten it  mom i am sorry but i dont think i want you around my son anymore   what  you heard me  you will not do to him  what you did to me and charlie  what did i do to you  what did you do what did she

to your own mother  and the dingo has found another australian baby  rose thats not what happened  we were protecting jake  how by ripping his only grandmother out of his life   he has another grandmother  oh right the sacramento pillfreak  is that what she told you  for the record jakes other grandmother  is out of rehab and doing just fine  we appreciate your concern rose thanks for stopping by  so now youre just gonna slam the door in my face  pretty much  not as satisfying with a glass door  okay first she starts with the phone calls  then she sent rose over i wonder whats next  i dont know but im betting itll be something big  right i understand its terrible  okay let me see what i can do about it  how in the hell did your mother get my cell phone number  sometimes when the nest is threatened   the seemingly docile creatures have been known to eat their own young  hey did mom call you at the office today  no she call here   no its been pretty quiet  yeah maybe too quiet
