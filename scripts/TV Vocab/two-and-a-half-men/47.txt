                hey jake why dont you tell grandma about your spring break   bad idea  what  nothing i just saw that theyre moving the la gardening exposition  to the convention center which i think is a very bad idea  thanks for the update go ahead jake tell grandma   it was really cool l  hang on a second jake  im not sure you understand how serious this gardening thing is  its a really bad idea  i get it bad idea  go ahead jake  i went camping with grandma and grandpa  we slept in a tent we cooked on an open fire  and we went hiking and saw a bear  you let him spend an entire vacation with his other grandparents  and i havent had him for a night  oh bad idea  this is unfair and unacceptable  from the moment that boy was born  judiths parents squeezed me out and you let them  interesting point  excuse me mom but when jake was born  judiths mother stayed with us cooking and cleaning  and taking care of him  valid counterpoint  exactly shes a pushy pushy woman  personal opinion  no no you went on a cruise  but judith was two days late  and i had nonrefundable reservations  like it would have killed her to get a csection  selfobsessed psychotic rant   mom are you listening to yourself  stupid question  awkward silence  you wanna spend more time with your grandson hes right here  no he goes to visit his other grandparents  he should come to visit me   so you wanna spend a week with him  a week  alan i do have a life  im confused what exactly do you want  the same quality time jake spends with his other grandparents  but you know less  ill tell you what bring him to my place around 6ish tonight  ill make him dinner well have a fun sleepover   gee mom i dont know  well why not  are you afraid one night with me will irreparably damage him   yeah  a little  excuse me i didnt hear any complaints when i was raising you two  the teenage drinking and constant running away wasnt a slight tipoff  oh you were just a little drama queen charlie  and lets not forget you always came back  kind of hard to find steady work when youre 9  whatever my place 6ish  judith i cant just leave him with you without discussing it with his mother  are you telling me you need to get your exwifes approval  to let your own son spend time with your own mother  he had a really bad lawyer  you know what your problem is alan you let women walk all over you  you get that from your father  well nevertheless i still have to clear it with judith   well fine call her  right now  well why not unless youd rather i make the call  probably not home ill just ill leave a message  yeah hi judith  listen its alan call me back when you get a chance  hello oh hi judith you old callscreener you  listen i just wanted to run something past you  jake was telling my mom about
