then dinner fried chicken mashed potatoes and a baloney sandwich  okay its not what he ate  then for a snack i had a glass of tang and some cheetos  that explains the orange vomit  its probably a stomach virus  oh please i throw up all the time  its just natures way of saying everybody out of the pool   im putting him to bed come on  they have beds in vegas   what if he needs a doctor  they have doctors in vegas  i bet if we looked around we could find a casino with a hospital theme  you know caesars sinai or something  ill get it  hello hey mom  fine nothing  i threw up in uncle

alimony checks  you already got one  so whats the deal are we going   i dont think so  why im fine   yeah but your mom said no  oh man  dont eat anything orange   you wanna know what i think  not at all  i think if she wanted to keep you on a leash  she shouldnt have divorced you  im not on a leash i never was  you were living here for three weeks  before you were getting up on the couch without permission  can we just drop it it was a bad idea  there are no bad ideas theres just a lack of will to execute them  were men alan single men  we go where we want when we want and how we want  usually without so much toiletries  but im trying to be flexible here  i explained about the toiletries  the point is you cant let your exwife control your behavior  no matter how stupid or selfdestructive it might be   charlie l  what profit a man  if he escapes the iron shackles of matrimony  only to surrender to sexually frustrated tyranny of a vengeful exwife  you know what youre right   were men  right are you with me   im with you  grab your pack were going to vegas   jake  just a sec  its okay its mostly water  im fine lets go were men  nope youre too sick  some other time

they lost   what about the spread  they didnt cover  give me back my money  get some rest   im hungry  get used to it   thats some great kid  yeah  sick as a dog and all he wants is a little action  well he gets that from you  you think so   because i do try to be a role model  i know you do  listen theres no reason you have to stick around  hes gonna sleep i can keep an eye on him  no no i couldnt go now  why not you wanted to go to vegas you should go  youre probably gonna have a better time without jake and me  probably unquestionably   then why dont you go  i dont know  it just feels somehow wrong to abandon the kid when hes sick  now you know what it feels like to be a parent  how inconvenient   whats that  it sounds like lynyrd skynyrd  berta  surprise  im gonna start the iv  in a few seconds youre gonna feel drowsy  no no drowsy i wanna be out completely out  dont worry you will be   right doctor  aye  you wont be remembering anything me bucko  thanks doc heres the 2 grand
