you dont wanna wait too long shes no spring chicken  you know eggwise  so im having this nice mothers day dinner with my slutty daughter  and her idiot boyfriend  suddenly the front door comes down and the room fills with tear gas  next thing i know im bellyup on the floor hacking out a lung  while the cops are dragging out bonnie and claude in handcuffs  come to find out that the money that i loaned them to open a tanning salon  was used to turn my tool shed into a hydroponic pot farm   unbelievable  yeah  your daughter came to visit on mothers day  sure what ungrateful mutt doesnt visit their mother on mothers day   one year i forgot let it go  whens my birthday   excuse me  you heard me   whats that got to do with anything  you dont know your mothers birthday   well not by heart  charlie   what she changes it all the time  just the year not the day  hey i just realized something i can leave  fine but before you go just tell me one thing   what  why do you hate me  oh mom for gods sakes l rose  no no no rose wait rose come on in  look my moms here you like my mom   oh sure hi evelyn  hello dear   are those my pants  oh no  i bought these  but i think this might be your wallet and keys  evelyn you get younger every time i see you  oh arent you a dear and thank you for the birthday card   oh did you get it on time  yes i did and it was lovely  so sweet of you to remember me  how could anybody forget your birthday  well yeah you know she does become a little emotional at times huh  i thought she was getting over your divorce  no no she was over the divorce while i was still packing  no what youre seeing is low blood sugar  the trick to that is to always have some fun size snickers in your pocket   itll perk her right up  really  oh yeah oh and heres another tip  when she starts crying for no reason and she will  never say dont cry and try not to touch her   okay  or whistle  never ever whistle  okay maybe i forgot a birthday or two maybe i dont return every single call  but that doesnt mean i hate her  was he breastfed  of course he was not by me personally  thats interesting i see the bras that come through here  and he does tend to favor the big yams   i do not  oh really   raquel welch  hey thats a damn fine film  come to think of it the night we were together  he did spend a freakish amount of time on my boobies  i mean foreplay is one thing but golly it was like making love to a cat  rose for gods sake youre talking to my mother  sorry a very giving cat  hes always had an oral fixation  when he was little he used to suck on other childrens thumbs  and now hes always got a bottle of booze in his mouth  my therapist says thats his way of stuffing his feelings   thats what my therapist says  hell i couldve told you that for free   hey im here  hey its jake  back from his sleepover look whos here to see you buddy  hi grandma  hello sweetheart thank you for the lovely birthday card   my mom picked it out  oh and you love her dont you   sure  thank you you can go now   can i go too  were not done with you   where were we  we were trying to figure out  why charlie hates you  yeah  well charlie  okay fine here it is  im not saying i hate you but if i did  it might have to do with the fact that youre a narcissistic bloodsucker  who drove my father into an early grave  then married a succession of men who couldnt care less about alan and me  which was fine with you  because you looked at us like dancing monkeys  you could just haul out whenever it suited you  and when it didnt you sent us off to boarding school or camp  or that kibbutz in israel where we got beat up  because we werent even jewish  and now now you show up here every chance you get  to lay a guilt trip on me  for not appreciating my cold ionely loveless childhood  well  obviously youre not ready to talk about it   alan you really dont have to do this  hey hey i am a licensed chiropractor  if jake had a sore throat im sure youd treat him prescribe something  but its nothing i think i just slept wrong  oh thats probably because youre not used to our bed  so have you have you met judiths parents   no  oh they are just gonna love you  they were devastated by the divorce  not to mention some of her unfortunate choices thereafter   unfortunate choices  oh you know thats not important  whats important is theyre just gonna be relieved to see shes dating a man  you carry a lot of tension up here  alan   didnt you just pay your alimony  this is the pediatricians bill   jake was sick  no no  the pediatrician had to see an orthopedist  you know moms birthday was a couple weeks ago  yeah i sent her some flowers and a card  oh man would it have killed you to put my name on the card  i did put your name on it i wrote love your sons alan and charlie   damn  what  she tricked me into thinking i forgot
