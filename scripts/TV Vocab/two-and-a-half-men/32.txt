come on put it in the holster wild bill  no no no this isnt about sex  i need you to watch jake for the rest of the weekend  so that nancy and i can go to vegas and get married  oh god alan theres no need to marry the woman  if you dont wanna have sex anymore just tell her  no no you dont understand  this is beyond sex  were in love  alan come here  you are not in love youre besotted  no no no i have never felt like this about a woman before  we have a bond that transcends the physical   really  yeah   kind of a spiritual thing  yes  okay i can understand that so wheres she from  shes from around here   where  supermarket  charlie stop that  i have thought this through and i am really and truly in love with   nancy  i knew that i knew that  i was looking for the proper adjective to describe her  nuts easy limber  charlie charlie you started off on the wrong foot with my first wife  do not make the same mistake with  wonderful nancy  okay youre right this is not about her come here sit down   you gonna hit me  well lets see how it goes  okay look ive never been much of a big brother to you  i didnt protect you i wasnt around when you started dating  when you got married and had jake you know why   why  i was busy getting laid  which makes me the perfect big brother to help you now  ive been through this i know what it means to confuse sex with love  thats not what im doing charlie  were talking about me and ive been down this road many times  i remember this one girl  we had this unbelievably hot weekend together  it was like nothing id ever experienced before and i proposed   i begged her to marry me  wow where did you meet  detention   this was in high school  eighth grade  and then years later it happened again with a different woman  instant chemistry the sex was unbelievable  i was convinced we were soul mates so i threw myself at her  i did everything to get her to marry me  and you know what if shed said yes  id now have a 67yearold exwife on a belly dancers pension  so what im trying to say  is youre not the first guy to mistake passion for true love  and you wont be the last  if someone had told me what im telling you  i could have saved myself a lot of heartache  okay i hear you thank you  youre welcome  so make sure jake doesnt fill up on junk food and ill call you from circus circus  circus circus  youre right money should be no object whats the hotel with the pirate show  im sorry alan but im gonna have to knock you out   hello  mom thank god youre here  oh i dont need your sarcasm charlie  no i mean it i need you alan needs

the supermarket a few days ago  and were getting married  i see  for gods sake if youre that horny find a nice call girl put her on retainer  this is not about sex  oh please what else could it be   well it could be love  yeah sure  who is this woman what does she do  she does alan  okay okay that that is how it started  but in the last day and a half it has blossomed into so much more  oh my randy little nincompoop  listen if i had gotten married  after every weekend of hot sweaty debauchery with a virtual stranger  youd have well many more stepfathers than you already have  she knows what shes talking about alan  moms been on more hotel pillows than a chocolate mint  dont help me charlie  now now listen sweetheart sweetheart no offense  but since youre dirtpoor and living with your brother  one must ask what kind of woman would agree to marry you  unless shes a little slow or looking for a green card  listen to your mommy alan  no no i am gonna listen to my heart  for your information she hasnt agreed to marry me   i havent even asked her yet  but youre planning to   yes  im not going to hit you darling  charlie  okay look i will thank you both to let me live my own life  i love nancy and nancy loves me  and if this is a mistake then it will be my mistake  hello nancy you miss me i miss you  listen theres something i wanna ask you but i wanna do it in person  oh
