public service  when people die their families are very very sad  and they have no idea what their homes are worth  and you tell them  oh you are so cute  and grandmommy doesnt just prey on the dead jake  she also profits from the pain of divorce and the humiliation of bankruptcy  not to mention shes working on an alternative fuel made from puppies  oh my god harry gorsky died  oh no are you sure its him  how many harry luther gorskys are there in los angeles   well theres one less now  who are you talking about  he was uncle charlies and my stepdad   the first of three and not my favorite  i liked him  oh please you were 6 you still liked mom   mom are you okay  no im not okay  he was a good man  and part of my life and now hes gone  i just pray he died peacefully  and held on to that stately sixbedroom fourbath colonial  in hancock park  with the bonus officeguest room over the garage  let me get this straight  first there was your dad then this guy harry who died  then the fat guy with the carpet business  no no no the fat guy came after the twitchy gay guy from texas  who gave us crew cuts and called us buckaroos  so out of the three  harry was the best  i liked the fat guy remember  with the chubby daughter who was so grateful  all you had to do was knock on her door with some turkish taffy  be that as it may he was still a very good father to us  oh please he was a little tyrant  sit up straight do your homework  quit forging my signature on hotel bills  okay then the funeral is tomorrow  i think it would be appropriate for us all to go and pay our respects  i dont know tomorrows not good for me  oh charlie the man was your father  no he was not  why do you care so much you divorced him  just because you divorce doesnt mean you no longer have feelings  thats true judith still has feelings for me  pity is not really a feeling alan  regardless of our feelings well still go and say our final goodbyes to harry   im not going  me neither   fine you stay here with uncle charlie  cool  yeah cool why do you wanna go  i think its the right thing to do and i liked harry   and he liked you  i know  weve stayed in touch over the years  what  you betrayed me by communicating with that son of a bitch after i divorced him  well wait a minute you said that  i know what i said  i was just being polite because the guys worm chow  all i did was send him christmas cards and a picture of jake   you never send me a picture of jake  hes right here  when was the last time i got a christmas card  wait im on your side charlies the one who doesnt wanna go  i dont even know if i want you to come now youve ruined it   how can you ruin a funeral  i dont wanna talk about it anymore   where are you going  i need something black  doesnt your soul qualify  laugh

his funeral  and you know taking a victory lap  charlie youre not gonna wanna hear this  but you sound a lot like mom  tread lightly   jake youre coming with us  i dont wanna  you get to see a real dead guy  theres gonna be a dead guy where   at the funeral  oh cool can i come  did i say he was gonna live here until 30  i meant forever  what are you talking about   go put on your nice clothes

isnt that why were going to the funeral to make sure  im confused if you cared for harry so much how come you left him  yes well about that  i may have glossed over the details with you boys just a skosh  i didnt actually leave harry so much as he left me   youre kidding  he met a younger woman  and just traded me in  you still loved him didnt you  i loved him very much  oh harry my sweet dear harry  all right level eight  so wheres the dead guy  jake show a little respect  wheres the dead guy sir  in the chapel now keep it down  i think i can smell him  oh lord there she is   who  the

sorry for your loss  its not my loss he left me for that tramp over there  she doesnt look very unhappy does she  she just met him wait a week  i think its the responsibility of we the living to carry

in malibu   hi  im sorry for your loss   thank you  alan came to live with me  at my malibu beach house when he lost his wife  its a healing house  my wife isnt really dead  because you healed  at my malibu beach house  and when you think about it harry isnt really dead either  he lives right here  in all of us   thank you  good let go  its good to let go  charlie  excuse me a moment  what what what what what  what do you mean what what what   youre hitting on the widow  no im consoling the widow  i wont hit on her until they close the lid  unbelievable how do you sleep at night  usually drunk and on top of somebody  but that takes work alan doesnt just happen by itself  heres an idea why dont you run to the embalming room  and see if you can score a couple fresh ones off the truck  excuse me but considering your exwife  id say youre the expert on having sex with cold women who dont move  nevertheless you can hit on women anywhere  why did you bother to come  i dont know i just did   thats it no reason  do you have a reason for everything   yes  so hows that working out for you  i know how difficult it must be  rambling around all by yourself in that big drafty sixbedroom colonial  with the guest roomoffice over the garage  harry gave me a potbellied pig  so youd remember him sure  but i know harry would want you to move on  and this is the perfect time to move on  because this is a sellers market  excuse me  can we talk to you a minute  pardon me dear  what im working here  that woman just lost her husband  alan the man was 50 years old when she was born   so  so she had to see it coming  even for you that is really cold  oh mr graveside nookie weighs in  you were trying to give the widow a sympathetic crotch to cry on  hey watch your mouth this is a solemn event  yeah show a little class  me im the only one here behaving appropriately  hey wheres jake   jake  how do you know my name   its okay  okay  i almost pooped my pants  what are you doing  i just wanted to see  okay well lets lets take a look   really  yeah come on   what do you think  i dont know   how did he die  he just got old  his heart stopped  his watch is still going   yep  why would he need a watch anyway  its not like hes gonna be late for anything  okay there are other people waiting to pay their respects  why dont we go find grandma  i dont care what anybody says  i always thought you were a good guy  thanks alan  want to know what time it is  lets go   hows he look  dead  cool  surprise  listen i just wanted to tell you that ive been thinking about it  and maybe some of the stuff between us may have been my fault  i was angry about losing my dad and i guess  you were the guy i took it out on  anyway not that it makes a lot of difference at this point  but i just wanted you to know that im sorry  by the way im gonna take a shot at your wife  but thats just a guy thing  nothing personal okay  ill take that as a yes  and so with every door that god closes he opens a window  did he say window or widow  even as we say goodbye to our beloved friend  harry luther gorsky  we know that he lives on in all of us   how are you holding up  okay   lf you need anything im right here  thank you thats very comforting  for everything there is a season  a time to be born a time to die  a time to reap a time to sow  so  i would like to invite anyone  who wishes to say a few words about harry  to come up and share with us  as always ill do him first   mom bad idea  hey  if i didnt give in to bad ideas you wouldnt be here hold this  dad i cant find my gameboy  not now jake  hello welcome to harrys funeral  i havent seen him so drained of bodily fluids since our honeymoon  what i thought id open with a joke  my name is evelyn harper  or as dear harry used to call me his sweet little sugar tushy  when i first met harry  i was just a hot young widow with bills to pay  who could lick the chrome off a trailer hitch  i also had two small boys  one of whom harry cared for very deeply  the other one was charlie  it wasnt easy being a substitute father  but harry gave it his all  unfortunately it wasnt enough  which is probably why he looked for solace  in the arms of a cheap slut  stand up christine let everybody have a look at you  take a good look heather thats gonna be you someday  oh im sorry im being disrespectful to the grieving widow  but listen you wanna talk grieving im grieving  i loved this man with all my heart and you left me you lousy bastard  well take a good look ive still got a great ass  and yours is decomposing as we speak  thank you   okay that was beautiful  time to go  ill call you   dad what about my gameboy  forget it just keep walking  and so lets take a moment of silent prayer for our friend harry  i am really really sorry  got it  its my kids i dont know maybe i spoil him  okay bye  boys when i die  i want a simple funeral no tears   done  you got it  and i wanna be buried next to your father  dad was cremated mom  oh yes right  i was thinking of someone else  so i take it youd rather be buried than cremated  oh cant we do both  i want to be buried on the side of a hill  nestled amongst the willows overlooking the ocean  do we get to pick the ocean  and i want an unadorned headstone which reads simply  evelyn harper loving wife devoted mother  thats good open with a joke
