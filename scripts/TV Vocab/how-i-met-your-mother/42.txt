problem its a license to eat  look what have you always wanted to eat but didnt because it was too ridicuusly decadent  ooh a valrhona chocolate souffl with a raspberry brandy sauce  topped with caramelized bananas and hazelnut gelato  i have cool whip and half a bag of fritos  done  okay think youre gonna be happy with my new toast  theres nothing sexual  its uh its just the story of an important moment in your relationship  im all ears  hello everyone im ted mosby marshalls best man   nice  right thats great  back when we were all freshman  and marshall and lily were just a few short weeks into their relationship  it was 400 in the morning and im not gonna lie we were a wee bit wasted  we were starving  so id gone out to get us some snacks and when i got back   i love you  i love you too  i know its soon to say it but im so glad you did  yeah  so heres what you want to talk about in front of my entire family  drinking having a girl in my room eating junk food  dude youre almost 30 your mom would be mad at you for eating junk food  yeah ted cause nutritions not important  also so lilys never heard that story before  hows she going to react when she finds out the first time i said i love you to her  i was actually saying it to you and a bag of funyuns  but who cares you did love her and you still do  and youre totally over funyuns so its not weird   hey lil  hey  hey thats it  what are you talking about  well you guys have been spending the last few nights apart  i figured thered be a lot of giggling crying jumping up and down  and then whatever lily would do  now one thing i remember about the bar menu at mcclarens  is that there were no fewer than  that night aunt lily ordered them all  check it out  okay imagine imagine if you will  that this is the 1 space on the price is right wheel  ready  oh wow that was pretty close  close  close its called the price is right not the price is close  oh man this is bad  if i dont win the spinoff and i cant get into the showcase showdown  everythings ruined its all ruined  what is ruined why why is this such a big deal  okay guys sit down ive got to tell you something  the reason im going on the price is right  is because ive decided that its time for me to meet my real father   your father  thats right  my father is bob barker   your dad is bob barker  thats right  the host of the price is right bob barker  thats pops   barney  yes robin  why in the world do you think bob barker is your father  uh because my mother told me he was thats why  mom whos my dad  all the other kids at school know who

popper  lily has to gain five pounds in a week and a half  and it is my job to help her get there  this is the best wedding diet ever   i lost a pound  that is impossible  you ate mcdonalds every meal

lily you can do better than that  i cant  well eat faster before your body figures out its full  im trying oh are you gonna cry  you gonna cry skinny little babys gonna cry   well eat damn it eat  okay  hey so i think i figured out how to do your toast in a completely appropriate way   finally  yeah  good evening im ted mosby marshalls best man   still strong right  great yeah  id like to share with you all a story about the momentous evening last fall  when marshall and lily got back together  afterward we stayed up till 1000 at night   doing shots of chocolate milk  man im well nourished right now  calcium promotes healthy teeth and bones  thanks marshall for teaching us you dont need alcohol to have fun  oh dont thank me thank my parents for teaching me good values  now i wasnt supposed to hear this next part  but marshall leaned over to lily and whispered  you know what id like to do to you right now  id like to hold your hand  id like to hold your hand so hard  that youre not able to shake hands for a week  are you just going to talk about holding my hand or are you going to hold it  then a little later robin caught them  oh um holding hands  it was a lovely and responsible night  to marshall and lily  thats the worst toast ive ever heard dude   its totally boring  exactly  its impossible to write a good toast with you censoring me man  i give up  im just going to read that thing about jesus and the footprints  i give up too i dont care if my dress doesnt fit  i cant eat anymore  ii feel like my stomachs going to explode  i know  and so lily and i were both about to give up  but as you can all see lily does look beautiful in that dress  and here i am giving a toast  you know all this time id been wracking my brain trying to  pick out the perfect moment to capture lily and marshall as a couple  but then i realized the perfect moment wasnt  some needle lost in the haystack of their ten years together  the perfect lily and marshall moment happened two nights ago  marshall what are you doing  going to the bathroom  in the hall  sleepwalking  youre wide awake   robbing us  dude  turns out all week long hed been sneaking out to a hotel on 72nd  to meet lily   god i missed you  i cant sleep without you  hey baby   would you be the big spoon for a while  sure baby   hows the weight gaining going  ugh terribly  im too stressed out without you around  well im here now  and so lily and marshall failed in their experiment with apartness  but they succeeded in getting lily into her dress  you know there really are a million things i could tell you about lily and marshall  but really the only thing you need to know is  that ten years into their relationship  they still couldnt spend a single night apart  may they never have to again  to lily and marshall to lily and marshall  now kids the story of lily and marshalls wedding is a good one  no matter how perfectly you plan your  you know wait a second guys ill get to that  first ive
