                kids in life there are a lot of big romantic moments  and they make life worth living  but heres the problem  moments pass  and lurking just around the corner from those moments  is a cruel unshaven bastard named reality  and so back in 2006  on the night of claudia and stuarts wedding  reality was the enemy  wow the peace corps  yeah i ship out tomorrow two years  you know some people say the peace corps is the most noble thing a person can do  to those people i say is it  and usually they say yes it is  barney they are so right  i wish there was something i could do  oh tanya  im so glad you said that  this wasnt how id thought the night would turn out  this was finally supposed to be my big moment with robin  but then reality came along  robin got called up lastminute to anchor the 1100 news  it was her big break  and i went to the wedding stag  then when i least expected it  hey where the hell did you disappear to last night  i had the most amazing night ever  tell me about it that cake best cake i ever had  seriously my stomach was like  hey bro i dont know what youre eating cause i dont have any eyes  but its basically awesome so keep sending it down gullet alley  yeah i know  my stomach was like girlfriend we dont always get along but that cake  lily  oh right most amazing night ever and go  you know i should tell you i have a rule  i never hook up at weddings  im guessing you havent always had this rule  well heres the thing those big romantic moments  theyre great when they happen but theyre not real  exactly exactly likelike just now when i saw you doing the chicken dance out there  im not gonna lie to you bigtime thunderbolt  mm you should see me tap dance  youd be down on bended knee  sadly not out of character  but i know now its just a mirage  wedding goggles  exactly and that in a nutshell is why im not putting the moves on you  this isnt the moves  what you you think this is the moves  believe me youd know the moves  people ten tables away would know the moves  oh thats too bad  tell me about it  you know i think i have a solution  interested  and to preface this were not gonna sleep together tonight  less interested  go ahead  okay  so the thing that always screws it up is the next day  right so  why dont we just cut that part out  what are you saying  im saying im here youre here this is a big romantic wedding  why dont we just dance and have a great time  and then when its over never see each other again   unless  no no unless  no emails no phone numbers not even names  tonight we will make a memory that will never be tarnished  and then when were old and gray  well look back on this night  and itll be perfect  wow   okay im in  okay  i guess uh what well need fake names  um you can

tongue  okay how about this  the best part of any first kiss is the leadup to it  the moment right before the lips touch its like a big drumroll  so how about tonight we just stick with the drumroll

matter  oh man its gross  does everyone snot up this much when they cry  hey youre speaking to a fellow snotter  so why are you crying  because you have feelings for ted  i dont know  maybe  okay what is wrong with the two of you seriously  he likes you and you like him and jjjust be together  cheese louise happiness is not that difficult  look okay yes i cried in the bathroom and that was weird

you feel  okay fine i have feelings for him  happy  kinda yeah  but it doesnt change anything  i still dont want to get married and hes still ted  what i should do is just tell him who victoria is so he can be happy  or you could tell him that youre into him and then you could both be happy  im going to go find him  well wait  which one are you going to tell him  i have no idea  and heres the most amazing part  because i told her id converted all my money to india dollars  she gave me 50 bucks to take a cab to the airport  thats right i just got paid for sex  i really should give this money to
