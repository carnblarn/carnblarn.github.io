                kids the key to a good relationship is communication   you need to talk  how about mimis  nah i dont really feel like mimis  well im hungry lets just pick a place and go  oh you know where we should go cynthias  you love that place remember what a great time we had  the last time we were there   we did  yeah yeah  we had that crazy waiter who kept going you two should get married  you two should get married  its also important to know when to stop talking  come on then we stepped outside it was raining  it was so romantic  how can you not remember this  because it wasnt me  oh right  it was  my sister  you see by the time youve hit your late 20s  youve dated a few people  but when youre in a relationship its common courtesy to pretend  that you havent  oh my god van helsing is on  remember when we went to see it  we sat in the back row  ive never seen van helsing  thats right i saw it with my sister  my boss just got back from maui  he said it was really romantic  oh its so romantic  when were you in maui   i went with my sister  with my sister  why do you always say that  look were not 16 weve both dated other people  its silly to try to act like we didnt  youre right  we should just be honest  totally  see that girl over there  three years ago i totally made out with her  i dont want to hear that   what you said  god that is so insensitive   remember honesty  youre a jerk  well youre  confusing      okay so you have to have sex with one  either classic mermaid bottom half fish top half human  or inverted mermaid top half fish bottom half human  go  i dont know is she fat  yeah but its a fish so its the good kind of fat  hot off the presses  ii dont take flyers  you took one two seconds before you walked in here  thats different it was for a strip club  two bucks off wings  how much is your flyer going to save me on wings  fine its a flyer from my play  oh lily id love to but were not in college  and im not trying to sleep with you   so anyway this mermaid  hey lilys friend asked her  to be in this play and its gonna be really good  lily i love you but were too old for this  asking someone to come see your play  is like asking someone for a ride to the airport  or to crash on your couch or to help you move  call a cab book a room  hire some movers and repeat after me  friends  dont let friends come see their crappy play  okay first of all ive thought about it and top half fish  second of all we need you guys to decide something for us  yes you should break up  so earlier tonight  mm we should get down to the bar  i know we should  but you just look so sexy in my red sweatshirt  oh god why is this part of the story  were getting to it  damn my face is so dry is there any moisturizer around here  yeah theres some in the bathroom  got to moisturize  got to keep that pretty face moist  oh no no no no no no   whats wrong with her  she hates that word   what word moist  no seriously stop  so anyway ted goes into the bathroom to get the moist  face lotion  wow this is great stuff  now i know the secret to your great complexion  what are you talking about its yours  no its not  oh well then i guess its lilys  no its not  whose moisturizer is this ted  um my sisters  so in other words some girl you went out with  um i love you  disgusting you let me put on the same moisturizer as one of your exes  it was probably carlas her face was a train wreck  im dont think ted was dating her for her face  thank you marshall  thank you so much  why is that still in your apartment  i dont know i just never threw it out  well why not do you still have feelings for this girl  yeah im madly in love with her  and the only way i can deal with it  is by holding onto a threedollar tube of lotion  not three dollars try 14  why is this such a big deal  because i dont want to use some whores moisturizer  whoa she wasnt a whore  well shes leaving expensive lotions all over town  it sounds like a whore to me  what else do you have from old girlfriends just lying around  nothing thats it  well except for the phone booth  and the lamp by the desk  and the  no  no no oh ted  ah the ageold question  after  you break up with someone what do you do with the stuff  question aint no question girl  obviously hes got to get rid of it  which is obviously crazy and obviously im not gonna do it  so we agreed that we  would let you guys decide  yeah like we did with marshalls pants  ah the 2005 landmark case of lily v the joey buttafuoco pants  nice right  im gonna have to say no  i dont want some 16yearold girl falling in love with you  and then shooting lily in the face  yes  i vote they can stay  check out the jackass in the parachute pants is a good icebreaker  t ed  ted ted  sorry buddy its a no for me too  oh and by the way bel biv devoe called  even they dont want those pants back  they were insanely comfortable  they were like pajamas you could wear outside  marshall its over  we even gave you an appeal and they didnt look any better with combat boots  all right well lets hear the arguments ted you go first  okay the fact that i still have things from exgirlfriends is no big deal  i mean when i see the phone booth on the piano  i dont think of jeannie radford  i think of the good times i had backpacking through europe  and when i see the lamp i dont think of allison moses  i remember when i was broke just out of college  and i really needed a lamp  and when i see that throw pillow i dont think of lauren stein  i think of that weird orangebrown stain and how it got there  creamsicle and turkey gravy  not at the same time  well thats adorable  but from now on when i walk into the apartment here is what i will see  im teds college girlfriend he made me 12 mix tapes  how many has he made you  he calls you sweetie pie  he called me sweetie pie  im stupid but my rack is bigger than yours  really you cant look at a pillow  without seeing my exgirlfriend a pillow  yes ted the fact that you still have that pillow is creepy and gross   youre creepy and gross  your moms creepy and gross  order order  i got to side with robin  shes your girlfriend and if the stuff upsets her you got to get rid of it  ive got to side with ted  just cause you still have something an exgirlfriend gave you  doesnt mean youre holding onto her  all right barney  it all comes down to you   i side with robin  what  ted your place is too cluttered  its like youre living in a bennigans  or a danbys  what they dont have danbys in the us  really  well then were do you get grizzly paw ice cream sandwiches  just stop sweetie  so i had no choice  i packed up everything i had gotten from exgirlfriends  it was painful  but not as painful as what i had to endure later that night  new york is famous for its theater  but theres many different levels  theres broadway  offbroadway  offoffbroadway  homeless people screaming in the park  and then below that the play aunt lily was in  eight flights of stairs  who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs  what kind of building is this  from the smell of it im guessing a urine factory  where do you guys want to sit  i know where i dont want to sit  guys four together  i brought a bag in case anyone needs to puke  come on its not gonna be that bad  no okay  i am rage  i am greed  i am rage envy  i am outta here  no youre not you have to stay  this is the face of consumerism  oh my god teds part of the play  hello greed rage  envy  and consumerism  i am your father  america  oh baby that was wonderful  totally i had no idea greed was the killer  and when it became a play within a play  i was like now we are really cookin  wow lily that sucked  barney  what it was terrible  i mean come on you guys agree right  hey sorry im just being honest cause you know were friends  no friends make each other feel good  they build each other up and support them  thats what being a good friend is about  yeah if youre a smurf  you know if you did a play i would sit through the whole thing  and i would compliment you on it afterwards  oh really you would  yes  bad move aldrin bad move  well be starting our qa with the director  yours truly  in five minutes right here  can you believe barney said that about lilys play  i know he can be really insensitive  it was pretty bad though  oh my god it was so bad  oh my god youve been robbed  nope  all that stuff was from old girlfriends  dont you buy anything for yourself  what can i say  papa gets swag  and that shouldve been the end of it but the next day  you know at first i was really bummed about getting rid of all my stuff  but seeing how happy it makes you totally worth it  mm thats kind of how i feel when i begrudgingly have sex with you  when im really tired  exactly sometimes you gotta take one for the team  well sit sit yeah  so you never keep anything your exboyfriends gave you  nope  well except for my dogs  so i had to get rid of everything from my past relationships  because you dont keep things from your past relationships  except uh where are your five dogs from oh thats right  your past relationships  whats your point ted  well you know how you said  you come over to my apartment  and all you can see are my exgirlfriends  what so when you look at my dogs all you see is my exboyfriends  i do now  thats ridiculous  i thought you said you got rid of everything your exboyfriends gave you  well yeah but not my dogs  you said everything  but not living things  well tell that to the rare bolivian cactus i threw away  things with a heartbeat can stay  enjoying this  pickles go get your ball  go get your ball  just admit it it was a little hypocritical of you  to make me get rid of all my stuff  well what do you want me to do ted get rid of my dogs  guess what position we did it in  yes yes i want you to get rid of your dogs  um no  really well i say we take it to the group  but i dont like your chances  shes not getting rid of the dogs  whats the matter with you   even i wouldnt do that  yes  you can ask somebody to get rid of their iguana after it poops in your hair  but not their dog  i miss jebediah  oh i almost forgot  flyers for my new play  very funny  oh its not a joke  its my oneman show premiering tomorrow night  and even though its terrible and excruciatingly long  i expect you all to be there since were such good friends  oh well be there  unless of course you just want to admit that you were wrong   never  good  okay i gotta go rehearse  oh i almost forgot bring a poncho  the first three rows get wet  im sorry i didnt tell you where the dogs came from  im sorry i asked you to get rid of them  that was ridiculous  so werewere okay  yeah were great   and i thought we were  but just as it did in the seventh act of aunt lilys play  jealousy reared its ugly head  oh yeah thats the spot  dude i gotta pee  i gotta go  oh hes really having trouble dealing with this huh  yeah he really is  its got me thinking maybe i should get rid of my dogs  might be time to send them to the farm   youre gonna kill your dogs  no no no no  there really is a farm  my aunt has a farm upstate  oh thank god  aw you know if i were five dogs  id rather live on a farm than in an apartment in brooklyn  yeah i could visit them on weekends  my aunt is awfully lonely up there its just her and her lover betty  oh thats perfect they love dogs  they what do you mean by they  uh uh uh people upstate  oh look its starting shh  are you sure youre gonna be okay  i mean you know that this is gonna be  i know but im gonna sit through the whole thing  and im gonna say something nice about it afterwards  you know why  because thats what friends do  moist  moist  moist  moist  that was the first 40 minutes of barneys show  moist  and then we endured about 20 minutes of this  i have to go refill  ill be back in a moment  plays not over  i never get picked for audience participation  and then it just got weird  feelings  inside  oh no  and when that didnt work  okay stop  you win fine  barney im sorry i made you come to my show  thank you lily  is there anything youd like to say about my show  no  no i have nothing nice to say about your show  you were

stride  spoiler alert the robot falls in love  how about this barney how about we stay  andand watch the rest of your show  its your funeral  five six one two  so we stayed and let barney torture us

i think its for the best  wow  oh man  can we go inside  uh no uh lets go to the bar  why whats going on inside   um the floors are gone  what  yeah ii sent them out to get um fixed  this is a terrible lie im just going to bail  i didnt know you were getting rid of the dogs  you said you threw all that stuff away  kids this was the worst fight robin and i ever had  it was one of those fights that last for hours  and you start to get woozy and lose track of what youre fighting about  we fought for so long seasons changed outside the window  pages of the calendar blew off it was crazy  but ultimately and i couldnt tell you how for the life of me  but somehow we got to here  were really doing this  yeah   were moving in together  were moving in together  the robot found love  confusing my circuitry  my softwares been hacked  toaster oven  youre the one for me  two three four  thats two
