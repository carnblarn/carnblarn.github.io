                in may of 2007 aunt lily and uncle marshall got married  at the historic van smoot house in upstate new york  wow its beautiful lily  yeah its just how i always pictured it  well that was a load of crap  you see kids when you get married you learn a hard lesson  the wedding you set out to have is almost never the wedding you end up with  so weve decided on a small outdoor wedding  just family and close friends  no more than 25 people  in a beautiful garden somewhere  maybe an acoustic guitar playing  while we walk down the aisle  and maybe you already know someone who went down to the courthouse  and registered as an officiant  so that he or she he  could perform the ceremony  but you hate marriage why do you want to perform the ceremony  because it subtly implants in the mind of every woman there  that when i ask a question  you say i do  yeah  the closer you get to the big day  the more concessions you make  great now my moms making me invite the lessners  this puts our numbers in the triple digits  wow i guess sometimes lessner is more ner  you know how like sometimes less is more  yeah this is one of those times sweetie  you know what thats okay itll be a slightly big outdoor wedding  so its not going to be an outdoor wedding anymore  marshalls dad is convinced if we have an outdoor wedding in new york  hes going to get mugged so its going to be inside now  itll be great were still going to have our acoustic guitar player  so now instead of an acoustic guitar  were having a harp player  yeah my dad owes a guy and that guys daughter plays the harp  is she hot id love to be able to cross harp player off my list  how long is this list  dude im not gonna count how many pages the list is  im not crass  well it doesnt matter anyway shes pregnant  sweet i can cross off two things  and the day arrives for lily and marshalls very big indoor wedding  with a harp  hi lily  wow andrea  you really are pregnant  yeah  how do you play the harp with your belly so  oh i dont really i can only reach about half the strings  you only play half the harp  yeah  oh no uh okay lily i will take care of this  um ill just pluck the other half is it hard to learn  ive been studying the harp for 12 years  yeah but im a fast learner  you ever hear of guitar hero learned that in a day  is there a harp hero  robin its fine  so so when are you due  tuesday  wow thats soon  last tuesday  holy crap we have to fire her  shes gonna drop a shorty in the middle of your ceremony  robin im not going to freak myself out  i hate those women who say  oh my wedding has to be perfect  things go wrong sometimes the deejay screws up your playlist  sometimes you slip on placenta during the recessional  can i grab a scotch and soda real quick  no im not allowed to serve anything until the reception  wow you just cost yourself a big tip buddy  im not allowed to accept tips buddy  you allowed to accept criticism  you sir are an ass buddy  hey you want to know what line doesnt work on a harp player  hey baby want to pluck  really that didnt work  not even a little  hey whos bill  bill  yeah this guy came up to me at the bar  can i ask you something  where in the ceremony is the place where they ask if anyone objects  uh dont think they do that anymore  oh so when do you think someone should do it  just wait for a lull or what  oh no  did he look like a guy who tried to be an umpire but failed  he kind of did  thats scooter  your high school boyfriend scooter  his real name is bill  my mom must have invited him  why why would she do that  our families are really close  but my exboyfriend  come on mom  i didnt invite that professional squash player dad busted you with  oh i need a glass of wine  ill get it  oh thanks hey hows marshall doing  hes great  hes about to get his hair cut  oh im worried my cousins going to cut it too short  me too i was up all night  hello lily  hey bill  hey barney  scooter what are you doing here  its not scooter anymore  its bill  a lot of things have changed about me lily  but one hasnt  i still love you  and i came here to win you back  youre really cute oh no really  lily ii know its crazy  but i love you  and if you can look me in the eye  and tell me that you want to marry marshall  i will leave right now and be out of your life forever  i want  i want  scooter  i need a glass of wine  and i need you to get out of my face  its for the bride so  white or red  white  and uh shed also like a scotch and soda  you got it  shed also like a bowl of smoked almonds  i dont have any  but i guess i could run out to the corner and get some  well its only the biggest day of her life so  let the games begin  here cant stay got to try something  maybe my words wont change your mind  but maybe the words of a poet will  i read from november rain  by w axl rose  that is a good song  barney said you needed me to bounce some guy named scooter  whats up with bill  thats scooter  im on it   hey  hey  can i have your phone number  no  its for the bride  oh hold on let me go get a pen  the bride wants you to walk slower  oh wow  oh robin  my makeup looks perfect right now  and im about to cry do something  i have hairy nipples  really  no but it worked didnt it  hey funny story  i tackled this guy i thought was scooter  turns out it was your photographer  dont worry i got this sweet camera phone so were covered  theres a photographer  oh my god   okay i just have to call  robin stop stop  its okay  i am not gonna let anything get to me today  i just got a call from the florist the flowers wont be here  till halfway through the ceremony  im okay  i hate to bother you but i think i found your veil in the parking lot  im fine  just fyi my water broke  but i can probably  make it through  totally cool  oh no  lily i think i forgot your bridal panties  ii thought i had them im so sorry  oh its okay ill just wear the ones i have on  are you sure  im marrying marshall today  so it doesnt even matter that im gonna walk down the aisle  without a veil in a room that has no flowers  to the music of half a harp played by a woman whos crowning  as my high school boyfriend reads guns n roses lyrics  but thats okay  because theres no photographer there to take any pictures of it anyway  lily are you okay  what do you think of course im not okay  everything that could possibly go wrong at my wedding has  its ruined  what happened to i dont want a perfect wedding  oh grow up robin of course i want a perfect wedding  oh god i wanted i wanted not to care about the wedding but  i do i im supposed to feel like a princess today  and you will  its gonna be okay sweetie  why dont we go outside i have something thatll make you feel better  what could you have that could possibly make me feel better  god i hope marshalls having a better day than im having  oh my god oh my god  oh my god  oh my god   oh my god  what  well its not too short  my hair look at my hair she ruined my hair  i look like one of the backstreet boys  you totally do  and not even the good backstreet boys  the older lame dance move comeback tour backstreet boys  the good backstreet boys  guys guys what am i gonna do  whatwhat the hell happened to you  lilys cousin is in beauty school  and lily didnt want her to do her hair  so she said she could do mine  so um just notnot too short okay  oh no we dont even have to cut it at all  could just give it some style  oh okay yeah thats great  cause um when it gets too short it starts to look weird  and i dont want to look weird when im up there you know  ooh i could give you some cool guy tips  i dont think i need advice on how to be cool  but yeah great lay that on me  i cant get married like this theres no way  ah let me see what i can do  what what can you do  i have a superpower  lily is gonna kill me  look at me  shes not gonna want to marry me like this  thats crazy of course she will  would you marry me  no but not because of the hair its because i have a rule  never marry anyone youve had a farting contest with  oh great so now youre saying lily and i shouldnt even get married  could i have everyones attention please  its for the bride  one the bride would  like all of this tension out of my shoulders  and she would like lets say  you in the inappropriately short dress to rub them  two  what was two  okay we have a bit of a situation  lets not panic  lets just find a solution  dude you shaved your freakin head  yeah yeah but its good  i ought to shave it all off what a great solution  just be bald cause its cool right  bruce willis michael jordan britney spears  oh god what did i do  how could you let me shave my head   what  youre the worst best man ever  i hate you  im not going out there im leaving and im never coming back  im gonna go find that money under the rock by the tree  and go live with the guys on the beach in zihautanejo  dude those guys are criminals  only red andy was falsely accused  ted youre my best man you got to do something  okay all right come here just breathe breathe all right  dont worry dont worry   ill just ill take these  no   uh hi uncle ben right  yes  yes were were having a little bit of a problem back there  um and i was wondering if you could help us out  yeah  marshall accidentally shaved part of his head   oh no  yeah  yeah so heres what i was thinking  what if i found something to cover up the bald area  yeah that would probably work  but with what  thats a tough one  maybe a wig of some sort or a um  toupee  something that matches his hair color  which is which is kind of the same color as the top of your hair  mm yeah  does anyone here wear a toupee  shouldnt be hard to find out  most of them are pretty bad  that is true that is true  we just need to find someone who wears a toupee  that is the same color  as marshalls and your hair  boy thats a pretty tall order  really  you cant think of any place in the general area  where there might be a toupee of the kind im describing to you  no not off the top of my  no cant  let me come at this from a different angle i got 50 in my pocket   which is probably a lot more  the bride needs this  actually i think it kinda works  it totally does  barney  to be honest im uh  im jealous i dont get to wear it  okay problem solved  crisis averted  lets get me married  it looks terrible doesnt it  it kinda looks like fur  which gives you the appearance of a cleanedup bigfoot   oh you know  in a bad way  hey cool hair bro  what happened to your shirt  i got sauce on it when i tackled the caterer  you gonna put another shirt on  no im good  hey you guys seen scooter  what what scooters here that guys at my wedding  not for long bro  not for long  okay you know what i need some air  i think we should go for a walk okay  it would cover up the problem  its festive  and it celebrates the heritage of this great nation  okay unless you actually have one in your car  stop suggesting authentic native american headdress  oh no  oh my god  marshall  lily youre not supposed to see me  holy crap i dont think anyones supposed to see you  what happened did amy do this to you  just the frosted tips i did the rest im sorry baby  ive ruined the whole wedding havent i  oh no you didnt ruin the wedding sweetie  it was already ruined  theres no flowers no photographer  oh and scooters here by the way  yeah i know i heard  my veil got thrashed the harp player is in labor  and im not wearing my wedding underwear  what no property of marshall across the back  how are people going to know whose butt that is  what happened  remember the wedding we wanted the intimate outdoor ceremony  i wish we could have that wedding  so do it  what  get married now  right here  look its outside like you always wanted  intimate close friends  theres no guitar but its pretty close  barney can officiate  yes yes i can  uh excuse me guys you all dropped something  your jaws  because barney stinson is about to aid and abet a marriage  could we even do that i mean what about all those people in there  do that one too and then when everything goes wrong  you wont care because you already had the real wedding out here  what do you think baby  i love it  me too  lets do it lets get married before we get married  great  wait hold on  excuse me sir  could we borrow your hat  okay  thank you  hat  we thought of authentic native american headdress  before we thought of hat  thank you all for coming  for those of you who dont know me  im not the biggest believer in marriage  but you two are so great together you know  its like you were uh made for each other   hes gonna cry  no im not  im not im not im not im not im not  lily and marshall  when everyone sees you they  see true love  its the best love  can we just um move on to the rings or something  oh no  i dont have my vows  i dont have mine either  you dont need your vows just say why you love each other  okay ill go first  lily  there are a million reasons why i love you  you make me laugh  and you take care of me when im sick  youre sweet caring and you even created an egg dish and named it after me  she puts a little italian dressing in scrambled eggs before she cooks them  its called eggs marshall and its awesome  but the main reason that i love you is  that youre my best friend lily  youre uh youre the best friend i ever had   im sorry buddy  no problem  its totally okay  my turn  oh thank you  marshall i love you because youre funny  and you make me feel loved  and you make me feel safe  and for our anniversary you gave me a sweatshirt that says  lily and marshall rockin it since 96  i kinda wish i was wearing it right now  cause it smells like you  but the main reason i love you marshall ericksen  is you make me happy  you make me happy all the time  hey i found your panties  im good  marshall do you take lily to be your wife to have and to hold from this day forward   slow down  i cant  from this day forward so as long as you both shall live  i do  lily do you promise to take marshall to be your husband to have and to hold live  i do  okay then  by the power invested in me by the very bitter old pakistani man  who works down at the courthouse on lafayette street  i now pronounce you man and wife  you may kiss the bride   do you smoke  no  wow first lie of marriage that was fast  after that we all went back inside for the second wedding  and yes a lot of things did go wrong  but it didnt matter  because when i look back on that day  what i remember is the first wedding  the intimate outdoor ceremony  with just close friends  and an acoustic guitar  how do you feel  tired i got married twice today  so where do you want to do it for the first time as a married couple  nice hotel room or a reception hall bathroom  what do you think  bathroom of course  please dont   sorry ted  sorry ted
