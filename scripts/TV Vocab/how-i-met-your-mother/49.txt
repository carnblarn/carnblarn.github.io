choreographed dance  it was late august 1996  lily and i were both freshman moving into  hewitt hall  and she needed some help setting up her stereo  for some unknown reason  i felt drawn to room 110  as if she knew  that someone very special was behind that door  and as fate would have it that someone was marshall  it was love at first sight  aw  i know right  now they perfected that story over hundreds of tellings  the first time marshall told it to me  it was a little different  dude this blackhaired goth chick stopped by today  want to tap it  you guys are so lucky  you know when ted and i were cooking  and our hands touched for the first time  i knew right then that after class  he would take me up on the roofkiss me and give me a rose  which he did  say aw  aw  i know right  ill get

   what youare over your hand issues  its about time      here call me  and even though that girl ended up giving me a fake number  i knew that ted and i would be each others wingmen forever  barney its time you knew  um that story actually goes a little bit differently      great funny  god with a wingman like tedi might need to resort  to meeting someone in a superdesperate and lame way  like online  online  online  oh my godyou told them  okay yes i told them  but its not a big deal  lots of people meet on the internet  that whole scene a stranger across a crowded room thing  that only happens in the movies  yeah that never happensoh wait except you and robin  thats how you guys met right    wait you guys dated  for how long  a year  but dont worry  the relationship wasnt that good  by the end it was mostly about sex  which was not that good  but i was the problem  id just lie there  ted is uhvery good  im sure he will get you where you need to go  can i buy your bags online  oh oh i see whats going on here ted  im just some random girl to make robin jealous  and after she takes you back  you probably wont even remember my name  come on blahblahits not like that  well were closing in the half  lets see how blahblah is doing on the crazyhot scale  she started the night herebut as the nights progressed  shes gotten crazier but no hotter  which has caused her to drift across the mendoza diagonal  and dangerously close to the shelly gilespie zone  another girl i dated  she gained 20 pounds and tried to kill me with a brick  im sorry i didnt tell you but seriously  theres nothing going on with me and robin  then why has she been trying to undermine me all night  i mean look at her  shes laughing at me right now  im sorryits just you know  lily and marshalls story is so romantic  i just wish we had something like that  well their storys not as magical as it seems  what do you mean  no i i cant itsits kind of a secret  well how about i tell you a little secret  about what you might get to do later tonight  the night before lily met marshall  there was this party    you a freshwoman  i never use the word freshman  sexist  yeah im a first year  im in hewitt 220  no way hewitt 110  you should totally come by  maybe i will hewitt 110  chug chug chug  chug chug chug  chugchug chug  look at these drunk idiots  hey dont drink their two dollar beer  this is a pinot noir  from europe  oh its fruity  yeah i cut it with some cranberry juice  it was pretty strong  do you have a girlfriend  yeah  not sure about the whole long distance thing though  its like descartes says  in order to determine  whether there is anything we can know with certainty  we first have to doubt everything we know  you know  but as drunk as she was when she woke up the next morning  she still remembered room 110  thats why she knocked on the door  she was looking for me  oh my god  yeah and in all these years  lily and i have never even spoken about it  so again mums thword okay  you have to tell marshall  no if if he heard that it would destroy him  if you dont tell him  i will  oh come on you wouldnt  so lilyhow did you and ted meet  come on lily the real story  i dont think anyone wants to hear that story  aw dont be embarrassed tedit was a long time ago  and i made a huge mistake last night  but its like descartes says  in order to determine whether there is anything  we can know with certainty  we first have to doubt everything we know  and i now know for certain that i love you karen  anyway call me back when you get this  im also going down to the computer center  to send you an electronic mail  ted  this is lily  no no im sorrybut i love karen  yes that is the unabridged story of how lily and i met  how embarrassing  who wants another round thats not the story  ted tell em  tell us whatum lily  will you help us get the next round  ted whats going on  she knows about usabout how we really met  yeah i knowi just told her  no the real story  ted what are you talking about  lily come on  come on what  lily come on  ted i honestly dont know what youre talking about  lily come on  i know that you and ted made out  the night before you met marshall  what  ted and i never made out  yeah we did  i only made out with one other guy in college  before i met marshall and it was just some random dude  i i dont even remember his name  i just call him too much tongue guy  what too much tongue guy  well im not surprised to hear that  coming from unreasonably small mouth opening girl  that wasnt me  yes it was at the freshman orientation party  no no no no no  no no  no no no no no  how much fun is this  all of us reminiscing about how we met me  robin have i told you how i met marshall  uh yeahlike five or six times  it was right over there  heres your problem  youve only slept with one woman  those kind of stats are only okay if youre 11  but tonight  were getting you a new girl  becausemarshall eriksen  from this moment on i make all your decisions for you  im sorrywho who are you again  this is barney i met him the other day  hes kind of a jackass  im teaching ted how to live  and lucky you i have room for one more student  think of me as yoda  as yoda only instead of being little and green  i wear suits and im awesome  im your bro  im broda  and tonight  youre going to use the force  to get the hottest chick in this bar into bed  hes going to use force  cause that sounds wrong broda  no the force  its a star wars reference  so we should make lots of star wars references around girls  thats what youre saying  im not going to cheat on my girlfriend  yes you are with the hottiest that just walked in  look at her  how much hotter is she  than your girlfriend  theres no comparison  what do you think ted  no should i go for it  dont do it man  i mean think about lily  you know what i dont care  ive been with one woman for too long  i need me some strange  pep talk  you can do this  but to be more accurate you probably cant  youre way out of practice and she is way too hot for you  so remember tonight isnt about scoring  its about believing that you can do it  even though you probably cant  go get em tiger  poor guys going to crash and burn  that man is a god  for like a week after  barney followed me around  asking me to teach him how to live  i even got him to do my laundry once  i thought it was a mrmiyagi kind of thing  marshall i need to talk to you  can we go somewhere in private  yeah of course whats wrong  lily and ted made out  what do you think of that robin  what are you talking about  you know that guy i made out with  at the freshman orientation party  too much tongue guy yeah  and you know that girl i made out with  at the freshman orientation party  unreasonably small mouth opening girl yeah  im too much tongue guy  and im unreasonably small mouth opening girl  worst superheroes ever  oh baby i am so sorry  i dot think you need to be  i was at that party  it was dark and granted  i had eaten quite a few sandwiches but im 100 sure  that unreasonably small mouth opening girl  was alexa leskeys not lily  really  yeah im positive  and too much tongue guy was colin oreilly  are you sure  if it wasnt  i peed in the wrong guys shampoo man  you dont really believe that do you  you swore it was lily  i guess i made a mistake  must have been alexa  another girl ted  who havent you made out with  you know what i dont need this  i design handbags im writing a memoir  im a superstar this is totally my year  someday the name blahblah will be up in lights  and ted next time youre online  playing world of warcraft  dont even think about chatting with me  world of warcraft  the online  roleplaying game  thats how you two  met online          yeah its a reallyits a cool game  so suffice it to say  blahblah did not turn out to be your mother  and as for the girl i made out with at the party  there wasnt a doubt in my mind that was your aunt lily  but you know that magical story  of how she and uncle marshall met  it was worth preserving so i kept my mouth shut  i guess i made a mistake  must have been alexa  until our 20th college reunion  when i ran into alexa leskeys  so ted remember the last time we were here  you and me  no idea  ted come on  freshman year we were both pretty drunk  that was you  lily we never made out  i know  so i am not too much tongue guy  actually  look what ive confiscated from some kids  that is a fat sandwich  i know right  chew chew chewchew swallow  oh thats all righthoney  sandwiches are strong these days  i cant believe i used to be able to eat  a whole sandwich by myself  now its like two bites and i am done  baby can we grow sandwiches behind the garage  dude were 42  wwwheres my wife
