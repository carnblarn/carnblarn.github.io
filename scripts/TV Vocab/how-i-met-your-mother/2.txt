                okay where was i  you were telling us how you met mom  in excruciating detail  right so back in 2005 when i was 27 my two best friends got engaged  and it got me thinking maybe i should get married  and then i saw robin  she was incredible  i just knew i had to meet her  thats where your uncle barney came in  i suggest we play a little game i like to call have you met ted  wait no no no were not playing have you met ted  hi have you met ted  so i asked her out  and i know this sound crazy but after just one date  i was in love with her which made me say something stupid  i think im in love with you  what  oh dad  so then what happened  nothing  i mean id made a complete fool of myself  so a week went by and i decided not to call her  so youre not gonna call her  you went from i think im in love with you to im not gonna call her  i wasnt in love with her okay  i was briefly in love with the abstract concept of getting married  it had absolutely nothing to do with robin   robin  hi  look who i ran into  since when do you guys know each other  oh since about here  lily recognized me from the news and  hello sailor  they just got engaged  well i should get back to the station  see you guys   nice seeing you ted  yeah you too   dawn it  what   im in love with her  no  as your sponsor i will not let you relapse  you blew it its over move on  i dont know i just have this feeling shes the future mrs ted mosby  lily you squeaked  she said something about me didnt she  come on spill it red  fine  so what do we think of ted  teds something else  huh  im gonna spin that as good  lots of guys are something im something else  comes on a little strong  but thats part of my charm  but thats part of his charm  oh totally i mean hes sweet hes charming  hes just looking for something a little bit more serious than i am  i mean the most i can handle right now is something casual  this just stays between us right  are you kidding  this flapper fort knox  oops  she wants casual  okay ill be casual  im going to be a mushroom cloud of casual  you know why  cause its a game  i want her to skip to the end and do the whole happilyeverafter thing  but you dont get there unless you play the game  so are you going to ask her out  yeah no  i cant ask her out because if i ask her out im asking her out  so how do i ask her out without asking her out  did you guys get high  i got it  i dont ask her out  i invite her to our party next friday  were having a party next friday  we are now  casual  yeah cause nothing says casual like inviting a hundred people over just to mack on one girl  oh and lily thats my leg  you waited five minutes to tell me that  all right so call her up  no callings not casual  i just got to bump into her somewhere  now if only i knew
