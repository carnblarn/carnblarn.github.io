microbrewing   or head down to staten island  to spend it   with my super religious cousin  stacy in her family   so i opted  for none of the above   and decided  to spend christmas 2006   in manhattan   celebrating  with my other family  okay i have one last paper due at 500 pm today  so until then i will be at the law library at school  but im not to be disturbed for any reason  dude
