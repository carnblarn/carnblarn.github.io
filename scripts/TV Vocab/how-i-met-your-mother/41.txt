                it took me a while to figure out  but the key to understanding your uncle barney is this  when times are hard its impossible to keep him around  like when your aunt lily and uncle marshall were broken up  hey what are you guys talking about   lily  i got to go  but when times are good its impossible to get rid of him  what are you guys doing  we just finished planning marshalls bachelor party  good you havent started yet lets talk logistics  now have you laid out ground rules with lily  where you are or arent allowed to touch or be touched  show me on ted  actually were uh were thinking of skipping the strippers  you you want to have a party without strippers  this was the worse thing i could have said  you see uncle barney loved cooking up bachelor parties  and it was always the same recipe  you start with a slightly cramped hotel suite  arrange the chairs in a circle  fill them with your closest friends  turn the heat up to about 90  pump in a metric ton of cigar smoke  and then right in the middle of the room you throw in a girl  but not a beautiful girl  no if this girl was ever beautiful it was two kids  three tattoos and one pesky substance abuse problem ago  which one of you is stuart  please i really dont want to do this  shut up put in your mouth guard  then she proceeds to do things that demean the groom  herself and really the entire human race  disgusting  ah horrifying   classic  oh please please no no  i dont want anything like that happening to me  stuarts still trying to forget that night  its my bachelor party were not having strippers  oh he thinks he has a sain it  so strippers it is  now just uh tell me where were going to be and ill make some calls  i think i can get the fourth one for free  quick question prosthetic arm deal breaker   barney there is  before you say no it has attachments       look i know you have some stuff planned for marshalls bachelor party   but he really doesnt want strippers  yes he does   uh well he told me he doesnt  uh well he told me he does   when  every minute of every day  as his inner animal thrashes against the cage of his own puritanical upbringing  or do you guys not like naked girls  um we love naked girls  theyre one of the best things in the world  it goes naked girls democracy  the scene in every which way but loose where the monkey gives a guy the finger   we just dont like your naked girls  what my girls arent hot enough  i mean all right fine the stripper at stuarts bachelor party was a 15   she was 15  no a 15 like in blackjack  as in not sure whether youd hit it   exactly  nice  this is important to marshall so promise me no strippers  all right i promise   im serious  so am i no strippers  now say it without winking  no strippers   you just winked  no i didnt  so when the day arrived we all climbed into a rented escalade and set out  now every bachelor party is usually made up of the same stock characters  youve got the groom  the best man   the guy who speaks only in clichs  dead man walking  the guy who disappears at the beginning of the night  and doesnt show up again until the end  all right whos up for a little blackjack before we check in   no no no  none for me  see you guys back at the room then  and of course well barney  every bachelor party has a barney oh whats this  this car has a dvd player you mean  we could have been watching

many times as robin told this story over the years  she would never quite be able to explain the logic of her next move  is this a strip show or a kiss concert  shh shes starting  please turn off your cell phones pagers and sense of shame  all right boys lie back get comfortable and enjoy the show  of course theres no way im telling you about her show   so lets skip ahead a little  ow  oh my god

show  not to use the smoke machine when shes on the hippity hop  now im going to have to spend the rest of my bachelor party in a hospital  well hey maybe well get to see her xrays  the ultimate strip show   xrays more like triple xrays  just stop  which exit is the hospital  what if she doesnt make it to the hospital  barney please calm down  maybe we should just take her to the desert  bury her and wash our hands of this whole thing  dude what is the matter with you  im just trying to illustrate to marshall that as his best man   youre not my best man  as his best man  i would help him bury a hooker in the desert   im not a hooker  and youre not my best man  youve ruined my bachelor party  i dont know why you wouldnt just listen to me when i said i didnt want this  well the fight started ten minutes ago maybemaybe we should listen  oh doctor what a fight  that knockout will be talked about for years to come  anyone lucky enough to be in the arena tonight  just witnessed boxing history in the making  thank you so much margaret i cant believe you carved that crucifix yourself  so talented  didnt think you could carve  for you oh and this ones from   grandma lois  oh no wait darling  before you open this ii want to say a few words  okay something you need to know  grandma lois thought she was giving her granddaughter an antique sewing machine  and were back in  honey this handy little device has been in our family for generations  i used it your great grandmother used it  now her mother didnt use this one but she used one just like it  of course back then they were made out of wood  and uh i guess before that you just had to do it by hand   would you pass the wine please  no  hey marshall  while were here you may as well go down to the morgue and  climb into a drawer cause thats what marriage is like  can i get an amen   is everything all right at home stuart  no  its broken  oh damn it this is bad i really cant lose this job  my daughters are about to start school and my fianc well  ever since he got back from iraq pretty much all he does is drink  i think about leaving him but  i dont want my girls growing up without a dad like i did  i dont want them to know what thats like   so show time  what is the matter with you  her ankles broken  i know for a fact that the second half of her act  takes place largely in a seated or supine position  oh thats true  treasure please dont worry about the show  uh wed feel bad  what does that mean  no we just mean uh youre off the hook  you dont have to do it  i dont have to do it well guess what  i know i dont have to do it i do it because i am good at it  look i dont need your pity  all i want to do is give you a great show because youre getting married  is that so much to ask is that such a major inconvenience  oh that is wrong  oh thats just so wrong  well the doctor did say for her to keep it elevated  when i was a girl my mother taught me and my sister to use it  we used to have contests to see who could finish faster  it was so exciting the whole family would gather around to watch  and when i was a new bride this is what kept me buzy  all those long nights when your grandfather was in korea  and speaking of your grandfather  though i dont think hed care to admit this to any of his army buddies but  hed have a go at it every once in a while  and he enjoyed it  oh open it up sweetie  may this give for you as much joy as its brought me  grandma um  wow  well take it out honey i want to show you how to use it  okay no no dont take it out  lily thats not your grandmas gift its mine  i panicked and i switched the cards because i was embarrassed  well what is it  its just like the one miranda gave to charlotte on sex and the city  oh i love that show i always watch it on tbs  oh you would youre such a samantha  oh im a carrie youre a samantha  and then the night became a whole new kind of uncomfortable   so where do i get one of these  mom  man what a show huh  she did some disgusting stuff really sticks with you  i may be done eating  me too  i mean like forever  me too  i miss my wife  hey lets go around the table and say what our favorite part was  mine was that thing with the typewriter  i mean she made some spelling mistakes but still  ooh and you guys were all barney put out the cigar  its a nonsmoking room and i was all hell no this is a cuban  of course eventually i did put it out  did i put it out  i put it out  did i put it out  i put it out  did i put it out  it was a small fire not even big enough to force an evacuation of the hotel  but definitely big enough to get us kicked out  and bring marshalls bachelor party to an early end  is that  it is  hey guys  how was the fight  hey what are you guys doing here what happened to the bachelor party  we missed the fight dinner was ruined  we spent half the night in the hospital and got kicked out of the hotel   what do you think happened  barney barney  hey i was just trying to be a good best man  you know what a best man does barney he does what the groom wants  but all you ever think about is what you want whats best for you  best man  im not even sure im inviting you to the

here for one more second  i bought you a ticket home  marshall is one of the best people i know  and it wont be long until someone else realizes that  and youll lose him forever  i cant stand the thought of that happening  and i cannot keep stealing chicks from him forever  never ever tell anyone i was here i will deny it tooth and nail  this trip never happened  hey if you had three hours to
