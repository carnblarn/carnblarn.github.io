                kids the thing about new years eve is that it sucks  sure it looks great on tv  but in reality its always just a big let down  but in 2005 i attempted to do the impossible  to give my friends a great new years eve  i had an idea of how to do it too  and all it cost was half my christmas bonus  yeah thats right a limo  oh man ted this is great  okay people lets talk strategy  last new years we went our separate ways and it sucked  this year we party together or not at all  now i sifted through your party submissions  and i narrowed them down to these five  question  yes barney your submissions were received and no  we will not be attending any parties in your pants  but you enjoyed the evite right  thas an actual picture of my pants  yeah  we will hit all five parties before midnight  and then narrow them down to one  the most awesome party in new york city  and that is where we will ring nay rock in the new year  all right and party number one thats where we get to meet mary beth  mary beth  oh she works in my office  she seems like she might be into me  shes always finding reasons to hug me  so tonight  people often ask me barney how is it that youre so psyched so much of the time  by who  who asks you that  and the answer is right here  my own personal get psyched mix  now people often think a good mix should rise and fall  but people are wrong  it
