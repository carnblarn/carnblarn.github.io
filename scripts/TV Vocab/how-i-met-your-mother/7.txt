nine million people in new york 45 million women  of course you want to meet somebody roughly your own age  lets say plus minus five years  so if we take into account the most recent census data that leaves us with 482000  but uh wait 48 of those are already in relationships  and then you have to eliminate half for intelligence sense of humor and compatibility  and then you have to take out the exgirlfriends and the relatives  and oh we cant forget those lesbians  and then that leaves us with eight women  that cant be right eight  really eight  there are eight fish in that big blue ocean ted  and if you feel confident that you could reel one in to your boat without me  theres the door  do you take credit cards  okay its back and this time we got a good look  hey seriously you have to stop doing that  its bigger now  its been feeding  we were just upstairs watching tv  oh gosh  okay lets do this  shh shh shh  its okay  its over  oh god  so did you get a good look at it  yeah it has six legs a hard exoskeleton like a roach  but it had mouselike characteristics  greybrown tufts of fur a tail  so which is it a cockroach or a mouse  its a cockamouse  what  its some sort of mutant combination of the two  its as if a cockroach and a mouse you know  did the horizontal tenlegged interspecies chacha  thats impossible that simply cant happen   oh but it can  and it has  and its pissed  dude is everything okay you left the front door open  there was no time  so love solutions  did you meet the love of your life  she said itd take three days its been five days  should i be

hi i uh meant to call you  the computer is still crunching the numbers  busy as a bee that little computer  you said it was going to be three days  did i  three days really  yeah and when someone says youre going to meet the perfect woman in three days  you kind of put that in your date book so  how do i say this this is going to be really hard  ted there are absolutely no women out there for you  phew actually i got through that okay  therere no women out there for me i thought you said there were eight  i know there are supposed to be i dont know where they are  but im an architect and you

messing with me right  come see for yourself  i cannot set you up unless you have a compatibility rating of 70 or higher  and look 54 48 56  theres a 96 right there  dont touch the computer  yes sarah obrien  i fixed her up six months ago she would have been absolutely perfect for you  well what about the guy you set her up with is he a 96 compatibility rating   so he sucks  no 85 is an extremely good matchup quotient  oh sure its good  its solid but a 96   ted look i have a lunch  please i promise we will find you somebody dont lose hope  there are new women turning 18 every day  its a whole new species the cockamouse  and its the size of a potato  so what now its a cockapotatomouse  dont make it sound ridiculous its a cockamouse  my god this is incredible were like the same person  sarah obrien loves brunch she wants to have two children  her guilty pleasure song is summer breeze by seals and crofts  wow ted sounds like youre her perfect woman  and like the majestic seahorse its hermaphroditic  obviously the whole thing is shrouded in mystery  for as much as we know about the cockamouse  theres still so much we dont know  well we know that theres no such thing as the cockamouse  what we dont know is what you guys have been smoking  so you really dont believe in the cockamouse  well i believe that you saw something perfectly normal  but youve exaggerated it in your mind you know  like the loch ness monster  if by like the loch ness monster you mean totally exists and is awesome  then yeah its like the loch ness monster  its diet is not unlike our own grains cereals and its awfully fond of cheese  okay this is getting weird the similarities go on and on  she hates phonies i totally hate phonies too  shes a dermatologist i have skin  you want to be her boyfriend she already has a boyfriend its uncanny  all right  but it wouldnt hurt to check her out right  see what my 96 looks like in person  as you know a frame of reference  and if she thinks she can do 1145 better who am i to deny her that  thats right i did the math  hi  hi im dr obrien  im architect mosby  sorry i just wanted to say my job too  hi im ted  hi so what are we doing today  right i uh i have a kind of mole on my back  its probably nothing but im a cautious guy  im exactly the same  summer breeze makes me feel fine  blowing through the jasmine in my mind  sorry about that  summer breeze is my guilty pleasure song  its been stuck in my head ever since i heard it this weekend  at brunch  i love brunch  its the best  as long as i dont have to spend it with a bunch of phonies  i like the way you think architect mosby  hey this may sound weird but itll definitely sound more weird once my shirts off  so im going to ask you now  do you want to have dinner with me

and there were eight fish in a sea full of lesbians and  okay ted ted  do you honestly believe deep down that there is no one else out there for you  just because some computer says so  i didnt used
