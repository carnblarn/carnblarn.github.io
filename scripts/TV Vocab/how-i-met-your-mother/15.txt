there was this barefoot dude with weirdly sharp toenails  oh come on ted you know what story i want to hear  everyone else here has manned up tonight and told the truth  why cant you  youre right  victoria im sorry i havent told you this yet  but a while back i was kind of into robin  in fact on our first date i might have said i love you  understandably she freaked out and i left  but unfortunately the night did not end there  we all ended up at the bar with our cab driver ranjit  to one hell of a night  and i drank a lot  so you guys think i should have kissed her  well ill tell you what im gonna go kiss her right now  yes do it  to the cab  hello  is someone out there  you ralphed and ran  i thought you were vomitfree since 93  so that was a lie  you rereturned for me  thats really sweet  though you kind of ruined my customized scherbotsky doormat  sorry  its okay  victoria i know this must be  yeah it kind of is  wow ted you were right you shouldnt have told that story  but you did earn yourself the right to the end of mine  we fastforward eight years into the future  wait eight years thats thats this year  marshall not only is it this year its tonight  hi  barney  hi shannon   what are you doing here  just listen  when you left me for that guy greg it changed me  now im this  ii know this is crazy its just you were once such a big part of my life  and it just seemed insane that you didnt know who i am now  so here i am  and then she told me about her life  she and greg dated for a while and then split up  but heres the real kicker  shannons a mom  she has a little kid named max  thats crazy  that could have been my kid  but instead what do i have  my whole lifes some money in the bank some suits in my closet  and a string of onenight stands  hey come on  i mean just because her life went one way and yours went another  it doesnt make your life any worse  my life rocks  money suits and sex these are tears of joy  i could be cooped up in some tiny apartment changing some brats poopy diapers  but instead im out in the world being awesome 247 365  you let me dodge a bullet big guy  plus heres the minicherry on top of the regular cherry  on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life  after shannon and i talked i nailed her   nope  yeah   nope  yeah  sorry dont buy it youre making it up  youre just trying to cover the fact that you actually had  a profound moment of doubt about yourself and   oh my god  oh barney  videos pretty good on this phone huh  is your phone on  oh no it just takes a while to power down  ew gross just stop it  ladies gentlemen ted  this has been a wonderful evening  i got great dirt on all you guys  i got ted to tell the rereturn  i finally nailed shannon  told her id call her tomorrow yeah right  and i rediscovered just how awesomely awesome my life is  peace out hombres  i think barney just won game night  we spend so much effort trying to keep parts of our lives hidden  even from our closest friends  but those rare times when we do open up  its amazing how minor those secrets all end up seeming  of course not every secret was told that night  but thats getting ahead of the story
