                 so i guess that decides it  yup  hanging out at a coffee place  is not nearly as much fun as hanging out at a bar  man whats that  what  that cute coffee girl wrote a heart by your name  somebody has a crush on you  somebody thinks youre me  do you really think she likes me  i mean i guess  its not that surprising  every time i come in here i totally crack her up  marshall heres your pumpkin latte  wow how did you fit a pumpkin in this little cup  ill have a pumpkin latte  how do they even fit a pumpkin in those little cups  what you got a shrink ray back there  yeah  hey remember that time i said that thing  about how do they fit a pumpkin into that little cup   which time  the first time  yeah that was really funny  right  all right theres only two reasons shed laugh at that  one its the first joke shes ever heard  or two she likes you you should totally ask her out  you think  yeah that why youre not back with lily right  so you can experience what its like to be single  well what if the heart doesnt mean anything  what if she writes it on all the cups  mine says ted no heart  mine says swarley  howd they get swarley from barney  its not even a name  who would ever be called swarley  oh please dont start calling me swarley  this would never happen at a bar  man whats up with swarley  i know you almost never see old swarlz get that upset  hey guess what  oh sorry  its only my mom  shes just rambling on like always  what happened  marshall asked out a girl  wow  well if anything thats dads fault  thatll keep her going a while  oh of course you know he had a little help  swarley hooked him up  oh good you got my text   yeah  oh no it was me  i gave marshall one of my secrets   so what she say  nothing  i dont think she heard me its pretty busy up there  what you gave her the look right  head down eyes looking up  hands in pockets shoulders up  head slightly tilted conveying shy vulnerability  i think so  look can we just go  pumpkin latte for marshall  i didnt order that  phone number  i love that look  i think i slept with you because of that look  and its fake  oh and you biting your lower lip shyly looking away  and thrusting your chest out is natural  yeah i hear you   hey  hey guys  are you free tomorrow night  i was thinking of having a wine tasting slash  help me catch the rat in my apartment party  thats a great idea you can put out cheese for both  i should invite marshall right  itd be weird if i didnt  yeah i dont think he can go  really why not  uh okay um  lily we have to tell you something  marshall has a date  oh well good for him  really youre okay with it  look weve been broken up almost six months  i mean im not thrilled about the idea  but he has every right to date someone else  thats very mature  why are you

of the pupils or pupi  no just pupils  its an indicator of future mental instability  she does not have the crazy eyes  you just cant see it because youre afflicted  with havent been laid in a while blindness  she was too far away in the coffee place  but when i saw her up close just now  hey id like you guys to officially meet chloe   hi  hi  hi  its nice to meet you guys  you guys im not going to stop dating chloe  just because you think she has the crazy eyes  you can keep going out with her but youre gonna regret it  one time i met a girl at this very bar  i saw that she had the crazy eyes  but i ignored it  and then sure enough  barney can i ask you a question  anything  would you like to have a threesome  of course  great itll be you me and mr weasels  so did you do it  no it ended up being just a twosome  with the third one watching from a chair  which one were you  id rather not say  look there was a time i didnt believe in the crazy eyes either  and then i met jeanine  she had serious crazy eyes  i told myself i was  just imagining it but then  so should we go get a drink  as long as its in your apartment  whoa im sorry  watch where youre going  so where do you live  you guys chloe is not  gonna do any of that stuff  shes a nice girl from nebraska  shes not crazy  shes shes awesome  but you cant avoid the crazy eyes forever  sooner or later the crazy  comes bubbling to the surface  hello  marshall its chloe  are you the one whos called me like nine times  yeah could you come get me  im in the middle of taking a test  please  im so scared  well whats going on  this weird midget guy started following me  and he was screaming at me  and he had a limp and a big hump on his back  and the police didnt believe me  and i almost got trampled by a horse and  god i must sound totally crazy to you right now  no pfft  not at all  so shes needy crazy  thats one of the worst kinds  ive had one of those  makes up stories to get attention  went out with her for three weeks her dad died twice  guys she was really freaked out okay  maybe the story is true  what in the world would make you believe thats a true story  shes really hot  they always are   you all done with that ted  yeah  ned i told you to call him ned  thats just sad  sorry swarley  so do just you and ted live here  or does swarley live here too  nah swarley has his own place  what was that  oh i uh dropped my keys  so here you go  two pumpkin beers  i was joking theyre regular beers  what is that  this picture is broken  oh thats too bad  is that lily  is  that the girl you were

said you were fine with it  yeah in front of ted but then i shot you a look   what look  this  that doesnt seem like a look  yes it is it means  im upset call me later  you should have pulled me aside and told me what the look meant  if i pulled you aside i wouldnt need the look  well maybe if it was a more distinctive look  okay the look isnt important  whats important is that i cant stand the idea  of marshall dating another woman  i mean what if  he falls in love with her  well if it makes you feel any better  ted says she has the crazy eyes  whats that  apparently a thing women have that guys can see  and it tells them that the girls crazy  oh kind of like how you never want to date a guy  with perfect fingernails  jerk nails exactly  well diddid ted say whether she was goodlooking  i mean cause if i knew she was ugly  then maybe i wouldnt be so freaked out  uh he didnt say but you can find out  i think her name is chloe she works at cosa coffee on 78th  phone call for swarles

wait so you were the hunchback with the limp  yeah  and she didnt break the picture i did  so chloes not crazy shes  just a nice normal girl  yeah she is  and you deserve a nice normal girl  so why dont you just go back up there  andand finish your date  yeah  okay  okay  wait if you were the hunchback then why did she think you were a guy  ii might have used a voice that sounded like this   why  because i didnt want  her to know it was me which  i now realize doesnt make sense  because she hadnt even met me  youre crazy  you have crazier eyes than anybody that i have ever met  shouldnt you be going back up  i mean youre out of your mind  youre just absolutely insane  shouldnt you be going back upstairs  ive missed you so much  okay i ran it by the group  and we decided were gonna give
