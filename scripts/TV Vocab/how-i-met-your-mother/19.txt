dog just got nominated for a local area media award  a lamea  we prefer local area media award  um theres going to be this big banquet  i know these things arent much fun but it would really mean a lot to me if you guys came  and theres an open bar   yes  word up  yeah put me down for two  really its three months away  i know but guys im sorry im going to say it  i have a feeling victorias going to be around for a long time  im going to miss victoria  i should just skip this thing entirely robins still pissed at me after you know  you lied and said you were broken up with victoria before you actually were  so you could try to nail robin and you wound up losing both girls in one night  yes thats what i meant by you know  i havent seen her in three weeks she wont return my calls   look i shouldnt go  you should definitely go  look its a chance to show her youre still friends and that you support her  or its a chance to mess with her head by showing up with someone hotter  even better triple threat hotter and bigger boobs   thats only two  count again  barney im not bringing a date even if i wanted to the things in two hours  so get an escort  by escort you mean prostitute  why not  because gross  oh gross what you have some puritanical hangup about prostitution  dude its the worlds oldest profession  you really think thats true  oh yeah i bet even cromagnons used to give cave hookers  like an extra fish for putting out  aha so then the oldest profession would be fishermen  kaboom youve been lawyered  come on ted lets get you a hooker itll be fun  okay to bring to the banquet and hang out with ironically or to actually have sex with  yes  no its illegal and did i mention gross  thats adorable ted youre such a hayseed  the companionship business is the growth industry of the 21st century  you do realize that one out of every eight adult women in america is a prostitute   you just made that up  withdrawn  lawyered  the point is how long has it been    is that your water may i  yeah go ahead  much obliged    ted you are in a slump  no its not a slump  its an intentional hiatus from girls  a slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the

couldnt imagine you cranky  really i couldnt imagine you cranky  wow why are you so tired  well i teach kindergarten and the school board took away my nap time the kids nap time  lily quit your job  work at a private school you wont have to deal with the school board  and youll make a ton more money  well guess what barney  i dont base all my life decisions on how much money im going to make  unlike you and sadly my fiance  well its just an internship for the record  yeah because if i did sacrifice all my values just for an easy buck  what would that make me  a prostitute  exactly thank you mary  so mary what do you do for a living  shes a paralegal  yes im a paralegal  oh so mary the paralegal  what does a paralegal do exactly  i just assist with daytoday clerical work in a law firm downtown  oh what firm  douglas ohalloran and stamp  thats a real law firm  i know  nice  youre pretty good on your feet  are you flirting with me  is that allowed  yes its encouraged  you know i wouldnt normally say this on a first date but  well considering  im just going to say it you are so hot   well thank you  youre welcome  mary ted is a great guy you hold on to him  dont let him out of your sight for a minute  so sandy what do you do  oh wait i know what you do  youre the guy who reads the paper in the morning  you got me  what do you do ted  oh same thing as you i read the paper every morning  but then after that i finish my coffee and i go to my real job as an architect  where i make an actual contribution to the world  im just kidding love your show youre terrific  thanks  i never tire of hearing that  hey you know that scene in empire where they lower the helmet onto darth vaders head  do you think thats how sandy puts his hair on in the morning  you just insulted someone i hate by referencing something i love  damn you just got even hotter  and so as the night wore on i started to realize  this girl despite what she did for a living was kind of great   hey  hey  mary seems nice  have you kissed her yet or are you waiting  until youre in a serious relationship with someone else  i uh i wanted to apologize for everything that happened  and just like that its all okay  roll credits  so youre going to be mad at me forever what were not even friends now   were still friends  are we  you dont return my calls we never hang out  and now youre trying to make my jealous by waving edward r moron in my face  oh and paralegally blonde isnt here in her lowcut dress to make me jealous  oh so now shes a whore  what  you know something mary the paralegal is awesome  and you know what else i didnt come here tonight to make you jealous  i came here to support you as a friend  and frankly im sick of trying  i like that guy   hey  hey  what were you guys talking about over there  oh i was uh just telling my friend that i think youre awesome  well thanks  you know this is one of the nicer hotels ive ever been in  oh yeah my friend did the remodel  you

those things you have to do before you turn 30  sleep with a prostitute  no lose your virginity what up  statistic men who have had at least one relationship with a prostitute  are 75 more likely to have success in future relationships  you just made that up   withdrawn  lawyered  okay three things first of all robins categorys almost up  and second of all you cannot do this  its wrong on every level  and third ive been placing small items in sandys hair all night he still hasnt noticed  i know i cant do this im not doing this its just its a shame  shes really cool   yeah well there we go  scooter bambam branson for  a bicycle joyride or deathtrap  mike murphy for 13 pregnant and addicted  and robin scherbotsky for pickles the singing dog  and the winner is  robin scherbotsky  thanks

everything so here it goes  marys not a paralegal  shes a prostitute  marys a prostitute  what  barney paid for her  is that true  we were having a conversation about prostitution  and then barney calls her up and then she shows up at the bar  and now she and ted are upstairs  okay seriously what is going on with ted lately  is he having a nervous breakdown  you know barney for anyone else this would be a new low  but sadly for you its just a new middle  oh my god i used her lipstick ah  thats her napkin  no  okay well i guess now is as good a time as any  in keeping with tonights award show motif  id like to announce this evenings big twist ending  vampire lou would you do the honors  marys not really a prostitute  what  thats all vampire lou nicely done   so shes not  no  marys just a paralegal who lives in my building  oh haha and heres the best part  she has no idea that ted thinks shes a hooker  oh come on  if you dont laugh it just seems mean  i feel kind of like richard gere   not shy about your looks are you  no  you know mary ive never done this before  done what  you know been on a date  yeah right  wait youre kidding right  no  why is that so odd  well ted i mean ive been going on dates since i was 15  god you were just a kid  well look lets just have a few drinks well relax and  yeah that sounds great i had clients riding me all day long  must be tough  yeah i mean this one guy just wouldnt leave me alone  i mean talk about anal  well here we are  okay look mary i like you a lot  im sort of amazed at how much i like you but i cant do this  youre a hooker  what  look maybe im oldfashioned but im sorry thats a dealbreaker for me  im not going to have sex with a prostitute  no ted im a paralegal  come on mary theres no one else around  youre a hooker  no ted  im a paralegal  no youre a hooker  no im a paralegal  youre a paralegal  that was not funny  not funny dude  i know it was hilarious  why would you do that  i did it to prove a point  what point  stay with me its going to come to me  no ah okay heres the point  you thought that mary was a sure thing right  so what happened she took you up to a hotel room on the first date  all you have to do is be that confident with every girl you meet  and your slump is over  so the message is i should treat every woman like a whore  come on dude you should be thanking me  she slapped me and stormed off  can you blame her you called her a hooker  im sorry dude it was funny  yeah well its getting late i should get back to my room  your room  yeah that really expensive hotel room you put on your credit card  never checked out  by the way you know whats super fun  pouring dom perignon down a bathtub drain  well its almost 300 got a massage toodles  come on if you dont laugh it just seems mean
