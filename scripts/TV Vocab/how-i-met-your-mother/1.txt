that girl   marshall remember this night  when youre the best man at our wedding and you give a speech  youre gonna tell this story  why does he get to be the best man   im your best friend   as i walked up to that door a million thoughts raced through my mind  unfortunately one particular  thought did not  ive got five dogs  not good not good   no   get back in there   youre wearing a suit   ted   hi  i was just uh  come on up  hes in  so  ranjit you must have done it with a lebanese girl   okay thats my barney limit  im gonna see if that bodega has a bathroom  actually im from bangladesh  the women hot there   heres a picture of my wife  a simple no would have sufficed  shes lovely  so ted what brings you back to brooklyn at 100 in the morning in a suit   i was just hoping to  get those olives  that you said i could have  would you like those olives with some gin and vermouth   are you trying to get me drunk   for starters  so marshall this olive theory based on you and lilly   you hate olives  lilly loves em you cant stand em  yeah hate olives  two weeks ago spanish bar on 79th street dish of olives you had some what up   you have to swear that this does not leave this cab   i swear  i swear  on our first date i ordered a greek salad  lilly asked if she could have my olives   i said sure i hate olives  but you like olives  well i was 18 okay  i was a virgin  been waitin my whole life for a pretty girl to want my olives  marshall im gonna give you an early wedding present  dont get married  i think i like your olive theory  i think i like your new french horn  i think i like your nose  i think im in love with you  what  what  what   come on man you said your stomachs been hurting right   you know what that is  hunger  youre hungry for experience  hungry for something new  hungry for olives  but youre too scared to do anything about it  yeah im scared okay   but when i think of spending the rest of my life with lilly  committing forever no other women  doesnt scare me at all  im marrying that girl  lilly  lilly i like olives  well make it work  so orlando you gonna hit disneyworld   you love me   iii cant believe i said that  why did i say that  who says that   i should just go  hold on  wait a minute  promised you these  olives thanks i love you  what is wrong with me   why are we still sitting here   lets go we can still make last call  what do you say lil   yohoho and a bottle of rum   cause youre a pirate  okay eye patch gone  and we cant just abandon ted  if it doesnt go well up there hes gonna need some support  its been like 20 minutes  you think theyre doin it   you think theyre doin it in front of the dogs   doggy style  hey there was a girl in college she had this golden retriever  okay we can go to the bar just stop talking  hit it ranjit  so when you tell this story to your friends  could you avoid the word psycho   id prefer eccentric  good night psycho  great  um how do i get to the f train   oh um two blocks that way and take a right  you know what   im done being single  im not good at it  look obviously you cant tell a woman you just met you love her  but it sucks that you cant  ill tell you something though  if a woman not you just some hypothetical woman  were to bear with me through all this  i think id make a damn good husband  because thats the stuff id be good at  stuff like making her laugh and being a good father  and walking her five hypothetical dogs  being a good kisser  everyone thinks theyre a good kisser  oh ive got references  good night ted  and im a good handshaker  thats a pretty great handshake  and that was it  ill probably never see her again  what   that was the signal  that long lingering handshake  you should have kissed her  theres no such thing as the signal  but yeah that was the signal  signal  ah carl thank you  something i gotta do  by the way you should have kissed her  carl  you guys werent there  i am so turned on right now  guys trust me  ive seen the signal  that was not the signal  yeah ted were not on you anymore   to my fiance  to the future  to one hell of a night   that was not the signal  i asked her about it years later  and yeah that was the signal  i could have kissed her  but thats the funny thing about destiny  it happens whether you plan it or not  i mean i never thought id see that girl again  but it turns out i was just too close to the puzzle  to see the picture that was forming  because that kids is the true story of how i met your aunt robin  aunt robin   i thought this was how you met mom   will you relax  im getting to it  like i said its a long story
