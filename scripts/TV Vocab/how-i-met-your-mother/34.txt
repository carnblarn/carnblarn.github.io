you  robin went through the usual stages   spider spider  i left something in the hallway   where  right there  got it  first theres the moment when you think you think it  whoa still alive  theres the moment you think you know it  oh you dont want to kiss me youll get sick  totally worth it  theres the moment where you know you know it but you cant yet say it  all right its getting to be that time ill talk to you tomorrow  good night  good night  wait ted  yeah  good night  well great ill see you then  bye sweetie  hey guess what  my sister katie is coming to visit next weekend  she gets

falafel   i totally choked  i just dont get it  why cant you tell ted you love him  oh come on this is a big deal for me  oh god youd think you never said it to a guy before  no  okay well i dont usually get this far in the relationship  i usually take the threeweek exit  dont tell me youre actually buying into barneys freeway theory  watch your steps when you get up kids cause i am about to drop some knowledge  relationships are like a freeway  wait a minute a month ago you told me relationships are like a traveling circus  no this is new this trumps that  freeways have exits so do relationships  the first exit my personal favorite is six hours in  you meet you talk you have sex you exit when shes in the shower  so every girl you have sex with feels the immediate need to shower  actually yeah i get that  the next exits are four days three weeks seven months  thats when you guys are gonna break up mark your calendars  what  then a year and a half 18 years and the last exit death  which if youve been with the same woman for your entire life  its like are we there yet  so ive never been on the freeway this long before  i mean usually by now i find out the guy has some weird personality thing  that makes me want to take the next exit  yeah been there  i once dated a guy who could only go to the bathroom when classical music was playing  okay it was marshall  its just things are going so well with ted i just dont want to complicate it  relax itll happen when it happens  which is also the advice i gave marshall to get him over the classical music thing  oh here comes katie   aw your sisters so cute  yeah  this reminds me of when i used to see her coming up the driveway from school  with her little pigtails and her hello kitty backpack   hello kitty  oh no

out of having sex  yeah i dont have any of those  discouraging premarital sex is against my religion  please im her older sister  im supposed to teach her how to make good and responsible decisions  its 200 and youve already had three scotch and sodas  thats why i need your help  robin convinced katie to stay with her that first night  and the next day i took everybody to the empire state building  you guys are lucky you came here with an architect  empire state building fun fact number one  when construction began on march 17 1930  the framework rose at a rate of four and a half
