                some kids dream of being astronauts  some kids dream of playing baseball  when i was a kid i had only one dream  to build a skyscraper  thats stupid  there were some obstacles along the way  but eventually my dream came true  i became an architect  morning everyone  so i had an idea for the atrium  ready  columns  thats stupid      i i cant believe you knocked over my model  well its just its not exactly new is it columns  i mean whats your next groundbreaking idea ceilings  floors  windows  i know what youre thinking whos this jerk  well this jerk was hammond druthers  a legend in the architecture community  very big in the 80s  he was also far and away the worst boss i ever had  then i designed the spokane national bank building  and suddenly i was his boss   and he didnt like it  stairs  and to be honest i wasnt sure i liked it either  see before when i was just another employee  i was happy carefree  the guy who hung out in the break room making fun of the boss  did you see what he was wearing today  it was like his pants were being held up by his nipples  yeah and that shirt with the flowers i get hay fever just looking at it  but suddenly i was a different guy  hey guys  whats so funny  nothing  um nice shirt  thanks  the hours were insane  i was always working even when i wasnt at work  oh robin i just had a great idea  oh do whatever you want to me just dont wake me up  before i used to be this guy  dude of course you should take the day off for the foo fighters concert  just say youre sick  but now  i was this guy  sick huh  unbutton your shirt  hmm foo fighters  get back to work  but still the worst part was druthers   well i was thinking  ceilings oops  said that already then again you seem to like rehashing old ideas  im kidding of course  another hole in one boss  oh wow he must be really goodlooking  why would you say that  well cause only goodlooking people can get away with saying things like that  i have found that to be true  its a blessing and a curse really  ted you cant let him treat you like that  yeah you gotta ask yourself whos the boss   tony  angela    mona  mona  watch it more closely rock your world  so what are you gonna do  well its awkward i mean the guy used to be my boss  so  i went to talk to the managing partner  fire him  well sir i was thinking he could just be put on a different project  fire him  hes an arrogant washedup pain in the ass  in fact fire everyone on that project  druthers mosby the whole lot of them  mosby sir i i i hear mosbys doing some great work  fine mosby can stay but tell him hes on thin ice  come here  i like you crosby  you mind if i charge my phone  knock yourself out  well ted if you do fire druthers the key is timing  remember when i had to fire my makeup artist  vicki um im so sorry about this  but theres been some budget cuts and um  we have to let you go  i mean after tonight  i still need my makeup for the broadcast  so  our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims  you know what im gonna do it  im gonna fire druthers tomorrow   oh my god  what   do you know about this  no  what is that  only the greatest thing ever  wait wait wait thats not enough buildup  if they were to cure cancer tomorrow  this would still be the greatest thing to happen all week  okay now youre ready for naked marshall  oh my god  this is awesome times

come  how did you know that  because i didnt hide it very well  so  the story on the painting is that back in college  lily wanted to do a nude study for her art class  marshall wasnt so into the idea  well i just dont think that some dude  should drop trou just to pose for you  its for class and its just that weird kid hunter from my freshman hall  the frisbee dude with the soul patch  hes like the hottest guy in school  no hes actually a little husky  oh hes just huggable  and complicated  and a little bit of a jerk  just enough so you think maybe you can change him  okay just forget it  call me oldfashioned  i just think that im the only guy you should see naked  well then youll have to do it  are you kidding me what if somebody sees it  were not in high school anymore  people dont make fun of you for posing nude for a painting  were adults now  we totally saw your butt  this painting has caused too much grief already  im destroying it right now  oh no whats the matter marshall  where is it  ill tell you where it is if youll answer these riddles three  you hung it up in the bar didnt you  yo why you gotta ruin my riddles  field trip  oh no someone put your painting up behind the bar  classic  what a memorable prank  hey marshall whatll you have  whatll i have um i dont know maybe a beer  and that nude painting of me hanging behind the bar  ooh im sorry that paintings

plus ten bucks  i doubt it  all right you know what carl you just lost yourself a regular customer  i doubt it  this painting is the worst thing thats ever happened to me  okay where should we put it up next in his law school  ooh on the side of a bus oh oh  how much do billboards cost  easy scherbatsky finesse  ive got a fiveyear rollout plan  ill have you know that paintings got commitments all

alone in the office  if i was gonna fire him  this would be the best chance id ever have  uh look just a second ted  uh no i i really need to talk to you  look theres no easy way to say  what what are you doing  what are you doing  im standing here wearing pants  are you sleeping here whats going on  okay fine yes  not that its any of your business  but my wife had a little spat a few weeks ago  and ive been sleeping here until she cools off  okay well uh youre right that is none of my business  uh look theres no easy way to say this i  who am i kidding  shes never gonna take me back  its okay  what did you want to say to me  happy birthday buddy  so youve been living at the office  yes   im an architect without a home  you see the tragic irony in that   yeah i do  cause i design homes   i see it  but i dont have a home  not lost on me at all  but i dont understand why dont you just go to a hotel  you could be sleeping on a mattress instead of  what appears to be tornup drawings of my building  why  would i go to a hotel when any second  shes going to call and tell me to come home  shes a very special lady ted  shes quite mannish  she gives me what i need  do you understand that  uh  no i dont  if you were lost in the wilderness  she can provide for me  well thats the dream  im glad you came here tonight ted  me too hammond   call me ham  no thanks   hammy d  no i think just hammond  so im guessing you didnt fire him  i was this close  meanwhile lily had been up all night  in the grips of a dilemma   oh honey youre awake  im awake   is everything okay  yeah  ive kind of been wrestling with something  what if i told you i had a way to pay for our honeymoon  baby our honeymoons already paid for  were going to howe caverns  well yeah but but what if we didnt want to spend our honeymoon in a cave  its not just a cave its a whole labyrinth of caves  its an underground adventure  theres a cave thats so dark that you dont even know youre in there  i mean were going to experience a whole new kind of dark  well what if i found a way to make a little extra money  so that we spend our honeymoon not in howe caverns  but in scotland   loch ness  yeah  and you know edinburgh and the highlands and glasgow  loch ness nessy  baby i would love to search for the enchanted creature of the emerald loch  but we cant afford that  maybe we can  paint me  okay i dont get this  youve been making fun of that painting all this time  and now you want me to paint you  we knew we could torture marshall because he has shame  i do not  in my body where the shame gland should be  theres a second awesome gland  true story  yeah thats not the gland im worried about painting  yeah  a nude barney is a challenge  but i think youre talented enough to immortalize this  now is the time im 31  im at the peak of my physical beauty  if i were a woman id have passed it long long ago  long ago  forget it  i promised marshall he was the only guy i would ever see naked  ill give you 5000  were going to loch ness  yeah  that cabby would not shut up  yeah we should call him a gabby  i think it you say it  hey uh thanks for putting me up last night buddy  give em hell  morning team  so i have given it some thought  and i say we revisit columns  oh god not this again  ted a man in a toga just arrived and delivered a parchment  let me read it  oh its from ancient greece  they want their basic architectural elements back   geez  what  you didnt hear me  toga parchment  can i see you for one second  ooh im in trouble now  what are you doing  i thought we were friends  you slept on my couch you ate my cereal  i tossed you more toilet paper  we are friends   but that doesnt magically make your bad ideas good  what i dont believe this  youre youre youre wearing my clothes  and my girlfriends sneakers  man you have weirdly small feet  ted i hope that youre not going to let our professional woes  interfere with our friendship  because  i really kind of need you right now  okay lets get this over with  hey hey i dont want you phoning this in  this painting could someday become a serious work of art  i mean you have been blessed with an amazing gift  thank you  i meant me  now i like how you captured marshalls essence  goofy and unburdened with wit  but me i want something more regal  something my progeny could look at and say  theres stands barnabus stinson  he was wise  and strong  i dont think your sword will fit  i get that a lot  and so as lily began painting  marshall thought about the 5000  and what his fiance was doing to earn it  this isnt right  this isnt right at all  finally he could take it no more  hold still  hold still   hold still  paint faster  okay i guess its time  drop your shorts  yeah  wait wait  that wasnt enough buildup i need  in a world without justice one man   oh just drop them  all right   no no this is not right  we had a deal  well im going back on the deal barney get out   you  its over  lily i cant let you go through with this  i found a castle we can stay in but its an extra two grand  its just not right  its beautiful and they say its haunted  i cant let the woman i love compromise her values for money  i totally think we can get some more money out of him  im never letting my fiance ever  oh youre still here  before you say anything  ill give you an extra five grand  we accept  you people are so easy to control  dance for me puppets dance  and thats how uncle barney paid for lily and marshalls honeymoon  come on ted listen why dont we get back  and finish drawing the plans for a building  which in my opinion is never going to get built  so you and i can get out of here and grab a couple of beers  no  look hammond theres no easy way to say this but  looking for hammond druthers  oh thats me im hammond druthers  these are divorce papers  youve been served  oh god  shes really going through with this  so thats it its over  there is no easy way to say this but  shes giving me the remains of wolfie  my dog is dead  oh my god i cant believe this  she always played too rough with him  believe me there is no easy way to say this    happy birthday to you   youve got to be kidding me  guys you have no idea how much this means to me right now  wait his birthday was yesterday  yeah but a bunch of us were up at the conference in montreal   so we thought  no no birthday no  i got something to say and im gonna get it out  hammond listen to me i am sorry that your dog died  and that your wife is divorcing you and that  your life is falling apart and that these guys missed your birthday  and there is no easy way to say  what are you doing whats going on  oh god  oh come on youre not going to pull that are you  oh look yeah right now were falling onto the ground  well nice try but guess what  youre fired  youre fired you get it you hear me  youre gone youre fired  in my defense i think we all suspected hammond  might have been faking  on the plus side the emts seem to think hes going to be just fine  and as you saw they did admit that i did not cause the heart attack  even if they said it a bit begrudgingly  and there it was rock bottom  they all hated me  but just when all seemed lost  i had the greatest idea of my entire career  margarita fridays great idea boss  okay its done  im gonna step out so you can admire it  thank you very much lily  marshall do you have the money   yeah  lets get out of here  a smooth area you gave me the ken doll  she left out little barney  barnacle junior  my barnana is  barnito supreme
