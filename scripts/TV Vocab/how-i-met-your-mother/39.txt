                this is awesome  i cant believe this moments finally here  one more mile and my little boy turns 200000  your baby fieros grown into a really old man fiero  and just like an old man  he leaks fluid smells stale  makes weird noises out the back  yeah he does  hey light up those cigars in the glove compartment  theyre real cubans i got em in chinatown last year  just for this moment  uh marshall im not saying you were definitely ripped off  but these are chopsticks wrapped in napkins   what are you talking about  whoa pothole  what no oh no  no no no  no theres only 8 miles to go come on buddy  buddy  is it cool if i still light these      kids sometimes life forces us to be someone we didnt want to be  when that happens we often try to hold on to a little piece of who we were  maybe a tattoo  or a piece of jewelry  a tiny souvenir that reminds us this is who i really am  marshalls souvenir was not so tiny  but the more he found himself being pushed toward the corporate world  and away from his dream of saving the environment  the tighter he held on to that fiero  hey  one good thing were off the hook for the folding party today  hey its very important to both lily and me  that there be a handmade origami crane in each of our weddings  i couldnt even get through it thank god  hey your cars going to be fine  this is the best auto shop around  look at this certificate  one of the mechanics here  finished a 64ounce steak  surprise  we felt bad that you guys were missing  the superfun origami folding party so  we suggested moving it here  we insisted  terrific  hows the fiero  shes still in triage  she i thought it was your little boy  oh it goes back and forth its sort of a tranny car  how long have you had her slash him  my brothers handed it down to me when i was 16  oh how nice of them  not really  congratulations  the fiero is yours  if you pass the final test  come on  i already shaved my legs and swallowed five dollars in quarters

 you have 50 cents  no  look  can i just have my coffee please  sorry were all out of trays and lids  two tall guys just came through here a few minutes ago and bought em all  and that is the origin of marshalls insane  no food or drinks in the fiero not even groceries rule  it is not insane  barney thats like the third one in a row that youve screwed up  well im trying but its  look you fold twice to the middle fold back and forth pull the ends out  flip over open the flaps fold the edges crease the front fold in half  fold the wings down push in the bottom corners and fold the wings back

died because of it   remember the 100k fiasco  ah the fieroasco  dude i told you that doesnt work its the 100k fiasco   whats the 100k fiasco  the fieroasco  it was just before winter break our freshman year of college  marshall and i were roommates but we werent really good friends yet  i thought ted was a little bit pretentious  and marshall was a total slob  hey  im driving my fiero back over break  i know we see enough of each other as it is  but if you want a ride i could use the gas money  you live in ohio right i could swing through and pick you up  all right first of all my parents live in ohio  i live in the moment  plus karen and i havent seen each other since thanksgiving  were both really invested in making this longdistance thing work so  all right well call me if you change your mind  my odometers going to hit 100k  shed be so bummed if i left early  it was totally mutual  i mean karen brought it up first but i  it was it was totally mutual  i hear you  so whats up with you and lily anything serious  yeah  dude were college freshmen  im not going to get tied down by the first chick i hook up with  lilys cool but this bird youll never chain you know  the next few hours of our drive were classic road trip  so this song  oh its the best song in the world  its the only song i like  just kidding  tapes been stuck in the player for like two years  better than nothing though  maybe  i am so sick of this song  dont worry it comes around again  what do you mean   just to be the man who walks 1000 miles    and falls down at your door   yeah we totally nailed the ending  that was probably our best one  hey you want to  play zitch dog   what  uh its a car game  every time you see a dog you got to be the first one to say zitch dog   im pretty good so

whos not fun enough now karen  then we got lost  where the hell are we   im pulling over  no keep driving  were almost out of gas and we might not even be on a road anymore  its below zero out if we pull over we could be snowed in for days  plus i only have like six granola bars and three bottles of water   nah i threw them out  what  no food or drink in the fiero  no food or drink in the f you havent washed your sheets since  thus began the longest night of our lives  pretty sure that my foot is frozen solid  marshall  theres a very real chance that were gonna be snowed in here for days  if i die first do whatever you need to survive  eat my flesh  slice me open like a tauntaun whatever  thanks ted  youre a good friend  and if i die first you just leave my body alone  what  i just said you could cut me open and crawl inside me  yeah dont do any of that stuff to me it skeeves me out  but but youre dead and im gonna die if i dont  wasnt an easy decision  this is all because of your insane nofood rule  its perfectly rational  hey my spectacles  hey  i know were low on gas  but can we turn on the heat for just a minute  okay  d ude  i hate to say this  but its so cold  theres only one way that were gonna make it through this night   we shouldve kept driving  come on marshall  no no we might die now  i may never see lily again  i never told anybody this but  ive known for a long time that im gonna marry that girl  if we survive this someday im gonna marry her  im sorry about your spectacles  thats okay  they were decorative  hey marshall  y eah  are you still thinking about lily  yeah  please stop   and so marshall and i thought we were gonna die out there in the middle of nowhere  but funny thing  hey you lovers better just keep on driving   zitch dog  damn it  you said you were gonna marry me that long ago  that is so sweet  that trip is when marshall and i became best friends  with privileges from the sound of it  e riksen  wow  looks like he really needs a hug  ted  he said it would be at least  and even then theres no guarantee  well its a pretty old car  yeah you can keep prolonging its life  but its really mostly machine at this point  i know that its a lot of money  but its my fiero you know  im about to graduate and take some sellout corporate law job  and without that fiero im just another guy in a suit   how dare you  hey  ive been through so much in that car  the suicidal cat  hitchhiking waldo  the homeless guy who broke in through the window  and threw up all over the backseat  lily dont  be strong do not go all prisoners dilemma on me  the cars on its deathbed robin i have to clear my conscience  guys what are you talking about  okay shortly after we met robin  she and i were jonesing for thai food from this one place  an hour and a half delivery we cant wait that long  i wish we could take the fiero but marshall has this insane nofood rule  but thai food lily  pad yum mao  tom kai gah  thai see ran  oh youre just saying random syllables and it still sounds delicious  okay heres what well do  well drive over pick it up have them doublebag it  very carefully drive it back here with the windows open  and hell never know  wow these brakes are really sensitive  oh marshall is gonna kill me  this and the difference between affect and effect are the only two things  hes really serious about   lily its gonna be fine  no its

theres two in the glove compartment but hes been saving them  hand me those chopsticks  hey how about some tunes  oh great song  these cigars arent helping at all  yeah this was a terrible idea  now it just smells like a homeless guy threw up in here  the broken windows  we had to make it look realistic  why did you break two of them  it looked like fun when she did it so i wanted to try  cant believe this whole time it was you guys  ive been blaming really tanned dancing leotard guy  marshall im so sorry but sharing that secret  thats when robin and i became best friends  wow what a special car  so can i crush it into a little cube yet  i dont know i dont know i dont know  come on marshall  this is your fiero  you know the right thing to do here  wow barney why do you love that

had two accidents if you add the fact that he   umminahumminahumminahummina umminahumminahumminahummina  i shouldnt even be here thanks to that deathtrap  but fate  fate gave me a second chance  and helped me realize that our days on this planet are too few to squander  so i decided from that moment on  to continue living life to its fullest  so you made a lifechanging decision to not change your life at all  true story  guys  this fieros meant a lot to all of us  friendships were made  adventures had horrors faced  thats why we have to get rid of it   yes  what  its lived a great life and it deserves to die with dignity  but 200000  but thats life you know  you never end up where you thought you wanted to be  im not helping the environment  teds not a philosopher  lilys not not a worldfamous artist  barneys never driven more than ten miles an hour  robin im sure has also experienced disappointment in her life  maybe  and my fieros not a fiero that went 200000 miles  its okay you know  those are old dreams  well get a new car and well fill that one up with new memories  and thatll be the car we had when we were first married  when we owned our first house  maybe even the first car our four kids remember  thats so sweet  the first car our two kids remember  i would like to say goodbye  you know what   this fiero its effected all our lives   affected  thats what i said  just making sure  got us all a lot of places  i mean maybe its time we return the favor  this fiero should have made it to 200000  so lets get it out that door  and well push it the last 7 miles  itd do the same for us   hey geniuses  the back wheels are on blocks that car aint going anywhere   close enough  close enough  and so marshall said goodbye to his fiero  and as the cars final gift to us all  the money he got for scrap parts paid our bar tab for the next two nights  arrivederci fiero  you  were the freaking giving tree of cars  may you rust in peace  rot in hell devil steed  and what better friend is there than that  bro have you heard this new song  i just got the cassingle  put it in  i am never going to get sick of this song  never ever never never ever  yeah
