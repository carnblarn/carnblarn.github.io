                kids sometimes your relationship  goes so smoothly for so long  that you think it will be  that way forever  it never is  well we just had our first fight  we had our first fight  oh no whatd you fight about  oh no whatd you fight about  a few months ago  my architecture firm was approached  to design this new building  its this big skyscraper  in spokane  itd be a huge project  for his firm  and if we dont get it  we could go under  so anyway the head architect  unveils his new design  to the whole company   no  no  yes  all skyscrapers  kind of look like a  marshall  its a 78story pink marble tower  with a rounded top  and two spherical  entryways at the front  wow so its the whole package   yeah you did  had to  oh dude if theyre selling condos  you got to get me in  and dont give me the shaft   yeah you did  had to  its a travesty  its gonna define  the skyline of the city  if it was me i couldve  designed something amazing  instead im spending 12 hours  a day designing the cornices   yeah you did  that wasnt one  so you and ted  had your first fight  it obviously ended well  i mean youre here with me  actually  it didnt end at all  i started getting bummed out  so i came here  its what i do  when my grandma died  i got a perm  ooh two tragedies in one day  the thing is  ted has been literally  complaining about work  nonstop for weeks  so when i came over today  i was kind of done   hey  hey   how was your day  good  wow youre a great interviewer  arent you gonna ask  how my day was  no i know how it was  it was awful  ooh you want to rent  a movie tonight  you know um  i listen to your work  stories all the time  yeah but  and i dont want to be rude here  but my work stories  are interesting  im a television news reporter   robin  what  i knew exactly  what he was going to say  i was just helping him  get there faster  you should work  at a suicide hotline  and then it got ugly  what i dont do is tell you  the same story over and over again  i mean you wouldnt  watch the same movie  over and over again would you  maybe a great movie  like die hard  but field of dreams  once is more than enough  so thats your goto bad movie  the number one example  on the tip of your tongue  of a bad movie is  field of dreams  its about  ghost baseball players  i think its stupid  so now hes all mad at me  about the stupid movie  robin hes upset because  you wouldnt listen to him  not because you didnt like  some movie  how do you not like  field of dreams  listening is the foundation  of a relationship  and if hes really droning on  you can always practice  saying the alphabet backwards  you know in case  you get pulled over for a dui  i guess i dont know  how to do that  yeah its really hard  even when youre sober  thats what i tried  to explain to the cop  no i mean i guess i dont know  how to do this girlfriend thing  ive  never been in a relationship  this serious before  i should probably go tell him  im sorry shouldnt i  youre trying to do it right now  arent you  what the hell comes before q  then at the end of the movie when  he has a catch with his dad like  like he never did when he was  young enough for it to matter  can we talk about something else  you know what dude  forget about robin okay  youre hanging with us tonight  ive got an awome party lined up  oh god  this gonna be another one  of your weird allguy parties  that was a poker game  what is wrong with you  no its the first law school  party of the year  and its gonna be awesome  i havent seen this guys since  like last year  before lily and i broke up  so im gonna have  to break the news to everybody  its really gonna bum them out  this partys gonna suck  well love to join you at that one  but i got tickets to foxy boxing  i wish i could join you guys  but i got to get back  to my apparently boring job   your jobs not boring  robin thinks so  dude lots of chicks  think architects are hot  think about it  you create something out of nothing  youre like god  theres nobody hotter than god  i love it when you quote scripture  im telling you you should use  the architect angle with the ladies  okay first of all  i have a girlfriend  second the architect angle  doesnt even work on her  and third i cant imagine  that working on anyone ever  thats cause youre always like  ted mosby architect  if it were me id be like  ted mosby architect  anything sounds impressive when  its said with the right attitude  marshall ericksen  recently dumped  and heading to a lame party  whoa whoa ladies  please take it easy  theres enough of me for everyone  oh hi hello  all right were gonna take off  wait up ill leave with you guys  ted mosby architect  trust me  hey just out of curiosity  if a guy told you  he was an architect  what  would you think of that  are you kidding  architects are hot  how do you think mr brady  scored a babe like carol  solid point  she did have hair of gold   yes she did  mmhmm  hey carl is ted still here  no  hey lily   you still single  yes  you know ive poured a lot of  free drinks for you over the years  a lot  carl do you really want  to be with a woman  who would trade sex for beer  only if youre into it  its on me  thanks  i wonder where ted went  ted mosby the architect  actually yeah  oh he is such a cool guy  he was here earlier  and what made you decide  you wanted to become an architect  well you know soul of an artist  hands of a master craftsman  it was inevitable i guess  i bet you can draw cant you  you should draw me  well i could try but you might end up  looking like a midcentury trilevel  hey if you want my friend marshall  invited me to this party we could all go to  marshalls great  hes just a lawyer  but somebody has to push the paper  around for us creative types   am i right  yeah  he asked her to a party  oh my god are you okay  okay its awesome  its a winwin  ted got to vent  and i dont have to hear it  maybe after hes done with  the talkietalk hell come over  and ill get the fun part  what is wrong with you  god i feel like im teaching  love as a second language here  okay you know how when  he tells you boring work stories  youre supposed to listen  well when he picks up  some random girl at a bar  youre supposed to freak out  im not freaking out  because in my mind shes fat  shes a kickboxing instructor  her ass looks better than my face  all right well swing by the party  now the party was for  some of marshalls classmates  from columbia law school  who by day were some of the sharpest  and  most serious  young legal minds in the country  by night however  damn these are some  drunk almostlawyers  okay seriously  who wants to shave my ass  that guy went on to become  a supreme court justice  okay where are  the guys and the hooker  yo whats up ladies  welcome to the party yeah  just need you to sign  this release protecting the host  from any and all responsibility  should you harm yourself  or a third party  then freakin rage yeah  hey drunk legal dude um  have you seen marshall ericksen  he was with a guy named ted  you mean ted mosby the architect  man what a visionary  yeah they were here  awards are nice  they look good on my shelf  but none of that acclaim means  anything compared to the joy  of seeing the sun rise over  your first building  wow  i would love to watch  the sun rise with you  i know you would  its the job  dude you should let us  shave your ass tonight  no way  hey marshall wheres lily  i didnt want to ruin the party  for everybody this early but uh  everyone take a seat  um lily actually called off  the wedding this summer  to go to san francisco  so  were broken up  her name wasnt on  your lease was it  cause if not new york state law  youre not obligated  to give her half the deposit  when you move  yeah  thats not really the part  i was worried about guys  and dont forget the precedent set  by smith v rosenblatt 74  any personal effects she left  in your house or dwelling  become yours after 30 days  guys can we cease and desist  with the lawyer speak for a minute  love died  the love that made you all believe  in love thats dead now  you should sue her  uh really on what ground kara  on the grounds of shut up  thats our attorney general  see marshalls still hung up  on our breakup  why because i listened to him  it was a strong  and nurturing relationship  that i threw away like old gum  not that im worried or anything  but um back to the sun rising  over ted and uh oh  what tasteful way did you describe her  the girl with the smackable ass  yes  thats the young lady  so i know the bouncer  at this techno club posers  do you feel like dancing  yeah okay  there is no way ted went dancing  ted hates clubs  hell yeah i love clubs  i mean i was going to design  a cathedral tonight  kind of take a whack at the whole  relationship between god and man conundrum  but sure lets go dancing  wait let me just check  with my friend  okay  hey marshall you up for  some super loud repetitive music  that hasnt changed  since the mid90s  um only always  lets go  dancing  he went dancing with this girl  okay maybe this is a little bad  dancing is bad  dancing leads to sex  did you grow up  in that footloose town  im calling him  im telling him that i was wrong  and im sorry and i totally want to  listen to his stupid stories  yeah think of another way  to phrase that and youll be fine  hes not answering  calling marshall  hello  marshall hi its robin  can i talk to ted  oh robin hi  um no teds not here tonight  hes uh hes

have you know  i composed a lovely form letter  for use in just such an occasion  just fill out her name and then  something with a a  a a  ill just put resident  go go go go  robin took a long walk that night  she thought about how opening  yourself up to another person  usually means opening yourself up  to going a little crazy  she thought about how much easier  it was just to be alone  and then she came to see me   and i am nothing of a builder    but here i dreamt i was an architect  hey  hey   what are you doing here  i brought donuts  and i dont want to brag  but theyre filled with jelly  thanks  so uh how was your night  it was fine nothing exciting  how was yours  you really want to hear about  boring architect stuff  yes i do  im sorry about earlier  to tell you the truth i never  even saw all of field of dreams  i fell asleep half way through  what the best parts  the last 20 minutes  well maybe they should have moved that  part up a little bit earlier cause  you know what um  what im trying to say is  i love being the person  you bitch to  so how was your day  mr architect  oh i like the way  you say that  hey you want to see  the building  that will make every man  in spokane feel inadequate  obviously   wow  yeah  you know you didnt mention  all the foliage around the base  if you trim that back  the rest would look bigger  you dont have to tell me  and um just for fun ive  ive sort of been working on my own idea  of what i think the building should be  what do you think  you know that time we went to spokane  and i pointed out that skyscraper  that was the first building  i ever designed  and that night was the first time  i showed anyone my first drawing of it  wow  ted this is amazing  thanks  its not like it will ever  come to anything  i dont know  it might come to something  you know girls find  architects very hot  okay  but i dont want you expecting   dear resident  the time we spent together  however long it was  meant the world to me  i would love to see you again  but unfortunately i cannot  you see i am a ghost  i cant only materialize  once every decade  on the anniversary of my death  i chose to spend my one day among  the living with you  sweet resident  perhaps we will meet again  in another decade  provided you keep your figure  until then all my love  from the beyond  barney  barney  who the hell is barney
