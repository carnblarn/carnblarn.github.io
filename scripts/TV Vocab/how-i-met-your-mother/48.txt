show this friday how cool is that  oh does she know that one song  mmmm chaka mmmm chaka  whats that song called  oh right its called every reggae song   i am not irrelevant  what  i ran the numbers  if lily and i have sex twice a week  which lets be honest we all know is being conservative  and weve been together for ten years  plus 17 more times on the honeymoon  minus the twoweek drought when i said the checker at the grocery store  reminded me of a young lily  then we have had sex a total of   wait for it  nice   my mom called once  but thats more times than barney has ever had sex  and to your point ted lily is a quality girl  i win lawyered  doesnt count   it totally counts  youre right it does count  it counts as one youve had sex once how was it  i still matter  okay ted go win the bet  you have my blessing shes a wonderful girl  i should know  oh okay ok i see what youre doing  weve never shared a woman have we ted isnt that funny  youre with her now i was with her a year ago  you figure for her thats like 200 showers ago  youve got to ask yourself ted is 200 enough  you know what  i dont mind  no of course you dont mind  just like the second guy to climb mount everest didnt mind  getting all the way to the top only to find sir edmund hillarys flagpole  thrust into its supple peak  no im sure when youre with her ill be the furthest thing from your mind  kissing what ive already kissed  nuzzling what ive already nuzzled  going blubbering on what ive already gone blubbering on  barney im not afraid of catching your cooties kay  really teds not afraid of cooties  okay well then i guess youd have no problem   having a sip of my gin and tonic  fine  and i only stirred that with my pinky  guess who loves robin  kids kids love robin  doug thinks im pretty cool  really thats great you and george all thanks to me  yeah im going to have to break up with him   what  well its just  its getting a little bit too serious with the kid  you know its just not what im looking for  so better i break it off now before he gets too attached  what  i hate to tell you but  too late  he drew it in class today  oh crap  theres no way thats a picture of me  that woman has on hoop earrings i dont even own hoop earrings  i have one pair and theyre gold those are fruit loops  you are so in denial right now  and youre doing what you always do in relationships  the second you get close to a guy you want to bail  okay granted hes six but the point stands  well well ask the guys  theyll tell you thats not me  thats totally you  wh you guys are crazy  hey who drew the picture of robin   its not me  youre joking right   its not me  my new mommy  kind of has a nice ring to it  hey now that youre a mom are you going to start wearing  those totally awesome jeans that go right up to your boobs  do you guys really think this is me  honey its you  and if youre going to break up with george  you have to break up with his kid too   really  yeah you cant just abandon him  you have to talk to him  come on robin you know its the right thing to do  oh man  doug was right you are a pain in the ass  so i had a really nice time tonight   me too  yeah  hey ted pucker up all you want but i was here first  from this spot i also launched an expedition  to those two large ridges down there  ted  something wrong   hey doug  are you here to see my dad  hes taking a shower  actually i came to see you  i wrote a poem do you want to hear it  sure why not  to my new mommy  you are pretty  you are nice   and you smell like daisies  aw that is so sweet  even though it doesnt rhyme  look uh doug  theres no good way to say this uh  aunt robin didnt know what to say  this kid has never been dumped before  but then she realized  this kid had never been dumped before  she could use every clich in the book  we need to talk  i just think um we both could use some space right now  its not you its me  look i know this hurts but you deserve someone better  im just really trying to focus on my career right now  you know  i just hope we can still be friends  hi  im brooke im here for my date with george  you must be the babysitter  i had so much coffee earlier i need to run to the loo but hey dougie  what the hell was that  that was my new mom  so this picture is not of me   why would i draw a picture of you  wha  how many dates has she been on with your dad  two  ive been on like five and you like her better  we just really connected  and what about me  you think i just go around pouring cereal for every boy in town  why are you getting so upset roberta  robin my name is robin  like the bird remember  whatever  so thats it huh   look youre great but  yeah  theres always a but  well i couldnt do it i broke up with her  thanks a lot by the way a beautiful sexy girl  and all i could think about was you being there first  you were stuck in my head like a chumbawamba song  which chumbawamba song  well what an interesting turn of events  it looks like im going to win  what do you mean win you couldnt even talk to her  you tried and you got slapped  thats what you think happened  okay great rule 1 no eye patches or props of any ki  heres the deal my friend just got dumped so hes a little shy  but hed love to buy you a drink and get to know you  the problem is he thinks a pretty girl like you wont go for a guy like him  so would you slap me across the face so he can see youre not into guys whod feed you lines  what do you say for my friend  you are so sweet  so now whatever nice things ted does for her in her mind  im the guy whos even nicer than him  so you never slept with her  not even at all  wow thats good  it gets better  remember teds phone conversation  well have fun in yoga  well   i am  sorry  stacey right  yeah oh youre teds friend from the bar right  wait dont tell me you go to yoga here too  i do  she plays bass in a reggae band  and then im going to head out to a reggae concert  im a huge fan of reggae  oh my gosh  i play in a reggae band  no way  i wonder why ted didnt tell me about that  like i said im a huge reggae fan  well i should go inside  after a while crocodile   see you later allig  see you later allig  we are two peas  wow well take care  um namaste  you are a sociopath  and that was my yoga mat  so now with ted out of the picture im going to swoop in  and win the whole thing  why  parce que jai le jeu mes chiennes  translation  cause i got game bitches  no no this doesnt prove anything because  hold on a second  its stacey  hey stace  what happened  he did not  stay there ill be right over  i shouldve just worn that stupid eye patch  oh i cant believe you got dumped by a sixyearold  whatever hes a stupidhead  im just im done with kids  of course robin eventually made her peace with kids  and as you guys know  she went on to appear in some very important works of art  yours  hey  you know i really appreciate  how cool youve been about us taking things slow  since ted you know i  i dont really want to get physical too fast  thats what makes you so special baby  anyway i am so psyched to be playing sunsplash tomorrow  we go on sometime between 1100 and 600  so you probably want to get there before 900 just to be safe  oh and its gonna be muddy
