if i may direct your attention to the television  you are about to see something amazing  and then in 72 mickey mantle rode my cab for the fourth time  come on baby bring it home  but the most exciting moment  that would have to be this one right now  what  look at me im on tv  i never thought id have my story told  thank you miss robin trubotsky  thank you  and right then aunt robin realized how important her job truly was  its an honor to tell your story henry  you know metro news one may not be number one in viewership  but this reporter takes pride in whoa oh  oh my god im covered in horse crap  oh my god its in my hair   you planned that  no marshall  that was beyond my wildest dreams  so if you ever come to alabama  my mom throws the huge crawfish boils  and shes just dying to meet you by the way  look natalie theres something i have to say and uh theres no good way to say it  i want to break up  i dont think youre the one for me  i dont want to waste your time because i really like you  i want to do right by you and i think the best way for me to do that is just to be honest  im sorry  oh god just let it out  theyre only tears  im not the one for you  im sorry i just iii thought the mature thing to do   its my birthday  yes i know  i didnt realize  its my birthday and youre telling me im not the one for you  its really not such a big deal i mean the odds  its like you lost the lottery  oh so dating you is like winning the lottery  no no no no i didnt mean that   okay so whats the problem  i i i cant explain it   try  its ineffable  im not effable  no no no no ineffable ineffable means it cant be explained   oh so im stupid  oh god whats going on  okay whats going on is you broke my heart over my answering machine on my birthday  waited three years for me to get over you  tracked me down begged me to go out with you again  only so you could dump me three weeks later again on my birthday  no itsitsits not like that   im just itsitsits  what  im just like so busy right now  remember when natalie said  i have my krav maga class in half an hour  turns out krav maga is not a kind of yoga  its a form of guerilla street fighting developed by the israeli army  this is compliments of those two gentlemen at the bar  my knee  its in my hair  but isnt nice to know people are watching  oh my god are you all right  what happened to you  i told the truth  turns out the truth has a mean roundhouse kick  oh man  oh well you did the right thing   im proud of you  im bleeding internally  hey ted you know what always picks me up when im down  other peoples misfortune you missed something so amazing  please can we just have one person in this whole bar who didnt see it  fine  are you okay  i really thought i was doing it the good way this time  i guess there is no good way  sometimes no matter how hard you try to do the right thing  you just end up flat on your back  flailing around in a big pile of horse crap   you saw it  my phone gets the internet now  and thats how it ended with natalie  no happily ever after just a whole lot of hurt  and just like that all those wonderful memories were replaced by this one  but you know bad as that night was  within a year natalie was married  and now she has three beautiful children  so thats the upside of hurt  sometimes it happens for a reason  so you got beat up by a girl  is that all youre taking away from this story  you got beat up by a girl  hey she knew krav maga
