get them upstairs  come on guys itll be great  well come in after you guys are asleep  and ill be gone before you wake up  so you get to have sex and we get to wake some skanky girl up in the morning  and kick her out  god lily  some guy just told her that he loved her then pretended to go to the bathroom  and never came back you cant make her a cup of coffee  real nice      i put all your heavy jackets in this box marked winter  and all your colorful sweaters in this box marked bill cosby  make fun but america loved that guy for a reason  wow  almost done  not so fast  take your sword  wow   end of an era  yeah  its a bummer to break up the set but youre going to need that sword  its true my building is infested with dragons  looks like our little boy is finally moving out  it seems like just yesterday he was a cute little freshmen  discovering reggae and ultimate frisbee  he did it later than the other kids but we never pushed him  we knew hed get there  you havent moved in yet have you  good you guys have to take this quiz  i found it in a magazine  its called the are you ready to move in together quiz  well if its anything like youre are you wearing panties quiz  im out  question one  ted do you want to move in with robin  mm yes  oh you got the first one wrong  the answer is no you secretly want to be single  and hang out with your awesome friend barney  question two  robin do you think you can score a hotter guy than ted  correct the answer was awkward silence  question three did i just make up this quiz to prove a point  yes  yes i did  really you mean its not from old yellow legal pad magazine  so we all agree  we move teds stuff back up here  mm no were still moving in together  why this is crazy  ted youre throwing your life away this girl is blinding you  with her shiny hair and her boobed shaped boobs  this is bad for you too you know  how are you going to feel when he sees you without any makeup  im not wearing makeup right now  holy crap youre beautiful  all right then how will you feel when you cant sneak the occasional cigarette  oh come on robin doesnt smoke  wait do you  of course not why  dont tell me how to live my life  ted i cant let you do this  come on this is happening  so instead of fighting it why why dont you just help   you want me to help you  yeah  okay ted  ill help you  cant believe we actually got him to take a box down  maybe hes finally getting on board  wheres the truck  wheres barney  wait for it  i cant believe this everything i own in the world is in there  except for this box of pot lids  and the sword  im going to kill him i swear to god im going to kill him  right maybe ill just hold on to that for now  marshall we live alone  this is so great  we can finally do all the things we always said we wanted to do if we lived alone  oh i know what i want to start with  so here we are right  sitting around the apartment naked   awesome  yep  its not as awesome as i thought it would be   my butt itches  im cold  i noticed  yeah like youre one to talk pointy  barney i dont know if you got my other 47 messages  but if my stuff isnt here within the hour im calling the cops  this is the last time im calling you  because my chargers in the back of the truck  dont worry its barney hell bring the stuff back  no its just i was really looking forward to settling in you know  maybe setting up my tv  watching a movie in bed  what  do we really want a tv in the bedroom  i thought we did  im not sure that we do  well where else would we put my tv  we could just put it in our storage unit in the basement  but wouldnt we miss my tv   would we  yes we would  weve had that tv for a long time  and we would feel more at home if it were setup in our bedroom   we need wine dont we  yes we do  should we um move this to the bedroom  why  ted doesnt live here anymore  we can do it wherever we want  you know what else  we dont have to be quiet anymore  we can be as loud as we want  okay i think we need to lay down some ground rules  just because we can be loud doesnt mean we have to be loud  and although it might turn you on  you screaming im the best doesnt do much for me  well its a lot better than yelling teds not here over and over again  well at least what i said is true  well that was unnecessary  well since i only have one box i figure i might as well unpack it  mm where do you think we should put it  well unless you have a separate pot lid room i was thinking the cupboard  what  uh the thing is my kitchen is kind of small  and um i already have a bunch of pot lids  and mine come with pots so  youre saying theres no way to make room for the single box of stuff  i try to move into our place  well why dont you just take it down to the  do not say storage space  i was going to say dumpster  damn it robin this is all i have left in the world  eight pot lids and a sword  yeah about the sword  hello  put on the suit mr mosby  barney i know its you wheres my stuff  its not

didnt ted  why is that  because i didnt want to go back to robins without my stuff  false you know what i think  i think you spent one day with her and it already sucked  i think you didnt like being there she didnt like having you there  and you both realized that you made a huge mistake  and thats why you spent your first night living with robin  out playing laser tag with me  and thats why three seconds ago  you didnt call it my place or our place or home  you called it robins  you know what  you can keep my stuff   hey  hey did you get the truck back  no  why not what happened  oh he pissed me off so much i left  anyway i just wanted to come back here space out and watch a movie  do you anything that wasnt made by john woo  why do you  you know forget the movie i just want to sit  what  its just i eat at that table  fine ill take my shoes off  you know why dont you just throw me down in the storage space  where you have room for me   ted come on  no you come on  i had to jump through hoops all night for barney  and then it took me an hour to get home because his place  is so far away from the bar   oh my god  what  i know where barney put my truck  lets go back to my place  i bet you my place is closer  here we are  you live in the loading dock behind the bar  i dont live here baby this is just my ride  no no no no im not getting into any van  ive seen silence of the lambs  oh my god were drinking champagne in the back of a moving van  why yes sara yes we are  those other rockettes who called you slow are crazy  oh my god i knew it youre kidnapping me   help help  no no no no  i can explain  hello  enjoying the ride  ted ted you let us out of here you let us out of here this instant  this isnt ted  but i hear that guys awesome  so i took sara home and i took barney to a bar near his apartment  apparently that strategy had never occurred to him  that poor girl mustve been so confused  yeah  well at least barney learned a valuable lesson  you do not want to get scissor kicked in the groin by a rockette  so uh i guess we should get you unpacked  yeah  yeah i guess we should  lily deep within the amazonian rainforest  there is a type of tree that only grows around the body of an existing tree  it cannot survive without this tree  it is supported  by this tree  lily we are that tree   the inside tree or the outside tree  the outside tree   shouldnt
