sucks that you came back from argentina with someone as awesome as gael  and i know i have no right to be upset at you  were broken up life goes on whatever  but you know what wewe never did this

winter ill grow it back out  okay im done  i know it was weird showing up with gael  im sorry  look us breaking up it was the right thing  but it took some time to get over you you know  iim still getting over you  but you you were over it the minute they started the inflight movie  over it  my first three days in argentina i cried my eyes out  i missed you so much  i wanted to go and prove how adventurous i am but the truth is  it was really lonely  and thats why gael happened  you werent trying to win the breakup  i was trying to survive it  see look that all sounds good  and well still be friends and move on but  did he have to be so hot   the guys an adonis  hes not an adonis  hes the cadillac of rebound guys marshall has a crush on him   the guys perfect  hes not perfect  oh come on

towards me  go for barney  hey man its marshall  check your email sent you something   what is it  just a new web site  slapcountdowncom  what does this mean  mamarshall  no  no
