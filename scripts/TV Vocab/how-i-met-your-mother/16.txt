thinks im a humble sheep shearer from killarney  ted do you remember in college when lily did that summer art program in paris  yeah  well she kept talking about this cheesy french guy gabriel  so i went out to visit and there was this party  and who shows up but gabriel  and hes got this weakass thin french moustache  im not much of a fighter but i knew i could take this weird little dude  so i took him aside and i got all creepy quiet  i got the crazy eyes going and i said  you stay away from lily  or i swear to god ill eat that moustache right off of your ugly french face  yeah yeah he literally ran away  i think he was crying  i never told lily about it  to be honest im not very proud of it  to be even more honest i am  um other than confirming a lot of european stereotypes about americans  did that little story have a point  yeah the point is that even though lily is my soul mate  long distance still almost killed us  if you think that theres any chance that victoria is your soul mate  you should ask her to stay  well i dont know if she is its still so early but yeah she could be  oh please you barely know this girl  whats her favorite color  is she a cat person or a dog person  is she open to a threeway  ted i do more research than this before buying a cell phone  and fyi yes i have threeway calling  look she cant be a cat person im a dog person im attracted to other dog people  are you sure  all right  hello  hey random question how do you feel about cats  cats hated the musical love the animal  good to know um okay goodbye  shes a cat person  i dont know this girl at all   oh excellent well take this one  yes  whoa hey hey its my suit shouldnt i be the one to choose  here play with this pin cushion  god  im going to look hot  marshall i cant let you waste a suit this nice  fighting a losing battle for our planets survival  this is a suit for winners  i am getting you an interview at my office  we need good men like you in our legal department  we get sued a lot  no way the kid does not sell out  oh come on dude three months working with me  youll make more than lily makes in a year  no ive made my decision  so have i  if i ask this girl to give up her dreams for me and two weeks later its not working out  im like the biggest jerk of all time  its just too much pressure on a new relationship  im going to tell her to go  and so i met her that night to tell her my decision  all right ive been thinking a lot about this  okay wait before you say anything  i wanted to give you this  this is what happens when you you know let them finish baking  i want you to stay  everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal  its like shopping in barneys mind   oh good luck baby  bye  now what sort of dress did you have in mind dear  nothing too huge oror poofy  im not really a girlie girl  but i would like to look like a beautiful princess  i saw a couple up front that were nice  by the window  no offense dear but those are a little out of your price range  where does she get off she doesnt know how much money i make  oh these women are experts  they can guess your net annual income just by looking at your underwear  damn you old navy and your reasonablypriced threepacks  at least we get free champagne   and cake  mmhmm  speaking of which victoria have you decided  what to do about your doughnut fellowship  you know i dont know  i mean i want to go but i dont want to lose ted  i even thought about long distance as if that ever works  ugh all talking and no sex kill me now  i know it sounds lame but i actually think that ted might be the one  thats pretty hard to walk away from  well i dont know  id feel a little stepford turning down a huge opportunity  to chase some guy id only known two months  but this isnt just some guy  this is ted  hes amazing hes the best guy i know  yeah in america but german guys whew  i would let them bread my schnitzel any day if you know what i mean   i really dont  sex  oh excuse me maam this bastards kicked  thanks   oh  oh  its okay guys i hate it   just horrible  its bad its really bad  short in front long in the back  that is the mullet of wedding dresses  you know victoria marshall and i did long distance once  in college i did an art course in paris  i was the only american there  it was really lonely  i only had one friend gabrielle  she was kind of homely and strangelooking  and she was really selfconscious about this little moustache she had  anyway halfway through the semester she just stopped talking to me  and i never figured out why  and then i had nobody  the only thing that got me through was knowing  that my soul mate was back at home waiting for me  if teds your soul mate then it may be worth it to hang onto him  but how am i supposed to know if were soul mates  its too soon  ooh speak of the devil  hello  hey random question how do you feel cats  cats hated the musical love the animal  a cat person why am i not surprised  bye  why does ted want to know if i like cats  maybe hes going to buy you one  i did hear barking in the background  maybe he was in a pet store  does he want us to get a cat together  maybe hes using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying  that is low  do you really think thats what hes doing  oh i wouldnt even wait to find out  i would be on the next plane to germany   aw  aw  oh god you guys are sucky liars   ugly ugly ugly  i dont know what to say  you know what were doing this all wrong  i am going to get you one of those front window dresses just for fun  are you okay  im fine  okay  just kind of seemed like youre trying to hustle victoria out of the country  im not im just trying to support her  she got a superimportant dessert scholarship  stop being sarcastic it is a superimportant dessert scholarship  wow thats hard to say without sounding sarcastic  look i know youre not victorias biggest fan  but she seems to make ted happy  so think about that before you use your miles to buy her a plane ticket  somebody say beautiful princess  oh my gosh its perfect oh  this dress is totally going to get me laid on my wedding night  oh look how happy she is  you know ive always thought of myself as one of those independent women  who would never let any guy mess with my career  and now im actually thinking about it  i feel guilty like its unfeminist or something  i know what you mean  you do  well im always putting my career ahead of my relationships and  to be honest theres a lot of lonely nights in that job description  see thats what im afraid of  choosing ted over your career doesnt make you unfeminist  maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together  robin  i think that you are the coolest  im so glad that were friends  oh no way youre the coolest  no you are  okay i am  im going to stay   aw  aw  oh i am so beautiful  oh dont tell me how much it costs  just snap my neck now so i can die this pretty  wow you look incredible  oh okay okay how much is it on a scale of never to never ever  never ever ever ever ever times infinity  well its okay  you know what makes a bride beautiful  is that shes just happy to be getting married  oh guys i know i look amazing  but the important thing is that marshall and i love each other right  yes youre right  but also you just sat down in the cake  but you know what  its going to come out because its only chocolate and raspberry  okay come on get up let us see how bad it is  it was like this when i found it  and how will you be paying for this  credit card s  i wanted to give you this  this is what happens when you  you know let them finish baking  i want you to stay  i have to go to germany  youre going  yes i have to  so thats what you decided  well no i mean i actually came here tonight leaning toward staying  but when you just told me to stay it made me realize that i have to go  what is this opposite day or something   no  so it is  ted weve only been dating for two months  i cant let you make this decision for me  i was totally going to tell you to go but then you gave me this cupcake  and it reminded me how great you are  well is there any chance that you would move to germany with me  well thats just crazy  oh okay  so its fine for me to make sacrifices for you but for you its crazy  but you have a job here and a life id have nothing there  youd have me  weve only been dating two months  oh its not fair its not fair that we have to break up  i hate this  so were breaking up  i guess so  i guess so  god that sucks man  im so sorry  it was just too much pressure too soon  i mean maybe it was silly to even think  yes marshall i see your new suit and its awesome  well thank you for acknowledging it  it was weird that you hadnt  look i understand that you guys had to break up eventually but why today   shes leaving tomorrow  yeah but shes still in town  yeah she shes still in town  yeah so you spend one more amazing day together  ted think about it this way  if you knew that you were going to lose your leg tomorrow  would you sit on the couch and cry about it  or would you run and jump  and do some awesome air kicks while you still could  awesome air kicks huh   new pajama bottoms  you know it  so we can sit around and cry or we can run  and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off  wait so were sharing the leg  no the leg is a metaphor  how could the leg be well enough to do awesome air kicks one day  and yet still so sick it needs to be chopped off the next  i dont know ted  come on weve had a good run why end on a fight  well what would you want to do  lets do all the stuff we talked about doing and never got around to  like go to the mets  yeah well walk across the brooklyn bridge  see some monkeys at the zoo  go to that frenchvietnamese place we keep passing and say we want to try  wow we better get going  yeah big day  yeah  and kids thats exactly what we did with our last day  the museum the bridge the restaurant  and all of those nice things  lily you have to tell him that dress cost a fortune  no im just gonna wait for the next time marshall really screws up  and then ill just slip this in and it wont seem so bad by comparison  well heres hoping he cheats on you  yeah but only like second base  look at us two guys in suits  you feel that slight tingle  thats every girl in the bar wanting you and every guy wanting to be you  actually its mostly me but youre getting some of the splash  hey babe  dollar beer night so i splurged and got us each our own  so have you thought more about coming to work for barney corp  oh please your company is not called barney corp  yet  oh i almost forgot sergei sent me your bill  b barney this says 4000  i thought you said that it was onethird price  yeah must be a 12000 suit  oh well guess youll have to come work at my company  you set this up you set this whole thing up  i most certainly did  well it wont work  even if i have to get two extra night jobs ill pay your precious tailor  im not selling my soul  baby i know that this will make things harder but i will make it work i promise  i destroyed an 8000 wedding dress  what time is the interview   dont worry i know a guy  im glad we got to spent the day doing awesome air kicks  yeah i was almost too tired for all the sex  im going to miss you so much  im going to miss you too  hey you know i mean if when i get back were still single we can  even if were not  okay  look i know it never works for anyone but do you want to try long distance  yes yes   we can beat the odds  odds schmodds  its gonna work  were going to make it work itll work  it didnt work  longdistance was and is a terrible idea  a really terrible idea just awful  but more on that later
