charming little bed and breakfast  it was so nice  what did you do this weekend  go come on chug chug chug  ten seconds  suck it losers  you know quiet time with the fianc  i dont know i just felt embarrassed  claire is my age and she and her husband do all this classy grownup stuff  maybe we should start doing some grownup stuff  thats some pretty grownup stuff we did this morning  yeah but it wasnt classy  maybe we should have a winetasting party  i like wine  i like tasting  you know i can party lets do it lets rock it maturity style  and ever since then shes been signing him up for book clubs cooking classes  all the things you do when you know where your next thousand lays are coming from  so no lily and marshall will not be joining us  got it anyway ted part two of my story  my friend kellys going to be there  kelly who supposedly im going to love  oh you are going to love kelly shes fun shes smart she lives in the moment  translation shes ugly shes ugly she ugs in the ugly

spilled gorgeous all over it   love it   thank you  and his hair was perfect  were wearing the same shirt  oh wait no thats just my shirt reflected in yours  one of the 24 similarities between girls and fish  is that theyre both attracted to shiny objects  you really never read my blog do you  all right tin man lets hit it  all right well have fun at your little disco guys  what the hell happened to these two  marshall and i are just growing up  yeah its going to be sweet too  like tonight were tasting all these different wines  pairing them up with these cool gourmet cheeses  wow who knew being in a committed heterosexual relationship could make a guy so gay  all right cool kids are leaving now  grandma grandpa dont wait up  my oh my there are some ferociouslooking cutlets here tonight  all right hookup strategy  colon find a cutlet lock her in early  grind with her all night till shes mine  do these strategies ever work for you  the question is do these strategies ever not work for me  either way the answer is about half the time  my bitches  check this out  um theyre with me  um were her bitches too  well wait here  and with todays interest rate climate youve got to go for the 30year fixed mortgage   oh totally  yeah  so marshall what about you  you guys thinking house baby  oh  no i think were going to wait on the baby thing  i mean i love babies babies rule  pudgy arms and stuff  but uh they make you old  kind of like this anchor weighing you down to one spot forever  im three months pregnant  not awkward guys  not awkward unless we let it be awkward  this place seems great  is kelly here  yeah shes around somewhere  uh lets go find her ill introduce you guys  then i should probably duck into the vip room  its so stupid and arbitrary isnt it who gets to be a vip and who doesnt  can we come  its not that arbitrary  whoa this place is loud  you think  think it was kind of weird that ted didnt invite me out with him  why youd rather be out at some dance club all noisy and sweaty with the  is that what you want  is this what you want  30year fixed mortgage im three months pregnant  that was awkward  lets start drinking  not so fast  in order for the tannins to mellow we should let it breathe for about 30 minutes  freaking tannins  do you know what theyre doing in there right now  theyre watching claires ultrasound video  and i swear to god even the baby looks bored  come on its not that bad  were really starting to click with these guys  claire and austin just invited us to their fondue fest next saturday night  are you honestly trying to get me excited about fondue  its dipping stuff in hot cheese whats not to love  okay that does sound good  but its dipping stuff in hot cheese with boring people  marshall its time for us to grow up  marshall knew she was right  he had to stop acting like a kid  but not tonight  now our apartment was on the third floor  so im not sure if this part is actually true  but uncle marshall swears it happened  taxi  the new album is great  its all smooth and polished not dark and heavy like the early stuff  oh yeah nora jones just gets better and better  please tell me we can drink the wine now  five more minutes we dont want to rush those tannins  freaking tannins  im wetting my pants  i think thats when i realized clubs werent awesome  clubs werent even okay  clubs sucked  i had to get out of there   hey robin  hey  why arent you inside  im calling the owner theres a guy in there who wont let me in to the stupid vip room  what are you doing here  oh i had this move so i came here to bust it  can you get me in  great voice mail  thanks ill see you  bye  oh come on he just got here  hes probably famous  oh yeah isnt there a third affleck brother  keith affleck or brian affleck or something  holy crap we just saw brian affleck  its not like i care so much about getting into the vip room  i have been in tons of vip rooms  im not exactly a vip room virgin  but seriously call me back  oh um i was just in there robin sherbotsky im on the list  names already crossed off sorry  but im robin sherbotsky  im a reporter for channel one  theres a channel one  back of the line  should have snuck in with brian affleck  aah coat wench do not uncheck that mans jacket  sorry just being dramatic youre not a coat wench  no no no coat wench i like it  i should get a sign made up  what are you doing here lily let you go  lily who cares right   you are so dead  oh i am so dead   wow im going home  no uhuh  i put my ass and probably other parts of my body on the line  to come down here and party with my bro  now damn it were going to party  all right one beer  yes  finally i dont have to wait a half an hour for a drink  oh man i cant believe i forgot to tell you this  this is important to the story  earlier that day marshall went to the dentist and got a temporary crown put in  okay so anyway  marshall are you okay  again i wasnt there so im a little foggy on the details  taxi  hey  hey  marshall just ditched out on our own party  can you get me in there i kind of need to kill him  actually i cant even get myself in  i was such a dork  i get recognized one time and i start thinking im julia roberts  im no vip  im not even an ip  im just a lowly little pea sitting out here in the gutter  you know something  id take a pea in the gutter over julia roberts any day  hmm  i broke my tooth  do you have  any aspirin  maybe theres  a machine in  the restroom  now to this day i dont know what happened in there  but when marshall came out a few minutes later  rough night  yeah  these clubs are supposed to be fun right  why do i hate them so much  because all of the stuff youre supposed to like usually sucks  like these clubs or cruises  or new years eve  or the super bowl  or parades  the rockettes  or parades   you said that already  i really hate parades  okay  he just left in the middle of our own party you dont do that  unless of course youre chasing after somebody whos already done it  and then then i think its okay  well i hate to take his side but come on a wine tasting  whats the big plan for next saturday scrabble night  dont check your email  why are you becoming this person  i heard that in college you flashed a campus tour group on a dare  once on a dare  the other times were just for fun  im not in college anymore  id love to go back and be that person again but you cant move backwards  you can only go foreword  um false  you can go wherever you want  i guess the question is where do you want to go  i want to go into this club and find my fianc  well that you cant do  want to bet  follow my lead  hey big guy  i said follow my lead   please please come on  follow her lead do it please   follow her please  yes please  those were the four greatest and only breasts ive ever seen  yeah see if everyone keeps telling you something is supposed to be fun its usually not   right  right  so by that logic if you and i were to say go out on a date  well then we couldnt go anywhere thats supposed to be fun  right the dmv it is  then well get our teeth cleaned  sounds awful its a date  okay  but theres still one big question that needs to be answered  how many of these coats do you think i can put on all at once  okay for the wedge  barney  ted  get your coat were leaving  what what happened to that um cutlet you were grinding with  that was my cousin leslie   what  no no no  were not laughing about this ted  this is not gonna be some funny story that well be telling in a couple months  its not gonna be like hey ha remember that time when you were grinding with no  and you know why  because italics  this night did not happen  you promise me you will never ever ever tell  another living soul what transpired here tonight   you promise  all right   promise  all right i promise   get marshall and go okay  all right  hey thanks for saving my night  ill talk to you soon  um hey tip her barney  why i didnt check a coat  and even if i did on principle tip jars have become so  funny story barney was grinding with this girl all night  fine  i learned a new trick  so marshall and lily rediscovered their youth  it was nice  and then it got icky  im really glad you guys came out tonight  you know dude can i just say something  it kind of hurt that you guys didnt invite me out  i mean i know things have changed since i got engaged  but it would have been nice to be asked  im sorry i just assumed  they played some good songs tonight  i mean lately  i know i know it just seems like suddenly were living in two different worlds  maybe youve got more in common with barney  what  are you crazy  you think i like going to those clubs  id so much rather go to your fruity little wine tasting  oh god im gonna barf  wheres my purse wheres my purse  im okay  the problem is you cant do any of that couple stuff unless you have someone to do it with  and the only way im gonna find that someone is by going out  and doing stupid single stuff with barney  what  but man when i find her were gonna have some badass wine tastings  its a plan  hey maybe itll be that cute coat check girl  yeah  maybe it will be  it wasnt  you know ted i dont say this nearly enough but i really  that place has great salads
