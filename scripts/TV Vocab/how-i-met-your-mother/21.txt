picky  youre never going to find this girl  exactly so im just going to wait for her to come to me  i am done trying to plan the unplannable  so what you think fates just going to take care of it  thats the plan  and little did i know at that very moment fate  in the form of a 600 gigahertz superprocessing computer  was taking care of it  whoa youre up early  yeah thought id whip up some pancakes  does marshall know  hes still sound asleep  awesome  so awesome  god best girl ever  screw these pancakes i should cover you in syrup and gobble you up  please dont do that  hey is this milk

high point of my day  it was true  see marshall had always dreamed of using his law degree to protect the environment  but he needed money for the wedding  so hed been interning for two months at barneys firm  and he hated every minute of it  hey barney i had some questions about filling out these requisition forms  binoculars second pair on my desk  i dont have time to be creepy dude i have a lot of work to do  just take a look will ya  okay corner office top floor  check out that guy  names clark butterfield  he works over at nicholson hewitt and west  and every morning he orders a sandwich from the deli downstairs  so  so guess what i did to that sandwich  here i took a picture  oh sweet lord  and now im emailing said picture to him  ooh duck  that is sick  why would you do that  who knows this feud goes so far back i cant remember who fired the first shot   you  totally  well look if you would just help me fill out these forms that would be great  what  butterfield is going to retaliate within the next four hours thats been his pattern  this is war eriksen i need you to clear your schedule  call lily tell her youll be home late  this is stupid  stu come on man i didnt recruit you to work here for your lawyering skills  i recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant  this is a job for me barney  its a way to make some extra wedding money and thats it  now im sorry but i have work to do  tracy could you come in here please  would you please inform mr eriksen that im no longer speaking to him  mr eriksen mr stinson is no longer  i get it thank you tracy  hello  hello may i speak with a mr ted mosby  speaking  mr mosby how you doing sir bob rorschach over here at love solutions  you signed up for our services about six months ago  uh yeah you guys never found me a match  right well actually thats why im calling  we found her sir  we found your soul mate  i dont understand what happened to ellen pierce doesnt she run this place  well my firm bought out the company  you know were a highend meats and textiles conglomerate  but the geniuses at corporate decided they wanted to diversify so  here i am  so im in good hands  you found me a match  there she is your soul mate thatll be 500 bucks  no way the last time i did this the girl turned out to be engaged  shes not engaged shes your soul mate  just read the file  so i read the file and by god this woman was perfect  she liked dogs she spent her summers in north carolina  she played bass guitar she did the times crossword  she played tennis she liked old movies her favorite food was lasagna  her favorite book was love in the time of cholera her favorite singer was otis redding  and she wanted two kids a boy and a girl  all right fine set it up  you wanted to see me so i guess that means were talking again  will you taste this latte for me i think they gave me decaf  tastes normal to me  thats what i thought too  then i got this email from butterfield  oh god  it got me as well  well then why did you have me drink it  because now youre in  okay  dont think im overlooking the obvious fact that i should just be mad at you  but executive mischief consultant marshall eriksen reporting for duty  lets make that bastard pay  you think that we should brush our teeth first  yeah its probably a good idea  so that night i had a blind date with my perfect match  i was so excited i got there early  but before it even started  lily  hey ted are you busy  um yes  oh right soul mate forgot  listen could you take a cab out to duchess county and change a flat on marshalls fiero  what what no  cant you just call marshall  marshall cant know about this  look ted its dark i dont know how to change a tire  and ive stumbled into the beginning of a very scary campfire story   can you please hurry  i cant im waiting  oh my god is that a drifter with a hook for a hand  no drifter no  come on lily  but you see my point  all right stay there im on my way  and so one 90 cab ride later i was in the middle of nowhere  oh thank god  im so sorry about this did you get ahold of your date  y es  and was she okay about pushing it back  yes because shes perfect so what am i doing here   you can never tell marshall  i wont  ever swear swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl  i swear on luke and leia  about a month ago i started getting insomnia  marrying marshall had been all i wanted for a long time  but now that it was really happening it seemed kind of huge and scary  did you talk to marshall about it  he wouldnt have understood hes not exactly nervous about tying the knot  so i spent my nights reading painting  setting the high score on super bomber man  that was you awesome  i know i just got in the zone and  not the point of the story  and then i started thinking about victoria and how she followed her dream to germany  and i found that art fellowship  let me guess its somewhere far away  san francisco  but its not like im going to do it  the dates conflict with the wedding  but i love painting and ive always wondered if im any good  this was a way to find out  and the interview is tonight  in new haven  you dont want to get married  of course i want to get married  i its not like i was ever going to do it  i just i just really wanted to see if i could get this  lily we live in the center of art and culture in america  im sure you could find a program here thats just as selective  but you chose one in a city 3000 miles away and you didnt tell marshall  i think its pretty clear what that means  okay i was i was having second thoughts  but im not any more  i i mean this flat tire was a sign im not supposed to do this  im supposed to go home andand be with marshall   you must think im so stupid  i dont think youre stupid   i love marshall  i know you do come here  its okay look  marriage is big youre allowed to freak out  but why am i the only one  how come marshall isnt doing anything crazy  so all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice  all done  ted lets go to new haven  lily dont do this to yourself  i just need to know if i can get in  if i do this interview and get into the program then ill know  and i can forget all about it and get married  come on its an adventure  no its not an adventure its a mistake  okay yes its a mistake i know its a mistake  but there are certain things in life where you know its a mistake  but you dont really know its a mistake  because the only way to really know its a mistake is to make the mistake  and look back and say yep that was a mistake  so really the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake  because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not  and damn it ive made no mistakes  ive done all of this my life my relationship my career mistakefree  does any of this make sense to you  i dont know you said mistake a lot  lily dont do this  ted im getting married in two months and im freaking out  and youre my best friend and you just have to forgive me for this  forgive you for what lily  lily  hey lily this is ted the guy you left stranded by the side of the road  i just wanted to say good luck with the
