tenfoot limbo pole  oh like first corinthians  that bible verse  they do that at every wedding  hows it go  love is patient and kind  love does not envy or boast  it is not arrogant or rude  love does not insist on its own way  it is not irritable or resentful  love bears all things  believes all things  hopes all things  endures all things   lame  going on the list  weve done it a wedding with zero clichs  wait isnt doing it in the reception hall bathroom kind of a clich  well okay one clich  well technically two  no they cleared our plates again  peppercrusted rack of lamb where did you go  its my wedding night i was supposed to have my way with you  well you still have me  yeah  anyway guys were kind of in the middle of something  so if you could go bicker or share a tense sexless silence  or whatever married people do somewhere else thatd be great  no barney this is my wedding  and i will sit wherever i damn well  are those mini quiches  tell the secret  okay uh  it was our anniversary  so we went to this restaurant carmichaels  which is where we went on our first date  remember the place where i stole the blue french horn for robin  oh right that was you  i knew that was somebody i knew  what  dude you were there  that was like a big iconic moment in all of our lives  maybe in your life i got a lot of stuff going on  okay so were sitting there and the waiter comes over  champagne  um we didnt order champagne  compliments of the house  wow  thanks  cheers  and there sitting at the bottom of my champagne glass is  mini quiche  youre a megadouche  oh thats right they moved that table back toward the kitchen  because thats where theyre setting up a surprise chocolate fountain  oh no i gave it away  so what was in the glass  right  so the waiter comes up with two glasses of dom  he says champagne we didnt order any champagne  compliments of the house wow  you said that already  right so robin looks down  and there at the bottom of her glass  is an engagement ring  anything you want to say to the bride and groom  dont get married  why dont i come back  an engagement ring  no no no no no no no  ted you cannot do this to me no  no no no  thats what she said  no  no no no no no ted you cannot do this to me  no no no no  what are you talking about  this this is what im talking about what is this doing in my champagne  oh god listen i just got to get out of here  thats not mine  what  thats not mine  then whose is it  its mine  janna  will you marry me  yes  wow  that was hilarious i was like what  anyway  what the hell was that  what the hell was what  that reaction  i thought you were proposing to me  really because it sounded like you thought i was trying to set you on fire  ted you know how i feel about marriage  now more than ever  im sorry were you planning on proposing tonight  no  then why is this an issue  because even though you dont want to get married  id like to think the fact that weve been together for a year  and that we love each other might get me a gentler reaction  than no no no no no no no no no  ted you cannot do this to me  no no no no  okay youre right i just freaked out  i dont know why  im sorry  can we please just let it go  no  hey stinson  never lie to a man about a chocolate fountain  so did you guys find anything to eat  i had four strawberries  was there a side of champagne with each of the strawberries  yes  lily you could have burped or said the word yes  but the fact that you did both is exactly why i married you  oh look more strawberries  so what happened next   ted dont do this  no

what we wanted  she did eventually go on to live in argentina  and morocco and greece russia  even japan for a little while  and i well i met your mom  i think for the most part if youre really honest with yourself  about what you want out of life  life gives it to you  of course at that moment all i really wanted was a scotch and soda  and a cigar  im really sorry about you and robin  i know i was always joking around about wanting you two to break up  but you were really good together  yeah  we were  she just wasnt the one you know  the one oh ted no  do not tell me youre going to start searching for the one again  the only time i want to hear you saying the one  is if its followed by the word hundredth what up  no i need a break from all that i  i just want to get out there and have fun for a while you know  really  cause  you know youve been in a relationship for a year  youre going to be a little rusty   yeah  im just saying  youre gonna need need need some help out there
