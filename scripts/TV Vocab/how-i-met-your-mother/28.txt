cougar  an older woman usually in her 40s or 50s  single and on the prowl for a younger man  whats a woman in her 60s or 70s a turtle  marshall ive thought it over and i accept your challenge   i didnt challenge you to have sex  tomorrow the cougar hunt begins  so i quit my job  i just couldnt take it anymore  approximately 50 times a day some guy asks me for a lei  classic  ted didnt you tell me they need a new assistant in your office  yeah  somebody did just quit  so where should we eat today  oh awesome you brought lunch for everyone  dude that is coldblooded  it  was an honest mistake  look when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it  its okay to assume they made lunch for everyone  ted that girl didnt quit you destroyed her  it was an whole chicken  and did i mention she had 12 sides  oh now youre gonna bash her figure real classy ted  so lily what do you say do you want the job  what would i be doing  basically youre sort of a general office assistant  youll sit there my station is right over here  and things are a little bit crazy right now  cause were pitching a new building to a big client   oh right is that the  yeah  heres the model  you werent kidding it really does look like a giant penis  i know  for whatever reason mr druthers just doesnt see it  how can he not see it   i mean theres the  i know   and the way it  i know   and the two little  i know   wow it is just  spectacular  why thank you  lily this is mr druthers the head architect on the project  lilys going to be our new office assistant   ah  nice to meet you  isnt it  ted i looked at your design for the penthouse balcony  tell me do you want to be an architect  i uh i am an architect  really  well my sixyearold nephew plays with legos  is he an architect  well not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams  ted youve got promise  but you have to study what i do more carefully  now i want you to design some styrofoam trees  for the building model   think you can handle that  absolutely  good so youre going to design the   styrofoam trees  once again with feeling   styrofoam trees  styrofoam trees   styrofoam trees  thats the spirit  now gather round  this isnt just about trees ted this is about life  and sometimes in life you have to get the trees just right  or youre fired hmm  man that guy is a total well  okay wait wait wait thats professor lewiss office there  okay lets take a look  oh yeah its a cougar all right  a prime specimen  see you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics  start  with the hair  the cougar keeps up with current hairstyles  as a form of camouflage  the prey may not realize that hes engaged a cougar  until hes already being dragged helpless  back to her lair  now  the blouse  the cougar displays maximum cleavage possible  to captivate her prey  if youre watching them bounce  shes about to pounce  see the claws  long and sharp  to ward off rival females  or open alimony checks  yeah this ones a beaut  okay let the hunt begin  wait wait wait im not so sure im comfortable  with you hunting my constitutional law professor  who do you rather have grading your papers  a savage maneating jungle cat  or a purring satisfied kitty  go barney  go mount and stuff that cougar  scusi i am luigi italian exchange student  i was uh walking to class  but then i noticed you  bella principessa  tell me what you want or get out  direct  i like that  the names barney  what i want is you  turn around  my place two hours  dont be tardy  i cant believe how mr druthers treats people  and that building talk about overcompensating  hes not usually this bad  its just that the partners have made it very clear  this project is make or break for us  so lately hes been a little testy  you know what i mean crotchety  im just saying its been hard on him  all right stop   did you show lily your design  no   what design  its nothing  its fantastic  just for fun teds been working on his own design  and it doesnt look at all like male genitalia  at least not healthy male genitalia  ted you should pitch your building to druthers  are you kidding hes hammond druthers  hes a legend im just part of his team  this building is huge for the firm  so its really important we dont blow it  all right enough  oh my god incredible  hmm cminus  cminus what are you talking about  i just pulled an allnighter  you didnt budget your time well  you glossed over some of the most important points  and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive  mr druthers asked if you were making the trees  or waiting for them to sprout on their own  then he stared at me until i laughed  okay im done  great ill put the paints away you just go show him  great thanks  well finally  i wondered whether you were making the trees  or waiting for them to sprout on their own  good one sir  anyway here they are   too green  too green  yes the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color  almost brunette  and think bushier i want this tower to rise  from a thicket of wild ungroomed brunette shrubbery  can you picture it ted  i cant unpicture it  good  oh my god  its gone  what whats gone  my  baseball signed three times by pete rose  well its got to be around here somewhere  what do you think ted  it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away  somebody stole it  well um i better get back to these styrofoam trees  oh who cares about the trees  its just busy work to make you feel like youre contributing  inspiring as always sir  lily  wheres she put those paints  hey  hey um lily question for you  why did i find  mr druthers baseball  signed three times by pete rose in your desk drawer  thats easy i took it  why  its simple  i cant believe theres no horseradish for the roast beef  i guess you were sick the day they taught that at sandwich university  mother no one from the nursing home is stealing from you  i didnt get you a birthday present  what you gonna cry  little crybabys going to cry  hey everybody look  the little crybabys gonna cry  i lost my ice cream  okay i may have exaggerated that last one  but the point is he was mean  and thats why i took away his ball  what does his ball have to do with anything  druthers has to be taught he cant behave like that  when i was teaching kindergarten whenever a kid was mean  i would take away one of his toys  the kid would be upset at first  but then hed learn to stop being mean  hey guys whats going on  lily stole my boss baseball signed three times by pete rose  why was he being mean   you know about this  yeah  its her own personal form of justice  did you tell him about that time at the gap  oh that was a good one  this sales guy was rude to robin  so  i took a pair of khakis  i gave them to you for your birthday  so ive been walking around in stolen khakis  i prefer to call them justice khakis  thats not justice its shoplifting and its a crime  so is being mean  lily your little system doesnt even make sense  in kindergarten the kid knew why he was being punished  druthers just thinks someone stole his ball  well thats why i left a note   a note  yeah  when he finds it hell understand why his ball was taken away  hell stop being mean  and the office will be a nicer place to work  maybe hell even be open to hearing your ideas  look lil were all tolerating  this prolonged nervous breakdown youre clearly having  with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny  but this is my career youre messing with  im not sure i like your tone  you know what  now you just lost the ball  hey  id ask you how last night went but we had a pop quiz today  nobody got higher than a cminus  i know i know  you claim to have so much sex  i only assumed youd be good at it  look i miscalculated  i thought shed be old and fragile like most cougars  but kittys got claws  dont worry though  tonight im seeing her again  just let it go man youre making things worse  i promise you after tonight that cougar will be my pet  and i its master  i think im falling in love with you  oh god that wasnt your first time was it  although that would explain a lot  what no we had sex yesterday  oh right that  well you had sex yesterday  i revised my syllabus for the spring semester  when druthers goes to get his bagel  ill go in grab the note put the ball back  if something goes wrong  yell out who wants espresso  so ill know hes coming got it  okay now give me the ball   no  what do you mean no  i mean i stand by what i did ted  come on lily were running out of time  everybody get in here now  who wants espresso  now as most of you know  my pete rose pete rose pete rose baseball has been stolen  well i just found this note  dear mr druthers i your baseball am leaving  maybe if you start being nice ill come back  if not other things in your office may follow my lead  in fact i overheard your ipod talking  and he may shuffle off at any minute  normally i would scream at everyone until my voice goes  but maybe thats the wrong reaction here  interesting  instead im giving my baseball until the end of the day  to decide hes homesick  or tomorrow morning ill begin firing three people an hour  and if the thief doesnt believe me well  then you are gambling more than pete rose  major league baseballs alltime hit leader  a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty  to the entire sports world ever allegedly did  wow looks like byebye ipod  give him his ball back right now  people are going to get fired  no theyre not its just a tantrum ted  i saw this in kindergarten all the time  this isnt kindergarten  mr druthers is an adult and he wants his ball back  all right ill give it back if you show him your plans  no youll give it back or youre fired  im sorry ted i just cant do that  then youre fired  fine  heres the ball  at least you have one now  dude youre killing me  you didnt tame the cougar you just made her angrier  do you not see the powerbar in my hand  im fueling up  so youre going back over there  oh yeah  and tonight just like john mellencamp  i am going to get rid of the cougar once and for all  get it  cause thats what he did with his name  i cant stop thinking about you  please give me another chance  barney i teach all day  its the last thing i want to do when i get home  but you dont understand see ive been going easy on you  holding

hurry up clients will be here any moment  now slide it closer to his chair  i want this thing to really smack him in the face  mr druthers thank you again for understanding about lily  oh well i pity her  i mean to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note  you might say that lily was mentally deranged  you might say that ted  lily was mentally deranged  you might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear  lily was mentally deranged  oh thats a bit harsh dont you think ted  the clients are here  excellent  bring them in  our client was a major bank and financial services company in spokane  they wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured  the distinct flavor and history of the northwest  ladies and gentlemen i give you  the spokane national bank building  thats a penis  thats thats ridiculous  theres no way this majestic tower can be confused  with the male organ of love  were not building a penis  you got any other ideas  other ideas  you said you wanted hammond druthers  this is hammond druthers  well hats off to your ladyfriends  but im not building it  were done here  the trajectory of my entire career might have been different  had i not

hey im project manager now  so if you want your old job back  no thanks  i think i figured out what i want to be when i grow up  casey thats not how we treat people  youll get this back when you learn
