                so kids there are many buildings in new york city  thousands of apartments  millions of stories  and even though its been decades and someone else lives there now  theres one apartment in particular that will always be our apartment  i have so many great memories of that place  marshall playing video games  lily painting on the fire escape  hey  sorry mr matson  and me making the coffee  i had this coffee pot it was probably 50 years old at the time  and it made truly terrible coffee  we called it shocky  plugging in  saving game  i loved every last detail of that place  right down to the incredibly tacky swords we hung on the wall  i never wanted any of it to change  but thats not how life works  you guys will never believe what just happened to us  i dont even believe it myself  we were in queens and we decided to stop by my apartment  wait her apartment  i thought aunt lily lived with you and uncle marshall  i could see how you would think that but i have to have my own place  its an independence thing  when was the last time you were there  three months ago  what  its like fat pants  you hope you never have to use them but youre glad to know theyre there  what the hell  what  this is my apartment  where  right here  what the hell  lily this is a chinese restaurant  no no this was my apartment  my dresser was right  thats my dresser  and this is my closet  and i spilled nail polish there theres the stain  hi how many  lily  yes you know me  yeah from your homecoming picture  youre much prettier in person  yeah i know the bangs were a mistake  wheres my stuff  oh its all in the back  we could wrap it up for you  you want it to go  this is my apartment  not anymore  no way youre making this up  yeah the building would have had to give you some kind of notice  they sent you a notice about this  when  three months ago  and heres your mail  minus magazines  well still legally they cant just toss you out on the street  you have a lease  okay so i didnt have a written lease as such  but go ask my landlady mrs conroy  she may be 98 years old but shes still  shes dead isnt she  never even saw the bus  my apartment is a chinese restaurant  what am i going to do  come live with us  really  of course  you sure about this ted  yeah i mean you basically live here anyway  its not like itll change anything  no its like it will change everything  oh ted

its its bumming me out  all right ted call me from the hospital  all right  youre going to the hospital  no see hes going to go back over there and im going to call him  hes going to pretend its an emergency call from a family member at the hospital  oh lord fake emergency  that is the lamest most pathetic copout in the book  i expect more from you barney  well stay tuned im working on some stuff  but in the meantime wish me luck  so are you going to talk to marshall  hes going to want the apartment im going to want the apartment  its going to lead to an argument so no  hmm thats real healthy  so when a serious issue comes up your response is just to avoid it  i should really make this call  ooh can i do it  excuse me  hello  hi there sexy  hello aunt cathy whats up  oh nothing

place for it  too bad the swords are there  we kind of love those swords  well those swords have been up there a long time  i know right id really miss them too  so maybe marshalls room  okay  he was going to take the swords down  can you believe that  ted why dont you just talk to him hes your best friend  one of your best friends  the point is maybe its time for some healthy communication  healthy communication  thats the worst idea ever  look you held off their first advance thats good  now its time to counterstrike  well what am i supposed to do  you got to mark your territory  and i dont mean missing the toilet  youve got to do something big  what like buy a new sofa  bigger  katies here  okay real quick last night epiphany  i realized what the world of dating needs ready  a lemon law  a lemon law like for cars  exactly  from the moment the date begins you have five minutes  to decide whether youre going to commit to an entire evening  and if you dont its no hard feelings just  good night thanks for playing see you never  huh huh the lemon law its going to be a thing  possibly starting right now  hi katie barney  hi its good to finally meet you  hmm yeah katie you are about to be a part of history  tell your friends  its going to be a thing  man teds been acting weird  he started labeling all his food  he even carved ted into that block of cheese  yeah  well now its eds  i think hes not cool with me moving in  no thats not it  youve basically lived here all along  ted loves you  so whats he pmsing about  i dont know  but when hes ready to talk to me about it hell come and talk to me about it  are you kidding  you guys never talk about anything  hell just let it fester under the surface  until he doesnt something big and passiveaggressive  you clearly dont know ted  delivery for ted mosby  your english phone booth arrived  oh awesome its great right  yeah i guess  im just not sure if lilys going to like it  well i like it so im just going to keep it right here if thats cool  of course  i mean we all live here so  we should all be able to have things the way we want them  exactly  great  terrific  you like the phone booth it stays  i like this painting  so im just going to hang it  right here on the wall  oh so its like that is it  oh hello governor oh its like that isnt it cheerio  yeah its like that   i want this apartment  well i want it too  youre a jerk  no im a visionary  lemon law its going to be a thing  for the record your little lemon law is a symbol of everything  thats wrong with our noattentionspan society  no wrong lemon laws awesome  it takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone  you keep giving up on people so quickly you could miss out on something great  okay youre on a blind date  sitting across from the table is that guy  you really think itll take more than five minutes  to realize there will be no date number two  yes i do  for all i know that guys my soul mate  oh bad move scherbotsky  hi  have you met robin   hi  hi  all right marshall were deciding right now who gets this apartment  may lead to an argument  but were settling this  or we could flip a coin  yeah lets flip a coin   flip it  okay  im flipping it here i go   flip it  okay here i go   flip it  im flipping  but before i do i just want to say something  you didnt even want to move in here in the first place  you said a prewar building was bad for your allergies  that was five years ago  now you can get prescriptionlevel antihistamines over the counter  oh snap what else you got  okay im flipping heads or tails   you dont need two rooms  heads or tails marshall   like you need two rooms  we might be starting a family soon  oh no youre not theres no way youre having a baby while youre still in law school  its going to be at least three years  it could be sooner were not that careful with our birth control  twozip  oh come on you know damn well i move out that rooms going unused  oh and i suppose youll get a new roommate whos it going to be barney  you know he cooks naked  yeah well at least barney wouldnt take the swords down  we were bros  these swords represent our brohood  and you took them down to make room for your fiancees stupid painting  my fiancee suddenly shes my fiancee  lilys a part of who i am  and if youre such a bro shes a part of who you are too  shes a bro by extension  i deserve this apartment marshall  no more than i do  great  so lets flip for it  flip it  si this is how were deciding who gets the apartment  i guess so  how are we doing this exactly  is this like to the death  we should probably figure that out  ooh ow ow  hes okay hes okay hes okay  can i observe something  that this is kind of awesome  totally   i cant believe we didnt do this before  i know  thank you  i cant believe this  im sitting here with a beautiful woman i just met eating at my favorite restaurant  sweet  its a nice place  its good to know the future has ribs  in the future food will most likely be served in gel cap form  plus cows will probably have died out by then  or be our leaders  hello  hhhhhey times running out scherbotsky  last chance for the lemon law  leave me alone   were
