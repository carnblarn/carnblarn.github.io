single one of  my girlfriends about when were gonna get married and have kids  but this is the first time shes meeting me  doesnt matter  and youll know its coming  when she mentions my cousin stacy six kids in five years  the womans basically a ride at a water park  but i dont want to get married and have kids  what am i supposed to say  you know what  youre an adult with perfectly valid opinions  you shouldnt have to apologize for them  im gonna lie i would  thanks again for letting me have the u2 box set  i know how important it is to you  i talked to aunt caroline the other day  stacys pregnant again  oh good for her  so dear  oh boy tell us what its like being a journalist  im just not ready  okay no pressure  oh  uh i thought you um  its great  good  focus on your job now  because your career clock is ticking  theres time for marriage and kids  and all that other stuff later  ooh a piano  ted you lucked out with my mom last night huh  what a relief right  oh absolutely whew what a relief it is  to know im the one girlfriend  your mom doesnt want you to have kids with  hooray  i mean did she really think that your college girlfriend chery  would pop out attractive children  cause ive seen pictures and im sorry  that girl had a brow ridge like a caveman  come on she was just frowning under direct light  and besides thats not even what i liked about her  it was her its not important  what happened to marshall and lily  theyve been fighting lately  theyre probably off somewhere going at it  more coffee  oh no thank you  isnt she sweet  well if shes so sweet maybe she should have teds babies  excuse me  nothing  lily just a minute  marshall maybe less  robin dear  did i say something to upset you  why dont you want me to have your grandkids  do you want to have my grandkids  no  i mean i dont know  i just  i want you to want me to want to have your grandkids  and you should  im a genetic gold mine  no family history of diabetes  or heart disease  everyone has nonporous teeth and perfect eyesight  i had one schizophrenic uncle  but even he had perfect vision  which was unfortunate for the people around the bell tower he was in  but still he w a very fine man and  excuse me sorry  didnt know that there was a line  marshall your zipper  oh  robin its not that i dont want grandkids  its just i dont think anyone should make the mistake  of getting married too young  why do you say that  i mean you got married pretty young  that wasnt a mistake  was it  whispers well  okay theres something you dont know  waitress smile  i wish your face would melt off  i wish your eyeballs would explode  im gonna kill him  i dont care how unpleasant it is  you have to talk to him  not now okay if you dont i will  robin  oh gosh let me help you pick those up sweetheart  sweetheart  sweetheart  the only sweetheart in your life  should be the woman you married 30 years ago  not the waitress at the bar last night  and not this clumsy floozy  im sorry youre not a floozy  im upset i dont know what im saying  but stay away from my dad  ted what are you talking about  dad  you uh want to tell mom  what happened at the bar last night  okay  i hooked up with a waitress  oh  oh  i mean oh  oh ooh  were going to have a serious talk  about this when we get home al  oh ooh  serious talk  mom what  he was kissing another woman  dont you care  mrs mosby  ted we werent quite sure how to tell you this  your mother and i are divorced  you  what do you mean youre divorced  since when  oh gosh its been about nine months now  closer to ten i think  time flies chuckles  so ten months ago you just up and decided  to get divorced without telling me  no it wasnt a snap decision  wed been separated almost two years  how could you not tell me this  we meant to it just never seemed like the right time  so last christmas  we talked about telling you kids then  but it didnt seem very christmasy  i got you a tandem bike  oh it didnt go to waste  your mother and frank ride it all the time  who the hell is frank  chuckling oh great guy  i actually set them up  you remember dr muchnik  he did your braces  okay my heads about to explode  and i dont want to get it all over everyones waffles  so i am leaving  teddy bear oh  you know he mentioned he was divorced last night  i totally spaced on that  ooh no line at the omelet station  lily  im sorry that i said all those things  me too  i just find it really confusing to be around you right now  its the same for me  i think were probably both better off  trying to keep some distance for a while  yeah i think youre right  are you wearing a pushup bra  did you mystic tan your calves  i withdraw the question  were sorry we didnt say anything about the divorce  it was wrong not to tell you  thank you  but listen dont tell your sister  it would just upset her  no this is ridiculous  we have to start talking about stuff and not just baseball  indians won today on a walkoff double  against the red sox boy thats a big win  no no no  were not gonna blow past this  i mean i dont even  know who you people  i dont even know how you met  i never told you how i met your mother  no  oh great story  at a bar  thats it  thats what passes for communication in our family  man when i have kids  and i tell them how i met their mother  im gonna tell them everything the whole damn story  i think it was an irish bar  i just i dont i dont understand  you seemed so happy  when i was growing up  you seemed so  what happened  we just realized were very different people  your fathers kind of a headintheclouds romantic  and im much more down to earth  so  robin and i are like that  that doesnt mean anything  i wanted kids  and your mother  also wanted kids  robin and i have different views on families  were not about to break up because of it  on some level i always knew  i didnt even want to go out with him in the beginning  but he spent months badgering me until i finally gave in  huh  well when you dont connect on that many fundamental levels  its only a matter of time before you realize  youre not meant to be together  but we love robin  mr mosby absolutely  meeting you was the highlight of my trip  well second highlight  mrs mosby well see you inside  sorry  wow  i know  they love me  we are definitely going to try and communicate more  from now on full disclosure  good good i think itll be really good for the family  by the wayhows grandma she hasnt returned my last couple calls  im gonna get some juice  no  no  you missed a great game last night real squeaker
