                when your uncle marshall was ten years old  he read a book called life among the gorillas  it was written by an anthropologist named dr aurelia birnholzvazquez  and it told the story of the year she spent living among the western lowland gorillas of cameroon  when dr birnholzvazquez came to the local community college to give a lecture  marshall the youngest member of the audience raised his hand with a question  what advice do you have for a budding anthropologist  so you want to be an anthropologist  yep when i grow up i want to go live with the gorillas just like you did  what she said next changed his life  oh thats wonderful but im afraid you cant  theyll all be dead by then  and if economic sanctions and trade restrictions arent enforced  the destruction of the rainforests will continue and over a million species will be wiped out  so you dont want coffee  im saying that the coffee industry is causing irreversible   all right im pouring it out  okay one cup

kids to a great school  a vacation once in a while  lily doesnt care about that stuff  well no now she doesnt but hows she going to feel in a couple years  when shes supporting you on a kindergarten teachers salary  while youre off in court defending some endangered south american flying beaver  shell be happy  okay  but will you be happy knowing you could have made her a lot happier  and all four are totally naked you gotta choose one what do you do go  i guess uh  bea arthur  ahh wrong betty white  clean this stuff up eriksen  so did she get the awesome care package yet  yep yesterday  did she love it  ooh she loved it  so whats the problem  so i was talking to her last night and i should tell you  weve been talking on the phone every other night for like an hour and a half  eventually you just run out of stuff to say  what did you have for lunch today  oh rye bread  yeah  oh teddy boy  im usually so good at being a boyfriend but this neverseeingeachother thing its a bitch  maybe it just cant be done  i think its clear what i have to do  its pretty clear  i have to go to germany and surprise her  totally what i was thinking  get out of my head man  barney how do i get these idiots to leave me alone  marshall consider the penguins  the penguins  on the wall  conformity its the one whos different that gets left out in the cold  this is a motivational poster  look at yourself marshall youre not happy  and you know why because youre different  now i suppose you could learn to love yourself for the unique little snowflake that you are  or you could change your entire personality which is just so much easier  change your personality that is so awful and not at all motivational  not necessarily okay at first i was appalled  but then i realized its just like dr aurelia birnholzvasquez in life among the gorillas  i have to gain the acceptance of the herd by behaving exactly like one of them  its an anthropological study isnt that cool  it sounds kinda like peer pressure  no no no its totally anthropological  and its cool and im doing it  yeah im pretty sure its peer pressure we have an assembly every year  im portraying someone who succumbs to peer pressure  all right but if those guys try to pressure you to smoke what do you say   only when im drunk  good boy  and so to fit in with the gorillas marshall had to learn to act like a gorilla  and that meant gorilla lessons  okay im psyched about this  but if im going to mentor you i need to know youre psyched about this too  oh i am im im psyched  yeah but its one thing to say it its another thing to show it  show it  im psyched  what was that  marshall i should feel tremors of psychitude rock my body like a seizure  that was like a declawed pregnant cat on a porch swing idly swatting  at a fly on a lazy sunday afternoon  wow that was really specific  show me youre psyched  lets do this   ow that hurt  so badly  and then you slip it to the guy with a discreet handshake and hell get it done  right get what done  whatever  cool  and what guy is this  theres always a guy  okay all right i uh i think im ready  you sure you want to practice your story one more time  all right  so dude

more i cant  like i remember how she makes me feel  i just i dont completely remember her  its like im trying to preserve something thats already gone  preserving something thats already gone  sounds like environmental law  i dont know  we struggle so hard to hold onto these things  that we know are going to disappear eventually  and thats really noble  but even if you save every rainforest from being turned into a parking lot  well then where are you going to park your car  done dirt cheap  dirty deeds  done dirt cheap  dirty deeds  done dirt cheap  dirty deeds and theyre done dirt cheap ow
