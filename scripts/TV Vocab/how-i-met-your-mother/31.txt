                learn about relationships is that youre never done  getting to know someone  everyone has secrets  some are nice  you know how to make crepes  that is so cool  some arent as nice  and then there was derek and counting you   that puts the total up to  oh i got your total  ive been counting along  and some are just weird  youre scared of the seven dwarfs  just doc hes creepy  i mean

rather not say   sharper images  but thats where clothes live  guys guys guys robin doesnt like malls  if she doesnt want to tell us why she doesnt have to  i think we should all just respect her privacy  thanks ted  so whats the deal with you and malls  i thought you said that if i didnt want to talk about it  i didnt have to  yeah with those people  but im your boyfriend come on what is it  did you get arrested at a mall  no   dumped at a mall  ted  found out you were canadian at a mall  let it go  trapped under a fake boulder at a mall   let it go  mauled at the mall  let it go  and who gets trapped under a fake boulder at the mall  not me in ohio when i was nine thats for sure  i dont get it why wont robin tell me why she hates malls  ted you should be happy robin has a secret  the more you learn about a person  the better chance you have of hitting the fatal oh moment  the oh moment  yeah that moment when you find out that one detail about a person  that is going to be a deal breaker  its a promise ring  i made a pact with god to stay a virgin till im married  i dont have an eating disorder  its just when i put food in my mouth i chew it and then i spit it out  i just turned 30  so trust me you want to postpone  knowing anything about each other for as long as possible  mmm i disagree if there is some potential oh moment  i want to know about it right away i mean whats the alternative  i now pronounce you man and wife  i love you  i used to be a dude  yeah  i agree with ted  in a real relationship you share everything  thats why marshall and i dont keep any secrets  you are such a cutie pie heres a quarter  go play a song on the jukebox  no its true they tell each other everything  i can think of tons of things theres no way marshalls told you  try me  do you know about the time marshall was in trenton  donkey ate his pants yup  bills bachelor party in memphis  oh when they had to pump out all the nickels from his stomach  wow okay seattle  trick question marshalls never been to the pacific northwest  because hes afraid of sasquatch  damn youre good  im not afraid of sasquatch i just think we should all be on alert  trust me not only do they tell each other everything  they want to know everything  so after the shower i was brushing my teeth and i was like  oh man i wanted to have some orange juice  i should have done that first  but i already had the toothpaste on the toothbrush  so i just went ahead and brushed them anyway  what happened next  yeah meanwhile robin tells me nothing  fine do you want to know what robins secret is  you know  of course i know  she couldnt look at us her face got flushed  thats shame my friend  our friend robin used to do porn wait for it  ography  yeah we didnt really need to wait for that  and its ridiculous  i dont know he could be right  she does have the fake orgasm noises down  hey  what the walls are thin  thats not what im heying you about  you know what it might be  this is going to sound a little crazy but what if robin is married  married what does that have to do with the mall  well maybe she got married at the mall  back home in minnesota a ton of people get married  at the mall of america its great  theres this gorgeous indoor golf course for pictures  numerous fine dining options and talk about a reasonable   we are not getting married at the mall  well just meet with the guy  shes not married robin hates marriage  because she already  got married  at the mall  no because before robin moved to new york she  what was she doing  well i dont know whenever i ask her about canada  she kind of clams up  shes a pretty private person  except when shes talking about  oh a friend of mine in canada got married way too young  and it really turned her off to marriage  what  do you think of this wedding cake  oh i like it  hey you remember that friend of mine in canada  who got married way too young  her wedding cake was a mrs fields giant cookie  no  my friend in canada who got married way too young  they had to do their vows twice once in french  they speak french there too  god that place is a mess  so you dont think theres any friend from canada  oh im sure there is  just like i have a friend who wet his bed till he was ten  use your brain ted  guys theres no way robin is married  its ludicrous to even suggest it   thank you barney  cause its porn  i need another beer  robin was not in porn i bet you anything that shes married  20000 says its porn  i dont have 20000  well then what do you have   well  no  ive got it the ultimate wager  slap bet  oh slap bet we used to do those when i was a kid  what the hells a slap bet  whoever is right gets to slap the other person in the face  as hard as they possibly can but no rings  are you really going to do that thats so immature   you can be slap bet commissioner  ooh i love it what are my powers  um if a problem arises and we need a ruling thats your job  but you have to be unbiased  and put the integrity of slap bet above all else  this is an honor you will take with you to your grave  on your tombstone it will read  lily aldrin caring wife loving friend  slap bet commissioner  and your tombstone will read got slapped by marshall so hard he died  okay what if i just ask robin point blank if she has a husband  you said you would respect her privacy  so maybe you should just drop it  yeah youre right  husband  theres no p in husband  wow you seem to know a lot about husbands  fine ill take it back  oh hey since you mentioned husbands this is great youre going to love this  marshall you know marshall he thinks that the reason  you didnt want to go to the mall the other day  is because you got married at a mall and have a husband in canada  i told him hes crazy because hes crazy right  i mean how crazy is that  are you asking me if im married  well you can ask me  nope im not married your turn  what happened to respecting my privacy  look just say no im not married  ted  i dont understand why you cant  just say no im not married  i cant  marshalls right  i was young and i got married  it was a mistake and  he moved away but  yeah im married  you have a husband  i was young and stupid  and we got married at a mall and we broke up at a mall  and i i havent been to a mall since  why didnt you get divorced  he moved to hong kong for work and i was like  eh good enough  good  enough thats not good enough  you order pancakes you get waffles thats good enough  look i havent seen him in years  its just a part of my life i want to forget  just please dont tell anyone about this  okay  dude your hand is monstrous  yeah well whatd you expect youve seen my penis  i cant believe you told us robins secret  what how could i keep something like that to myself  and you begged me to tell you  no i didnt  please tell us just tell us im begging you  tell us tell us tell us please please please  fine robins married  yeah well you still shouldnt have told us  i mean what kind of boyfriend are you  see thats just it im not the boyfriend  im the mistress  no not the mistress  the mastress  the master what do you call it  uh pretty sure were going to call it mistress  what am i going to do my girlfriends married  do i ask her to get a divorce  ted even if she is married its a canadian marriage  its like their money or their army  nobody takes it seriously  its serious to me  you know what in some countries if you been separated  for longer than five years technically youre no longer married  i can check it out at the law library at school  i can see my hand print on your face  dont get too cocky slappy  i just got a shipment of porn from canada i have to go through  i won the bet why are you still searching  just because you were right doesnt mean im wrong  oh right like you need  an excuse to watch porn  canadian porn  trust me when i tell you their universal health care system  doesnt cover breast implants  if i have to sit through one more flatchested nova scotian  riding a mountie on the back of a zamboni  ill go out of my mind   hey  hey  listen dude i got to talk to you  but you got to promise me that you wont tell barney  fine i wont tell barney what is it   robins not married  what  why would she tell me she was  i dont know but i cross checked every record in canada  theres no record of her ever being married  there must be some mistake  i promise you shes not married  shes not great at parking legally either  so she lied to me wwhat am i going to do  ii cant confront her cause then shell know i told you  you got to lawyer her  you got to ask her a bunch of questions try to trip her up  maybe make her feel guilty whatever it takes  to get a confession out of her  thanks for telling me your secret  it means so much to me that you could be so  god whats the word im looking for  honest  mm thanks ted  yeah you know whats probably the best part about your honesty  how truthful it is  i say we just move on  well for me to get total closure on this whole  my girlfriend has a husband thing  i think i might need a little bit more information  like what month did you get married  june we had a june wedding  ah canada in june  thats the dream  sitdown  or buffet  well its weird that you dont remember  no i just didnt know how to answer  because we did butlered hors doeuvres in the atrium  but the actual dinner was a buffet in the food court  featuring a filet mignon or a roasted potatocrusted salmon  with a lobster scallion beurre blanc  band or dj  a string quartet played at the ceremony  but for the actual reception we had a sevenpiece band  we paid extra for the sax  cause i just love that smooth alto sound   how many bridesmaids  seven   flowers  azaleas   color scheme  dusty rose and sienna  husbands name   you were never married  yes i was   no you werent  how do you know  i looked it up at the library   what library  the one on fifth   when did you go  today at lunch  and i had an apple brie panini with potato salad  im not questioning the lunch part ted  what database did you use  i used the canadian mall marriage 6000  fine marshall looked it up at school   you told marshall   you lied to me  see this is why i dont tell people secrets  you were supposed to be the one person i trusted the most  and even you couldnt keep a secret  but it was a fake secret  yeah i was testing you and you failed  and now youre never gonna know why i dont go to the mall  and its good too  you  were testing me thats insane  oh yeah how long did it take for you to tell marshall  my biggest secret in the world five minutes   that wasnt a real secret  yeah but it could have been  you are driving me crazy  no wonder your fake husband moved to hong kong  he moved there for business  you  you got something to say to me  what are you talking about  i know robin was never really married  how could you possibly know that  and then i put on my pajamas and got into bed  how about you  oh lets see uh first i took the subway to school  then i got a bagel  then i went to the library and found out robin was never married  crazy  then i was hungry again so i went down to the vending machine  but by the time i got down there i wasnt even hungry anymore   you told him  i had to  im slap bet commissioner  believe me this hurts me more than its gonna hurt you  dont count on it ive been practicing on a tree trunk   barney gets three slaps  three  one because you lied and two for being prematurely slapped  three slaps  but  oh my god   are you gonna cry  no  youre gonna cry  i just dont think its healthy to keep big secrets in a relationship  my parents didnt really talk to each other for 30 years  and now theyre divorced  i have shared more of myself with you  than ive ever shared with anyone  im asking for this one secret  which has nothing to do with us to just be mine  so i just got a very interesting phone call  what are you talking about  i know robins secret   what  thats right  i know your secret robin  or should i say robin sparkles  how do you know that name  because i know the truth  and i am about to show it to you right now  gather round ted youre gonna want to see this  yeah no i dont  what  robin wants to keep this a secret so  its gonna stay a secret  yeah its not gonna stay a secret  you see in my research  i came upon a certain gentleman in malaysia  who is in possession of a certain videotape  he just emailed me that it will be up and running  on my space in about right now  robins world is about to be turned upsidedown  i mean im guessing  barney dont okay  robin please dont panic  im only gonna show enough to prove to marshall i was right  no barney i said were not watching this  no its time  look i appreciate what youre trying to do  but if its out there theres no point in trying to hide it anymore  lets just watch it and be done with it  are you as terrified as i am  i dont want to get slapped again  i want to stress that i was young  yeah you were  and i didnt know any better  they never do  and it started out as an innocent modeling job  it always does  please mr johnson  im sorry i was a bad girl  please dont give me detention  isnt there something i can do to make it up to you  oh my god  well obviously ive been proven right  so in the interest of robins dignity  i wont show anymore  plus its getting late its already slap oclock  what the hell was that  uh i slap bet marshall that you did porn so i win  porn i wish it was porn it would be less embarrassing  i know  how about i sing you a song

the first of many many viewings  i cant help but notice that this isnt porn  and yet a slap occurred without the permission  of the slap bet commissioner  looks like somebody suffered from premature slapulation  oh my god robins rapping  guys robins rapping   went to the mall with   a couple of friends    i had a whole weeks   allowance to spend   okay im going to give you a choice  either ten slaps right now in a row  or five slaps that can be doled out  at any point from here to eternity  you go with the ten now  no way why get ten when you can get five  yeah but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment  you could get slapped in the face would drive you crazy  im going to go with the five for eternity   good call  horrible call  relax dude im just going for my soda man
