                when youre single and your friends start to get married  every wedding invitation presents a strange moment of selfevaluation  will you be bringing a guest or will you be attending alone  what its really asking is  where do you see yourself in three months  sitting next to your girlfriend or hitting on a bridesmaid  i always checked that i was bringing a guest  i was an optimist  who the hell am i gonna bring to this wedding  ted have you ignored all my teachings  for the most part yeah  no you dont bring a date to a wedding  thats like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip  oh ted oh ted no no date  deer carcass really thats the metaphor youre going with here  ted its a simile  well its too late now if i dont bring a date  a 200 piece of chickensalmon will go uneaten  i got to bring someone but who  of course i knew who i wanted to bring  robin the big unanswered question in my life  problem was she was dating this really rich guy named derek  derek  well derek and i just broke up  oh no thats terrible are you okay  yeah do you need a drink or something  nah we never really clicked  i felt bad though he was pretty bummed  ah dont beat yourself up  hell be fine i mean the guys like a billionaire  he can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in ten chicks hotter than you  thanks i feel a lot better  i think ill get that drink now  okay guys i got to say something  i think my feelings for robin may be resurfacing  oh please they were buried in a shallow grave  not again come on dude  we all know how this movie ends  ted falls in love love kicks ted in the sprouts roll credits  no you guys just have to look at the whole picture  fact  robin was into me when we first met  fact  even though she didnt want a relationship we had an amazing kiss on the roof  fact  on new years eve we kissed again  fact  i need a date to this wedding  wish me luck  what i dont get is why is claudia marrying stuart  shes way hotter than him  how way  way way  this wedding does sound pretty amazing though  fancy hotel ballroom  everybody all dressed up  oh here we go  what  we cant get anywhere with our wedding plans  because i want it to be fun and marshall wants it to be lame  oh yeah okay thats a pretty fair assessment of our two arguments  i thought so  you know what excuse me if i dont want to get married  barefoot in the woods next to lake noonesgoingtodrivethatfar  yes i want a ballroom  and i want a band and i want shoes  ive been dreaming about this day since i was like  a little girl  what up  okay im just saying that its my wedding too and i should have a say in it  yes but im the bride so i win  well i thought marriage was about two equal partners sharing a life together  right but im the bride so i win  i mean seriously claudia and stuart  i mean ive hooked up with the odd lass who was beneath my level of attractiveness  but you know i was drunk  theres no way claudia has been drunk for three years  you know ive always found that the best way to get over a failed relationship  is to celebrate someone elses successful one  oh it makes sense  so with that in mind uh our friends claudia and stuart  are having this crazy blacktie wedding on saturday  you want to be my plus one  ooh plus one you make it sound so romantic  fine  you want to be my date  your date  id love to  how fancy are we talking about here  oh youre going to want to bring your a game  oh ill bring it  ill bring it so hard the brides going to look like a big white bag of crap  lily i need a dress  youre going thats awesome  oh my god four days to find a dress  i know its a suicide mission  well if we leave now we can still have a fighting chance lets do it  bye babe  whoa did you see how fired up she was  i dont know theres something there  and come saturday a little music a little dancing a lot of champagne  who  knows  wow ted youre going to have to find another gender for yourself  cause im revoking your dude membership  yeah how was that manicure yesterday  invigorating thanks  okay i wasnt going to say it in front of the guys  but  back then i really thought thats how it worked  you put yourself and a girl you like in some romantic setting  the stars line up  and shazam  i know now that life is never that simple  hey claudia  yes i want tahitian vanilla you wrote it down wrong  no no no no listen

ready for a relationship deep down youre single  its your default setting  ted you know whats in the back of your brain  oh great here comes the little barney speech  behind a curtain in a dark little room secretly controlling your every move   a little barney  a little barney  a little barney  and you know what he said  ted you will bring no dates to this wedding  you will hit on drunk bridesmaids with actualsize barney  wow please stop  i got to call claudia if i just explain to her  ted no let it go  shes about to get married shes got enough to worry about  then what am i going to do  the only thing you can do tell robin she cant come  just a second   hey  hey listen  wait two things first of all i have been laying groundwork all afternoon  totally subtle totally cool not pushing not

friends for a long time  and its 40 his wedding too  i dont know its going to be a tough sell  dude no problem whatsoever  really  sure the more the merrier  wow wow thanks for being so cool about this  cause you know claudia said  yeah yeah yeah this morning at the rehearsal  claudia called our sevenyearold flower girl a whore  so dont take it personally shes just a little stressed  yeah shes not usually like that  no  well thanks stu  its going to be a great wedding  honey this magazine says more and more couples are opting  to have nontraditional weddings out in the woods  well if a magazine says so we should go get married in the woods  like a couple of squirrels  squirrels dont get married marshall  like you could possibly know that  i did it i did it im taking her to the wedding  nice  what how  i talked to stuart  you went around the bride  oh this hornets nest looks harmless  maybe ill poke it with a stick  oh look some gremlins let me go feed them after midnight  did you know about this  it may have been my idea  what  stuart doesnt get a say  ah so you admit it the groom should have an equal say  well yeah sure on the stupid stuff like who comes  so i can invite whoever i want  sure theres plenty of room in the woods  its claudia  so it begins  come on it cant be that bad  here lily you answer it  what why  because this whole thing was your idea  and claudia scares me  but but youre the but i just want to  teds phone  oh hi claudia  what  now i wasnt there but from what i heard it went something like this  oh by the way honey ted stopped by and i told him  he could bring his date to the wedding  you what  always undermining me at every turn  try to show a little flexibility but no  its all about you  and your mother  you know what  the weddings off  they broke up  o w  its not because of me is it  and my dad already paid for this huge wedding  oh hes going to kill me  and then hes gonna kill ted  then im gonna kill ted  its robin

thats great ill tell lily to tell me  uh listen i really want to keep talking um but nows not a good time  so im really excited about tomorrow okay bye  okay bye  crap she bought some expensive shoes shes really looking forward to this   do you think shes into me  ted focus  okay okay sweetie just calm down  do you want to go somewhere and talk  i want to go somewhere and drink  okay meet me at maclarens ill see you there  oh i feel terrible  well feel terrible later right now we gotta fix this  lily you go down to the bar and comfort claudia  ted and i will go and try to talk some sense into stuart  um tell claudia im sorry  did she seem pissed at me  she said if theres no wedding tomorrow you owe her father 400000  what say we get these crazy kids back together  hi sad eyes  whats got you down  stuart and i just broke up  oh god im so sorry thats just thats  two vodka cranberries please  you remembered i drink vodka cranberries  remember  when it comes to you how can i forget  they all drink vodka cranberries  so is there anything else you need sweetie  you got 400000  no  but i do have a hug  thank you  stuart ii dont know what to say if i caused this in any way  ted for all i know you did me the biggest favor anyones ever done me  oh come on man you dont mean that  no i do this whole thing has made me realize i miss being single  i miss staying out late and making messes and not cleaning them up  i miss owning porn  dude who doesnt  and you know ill see some superhot model chick and ill think  why am i with claudia i could be with her  thats just crazy  i mean youre the luckiest you and claudia both  the point is i want to get married i want to settle down  but right now thats just not who i am  im not a commitment guy im a single guy  stuart you dont have to be one or the other  everybody feels this way sometimes  relationships arent easy theyre hard work  its about compromise growing together all that dr phil crap  how would you know youre not even married  okay ask this guy nine years hes been with lily  hes the pro this guy knows relationships  tell him marshall  stuart dont get married   dude  what  look im sorry  being in a couple is hard and committing making sacrifices its hard  but if its the right person then its easy  looking at that girl and knowing shes all you really want out of life  that should be the easiest thing in the world and if its not like that  then shes not the one im sorry  you  know i dont have 400000 right  maybe we got together too young  maybe thats what the problem was  i mean im 28 years old  and ive really only ever been with one man  thats just thats  two more vodka cranberries please  claudia its all gonna be okay  oh thanks for listening barney  it really means a lot to me  isnt it weird that we should run into each other like this  two souls of equal levels of attractiveness  both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle   oh hell no  ow ow ow  claudia is getting married tomorrow  and so help me god if i catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her  i will take those peanuts youre trying to pass off as testicles  and i will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out  and then ill feed them to you like grapes  wait my eyes or my testicles  one of each  all right all right  claudia  stuart  im so sorry  im so sorry too  i love you  i love you too babe  marshall and ted set me straight  and when marshall told me not to marry you it made me realize i  marshall said what  its more complicated than that  he made me realize how much i love you  these guys got us back together  okay im cool im cool  so where did we land on the whole plus one thing  no no no no  it took three more vodka cranberries to subdue claudia  but eventually she graciously agreed to let me bring robin  still wow  wow yourself look who else brought it  oh yeah i thought about leaving it at home  but i figured i dont want to get there and realize i need it  and have to go all the way back to get it so yeah i brought it  oh sorry  hello  oh my god tonight  youre kidding  they want me to anchor the news tonight  really  like anchor anchor  what happened to sandy  okay  okay sure what time do you need me to  right now oh  do it  do it  okay i need like five minutes to change and um ill call you from the cab  so admit it  this wedding is both indoors and amazing  ill give you the crab puffs the crab puffs are good  the crab puffs were incredible  we should totally have them at our wedding  definitely  hey we just agreed on something  did we just start planning our wedding  i think that we did  we totally have to get that brown dipping sauce  ooh i thought the red sauce was like awesome  my god were you born without taste buds  what  i love you  coming up are there snakes living in your walls  the answer may surprise you after the break  man you know something stuarts my new hero  if that dude can bag a nine  i got to be able to bag like a 16  whats a 16  those two eights right over there  yeah  hi ted  claudia  we just wanted to get a picture with the woman who almost ended our relationship  yeah where is she  um she couldnt make it  whats so funny  oh plan a wedding youll see  look at that  thats how its supposed to be that right there  easy simple  its just not like that with robin  its not easy and on some level it has to just be easy  speaking of easy bridesmaids ted bridesmaids  by the way i almost forgot  we found this  i didnt check plus one  you were right  of course i was right  im single  maybe thats just who i am  and you know what i like being single  being singles the best  yeah stay out as late as you want  answer to no one  the whole world full of endless possibilities  never having to go to a farmers market  okay ah doing some math here  table six has got three bridesmaids an eight an eight and a seven  i am willing to give you one of the eights lowering myself to a 15  which means you owe me  so there we were two single guys doing our usual singleguy thing  for whatever reason i had let myself believe that this night would be a turning point  that this was the night my life my real life would finally begin  the funny thing is  i wasnt totally wrong  because that night was just beginning
