sorry  thanks  i know it must be tough  but are you ready to hear something  that will not only make you feel better  but will actively excite you  sure  for the first time ever the three of us are single  at the same time  ive dreamed about this day boys  and its going to be  legendary  together we will own this city  anytime a girl wants to get back at her exboyfriends  well be there  anytime a girl wants to solve her father issues  through promiscuity and binge drinking we will be there  anytime a bachelorette party drives through the city  in a limo sticking their heads out the sunroof shouting  mimicking female voice whats up new york  we will be what is up new york  gentlemen we are about to embark on  aw man you guys did it didnt you  one thing i learned that summer  is that when love is beginning  moans  and love is ending  the first 30 days are remarkably similar  for one thing you spend most of your time in bed  moans  groans  your friends cant stand to listen to you  hes so ticklish  it was a really beautiful song  so stupid man mimicking choking  and you never seem to wear pants  sighs  hey marshall  hey ted  you hungry whats the point  i could eat some food  its just going to leave me  well at least in that scenario you get to do the dumping  come on its sunday  its pancakes day  lily always made the pancakes  god i loved her pancakes  so soft  so warm  so perfectly shaped  are we still talking about her pancakes  come on you got to eat something what can i get you  beer  no thats what you had for dinner  fine  then ill just have leftovers  barney so he stays home  all the time not getting laid  no see  thats what you do when you have a fiance  he should be down here celebrating  hes free  he got that redheaded tumor removed  you should write and illustrate childrens books  you know what marshall needs to do  he needs to stop being sad  when i get sad i stop being sad and be awesome instead  true story  its only been a month  he just needs to go at his own pace  anyway lilys the one who caused this whole mess  hey cut her some slack  shes our friend too  shes just trying to figure out who she is  figure out who she is  yeah she should call me i got a whole list  shes selfish  shes immature  shes  what  god your eyes are so blue  aw teddy bear  mimics sword unsheathing oh thats a  groans  coughs  yeah it was hard to feel too bad  i was dating the woman of my dreams  and things were going great  well for the most part  so i found her shampoo  marshall i guess she left it here  it smells like her  like lavender and seashells and hope  somehow  erotic and comforting all at the same time  thats my shampoo  oh sorry  mmm i thought hed never go to sleep  moans  uhoh  already  hes calling her  i dont hear any hes calling her  no screams  marshall okay youre right i wont call her  i will not call her  well i called her  and get this  she changed her number  what like im going to stalk her  or something like shes so special  like shes the only lily aldrin out there  cause there are four others in the san francisco area alone  and they all seem a lot better than her  based on the brief conversations i had with them  does he know im in here  yeah hey robin  anyways one of the lily aldrins said  this has to stop  ted we just started dating  we agreed we dont want to move too fast  and yet somehow we have a baby  he cant feed himself  he cries a lot he keeps us up all night  have you tried breastfeeding  nailed it  look they were together nine years  its only been a month and a half  he just needs to go at his own pace  he slept on our floor last night ted  he watched a scary movie  it is time for some tough love  we need to get him out of that apartment  he needs fresh air  he needs sunshine  mmm sunshine  announcer over speaker please welcome to the stage sunshine  all right i really dont think this is going to help  do you know why youre not over lily yet  its cause you can still picture her naked  you cant get over a woman until you can no longer  picture her boobs its a scientific fact  the average male brain can only store a finite number  of boob images or bpegs  and your hard drives filled to capacity with lilys  there are a lot of them  well they wont go away until you overwrite them  with images of other womens boobs  now this journey may take  as many as a million boobs  so we begin here tonight my friend  two at a time  those count as four  yeah  this is fun right  were outside its a beautiful day  the indians are winning  i got to admit  it is really nice to be outside  announcer over speaker yankee fans  please turn your attention to the diamond vision  for a special seventhinningstretch surprise  oh no  crowd sighing  applause and cheering  its all a big lie  shes just going to break your heart  crowd booing  you can drag me out of here but she has no soul  weve tried everything baseball strippers  the guy still wont eat a damn pancake  i think hes beyond repair  see this is the problem with guys  you dont know how to deal with heartbreak  oh and whats your prescription dr estrogen  eat haagendazs and watch love actually  till your periods sync up  ted barney laughing  yeah thats the stuff  oh my god  how long have you been doing this  well my dad taught me to me shoot when i was a kid  whenever im feeling lonely or depressed i come here  and it reminds me that  guns are fun  chuckles lightly  um you know ted is kind of against guns  and thats why  teds never going to find out about this  whoa that sounded kind of scary  with me holding a gun didnt it  no ii just mean  please dont tell ted  you want to try  only hell yeah  oh yeah yeah this is what i needed  i felt so powerless this whole time  but this laughs  this is power  this is gasps  i should of

know marshall tried to get me  to play tennis for nine years  but i didnt do it because i never truly loved him  i got you a gift  oh  a ferret  oh ill buy it some food next door at the pet palace  oh ive always wanted one  but marshall had this secret phobia of ferrets  i bet thats something he made you promise not to tell nobody  laughing it was  oh  i love you funk legend george clinton  i love you too lily  thats right marshall shes all mine  now im gonna let her play with my hair   ow we want the funk    give up the funk   thats the craziest thing ive ever heard  yeah why are you afraid of

credit card activity from like two hours ago  but you know dont  why do you talk  why do you talk  barney he needs her password  its not like he has her password  ooh this is good he has her password  theres a charge from earlier today  the kellett hotel on 5th  i dont believe this  lilys back in new york  i cant believe this  lilys in new york  ii guess ive been thinking  when she got back shed

have to get down on my knees  marshall you cant do that oh really why not  ted 56 days  thats how long it took me to get right about here  because youre pathetic  im sorry but right now you are not marshall  you are the miserable  whining shampoosniffing ghost of marshall  and frankly a guy like you  doesnt have a shot in hell with a girl like lily  you know who might have a shot  somewhere down the line  marshall  the real marshall  but if you go down there right now like this youre going  to blow it for him and hes never going to forgive you  of course whatever i say  youre just going to do the opposite  so have a great weekend  good luck screwing up your life  come on robin  clears throat  is it still okay if we borrow the car  bold bold to go for the car  what  i didnt say a thing  you think i was too hard on him  i didnt say a thing scoffs  i cant believe youre accusing me of being too hard on him  youre the one who said tough love  yeah tough love not hand the guy a noose  oh but

knocked out lilys new boyfriend  yeah  it wasnt lilys boyfriend  what who who was it  ted his name was joey adalian although he went by a number  of aliases in his years as an identity thief  apparently earlier in the summer   lily oh this is so embarrassing  ii could have sworn i had some change  i know i know  im sorry  oh here we go  no thatsthats a button  it was a button  do you uh take credit cards  yes i do  so lilys not back in town  and she doesnt have a boyfriend  ththats good news right  yeah  i dont know  those credit card charges  were the only remaining connection i had to her  i dont know where she is or what shes doing  she was my whole life man and now shesshes gone  you know first day of college i showed up  i was so freaked out  andand i got up to my room and there was my roommate  lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall  had headphones on big smile on his face  like he just didnt give a crap  happy  confident not afraid of anything  that guy was you  you before you met lily  ted  yeah  i was high that day  i was  i was so high i thought you were the dean  whwhat im saying is  theres a version of you without lily  and its not this  you cant let lily steal your identity  the way that guy stole hers  okay  okay resolved  starting tomorrow im going to start being okay  chuckles  cheers cheers     but he wasnt  cause thats not how life works  the next day he found one of her socks or something  and we were back to square one  and then one morning  ted i think you should see this  oh no what now  marshall what are you doing  its sunday  its pancakes day  it took him 67 days  and one really disgusting batch of pancakes  so good  mmm so good  but marshall had come back from the dead  because while baseball strippers and guns can help  the only thing that can really heal a broken heart is time   i try to laugh about it    cover it all up with lies    i try to laugh about it    hiding the tears from my eyes    cause boys dont cry
