gonna happen she cant say its not meant to be  it is meant to be and you know why  cause i mean it to be   unpause  unpause  lets pause  see marshall and lily had a rule that at any point during a fight  they could pause and take a break  their fights often lasted for days   a painting fellowship  i was never going to take it   in california  i was never going to take it  ted she is going on that camping trip  dude barring some act of god robins gonna be with sandy this weekend  fine  if an act of god is what it takes  then an act of god it is  what are you talking about  im gonna make it rain  i cant let robin go camping with this guy  so how do i keep that from happening  simple i make it rain  ted do you want me to slap you again  cause i kind of enjoyed it the first time  look ii might be crazy right now no you know what  i am definitely crazy right now but i have a plan  that girl you used to go out with penelope  wasnt she getting her phd in native american culture  yeah  are you still in touch with her  sure i mean even though we stopped having sex  we still get together like once a month to chat and catch up  and of course im not in touch with her  well youre gonna need to get in touch with her  shes gonna teach me how to do a rain dance   did you just say a rain dance  yes   a rain dance  yes   a dance to make it rain  yes   were finding penelope  no we are not  yes we are  ted youre forcing me to be the voice of reason and its not a good look for me  why the hell should i help you  come on i know it didnt work out between us but we did have a relationship  we had sex twice in your car and then you dumped me  how is that a relationship  twice   barney there is no way  shh  seriously come on  penelope i really need to make it rain this weekend  why  theres this girl  theres this girl  you know the traditional rain dance is a sacred prayer to nature  i dont think the great spirit looks too kindly on white dudes who coopt it to get laid  penelope this is the girl i love  if it doesnt rain this weekend shes gonna end up with the wrong guy  please  this wrong guy is he a huge jackass  absolutely   kind of like barney  kind of   hey  you hit on my mom  we werent exclusive  im in  and so the three of us headed up to the roof of my building  okay  crouch down and bend over a little bit  wow it took five shots of tequila to get you in that position  i will throw you off this roof  theres so much of your mom in you  and shes been throwing up ever since  so howd she manage to eat so much chocolate  remember that guy ted that i was telling you about  well i came home and i found him waiting in my apartment  with a string quartet and roses and chocolates  oh thats so sweet  okay yes its sweet in theory but isnt it also kind of crazy  i mean a string quartet in my living room who does that  nobody does that  exactly  no honey nobody does that  but i guess im just a hopeless romantic  im gonna put my hand up your dog now  so youre saying you would forbid me from going  forbid who said forbid  i was just reminding you that theres this wedding coming up in a couple of months  and i was kind of hoping youd save the day  look for me ill be the guy in the awesome suit  come on lily its what youve always wanted  yeah but theres a lot of things ive always wanted and i havent done any of them  im sorry i just need to do this before settling down forever  so now weve gone from i was never gonna do it to i need to do this  did i leave the room at some point when did that happen  oh maybe when you said you wouldnt let me do it  i never said that  you know if youre having these kind of doubts now  whats gonna change in three months  maybe we just shouldnt get married at all  maybe not   pause  pause   so are you just like starving  totally  red lobster  oh lobster lobster lobster you are delicious  oh god i love butter sauce theres nothing bad about it  say something bad about butter sauce i dare you  i wouldnt dare  marshall no were on pause  theres no crying in pauseland  pauseland is a magical place with  with popcorn shrimp mountains and butter sauce rivers  damn it  happy happy happy happy happy happy birthday  happy happy happy happy appy happy birthday  happy happy  ted this is funny  still funny  still fu and now its sad  hey penelope you sure im doing this right  i think so  does it uh look anything like a real rain dance  i think so  hey penelope have you uh have you ever actually seen a rain dance performed  no  no  ive read extensively on the subject  firsthand accounts theoretical criticism the anthropological  have you ever seen a rain dance  ive seen a film strip  terrific uh look i should run  im getting brain surgery from some guy whos seen a couple episodes of er  i cant believe this  weve been up here for the past hour making complete asses of ourselves  what do you mean we white man  how did we get here  couple of days ago the biggest problem in my life was  did ted eat the last pudding snack pack in the fridge  i think theres still one left  dibs   unpause  unpause  look i know this sucks  its just something im going through  im not asking you to understand it  im not asking you to be happy about it  im just asking you to support it  i want to lily okay  i really do  but i just cant  why not  because youre scaring the hell out of me thats why not  what if you decide to go be a painter  and then you realize i dont fit in to your life anymore  and three months becomes forever  can you promise me that thats not gonna happen  marshall  cause if you cant promise me that we shoul just break up right now  im not gonna wait around for three months just to have my heart ripped out  marshall i love you  can you promise me that thats not gonna happen   pause  no lily we cannot pause this anymore  can you promise me that thats not gonna happen   pause  why do you want me to pause  thats just a great use of the pause function baby  thank you  hey ted  whatcha doing  a rain dance  dude thats not a rain dance thats a fat kid with a bee in his pants  look i highly doubt the great spirit is a stickler for choreography  its the thought that counts  shes leaving in half an hour  these are your awesome years youre wasting them on this girl  this isnt gonna work  yeah i know that   well then why are you doing this  because i love her  i love her  i told her that the first night we went out  and here it is eight months later and nothings changed  so yes i know this isnt gonna work  but it has to work  you hear me universe  this is ted mosby talking
