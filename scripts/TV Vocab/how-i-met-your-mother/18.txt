big glass  sure  so hows it hanging  have you ever had one of those days where nothing at all that monumental happens  but by the end of it you have no idea who you are anymore  or what the hell youre doing with your life  do you ever have one of those days  uh about once a week  i dont know it was just a a rough day  and the only person i wanted to see at the end of it was you  so um how was the big phone call with your girlfriend  when the clock strikes 200 just go to sleep  we broke up  what  yeah yeah she finally called  we talked for a while how hard long distance is  and then she dumped me  oh ted im so sorry thats just terrible i feel awful  youre smiling  am i no im not  im a news anchor  smilings a part of the job  thousands died in a tragic avalanche today  see  youre smiling too  yeah  i have no idea what thats all about   theres got to be a morning after   how much does korean elvis rock  ill answer that  infinity  he rocks infinity  okay its time for bed  what no its 230  nothing good ever happens after 200 am  you know i have found in my travels  that all the best things in life happen after 200 am  when i look back at the best stories of my life  the liberty bell incident the little scrape i got in at the russian embassy   the almost fourway  you never had a fourway  i said almost  all those things happened after 200 am  because after 200 am is when things get audience say it with me legendary  were going home  whats that interesting theory barney but ill need some proof  okay  korean elvis  how would you like to have a drink with me and my friends  rock n roll  and it begins  so um hey i got a new phone  same as yours look  oh yeah do you like it  yeah yeah  this is some solid small talk  i had that other phone and it was good  but i think the whole time a little part of me wanted this phone instead  this phone um  feels right  wow weird  yeah uh i should probably take this  ill be here  hello  ted this is your main man ke  i want you to shake your tail feathers down here asap you dig  sorry about that  was that korean elvis  ill explain later hey were headed down to maclarens  um actually  im at robins  yeah and um i might have done something bad  i just lied and told her i broke up with victoria  ted i dont want to swear in front of korean elvis  but what the bleep are you doing dude  what do you expect from me its robin  victorias great but its robin  ive made up my mind im going to end it with victoria  gonna  yes first thing tomorrow  okay but but as of right now atat 245 am you still have a girlfriend  ted i love you i love robin  but if you do this right now your entire future with her will be built on a crime  just go home ted dont do this the wrong way  i hate how youre always right  its my best and most annoying trait  okay  im coming home ill see you soon   hey  hey  i should probably get going its pretty late   im sorry i  oh oh no i understand  its fine yeah  can i call you tomorrow  totally totally call me tomorrow  okay good night robin  good night ted  oh my god were making out   right  this is crazy  right right  should we go to my room  i mean theres five dogs in there but   yeah  yeah  yeah  i just um i have to run to the bathroom real quick  okay  stop doing that  whatcha doin  im calling you  were breaking up im doing this right now  im coming out of this bathroom a single man  okay  say ted how long do you think that conversations going to be  length of an average pee  no were gonna be on the phone for at least 20 minutes  robins out there shes gonna think youre in here taking a massive  what do you want from me  people break up it happens  not like this  not from the bathroom of the girl that youre about to sleep with  its not ideal  meanwhile back at the bar  barney was still trying to prove that good things can happen after 200 am  come on lily  how many women can say theyve been personally serenaded by korean elvis  i think he just spat on me  barney you tried i think thats great but were going   no no come on  yes  dude we haent hit legendary yet were only at the le  we still got the gen the da the ry  okay if were at the le then i say we follow it up with a ts go home  oh wow you just got burned phonics style  no no no no no baby baby baby dont go  just one dance huh  okay seriously  hey i know what you like  and so barney was right the night was legendary  it would come to be known as the time lily kicked korean elvis in the nards  hey you guys remember the time that lily kicked korean elvis in the nards  youre right  i owe you a real breakup call  ill call you tomorrow  good  so youre gonna go home  why should i have to go home  you know theres every chance robins the woman im going to marry  ted  it could happen  and so really whats it gonna matter in 50 years if i jump the gun by one night  look ii know this is a moral gray area but  its robin  and im exhausted  i am im exhausted from pretending im not in love with her  i think that makes this okay  oh please you just want to get laid  yes i do you got me  that is exactly what i want right now and so what  i want this she wants this  its happening and if you have a problem with it dont be in germany  its been nice pretending to talk to you  thanks for not calling me and good night  thats not your phone  this isnt my phone  okay bye  i thought it was mine so i answered it  was it  it was your girlfriend  you might want to call her back  i called victoria from the cab and we broke up  yes  and there you have it kids  the stupidest thing ive ever done  in one night i managed to hurt two people i cared about  and none of it wouldve happened if i just listened to my mom  so i guess if theres a lesson to be learned here its this  when its 200 am just go to sleep
