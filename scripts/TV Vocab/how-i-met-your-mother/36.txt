record the game go to the funeral   pay our respects to matt  mark  mark and start watching only an hour late  okay thats great but just to make sure it records  maybe we should bow our heads and say a quiet prayer  to the tivo gods  almighty tivo  we thank you for all the gifts you have given us  the power to freeze live tv to go take a leak  is nothing short of godlike  lets not forget fastforwarding through commercials  it seems greedy to ask anything more from you  o magic box  but if you malfunction and miss the super bowl  we will destroy you in the alley with baseball bats   amen  amen  we are not fastforwarding through the commercials  yeah theyre the best part  oh come on remember last year  who wants to watch a monkey in a coconut bra order a pizza  oh my god this monkey was so cute  seriously thats the last time im gonna call you today  okay  g oodbye  you didnt hang up either  i know you hang up  you hang up  my bookie great guy  so let me get this straight a funeral is the one time you dont suit up  have i taught you nothing ted  virtually  suits are full of joy  theyre the sartorial equivalent of a babys smile  sartorial  of or pertaining to tailors or their trade  suits are for the living  thats why when its my time to rip  im going out of this world the same way i came into it  buck naked yeah  its gonna be awesome  open bar for the guys open casket for the ladies  what up   such a waste  i know  he was so young  a handstitched cashmere doublebreasted dolce  gabbana  it must be so frightened  this is going faster than i thought  well make an appearance at the bar for the wake  well be watching the game by 800  and even though we didnt see any whales  mark and i both said it was the best day of our lives  okay im getting us another round  and when i come back  everyone else is telling their favorite mark story  dibs on the one carl just told  okay i have to be at work exactly one super bowl from now  oh lets face it were not going to get to watch it  we should just find out the score  oh thank god ill find out  no no no we cant we have to watch the game together  its tradition  think of all the great times weve had watching this game  second down everyone drink  ted its not a drinking game  if you drink anytime anything happens  are these chicken wings or angel wings  god i love these things  i love you guys  this is so great all of us watching the super bowl together  this is special  we need to do this every year promise me  calm down buddy  oh commercials  everyone drink  god this is such a great tradition all of us watching the game together  how did this start  hey barney i bet you 20 bucks that casey misses this field goal  i dont bet bettings for suckers  make it like a dollar or something you know who cares no big deal  fine  see there you go he made it you win  wait this is mine  just like that  god that feels good  no that feels really good  what else can we bet on  nothing its the halftime show  oh so lame  nobody even pays attention  i mean janet jackson who cares  god how cool is robin  i cant believe you invited this girl weve only known for a few months  to  our sacred day  now shes gonna be in all the pictures  yeah yeah whatever ill give you the seahawks  plus six points for 500 bucks  are you crazy maybe for 50  50 what fun is 50  why dont we just bet air god marshall  okay 50  hey ill take that action  seahawks but make it four points and make it a grand  hey these wings are they chicken wings or angel wings  oh commercials  monkey with a coconut bra hilarious  look we always watch the super bowl together  so we make a pact to watch it tomorrow at 600  and go the next 18 hours without finding out who won  thats impossible  im not gonna lie to you its not gonna be easy  that means no tv no internet  no newspapers nothing  media blackout  but our tradition lives on  whos in   im in  im in   im in  what the hell im in   high five  dude were at a wake  sorry solemn low five  as the day began none of us had any idea how hard it would be  to go nine hours without hearing the outcome of the super bowl  i decided to work from home to avoid contamination  by the outside world  hey  take this key and swallow it  what no  come on ted you eat salads itll be out by game time  lots more no  im not messing around theodore  ive got a lot of money riding on this game  if i dont handcuff myself to this radiator  ill check the score please take the key  fine  but only because you didnt think through a bathroom plan  and i think thats funny  the media blackout was particularly hard on robin  because well she was the media  but unfortunately the city wont be fixing  the unusually large pothole any time soon  so buckle up if youre on the bqe  its gonna be a bumpy one  like morning commutes needed to get any harder  youre right kevin  well robin what do you say i think its time to check in with sid   for a sports update  no   what  no  but its uh time for sports  no its not its time for weather  we we just did weather  well weathers pretty fickle  it may have changed  whats it doing out there lou  pretty much the same thing it was two minutes ago  back to you robin  okay now its time for sports  no lets go to traffic todd  in the metro news  robin its time for sports  over to you sid  thank you kevin and robin  lets talk about the super bowl  weeks earlier marshall had promised lily  hed come into her kindergarten class for showandtell day  and hes a little bit doublejointed  and his favorite animal is the loch ness monster  lily how many times  nessie is a gentle creature  were trying to stay away from terms like monster  well i think we can all agree he is much more interesting  than sallys oneeyed goldfish  three weeks in a row come on sally  okay well thats all the time we have  arts and crafts everybody  hey im doug  oh hey im marshall  are you going to be staying  here for the rest of day  yeah im actually trying to hide out  cause i dont want to know who won the super bowl  i know who won  oh um thats great but i really dont want to know  so if you could just keep that to yourself  how badly do you not want to know  excuse me  ten  bucks  are  you serious  just went up to eight  unlock me ted  ive never gone this long without calling my bookie  he worries  not until game time  where are you going  pick up the hot wings  what how the hell are you planning on getting  in and out of a sports bar without seeing the score  theres tvs everywhere  ah dont worry  i got it all planned out  first of all  i placed duct tape on a pair of sunglasses  so i can only see out of two tiny holes  next i constructed blinders out of an old cereal box  top it all off hightech noisereducing headphones  i bought when marshall and lily first got back together  and were doing it a lot  i call it the sensory deprivator 5000  hello uh my name is ted mosby  im here to pick up my hot wings  in my hand youll find the exact total for the wings  plus a generous tip  please take the cash  put the wings in my hand and ill be on my way  thank you  and that closes the book on one heck of a super bowl  back to you kevin and robin  well be right back  and were clear  im sorry  um robin is it just me  or were you doing something different there  i havent watched the game yet  im begging you for the rest of the newscast

blow it  yeah i didnt know and now i do know  theres no point in even watching the game  well at least the commercials arent ruined  wings are still good  beer still works  ah what the hell  lets watch barney lose some money  hey so check this out  i got extorted by a fiveyearold today  i almost got fired today  i met emmitt smith today  ooh you go first  i tried out the sensory deprivator 5000  yeah go ahead barney  well i was frantically running down the street  trying to find out the score to the game  and heres the funny part  as unforgettable as that super bowl was  here it is 23 years later and i dont remember who won  hell i dont even remember who played  what i do remember is that we drank beer  we ate wings and we watched the super bowl together  because sometimes even if you know how somethings going to end  that doesnt mean you cant enjoy the ride  we even raised a toast to good old mike  i mean mark matt  crap why do i keep doing that  i didnt only lose the game i lost every single prop bet  total penalty yardage number of replaychallenges  coin toss  what are the odds of losing the coin toss   interceptions fieldgoals total sacks  whether or not thered be a safety first
