                kids never underestimate the power of destiny  because when you least expect it the littlest thing  can cause a ripple effect that changes your life  take for instance my trip to chicago  that security guard was a little bit handsy  thats funny she barely touched me  uh gate 23 come on  if we miss this flight i will never forgive myself  why was this flight so important  lets back up a few months to the fall of 2006  i had just sold my first building design and become  the youngest project manager in my firms history  suddenly i was being headhunted  one firm was even considering me to run their entire new york office  they were flying me in for a final interview  at their corporate headquarters in chicago  it was the opportunity of a lifetime  it was my destiny  there was just one problem  hi wait two more  sorry youre too late i already shut the doors  well im sure if we pull real hard we can open them  hmm i wish it worked like that but see once i close those doors thats it  nobody else is allowed down that jetway  except for that guy  please ifif i miss this flight ill miss the chance to interview for my dream job  im sorry sir  his dream job didnt you ever have a dream job  something from when you were a little girl that was all you wanted to do  i mean for gods sakes im sure you didnt go to bed at night  dreaming about being a  i mean uh  this is a cool job  please i have to be on this flight  ill see what i can do  but it doesnt look good  thanks  your uniforms are pretty      okay  they havent armed the doors yet so you still have a chance  its up to the captain now and theyre calling us back  great please let us know soon as you hear anything  sure and for the future we recommend you arrive  at the airport an hour and a half before your flight  not you know one minute after  normally im incredibly responsible  i just had to go to court this morning and get sentenced  not that im a criminal or anything  yeah he just jumped a subway turnstile  you seem to have a lot of problems with the rules of travel  hello  oh that is great news  its my mom she found her missing earring  have a seat ill call you when i hear something  where was it  that thing better have call waiting  could you just call the firm and explain what happened  its down to three people  and i know they need to make their decision today  i sort of feel my not showing up might put me at a disadvantage  im so stupid  why did i have to jump that turnstile  hey dont be so hard on yourself  and isnt this whole thing really barneys fault  she had a point  it was kind of barneys fault  lets back up a few months  oh marshall hows the broken toe  oh man it kills  you  want some aspirin baby  you know i dont believe in pain killers  wow your first broken bone  kind of kills your whole unbreakable theory  marshall used to think he was indestructible  well it added up ive never broken anything  ive never been sick and when i need to  i can summon incredible strength  ted tell her the story of the really heavy door  there was a really heavy door  he opened it  on one pull  well you must be really bummed youre not gonna be able to run tomorrow  yeah it sucks  all that work i put in training for the marathon was a total waste  training for a marathon  what  you dont need to train for a marathon you just run it  youre kidding right  not at all i could run a marathon anytime i wanted to  so like tomorrow you think you could wake up roll out of bed  and just run the new york city marathon  absolutely  barney were talking about 42 kilometers  thanks canada ill take it from here  barney its like 26 miles  heres how you run a marathon  step one you start running  there is no step two  okay you know what prove it  take my number and run in my place  i will bet you 50 bucks you dont even finish the race   gee grandpa if i win  maybe i can buy myself an icecream cone  make it 10000  you have a gambling problem youll bet me 50  fine then no bet  okay 50  the next morning as the marathon began  we were focused on marshalls computer  each runner gets a tracking chip so you can follow them online  see when they pass certain checkpoints barneys got mine in his shoe  ooh hes starting  this ought to be good  wow  hes already passing the second checkpoint  this tracking thing is amazing  when we get married youre getting one of these  wow look at his time its pretty impressive  hes gotta be cheating okay  he knew wed check  yeah hell do anything to win a bet  remember that time he bet me that men at work sang hungry like the wolf  and when he found out that they didnt he tried to hire them to  well it looks like barney should be coming over the queensboro bridge  and up first avenue within  the next hour or so but  there is no way that thats really him  its really him  hey thats mine  yeah youd better run   what up nonfinishers  wow   very impressive barney  right  yeah my time would have been like a half an hour better  but i met this total hottie on mile seven we took a quick detour  and had our own mini marathon behind a nathans  i  won  im not sure anyone in that story is a winner  so wheres my 50 bucks  all right  i got to admit you earned this  huh cant believe they havent made a coin for this yet  anyway im heading home  might go hit the gym  oh hey just so you know uh all marathon runners get  to use the subway for free today  wow  you know i really should check out this subway  heard so much about it  wow look at me slumming it  maybe ill make a weekend out of it  and ill call my bridge and tunnel girl tonight  youre dating a girl from new jersey  no  so barney did it  he actually finished the marathon  but a little while later i got an interesting phone call   hello  ted its barney  listen to me i need you to come and pick me up on the subway  what what are you talking about  i was sitting here totally minding my own business  finisher  yeah you know what i mean   my legs dont work  ive already ridden the subway twice end to end  ive seen where it turns around  ted you dont ever want to see where the subway turns around  barneys legs wont work  hes riding the subway from end to end  because he physically cant get off the train  best 50 bucks i ever spent  listen to me ted  im going to lose you any second im on the fourth car of the six train  heading south from pelham bay park in the bronx  meet me at the 86th street station in like half an hour  all right ill be right there  stay where you are  ted ted  oh come on youre not even going to give up your seat for him  im sorry i cant  douche   barney  ted  hey  no  see if barney never tried to run the marathon  you never would have jumped that turnstile  you wouldnt have had that court date today  and we would have made this flight  youre right  everything can be traced back to him  like that rash we all got at christmas  all right i have to see whats going on   so i was able to get you two seats  really thats great  no no not you im talking to my mom about blue man group  ma can i call you back  okay what about our flight can we get on  im still waiting for huh  looks like your flight left already  what no nnnno nno i have to be in chicago today  well he never even called you back  well its typical pilot they dont call you back at work  and they dont call you back after you spend two nights with them  at a radisson in orlando  it turned out there was one other flight that would just barely get me  to chicago on time for my job interview  but it was all the way on the other side of the airport  what was the name of the airline again  i think it was something like flights r us  was the r backwards  god i hope not   geez  stupid smart carts  more like dumb carts  if we miss this flight its all barneys fault  you know barney never would have run the marathon in the first place   if marshall hadnt broken his toe  yeah so  what you think this is my fault  for marshall the initial idea to run the marathon came way back in april  my pants are starting to feel a little tight  oh thats okay i love that cute little belly  i cannot allow this  what  i am going to run the new york city marathon  it is important to load up on carbohydrates  two to four hours before a big run  try a breakfast of a bagel a banana  oatmeal strawberries and some orange juice  here you go marshmallow just like the book said  yeah but from now on im eating all of my breakfast runnerstyle  liquids are digested faster  that way no energy is wasted  and its all about the run  dont forget to give yourself plenty of positive reinforcement  this is gonna be your best run yet  youre going to accomplish all of your goals  you are a robot sent from the future  to win the marathon  you are marshall  you are marshall  you are marshall yeah  chafing or blisters can occur in a number of areas  including the feet armpits or even the nipples  try using some petroleum  jelly on the affected areas  oh gosh  dude you are a terrific runner  tomorrow youre gonna run and finish the new york city marathon  youre the best  you look good  nobody does it better than you  marshall oh my god  so yes it was your fault  i  mean if you dont show up at the apartment in the middle of the day  marshall doesnt break his toe barney doesnt run in his place  i dont jump the turnstile and get a court date  and we make our flight in plenty of time  and i dont fall down and bite my tongue at the airport  that really wasnt my fault  i  wouldnt have walked in on marshall if it werent for lily  hey think about it  hey whats going on here  oh looks like theyre camping out for something  yeah but for what  i dont know usually theres a stormtrooper or klingon in line  to give you some indication  annual wedding dress blowout  designer sample dresses up to 90 off  doors open tomorrow 800 am  oh my god can you believe what some nut bags will do to save a few bucks  we have to camp out   are you serious  you dont understand  this is an amazing sale ive heard about it before  but i never knew where it was  well have a wedding dress campout itll be fun  i cant go ive got this thing   what thing  a penis   this is the place  oh wow  badgley mischka melissa sweet  vera wang  oh robin do you have any idea what you guys stumbled onto here  you said wang  oh this reminds me of the ticket line to lilith fair 1998  only fewer mullets  you should feel good youre only like the tenth craziest bride in new york  ooh this is comfy  we might actually be able to sleep  thats kind of annoying  well im sure somebody will be out here to turn it off any minute  i dont think i can take this  every time it turns off i think  oh maybe it wont turn on again  but then it does  why does it robin  why does it keep turning on  its gonna be okay sweetie why  why dont we make a game out of it okay  why dont we sing along  if we get through this  i swear im gonna live my life differently  i just want to tell my parents i love them one more time  morning ladies   its him its the car guy  get out of here  the next morning robin was too tired to go all the way back to brooklyn  so while i was at work  she went to crash at my apartment for a couple hours  and thats when  nobody does it better than you  marshall oh my god  so if lily hadnt dragged me down to the wedding dress store  we would have made the first flight  oh thank god the doors are still open we made it  hi please we really need to get on this flight  oh my god  youre that reporter from metro news 1  yes yes i am  i cant believe you recognized me   you did that story on the giant pizzas  would you check to see   if you have any more seats  one moment sir  were those pizzas real come on were they   robin  one second ted  um you know a lot of people ask me that  the truth is the pizzas were real   calzones trick photography  i knew it  god it is so nice to meet a fan  and i would be a fan of your work if you could get us  two seats on that next flight  well the uh flight attendants are just finishing up their final seat count  let me see what i can find out  would it help if i got on and gave an impassioned speech about my destiny  i think it might hurt  this is such a nightmare  okay so we agree this goes back to lily wanting to camp out  for a wedding dress  no  wait it goes back further   remember why we were eating hot dogs on the east side   this pennys from 1939  a 67yearold penny  do you realize this penny was minted during world war ii  oh so was my grandfather but that doesnt make him interesting  look i know a little something about coins  and  this baby is worth something to a collector   no its not  yes it is  you know what im gonna take you out to dinner  with the money i get for this little guy  and thats exactly what i did  youre lucky theres still a place that serves anything for a dollar fifty  hey thats 150 times its original value  actually the meal was only 149   hey in 50 years we can get dinner again  how dare you  hey whats going on  i dont know looks like theyre camping out for something  yeah but for what  it was me  i started this  if i hadnt picked up that penny  we wouldnt have gone to get hot dogs all the way across town  and we wouldnt have seen that wedding dress store  lily wouldnt have wanted to camp out there  and i wouldnt have needed a nap at your apartment the next day  marshall wouldnt have broken his toe  barney wouldnt have run the marathon  i wouldnt have jumped that turnstile  gotten arrested had that court date  and we would have made our flight  i dont think we can go back any further than that  unless you know who dropped the penny  i wish i did  though that persons already been punished enough  losing a sweet penny like that  uh sir  oh please tell me you have some good news  uh im afraid not  there are no extra seats on the plane  im sorry  all right well thanks for trying  i cant believe this  thats it its over  ted come on  your destiny just wasnt to make it to chicago today  anyway if that firm really wants you theyll reschedule  but thats not what happened  they didnt reschedule  they hired someone else  and as it turned out three months later  that guy ended up having to relocate to chicago  kids funny thing about destiny  i thought i was destined to get that job  but i was wrong  my destiny was to stay in new york  because if i hadnt  i never would have met your mother
