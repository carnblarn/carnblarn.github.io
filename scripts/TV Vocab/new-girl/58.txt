to find out my final answer   whoa  what  im sorry youre in such a pickle  but im not sorry that i get to time something    all right  just to be clear 19 minutes until 600  im not sure this is helping  this brings a whole new level of tension to the whole situation  yeah because youre being timed now   you time a lot of stuff coach  46 seconds  this is a lifechanging decision thats it   coach do you always wear a stopwatch like always  you familiar with rollergirls relationship to her skates in boogie nights   yes  well im not  because i dont watch movies i time them  theyre pornographers but theyre also a family  my round ass  jess choosing a career path is never easy  but what i found   oh my god  shut up dude  shes looking for career advice  your job could be done by a vending machine  guys dont be mean  so nick doesnt have a traditional career i mean  or is it the most traditional  maybe im thinking about prostitution  guys as you all know i am the expert at changing career paths  is this something were now bragging about  no schmidt im referring to my decision  to quit playing the game of basketball  jess i will tell you this it was not easy  it all began back  come on winston move it along  okay jess fine  but dont blame me if you get lost in the nooks and crannies  of this crazy english muffin we call winstons life  i was the ninth guy off the bench  for the eighthbest team in latvia  winnie the bish winnie the bish  winnie the bish  haha thanks for coming to watch me play guys  we didnt watch you play we watched you sit  which was still fun  you know any chance to get to latvia right guys  yeah i havent played all year  they barely let me practice but you know like i always say  how about them lats  so thats when you decided to change course  that makes sense so my takeaway from that is  still building to the decision  you are traded to kraslava city  the outdoor league  man they play on a hillside  i give you surprise tip uphill basket better  aha and then you decided  ah  im going fast  whoa whoa whoa  you never play basketball again  dont touch it stop it  and thats when i decided to stop playing the game of basketball  jess walk away the moment you stop loving it  i mean thats what i did  thats the thing you didnt walk away  you decided nothing that story contains zero decisions  look i decided to stop playing the game of basketball  when my doctor told me i had to stop  okay okay all right i it was my decision  mmhmm  to start to play the game of basket  you were handed a basketball six seconds after you were born  damn do i even like basketball  i mean goodness  have i ever made any decisions my whole life  are we all just living inside the mind of a giant  all right good job buddy really good thanks  you know if i may be so bold  oh nick please winston have a seat  i was literally about to give advice  she already heard one cautionary tale tonight  she does not need to hear another   what she needs to hear is my story  all right  a story of hard choices a story of paths taken  a story that i like to call kablamo mcyeah bro  ah you stupid bast  the title has nothing to do with the story but you need a hook   it all began back  come on schmidt  what only one story in the whole wide world  can begin in a hospital  i volunteered a lot in college  but i shone brightest as a candy striper  sick people wanted me  dying people wanted to be me  i was the total candystriping package  and yet i remained invisible  to the one whose gaze i desired the most  invisible you were like a 300pound wall of peppermint bark  her badge said rn for registered nurse  but as far as i was concerned it said nilth  nurse id like to hug  not even the baggiest of scrubs could hide her splendid form  wheres a guy have to volunteer to get a girl like that huh  i dont volunteer im a man  i have a job in marketing  obviously i was far too fat to work in marketing  so i got a job any dumb slob could do  relax man its your first day  for a jewish giant i had a surprising knack  for selling christmas trees  not only did my wide center of gravity  make me freakishly strong  but i could also sell like the wind  because i understood one fundamental truth  when youre buying christmas trees  youre really buying sex  have you always been short ive always been fat  but who cares how god made you  dont let him put you in a skin box  at the end of the day im just a fat guy  standing here in front of a short guy telling him  that i think we found his tree  it wasnt long before i caught the attention of old man mccue  christmas tree king of syracuse  inventor of triple netting  however  in the words of the late great sir billy joel  billy joel is definitely alive  and hes definitely not a knight  the good they do die young  as i walk through the valley of the shadow of death   i take a look at my life and realize theres nothin left   cause ive been blastin and laughin so long   that even my mama thinks that my mind is gone but   when youre on your deathbed  when your life has been lived  youre never gonna say  i wish id spent more time with my family  because money and everything it buys  you can take it  with you  interesting money  actually the museum job pays more than the teaching job  wait the m  then what the hell are we talking about here you guys  done deal case closed  follow them ducats  its not always about the money schmidt  guys look its almost 600  and candace is insanely punctual  you know one of the best  career choices of the future  driveways  youre welcome   jess the museum job pays more  all right   the decision has been made for you  no no no  you dont know the difference between more and less   dont you  yes schmidt  all of my decisions have been made for me  im only in sports radio because i played professional basketball  i played professional basketball  because somebody put a ball in my crib as a baby  what if somebody gave baby winston a flower  then what would i be   beekeeper  hummingbird farmer  oh does water shoot out of the flower  if so youd be a hilarious comedian  wait guys this is classic after 600 topics  look i there has to be more to this than money  i really want to care about what i do  dont you ever miss getting your hands dirty   and selling  ive moved up in the world  im not freezing and covered in sap  im making spreadsheets  its like old man mccue used to say  the reward is in the destination  its not in the journey  was he wise or was he senile  because hes mixed up a lot of really wellknown sayings  jess youre gonna want to listen to me  anyone else here named after their career  people call you markety  not yet  thats too bad cause thats awesome  no no no no no no no  hands up ulvis  ball screen vlad come on  there we go yes  bishop finger out of your nose now  ernies a really good coach   maybe we should call him coach  we should probably call him  you do it first   yeah  uh
