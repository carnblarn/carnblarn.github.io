actually more there than meets the eye  um there was a bird hes not in the shot  but he was injured  and he couldnt get out of the road and so i braked and then  i had to accelerate out of the intersection  you missed your first court date on this  my exboyfriend failed to send it to me  before the court date  because he doesnt believe in mail  which has to do with his thoughts on government spending  now its an 800 fine  thats why i need like a really awesome lawyer like you  so can you help me  i mean i can try you never know  a judge might buy into this whole thing so  what

learning right out of her mouth  okay this is getting excessive guys  shes actually helping her get out of a ticket  by being condescending and judgmental  what did she say  ugh just drop it nick  okay what did julia do wrong  its just how girls fight sometimes  theres a lot unsaid  like one time a girl said to me  jess you rock a lot of polka dots  ooh how did she say it  jess you rock a lot of polka dots  that is diabolical im really sorry  and it ruined our friendship  i mean i couldnt get over the polka dot incident  warning spoiler alert  somebody unplugged my dehumidifier  to plug in their flatiron  i will be putting my dehumidifier and my towel  in my room where nothing ever gets wet  all right you know what jess julias one of those girls  where she doesnt have like a lot of girl friends  because she thinks like a guy she doesnt play mind games  so blind look all i know  is shes totally up front with me  no subtext no codes  oh okay so did she come right out and ask you  if you were seeing other girls  because she asked me  she did you didnt know that  cause i thought you guys were so up front with one another  i thought you guys told each other everything yeah  she told him she didnt want to label it  oh i mean thats a classic move  even in the lesbian community  what are we talking about  did you just hear the phrase lesbian community  and come running out of your room  i did uh  question for you  this community you speak of  do the ladies look uh  more like this one or you know  kind of nickish aw shut up schmidt  i did date a woman who looked a lot like nick  you did felicia  why cant you just admit that shes your girlfriend  i know i just thought  it was uncomplicated and now im freaking out  im not good at being a boyfriend  im good at being that guy

dating other people and i just you know  wanted to see if you were also dating other people  youre dating other people yeah yeah  no no im seeing other people too  good good  im having sex all the time im like a mailman  except instead of mail its hot sex that i deliver  ive had to start carrying like  athletic shoes in my purse  cause i have to sprint from one sexual encounter to another  cant wear heels  well im having sex right now  under the bar  and shes on top  so figure that out  was that her yeah  well great great  then were both doing the exact same thing  and were on the same page
