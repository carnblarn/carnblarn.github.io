michael keaton  you stupid  michael keaton the actor the batman  nick are you gonna tell her or should i   im not telling her  fine ill do it   you will  when schmidt was seven years old  youre a terrible storyteller ill just do it myself i guess  when schmidt was seven years old  his daddy divorced his mommy  and schmidt was left without the love of a father  he didnt take it well  he began an endless cycle of crying and chocolate  mrs schmidt tried everything to cheer him up but nothing worked  desperate she looked to the stars movie stars  mrs schmidt wrote that little fat loser a letter of support from the star  of his favorite movie batman  but not the confusing new one the good one with michael keaton  and when schmidt got his disgusting chubby hands on keatons letter  his life changed forever  yes  but the real trouble was just beginning  you see schmidt wrote back and he kept writing back  about any problem he faced bullies schoolwork  public erections  and for every letter he sent michael keaton sent one back  was winstons version shorter  then one day that tubby goon went off to college  whoa  so mrs schmidt unloaded the secret on her sons only friend  a man named me it was me   yeah i got that  really people dont  no i got it  college proved tough for schmidt and old patterns soon returned  it became impossible to study and i knew what i had to do  and again   new message  it worked  with keaton in his corner he pulled himself away from that bag of turkey   and became a man  one  he lost five pounds gained confidence with women  and he saw the hit movie multiplicity   25 times  oh my god  youve been cat fishing schmidt  do you think we could use this whole michael keaton thing   to turn schmidt around  absolutely   great  but i wont do it   why not  because i put it to bed okay  its over hell do anything keaton says  the letters are too powerful  im lying to my best friend  and i also feel like im betraying the real keaton who i really love  well then why did you tell me that whole story nick  because its a great story and im a teller of stories  but i wont do it sorry  you think you tell that story better than me  look you leave out way too many details man  you dont just say he was chewing a candy bar  you say he was chewing on a nougaty candy bar  thats not the kind of writer i am i dont say words like nougaty  im simple im like hemingway   hey cece  oh hey  i came to find out if youre coming to my party today  you never answered my email  yeah i meant to uh to tell you i cant make it  sorry um  ive been going out drinking a lot lately its kind of wiping me out  please come to my party cece  its schmidt you know   i dont think im ready for that so  yeah  what if i could promise you schmidt wouldnt be there  who wants candy   did you go trickortreating  no  i was out i had my errand tote and a couple of neighbors gave me candy  is that trickortreating  yes thats the definition of trickortreating jess  hello uh jess id like you to know that ive changed my mind  and i wont be coming to your party tonight  ive been emailing with an old friend of mine and he made me realize   that i should give cece her space  an old friend huh  well nick knows you know i dont like to throw his name around  because i dont like people treating me any differently but  its michael keaton  what  uh okay calm down  the actor  seriously you guys dont treat me any different  hes kind of my friend michael keaton  there was one time he emailed me he said he was my best friend  anyway we have so much catching up to do  me and michael so just enjoy the night  thats crazy schmidt ah man   what did you do  jessica damn day  i just got schmidt to not come to the party  keaton hasnt written schmidt in three years  we have no idea how schmidt is gonna react  if schmidt finds out keaton isnt real  itll destroy the entire life he has built around him  we are talking about a truman show situation  oh yeah i love that movie what part are you talking about  well im talking about the part in the movie  when truman realizes that his whole life is a lie  and then he goes crazy  yeah yeah yeah right there in the middle of the movie  no its the whole movie  oh yeah i know i was just cause theres the one   theres like a scene  you havent seen it  he didnt see the movie okay guys he almost found out once  now luckily i handled it  i dont understand  in 1995 he told me specifically that he had never been to nicaragua  it doesnt make any sense aah  you have no idea what youve done  hey uh you guys do you think that its too early to email michael back  should i send him an ecard  does that change anything or does that change everything   i think youre overthinking it  you know what   youre right youre right  be cool  i think im way too up here all upstairs  got to bring it down here to here  not any lower though its not like that   i know its not  bro its not like that   no one thinks it is bro  cool  all right  hes already getting weird   here  no je  you come to the master  what are you writing  i fixed it again youre welcome again  so you just wrote from keaton  im going on vacation  he would never write that jess   why not  vacation  oh michael you stop going away  i knew this would happen   hey schmidt  schmidty  he left me again  it makes sense  why would a guy like michael keaton be friends with me anyway  im sure he likes you a lot schmidt  why would he  i guess ill just always be the fat boy who eats fatboy cheese  i didnt want to have to do this  oh is that really necessary nick   shh  what  let him work im kind of like his robin   youre not like my robin  you want to be robin  he doesnt have all the responsibilities of batman  but he can take some of the glory   robins a joke  robins the joke  i think we can all agree  the kids look up to him you know in the community  i havent been inside keatons mind in a long time  and i need my proper inspiration  thank you  why do you have a picture of a bear  the great michael keaton attacks each new role  with the ferocity of a hungry brown bear  it is his entire acting philosophy which i totally made up  i sleep with this person  speak to me keaton  mmm  here we go  oh hey nick thats incredible  courage is not the absence of fear but the triumph over it  yes i stole that from nelson mandela  i added the part about the penguin and the riddler  oh all right  is that him did it work  he wrote back smiley face   he wrote back smiley face  he wrote back smiley face   trick or treat  oh how adorable  you know i just got a treat
