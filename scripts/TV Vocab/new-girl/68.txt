exactly  the problem is the solution  do you know what i mean  thats like a cool sentence but  its more just stay busy right  thanks tran  if id met you in your prime during the war  that would have been glorious  but then we wouldve been enemies  and tried to murder one another  unless we formed an alliance  oh  you and me forming an alliance  in an oldschool war  thats a fantasy  or a novel  you just gave me another idea  winston  ive been thinking about it  and a banquet is not big enough  youre not retiring from some  insurance company  so what do you really want  besides a piata  dream
