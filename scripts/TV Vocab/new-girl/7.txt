never played handbells before  i just pick things up easy thats all  i know handbells arent the coolest instrument in the world  they might not even be the fifth coolest  but the kids would love it it

we could use to talk about  whispers nick  while hes right there well be like  nicks such a tinkle  i think hes more like a tonkel  tinkle and tonkel are potential   bell talk we could use  i get it  just be cool please  i am cool  before you make your decision  id only need you till the concert on sunday  bell dings  i dont know i think i could be into this   yay  and with  that statement he
