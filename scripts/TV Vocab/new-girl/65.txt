rooms every night  so what is the difference  its a really big difference  because right now were roommates  but were not living together not living together   you know  no  living together is a step its official  its an official step in a relationship  so the word official is the key  abby and schmidt did it after one week  come on we have so much left to learn about each other  stuff you can only learn if youre crammed together  in a small space and you cant get out  just you and me four walls  no boundaries no escape  when you put it like that it sounds amazing   and like prison  well i

the bed by myself  bigtime  no i went to the hotel to get away from nick  and i wore a robe and i watched a documentary about ethel kennedy  and it was one of the best nights of my life   so you win  your relationships  better than mine and i cant even share a room with nick  i dont win come on  i swing from guy to guy  i dont think i have ever paid my own rent  you travel the world collecting lovers  all my lovers could fit in one suv  and yes maybe somebody would have to sit on someones lap  but they would fit  and youre just brave  you and nick are brave  you guys know each other you get under each others skin  he has the feet of a hippy cult leader  but thats the difference i just throw myself  into whatever comes along because  i really dont want to be alone  why not being alones great  you should try it sometime  seriously it might help you figure yourself out  sighs  youre abby freaking day  you can do whatever you want  except vote  laughs but seriously  you shouldve seen nicks feet  the bottoms are all black except for one patch of yellow  laughs   hey  hey   what are you doing  oh  just packing up your things and then i  thought about what you would want and how you probably didnt  want to move again so i decided to do the right thing  and just take your room   my rooms bigger  is it i never   nice try  all right  i got to move some stuff back then   chuckles  hey  im sorry that this didnt work out   im sorry that we sucked  look we dont suck  im crazy about you but i dont have to spend every second  with you in what amounts to a oneroom log cabin  cabins

pilgrims  then how do you explain my 37page essay about it   i think you made it up in your head  this seems like one of those   agree to disagree moments  no its not   im also older than you  anyway

hindsight maybe we moved a little bit too fast  i just wish that i had realized that   before i rented her a storefront  you rented her a storefront  it was a threeyear lease in an undesirable
