winstons hands  drink it up checkers forget what you saw  never talk about anything serious when youre hungover jess  i dont even really think about it that much  i just think about you know passing things just  nothing specific we live in a house by a lake   that sounds pretty specific  we live in a town  with a sense of history but not so much history  that the locals are suspicious of new people  two small children  who are so incredibly creative they named themselves  we dont need to discipline the kids cause theyre so afraid  of disappointing us  our house smells like cider  and if theres a horse out back  youre not gonna get any guff from me  anyway thats where im at scoffs  what are you what are you thinking  what um  where do you picture us  where do you nick  nick  mmm mmm oh god  i still feel like crap  guys will you um look at this followup text  that im sending to buster   its for the little boy  try to be helpful okay   what are we looking at here  are those nursing

the future   lets just put this toy together  i want to talk about the future   okay great all right  i would love to talk about it yes great  i always thought it would be cool to be a longhaul trucker  you want to be a longhaul trucker with a family  no the family would be in montana oror mars landing  you know if the government finally steps up  where is mars landing  where is mars landing its on m its on mars  its the american capital of mars  and if you dont think theres gonna be space travel  in the next 20 years then youve got your head  buried in sand girlie  its already basically happening  i always thought id move back to portland  oh portland earth  its like friendly san francisco  slow food fast bicycles  great schools  education is very important to me  that makes me happy  its something we agree on   i really want my kids to beg for it  what  cause if you force a kid into school hes gonna hate it  oh no  if you make a kid work  and sit in the yard and grind and grind   and grind  what  eventually that little kid is gonna beg for education  then you hand it to them   like the gift that it should be  no  thats why public schools a joke  im so hungover  and my bodys shutting down  and nothing youre saying makes any sense  there is something serious i have to tell you  about the future  the name of my firstborn child  has to be reginald veljohnson  i lost a bet to schmidt  reginald veljohnson  that is nonnegotiable unfortunately  the dad from family matters  well the actor who plays the dad  the dad is carl winslow  what was the bet on  i said i could flip a big pancake  laughing and i couldnt  muffled how is this going to work  the only upside is  the original name was gonna be ass baby  and i kind of talked my way out of that one  all of the guys in this building are so sweet   its no problem yeah  couldnt be easier really  just a p piece of cake  coach we love it  you know it was my idea to help move  the only reason were doing this is because you forced us to  if we dont help now well look bad  yeah now theyre gonna think of us  as nice and helpful nightmare  hey  hey  coach oh cool  uh your brother  actually its my boyfriend  yet hes not here to help you move   hes out of the country  oh  afghanistan second tour   ah  oh  please thank him for   uh for his service  yeah  are you and your boyfriend  and michelle and her boyfriend gonna go on a like  double date kind of thing  whenever he gets back from afghanistan  she doesnt have a boyfriend  shes not really the relationship type   oh  okay  im just having fun right now  i feel you no i feel you laughs  girl i want to feel you  and then there was one  may the best man win   i am also involved in this  winston get out of here  what is your problem  and then there were three guys  jess heres what im saying  reginald is way too shy to beg for an education  hes very sensitive and when hes out on the horse  all hes doing is staring at leaves  and writing poems about them  why do i have a horse you know how many  people are killed on a horse every year  hey youre not listening to what im saying  what im saying is  im not gonna take reginald out on the damn lake  when youre out on your space truck   were not living by the lake  exasperated sigh  why would i spend my hardearned  truck driver money on an earth house   you make up so much science fiction  science  but you know nothing about science   do you know what science is  okay science is more of a belief   than anything else  no do you know what science is   yes what you believe in  have you ever taken a science class  ive taught two at a community college  when did you teach science at a community college  i made that up i didnt think you were gonna factcheck me  my kids are not gonna  beg for an education okay  theyre gonna be forced to go to school  just like everybody else  and theyre gonna hate it  can i actually be very real with you for a second   yes  heres what i really believe  you can create a plan for your life  and then crazy things get thrown at you  and that by the way is the closest thing  that i have to a plan  so maybe its crazy to talk about being  an intergalactic truck driver  but what i think is crazier  is trying to plan  every single detail of our future  i think its crazy not to i just cant   live that way  i guess we just disagree  well we never agree on anything ever nick  why are we doing this right now jess were hungover  just because i want to know were going in the same direction   that were on the same page  yes we are  well we live on different planets  oh youre talking about the fake future  i just  i guess we want different things  clearly we do   clearly we do  all right  so what are you saying  should we just break up  both laughing  yeah right like were just   gonna break up  just break up  over what  you dont like lakes  i dont like space thats okay  this is not why people break up  i break up with thee sir  bad australian accent i break up  i dont do voices   i think im still drunk  laughs  lets just get to the party   build this toy and go  yeah  lets do it we are  an unstoppable toybuilding team  yes we are  yeah  all right well first hurdle  the instructions are written upsidedown  ah its a false alarm  okay hit me what do you got  okay take the thing   that looks like a meth lab  this thing  and put it in the thing  that looks like a pipe bomb   oh hey  hey  now were cooking with gas   were a good team  i agree  you know what jess and if you want to move  to portland in the future  then were gonna move to portland  you know well live by the lake  ill learn to fish  and me and reginald will start  a newsletter you know  lake father lake son  and you know what  if you want to be a longhaul trucker  i can deal with that for six months tops   yes  um this piece is a little sticky   but i think i can just jam it  ah   what did you just do jess  oh well i put  the swastika in the guillotine  how is this a childrens toy  why is it so brittle  what is that  im not sure what ive been doing  sighs hey michelle  hey  you guys are lifesavers  you have beautiful taste by the way  really is this early californian  you know this

blink at me  wait you think that was a sex blink  that wasnt a sex blink  that was definitely a sex blink dude  you would not know a sex blink if it blinked you in the sex   what  its over already man  you dont have a shot  cause the chicks you pull are gremlins  you did not just talk about my chicks  my chicks look great  just like me  im saying my chicks   literally look just like me  all of em  in varying color  but they look like me  that is super awkward  and i dont feel like you know what   youre saying right now  whoops  oh coach  oh man i cant believe  you just did that to her vase  whoa dude  i will knock you out where you stand  and you in the ground  i will pound you from the side  i will pound you from the back that sounded weird  once again schmidt has found himself  in a position where he is infuriated  i will fight your face  i will freak out so hard  on you right now you dont even know on your face  winston what are you two  oh my goodness guys  her studyabroad mirror  her dream vase  come on guys  huffs  have some selfrespect  were  nick hey jess  i dont think that belongs there  thats why it doesnt fit in  well i dont think this water bottle goes here either  but you put it there  well why did we take the toy out of the box  we could have just given the box to the kid  what does he know hes one  he eats pennies and he poos in his pants  because not putting the toy together is lazy   so if we cant put the toy together  ii know but its not gonna fit  you cant just keep pushing it because it  oh god   okay wheres the tape  oh we used all the tape   oh you used all the tape  yeah to fix the things that you broke   you used a lot of duct tape  actually you broke a lot of pieces  laughs  all right give it to me im gonna use a lighter  and im gonna melt the plastic im gonna weld it together  what you dont think thats a good idea  no you should i think you should try it  i also like doing zippo tricks   ow aah i burned my finger  what happened are you okay  yeah its fine my skins a little bubbly  well i knew that was a bad idea  then why didnt you say anything  why didnt you put the toy together  when i gave it to you two weeks ago  because im not santa claus  i dont just put toys together  two weeks in advance and also  its none of my business what they want to do with the toy  maybe they want to return it  maybe they want to put it  together as a family  that is not my business  what do you want from me jess  i just want you to take a little more responsibility  just a little bit more  and i want you to have a little faith in me  ive gotten this far in my life  and im doing just fine  i mean for the most part  theres definitely a few blunders here and there  that we could look past  whatever  the blankets on fire  i can see that jess go get a bucket  where is it in the kitchen  no thats for meat  we need a different bucket  oh right  the famous meat bucket  you said the meat bucket was a brilliant idea  why would i think
