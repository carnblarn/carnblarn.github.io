aftertaste of toxic waste  all right all right so the machine produces a few toxic byproducts  you dont have to make a federal case of it  im afraid i do  i order you to dispose of that toxic waste or

herself  ill never forget the night that cute alien baby was abandoned on our doorstep      because i have a photographic memory and i remember every night      vogel what the  an alien language i guess youre an alien  what a beautiful gigantic eye you have  well come on in  from those humble beginnings      leela went on to become a countycertified starship captain  and so it is my pleasure today      to nail her picture alongside those of our most distinguished alumni  thank you very much  like many of you i never knew my parents  i dont know if they were mighty alien overlords      or simply underpaid alien janitors who fought crime on the side  pictures up its crooked  in the end though it doesnt matter who my parents were  all that matters is what i learned here within these unscalable walls      that i had the strength to make it on my own  just like all of you kids here today    leela leela leela  look at me im leela  no because im double leela whee  thats it albert no more espresso for you  mind if we get a picture of you with your picture  yes i mean no  just make sure you get my nonchalant side  whoo    if those arent tears of happiness please stop crying  its okay fry im fine  i won an award today  is it this room thats making you sad its probably the room  come on lets go for a walk  leela im sorry you saw that fry  i usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside      where it can fester quietly as a mental illness  yeah i do that with my stupidness  i told a whole crowd today that being an orphan made me strong  but all i really wanted was a mom and dad      to hold me and stroke my hair and tell me they love me  then todays your lucky day      because i happen to be a holding stroking loving machine  also spanking  thats not even close to what i had in mind  well anyway just remember that people care about you  i know  sometimes when im lonely      i look up at the sky and i get this feeling that somewhere      on some unknown planet circling a distant star      my parents are up there looking down on me    yo yo bazender what up  my dumping business is booming  i just got hired to clean up the set of free willy 3    bender cut it out  first of all the sewer mutants will be mad  second everything else thats horribly wrong with what youre doing  those stupid mutants cant do anything  you seem to be forgetting one simple fact  namely im up here and they are safely down      what did i do to deserve this  behold our once beautiful mutagenic sewage lake  the radioactive waste you dumped in it      has made it bright enough to see how ugly we really are  oh man  as if our lives werent miserable enough already  tell me about it let the punishment commence  punishment no fair  benders innocent  the instant you touch these mutateous waters      your dna will be forever altered      turning you into horrible mutants like us  especially him oh  allow me to demonstrate      its like that time i peeked in the kitchen at lmperial hunan  submerge the prisoners    wait i dont even have dna why am i screaming  were gonna beat you afterwards    all mutate mutate mutate  mom turanga leela  who said that how do you know my

when i dropped out and bummed around lndia for a while  and this is just last year at space mardi gras  its like some kind of weird leela museum  and im the leela fry dude over here  its all the best stuff i ever flushed down the toilet  those are some of my diary pages  and my screenplay  and also for some reason the letter i wrote you full of my personal feelings  oh im scared  my whole life has just been a show for some perverted mutant  mutant 1  ln here mutant 2 capture them  and then bender ran  leela freak out later were not done escaping yet    got you take this  ow  this time im calling for the death penalty  not just because im running for reelection as supreme mutant  mutants four more years four more years    very well  your attention lnstead of being tortured to death      the prisoners shall hereby be expelled from the sewers      and never allowed to return  oh cruel fate  can we really never return to this dank pit of sewage  wait a minute why arent you gonna kill us anymore  yeah what are you chicken  shut up you two we can kill ourselves when we get home  theyll need transportation to the surface  bring in the airship  ew  we constructed it from the remnants of old discarded macys parade balloons  underdogs groin bart simpsons left ear and right shin      garfields owner johns forehead  fire up the sewer gas    move it you ugly normals  whoa    im getting dizzy i cant walk straight      come on leela you can do it  bender hurry were missing our bus  fry hey what are you doing  bender im getting on the bus  dont worry ill be fine  they know something about me and ive got to find out what  the lake didnt mutate me what is going on here  it worked for me i used to be a little blond girl named virginia  ew    who the hell are you  no one and watch your language young lady  stop right there i dont wanna hurt you  i didnt want you to hurt me either  leelas nuts i cant save her unless i learn more about her past  isnt there anything else you can tell me  nothing that wouldnt be a waste of your time  thats impossible because my time is worthless  well then there is one thing  its the note i found with leela the day she was abandoned  but its written in alienese so no one on earth can translate it  not even brainzilla  hand it over sure  i just wish i could be more helpful  would you like some dirt on any other orphans  im trying to save someone here ill have to come back for those later  can you translate it of course  but only into betacryptthree      a language so complex theres even less chance of understanding it  i didnt ask for a completely reasonable excuse i asked you to get busy  very well  doesnt that machine make noses it can do other things why shouldnt it  of course even if it is possible to analyze the message      theres no way of knowing how long it will take  it could take an hour or it could take 1 00 million years    is it done certainly not  two dings means its done    but not like that slightly more rapid      where did they go  good news leela i landed the contract to empty all the spittoons in little ltaly    leela ew      thats it its done  i cant believe it my mind is boggling  the analysis of the note is printing out now  nurse its a girl my god shes beautiful  no extra anythings    what people skills  shes completely perfect  in my professional opinion as an ear ear ear nose and throat doctor      she is the least mutated mutant ever born  and yet shes cursed to live the horrible degrading life of a mutant      iike all of us especially him  its true  maybe we can do better for her  i made this bracelet so that in some small way well always be with you      even when it doesnt seem like it  during your entire life for example  you wont pass for human cutie  but if my phd in exolinguistics is worth diddlypoop      this note should convince them youre an alien  and thatll be enough to give you a real life  dad shell never know were her parents  thats our gift to her  better we should die than have her learn the shameful truth of her origin  im with you  vogel i guess youre an alien  what a beautiful gigantic eye you have  well come on in      mom keep quiet so she doesnt hear us  dad whats to talk about shh  leela hands up  tentacles too mom dont say anything stupid morris  what is all this  am i a game to you  or some kind of even more boring truman show  do you believe im your messiah the mutant dalai lama  stop me if i guess it  dad well actually mom morris  and what about this  whered you get this bracelet  did you steal it from me when i was a baby or from my parents  you robbed my parents didnt you  i bet you sick mutants killed them  my parents were confused aliens lost on earth and you killed them  is that it admit it  yes we killed them  you guessed the truth    because of you ill never know my parents  ill kill you  that would be best  fry stop  thanks bender dont do it leela  they killed my parents close  they are my parents yes  i had the professor analyze the alienese letter that was found with you  what does it say i dont know  but the analysis showed it was printed on recycled toilet paper  a squeezably soft paper used mainly in the sewers  it says your parents love you very much   we still do  so im not an alien im a mutant  we never wanted you to know  you deserved a better life  you must despise us  youre my parents  all ive ever wanted is to know you  this is the happiest moment of my life    ah
