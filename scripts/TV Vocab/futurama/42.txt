is a song called my broken friend  people say my broken friend is useless but i say his mind is free  theres lots of things my mangled robot friend could be  kick it   he could make a good hatrack  he only has to stand there   or a cheap doorstop  he doesn t need to move  or a great big giant thermos with a twistoff top   that would be good for soup  he could be a storage closet   for outdated pants  i like them tight  my broken friend could do it all  just give him a chance  that robot has a tragic secret that id like to share  my broken friend is closer to me than an ass to a chair   that robots name i never told you  whos that   you could not foresee  give it up  ill say it loud and sing it proud his name is you and me   don t melt me into a crowbar  it suffers alone  just cause i can
