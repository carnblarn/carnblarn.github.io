airport they had a place to buy nuts  no ancient atlanta was more than just a delta hub  it was a vibrant metropolis the equal of paris or new york  thats right honey whatever you say  loot at these fabulous ruins  turner field      the cocacola bottling plant      the airport  how could a city with such a fabulous airport end up underwater  thats a story only to be told in the chamber of commerce video      narrated by folkrock troubadour donovan  atlanta was a city landlocked  hundreds of miles from the area we now call the atlantic ocean  yet so desperate the citys desire for tourism   that they moved offshore became an island and bigger delta hub  until the city overdeveloped and it started to sink  knowing their fate the quality people ran away  ted turner hank aaron jeff foxworthy   the guy who invented cocacola   the magician and the other socalled gods of our legends  though gods they were  also jane fonda was there  the others remained behind  on their porches with rifles  and one day evolve into mermaids  and sing and dance and ring in the new  hail atlanta  the magician  wouldnt it take millions of years to evolve into mermaids  normally yes but the caffeine really sped things up  that stuffs wonderful  when umbriel brought home this carpetbagger i was against it  but damn if old legs here aint grown on me  shucks colonel  its very nice here but
