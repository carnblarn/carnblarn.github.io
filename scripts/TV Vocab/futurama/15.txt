them bananas  therefore by process of elimination      the electron must taste like grapeade  sorry i overslept until 5 pm  that monkey kept me up all night with his constant thinking  thinking and thinking trying to make me look idiotic  dont be jealous  without his hat he might be no more intelligent than you  i hate that rodent hes my most important experiment  if you dont stop fighting ill have you both neutered  thatll show him  id like you to meet my parents leo and lnes  im so glad we could admit amy      in exchange for your generous contribution  how much more for phi beta kappa

chandelier ill take a picture  oh  the partys winding down  lets take a road trip to tijuana and get fatbot some action  its my first time im really nervous  robot house  you were cruel it may sound like an afterschool special      but we learned who the real animal was today  peer pressure  look out hes got a gun  leave me alone  whats going on i thought you dont like bananas  of course i do i try so hard to fit in      but seeing my parents act like that      made me realize im just a primitive beast  not everyone turns out like their parents  look at me my folks were honest hardworking people  besides youre not like other monkeys youve got the hat  so what i mean sure it looks cool and it makes me smart  but it doesnt make me happy  thats so sad i didnt even know monkeys could cry  they cant its all the hat  if youre so miserable maybe you should go back to the jungle  the jungle  i couldnt do that to the professor im his prize experiment  hes like a father  hes not your father that guy in the punch bowl was your father  look at him im so proud  fry thanks professor not you      oh i always feared he might run off like this  why why  why didnt i break his legs  oh poor guenter  so he just ran away in the middle of the exam  im afraid so  all he handed in was a paper smeared with feces he tied with fry  i told him to go back to the jungle  you what after i spent months slaving over a hot monkey brain  you tried to force guenter to be a human but hes an animal  he belongs in the wild or the circus on a tiny tricycle  now thats entertainment  but guenters better off being intelligent tell him leela  im staying out of this now heres my opinion  what we should do is     what well go to the jungle      and let guenter decide  what  you all know the rules the winning house becomes greek council head  should that house currently be on any type of multiple secret probation      itll be lifted  and ill be forced to serve as grand marshal of a parade honoring them  i say robot house  your watercrafts as illdesigned as you yourselves  good one chet  oh yeah watch this  well i never  fraternities on your marks  hey  the jungles on mars look like the jungles on earth  jungles on earth  i see some movement i think its him  stand back  oops dont worry  theyll be fine once the tranquilizer wears off  theres our man  professor offer guenter the hat fry offer him the banana  hell choose if he wants to be intelligent or a mindless animal  guenter take the hat no the banana the banana  the philosophical and metaphysical ramifications  banana banana  whats that sound    you sure this is a shortcut not as sure as i was an hour ago      and the winner is      robot house  thank god this log is sturdy  put on the hat youre the only one who can save us  stupid monkey  not there keep trying  eureka the hat goes on the head its all so obvious now  help us guenter  my goodness hang on i need to do some calculations  got it  grab on  were saved appreciate it guenter  oh no hurry guenter climb up the vine you can still save yourself  why bother ive got nothing to live for  i was miserable as a genius  as a monkey i was so dumb i tried to wear a hat on my butt  theres just no place for me in this world  although on the other hand       oh that poor sweet monkey  lets go gather him up no sense letting him go to waste  guenter youre alive i guess the hat broke my fall  its working at half capacity but i can fix it  no wait i like it like this i actually feel sort of      happy  but what about your superintelligence  with that there was too much pressure  i want to be a moderately intelligent monkey who wears a suit  so im transferring to business school  no  come on everyone keg party in robot house    fry dropped out successfully and  returned to his deadend delivery job  guenter got his mba and became president of the fox network  fatbot caught a computer virus in tijuana and had to be rebooted  leela went on one date with dean vernon but he never called again  his job done bender stole everything of value  from robot house and ran off
