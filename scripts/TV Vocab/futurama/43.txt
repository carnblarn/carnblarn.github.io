                time keeps on slipping  go get it boy  how about a romantic ride in one of those swan boats  theyre dangerous but ive mastered them  those arent swan boats theyre swans  that explains these boat eggs  pitiful ballplayers of earth  i am ethan bubblegum tate commander of the harlem globetrotters  for generations your planet has lived in peace with our home world  but now for no reason  we challenge you to defend your honor on the basketball court  will no one meet our challenge have none of you earthlings game   what happens if we lose  nothing theres nothing at stake  beyond the shame of defeat  this will not stand  ill take you on you airballing bozos  you old man sweet clyde laugh derisively at him  i may be an old man in fact im fairly sure i am  but ill put you globetrotters in your place  with my team of mutant atomic supermen  behold my mutant atomic supermen   theyre only a foot high  theyre still young  mere atomic superboys really  well speed up their growth with time particles called cronotons   those destroyed an entire civili  good news everyone  youre off to the tempest nebula to gather cronotons  hey leela look at me  your face can take a lot of punishment good to know  theres a lot about my face you dont know you and it should get acquainted   cool your jets hotshot  why wont you go out with me   we both know theres something there  no i mean cool your jets  theyre melting benders face   here you go hot off the nebula  none too soon  the trotters held a news conference to announce that i was a jive sucker  behold my invincible nuclear mutants   hi  hello  marv albert here at madison cube garden  where the globetrotters take on a squad of atomic supermen  in what should be a bythenumbers contest with no surprises whatsoever  heres the tipoff globetrotter ball  clyde dixon to bubblegum tate drives downcourt  and curly joe from the rear   that one grabbed his behindus  quiet  who dares laugh at the jesters of dunk  we came to terrify and humiliate you not tickle your funny bones  watch as i embarrass your civilization by passing the ball to curly joe  only to have it remain in my hands with elastic  boo  and perhaps this will wipe the smiles from your faces  goose goes up  rejected agrowtreant from half court yes  globetrotters  42 supermen  45  supermen lead 4542  aracneon with the steal thorais from downtown  yes hes showing us what a man with a cannon in his chest can do  no showboating you atomic hotdog  and thats the half with the supermen up 4842 surprisingly dull so far  the trotters are down by six reactions  we planned to trail at the half thus deepening earths eventual humiliation  also what game were the refs watching  curly joe easily amused by his own antics continues to wreak havoc on   what the  what happened  what was that  did everything just jump around or did my brain just stroke off there  something very strange has just happened  in this game between space clowns and atomic monsters  timeout timeout   whats happening  were lurching forward in time  like a needle skipping on a record   whats causing it is it my outfit  no  it must have something to do with those time particles i used  time and space are ripping apart at the seams   oops  oh great  now on top of everything we need a new fifth man  put me in i wanna show leela my skills   will said skills pay the bills  who cares  were 35 points ahead with two minutes left what could possibly  globetrotters win 24486 a dark day for humanity folks  we have been beaten in basketball   yeah thats how we do it  hows that  you are all fools of the highest caliber  i dont know what you did fry but you screwed up  now all the planets are gonna crack wise about our mamas   im glad my fat mama isnt alive  enough about your promiscuous mom  we have bigger problems this time disruption is serious  damn right man  this chronological wangdangdoodle could destroy the matrix of reality   tate what do you know about this  not much yet  but i am senior lecturer in physics at globetrotter u id like to help   youre that bubblegum tate  i sure aint his grandma look here  we got an excess of cronotons in the subatomic interstices  yes i see  something involving that many big words could destabilize time itself   is that a problem  indeed  at this rate by tuesday itll be thursday by wednesday itll be august  and by thursday it will be the end of existence as we know it  i have to ask you to clear out the circus needs to set up for tomorrows  time continues to skip forward randomly  details at 1 1 this is the news at 1 1  the unexplained turning to entertainment news   teen singer wendy might be the won three grammys last night   found dead in her bathtub  interesting  we behave normally during the time skips but we have no memory of it   you mean we just  my yes just like that   any luck bubblegum  not yet   hope you dont mind if i dribble  not if you grant me the same liberty  bubblegum im a huge fan of your work both on and off the court   can i be a globetrotter  shut up turkey  bubblegum look the background time radiation is fluctuating wildly  that suckers shaking like fine booty  im no physicist but i think i know how to stop the skipping well just  i dont know how this was supposed to work  i hope you find out whats wrong before we skip my birthd   happy birthday amy  hooray look at all these presents  i hope we all have as much fun tomorrow at my birth what  ive set up a timeproof shelter in the closet  youre the one i want to share it with  fry thats so sweet let me see  how will this protect us from time jumps  because when were together in here baby time will stand still   zoidberg can i talk to you about fry  leela i would be honored   does the worst wc fields imitation ive ever seen zoidberg  sorry you must have been boring me  the thing is fry is very sweet but hes so immature  i love his boyish charm but i hate his childishness  so hes not perfect you dont wanna end up old and lonely like zoidberg  you were saying  there it is the tempest nebula take a whiff through the smellascope   whats that funky jazz  the odor of pure time leaking  when we removed the cronotons it destabilized the nebula  causing time skips throughout the universe   let bubblegum tell it  pretend these balls are time particles  as the nebula bouncepasses them off us  they cause dents or time skips  you are so smart  what if we were to move this star cluster to these algebraic coordinates  their gravity may divert the cronotons to the empty side of the universe  but is it possible  moving stars requires a badass gravity pump  wed need all the money on earth to build  heres funding it better work we cant spend all of earths money every day   how long will it take to build  it wont be easy  a jimjam this complex might take months or even  there we are one gravity pump  powerful enough to move the stars themselves  now to begin the arduous task of attaching it to the ship  off you go apparently  easy leela just fingerroll that star to the cosmic basket  just a few more  hundred thousand miles  there  nothing but nebula  i think weve stopped the time skips   all right  hooray for leela  what better way to celebrate than by showing bubblegum  the globetrotter uniform i made  let me see  hello lawsuit  i want you to know i think the way you moved those stars was wonderful  i got you something  moderately priced nonvintage champagne how did you know  you deserve it nobody ever stops to tell you what a great captain you are  that is so true and sweet  youre smart beautiful and best of all youll go out with me  fry please try to understand  youre a man im a woman were too different  bubblegum might let me organize a bake sale for the globetrotter wives   can you teach me to make cupcakes  all right i want to lick the beaters  i got her champagne what does a guy have to do  eightysix the chump stuff  its time to win leelas heart with a showy threepoint romantic gesture  maybe this is the moment to show her my real surprise   fry what are you doing  time to boogie on down to the sauna  ive been studying how to pilot impressed  yeah actually youre doing okay  the reactor temperature is nominal the blinkers off  i learned to work the gravity pump too in case we need it   so are we dating now  is that what this is all about  please cut it out now  i know theres some perfect thing i can do to make you love me   when i figure out what it is  i dont wanna hurt you  but there is absolutely positively no way that you and i will ever   man and wife you may kiss the bride  he looks radiant  bubblegum we failed the time skips havent stopped  even in these formal shorts i feel like a failure  you tricked me into marrying you didnt you  of course not   howd you do it drugs hypnosis  no drugs are for losers  and hypnosis is for losers with big eyebrows  i dont know what i did to make you love me but were married now   weve got the rest of our lives  the divorce is final   what  lets divide up the china  ill take the nfc helmets and you can have the afc  fine break my heart again  dont be so hard on yourself you lost the woman of your dreams  but you still have zoidberg you all still have zoidberg  how did i get leela to love me ive got to figure it out   maybe youre just a fantastic lover  i dont know what im doing  maybe shed come back if i were a globetrotter   what do you say bubblegum  hell no  its hopeless i did something so great it won leelas heart  and ill never ever know what it was my life is empty  zoidberg  no wonder we failed diverting cronotons is mathematically impossible  i knew i should have checked your showboating algebra  i thought you knew that algebra was all razzmatazz  a globetrotter always saves the good algebra for the final minutes  vintage bubblegum  the time skips are worse isolated spots are jumping by years look  stupid senior citizens  why should we pay for their benefits i deserve free money  im stumped well have to call in the finest scientific minds in the univer  we could explode the whole nebula what do you think curly joe  an explosion big enough to destroy that mama would take out half the universe  you got to globetrotter that explosion up a little make it an implosion  by god sweet clyde is right  an implosion might form a black hole thatd stop cronotons from escaping  whoa slow that brain train down prof  wed need some kind of doomsday device  doomsday device now the balls in farnsworths court  i suppose i could part with one and still be feared  give me some skin prof im making you an honorary globetrotter  in fact everybody in this rooms an honorary globetrotter  im a globetrotter   did you say  too late hot plate  crap  we must leave now for we are needed elsewhere but we wish you godspeed  please please let me come with you i can make myself taller  you can talk trash you can handle the ball  but ask yourself are you funky enough to be a globetrotter   are you  yes   are you  i mean with time my funk level   are you  no  deal with it   careful with that doomsday device  what does it matter  ill never be a globetrotter  my life and by extension everyone elses is meaningless  roger  leela i dont know what i did to make you love me  i dont think i tricked you but maybe i did   and if i did im sorry  its okay fry   you know well always be friends  yeah  i dont guess anything i do will make you feel for me the way i feel for you  i guess not  the doomsday device is ready  maybe blasting this space into a storm of nothingness will cheer me up  okay let me just take the ship out to a safe distance  actually i think ill go and prep the detonator  fry why dont you take the helm  shes so great  i almost remember the thing i did to make her love me  but i never will  sorry buddy i too know what its like to have a dream ill never achieve  thats how i did it i moved the stars to write her a love note   detonation in three two one  no  did you see it   the explosion  no not the explosion  then what  nothing
