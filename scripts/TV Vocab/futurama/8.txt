inventors annual symposium  wow i love symposia the scientific event of the season  every member presents an invention the best one wins the academy prize  sounds boring oh my yes but not this year      because my latest invention is unbeatable  behold the death clock  jam your finger in the hole this readout      tells you how long you have to live  does it really work sometimes its off by seconds      what with free will and all cool how long do i have to live  dibs on his cd player  a big piece of garbage  farnsworth oh my yes  whos the nerd thats me at the first symposium  im the academys oldest living member  these youngsters look up to me well well well  look whos showing his wrinkled face  just leave me alone wernstrom youre over the hill farnsworth  leave science to the 1 20yearolds  you think you know everything  i invented things when you were barely turning senile  go home before you embarrass yourself old man  now excuse me im taking a nap before the ceremonies  whos that jerk  he was my most promising student  but then after one fateful pop quiz     aminus no one gives ogden wernstrom an aminus  im sorry but penmanship counts  i swear ill have my revenge if it takes me 1 00 years  and here it is slightly over  im essentially in the clear  ive been perusing your fortified wine list      and ive selected the 71 hobos delight      the 57 chateau partay and the 66 thunder chevitz  exquisite choices sir  and mix them all together in a big jug  welcome to this years symposium im your host ron popeil      inventor of mr microphone the sprayon toupee      and the technology to keep heads alive in jars  wait theres more weve got many inventors tonight      starting with that upandcoming young star ogden wernstrom  boo more wine  distinguished members of the academy i present the reverse scuba suit  observe  fetch  now sit  i said sit bad fish    dont worry its no competition for your death clock  what will you be presenting grandpa  itll put you young whippersnappers in your place  i hope its not as lame as last years death clock  last year thats right  oh my  did it put you youngsters in place hardly  we laughed until our teeth fell out come along cinnamon  i have to invent something new in the next 1 0 minutes  perhaps some sort of death clock  uh professor    very nice amazing  our last presentation comes from our oldest member hubert farnsworth  professor  just a second just a second  pencils down pruneface  here i am now hello there  we all know telescopes allow us to see distant objects      but what if we want to smell those objects well now we can  thanks to my new invention      the smelloscope  the odor travels past this coffee stain here around the olive pit      and into this cigar burn  and this appears to be a      doodle of myself as a cowboy    but the smelloscope is brilliant  think of the astronomical odors youll smell thanks to me    oh my    ive waited 1 00 years for this  i give your invention the worst grade imaginable  an aminusminus    now for the presentation of the award im practically giving this away to      dr wernstrom for his fish thingy    perhaps 1 49 is just too old to be a scientist  yep no professor dont give up  there were many times in my century when i never gave up  never  are you even listening to me oh i give up  by god youre right im going to build that smelloscope  farnsworth eureka  fry did you build it  no i remembered that i built one last year  go ahead try it  youll find that every heavenly body has its own scent  here ill point it at jupiter    smells like strawberries exactly  and now saturn  pine needles man this is great  as long as you dont make me smell uranus  i dont get it im sorry fry  astronomers renamed uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke once and for all  whats it called now urectum  here let me locate it for you  no i think ill just smell around over here      what is it  oh jeez oh man  remarkable a stench so foul its right off the funkometer  fry may have discovered the smelliest object in the known universe  oh name it after me  i think its moving  perhaps the computer can calculate its trajectory  my god its headed straight for us  with enough force to reduce this city to a stinky crater  we have less than 72 hours  well lets get looting    this thing will destroy the whole city  what the heck is it  just as i thought  the answer lies in this movie i found on the internet  narrator new york city the year 2000  the most wasteful society in history   was running out of places to bury its neverending output of garbage  the landfills were full new jersey was full  under cover of darkness the city put its garbage out to sea  on the worlds largest barge    the repulsive barge circled the oceans for 50 years  but no country would accept it not even that really filthy one  you know the one i mean  finally in 2052 the city used its mob connections to obtain a rocket  and launch the garbage into outer space  some experts claim the ball may return to earth  but their concerns were dismissed as depressing   you got that off the internet in my day it was only used to download porn  actually thats still true  now that the garbage is in space  perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions  with gusto  aw  thats it due to the shortsightedness of old new york      new new york will be destroyed by a ball of garbage  what the hell were you people thinking then  how could you throw your garbage out give me a break  what do you do with it we recycle  robots are made from old beer cans and this cans made from old robots  that sandwich is made of discarded sandwiches  nothing just gets thrown away the future is disgusting  typical 20thcentury attitude  youve no right to criticize my century  we invented the light bulb steamboat and cotton gin  those are from the 1 9th century they probably just copied us  please theres no time for this now this is an emergency  we must warn the mayor  garbage ball huh that sounds serious  very serious mayor poopenmeyer  i hope this isnt a fraud like global warming or secondhand smoke  send in my science adviser  wernstrom well well well  come to present your latest napkin  im here because a giant trash ball is heading straight for us  smell for yourself  hey holy jeez  that smell could be anything      a faulty stench coil cheese on the lens who knows  we just got this transmission from neptune  recorded voice giant garbage ball  passed close by  horrible stench    the transmission ends there sir    no i guess it keeps going    there we go my god  the senile old man is right  do you mean him or me him  next new new york in crisis morbo  thanks human female  puny earthlings were shocked to learn that garbage   will destroy their pathetic city  im glad we live here in los angeles morbo agrees    cant we shoot a missile at it the supercomputers simulation      shows that the ball is too gooey missiles would go through it  but suppose we sent a crew to plant an explosive on the fault line      between this mass of coffee grounds and this deposit of aol floppy disks  in theory it could work  but youll never find a crew willing to go on such a suicidal mission  oh crap  farnsworth you only have one chance to destroy the ball  after that itll be so close that blowing it up      would cause garbage to rain on the entire planet      killing billions boohoo  heres the bomb ive prepared  once activated you have  thats all now now  well discuss your objections when and if you return  odor at magnitude eight    magnitude 1 2  magnitude 31   were breaking up  turn on the antismell device    fry sporty  wow leela look at all this filth  fry its not filth  its a monument to 20thcentury achievements  look a real beanie baby  a mr spock collectors plate    some bart simpson dolls  bart doll eat my shorts okay  mmm shorts  this was garbage when it was new lets blow it up already  this junk isnt garbage i can dig anywhere      and find something great    all right lets get to work  lets see  if thats hypodermic ridge then the bomb goes right here  get ready weve got 25 minutes  fifteen minutes   five minutes sixh minutes  theres your problem the professor put the counter on upside down  that idiot it wasnt set for    were gonna die right right  its gonna blow  hey youll put somebodys eye out  okay keep your space pants on ill take care of this    were saved yeah but the balls unstoppable now  new new york is done for    all in all this is one day mittens the kitten won t soon forget  kittens give morbo gas  in lighter news the city of new new york is doomed  blame rests with human hubert farnsworth  and his tiny inferior brain  oh how could i have put that timer on upside down  i swear i followed the manual precisely  im a driedup husk of a scientist this is all my fault  no its my fault too  im sure i threw out more than my share of trash  and when my toilet broke i just went straight in the garbage can  leelas right the people of the  especially me enough you failed miserably  time to put a real scientist in charge  wernstrom the very same  wernstrom can you save my city yes but itll cost you  first i need tenure done  a research grant you got it  lab access and five grad students at least three chinese  done whats your plan  what plan im set for life  au revoir suckers  that rat do something i would but hes got tenure    its time to take action  stephanie cancel the maid have her come tomorrow  well im out of ideas anyone  wait  if we could build an object of the same size density and consistency      it might knock the ball away without smashing it to bits  where can we find a substance the same density and consistency  alas i dont know  what about garbage  good lord a second ball of garbage that just might work  you cant just find garbage in the streets  citys been garbagefree for 500 years  then its time to make some more make garbage  but how stand back and watch the master  this slurm can  now its garbage these papers  garbage this picture of your wife  pure garbage now you try it  by god i think the boys got something  come on the fate of the city is at stake  good  dont finish that throw it away drink that beer and drop the bottle  very nice  get that robot some more beer  trashing this rooms a start lets get frys message to the people  people of new new york take a lesson from the 20th century  stop this recycling and throw your garbage on the floor  go on chuck it anywhere like i did your city is counting on you  if my calculations are correct this ball will knock the other      directly into the sun  if mine are correct were all going to die horribly  places everyone prepare for launch  five four three two      three four five six     just fire the damn thing  fry oops          burning garbage it worked  and so on behalf of the entire city i thank you professor farnsworth  i present you with the academy prize which we confiscated      from wernstrom after we realized he was a jackass  in your face wernstrom  ill get you farnsworth even if it takes another 1 00 years  and fry we owe you a tremendous debt as well  without your garbagemaking skills      wed all be buried under  should we be celebrating  what if it returns to earth like the first one  who cares that would take centuries  exactly its none of our concern  thats the 20thcentury spirit
