of movie patrons  thus they travel  making everyone stupid in order to wipe out all thought  wipe out thought my god theyre flying televisions  and even we are powerless to stop them fearsome though we are  there is one being who can resist  a child of destiny whose bizarre brain waves make him immune to their attack  he is the hope of the universe  the fate of your world perhaps all worlds rests in his special mind  now when you say special  attention new new yorkers  stop acting so stupid  fleet holding at perimeter of moron zone formerly known as earth  why would fry be immune because he doesnt shower  they suppress intelligence by attacking delta brain waves  every animal and robot generates this wave as do certain trees  fry however does not  somehow he has cobbled random brain waves into a working mind   like a carpetremnant prom dress  like your prom dress  the brain spawn are commanded by a brain with a gooey center of pure hate  only fry with his superior yet inferior mind can approach it  tell him to disable it we will do the rest   you can count on me  no   on earth you will be too stupid  thats why we wrote it down for you  we also prepared a bag lunch and

defeated let what must be done be done  me feel a bit better in cognitive faculties  i did it  and its all thanks to the books at my local library  and so life returned to normal  or as normal as it gets on this dirtball inhabited by psychotic apes  the people of earth had no memory of what had transpired  except fry and no one believed him or cared what he had to say  i returned to my post evervigilant lest earth again come under attack  and when that day comes god help us god help us all  time for a diapie change  end transmission
