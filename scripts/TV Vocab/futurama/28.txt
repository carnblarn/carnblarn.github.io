farnsworth is old  but if you consider his age hes likely to die soon  hey ringo that was the joke  its showtime at the apollo all over again  where would a professor be without students who love and respect him  right there  but seriously of all the former crew members of his delivery ship  our next speaker is by far the most alive  captain musky      i wouldnt want to follow that guy  and now a man who needs no introduction  fry get up there  thank you  when i was first asked to make a film about my nephew the professor  i thought why should i then later leela made the film  but if i had made it there would be more topless women on motorcycles  roll film  leela narrates hubert j farnsworth was born april 9th 285 1    in new new yorks nerdiest slum  hells laboratory   a precocious child he learned to read while he was still in diapers    at age 8  soon he became a greasy teenager   dork alert  after 14 years of graduate school    he settled into the glamorous life of a scientist   fast cars trendy nightspots    beautiful women   the professor designed them all  working out of his oneroom apartment   for 50 years he worked at moms friendly robot company    where he created the first robot capable of qualifying for a boat loan   and now even as he nears his 150th birthday    the professor retains the fiery passion of youth   listen to me you pompous frauds   if im going down  im taking you all with me   how about a few words professor    i said words  what a pleasure it is to see my lifetime of accomplishment  summed up in a 3minute film  my best years are behind me  so much left undone  so little time  funny funny stuff  my life is over  no it isnt you have another 10 years left  leela he could live another 100 years  no he couldnt  when you turn 160  robots from the sunset squad take you to a mysterious planet  and you never return  wow a whole planet of old people where is it  nobody knows  so many loves halfioved  so many inventions halfinvented  that damn time machine alone set me back 15 years  if only itd work you could go back and not waste your time on it  theres no one to carry on after im gone  no one to take over my work and my research and my fabulous fortune  by god thats it  ive got to name a successor  all a successor  a successor to the professor  theres no time to lose  im off to my lab to build a successornaming machine  the professors been in his lab for days  i hope he didnt die unless he named me his successor  then i hope he did die  you the successor over my empty shell  the professor will pick me only i have his lobsterlike tenacity  up yours zoidberg  up wherever your species traditionally crams things  the only sensible way to pick a successor is with a limbo contest   what  kingston rules  two men go down one comes up  look the professor trusts me with a giant spaceship  he wouldnt trust you with his dentures  yes he would  sorry everyone but need i remind you blood is thicker than water  blood thicker water  everyone i have a very dramatic announcement  so anyone with a weak heart should leave now  goodbye  professor  oh yes the announcement  as you all know i am not long for this world   yes we know  one foot in the grave  so ive picked my successor  its someone in whom i have great faith  though his mind is undeveloped and hes accomplished nothing  my closest living relative  my clone qbert farnsworth  hes horrible  crud can i at least be in charge of your dentures  you wish  where did he come from  i began the cloning process  by removing skin cells from one of the shapelier growths on my back  if hes your clone why doesnt his nose look like yours  i left him in his first tube too long and he got squished against the side  is he dumb or just ugly  lets find out  what youve never seen a geniuss wiener before  all no never fry once in the park    shoot  since im going to be in charge  let me examine my socalled crew  if it can so be called  first of all dr zoidberg  do you even have a medical degree  i lost it  in a volcano  and why do we need a bending robot around here anyway  what possible use do we have for you  me no speaka the english  and why does our space pilot have only one eye  theres someone id like you to meet his name is depth perception  why you little  wow that hurt the air  him pending para un bending  qbert come in here  ill show you something amazing  what is it a competent employee  i doubt that very much   the little twerp  hay chihuahua  as my successor im trusting you to carry on my work  these are some of the inventions youll spend your life finishing  i didnt realize you were the inventor of the junk heap  thats my prizewinning smellascope  if a dog craps anywhere in the universe i wont be out of the loop  and this is my universal translator  unfortunately so far  it only translates into an incomprehensible dead language   hello bonjour   crazy gibberish   dont you have worthwhile inventions  why certainly step over here  farnsworth these are the darkmatter engines i invented   they allow my starship to travel between galaxies in mere hours  thats impossible you cant go faster than the speed of light  of course not thats why scientists increased the speed of light in 2208  also impossible  and what makes my engines truly remarkable is the afterburner  which delivers 200percent fuel efficiency  thats especially impossible  not at all its very simple  then explain it  now thats impossible  it came to me in a dream and i forgot it in another dream  your explanations are pure weaponsgrade bolognium  its all impossible  nothings impossible if you can imagine it  thats what being a scientist is all about  no thats what being a magical elf is all about  oh my god  bender its elzar the tv chef  kill me now people   how we doing here  elzar everythings so good  are you an asskissing machine  yes sir good one sir  its a gem of an evening  i feel so wonderful having someone to take over my lifes work  and its all thanks to qbert  look i may be identical to you in every possible way  but that doesnt mean im like you   what  i dont want to be an inventor  i want to be something useful like a teachers aide  or a prison guard or a sciencefiction cartoon writer  but what about my hopes and my dreams  and my wonderful inventions  in your life your only halfdecent invention was me  and i didnt turn out like you wanted either   you folks still doing all right  oh yes elzar  turns out i forgot to cook that chicken  bad news everyone  by the time you watch this tape  ill be gone    leaving

especially bender   well life goes on  except for you  im sure hes just made a cutting remark    but he doesn t know i taped over his soap operas to record this   you bastard  weve got to get him back

guest  this is professor hubert farnsworth he escaped  escaped no one escapes  this guest does not look 160  what im old listen  hey you kids get off the lawn  old people are often concerned that there are children on their lawns  no denying that but well need to verify his identity with a dna sample  got a hot steaming batch right here  we only needed one cell  keep the change buddy  qbert stupid robot   did your hump just say something  ive got talking hump syndrome   ah ths  identity confirmed return this shambling shuffleboarder to his room    sounds nice  prepare to be surprised  so this is where they stick old people its horrific  it does keep them from driving  brace yourself for the worst   and yet he looks so natural qbert whats happening  hes hooked up to life support we have to disconnect him carefully  or the shock could kill him  freeze  seize them  get them i mean seize them  oh im so bad at this  uh oh    well probably make it but we might not   its impossible well never fit  will too  told you  come on leela step your big boot down on the gas pedal   theyve blown out one of our engines  fix it fix it fix it  fix it fix it  only the professor knows how we have to wake him up  try shocking him  your social security check is late  stuff costs more than it used to  young people use curse words  damn well have to fix it ourselves  we cant you bastard  no one knows how it works its impossible  nothing is impossible i know how the engines work now  it came to me in a dream  the engines dont move the ship at all  the ship stays where it is and the engines move the universe around it  thats a complete load  nothings a complete load not if you can imagine it  thats what being a scientist is about right professor    lets ride  qbert good news everyone   hes completely recovered   all right  yeah  im as spry as a 140yearold  see i only broke one ankle  what happened to you in the drawer  i was hooked up to a bizarre virtual world that seemed absolutely real   what was it like  i was at a facility in florida  with hundreds of other old people  all day wed play bingo eat oatmeal and wait for our children to call  its more horrible than anything i could imagine  oh my yes thank you all for saving me  especially you my little clone  no matter what you decide to do with your life im still proud of you  ive already decided  dad
