second theyve all done that  even sean  this love intrigues me teach me to fake it  youre on a date what do you do   ask her to mate  say shes special  shes not she just has the largest clutch of eggs   well tell her that then  then mating  no make up feelings and tell her you have them   is desire to mate a feeling  youre not even trying  its all so complicated the romance and the lies upon lies  dont worry the love meister will take you under his wing  now theres a bird involved  okay go ahead  what the dr zoidberg  your display failed why are you trying to talk to me  i dont know  you just want to talk  i just want to talk  that doesnt make sense  that doesnt make sense but okay  tell her she looks thin  you seem malnourished do you suffer from parasites  yes thanks for noticing   ask about her day  why would i care   you wouldnt ask  how was your day  well first i got up and had a piece of toast  then i went to the store and  look she wont shut up  its normal just nod and say uhhuh    uhhuh uhhuh  and then you threw an octopus  its crazy but when you talk this way  your obvious deficiencies seem less obvious  your genes seem less detrimental you even stink more   ask to mate  third date  so i returned his artificial heart  since then ive been called honest bender   id like to propose a toast to coat check number 84    turn it over  oh edna  of all the gross crab
