some cash  no thanks id rather make out with my monroebot  do you want to come over we can make out together  your house is across the street  thats an awfully long way to go for making out  what went wrong in that scene  ordinarily billy would work hard to make money with his paper route  then use the money to buy dinner for mavis  thus earning a slim chance to perform the reproductive act  but if teens can date robots why should he bother  why should anyone bother lets look at billys planet a year later  where are all the football stars and where are the biochemists  theyre trapped trapped in the soft viselike grip of robot lips  all civilization was an effort to impress the opposite sex  and sometimes the same sex  now lets skip forward 80 years into the future wheres billy  farewell  the
