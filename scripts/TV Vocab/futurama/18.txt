but the empathy chip burned out  the emotion you felt for nibbler was your own  so bender learned a lesson  about respecting other peoples feelings after all  no im wrong the chip was running at triple capacity  and i still barely felt anything good night losers  maybe bender didnt learn from me  but i learned something from him  so long jerkwads  so long
