us  incoming torpedoes shields at maximum yarnell  steady planet express ship  focus on diverting all power to the scram jets  look planet express ship this might not be the best time      but well i really like you and whatever      but i think we should just be friends  ship no  so were cool    well it was a spectacular battle  but there doesnt seem to be any permanent damage  no damage what about my feelings  aw calm down im sure bender is taking this just as hard as you are  bender is great oh bender is great  you couldve picked a better time to dump the ship  the moment seemed right  call me oldfashioned but i like a dump to be as memorable as it is devastating    i know i know look ship  if i learned one thing from my breakup with shawn that was totally mutual      its that happiness can only come from within you  but bender is within me  there must be some way to make him love me again  trust me you cant change men      any more than you can change the laws of time and space  that is so true    i may not be able to change the laws of time and space      but i know something that can    sweetie you see that giant quasar were heading into  you might want to scooch a few parsecs to the left  im afraid i cant do that leela  whats happening space cow  the ships just taking the breakup a little hard shes nuts  in a few moments the power of 1 0 billion black holes      will smoosh bender and me together      into a beautiful eternal quantum singularity    you dont need to kill us planet express ship  because i love you yeah baby  feel like doing stuff for you and stuff  hm i dont believe you  if you really wanted to be with me      youd merge your programming with mine  whoa whoa whoa slow down my friends whove done that      say that afterwards all the passion went out of their relationship  i dont know if you want my opinion leela  bender and i really need to be alone so im turning off the oxygen    look missy if you dont turn around now      im gonna have to shut down your brain  fire detected in the vicinity of leela  that barely hurt leela at all maybe not  but what if the artificial gravity were to malfunction  bender float for your lives  this is the one place she cant hear us just pretend to shower  same as every day got it now heres the plan  oh if only i could read lips  comprende bender youll have to distract her  merge your programming with hers while i shut down her brain  its too risky im a very meek individual  if her personality engulfs mine the bender you know and worship      could disappear forever  im willing to take that risk  hey pookums contrary to what i was saying earlier      melding minds with you would be extremely bearable  you really mean it  uh yes      huh hey  tubes youre older than you said you were  come closer bender lets become one  i prefer two that way we can still be a horse for halloween    okay bender has her distracted now i can shut down her brain      by deactivating the carbonated logic matrix  oh i cant concentrate with this obnoxious candy in my face  im on it maybe ill find those magic words while im at it  leela fat chance yeah i know    oh how about this one give it up fry  ive got to pop these tops in a precise order  halfway there the ship should be getting a bit less rational now  me want engulf bender bender no i didnt do it  only a few more  hey i won free admission to six flags  just one more reason we must survive this  leela fry ill read your candy later  when were not dead    what was that oh nothing  were gonna love being each other you sexy ion    last one      it worked gravity normal air returning terror replaced by cautious optimism  we did it fry fry    you gave me your oxygen oh no  breathe fry breathe    oh     you leave me breathless  happy valentines day fry happy valentines day  bender are you okay  what crazy thing am i gonna date next  it sounds like you were able to keep your consciousness separate from hers  of course bender is a lone wolf a solitary eagle  female voice a cuddly baby tapir  benders voice and thats why i love him  i guess wed better clean up these millions of hearts  no ive got a lazier idea  zoidberg as the candy hearts poured into the fiery quasar  a wondrous thing happened why not  they vaporized into a mystical love radiation   that spread across the universe destroying many many planets  including two gangster planets and a cowboy world  but one planet was exactly the right distance to see the romantic rays  but not be destroyed by them earth  so all over the world couples stood together in joy  and me zoidberg  no one could have been happier unless it would have also been valentines day  what it was hooray
