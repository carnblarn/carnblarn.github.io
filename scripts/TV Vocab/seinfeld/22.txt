 yeah i know what youre thinking  whys this guy making such a stink about old library books  well let me give you a hint junior  maybe we can live without libraries people like you and me maybe  sure were too old to change the world  but what about that kid sitting down opening a book right now  in a branch at the local library  and finding drawings of peepees and weewees  in the cat in the hat and the five chinese brothers  doesnt he deserve better  look if you think this is about overdue fines and missing books  you better think again this is about that kids right  to read a book without getting his mind warped  or maybe that turns you on seinfeld  maybe thats how you get your kicks you and your goodtime buddies  well i got a flash for you joyboy  party time is over  you got seven

chewing dentyne  i always chewed dentyne  remember jerry dentyne  no black jack licorice gum never  what else  we were  reading passages to each other from that henry miller book you had  tropic of

when its closed  oh yeah you dont have to be quiet  listen to the echo  hello hello  hello hello  hello hello  mr bookman  i remember when the librarian was a much older woman  kindly discreet unattractive  we didnt know anything about her private life  we didnt wanna know about her private life  she didnt have a private life  when you think about that think about this  the library closes

doesnt move  so i said  cant stand you cant stand you  he turns and smiles  the little bakedbean teeth  i get up to run away  but something was holding me back  it was heyman  he had my underwear  here i was on the steps of the 42nd street library  a grown man  getting a wedgie  at least it wasnt atomic  it was  so georgie boy guess what happened to tropic of cancer  how should i know because i
