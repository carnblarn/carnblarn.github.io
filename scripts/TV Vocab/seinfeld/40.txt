cut through the shoe cut through the can yeah  yeah i want that  so i called up the number on the screen you know  and i said  id like to order the ginsu knife  and the lady went really  i mean even the ginsu people have given up  its really so sad you know  i guess to be honest if you need a knife that can cut through a shoe  perhaps youre not buying the highest grade of meat available  maybe you ought to think about not getting the hoof cut once in a while  what is it about sleep that mak es you so thirsty  do dreams require liquid  its not lik e im running a marathon im just lying there

you want to know what happened to kramer ill tell you  he was ticked off about the keys  yeah thats right about the keys   thought he got a bad rap  bad rap   yeah from you  me  you heard me so he packed a grip and he split for the coast  lala land la  la  i never should have taken his keys away  he drove me to it i had no choice  he wouldnt take them back  elaine you saw it remember  i said take the keys back he wouldnt do anything  you saw it didnt you see it  yeah yeah i saw it  i mean it was complete bull but i saw   what  no whatd you say  nothing i didnt say anything  oh you didnt see it  yeah i saw it i saw it   i saw it yep  i heard you say something there   i didnt say anything  im calling kramers mother  i dont know what you said but it was something  i heard something  hello hello mrs kramer  mrs kramer  could you turn the music down  could you turn the music down   ask her about kramer  shes drunk out of her mind  oh my keys  this is perfect  elaine are you there  its me im locked out i need my spare keys where are you  im at the coffee shop  hey you ever been in an accident  about five years ago  i was going down this very road  same time of day going about the same speed im going now  there was a rock in the road  it couldnt have been more than a pebble  never really saw it  lost control of the bike went flying about a hundred feet  came down right on my head  cracked it wide open  blood and stuff just splattered all over the road there  broke every bone in my face  you know when they found me  my eyes were hanging out of their sockets  yeah they pronounced me dead at the scene  was in a coma for well they told me about a year  said id be a vegetable for life  yeah but i showed them  of course since then i always wear a helmet  lean  lean  georgie boy  way to come through with the keys   sit down im buying you dinner  look  i just dont feel right about letting you into elaines apartment  dont feel right what are you talking about  i let you into kramers now you wanna go into elaines  she entrusted me with her keys how can i just let you in  what is the big deal  just because you have someones spare keys  doesnt entitle you to break in  thats the reason you took kramers keys  youre not even supposed to have elaines keys  youre supposed to give them to her so she can give them to me  so technically those are my keys  if youd never taken your keys from kramer  he never would have given his to me  in which case i wouldnt have had to take mine back from her   i want those keys  no can do   george i want these  stop it let go   george i dont want to get physical  you wanna fight   wanna fight  ill fight you   lets go  nothing in the face   okay  all right  and then the evil ogre took back the magical keys  from the handsome young prince  oh no he didnt take back the keys   no way  yes  and then the handsome young prince  was cast out into the cruel cruel world  oh man what a bummer   that ogre dude is pretty cold huh  hes cold  let me tell you something kramer  if that ogre dude pulled that crap on me  ld stab him  wait  id cut him in half  id gut him like a fish man   thats what id do  yeah yeah thatd be funny  hey you can drop me here  hey whats the rush man   well i got to be going now  hey kramer  have you ever killed a man  what do you think  you think these hands have been soaking in lvory liquid huh  oh dont leave kramer stay with us  oh you know so much about the world we need you   please kramer  please kramer  well now star cloud   okay wait a minute  please kramer   no no no  please kramer  see youre avoiding the middleman  youd give her her keys which she would give to me  so instead of giving them to her you give them to me  unfortunately when she gave you yours you didnt give her hers  shed give them to me because she has mine  then i wouldnt have to ask you for hers  so that i could get mine  youre right how did i miss that  maybe because its a crock of sh   whats that  nothing   i heard something  didnt say anything  so how long you been driving this thing  going on four years  well nothings sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi  nothing  well  listen to you youre quite the sweet talker  i always wanted to drive the big rigs  i used to watch those commercials during reruns of gomer pyle   you wanna give it a try  really   do you know how to doubleclutch  yeah

very good feeling about you  yes  so i fly a lot i was on a plane the other day and i was wondering  are there keys to the plane do they need keys to start the plane  maybe thats what those delays on the ground are sometimes at the gate  maybe the pilots up in the cockpit going  oh i dont believe this  oh my god  i did it again  they tell you its mechanical  they dont want to come on the pa system  ladies and gentlemen  were gonna be delayed here a little while i  oh god this is so embarrassing  i left the keys to the plane in my apartment  you see technicians you think theyre servicing it  but theyre looking for the magnet hideakey under the wing  maybe he left it up there somewhere
