 in fact if you get a doctors note its covered by insurance  physical therapy is covered by insurance  yeah  you dont pay for the massage not if you have a doctors note  so where do you get this note  ive never actually done it but if i wanted to  i could probably get one from roy the dentist  right your friend roy  whats the name of this physical therapist  ill tell you but dont ask her anything

comment  about some lunatic in pennsylvania and im cut off  this woman is insane  whats with you  what  you were too close to me i was all scrunched in there  hey you scrunched me  i sat down here first  hey  i saw dimaggio in the doughnut shop again  yeah joe dimaggio  joe dimaggio this time i went in and i sat down across from him  and i really watched him  i studied his every move  for example he dunks  joe dimaggio dunks his doughnuts thats right  see now i know its not him joe dimaggio could not be a dunker  oh hes a dunker  why couldnt he be a dunker nothing diverts his attention  like im sitting in there you know  and i start banging on the table so that hell look up  like im sitting there and l  he wouldnt move so then i started doing these yelping noises like  no reaction because the guy is so focused you see  he can just block out anything thats going on around him  see thats how he played baseball  he dunks like he hits  so then what well  then the waitress she comes up and she tells me to shut up  or theyre gonna throw me out  why didnt you just call out his name  what happened to you  these kids called me a mary  a what  i was jumping over a puddle  for some reason i went like this  and they called me a mary  so i chased them and i tripped and i fell  yeah you know kids they can be very perceptive  hey george what is this  what is that  no really what is

the police  the police  what is the  hi george  hello  raymond  well i mean its only a sixmonth probation  its a slap on the wrist  i still dont see any dinner invitations forthcoming  men have been popping into my sexual fantasies  all of a sudden ill be in the middle  of what  and a guy will appear from out of nowhere  i said get out of here  what do you want you dont belong here  what do they do they talk back  they go hey george hows it going  i said get the hell out of here  hey its the kman  maybe its time you got a different hobby  oh man  just came from roys  i threw up from the gas  did he say anything no no hes fine  oh my god its  what joe dimaggio  having a cup of coffee  and hes dunking yeah  look at him  the yankee clipper  here  you see now that is a handsome man  oh please  wait hold on a minute wait  see i told you  what causes homophobia  what is it that makes a heterosexual man worry  i think its because men know that deep down  we have weak sales resistance  were constantly buying shoes that hurt us pants that dont fit right  men think obviously i can be talked into anything  what if i accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store  thinking its a shoe store and the salesman goes  just hold this guys hand walk around the store see how you feel  no obligation no pressure just try it  would you like to see him in a sandal
