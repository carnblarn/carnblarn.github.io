                the bad thing about television  is that everybody you see on television is doing something better  than what youre doing  you never see anybody on tv sliding off the sofa  with crumbs on their face  some people have a little too much fun  the soda commercial people  where do they summon this enthusiasm  have you seen them we have soda we have soda we have soda  jumping laughing flying through the air  lts a can of soda  have you ever been standing there and youre watching tv  and youre drinking the exact product  that theyre advertising right there on tv  and its like you know theyre spiking volleyballs jetskiing girls in bikinis  and lm standing there  maybe lm putting too much ice in mine  so then as we were leaving  we were just kind of standing there and she was smiling at me  l wasnt sure if she wanted me to ask her out  when women smile l dont know what it means  sometimes l interpret it like theyre psychotic  l dont know if lm supposed to smile back  l just stood there remember quayle when  bentsen gave him the kennedy line thats what l looked like  so you didnt ask no l froze  counter oh yeah so wait wait  halfhour later lm back at the office l tell lloyd the story  he says why dont you call her l says  l cant l couldnt do it then  for me to ask a woman out l gotta get into a mental state  like karate guys before they break bricks  so then lloyd calls me a wuss  he said wuss yeah  anyway he shamed me into it  so you called right  and to cover my nervousness l started eating an apple  l think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone  makes you sound casual yeah like a farm boy  right so l call her up l tell her its me  she gives me an enthusiastic  hi  enthusiastic hi thats beautiful  l dont get the enthusiastic hi lm out of there  so youre chewing your apple you got your enthusiastic hi  were talking l dont go too long before l ask them out  l want to get it over with right away  so l just blurt out what are you doing saturday night  and  she bought  great day in the morning  then l got off the phone right away  lts like robbing a bank dont loiter in front of the teller with a bag of money  you make your hit and get out  we both have dates on the same night  l cant remember the last time that happened  l cant stand doing laundry thats why l have 40 pairs of underwear  you do not absolutely  because instead of doing a wash l just keep buying underwear  my goal is to have over 360 pair  that way l only have to do wash once a year  come on try it  let me hear you try a scottish accent  thats lrish lrish scottish  whats the difference lassie  so thanks for dinner lt was great  yeah  we should do this again  would you like to come upstairs for coffee  no thanks l cant drink coffee at night lt keeps me up  so  okay  okay  good night  yeah take it easy  thanks again for the movie youre welcome  ld invite you up but the place is being painted  oh thats okay  unless you want to go to your place  okay but theres no cake or anything if thats what youre looking for  take it easy  take it easy  l think if ones going to kill oneself  the least you could do is leave a note lts common courtesy  l dont know  thats just the way l was brought up  values are important so important  what are you doing thursday night you wanna have dinner  thursdays great  tan pants  why do l buy tan pants donna  l dont feel comfortable in them  are those cotton dockers  l cant begin to tell you how much l hate that commercial  really  l like that commercial  you like that commercial  yeah lts clever  you mean the one where the guys are all standing around  supposedly being very casual and witty  yeah thats the one  what could you possibly like about that  l dont know l like the guys  yeah theyre so funny and so comfortable with each other  and l could be comfortable too if l had pants like that  l could sit on a porch and wrestle around  and maybe even be part of a real bull session  l know guys like that to me the dialogue rings true  even if the dialogue did ring true  even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that  what does that have anything to do with the pants  doesnt that bother you  thats the idea that is what is clever about it  theyre not talking about pants theyre talking about nothing  thats the point l know the point  no one is telling you to like it  all those quick shots of the pants just pants pants pants pants  what is that supposed to be  whats brutal about the date is the scrutiny you put each other through  because whenever you think about this person  in terms of the future you have to magnify everything about them  the guy will be like  l dont think her eyebrows are even  could l look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life  of course the womans looking at the guy thinking  what is he looking at  do l want someone looking at me like this for the rest of my life  lm supposed to see her again on thursday  but can l go out with someone that actually likes this commercial  l once broke up with a guy because he didnt keep his bathroom clean  no kidding did you tell him that was the reason  yeah l told him all the time  you would not have believed his tub  germs were building a town in there  they were constructing offices  houses near the drain were going for 1 50000  hi  youre still thinking about this  she invites me up at 1 200 at night for coffee  and l dont go up   no thank you  l dont want coffee  lt keeps me up  too late for me to drink coffee  l said this to her  people this stupid shouldnt be allowed to

morning not at 1 200 at night  some people drink coffee that late  yeah people who work at norad who are on 24hour missile watch  everything was going along so great she was laughing  l was funny  l kept saying to myself  keep it up dont blow it youre doing great  lts all in your head all she knows is she had a good time  l think you should call her l cant call her now lts too soon  lm planning a wednesday call  why l love it when guys call me the next day  of course you do but youre imagining a guy you like  not a guy who goes  no l dont drink coffee late at night  lf l call her now shes
