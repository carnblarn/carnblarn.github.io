organic organic so is buddy hackett  buddy hackett hes a comedian  i know  all right all right hey you can go over here  i can manage  george  okay lets go but  come on  kramer  im telling you ive had this condition since i was 11 years old  ive been in and out of hospitals my whole life  i have no control over it  doctors have told me that when i feel it  the best thing to do is just release it  otherwise  i could die  do you hear what im saying to you  im telling you that if i dont go i could die  die is it worth dying for  thats up to you oh so you dont care if i die  what i care about is the sanitary condition of the parking facility  why would i do it unless i was in mortal danger  i know its against the law i dont know  because i could get uromysitisis poisoning and die thats why  you think i enjoy living like this  the shame the humiliation  you know ive been issued a public urination pass  by the city because of my condition  unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning  him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place  jerry  jerry  unbelievable  im never gonna get out of here  guy goes to pee he never comes back  its like a sciencefiction story  maybe he went to one of the other levels  im gonna look for him now youre gonna go  be back in five minutes lf you go now  well find the car jerry will show up and well never find you  ill be right back  whats the difference well all be dead eventually  does that bother you  yeah it bothers me  doesnt it bother you not at all  now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me  because people like you live to be 1 20  because youre not bothered by it  how can it not bother you  well i once saw this thing on tv with people who are terminally ill  every one of them believed that the secret of life  is just to live every moment  yeah ive heard that  meanwhile im here with you in a parking garage in jersey  thats a nice jacket whered you get that  some guy left it over at my mothers house  first of all you dont even know technically that i went  thats for starters  i mean i could have been pouring a bottle of water out there  i know what you did oh really do you well  it just so happens that i did pour water out  i had a bottle of very tepid water and i poured it out  i could see how you made a mistake  because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating  and you know when you think about it  its really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity  and thats all it is  and now hes gone im sure hes looking for the car  five minutes thats all i just wanna find him  i cant do it but why why cant you do it  i cant  thats not a reason you cant you just dont want to  thats right  but why why dont you want to  i dont know  well wouldnt you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out  no i wouldnt  all right all right  l i want to apologize  i was frightened  i said crazy things i obviously offended you  i insulted your intelligence  the uromysitisis the water bottle  i made all that up  and now im gonna tell you the truth  today my parents are celebrating  their 50th well im jumping ahead here  their 4 7th wedding anniversary  and we made plans to spend the evening together  theyre meeting me in front of my building at 61 5  what i havent told you  or anyone else for that matter  is that my fathers been in a red chinese prison  for the past 1 4 years  i mean the guy had a fat fetish  the inspector never dated a woman under 250 pounds  really what did he do with all that fat  does he just jump up and down on it  or does he gouge it like killer kowalski  whos killer kowalski he was a wrestler  he would get down on his knees  and hed grab ahold of someones stomach  and squeeze it till they gave  hey hey hey i have to go to the bathroom  why dont you just go  what here  you and jerry its  okay  all right im gonna go down this row  what what did i do i didnt do anything  kramer kramer  what dont you believe me

this move once they do this  when they look back from where they came from  no youre in bad shape now  nobody that knows where theyre going does that  pilots on planes dont open the cockpit door and go  well what happened was  my father was staying with one of chinas great military leaders  general chang who by the way came up with the recipe  for general changs chicken the one with red pepper

well that could be a problem  wheres your little bag of  all right lets giddyup  see the problem with the mall garage  is that everything looks the same  they try to differentiate it  they put up

fathers an abusive alcoholic  i know where i parked
