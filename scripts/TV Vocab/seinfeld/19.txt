formerly  a highly placed official with a little outfit  known as the irs  and as we speak at this very moment  he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information  and she has assured us  that the matter is well within her field of expertise  why is she doing this  i dont know it must be love  i dont think we should see each other anymore  youre great  but im riddled with personal problems  whats wrong what did i do nothing its not you  its me i have a fear of commitment  i dont know how to love you hate my earrings dont you  no no and you didnt comment  on the chopsticks  i

whats it for  i found it on the road  yeah i just finished working out  are you busy no come on up  can you believe somebody threw this out  im gonna make a coffee table out of this and surprise tina  well wouldnt it be invisible  i mean what are you gonna just sense its in front of the couch  well  hello  hello  whats with you two  you havent told him told me what  go ahead tell him  i saw her naked  he saw me naked  kramer saw me naked  well it was an accident  who walks into a womans bedroom without knocking i wanna know  i thought it was a closet  completely naked  completely naked  jerry how can i go on  all right if its gonna make you feel any better you can see me naked  no thank you  no i want you to see me naked no no no  i wanna show you no jerry  hold it just a second  lets not lose our heads here  kramer you know youre always welcome in my home  but as far as mr johnson is concerned  thats another story  what is this its a windshield  its going to be your new coffee table  im gonna kill myself on that thing you cant even see it  youll sense it  well what happened was she there  no no she wasnt  you didnt get my papers no i didnt  well where is she  a mental institution  why is it so difficult uncomfortable to be naked  its because we have clothes on  you can always make those little adjustments which people love to do  you feel like youre getting it together yeah i look pretty good  feeling good looking good  but when youre naked its like its so final youre just well  thats it  theres nothing else i can do  thats why i like to wear a belt when im naked  because i feel it gives me something  some you know im naked but you know  id like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be  wouldnt that be the ultimate thing  to be naked and still be able to do this  i think that would really help a lot  a mental institution  you know what they do in there did you see cuckoos nest  they put those electrodes in your head  its not really a mental institution  its more like a depression clinic  she went out to woodhaven and checked herself in im sick over this  who told you this her roommate  ive driven women to lesbianism before  but never to a mental institution  my friend bob sacamano had shock treatments  but his synapses were so large had no effect  you know i hate to raise a crass financial concern  but was there any information as to the whereabouts of my papers  she put them in her pocketbook she probably took them out there with her  so what now i dont know  can we go out there  where woodhaven  we could  im very nervous about this  ive never spoken to a mental patient before  my cousin douglas was in a place like this one time  came over to my house for dinner there was no soda  and he went berserk  he was screaming wheres the pepsi wheres the pepsi  i should be in a place like this  i envy this woman  get to wear slippers all day  friends visit they pity you  pitys very underrated i like it its good  plus they give you those word association tests i love those  theyre great theres no wrong answer  potato tuberculosis  blanket leroy  grass tuberculosis  oh boy here she comes  oh my god  oh kram  kramer kramer could you please  put something on  well oh boy  listen you want some leftovers  i made some african food theres yambalas and sambusa  sweetie  are you coming back to bed yeah yeah ill be right there babe  hi elaine  what did you think of the coffee table  its invisible  so is everything cool or what  yeah you seem a little bit dysfunctional  well come on elaine  just tell us the truth  the truth  you want the truth  who are you  this is my friend  jerry  why are you talking like that  and what do you want  want what could i possibly want  i just came because i heard so many nice things about you from george  gorge thinks im pretentious  pretentious who isnt pretentious i mean  if everyone that was pretentious was in a mental institution  obviously this isnt a mental institution  youre trying to take it back because youre feeling guilty im in here  no thats not it at all dont lie george  im not a liar  were cool everythings cool  no problem were good just chatting  very friendly  alrighty  no reason for us to raise our voices  i know what you said you cant change that  what i said i say stupid things all the time  i cant go two minutes without saying something dumb  its one stupid thing after another  so let me ask you when you come to one of these places  do you bring your pocketbook  you should be the one criticizing me  im lucky to even know someone like you  do you mean that of course  im incapable of guile hes never guiled  you know some women keep a lot of important papers in their pocketbooks  like for example  someone elses personal financial papers  papers  oh jerry youre the jerome with the tax problem  you know after that date with george  i got so cuckoo i threw out all your papers  so id love to help you but ill just need the copies  there are no copies  so  are you saying you want to continue seeing me  who makes copies  the truth is  i think  you make a very nice couple  oh kramer  here kramer no no  lets go to the couch  yes im trying to get a copy of a receipt  for a computer that i bought there  it was 1 98 7  i remember i talked to a guy had like a maroon sport jacket  and he might have had a toupee oh it was a weave  okay well then ill come by  okay bye  anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street  i think i may have tracked down another receipt  i cant i got to go visit tina in the hospital  george im going to a poetry reading  with patrice  firsttime poets  its in a burntout building down by the docks  its supposed to be good  are you going to the hospital now  yeah i suppose i am all right great great  well share a cab  you going by 48th you can give me a ride  im getting in on that  yeah you know youre chipping in  youre going that way anyway  come on  i was audited last year i have been through an audit  at first i thought well irs kind of sounds like toys r us  maybe it wont be so bad maybe they have a sense of fun about it  you know but its bad its an ordeal  and they dont do anything to keep your spirits up  through the ordeal  i think they should take all your receipts and put them  in one of those big lucite sweepstake drums  and just kind of crank it around there  give you a feeling like you might win something you know what i mean  then they can pull them out and go  oh im sorry thats another illegal deduction  but we do have some lovely parting gifts for you jail
