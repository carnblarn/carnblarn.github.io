two guys never met each other ever in life  this is the male code  and it doesnt matter how important the arrangements are  most of the time they screw up a space shuttle mission its because  one of the astronauts met someone on his way to the launch pad  they hold that countdown  hes leaning against the rocket  so when i get back what do you say we get together for some tang  oh look at what
