                i was watching women in the department store trying on clothes  and i notice that they do it differently from men  women dont try on the clothes they get behind the clothes  they take a dress off the rack  and they hold it up against themself  they can tell something from this  they stick one leg way out  they need to know  if someday im onelegged at a 45degree angle  what am i gonna wear  you never see a man do that see a guy take a suit off the rack  put his head in the neck go what about this suit ill get it looks fine  put some shoes by the bottom of the pants i want to make sure  perfect now what if im walking move the shoes move the shoes  move the shoes  what are you doing  all right all right  whats the matter with that what about that one  robert vaughn the helsinki formula  he was good in man from un cle  guess whose birthday is coming up soon  i know i know im having my root canal the same week  i hope you got a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious  hey lookit naked people  no i dont want to see the naked people  been a while  i have a vague recollection of doing something with someone  but it was a long long time ago  i think my last time was in rochester  my hair was a lot shorter  i remember that its a good thing  and someday i hope to do it again  what  what   what was that look  what look  the look you just gave me   i gave a look  yes   what kind of a look  i know that look   so what was it  why should i tell you  well youre the big look expert  i want to see how smart you are  trust me i know the look   so  what   what about the look  i dont know   you got something on your mind  no  things pop into your head  you  things occur to me from time to time  yeah me too  well you cant expect to just forget the past completely  well no of course not  i mean its something we did  probably about  what 25 times  thirtyseven  yeah we pretty much know what were doing in there   we know the terrain  no big surprises  nope   what do you think  i dont know what do you think  well its something to consider   yeah  i mean lets say  what if  we did  what if  is that like the end of the world or something   certainly not  why shouldnt we be able to do that  once in a while if we want to  i know  i mean really what is the big deal  we go in there  were in there for a while then we come back out here  thats not complicated  its almost stupid if we didnt   its moronic  absurd  course  i guess maybe some little problems could arise  there are always a few  i mean if anything happened  and we couldnt be friends the way we are now that would really be bad   devastating  because this is very good  and that would be good  that would be good too  the idea is to combine the this  and the that  but this cannot be disturbed  yeah we just want to take this  and add that  but of course wed have to figure out a way  to avoid the things that cause the little problems  maybe some rules or something  for example  now i call you whenever im inclined and vice versa  but if we did that we might feel  a certain obligation to call  well why should that be  i have an idea  no calls the day after that  beautiful  lets make it a rule  all right sir   now heres another little rule  yeah  when we see each other now  we retire to our separate quarters  but sometimes when people get involved with that  they feel pressure  to sleep over  when that  is not really sleep  sleep is separate from that and i dont see  why sleep got all tied up and connected  with that  okay okay rule number two spending the night is optional  well now were getting somewhere  good   what about the kiss good night  tough one  your call  its bourgeois  fine  well  well  you ready  ready  so you think you can handle this  definitely   hey  hey   got the paper  not yet   no paper  i havent been out yet  well whats taking you so long  oh yeah  whats the deal with aquaman  could he go on the land or was he just restricted to water  no i think i saw him on land a couple times  so hows the job situation going  still looking  pretty bad out there what about you  nothing much i slept with elaine last night  oxygen i need some oxygen   this is major  i thought youd like that  oh this is huge   i know  all right okay lets go details  no i cant give details   you what  i cant give details  no details  im not in the mood  you ask me here to have lunch  tell me you slept with elaine  and then say youre not in the mood for details  now you listen to me  i want details and i want them right now  i dont have a job i have no place to go  youre not in the mood well you get in the mood  all right okay  we were in my apartment watching tv   where you sitting  on the couch   next to each other  separate   time  around 1 1  okay go ahead  so shes flipping around the tv  and she gets to the naked station  see thats why i dont have cable because of that naked station  if i had that in my house i would never turn it off  i wouldnt sleep i wouldnt eat  eventually firemen would break through the door  theyd find me in my pyjamas with drool coming down my face  all right so youre watching the naked station  and then  somehow we started talking about what if we had sex  boy these are really bad details  it pains me to say this but i may be getting too mature for details  i hate to hear this  any kind of growth really irritates me   ill tell you it was really passionate  better than before  she must have taken some kind of seminar or something  this is all too much so what are you feeling  whats going on are you like a couple again now   not exactly   not exactly what does that mean  well weve tried to arrange a situation  where well be able to do this once in a while  and still be friends  what  where are you living  are you here are you on this planet  its impossible it cant be done  thousands of years people have tried to have their cake and eat it too  so all of a sudden the two of you are gonna come along and do it  where do you get the ego  no one can do it it cant be done  i think weve worked out a system  you know what youre like youre like a pathetic gambler  one of these losers in las vegas who keeps thinking  hes gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack  no this is very advanced weve designed a set of rules  that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all the relationship pitfalls  all right all right tell me the rules  okay  no calls the next day  so you have the sex next day you dont have to call  thats pretty good   go ahead  you ready for the second one  i have to tell you im very impressed with the first one  spending the night  optional  no no you see you got greedy  no thats the rule its optional  i know less about women  than anyone in the world  but the one thing i do know is theyre not happy if you dont spend the night  it could be a hot sweaty room with no air conditioning  and all they have is a little army cot this wide  youre not going anywhere   i think youre wrong  i hope i am   is this yours or the roommates  roommates   would she mind  she keeps track of everything  well thats too bad because im taking it  oh thanks  well  guess ill get going  i got that root canal tomorrow morning itll be easy if i go home  fine go ahead  i dont understand is there a problem  im getting the impression theres a problem   just go  im having surgery tomorrow   surgery youre going to the dentist  you said it could be very serious  okay so fine go  what happened to the rules remember  sleeping over was optional   its my house its my option  it has nothing to do with that   of course it does  hi   hi  hi   hi jerry  hi  such a great improv class tonight  really  i had this improv  where i pretended  i was working in one of those booths in an amusement park  where you shoot water in the clowns mouth and blow up the balloon  tina could you excuse us for just one second  yeah  ill excuse you   what are you doing  i cant go if youre mad  im not mad  you seem a little mad  no jerry im fine really its okay  so youre okay with everything  definitely  are you  definitely  well  good night  good ni   what are you doing  what  the rules  hey

jewellery  no  you cant get her anything better than me  whatever i spend you have to spend half  what am i supposed to get a bazooka  you dont understand im in a very delicate position  whatever i give her shell be bringing in experts from all over the country  to interpret the meaning behind it  what does she need maybe theres something that she needs  i think i heard her say something about a bench  a bench   what kind of a bench  i dont know   she mentioned a bench  what like at a bus stop   i dont know  like a park bench  i have no idea   who puts a bench in the house  forget the bench  i got it you want something nice what about a music box  no too relationshipy  i mean she opens it up she hears that  laras theme im dead  okay what about a nice frame  with a picture of another guy in it  the frame says  i care for you but if you want to get serious  perhaps youd be interested in someone like this  nicelooking fellow   what about candleholders  too romantic   lingerie  too sexual   waffle maker  too domestic  bust of nelson rockefeller  too gubernatorial  lets work on the card  i had to buy a gift for someone  the hardest part is that card the card is a killer  i never know what its supposed to say  and its getting so tough because the relationships are so complicated  greetingcard companies now put out cards that are blank  on the inside nothing  no message its like the card company says  we give up you think of something  you know  for 7 5 cents i dont want to get involved   maybe you wont like it  how could i not like it   of course ill like it  you could not like it  just the fact that you remembered means everything  of course i remembered  you reminded me every day for two months  oh the card   cash  what do you think  you got me cash  this way i figure you could go out and get yourself whatever you want  no good  who are you my uncle  hey come on its 1 82 there i dont think thats anything to sneeze at  let me see the card  to a wonderful girl a great pal  and more  hey  elaine im glad youre here stay right here im gonna be right back stay   pal you think im your pal  i said and more  i am not your pal  whats wrong with pal why is everybody so down on pal   hey  oh what is this   you got me something  yeah yeah open it  kramer  the bench you got me the bench that i wanted   thats pretty good huh  great  you remember when she mentioned it i made a mental note of it  well goody for you  yeah see im very sensitive about that  i mean someones birthday comes up i keep my ears open  so what did you get her   cash  youve gotta be kidding what kind of gift is that  thats like something her uncle would give her  think where mans glory most begins and ends  and say my glory was i had such a friend  yeats  oh kramer  could you excuse us please  what  were talking  oh the relationship  you know we never had one fight before this deal   i know  never   ever  we got along beautifully   like clams  it was wonderful  a pleasure  so i think we should forget the whole deal and go back to being friends  i cant do it  you what  i cant do that  you mean its  no this  no that  no this or that  oh boy  what do you want  this that and the other  oh sure of course youre entitled  who doesnt want this that and the other  you  well  those birthdays  i told you theyre relationship killers  if a relationships having any problems whatsoever a birthday brings it out  i never should have made up those rules  what is it about sex that just disrupts everything  is it the touching is it the nudity  it cant be the nudity  i never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings  when i was changing before gym class  this means i cant see her anymore either   why  its breakup by association  besides shes mad at me anyway because of my birthday present  why what did you wind up giving her  ninetyone dollars  sorry about that  so what are you gonna do  if i call her theres no joking around anymore this is pretty much it  so maybe this should be it   could be it  she seems like an it  shes as it as you get  imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband  and she tells me that hes a sculptor they live in vermont  wed have to kill him  wed get caught id get the chair  id go to prison as your accomplice  have to wear that really heavy denim  the cafeteria with the guy who slops the mashed potatoes onto your plate  go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people  plus  you know what else  you better call her   hey  hey   you got the paper yet  yeah  well where is it   hey you done with that  no  well youre not reading it now  all right you can take it but i want it back  yeah yeah  so  what are you guys gonna do today  this and  that  and the other  boy i really liked the two of you much better when you werent a couple  why is commitment such a big problem for a man  i think that for some reason  when a man is driving down that freeway of life  the woman hes involved with is like an exit  but he doesnt want to get out he wants to keep driving  the woman is like  look gas food lodging thats our exit  thats everything we need to be happy  get out here now  but the man focuses on the sign underneath  that says  next exit 27 miles and he thinks  i can make it
