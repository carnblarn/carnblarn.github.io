back and forth back and forth  her hips swiveling  her breasts  convulsing  convulsing i dont know im trying to help you  so then i asked her if she wanted a drink  you dont drink i couldnt think of anything else to say  so you started drinking so we started drinking and  i dont know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia  but the next thing i knew she was mopping the floor with me  and how was it the sex was okay  but i threw up from the hennigans  good thing the cleaning lady was there  dick was fired  you mean to tell me i put that drink six inches over to the right  and this wouldnt have happened you knew he was an alcoholic  whyd you put the drink down what are you saying  im not saying anything yes you are  what could i be saying you must be saying something  if i was i would have said it  say it i said it  what did you say nothing  its exhausting being with you  yeah its george  come on up hey  let me ask you something  did george buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it  because it was cheaper  okay you just gave me the answer no i didnt  yes you did yes you did i saw your expression  i didnt have an expression i have a deviated septum  i have to  i have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe  how much did he save  frankly i am shocked that you could ask such a question of me  if l the only surprise was how you could even think of that  thats what you were seeing  i have to talk to you  this cleaning womans turning the screws on me  shes pushing for this whole relationship thing  she keeps calling me shes threatening to go to the boss  i could lose my job i gotta keep her quiet  elaines in the bathroom shes wise to the reddot thing  shes asking me all kinds of questions about it  did you tell her anything no  you swear im not swearing i dont wanna swear  come on swear no  oh you told her didnt you no  hey george did you buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it  because you could get it at a discount  what  did i what you did didnt you  elaine im shocked im shocked  here i go out in the spirit of the season and spend all my savings  to buy you the most beautiful christmas sweater i have ever seen  to show my appreciation to you at christmas  and this is the thanks i get at christmas  well jerry told me that you did you told her  how could you tell her what kind of friend are you  i didnt tell her you stupid idiot she tricked you  elaine you dont understand  i had a 103 temperature when i bought that sweater  i was so dizzy i was seeing red dots everywhere  i thought everything in the store had a red dot on it  i couldnt distinguish one red dot from the other  i couldnt afford anything  i have nothing i havent worked for a really long time  i mean look i have no clothes  look at what im wearing  it was just a little red dot  a little red dot  this is for you oh georgie you bought this for me  oh i knew you cared for me  as you care for me which is why its very important  that you never breathe a word to anyone about  you know what with clarence thomas and everything  okay can i open it now yes of course go ahead  my guess is youre gonna like this very much  ls that cashmere of course its cashmere  oh a cashmere sweater  oh georgie porgie  just a little something for christmas  when i was a little girl in panama a rich american came to our town  and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater  i said what do you call this beautiful fabric  and he said  they call it cashmere  i repeated the word cashmere cashmere  and i asked him if i could have it  and he said  no get away from me  and he started to walk away  oh but i grabbed onto his leg  screaming for him to give me the sweater  and he dragged me through the streets  and then he kicked me with the other foot  and he threw some change at me  but i didnt want the change georgie  i wanted the cashmere  i had a feeling you would like it  im going to try it on no dont try it on now try it later  oh look it fits beautiful  all right take it off youre gonna ruin it  whats this  i was in a mens room the other day  they had the hand blower instead of the paper towels you know this thing  i like the hand blower i have to say  takes a little bit longer but i feel when youre in a room  with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can  the only stench is coming from you  oh well wait a second  i believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen  dick i dont know what your problem is  its not my fault youre back on the wagon  its off the wagon  in the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town  i dont know on a wagon  dont you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way  you cant drink on a wagon its too bumpy  they had smooth trails what about the cumberland gap  what the hell do you know about wagons  i know enough not to get on them  im gonna get right to the point  its come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman  have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office  is that correct  who said that she did  was that wrong  should i not have done that  i got to plead ignorance on this thing  because if anyone had said anything to me  when i started here that that sort of thing was frowned upon  you know because ive worked in a lot of offices  and i tell you people do that all the time  youre fired  well you didnt have to say it like that  i want you out of here by the end of the day  what about the whole christmasspirit thing any flexibility there  no  oh wait wait wait  she wanted me to give you this  you had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman  you never had sex in the office before  no i once made out with someone but thats it  okay all right so you made out  well thats not sex kissing is sex  kissing is not sex  george jerry  hey did jerry leave that drink next to dicks on purpose  no george  over here  what are you doing here  im taking the kid out to dinner to cheer him up  hey jerry when do you consider sex has taken place  i would say  when the nipple makes its first appearance  so george told me that you left the drink next to dicks on purpose  nice try  so guess who heckled me at the club last night  merry christmas  oh my god thats dick dick  dick  its cape fear  hide hide under the desk  move over get off of me  i have no room my foots sticking out  shut up hes coming  is that cashmere  of course its cashmere  whats this  but in a way i think i inadvertently turned this guy into an alcoholic  i hate being around alcoholics  theyre either saying how much they love you or how much they hate you  those are the two statements that scare me most  but i think hes okay now because i dont know how he feels about me  hes finally off the wagon you mean on the wagon  dont get smart
