gandhi loved triscuits  who is it  who is it its gina  who martins girlfriend  martin your nextdoor neighbor  oh martin  its martin i think hes dying he tried to kill himself with pills  what come on  let me get my robe we do not have time  two seconds theres no time  we dont have two seconds all right go ahead  no forget it no go ahead  no ill just wear the pajamas just get it  are you sure forget it come on  no ill go get the robe  its not too bad its not like a sunny von bulow coma  doctor said he should snap out of it any time  you know why he did this because i told him it was over  i did not want to see him anymore really its over  i could not stand it another minute  yesterday he turned over a hot dog stand  because he thought the man looked at me  then after he saw you in the hall he was crazy with jealousy  oh boy  did he say anything about me  he does not like you  and all indications are he does not like drakes coffee cake  he said that he was screaming about it all night  how its too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it  im sorry if i caused any trouble i was just being friendly  i wasnt  you werent  no i have thought about you many times  have you thought about me of course  tell me everything  are you sure he cant hear anything  martin  martin  i wish he was not in a coma i wish he was dead  i would like to pull the plug out from him  i would wait on that one  i know how you feel but juries today  you never know how theyre gonna look at this  i saw you looking at your watch you want to leave go ahead  i wanted to see what time it was are you afraid of him  no then kiss me  here yes right here  is this the proper venue  you dont want to no no i want to  i very much want to i desire to i pine to  then kiss me right in front of him  i cant what if he wakes up  a man is lying here unconscious and youre afraid of him  what kind of a man are you  im a man who respects a good coma  if it was one of those inandout comas maybe  but when a guys got a coma going like this  you dont wanna mess with it  hey hey  did you hear about martin yeah i heard  i cant believe hes in a coma hes got my vacuum cleaner  i loaned it to him he never returned it the carpets are filthy  what am i gonna do who told you about martin  newman hes good friends with him  bigmouth newman i should have guessed  hes got all my attachments you know  let me ask you something how long do you have to wait  for a guy to come out of a coma before you ask his exgirlfriend out  oh gina  why wait why not just call dr kevorkian  i dont get that whole suicide machine  theres no tall buildings where these people live  they cant wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person  whats going on between you and gina  well i went with her to the hospital last night  so were in the room and shes trying to get me to kiss her in front of him  thats the great thing about mediterranean women  all right so what did you do  nothing what kind of a man are you  the guy is unconscious in a coma  and you dont have the guts to kiss his girlfriend  i didnt know what the coma etiquette was  there is no coma etiquette  see thats the beauty of the coma it doesnt matter what you do  so youre saying his girl his car his clothes its all up for grabs  you can just loot the coma victim  i give them 24 hours to get out of it  they cant get out of it by 24 hours its a land rush  so if the coma victim wakes up in a month  hes thrilled he got out of the coma  he goes home theres nothing left nothing left  thats why im trying to get that vacuum somebodys gonna grab it  martins spirit came to you as a warning  why would he come to george  because george has heightened extrasensory perception  faithy get your finger out of your nose  i knew it i always felt different you are some coffee cake  drakes yes  did you buy this for me no why  because i love drakes coffee cake  maybe i did take it away  she hasnt eaten in two days  whos pauline pauline  wait a minute oh my god  my brother once impregnated a woman named pauline  you think about her when i hear her name  cut these with your left hand  there was a woman audrey  she had a very big nose  i see an audrey but with a small nose  yes yes she had a nose job  i loved her very deeply  will she ever speak to me again  not in this life  should you be smoking does it bother you  youre pregnant elaine  i smoked when i had faithy  what what  i dont know about this trip george  you can see the cayman lslands in there  is something gonna happen to me what  its really bad for the fetus you know that  shes a psychic she knows how the kids gonna be  should i not go on this trip  george  i am going to tell you something and i want you to really hear me  now listen i just dont know how a person with everything  we now know about prenatal care can put a cigarette in her mouth  what are you doing its disgusting  i dont need this look please  i would like you both to leave oh fine  well i dont like to be around people who are just so irresponsible  get the hell out a plane crash a heart attack  lupus is it lupus  do you want me to call the super he was an lsraeli commando  if you dont say anything ill assume its a plane crash  get out not a plane crash  is it a plane crash  psychics should be licensed  and it wouldnt be hard we could just give them the regular dmv test  only with the silver dollars and the pizza dough over the eyes  if you can do the parallel park like that youre a psychic  we can test these people no question about it  like kreskin instead of just hiding his check  why dont we try stopping his check  lets see how he handles that  i do not like your toothbrush  there are no bristles  you can say what you want about me  but ill be damned if im gonna stand here  while you insult my toothbrush  it is too small for someone with such a big mouth  let me ask you  what will you do if martin wakes up run away like a mouse  no more like the three stooges at the end of every movie  who are these stooges you speak of  theyre a comedy team  tell me about them everything  well theyre three funnylooking guys and theyd hit each other a lot  you will show me the stooges i will show you the stooges  when well  i dont really know where the stooges are right now  but if i locate them youll be the first to know  come you walk me to a cab  well l  i dont want you to get upset or anything  but with martin and all maybe its not a good idea to be seen together  in the building because he had a lot of friends  you are still afraid you are not a man  well then what are all those ties and sports jackets doing in my closet  are you going to walk me to a cab or not  yeah all right all right  why dont you just eat fruit fruit makes me incontinent  i dont want you eating over here  hello gina hello jerry  hello newman  do you think newman would tell martin if he wakes up  what kind of sicko would do that he could kill me  people smoke elaine  my mother smoked  it didnt hurt me  did you guys see that wall move  boy its a good thing we came  could there be a native problem in the caymans  maybe theres native unrest  hi i havent eaten in three days  i was wondering how much longer it would be till i get my xray  well call you  george i want you to promise me something if im ever in a coma  in the first 24 hours get everything out of my place and put it in storage  how come looters  how do we know the dog foods any good  who tastes it  she is really hungry  hey kramer  well newmans upstairs visiting martin  would you buy my cayman lsland ticket  youre not going no  why not the psychic said  something terrible will happen  i dig  i want my vacuum cleaner  martin i know you can hear me  look my mothers coming to visit me she sees that rug shes gonna kill me  he cant hear you you idiot why dont you just buy another one  why would i buy another one when i spent 100 bucks on this one  i have a carpet sweeper you can use  i dont want a carpet sweeper they dont do anything  it gets my rug clean  the carpet sweeper is the biggest scam  perpetrated on the american public since one hour martinizing  you should take a look at my rug then  i wouldnt set foot in your house  hello hey  hello jerry  hows he doing well he looks happy to me  i hope he stays this happy when he wakes up  why wouldnt he no reason  hell have a lot of catching up to do i guess  ill bring him up to date  how up to date all the way up  nothing could change your mind  well it would take a lot because a friend is something you earn  jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the cayman lslands this weekend  hes not going  i dont care much for the beach i freckle  ls that a drakes coffee cake  where did you get that  from my house i got a whole box of them  boy thats the fullsize  thats your big boy  can i have a bite  i dont like to give out bites  i got another one  but im saving it for later  just one bite  i dont think so you know theyre so fragile  all right all right  i wont say anything  you swear i swear  on your mothers life on my mothers life  but here it was  mountains of duck  and not fatty duck either but juicy tender breasts of duck  beautifully sliced faithy  sweetheart no dont run  you could take as much as you want  sweetheart sweetheart faithy  hi hi what are you doing here how did i know you were here  something drew me here this is phenomenal  the nurse said shed be back  supposed to take me to the delivery room  oh thats great thats great  i have to apologize for my friend the other day  friend i dont even know that woman  i met her on the way over i couldnt get rid of her  i tell you my psychic instincts were a little off  wheres the nurse im sure shell be right back  sweetheart why dont you run and get a nurse for mommy  i was just curious the other day you said something about my trip  dont take that trip yeah why why  because because all right rula its time to go  yeah because because  assassins how dare they keep a person waiting like this  drakes coffee cake  give me that jerry you better stop her or ill tell  elaine no no  are there terrorists on the plane a hotel fire is that it  typhus malaria yellow fever lupus is it lupus  they did it right in this bed martin right in front of you  i want my vacuum cleaner i can explain  it was disgusting  what are you doing were going to dinner in 10 minutes  i never assisted in a birth before  its really quite disgusting  what did she name the kid you wouldnt believe it  rasputin  hey hey  when did you get back a couple hours ago  so how was it george  i would like to thank you for the greatest four days of my life  they were shooting the sports illustrated swimsuit issue  right in the hotel pool not only that  the hotel opened up an area on the beach for nude bathing  and all of the models went down there  i am on the next blanket from elle macpherson  we played backgammon nude  oh shes a sweet kid nude backgammon  with swimsuit models  oh you know what the second day i was there i stepped on a jellyfish  it stung my foot thats probably what rula was trying to warn you about  you gotta watch for the jellyfish yeah  whats this  its an invitation to a housewarming for martin and gina  they moved in together yeah some place in the village  yeah its elaine  all right were coming down  where you going were taking elaine to dinner  shes gotta start the fast again you wanna go  id like to but a bunch of us from the islands are getting together  elle macpherson gonna be there i gotta call her back  the thing i dont understand about the suicide person  is the people that try and commit suicide  for some reason they dont die and then thats it they stop trying  why  why dont they just keep trying what has changed is their life better  no in fact its worse because now theyve found out  heres one more thing you stink at  thats why these people dont succeed at life to begin with  because they give up too easy i say pills dont work try a rope  car wont start in the garage get a tuneup you know what i mean  theres nothing more rewarding  than reaching a goal youve set for yourself
