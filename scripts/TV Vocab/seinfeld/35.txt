                at the health club people are working out  and theyre training getting in shape  but strangely nobodys really getting in shape for anything  the only reason that youre getting in shape  is that so you can get through the workout  so were working out  so that well be in shape for when we have to do our exercise  this is the whole thing  the other thing i dont get is why were so careful  about locking up our dirty towels and smelly jockstraps  what exactly is the black market on these disgusting gym clothes  ill give my car to any guy in front of a restaurant  because hes got a short red jacket  he must be the valet guy  but my stinking putrefied gym clothes  i got one of these locks  you could put a bullet through it and it wont open  that stuff is safe  wide open i was wideopen underneath  i had three inches on that guy  see you two were hogging the ball  me it wasnt me i never even saw the ball  all you do is dribble  i have to dribble lf i give it to you you just shoot youre a chucker  oh im a chucker thats right  every time you get the ball you shoot  i cant believe you called me a chucker  no way im a chucker i do not chuck never chuck  never have chucked never will chuck no chuck  you chuck  kramer am i a chucker oh youre a chucker  my god im a chucker  all these years you never told me its not an easy thing to bring up  hey you know this is the first time we ever saw each other naked  believe me i didnt see anything  oh you didnt sneak a peek  no did you yeah i snuck a peek  why why not  what about you george  yeah l  snuck a peek  but it was so

around all season  wouldnt you think thered be a plane crash  are you performing in new york now  at this club on the east side you should come in  but think about it  youd think eventually an entire team would just get wiped out  i live on the east side  ill give you my number  and just tell me whenever you want to go  or maybe just get together for coffee oh thatd be great  well its only a matter of time  whos this chucker  its been three days and he hasnt called  well maybe you should call him  i cant i cant  why not i just feel like he should call me  whats the difference  you dont

hernandez  hate him i despise him  why why ill tell you why  let me tell her no you cant  you always tell all right tell it  just tell it all right  june 14th 1987 metsphillies  were enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the rightfield stands  when a crucial hernandez error opens the door  to a fiverun phillies ninth cost the mets the game  our day was ruined  there was a lot of people waiting by the players parking lot  now were coming down the ramp  newman was in front of me  hernandez was coming toward us  as he passes us newman turns and says nice game pretty boy  hernandez continued past us up the ramp  then a second later something happened  that changed us in a very deep and profound way  from that day forward  what was it he spit on us  and i screamed out im hit  then i turned and the spit ricocheted off him and it hit me  what a story  unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict  the whole premise of your account  allow me to reconstruct this if i may for ms benes  as ive heard this story a number of times  newman kramer if youll indulge me  according to your story  hernandez passes you and starts walking up the ramp  then you say you were struck  on the right temple  the spit then proceeds to ricochet  off the temple striking newman between the third and the fourth rib  the spit then came off the rib  made a right turn hitting newman in the right wrist  causing him to drop his baseball cap  the spit then splashed off the wrist pauses  in midair mind you  makes a left turn and lands on newmans left thigh  that is one magic loogie  well thats the way it happened  what happened to your head when you got hit  well my head  went back to the left  say that again back and to the left  back and to the left  back and to the left  so what are you saying  im saying  that the spit could not have come from behind  that there had to have been a second spitter  behind the bushes on the gravelly road  lf the spitter was behind you as you claim  that wouldve caused your head to pitch forward  so the spit couldve only come from the front and to the right  but thats not what they would have you believe  im leaving  jerrys a nut  wait wait wait  the sad thing is we may never know the real truth  did anybody call asking for vandalay industries  no what happened to you all right listen closely  i was at the unemployment office  i told them i was very close to getting a job with vandalay industries  and i gave them your phone number so when the phone rings  you have to answer vandalay industries  im vandalay industries right  what is that
