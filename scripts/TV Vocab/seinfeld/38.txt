right lenny  thanks again  take care  thats lenny west my accountant whos a hell of a guy  he handles the yankees too its his biggest account  so every once in a while they throw him a couple of seats

similarity  well weve made our decision  we want the kramer  five thousand why would anybody buy kramer for 5000  boy the yankees cannot buy a hit tonight  so is it all over between you and marsha mason  yeah  and by the way can you get this thing out of my house  ill make a deal with you   ill sell it to you for 10 bucks  please  seems to be a lot of trouble in the area just behind the yank ee dugout  behind the dugout thats where we were sitting the other night  were not gonna show it dont want to encourage that kind of behaviour  its a young lady and shes really going at it with the security guard  shes a feisty one theyre getting the other security guard to come down  how do you lik e that seaver  and boy shes something and a baltimore fan at that  holy cow  when i was 17 i ran away from home and hopped a steamship to sweden   this steak is excellent by the way  more potatoes  yeah yeah sure please  yes yes go on you hopped a steamship to sweden  it was a big one  baseball seasons starting im very excited about that  did you ever sneak down to better seats at the game  and get caught by the usher  when youre a kid youre getting chased from every place anyway  when youre an adult its really embarrassing  you have to pretend like theres some confusion  you put on this whole act youre looking at the tickets  i dont understand how this could have happened  let me see i see the problem  these are very good seats i have very bad seats  thats the misunderstanding
