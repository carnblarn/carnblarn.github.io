admit nothing  will you put that cigarette out please  i mean he was in the apartment  and then its gone and its in your apartment   maybe you think were in cahoots  no  but its quite a coincidence

happy about this  why dont we just throw a molotov cocktail through their window  theres just no justice  this experience has changed me  its made me more cynical more bitter more jaded   really  sure why not  how do you think i feel  instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent  i am proofreading a foodallergy cookbook   cant you talk to your boss  i did  he loves rava  worse he loves ray  and he doesnt think youre funny at all  im not happy about this  perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge  that in the next world ray will be the recipient  of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice  yeah hell have my parents  police open up  police   freeze mama  hey hey  shut up spread them  i said spread them  youre in big trouble son  burglary grand larceny  possession
