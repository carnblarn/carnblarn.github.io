outfit  its all so coordinated the little socks match the little shirt  i really hate this guy  oh im gonna faint  george  who is that woman in the stripes  i dont know her  she looks so familiar  its

bucks in it for you if you do it  what do you mean  you walk over to that table  you pick up an egg roll you dont say anything  you eat it  say thank you very much  wipe your mouth walk away  i give

in a society  were supposed to act in a civilized way  does she care no  does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity  over the problems of a fellow individual  no no a resounding no   hey sorry i took so long  oh thats okay  really dont worry about it  how do people fast  did gandhi get this crazy  im gonna go walk around and see what dishes look good  i told my uncle i had a stomachache think he bought that  yeah he probably bought it  so what happened with tatiana   i shouldnt even tell you  come on  after dinner last week she invites me to her apartment  im with you  well its this little place with this little bathroom  and its like right there you know its not even  down a little hall or off in an alcove you understand  theres no  buffer zone  so  we start to fool around  and its the first time and its early in the going  and i begin to perceive this impending  intestinal requirement  whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths  anything in the sexual realm  so i know im gonna have to stop  and as this is happening im thinking even if i can somehow manage  to momentarily  extricate myself from the proceedings  and relieve this unstoppable force  i know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me  with the privacy that i know im going to need  this could only happen to you  so  i finally stop and say  tatiana i hope you dont take this the wrong way  but i think it would be best if i left  you said this to her after  no  during   oh boy  yeah  wow so  so im dressing and shes staring up at me  struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events  i dont know what to say to reassure her  and worst of all i dont have the time to say it  the only excuse she might possibly have accepted  is if i told her i am in reality batman  and im very sorry i just saw the bat signal  it took me three days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again  now shes waiting for me to call and shes still on the phone  i hate this place  i dont know why we came here i am never coming back here again  who is that woman  remember when you first went out to eat with your parents  remember it was such a treat to go  and they serve you this different food that you never saw before  and they put it in front of you  and it was such a delicious and exciting adventure  and now i just feel like a big sweaty hog  waiting for them to fill up the trough  oh
