reach him sooner  oh lord the commotion also delayed  production of a woody allen movie that was shooting up the block  a spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker  said that mr allen was extremely agitated  and wondered if his days of shooting movies in new york were over  five seconds  jerry i was five seconds away from breaking up with him  five seconds the next words out of my mouth were owen its over  can he communicate yeah well he nods  and i think he understands me  he seems to enjoy it when i read to him  all right shes free  hi i called before my car got smashed  so listen what

coffee should cover it  oh man what are you doing here  i got fired from the movie  get out of here what what  well you know they were going to shoot it today  we rehearsed it twice and then woody yells action  i turn to him and i say  these pretzels are making me thirsty  right then i took a swig of beer  and i slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered  well one of the pieces mustve hit woody  and he started crying  and he yells out im bleeding and he runs off  anyway this woman she came up to me and she says youre fired  boy i really nailed that scene  oh wait a  oh for crying out loud  the best part of a relationship is when youre sick  the best part of being sick is when youre in a relationship  but if i got married you know those vows  for richer or for poorer for better or for worse  all i need is the sickness that is the most important one  do you take this man in sickness  thats the time i need somebody there  the rest of the time go out have a ball  but if i get the sniffles you better be there
