   why are we buying                all this food            i think superman                 probably has a very              good sense of humor                          i never heard him                say anything funny   its common sense                hes got super strength         super speed                       im sure hes got                super humor                                 youd think that                but either youre                born with humor                   or youre not                   it doesnt change                even after going                 from
