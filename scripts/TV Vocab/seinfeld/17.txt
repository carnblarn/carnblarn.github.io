the face  flying doesnt make me nervous driving to the airport  can make you very nervous  because when youre flying getting on a plane  if you miss that plane theres no alternative  on the ground you have options  you have buses you have taxis you have trains  but when youre taking a flight if you miss it thats it  no airline goes well you missed the flight we do have a cannon  leaving in 1 0 minutes would you be interested in that  its not a direct cannon you have to change cannons after you land  sir where are you going chicago  oh dallas all right wait a second  dallas thats about dallas texas anyway you should hit texas ready  get out of the net immediately  because we shoot the luggage in right after you  get up the alarm didnt go off youre gonna miss the plane its 9 1 5   9

minutes to get  it takes 45 minutes to get there that will only leave me five minutes  to get to the plane  shut up and pack  and what if i dont make the plane youll have left then what do i do  youre talking too much   wheres my sweater  what   my brown sweater  what sweater   my brown sweater  you didnt bring a brown sweater   i got a brown sweater  here you want a sweater  you want a brown

the best public toilet  okay  54th and sixth  sperryrand building  mention my name shell give you the key  all right 65th and 1 0th  are you kidding  lincoln center alice tully hall the met  magnificent facilities  i never knew i could drive like that  i was going faster than ive ever gone before  and yet it all seemed to be happening in slow motion  i was seeing three and four moves ahead  weaving in and out of lanes like an olympic skier on a goldmedal run  i knew i was challenging the very laws of physics  at queens boulevard i took the shoulder  at jewel avenue i used the median  i had it i was there and then  i hit the van wyck  they say no ones ever beaten the van wyck  but gentlemen i tell you this  i came as close as anyone ever has  and if it hadnt been for that fivecar pileup  on rockaway boulevard  that numbskull  would be on a plane for seattle right now  instead of looking for a parking space  downstairs   you did everything  you tried  the busboys coming   the busboys coming  the busboys coming   you dont mean here  i buzzed him in hes on his way up  hes coming up ill check you out later   where are you going  im the one he wants   hes coming to settle the score  no you three all know each other  theres no point in me getting involved at this stage  no hes not gonna do anything i guarantee it  the hell with it let him kill me l  antonio antonio in here  hey antonio hows it going  three nights ago  a gas main beneath the restaurant exploded  killing five people in my section  including the busboy who replaced me  if im not fired that night because of you  and your thoughtless stupid insensitive remarks  it would have been me  you saved my life  come on   yeah  its eddie   hes coming up  and the same night of the accident  while looking for paquita  i find a job in a restaurant where they pay me  almost twice what i was making before  and when i returned to the apartment  paquita perhaps frightened from the explosion  had miraculously returned  well  now i must go for today i am starting my new wonderful job  and i am very late  thank you  thank you thank you all  hey watch where youre going you almost knocked my head off  why dont you watch where youre going okay   because you bumped into me  who do you think youre talking to  hey get your hands off me  you go to hell  hell get another job  hes a busboy  it wont be for a while  at least not till after the cast comes off  that fall down the stairs thats what did it  thats not how it happened  its when he fell on him with his knee  that was awful poor antonio  thanks  so much longer  till when till he goes back to seattle or till he can feed himself  i guess its not important  take care of yourselves  i should probably get going too  if i dont feed paquita by 7 she goes all over everything  take it easy  yeah  how you doing  first of all i cant believe that people actually do fight  people have fistfights in life i cant really believe  that we have boxing either its really an amazing thing  the problem with boxing you have two guys having a fight  that have no prior argument  why dont they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars  drive around a bit have a little accident they get out   didnt you see my signal look at that fender  then youd see a real fight
