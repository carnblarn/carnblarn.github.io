police car in which he was being held  tobias lehigh nagy who is also wanted  in connection with unrelated slayings in the northwest  is still at large his whereabouts unknown  he is described as 55 bald  and reputedly a very generous tipper  the thing about la to me that kind of threw me  was when you know they have the smog alerts out there  and they actually recommend that people stay indoors  during the smog alert now maybe im way off  but dont you think  wouldnt you assume that the air in the house  pretty much comes from the air in the city where the house is  what do they think we live in a jar  with a couple of holes punched in the top  what the hells going on out there its very strange  do you realize it is now possible for parents to say to their children  all right kids i want you in the house and get some fresh air  summer vacation everybody indoors
