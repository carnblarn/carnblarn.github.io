control these circumstances and schedules  and peoples availabilities shell still see it  youre not stopping her how does sitting next to a person  in a movie theater increase the enjoyment  you cant talk during a movie  this is stupid come on  lets just go good  saving movies ridiculous  two for prognosis negative  im in big trouble oh youre dead  bells palsy  the entire side of of my face  was

taking care of your dog for a week  but if you dont mind  prediction youll be calling me to ask if you can come and visit him  before the month is out  prediction i never see you or him again for the rest of my life  we made plans  why dont we just rent a movie  i thought you wanted to see prognosis negative  no its supposed to be really bad really bad  i mean its long theres no story  its so unbelievably boring i heard l  jerry you promised me wed go  well george told me the whole story line for line  i almost feel like ive seen it already and walked out on it  wait george saw the movie i saw him yesterday he didnt mention it  you and george got together  yeah i wanted to talk about how we had nothing to talk about  hello  hi hi hi    well you were right  about what ellen  we broke up again  too bad  i thought she was the one  ill bring back the pot  okay come on its movie time  hey what are you gonna see prognosis negative  thats supposed to be great its not  well how do you know i have an instinct for these things  i had a parakeet when i was a kid that was the only pet i really enjoyed  we used to let him out of his cage  and he would fly around and my mother had built  one entire wall of our living room was mirrored  she felt this gives you a feeling of space  have you ever heard this interiordesign principle  the mirror makes it seem like you have another room  who walks up to a mirror and goes  hey look theres a whole other room in there  theres a guy in there looks just like me  but the parakeet will fall for this you let him out he flies around  bang with his little head he would just go  id always think even if he thinks the mirror is another room  why doesnt he at least try and avoid hitting the other parakeet
