previous years president  and this year we are honoring  morty seinfeld  morty  a man who slept more hours on the job than ronald reagan  slept on the job  being president of the condo is not easy  it requires hard work dedication and commitment  and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities  i wonder what he ever did  hes joking  his administration did excel in one department  the hiring of incompetents  thats what you say  but we do owe him a debt of gratitude  because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk  it put mrs ziven out of commission for a few weeks  tell them about when you took my sons pen back  tell them about that  dad  he gave my son a pen and then he takes it back  tell them that i took it back  he gave it to me thats enough sit down  im not finished give me

brilliant lawyer  he says jack has no case  ill ask him when he gets up  oh and i spoke to arnold  and he says that according to the bylaws of the condo constitution  they need six votes to throw you out for unruly behavior  not five  dr chernov is the one youll have to suck up to  oh my back  oh my back  that bar who the hell could sleep on that thing  i was very comfortable morty  arnold says
