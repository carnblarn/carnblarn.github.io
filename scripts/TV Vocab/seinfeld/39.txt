then we went through  and then they started to follow us  so george tries to lose them and and  but but they were in this really like a soupedup car you know  and so he turned off the road really suddenly  and the car was on two wheels and i was just screaming  and then george is such a great driver   he is  he is fantastic  and then they fired a gun right up in the air   a gun  i think it was a gun  and then they followed us all the way into the city  and then they stopped and they turned around and they went home  oh my god are you okay   yeah yeah im all right god  oh man  by the way the car hit a pothole and now its making a clanking noise  well i mean as long as youre okay that  thats the important thing  exactly  wheres george now  hes out in front arguing with some guy about a

eight  nine  ten  people will kill each other for a parking space in new york  because they think  if i dont get this one i may never get a space  you know  ill circle for months until somebody goes out to the hamptons  everybody in new york city knows theres gotta be way more cars  than parking spaces  you see cars driving in new york all hours of the night  its like musical chairs except everybody sat down around 1964  the problem is car manufacturers are building hundreds of thousands  of new cars every year  theyre not making any new spaces  thats what they should work on wouldnt that be great  you go to the auto show they got that big revolving turntable  and theres nothing on it  new from chrysler a space
