everything with you comes down to toilet paper   what  thats always  the first question with you why is that always your focus   then what did they do  i dont know  maybe they gave out big loose clumps to all the soldiers  it would be nice if there was some sort of historical record of it  they should have a toiletpaper museum would you like that  so we could see all the toiletpaper advancements down through the ages  toilet paper during the crusades  the development of the perforation the first sixpack  excuse me jerry  im stu schirmack im from nbc   could we speak for a few

gymnastics team in high school and youre married  your son is not interested in gymnastics and youre pushing him  why should i care if my sons into gymnastics   youre the teacher its only natural  but gymnastics is not for everybody   i know but hes your son  so what  all right forget that idea  its not for you  okay okay i got it  you run an antique store   yeah and  and people come into the store  and you get involved in their lives  what person who runs an antique store gets involved in peoples lives   why not  so someone comes in  to buy an old lamp and suddenly im getting them out of a jam  i could see if i was a pharmacist  because a pharmacist knows whats wrong with everybody  antiques are very popular right now   no theyre not they used to be  oh sure   like you know  oh like you do  and youre the manager of the circus   the circus  oh come on this is a great idea  look at the characters you got all these freaks in the show  a woman with a mustache  who wouldnt tune in to see a woman with a mustache  you got the tallest man in the world a guy whos just a head   i dont think so  look  the show isnt about the circus its about watching freaks  i dont think the network would go for it   why not  im not pitching a show about freaks  oh come on jerry youre wrong people they wanna watch freaks  this is a cant miss   kramer  hello newman  i got the helmet go get the radar detector  okay ill be back in a second you guys coming to my party   yeah sure  of course   whats this about  were making a trade  im giving him my motorcycle helmet hes giving me his radar detector   i didnt know you have a motorcycle  well my girlfriend had one  you have a girlfriend  i had a girlfriend  and she was pretty wild   i dont remember you with a girl  nevertheless  this is a pretty bad deal for kramer  a radar detectors worth much more than that helmet youre cheating him   dont say anything  all right  hey you know youre getting gypped over here  really  hey we had a deal  are you

i cant believe she got involved with her shrink  what about the tv show got anything  no nothing  why dont they have salsa on the table  what do you need salsa for  salsa is now the numberone condiment in america  do you know why  because people like to say salsa  do you have any salsa  we need more salsa where is the salsa no salsa  you know it must be impossible for a spanish person  to order seltzer and not get salsa  i wanted seltzer not salsa  dont you know the difference between them  you have the seltzer after the salsa  this should be the show this is the show   what  this  just talking  yeah right  no im really serious i think thats a good idea  just talking well whats the show about  its about nothing   no story  no forget the story   you gotta have a story  who says you gotta have a story  remember when we were waiting for that table in that chinese restaurant  that could be a tv show  and whos on the show who are the characters  i could be a character   you  yeah you base a character on me  so on the show theres a character named george costanza  yeah what theres something wrong with that im a character  people are always saying to me you know youre quite a character  and who else is on the show  elaine could be a character kramer  now hes a character  so everybody i know is a character on the show  right   and its about nothing  absolutely nothing  so youre saying i go into nbc and tell them  i got this idea for a show about nothing  we go into nbc  we since when are you a writer  what writer were talking about a sitcom  you wanna go with me to nbc  yeah we really got something here   what do we got  an idea   what idea  an idea for the show   i still dont know what the idea is  its about nothing   right  everybodys doing something  well do nothing  we go into nbc tell them we got an idea for a show about nothing   exactly  whats your show about   i say nothing  there you go  i think you may have something here  so the show would be about my real life  and one of the characters would be based on you  no i dont think so  what do you mean you dont you think so   i dont like it  i dont understand   what dont you like  i dont like the idea  of a character based on me  why not  i dont know it just doesnt sit well  youre my neighbor theres gotta be a character   thats your problem buddy  i dont understand what the deal is  okay you can do it on one condition   whatever you want  i get to play kramer   you cant play kramer  i am kramer  but you cant act   okay fine well use newman  newman   use me for what  nothing what do you want  well youll never guess what happened to me today  i was driving home on the palisades parkway  when i look in the rearview mirror and what did i see  the fuzz and its funny  because my new radar detector was on but i didnt hear a thing   isnt that strange  yeah thats strange  because the radar detector as i understand it detects radar  with a series of beeps and flashing lights  but for some reason i didnt hear a thing  except for the sound of a police siren  well thats queer huh  i want my helmet back  you give me back my helmet and pay for that ticket  oh yeah yeah you better think again mojumbo  you gave me a defective detector   jerry  buyer beware  are you gonna give me back my helmet  no we had a deal theres no guarantees in life  no but theres karma kramer  karma kramer  and one more thing  im not coming to your party  salsa seltzer  do you have any salsa  no not seltzer salsa   whats the matter  nothing  you sure   you look a little pale  no im fine im good  fine very good   what are you nervous  no im not nervous im very good   i cant do this i cant do this  what  i cant ive tried im here its impossible   this was your idea  what idea  i just said something i didnt know you were gonna listen to me  dont worry about it  theyre just tv executives  theyre men with jobs jerry  they wear suits and ties  theyre married they have secretaries   i told you not to come  i need some water  i gotta get some water   theyll give us water in there  really  thats pretty good   oh god its joe davola  who  this guys a writer hes a total nut  i think he goes to the same shrink as elaine  oh god he saw me   hello jerry  hey joe  how you doing  youre under no obligation to shake my hand  oh no just a custom  thats my friend george  you look good  why shouldnt i look good  no no reason you do the karate right  yeah you wanna hit me   what are you doing here  i dropped a script off  good for you  well   you dont have to say anything  no   hey i guess ill see you sunday night  why  kramers party   kramers having a party  no no hes not having a party  hes doing something i dont know its nothing hes not doing anything  i thought kramer and i were very close friends  no im sure you are im sure youre very close friends  very close  give my best to hinckley   what was that  i cant believe what i did  i didnt know kramer didnt invite him i gotta call kramer  theyre ready for you  okay okay look   you you do all the talking okay  oh relax   who are they  yeah   theyre not better than me  of course not   who are they  theyre nobody   what about me  what about you   why them why not me  why not you   im just as good as them  better   you really think so  no  the bit the bit i really liked was where the parakeet flew into the mirror  that was funny  the parakeet in the mirror that is a good one stu  yeah one of my favorites  what about you george have you written anything we might know  well possibly i  i wrote an offbroadway show  la cocina  actually it was offoff broadway  it was a comedy about a mexican chef  it was it was very funny  there was one great scene with the chef  what was his name   pepe  oh pepe yes pepe  and he was making tamales  oh he actually cooked on the stage  no no he mimed it thats what was so funny about it  so what have you two come up with  we thought about this in a variety of ways  but the basic idea is i play myself  may i  go ahead  i think i can sum up the show for you with one word  nothing   nothing  nothing  what does that mean  the show is about nothing   its not about nothing  no its about nothing  well maybe in philosophy  but even nothing is something  mr dalrymple your niece is on the phone   ill call back  dalrlmpel  not even close   is that with a y  no   whats the premise  as i was saying i would play myself  as a comedian living in new york  and i have a friend and a neighbor and an exgirlfriend   which is all true  but nothing happens on the show  you see its just like life  you know you eat you go shopping you read you eat  you read you go shopping  you read  you read on the show  well i dont know about the reading we didnt discuss the reading  all right tell me about the stories   what kind of stories  oh no no stories  no stories   so what is it  what did you do today   i got up and came to work  theres a show thats a show  how is that a show  well maybe something happens to you on the way to work  no no no nothing happens  well something happens   well why am i watching it  because its on tv  not yet  okay look  if you wanna just keep doing the same old thing  then maybe this idea is not for you  i for one am not going to compromise my artistic integrity  and ill tell you something else  this is the show and were not gonna change it  right  how about this  i manage a circus  i dont even wanna talk about it anymore  what were you thinking  what was going on in your mind  artistic integrity  well where did you come up with that  youre not artistic and you have no integrity  you really need some help a regular psychiatrist couldnt even help you  you need to go to like vienna or something  you know what i mean you need to get involved at the university level  like where freud studied and have people looking  and checking up on you thats the kind you need  not the onceaweek for 80 bucks no you need a team  a team of psychiatrists working round the clock  thinking about you having conferences  observing you like the way they did with the elephant man  thats what im talking about thats the only way youre gonna get better  i thought the woman was kind of cute  hold it i really wanna be clear about this  are you talking about the woman in the meeting  is that the woman youre talking about  yeah i thought i might give her a call  i dont meet that many women i meet like three women a year  i mean weve been introduced she knows my name   its completely inappropriate  why  maybe she liked me i mean she she was looking right at me  i think she was impressed  we had good eye contact through the whole meeting   oh i forgot to call kramer  wait a minute let me call susan   no this is more important  she might leave work any minute  no i gotta warn him that i told joe davola about his party  no  what is it  i was just thinking about this patient of mine  what  just wondering if hes taking his medication  come on were on vacation  well we were standing in the waiting area there  and you know how davola is hes all   yeah  its george  and so i felt very uncomfortable with him  and you know i just blurted out something about your party   back up a second  i didnt know that you didnt invite him  why would i invite him   well i just assumed that  assumed  never assume anything i dont want that nut in my house  you know hes on medication   well hello oh hello  hello  you remember susan from nbc   of course how are you  fine good to see you   this is kramer  hello  all right go ahead susan tell him   tell me what  well l  im sorry excuse me one second   hello  hi  would you be interested in switching to tmi long distance  oh l i cant talk right now  why dont you give me your home number and ill call you later  im sorry were not allowed to do that  i guess you dont want people calling you at home   no  well now you know how i feel   so go ahead tell him  well  kramer are you drinking that milk   yeah  whats the expiration date on that  september third   the third  the third  never should have brought her up there  should have known better  i should have seen it coming i didnt see it coming  i think she saw it coming  you know she was behind the idea she was gonna champion the show  i was bringing her up to tell you and she liked me  look just because kramer vomited on her doesnt mean the deal is dead  what are you crazy  its a traumatic thing to be thrown up on  vomiting is not a dealbreaker  if hitler had vomited on chamberlain  he still would have given him czechoslovakia  chamberlain  you could hold his head in the toilet hed still give you half of europe  what happened to you  davola came after me  what davola  see this guy is crazy i cant believe this what happened  can i get coffee you know i was walking home  i had to pick up my helmet from the shop i had to get a new strap  so i had it on and i was checking the strap out to make sure it fit  and suddenly i feel this kick hit me on the side of the head  it knocks me down i look up and its crazy joe davola  and he says thats what i think of your party  boy that is some kick  newmans helmet it saved my life look at that  wow newmans helmet  i got bad news for you buddy  davola says youre next  me why  he doesnt like you  what does he want from me i didnt do anything  see this is all elaines fault she took off to europe with his psychiatrist  he cant get his medication now i got some nut after me  pass the cream  wait a second  all right  when you vomit on somebody  it is a social faux pas  from which there is really no recovery  at that point theres really very little you can say to the person  theres no hallmark cards that cover this occasion  theres no vomit sympathycard section of the store you know  you wear it well you know theres no words  that really capture you know  next time lunch is on me  theres no really way to phrase the sentiment  where the hell did i put it   where did i put it  what are you looking for  the remote the remote i cant find the remote  did l i lost it did you take it   did you put it someplace  no no no  all right what is this   what is what  all right very funny i get it   youre in a weird mood  come on  go to your apartment and fix it   fix what  your pants  what is this why do i got one pant leg on for  dont you know look at your face  you only shaved the right side of your face   what is this a joke  no joke what a joke  you think this is funny  well look at your face in the mirror   yeah  its george  come on up   i dont believe this  you didnt know you were doing this  no i swear  ill bet this is from that kick from that crazy joe davola  you better see a doctor and get some xrays  just the man im looking for   me  yeah here you go   whats this  a drycleaning bill   from that woman at nbc  yeah  dry cleaning bill for what  for vomiting on her vest  oh come on george i didnt do that on purpose   i shouldnt have to pay  neither should i  jerry left the milk in the refrigerator   yeah its your milk  he drank it   i didnt know  all right  well we should all chip in i guess   yeah  how much was it to clean the vest  eighteen dollars  can you get vomit out of suede   i dont know  yoyo ma  what yoyo ma  what about him   you just said yoyo ma  whats yoyo ma  hes a cellist  you should see a doctor today  all right lets go six dollars  i cant believe she sent a cleaning bill  i know  and it doesnt really bode well for the show does it  forget about the show we should take the idea to a different network  oh yeah right  like anybodys ever gonna do this  how did you get me to go with that  a show about nothing  it was a good idea susan liked it  and if he hadnt vomited all over her wed be writing it right now  what are you doing  whats wrong with you what are you doing give me that  go to your apartment and lie down ill make an appointment for a doctor  hello oh hi im sorry  no thats my neighbor hes not quite himself  he got kicked in the head  what really youre kidding  today yeah sure we could make it two oclock  yeah we could do that  okay great thanks a million  okay bye   what  nbc  they wanna have another meeting  they wanna have another meeting  they wanna buy it they wanna buy it what did i tell you  well be rich what are we gonna get   fifty 60 thousand  i dont know about 60  oh its gotta be 50  you know how much ted danson makes  ted danson now how are you comparing us to ted danson   i didnt say were ted danson  you did you said were ted danson   you know i think he wears a piece  yeah dont worry he can

got an appointment go to your appointment   im sorry really  you know  i know plenty of people in hollywood too  sorry really   yeah  come on are you ready lets go   for what  whats with you  i just talked to you 15 minutes ago   about what  the courthouse  you gotta go with me to court im contesting the ticket   i cant im going to the doctors later  you gotta go  youre my alibi you have to take the stand   well i cant  well let me remind you of something  you wouldnt even be here today if it wasnt for me and my helmet  i saved your life you would be dead  you would cease to exist youd be gone for the rest of eternity  can you even begin to comprehend what that means  shut up  ill get my coat  dont step on anything  there are many things that i think you can point to  as proof that the humans are not smart  but my personal favorite would have to be that we had to invent the helmet  what happened was we were involved  in a lot of activities that were cracking our heads  we chose not to avoid doing these activities but instead  to come up with some sort of device  to help us continue enjoying our headcracking lifestyles  the helmet  not enough people were wearing them  so we had to come up with the helmet law  which is even stupider the idea behind the helmet law  is to preserve a brain whose judgment is so poor  it does not even try to stop the cracking of the head its in  did you see the look on his face did you see how insulted he was  what could i do what are we supposed to do  you cant leave  theres no excuse good enough to justify walking away  from a conversation with one of my relatives  i didnt shave this morning i dont feel like myself  you could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire  you bump into one of my relatives sorry uncle leo  theres a building full of people burning down i do have to be running  hell go go go ahead go to your fancy fire  if thats what you have to do   look at this  why didnt you shave this morning  because i shaved yesterday in the afternoon   why  because of the day before  its a long story  i cant get back on schedule  is that joe davola  its not him  i cant live like this im being stalked  mr seinfeld theyre ready for you  mr seinfeld what about mr costanza  im not here  all right you promised  youre gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea   just a little  all right a little  okay you all set you got your story   no  when he stopped me  i told him i was rushing because my friend was about to commit suicide  now youre that friend  all we need is a reason why you were gonna commit suicide  i never had an air conditioner  no thats no reason to kill yourself  why it gets hot at night you cant sleep  you ever try to sleep in a hot room  i sleep in a really hot room i dont wanna kill myself  ive slept in really hot rooms and i wanted to kill myself  no no thats not gonna work something else  i was never able to become a banker  banker so youre killing yourself  because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled  you you you cant live without being a banker  yeah yeah if i cant be a banker i dont wanna live   you must be a banker  must be a banker  okay well go with the banker story  story is the foundation of all entertainment  you must have a good story otherwise its just masturbation  and people really have to care about the characters  care forget about care love  they have to love them otherwise  why tune in  wouldnt tune in   would they tune in  no tune  we like to look at a show as if it were an ekg  you have your highs and your lows and it goes up and down  this show will be like a heart attack  just a huge massive coronary  so what you said last week about no story  youre a little flexible on that now  is that what i said no story because jerry had to tell me later  he couldnt believe it  i said i said get out of here no story  is that what i said  well i informed him that he was exceeding the speed limit  and thats when he told me that he was racing home  because his friend was about to commit suicide  and then what happened  he became very loud and hysterical  he was flailing his arms about as he told the story  and then he threw himself on the ground  and he grabbed me around the legs  and he begged me to let him go  and when i refused  thats when he began to scream my friends going to die  my friends going to die  i dont know how you guys feel but we would like to be in business with you   we would like to be in business  love to be in business   well do business  business   lets have business  this is business  would it be possible to get a copy of la cocina  your offbroadway play  gee you know  its its the damndest thing l  i moved recently and my files disappeared  now l i dont know if they fell off the truck  or if there was some foul play but let me tell you  i am not through with that moving company  thats my vow to you  well i got a feeling about you two  and even more than that  i place great confidence in this ladys judgment   good judgment  good judgment   thats a pile of judgment  yes yes judgment with earrings on  so lets make a pilot  i had gone up to westchester  i go every tuesday  i do charity work with the blind  in my spare time for the lighthouse  i was in the middle of a game of parcheesi with an old blind man  and i excused myself to call my friend  as he was very depressed lately  because he never became a banker  i dont understand  you see it had been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he  just the day before he was turned down by a bank  i believe it was the manufacturers hanover  on lexington and 40th street  that was the third bank in two weeks to turn him down  so i was i was a little concerned i wanted to see how he was doing  well your honor he was barely audible  but l i distinctly recall him saying  hey yoyo ma  so i sped home to save my friends life and i was stopped for speeding  yes i admit i was speeding  but it was to save a mans life  a close friend  an innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love  to be loved and to be a banker  so then he didnt kill himself  no sir he did not  but only by the grace of god  he is in the courtroom today sitting right over there  and he can corroborate my entire testimony  see told you i told you   now all we gotta do is write it  yes  how are we gonna do that   hey congratulations  thanks   thank you thanks  thank you  you know i thought you were mad at me  mr seinfeld you have a telephone call  phone call who knows im here  hello mom  how did you know i was here  oh i was not rude to him that is baloney  i couldnt talk i had a meeting  i dont know he he went off on some thing about pajamas  when you sent me the bill i thought the show didnt have a chance  oh it was only vomit  anyway i would like to pay for the dry cleaning   oh no no its okay  oh no no no  we all chipped in we have the money  well it was  18   okay  18 there it is there you go  all right  so maybe we could get together this weekend   yeah call me  all right great   bye  bye thanks  bye  i cant believe she took the money  why  i offered to pay she should have said no  she did you insisted  this is what the pilot should be about vomiting on somebodys vest  how much are we gonna get for this   oh l i dont know  we gotta get 50 gotta get 50  well go you call your manager maybe they made an offer   okay  all right lets go lets go  thirteen thousand  thirteen thousand   apiece  no for both  thats insulting ted danson makes 800000 an episode   would you stop with the ted danson  well he does   youre

sandwich now  i thought he was gonna have a muffin  all of a sudden he gets hungry   you know a muffin can be very filling  i know  mr kramer  you heard the testimony so far  would you please tell the court in your own words  what happened on the afternoon of september 10th  what do you mean in my own words  whose words are they gonna be  you know what i mean   i was very upset that day  and why was that   would you let me say let me talk  all right go ahead   all right  okay  i was very upset that day because i could never become a banker  and this failure to become a banker  was eating at you eating eating eating at you inside  yeah  it was your family that pushed you into banking it was their dream for you   mr newman  im trying to establish  mr kramers fragile emotional state my entire case depends on it  continue   as you were saying mr kramer  what was the question  youre telling how your parents pushed you into banking  well my father when i was a kid  he took me to the bank  and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said  sonny boy take a good look at him  thats gonna be you someday  but you never became a banker did you mr kramer  why why did you fail

school every day no matter how he drives  what is his incentive to not speed  hes going to traffic school anyway  why not get a racecar do 200 miles an hour down the street  cop stops you where you going traffic school go ahead  and you better hurry you really need it  the punishment should be instead of traffic school or traffic court just traffic  they sentence you to 100 hours of traffic  five people drive all around you  at five miles an hour wherever you go  youre on your way to vegas there isnt a car in sight  come on move it
