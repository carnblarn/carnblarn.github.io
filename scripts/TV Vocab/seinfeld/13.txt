interesting because no one in my family has their tonsils  and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people  well its like the capulets and the montagues  excuse me  anyway i strongly recommend they come out  what you mean with a knife  yes with a knife you know snip snip  anyway youd be completely under you wouldnt feel a thing  and when you wake up you can have some ice cream  yeah thats

 hes holistic  george hes holistic   holistic  yeah  that sounds right  george you need a medical doctor  let me ask you something  how much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids

unnecessary surgery  can i use hot water on my face  no you know  i am not a businessman  i am a holistic healer its a calling its a gift  you see its in the best interest of the medical profession  that you remain sick see that insures good business  youre not a patient youre a customer  and youre not a doctor but you play one in real life  what about shaving  youre eating too much dairy  may i
