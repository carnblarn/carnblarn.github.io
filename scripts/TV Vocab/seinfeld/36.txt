over  well you might as well look it over  so whats going on how did all this happen  jerry and george called me from this limo  they said were all going to the knicksbulls game  limo  i thought that george went to pick him up  he did  then why would they take a limo from the airport  i dont know  thats pretty strange  did he say anything else  yeah he said its really important  that we call them obrien and murphy  obrien why would he wanna be called obrien  and the jews steal our money  through their zionistoccupied government  and use the black man to bring drugs  into our oppressed white minority communities  youre not gonna open with that are you  what was that you said about the myth of the holocaust  said so many things  theyre shooting theyre shooting  all right get down  im ready to die for you  oh thats really very nice of you eva thank you  but of course you know i would  i would do anything for you  anything  nothing to worry about it was a flat tire  but rest assured  were prepared to handle anything that might come up  nicelooking luger  im at the paramount adjacent to madison square garden  where a growing number of angry demonstrators  gather to protest the first public appearance of donald obrien  leader of the midwestern regional chapter of the aryan union  and reputed to be their most charismatic spokesman  mr obrien advocates the violent overthrow of the government  he has openly professed a deep admiration of adolf hitler  even david duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist  there is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport  sources tell me he is en route and should be arriving momentarily  police have set up barricades but quite frankly bill  i dont think theyre any match for the emotional fuse that has been lit  from the paramount im jodi baskerville back to you in the studio  somethings very strange here  george goes to the airport to pick up jerry  they come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game  and wanna be called obrien and murphy  obrien obrien why obrien  elaine   dan  excuse me a minute hey   hi dan how are you  good   oh this is kramer  oh kramer  whats going on  were headed down

the aryan union   you or me  you are  and who is responsible for making hatemongering  and fascism popular again  you are  okay  i think you forgot something   im sorry  good  now get out   all right

not funny  oh my god  yes yes  what what is it  dont you see theres always been something  very strange about jerry always so clean and organized   so  do i have to spell it out for you  the limo the name  the rally at madison square garden  jerry and obrien are the same person  jerry is the leader of the aryan union  jerrys a nazi  i cant even believe i didnt see it  listen you idiot just calm

may not look like one  but i act like a murphy  hes extremely murphy to a fault  where are you from  dublin originally  parents came over here when i was 18  cereal famine  couldnt get a bowl anywhere it was bad  tis a beautiful country though  lush rolling hills and the peat  the peat  sounds more like scottish  we were right on the border  maybe hes with the company   what  the cia  maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within   what about his comedy act  thats the perfect cover  all that time on the road  look jerry hes too normal to be a comedian  these comedians theyre sick neurotic people   well what about george  what about him hes part of it  his whole personalitys a disguise  theres no real person can act the way he does  elaine im telling you theyre with the organization  theyre all part of it  hes in there with helms and hunt and liddy that whole crowd  george and jerry they probably know who killed kennedy  i bet they were even in on it  all right what are we gonna do what  im not gonna let them hurt you im not gonna  kramer youre hurting me  those are our friends i told you about   get off of me  were gonna talk to them pull over   get off of me  its all right   get off  hey obrien   obrien  is that him   yeah thats him  look theres obrien  nogood nazi bastard   lets get him  get him   what do we do  get in the car   get in the

for me  hello  its obrien  obrien  well thats weird  who are you   im jerry seinfeld  im george costanza  this is a misunderstanding  his car broke down i told him to get  my car started shaking violently about a mile out   so he picks me up without a car  and there was a line  the limo has just pulled up  its being surrounded by a huge crowd of protesters  this has the makings of a very ugly scene  i just didnt have anything to do tonight  then the phone rang and it was jerry  we just wanted a ride into the city  he was supposed to pick me up but he didnt pick me up  and tonight we were gonna go to the basketball game  theyre banging on the car trying to flip it over  the police seem unable or unwilling to control the crowd  i would imagine mr obrien must be having some very grave doubts  if he made the right choice for his first appearance  we did not want to antagonize the nazis  we have no intention of upsetting the nazis   i dont have a problem with nazis  do whatever you want   dont bother us we wont bother you  i dont wanna make a nazi unhappy   i swear i swear  i swear   i swear  i swear   get out  open the door  oh look look its dan   hi dan  elaine   hi dan  come
