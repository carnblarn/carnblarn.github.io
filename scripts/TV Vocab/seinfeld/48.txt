                i think people think of their office as a stationery store with danish  you know what i mean you wanna get your pastry  your envelopes your supplies  your toilet paper six cups of coffee and you go home  why do people that work in offices  have pictures of their family on their desk facing them  do they forget that theyre married  do they go 500 time to hit the bars and pick up hookers  hold it a second  i got a wife and three kids i better get home  i completely forgot   she hasnt told her father yet  were supposed to tell him tonight   what do you mean were  susan wants me to be there  youre meeting the father for the first time   yeah  youll make quite an impression  when you tell him how you burned his cabin down  i didnt burn it down kramer did  i mean the whole thing is ironic think of it  the guys nice enough to give you a box of very fine cuban cigars   i know what happened  no wait   then you dump them off onto kramer  i know  who proceeds to burn the mans cabin down  with one of those very same cigars  its very comical  maybe we shouldnt start writing today  i got a lot on my mind  weve put this off long enough todays the day  i wonder how susans fathers gonna react  whats the worst he can do so you burn a house down  come on  not even a house its like a cabin  we could build a cabin like that  well maybe not us but two men could  bics what did you get bics  what you got a problem with the pen now  i like a rolling writer theyre smooth  all right lets just get to work  nbc pilot seinfeld project  act 1 scene a  so youre gonna sit there  let me explain to you  one of the key elements involved in the writing process  because it may seem outwardly  that the pen and the paper and the chair play a large role  but theyre all somewhat incidental to the actual using of the brain  okay so just just park yourself  all right act 1 scene a   drink  no no drink   all right here we go  act 1 scene a   werent you supposed to call elaine  yes  hi is elaine there  oh hi sandra  yeah i can hold  every time i call i gotta chitchat with her assistant for like 20 minutes  oh hi sandra listen im at a pay phone  theres a lot of people waiting to use it  ill be off in a minute  yeah could you put me through to elaine  okay thanks  are you thinking of ideas  is there any way i can get you directly  every time i call sandra bends my ear for like 20 minutes  so were on for later  yeah ill come by after work  hey i got a rubberpencil thing happening here  i gotta go i gotta go  sandra sandra  can you come here for a second   okay lets go

the middle of something   were trying to do a little work here  yeah come on  whats with you   no more golf  why  remember i told you about the pro at the westchester country club  whos letting me play every time i gave him those cuban cigars   yeah  yeah well i lost them all in the fire  hey george maybe you can ask susans father for some more  what are you crazy  i cant ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin  whats one thing got to do with another  kramer please  well i cant go back to the public courses now  i cant i wont  i mean you know what thats like its crowded  the grass has big brown patches in it  they dont rake the sand traps  not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with  i cant help you youre gonna have to get them someplace else  where theyre cubans   you know what i should take off  what  i gotta go to susans parents house for dinner  i wanna shower first and i wanna leave plenty of time  you got four hours what about the script  i think we got a bite on it  doesnt george look like your sister sara  a slight resemblance  her sons a podiatrist you know  oh i have tremendous respect for people who work with feet  i mean to dedicate yourself to the foot  youre toiling in virtual anonymity i mean  how are you enjoying those cigars i gave you  oh the cigars  im sucking them down  im puffing my brains out yeah  you know those cigars are made special for castro  i did not know that  weird wild   what  hes doing johnny carson daddy  i didnt care much for his jokes   daddy never laughs  oh well so what  laughter what is that  i mean what is the point of opening your mouth and going  what is that  you know you cant get those cigars anywhere  you and your cigars  wear some more lipstick  daddy theres theres something that we have to talk to you about  oh i forgot to ask you howd you like the cabin  oh the the cabin  well  after we get off the phone you tell her  of course she knows it was me who complained  now im responsible for this woman quitting   oh this is unbelievable  i know  i screwed up its all my fault   would you call her  oh dial the number  how could you do this  i was just trying to help you  trying to help me  hello sandra  hi this is jerry seinfeld  listen i wanted to tell you theres been a terrible misunderstanding  see i told elaine  that it was a real treat talking to you on the phone  and she thought i was being sarcastic because im a comedian and all  she thought i think yeah its a real treat talking to her on the phone  but i was really being sincere  no of course i like you  tonight  hold on a second   she wants to have a drink with me  just go go   oh i dont  go  yeah i think i can  yeah i know where that is  okay ill see you there okay bye  now i gotta have a drink with her  the cabin  well  susan   about the cabin  i love that place  my father built that cabin in 1947  my mother was recuperating from impetigo at the time  and dad thought it would be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air  she died there the following winter  and dad passed away  his last words to me were  cherish the cabin  not take care of your sister shes a paraplegic  but cherish the cabin  and i have for 45 years  its often been a sanctuary for me  kind of like supermans fortress of solitude  what  superman  he built a fortress of solitude up at the north pole  to you know sort of get away from it all  when i go im passing it on to her  well ill take a hotel any day   daddy  yes  daddy about the cabin  look henry i spilled wine on me   what about it  well the thing is   what what is it  well the cabin is kind of   george  burned   burned  there was a fire and it  burned   the cabin burned  yeah burned  burned  was anything found  was it all burned to the ground did they find anything   no nothing  nothing  but you know mr ross if you look at the whole situation  what with it being your cigars and everything  its really rather ironic  one might even say in a sense comical  really think about it   i cant believe you said that  what  how could you say something like that to me  what you were the one who was talking dirty  i was just trying to keep up   that was a weird thing to say  why it didnt mean anything  i was trying to join in so you wouldnt feel embarrassed   oh i think youre really sick  im not sick  you said much sicker things than me   im leaving  youre making too much of this  excuse me   let me walk you to a cab  thats okay  the main thing is that this is just between us   and thatll be the end of it  oh really  i mean people theyre not interested in things like this  they dont wanna hear about it they really dont  so were drinking and talking  and so she starts rubbing my leg  wow what did you do  have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg   yeah right  i know its the wrong thing to do  she works in elaines office but i cant get that hand off my leg  im looking at the hand thinking that hand should not be on my leg  but i cant make my brain to get my mouth to say the words  would you mind  yet women have no problem getting the hand off how do they do that  i dont know theyre working on a whole other level   all right so go ahead  so then we go back to my apartment  so were fooling around there  you know its getting a little passionate  and she starts with the dirty talking  all right all right hold on  time out   what did she say  you know the usual  no i dont know how do i know the usual   typical things  whats typical give me typical  she says  thats very dirty  thats absolutely filthy  and then she starts talking about her panties  im gonna need some water here  so i said something  okay what did you say  now bear in mind i am just trying to keep up   of course  okay  so shes talking about her panties  so  so i said  you mean the panties your mother laid out for you  the panties your mother laid out for you   what does that mean  i dont know  it just popped out   well how did she react  she flipped out just left  well thats not offensive  its abnormal but its not offensive  look the main thing is i dont want elaine to know about any of this  i mean especially the pantie remark  i mean its embarrassing shed never let me hear the end of it  what if this girl says something  she will shes going back to work  i talked her into it how stupid was that  so susans father took that news pretty hard huh  yeah he went into the bedroom and started sobbing   guess he didnt see the humor in it  yeah   lets go we got a lot of work to do  all right   big workday  thats right   okay  lets go
