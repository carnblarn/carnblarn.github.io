theyre always a little bit ahead  can i get in over there  can i get ahead of you  yeah come on over here pal were zooming over here  this is the secret lane nobody knows about it  the ultimate i think the ultimate psychological test of traffic  is the total dead stop not even rolling  and you look out the window you see gum clearly  but we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that  what will happen will it start moving backwards is that possible  that someday well be going  boy this is some really bad traffic now  this is really bad  im gonna try and get off and get back on going the other way   she cant kill me right  no of course not   people break up all the time  every day  it just didnt work out what can i do  i wanted to love her i tried to love her i couldnt  you tried  id be looking at her face id go  come on love her love her   did you tell her you loved her  i had no choice  she squeezed it out of me  shed tell me she loved me all right so at first id just look at her  id go oh really  or  boy thats thats something  but eventually you have to come back with  well i love you you know you can only hold out for so long   youre a human being  i didnt even ask her out  she asked me out first she called me up  what was i supposed to do say no i cant do that to someone   youre too nice a guy  i am im a nice guy  and then she seduced me  were in my apartment im on the couch shes on the chair  i get up to go to the bathroom i come back  shes on the couch  what am i supposed to do not do anything  i couldnt i wouldve insulted her   youre flesh and blood  i had nothing to do with any of this  i met all her friends  i didnt want to meet them i kept trying to avoid it  i knew it would only get me in deeper  but they were everywhere they kept popping up all over the place  this is nancy susan amy my cousin my brother my father   its like im in quicksand here  i told you when i met her  my back is killing me  you gotta go to my chiropractor hes the best   everybodys guy is the best  ill make an appointment for you   well go together  please they dont do anything  do i have to break up with her in person cant i do it over the phone   i have no stomach for these things  do it like a bandaid  one motion right off   hi  hi   what are you doing  im letting you in  no i dont want to sit in back ill be left out of the conversation   no you wont  yes i will george  ill have to stick my chin on top of the seat   okay  why cant you sit in the middle  please it doesnt look good boy boy girl  i think youre afraid to sit next to a man  youre a little homophobic arent you  is it that obvious   hello jerry  hello   did you get a haircut  nope shower  so where are we eating  tell me if you think this is strange theres this guy  who lives in my building who i was introduced to a couple years ago  hes a teacher or something  anyway after we met whenever wed run into each other in the street  or in the lobby or whatever  we would stop and chat a little bit nothing much little pleasantries  hes a nice guy hes got a family  then after a while i noticed there was  no more stopping just saying hello and continuing on our way  and then the verbal hellos stopped  and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition  so fine i figure thats where this relationship is finally gonna settle  polite nodding  then one day  he doesnt nod  like i dont exist  he went from nods to nothing  now theres this intense animosity whenever we pass  i mean its like we really hate each other its based on nothing  a relationship is an organism  you created this thing  and then you starved it so it turned against you  same thing happened in the blob  i think you absolutely have to say something to this guy confront him   really  yes   would you do that  lf i was a different person  hello  hello is glen there  im sorry is this 8055553234  yes i know i have the wrong number i want to know if i dialled wrong or  why do people do that  come on up  oh its you again see  if youd answered me i wouldnt have had to do this  thats two longdistance calls ive made to you why cant you  why why do they just hang up like that  thank you very much   taste this  no i just had a sandwich   no taste it  i dont want cantaloupe now   you never had it like this before  i only eat cantaloupe   jerry this is great cantaloupe  all right   its very good its good  its good huh  i got it at joes 49 cents a pound  thats practically half than what you pay at the supermarket  i dont know why you dont go to joes  its too far  its three blocks further you could use my shopping cart  im not pulling a shopping cart  am i supposed to wear a kerchief  put stockings on rolled below my knee  the other thing is if you dont like anything  he takes it back  i dont return fruit  fruits a gamble  i know that going in  i did it its over   you did it what happened  i told her in the kitchen  which was risky because its near all the knives  i started with the word  listen i said   listen marlene the next thing i know im in the middle of it  theres this voice inside me going youre doing it  then she started to cry and i weakened a little bit  i almost relented but the voice jerry the voice said   keep going keep going youre almost out  its like i was making a prison break  im heading for the wall  and i trip and twist my ankle and they throw that light on you you know  somehow i get through the crying and i keep running  then the cursing started  shes firing at me from the guard towers  son of a bang son of a boom  i get to the top of the wall the front door  i open it up im one foot away  i take one last look around the penitentiary and i jump  see never as bad as you imagine  i like that marlene  whats her number  yeah no l i dont think so  could you stop that smacking  george i want you to taste this cantaloupe   no thank you  its the best cantaloupe ive had   no really  ill get you a piece   jerry tell him how good it is  very good cantaloupe  so thats it youre out  except for one small problem  i left some books in her apartment  so go get them  no i cant go back there jerry its so awkward  it could be dangerous sexually something could happen  id be right back where i started from  so forget about the books   did you read them  well yeah  what do you need them for  i dont know theyre books  what is this obsession people have with books  they put them in their houses like theyre trophies  what do you need it for after you read it  theyre my books  so you want me to get the books is that it  so it must have been 95 degrees that night  and everyones standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands  i was wearing my old jeans and tshirt  i dont know i was just in one of those moods  so i said to myself  marlene just do it and i jumped in  as im getting out i feel all these eyes on me  so i look up and everyone is just staring at me  so what did you do  well nothing its no skin off my hide if people like to look  i just didnt see what the big attraction was  well i have a general idea what it was  i could take a guess  hey you know jerry  just because george and i dont see each other  doesnt mean we shouldnt stay friends  no  good enough im really glad we got that settled  great  i dont know how this happened  jerry its not my fault  no its not your fault   books books i need my books  have you reread those books yet by the way  the great thing when you read moby dick the second time  ahab and the whale become good friends  its not like marlenes a bad person or anything  but my god weve had three lunches and a movie  and she never stops calling  and its those meaningless purposeless blather calls  she never asks if im busy or anything  i just pick up the phone and shes in the middle of a sentence  its standard  has she left you a message  where she uses up the whole machine  you know sometimes shell go  hello jerry  and ill go oh hi marlene  and then its jerry  i dont know sometimes   know sometimes  what about trying to get off the phone  you cant its impossible  theres no break in the conversation where you can go  all right then  you know it just goes on and on without a break in the wall  i mean ive gotta put a stop to this  just do it like a bandaid one motion right off  she is sexy though   dont you think  yeah  yeah she is   mr costanza  yeah  the doctor will see you now  yeah  doctor  im gonna have to wait in that little room all by myself arent i  i better take this  i hate the little room  oh hello doctor  waiting room i hate when they make you wait in the room  because it says waiting room  theres no chance of not waiting  because they call it the waiting room theyre gonna use it  its all set up for you to wait  you sit there and you got your little magazine  you pretend you read it but youre really looking at other people  you know youre thinking about them things like   i wonder what hes got  and soon as she goes im getting her magazine  then they finally call you and its a very exciting moment  they finally call you  you stand up and kind of look around at the other people  well i guess ive been chosen  ill see you all later  you think youre gonna see the doctor but youre not are you no  youre going into the next waiting room  the littler waiting room  but if they are doing some sort of medical thing to you  you want to be in the smallest room that they have i think  you dont want to be in the largest room that they have  you ever see these operating theatres that they have  with like stadium seating  you dont want them doing anything  that makes other doctors go  i have to see this  are you kidding are they gonna really do that to him  are there seats can we get in  do they scalp tickets to these things   i got two for the winslow tumour i got two  so how was it  i was in there for two minutes he didnt do anything  touch this feel that 7 5 bucks  well its a first visit  whats 7 5

airplane lamp  you have the slowest elevator in the entire city  thats hard to get used to when youre on so many fast ones  apartment elevators are always slower than offices  because you dont have to

you know what they say lucky in love unlucky with fruit  well im taking this back  so i had what you might call a little encounter this morning  really that guy who stopped saying hello   yes  you talk to him  yes i spotted him getting his mail  at first i was just gonna walk on by but then i thought  no no   do not be afraid of this man  right  so i walked up behind him tapped him on the shoulder and said   hi remember me  and he furrows his brow  as if hes really trying to figure it out  so i said to him i said you little phoney  you know exactly who i am   you said you little phoney  i did i most certainly did  and he goes oh yeah youre jeanettes friend we did meet once  i said  how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person  when they walk by  this is amazing  and he says  look i just didnt want to say hello anymore all right  and i said  fine i didnt want to say hello anymore either  but i just wanted you to know that im aware of it  you are the queen of confrontation  youre my new hero  youve inspired me im gonna call george about something right now  this cantaloupe stinks  i dont care   youre kidding  no i dont care   you mean that  absolutely   you dont care  no

with anything  well to be honest  it just didnt make it for me  its just so much fluff  i cant believe this  what are you saying you didnt like my act  so thats it  i cant be with someone if i dont respect what they do  youre a cashier  look jerry it just wasnt my kind of humour  you cant go by the audience it was late they were terrible  i heard the material  i have other stuff  you should come

we have   right now im the regional management supervisor  im in development research consulting  men on the other hand if they are physically attracted to a woman  are not that concerned with her job are we  men dont really care  men just go  really slaughterhouse that where you work interesting  you got a big cleaver just lopping their heads off sounds great  listen why dont you shower up  and well get some burgers and catch a movie
