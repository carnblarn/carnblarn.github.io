you called   and described someone you think they would know who it was  whats the matter you need a lawyer  i met someone i know where she works but i dont know her name  why dont you ask someone who was at the party  no the only one i could ask is elaine i cant ask her   why not  because its complicated  theres some tension there  he used to go with her   which one is she  from maryland  she brought the chocolatecovered cherries you didnt like  oh yeah very alert warm person  oh yeah shes great  so how come nothing materialized there  well its a tough thing to talk about   i dont know  i know what it was  you dont know what it was  so what was it  well we fight a lot for some reason   oh well  oh well  and there was a little problem with the physical chemistry  well i think shes a very attractive girl  she is she absolutely is  i can see if there was a weight problem  no its not that  it wasnt all onesided  you know you cant be so particular nobodys perfect   i know i know  you

i guess  so you stand in the lobby   by the elevator and wait for her to come down for lunch  you mean stake out the lobby  morty thats ridiculous just ask elaine for the number  he doesnt want to ask elaine for the number  so you got him standing by the elevator like a dope   what happens when he sees her  he pretends he bumped into her  you know what this is not that bad an idea   what does she

dont think so  well what does he do is he an artisan   a craftsman a labourer of some sort   wall street  high finance  bulls bears people from connecticut  and he happens to be pretty goodlooking  all right sir  and hes hilarious   now thats not fair  you know  so where did you meet this guy  i staked out his health club  when youre on a stakeout   do you find its better to stand up against the wall   or kind of crouch down behind a big plant  you know i think that   even if youve had a relationship with someone   or lets say especially if youve had a relationship with someone   and you try and become friends afterwards   its very difficult isnt this  its hard because you know each other so well  you know you know all each others tricks  its like two magicians trying to entertain each other  you know one goes look a rabbit  the other goes so  i believe thats your card   look why dont we just saw each other in half and call it a night okay  adapted by ninjaw pb
