side   well whose side are you taking  well im not taking your side  kirk douglas now theres another very bad driver  but hes such an unbelievable guy  when he hits someone he doesnt leave a note  he sits in his car and waits for the other person  so he can exchange license registration and apologize  i said god bless you was that so wrong  the question is  did you allow a space  for the husband to come in with his god bless you  because as the husband he has the right of first refusal   yeah  its me   come on up  yes  yes i definitely waited  but let me say this  once he passes on that option  that god bless you is up for grabs  no argument unless shes one of these multiple sneezers  and hes holding his god bless you in abeyance  until she completes the series  i dont think she is a multiple sneezer  because she sneezed again later and it was also a single  what if shes having an off night   hi  hi  well  if it isnt mr gesundheit  oh yeah like theres something wrong  with saying god bless you  i was raised to say god bless you  shut up  what does it mean anyway god bless you  its a stupid stuperstition  a stupid what  whatever  you wanna make a person feel better you shouldnt
