humiliated  im sure it wasnt at you  well then what was she laughing at  pez no thank you  did you see her  me no l  anyone who would laugh at a recital  is probably some sort of lunatic anyway  i mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant  well you know maybe some mental defective  put something stupid on her leg  even if this socalled mental defective did put something on her leg  shes still the one who laughed  ill never forget that laugh for the rest of my life  im sure she would apologize if she could  probably someone is holding her back  maybe against every fiber

fine thats fine thats good  okay okeydoke  you know i think kramer might have been indirectly responsible  for getting richie involved in drugs  what how  a few years ago the comedy club had a softball team  kramer was our first baseman  you couldnt get anything by him he was unbelievable  anyway this one game we came back to win from like eight runs behind  so kramer says to richie  why dont you dump the bucket of gatorade on marty bensons head  the club owner yeah  so richie goes ahead and does it  so what happened what happened  the guy was like 67 years old it was freezing out  he caught a cold developed pneumonia a month later  he was dead shut up  all the comedians were happy  because hes one of these club owners nobody liked  but richie was never the same  what about kramer hes the same  are you sure you want me john  i mean i havent spoken to richie in two years  i dont have a good apartment for an intervention  the furniture its very nonconfrontational  all right all right goodbye  remember richie appel  oh sure the guy i told to pour the gatorade that killed marty benson  right john mollica is organizing some kind of intervention for him  were having it here  can i get in on that  what do you think its like a poker game  ls elaine going yeah  well i knew him as well as she did  yeah but john invited her  so wait you dont want me to intervene  no intervene go ahead intervene all you want  im just afraid you might be interfering while were intervening  yeah its george  come on up  stop smelling your arm  you know i got a great idea for a cologne  its called the beach  you spray it on and its just like you came home from the beach  a cologne that smells like the beach  i cant believe im saying this but thats not a bad idea  tell me about it  why dont you call steve dgiff  he works in the marketing department at calvin klein  in fact hes a good friend of john mollica and richie also  okay  well its over its definitely over  she broke up with you no but shes going to  i can sense it we had this terrible phone conversation  i was so nervous before i called i made a list of things to talk about  what was on the list  lets see  im very good at going in reverse in my car  why isnt postum a more popular drink  yeah postum is underrated  anyway there was all this tension  i asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner  and she said no maybe we could have lunch  you know what that means whats wrong with lunch  lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner  you dont go back to lunch its like being demoted  ill never do a crossword puzzle with her again i know it  i like the jumble you ever do the jumble  i have no power you understand  i need hand i have no hand  why dont you break up with her what  break up with her you reverse everything that way  a preemptive breakup  a preemptive breakup  this is an incredible idea yeah  i got nothing to lose  we either break up which she would do anyway  but i go out with some dignity  or i completely turn the tables  this is absolutely brilliant  so im afraid l  am gonna have to break up with you  youre breaking up with me yes  i  am breaking up with you  wow shocked  i really am never expected this did you  i thought everything was fine well live and learn  well i dont understand you didnt enjoy being with me  didnt we have fun doing the crossword puzzle  kind of  im very confused well i didnt mean to hurt you kid  i thought now stop it please  what do you want i know i can make you happy  when youre playing the piano  do you think about me  i dont know this is what im talking about  okay ill think about you  all the time all the time  you know okay all the time  i cant hear you all the time  see its not so hard  go ahead smell smell it  yeah so now you recognize it  i dont know  the beach  what are you talking about oh im talking about the beach  what about it  you know the way you smell  when you first come home from the beach  well i want to make a cologne that captures  the essence of that smell  oh yeah  that is the dumbest idea ive ever heard  whoa wait a minute you  did you hear what i just said  you think people are gonna pay 80 a bottle  to smell like dead fish and seaweed  thats why people take showers when they come home from the beach  its an objectionable offensive odor  so you dont think that its a good idea  the membranes get dry and it just starts bleeding  since i was a kid so i have to stick a tissue up there  you have to work like that  yeah nobody minds  nobodys ever said anything to me  there any ice cubes whatevers in the freezer  i looked i dont see any ice cubes  well then i guess theres no ice cubes  i cant drink this its warm  john shouldnt we rehearse this  before richie comes whats the plan  do i have to

elaine hi  hi noel  well youre looking well  jerry let me tell you something  a man without hand is not a man  ive got so much hand im coming out my gloves  i got to thank kramer  even if i were dragged through manure  i still wouldnt put that stuff on  this man is a genius a genius  you think so i dont think so i know so  come here i gotta talk to you  the male kangaroo doesnt have a pouch  only the female has it  so the male has pouch envy  why should she have this huge pouch and i have nothing  i have things to carry too  at least give me a pocket  that laugh thats the laugh  thats it youre the one no no  no it was an accident it wasnt my fault it was jerry  jerry put a pez dispenser on my leg  you put a pez dispenser on her leg during my recital  i didnt know she would laugh and

hey richie  so whats going on  so we start the intervention and its pretty ugly from the getgo  hes not listening hes hostile hes talking back  i cant do these puzzles  so he starts to get up  suddenly he spots the pez dispenser on the coffee table  the pez dispenser  he picks it up hes staring at it  its like hes hypnotized by it  then hes telling us this story about how when he was a kid  he was in the car with his father  and his father was trying to load one of them  well theyre hard to load tell me something i dont know  so as the fathers trying to load it he loses control of the car  crashes into a high school cafeteria  get out nobodys hurt  but pez was all over the car  and the dispenser was destroyed  virtually beyond recognition  poor kid so as hes telling the story  he starts crying  what did you do what do you think  i gave him my pez dispenser wow  two hours later he checks into smithers clinic  talked to the doctor yesterday hes doing great on the rehab  hes hooked on pez  hes eating them like theres no tomorrow  whats a threeletter word for candy  i cant do those things  jawbreakers to me was like the ultimate challenge candy  it was like candy manufacturers were sitting in their laboratories going  l wonder if theyll eat this  this seems pretty tough to eat  lets market it as some sort of experiment  but the concept of jawbreakers what was the concept  multicolored cement balls for a quarter  was that the idea behind it  lets see if we can hurt them  lets see if theyll pay to be hurt  this is the idea behind jawbreakers  i did it i ate them i loved them  oh this is very painful im really hurting  and this is hurting me a lot i love them
