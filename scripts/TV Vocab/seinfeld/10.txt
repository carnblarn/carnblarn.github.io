                well i painted my apartment again ive been living there for years  every time i paint it it gets me down  i look around and i think well its a little bit smaller now  its the thickness of the paint but im aware of it  it just keeps coming in and coming in  every time i paint it its closer and closer  i dont know where the wall outlets are  i just look for a lump with two slots in it  looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side  thats where i plug in  my idea of the perfect living room  would be the bridge on the starship enterprise  you know what i mean big chair nice screen remote control  thats why star trek really was the ultimate male fantasy  just hurtling through space in your living room watching tv  the aliens were always dropping in  because kirk was the only one that had the big screen  theyd come over friday nights klingon boxing got to be there   what did you do  mousse i moussed up   i guess it was just a matter of time  i shouldve done this years ago  i mean i feel like ive had two lives  my premousse and now i begin my postmousse  tell me the truth have you ever seen a betterlooking guy  looks is so subjective  i dont mean to interrupt or anything  but on sunday my friend is having a brunch for the new york marathon  oh god i keep forgetting to enter that  she lives right above first avenue has a perfect view of the race

right upstairs   right upstairs  right above you  right above me  were neighbours ill be here all the time  all the time  we can exchange keys so we can come in and out  oh this is gonna be great  all the time  the problem with talking is nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing  i think life would be a lot better  if it was like youre always making a movie  you mess up somebody just walks on the set and stops the whole shot  think of the things you wish you could take back  youre out somewhere with people gee you look pregnant are you   cut cut cut  thats not gonna work at all  walk out the door come back in lets take this whole scene again  people think about what youre saying  thanks see you later donna   what happened  you cant believe what i did   what did you do  i could tell you  but you wont believe it its not believable   how could i have done that  done what  i told elaine about an apartment opening up in my building   shes going to move in  elaines moving into your building   yes right above me  right above you   youre gonna be neighbours  i know neighbours   shes right above you  right above me   how could you do that  because im an idiot  you think youre an idiot but with all due respect  lm a much bigger idiot than you are  dont insult me my friend remember who youre talking to  no ones a bigger idiot than me  ever ask an exgirlfriend to move into your building  ever go to a singles weekend in the poconos  shes right in my building right above me  every time i come in ill have to sneak around like a cat burglar  youre doomed youll have all your sex at womens apartments  itll be a permanent road trip forget about the homebed advantage   but i need the homebed advantage  of course we all do   come in for two minutes sit with me  i was just in there its embarrassing  oh whos gonna know   they all saw me walk out  two minutes  my censoring system broke down  you know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say  he went for a cup of coffee and in that second ruined my life  my censor quit two years ago  checked into a clinic emotionally exhausted  so is there any way out of this elaine thing  tough  water pressures terrible in my building she loves a good shower  never heard of anyone turning down an apartment because of weak showers  if they were fanatic about showers they might  for that rent shed take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to  look at this woman feeding her baby  greasy disgusting coffeeshop corned beef hash  isnt that child abuse  id like to have a kid  of course you have to have a date first  remember my friend adam from detroit   yeah the guy with the flat head  hes a cube  anyway he got married about six months ago  ever since hes worn a wedding band  women have been coming on to him everywhere   ive heard that about wedding bands  i wonder if thats really true  thatd be an interesting sociological experiment  you know kramer has his fathers band hed loan it to you  hey thanks a lot ill give it back in a week  i dont know why youre fooling around with this ring  ive been telling you get yourself some plugs  or a piece  im not doing that  oh man you know youre crazy youre a goodlooking guy  what do you want to walk around like that for  no ill put a half a can of mousse in my head like you  i told you i dont like these sponges theyre too small  i want a big sponge  you cant pick up anything theres no absorption  boys boys  hi jerry  hello jerry  okay  okay  your friend cant have the apartment jerry   what  because somebody offered manny  5000 for the apartment  i dont want to do it manny wants to do it  because its true why shouldnt i tell him  hey hey i understand youre businessmen  okay okay  now he says that if your friend has 5000 well give it to her  thats a lot of money  but if thats the way its gotta be thats the way its gotta be  you know i used to think that the universe  is a random chaotic sequence of meaningless events  but i see now that there is reason and purpose to all things  what happened to you  religion my friend thats what happened to me  because i have just been informed that its going to cost elaine  the sum of 5000 to get the apartment upstairs  five thousand dollars she doesnt have 5000   of course she doesnt  so she cant get the apartment   cant get it  she doesnt move in  no move  so you see its all part of a divine plan  and how does the baldness fit into that plan   elaine  yeah  all right  this is gonna require some great acting now  i have to pretend im disappointed  so youll see me really being a phoney i hope you can take this  you should go in the other room  are you kidding i lie every second of the day  my whole life is a sham   because i love elaine  of course you do  but you know not in the building  really i feel terrible about this my intentions were good  what can i do tell me  no ill be seeing you  have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt that its great to be alive  that every breath is a gift of sweet life from above  before i forget  i have the checks for the first month last month security deposit  i have 7 5 left in my account  well theres a little bit of a problem  oh i know theres a weak shower spray  ive already thought about it i am switching to baths  winston churchill said why stand when you can sit  maybe ill get some rubber duckies  no someone offered harold and manny 5000 for the apartment  theyd just as soon give it to you  but you would have to come up with that money  five thousand dollars   i dont have 5000  i know  how am i gonna get 5000  i have no idea  hey my new neighbour  im not moving in   what  they want 5000 now  so okay whats the problem  i dont have 5000  oh come on you can come up with 5000  jerry you dont have 5000 you can lend her  come on  yeah well i didnt i mean  is that something you want to borrow  no thats too much money to borrow  loan her the money you can afford it  she doesnt want to borrow the money  oh come on shell pay you back whats 5 grand between friends   of course id pay you back  yeah  so whats the problem   who said theres a problem  see   he said hed loan you the money  well now jerry  it might take a while for me to pay you back  maybe a few years how do you feel about that  its okay he doesnt care  you know money can sometimes come between friends   get out of here  well let me think about it   whats there to think about  i dont know five thousand  let me just take one more look at it  it was all over  taken care of done finished  five thousand where was she gonna get 5000 she doesnt have

5000 for  well look maybe she wont take it  she did say that she was gonna think about it  people dont turn down money its what separates us from the animals  yeah well i dont understand what the problem is having her in the building  let me explain something to you  you see  youre not normal  youre a great guy i love you but youre a pod  l on the other hand am a human being  i sometimes feel awkward uncomfortable  even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings   you wouldnt understand  yeah because im a pod  ill take it  no   hi elaine  oh hi roxanne  nice to be here

for bald guys with glasses  hey everybody here come the runners  oh excuse me  so you and roxanne are hitting it off huh   i wouldnt quite say that  really  from a distance you seemed to be coming on to her  oh im a guy it always looks like that  because i was thinking  are you at all concerned that living in the same building  will you know cramp our styles  because i was worried that there might be a situation  in which one of us came home with somebody  it could get a little uncomfortable  but as long as youre okay with it its fine with me  ive never been able to be with just one person  i can however carry on strictly physical relationships  which can last for years and years  its a shame youre married  im not   its just a sociological experiment  please  you have no idea what an idiot is  elaine just gave me a chance to get out and i didnt take it  this is an idiot  is that right  i just threw away a lifetime of guiltfree sex  and floor seats for every sporting event in madison
