                i never really understood  the importance of the conductor  between you and me what the hell is this guy doing  do you really need somebody waving a stick in your face  to play the violin does that really help you out  i could see how we need him at the beginning okay  tap tap tap  start okay i could see how you need that  but once were going okay once its all happening  what do we need him for then  i dont see the cellist looking up im confused i dont know what to do  then the conductor go do this like this  oh okay thank you thank you very much  why even try anymore theres no sense to it  im never gonna meet anybody i should accept it  oh yes you will no i wont  yeah maybe you wont  its hard enough to meet a woman you dislike much less like  are my nostrils getting bigger no  see why must it be so difficult why all this tension and hostility  why cant i just walk up to a woman and say hi im george  how are you is that so terrible  h h hi  hi hi  theres just no men out there i know  i mean the problem is that the good ones know theyre good  they know theyre in such demand  theyre not interested in confining themselves to one person  i hate the good ones  is jerry a good one  thats a good question i think he thinks he is  the mediocre ones are available  but so insecure not being a good one  theyre always im not good enough for you  what are you doing with me eventually i just go youre right  you know maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre  no maybe i need somebody who has nothing  somebody who just has to appreciates being with me because hes so desperate  its gotten to the point where im flirting with operators on the phone  i almost made a date with one  oh so theres still hope  i dont want hope hope is killing me  my dream is to become hopeless  when youre hopeless dont care  when you dont care that indifference makes you attractive  so hopelessness is the key its my only hope  you see i wouldnt really mind so much  but i feel badly for my mother  if my mother werent around it wouldnt be so bad  but im telling you if im not married by the time im 40 im gonna have to have to kill her  because its the only fair thing to do  i just couldnt put her through that  at least youre not bitter  who says im not bitter  arent you too young to be bitter no you can be young and bitter  just maybe not as bitter as ill be  but im bitter  anyway dont tell anyone  dont worry your bitterness is safe with me  okay order me a piece of cake  im gonna go throw up  look at my hands  look  filthy from the paper  they should give you a wetnap when you buy one like at those rib joints  what did you do last night went out with george you  went out with cynthia  how was it what did you talk about  oh you know the usual the federal reserve the rain forest  cynthia felt we should nuke the rain forest  get rid of it in one fell swoop so we could eliminate it  as a subject of conversation  what about you we brushed on that  actually george was in rare form  he just cant find anybody  i know cynthia too  shes really given up george too  yeah right yeah right  ive never fixed anybody up ugh me neither  and i am not about to start with george  well why wouldnt you start with george  you think shes too good for george  i didnt say too good did l say too good  you implied it i didnt say it  because if you think shes too good for george  you are dead wrong dead wrong  who is she  who is he hes george  shes cynthia so what  what you dont think shes beautiful  whats with the eyebrows  you know what your problem is your standards are too high  i went out with you  thats because my standards are too low  and by the way women kill for eyebrows like that  do you know that women pluck their real eyebrows  out of their head one by one  until theyre bald jerry bald above the eyes  and then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that  well let me tell you something about george  he is fast  he can run like the wind  and hes strong  ive seen him lift 100 pounds over his head without even knowing it  you wouldnt know it to look at him but george can bait a hook  he can really do that come on lets do it  i think
