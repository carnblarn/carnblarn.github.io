second cousin  i mean i met them three times in my life  i dont know her either  she made me fly from florida for this and then she criticizes my jacket  at least come and say hello have a cup of coffee then you leave  how come he gets to leave  if i wind up sitting next to uncle leo i am leaving  hes always grabbing my arm when he talks to me  i guess because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation  and its always about jeffrey right  yeah he talks about him like he split the atom  the kid works for the parks department   morty you coming in  oh yeah i forgot all about it   hey howd you do  we won   were in the finals on wednesday  yeah  what is this about  im completely changing the configuration of the apartment  youre not gonna believe it when you see it whole new lifestyle   what are you doing  levels   levels  yeah  im getting rid of all my furniture all of it  and im gonna build these different levels  you know with steps  and itll all be carpeted  with a lot of pillows  you know like ancient egypt   you drew up plans for this  no no its all in my head  i dont see how you can get comfortable  oh ill get comfortable  when do you intend to do this  should be done by the end of the month   gonna do this yourself  its a simple job   well you dont think i can huh  no its not that i dont think you can  i know that you cant and im positive that you wont  well i got the tools i got the pillows all i need is the lumber   hey thats some big job  i dont see it happening  yeah well this time this time youre wrong   come on ill even bet you  seriously  i dont want you betting morty dont let them bet  a big dinner with dessert but i got till the end of the month   ill give you a year  no no   no no a month end of the month  its a bet  seriously do you wanna switch chairs  no no im fine  oh jerry you listening to this  yeah uncle leo  so now the parks commissioner is recommending jeffrey for a citation  right for the reducing of the pond scum  no no no for the walking tours  oh yeah where the people eat the plant life the ediblefoliage tour  thats exactly right  he knows the whole history of the park  for two hours hes talking and answering questions  but you wanna know something  whenever he has a problem with a highpowered big shot  from the parks department  you know who he calls  mickey mantle  jerry jerry  did you taste these peas  these peas are great  these peas are bursting with countryfresh flavour  phenomenal peas   are you ready for dessert  well  actually we do have to kind of get going  youre going   i dont really eat dessert im dieting  yeah i cant eat dessert either  the sugar makes my ankles swell up and i cant dance   cant dance  hes kidding manya  is that a joke  so did you hear claires getting married  yeah yeah  i hear the fellow owns a couple racehorses   you know trotters like at yonkers  horses  theyre like big riding dogs  what about ponies huh what kind of abnormal animal is that  and those kids who had their own ponies  oh i know i hated those kids  in fact i hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up  i had a pony  well i didnt really mean a pony per se  when i was a little girl in poland  we all had ponies  my sister had pony  my cousin had pony   so whats wrong with that  nothing nothing at all   i was just merely expressing  should we have some coffee  whos having coffee  he was a beautiful pony and i loved him  well im sure you did who wouldnt love a pony  who wouldnt love a person that had a pony  you you said so  no see we didnt have ponies  im sure at that time in poland they were common they were  probably like compact cars  thats it  i had enough  have your coffee everybody  shes a little upset its been an emotional day  i didnt know she had a pony  how was i to know she had a pony  who figures an immigrant is gonna have a pony  do you know what the odds are on that  i mean in all the pictures i saw of immigrants on boats  coming into new york harbour  i never saw one of them sitting on a pony  but why would anyone come here if they had a pony  who leaves a country packed with ponies to go to a nonpony country  it doesnt make sense  am i wrong   ill drive you to the airport  no were taking a cab  i just hope that whole pony incident didnt put a damper on the trip  oh dont be ridiculous it was a misunderstanding  hey i agree with him  nobody likes a kid with a pony  well if you ever talk to her tell her im sorry elaine too she feels terrible   you know you should call manya  maybe i will   oh hi hey  hey  i just came to say goodbye   hey need any help with those  its nothing i got it  so how are your levels coming along  well i decided im not gonna do it  really what a shock   goodbye well call you  take care   bye jer  bye dad take it easy   bye mr kramer  yeah so long morty  so  when do i get my dinner  theres no dinner the bets off im not gonna do it  yes i know youre not gonna do it thats why i bet  yeah well theres no bet if im not doing it  thats the bet that youre not doing it  yeah i could do it i dont wanna do it  we didnt bet on if you wanted to do it  we bet on if it would be done   and it could be done  well of course it could be done  anything could be done but it only is done if its done  show me the levels   the bet is the levels  i dont want the levels  thats the bet  man  hello  no oh hi  no they just left  oh my god  hang on a second maybe i can still catch them  ma ma up here  dont get in the cab  manya died  manya died   whod you talk to  uncle leo   and whens the funeral  i dont know said hed call back  you know what this means  we lost the supersaver those tickets are nonrefundable  she just had a checkup the doctor said she was fine   unless  what  what nothing  you dont think  what the pony remark  oh dont be ridiculous she was an old woman  you dont think i killed her  you know what that flight will cost us  it was an innocent comment  i didnt know she had a pony  maybe we could get an army transport flight  they got a base in sarasota i think  i mean the whole thing was taken out of context it was a joke  thats probably uncle leo  hello  yes i know  well its just one of those things  sure sure well see you then  the funerals wednesday  wednesday what what wednesday  two oclock wednesday   what  i got a softball game on wednesday  its the championship  so youre not obligated go play in your game   i didnt even know the woman  so dont go  i mean i met her three times i dont even know her last name  jerry no ones forcing you  i mean who has a funeral on a wednesday  thats what i wanna know i mean  this is the championship im hitting everything  i dont have a dress to wear and you you dont have anything  i got my sport jacket  youre not wearing that to a funeral   whats wrong with it  it looks ridiculous  what im gonna buy a new sport jacket now  i dont know what to do  you know what this funerals gonna wind up costing me oh boy  we dont understand death  and the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow  and i mean hey you know  i think if you cant stretch out and get some solid rest at that point  i dont see how bedding accessories really make the difference  i mean they got the guy in a suit with a pillow  now is he going to a meeting or is he catching 40 winks  i mean lets make up our mind where we think theyre going  i actually like ponies  i was just trying to make conversation   what time is your game  245   and what time is the funeral  two oclock  how long does a funeral take  depends on how nice the person was  but you gotta figure even oswald took 45 minutes  so you cant do both  you know if the situation were reversed  and manya had some mahjong championship or something  i wouldnt expect her to go to my funeral i would understand  how can you even consider not going  you know ive been thinking  i cannot envision any circumstance  in which ill ever have the opportunity to have sex again  hows it gonna happen  i just dont see how it could occur  you know funerals always make me think about my own mortality  and how im actually gonna die someday  me dead  imagine that  they always make me take stock of my life  how ive pretty much wasted all of it and how i plan to continue wasting it  i know then you say to yourself   from this moment on im not gonna waste any more of it  but then you go  how  i mean what can i do thats not wasting it  well is this a waste of time what should we be doing   cant you have coffee with people  you know  you know i cant believe youre even considering not playing  we need you youre hitting everything  he has to go he may have killed her  me  what about you you brought up the pony  oh yeah but i didnt say i hated anyone who had one   whos gonna play left field  bender  bender he cant play left he stinks  i just dont see what purpose its gonna serve you going  i mean you think dead people care whos at their funeral  they dont even know theyre having a funeral  its not like shes in the back going  i cant believe jerry didnt show up  maybe shes there in spirit how about that  if youre a spirit and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies  and find out the mysteries of the universe  you think shell be at drexlers funeral home on ocean parkway  george i met this woman she is not travelling to any other dimensions  do you know how easy it is for dead people to travel  its not like getting on a bus one second  its all mental  fifty years they were married now hes moving to phoenix  phoenix whats happening with his apartment  i dont know theyve been in there since like world war ii  rents 300 a month  three hundred a month  oh my god  although this may seem like a sad event  it should not be a day of mourning  for manya had a rich fulfilling life  she grew up in a different world a simpler world  with loving parents a beautiful home in the country  and from what i understand she even had a pony  oh how she loved that pony  even in her declining years whenever she would speak of it  her eyes would light up  its lustrous coat its flowing mane  it was the pride of cracow  well games starting just about now  it was good that the two of you came it was a nice gesture  im not a doctor yet uncle morty im just an intern  i cant write a note to an airline  you got your degree they dont care they just wanna see something   i just wanted to say how sorry i was  jerry  you wanna hear something  your cousin jeffrey is switching parks  theyre transferring him to riverside  so hell completely revamp that operation you understand  yeah  hell do in riverside now what he did in central park  more money  so  thats your cousin  you dont understand ive never paid full fare  once again i just wanted to say how sorry i am  about the other night  oh me too  oh no no no she forgot all about that  she was much more upset about the potato salad  so i understand youre moving to phoenix  yeah my brother lives there  i think manya wouldve liked phoenix  gorgeous exquisite town  so whats happening with your apartment  of course  its very hot there ill have to get an air conditioner  oh you can have mine ill ship it out to you  but what about that big apartment on west end avenue  although they say its a dry heat  dry wet whats happening with your apartment  i dont even know if i should take my winter clothing  i have an idea  leave the winter clothing in the apartment  and ill watch it for you  and ill live there and ill make sure that nothing happens to it  oh the apartment  jeffreys taking the apartment   oh jeffrey  you know jeffrey  yeah from what i understand he works for the parks department   its raining  its raining  its raining  the game will be postponed  well play tomorrow  believe me i wouldnt bother you  if the army hadnt closed that base in sarasota   here scribble a little something here  i cant ill get in trouble  oh for gods sake  who gets picked off in softball   its unheardof  never happened to me before  i remember saying to myself why is jerry so far off the base  ill have to live with this shame for the rest of my life  look then in the fifth inning why did you take off on the pop fly  i thought there were two outs  i couldnt believe it when i saw you running  i thought maybe they had changed the rules or something  it was the single worst moment of my life  what about sharon besser  oh well of course 1 97 3   makes you wonder doesnt it  wonder about what  you know the spirit world  wait you think manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me  i never saw anyone play like that  but i went to the funeral  yeah but that doesnt make up for killing her  maybe manya missed the funeral  because she was off visiting another galaxy that day  dont you think she wouldve heard i was there  not necessarily  who figures an immigrant is gonna have a pony  what is the pony what is the point of the pony  why do we have these animals these ponies  what do we do with them besides the pony ride  well why ponies what are we doing with them  i mean police dont use them for you know crowd control   hey you wanna get back behind the barricades  hey  hey little boy  yeah im talking to you just  behind the barricades  so somebody i assume genetically engineered these ponies  think they could make them any size like the size of a quarter if they want  that would be fun for monopoly wouldnt it have a little pony  and you put him on the   baltic thats two down go ahead hold it there baltic thats  yeah fine right there hold it right there
