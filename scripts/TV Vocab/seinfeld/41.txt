town and she asks me to feed her cat  so at this time theres a lot of stuff going on in my life  and it slips my mind for a few days  maybe a week not even a week five six days  yeah yeah yeah so what happened  well its the damnedest thing  the cat dies  so she comes back she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board   so you killed the cat  thats what she says  i say listen  it was an old cat it died of natural causes  so get this now she tells me that i gotta buy her a brandnew cat  i say listen honey first of all  it was a pretty old cat im not gonna buy you a brandnew cat  to replace an old dying cat  and second of all i go out to the garbage  i find you a new cat in 15 seconds  i say you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation  i spring for a new cat  so she says something to me like i dont know  get the hell out of here and she breaks up with me  now dont you think that would be a great case on la law  i dont wanna tell you how to run your show  no of course not  its enough with the bar already you know what im saying  have they thought about changing the setting  doubt it i doubt it yeah  because people do meet in places besides a bar  well yeah they do  what about a rec room huh  or a community center  you ought to write one of those  ill bring it up with the producers i gotta  fabulous ill think about that george thank you   hows
