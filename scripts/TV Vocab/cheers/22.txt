derek are a little cuter yeah  coach let me ask you a question  youre asking a guy whos taken a lot of fast balls in the head  are you sure you want to ask the question   do you think lm a smart person  the smartest person l ever met  well l diane chambers bred and educated to walk with kings  once offered a full scholarship at the sorbonne  have become attracted to a sixfootthreeinch bubblegum card  l think l can help you with the sore buns diane but  the rest of what you say is all over my head  coach lm making a confession here  not just to you but to myself  maybe lll feel better after l say this  l  l got it  youre hot for sams chilli  l think keats would have said it differently but lll accept that  look if you like sam at all l dont understand what the problem is here  dereks making a commitment  all l ever get from sam is adolescent flirtation  lm not sticking around for that  lf hed give me something anything ld stay  diane you dont understand sam  sams the kind of a guy you know he keeps his feelings to himself  the more he cares about something the less he shows it  lve been with him through his divorce  his boozing the end of his career  and let me tell you the tougher things got the cooler he got  lts a damn sure bet that if hes not expressing himself to you  hes nuts about you  or he couldnt care less  do you mind if l say something  of course not norman  sometimes a man and a woman are so afraid of rejection  that neither will take the first step of admitting their true feelings  norman thats beautiful  l do have a romantic side diane  l know l make a lot of jokes about vera but  the truth is if that woman ever packed her bags and left me  l dont know what ld do first  well l guess l have no choice but to force the issue wheres sam  hes in the office honey  lll tell him lm going away with his brother  lf hes honest and doesnt hide behind that tough jock faade  lll stay  but if he does one of his gratuitous jokes lm leaving   l swear it  wait a minute diane hold on  youre putting your whole future on the line in this one moment  youre letting your whole life turn on this one response   youre right  can it wait till l go to the head  no  lll hear about it  coach what did you do that for  that was our chance to get rid of her once and for all   are you crazy  crazy carla  crazy like a doorknob  hi diane  sam your brother derek has asked me to go to europe with him  so lve come to say goodbye  dammit l didnt need to hear that  whats wrong  lts too late to put a helpwant ad in tomorrows paper  goodbye everyone  lm leaving now lll miss you all very much  bye diane  byebye  sorry honey lm not interviewing till monday  get this straight lm going away with him  good have fun  this could lead to marriage probably will   will lead to marriage  great  well be diane and derek malone  well buy a spread somewhere and call it the doubled  ltll make a nice brand  children well have blonde blueeyed children everywhere   have them brush after every meal  lll be your sisterinlaw  youll come over for dinner and say she sets a good table  had to say something you just fed me  lll send you christmas cards to a wonderful

ecstatic goodbye  see you at the wedding   do l get to kiss the bride  l think you know what you can kiss  this is it everyone l bid you a fond farewell  lve enjoyed knowing you youve brought a lot to my life  bye   goodbye everyone  bye   farewell  get the hell outta here go  l wont let it end this way  lve had warts that went away quicker   what did l hit  my nose youre supposed to knock  you were coming out to say something to me what is it   l wasnt gonna say anything  yes you were what was it   go to the airport  say it  no  what are you doing with that   tell me what you were gonna say  dont do that l hate that  l hate that please stop would you just stop put that down   please dont go  ask me nice   come on  l deserve that much ask me nice  just put it down put the blackboard down  put it down  please stay   why should l  go on get out  lm not sticking around in the hope something will happen between us   what is it you want from me  for you to tell me what you want  lll tell you exactly what l want l want to know what you want  youre doing it again  listen will you just explain one thing to me  lt is very important to me   why arent you with derek  because l like you better  diane listen all the jealousy l felt for my brother over the years  is nothing to what l felt these last five minutes  were about ready to start something that might be great  yeah  maybe we should kiss or something  were not gonna just kiss  were about to start something a kiss is where you start isnt it  you dont make an announcement when you kiss someone  lt wasnt an announcement l didnt want to catch you off guard  on our first kiss its ok to be off guard you should be swept away  l was  nobodys swept away when they say maybe we should kiss  youre right  when l do it l wont say anything  no this isnt right either  l didnt say anything l was swept away  the moments not right were too aware of what were doing  youre right this whole thing is not going the way it should  maybe we should just forget about the kiss and hit the sack  this is the dumbest conversation we have ever had  which means its the dumbest conversation thats ever been  maybe this whole thing is just a mistake   what thing  this thing were trying to do  every time we try to get together it goes wrong  just cos lm a neatlooking guy and youre kinda hungry  hungry  no listen what l mean by that is youve been here a long time  lf it was gonna happen it would have happened by now  lts silly of us to try to make it happen  fine you tell me this now that lve let derek go  dont throw derek in my face you never cared for derek   you just used him to trap me  trap you  lm the best thing to happen to you and youre too stupid to realise it  youre the worst thing that happened to me before you came l was happy  you believe you were happier before you met me  hell yes how do you think it feels  to be attracted to someone that makes you sick  l could write a book on the subject  you cant shut up long enough to write a cheque  you are trying to change the subject  the subject is you cant shut up long enough to kiss me  to save your life l bet you couldnt shut up for 30 seconds   make it ten  l most certainly could   alright lets see  youre going to time me  thats right lm gonna time you ten seconds starting now   this is the most  you want to try again  l wasnt really trying you want to see me do this fine starting now   this is the craziest thing  really good  so l cant do it silence is overrated anyway   at least l have something to say  l dont  the last conversation l had with derek  was about walking on the moors like heathcliff and catherine  and l threw it all away for this  lll tell you what you do why dont you  get out of here go on  take her with you go on get out   dont push me  why dont you just go find derek  fine  shouldnt be hard to find him just follow the applause   maybe l can still catch him  fine  while youre floating around remember this  you are the nuttiest the stupidest  the phoniest fruitcake l ever met  you are the most arrogant selfcentred   shut up shut your fat mouth  make me  make you my god lm gonna bounce you off every wall in this office  try it and youll be walking funny tomorrow  or should l say funnier  l always wanted to pop you one maybe this is my lucky day   you disgust me l hate you  are you as turned on as l am   more  bet me   lm gonna nibble on your ear  dont tell me
