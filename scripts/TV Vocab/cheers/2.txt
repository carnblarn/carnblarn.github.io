this  im wearing an omni suit right now and man am i comfortable  the best part is its versatility  this suit comes with two coats three pairs of pants and five vests  the ensemble makes 120 combinations everything from dignified to sporty  if you owned one you could go from a funeral  to a night on the town without even going home  well i was trapped in just that situation tuesday night  were gonna be late for our dinner reservation  sam you and i happen  catch you later lets go put on the feedbags  well be back in a little while daddy come with us  no you go ahead i got something to do ill see you later   alright ill see you later  alright  you know i am so glad that you two finally got a chance to meet  ciao do you get it were going to eat and i said ciao  ciao im a funny guy  could you cover for me for a couple of moments   sure where are you going  to toss my lunch  chuck hows the job search going  i got something im not crazy about it  im a janitor at a biology lab  where they do dna experiments making mutant viruses   sounds like a good job to me  i dont know  makes me a little nervous all that weird stuff floating around   dont worry about it  dont sweat it  they handle all that stuff  youre right must be getting paranoid  see you later  i feel better already byebye   bye  take care chuck  he used the phone  the mans a pig  i just had dinner with a pig  hes even more disgusting when hes around food   thats hard to believe  hard to believe  the last thing i saw he was pulling his chair up to a dessert cart   what will you do about this  i gave lisa everything she wanted   what can i do  you have to tell her how you feel   i can no longer hold my tongue  want me to do it  coach come here  im a daughter myself let me tell you something about my father  my father is a very wise and learned man  but he never gave himself a chance  to get to know the boys i brought home  he would decide he didnt like them for no better reason  than one had bad posture or another one had facial hair  ill never forget when i was foolish enough  to bring home a utopian socialist   oh my god  no  i know its unbelievable i was a rebel then  the point is you mustnt make the mistake of judging too quickly   now call me crazy  you are crazy  very funny what i am struggling to say is call me a bleeding heart  youre a bleeding heart  call me cute as a button  fine  coach im a humanist  that means that i have to believe  theres something fine and noble about every human being  if we havent found whats fine and noble about roy yet  it means that we havent looked deeply enough  youre right youre absolutely right  your mother  like no one ever knocked over a dessert cart before  how about a beer  look youve gotta talk to her  coach you have to give roy a chance   you dont  thats not a bad restaurant  the dessert guys a dink but the cuisine was tasty  but what am i telling you chubs   wheres lisa  shes upstairs settling the bill  are you saying you had her pay for dinner  they wouldnt take a postdated fourparty cheque  if theyre going to be hardnosed they should put up a sign  do you still say theres something good in that  there must be  roy how about if you and i chat over here  good idea  will you excuse us for a moment  the suits getting to you isnt it  roy your personality is very    strong  amen  but i know thats not the real you  you know an aggressive personality is often a mask  for a very shy and sensitive soul  im willing to gamble that you are such a person  youre not wearing a bra are you  the man is pond scum  coach  stop her lock her in the car if you have to but stop her  sam i cant stop her she wants him  sam i havent forgotten about you  how about i run to the car for cloth swatches  i can be out there before you can scream no 700 times   you better be quick  you better be quick  coach let me talk to you  do you remember a doubleheader against cleveland  on a hot august day 1974  yeah i remember part of that   what part  i remember hot  well thats good thats a beginning  do you remember i was on the mound  johnson had been thrown out you filled in as manager  it was the last inning i had just walked the base was loaded   gosh who was up  charlie spikes  thats it charlie spikes  anyway you came out to the mound to talk to me  i was in a jam i didnt have any good stuff left  i thought you were going to yank me but you didnt  instead you said that something ive never forgotten  do you remember what you said  what did i say  you said go get him    i said that  yeah and i got him coach  well i was glad to be there to help out  im glad you were there too  if you hadnt said that my career may have ended that day  instead of when it did a couple of weeks later  what the hell are we talking about this now for  go get him   hi daddy  get him  lisa i want to talk to you about roy here in sams office  go get him what a marvellously pithy phrase  thats exactly what our third baseman said at the time  im sorry lisa  the time has come to put my foot in my mouth you cannot marry this man  you absolutely positively cannot marry this man  i never heard you talk like this before  well now you have ill tell you something i dont like this guy roy  i dont like charlie spikes you cant marry either one of them  look daddy im not dumb  i know roys abrasive i know hes insensitive  i know hes probably only marrying me so he can get pennsylvania  but why would you want to marry a man like this  isnt it obvious to you  nothings ever obvious to me  daddy dont make me say this  what  i wanna be married and i wanna have children  roy is the first man that asked me to marry him  and im afraid hes gonna be the last  honey there mustve been dozens of young fellas that proposed to you  no daddy wake up roy is the first one ever   but youre so beautiful so  beautiful  you have been saying that im beautiful  ever since i was a very little girl  but look at me  not as my father like youre looking at me for the first time  and please try to see me as i really am  oh my god i didnt realise how much you looked like your mother  i know i look exactly like her and mom was not  comfortable about her beauty  but thats what made her more beautiful  your mother grew more beautiful every day of her life   she was really beautiful  yes and so are you  youre the most beautiful kid in the whole world  thanks daddy  go ahead  come on go ahead try it  the man doesnt lie the stuff wont burn  thats a drawback  roy  about time what were you talking about in there  we were talking about me  my father thinks im beautiful do you  what  of course youre beautiful  youre stylish youre contemporary and you travel well  you just said that about your suits  roy i dont want to marry you  i decided that i want a man as good as my father  hold on here what about pennsylvania  roy you dont get pennsylvania and you dont get me  you just get more and more obnoxious  look its not like this marriage was gonna change my life  but i want you to know that if i walk out that door right now im gone  do you hear what i said  is that what you want lisa   thats what i want  then thats what you got  goodbye baby  dont bother calling me cos were through  this doesnt mean we cant put you in a new suit  youve made me so happy i mean it  care to capture this moment in a caricature  no tacky  come on lets celebrate ill buy you some ice cream  daddy no  im not in the mood for ice cream i just lost my fianc  he wasnt the greatest guy but itll take a while to get over it   rocky road  you got it   can we go  take off   i got him  you got him  so long everybody   bye  byebye lisa  lisa made the right decision   forgive my storybook mentality  youre forgiven  well laugh if you will  every woman has a mr right in mind  its a mistake to settle for anyone less  do you have a mr right in mind  well i suppose i do every woman does   whats he like  come on  no come on maybe i know the guy maybe i know him real well  well for one thing he would be very intelligent  very well educated  perhaps overeducated if there is such a thing  not particularly athletic perhaps even clumsy but charmingly so  blond blueeyed with a byronlike innocence   i know this person  who  you you described yourself perfectly  i hope youll be very happy together   i have had enough  dont throw that  thats herbie hes got a wife and four little shot glasses
