sharper knife  bye  is he  hes gone yeah  in that case  let me just say  of all the cheap smallminded  creepy sophomoric pranks  you have perpetrated in your long arrested adolescence  this is far and away the worst  how could you sam  so he wasnt your ideal date  im big enough to admit when im wrong  did you really think this was amusing  did you have lots of laughs planning it  diane i swear i wasnt trying to be funny  what were you trying to do  the truth is i never saw the guy before in my life  i met him in the back room and i paid him to go out with you  you hired a murderer to take me out for the evening  its kind of funny when you put it that way  look i actually didnt think that you were gonna get me a girl  what did you think id get you  i well i guess i  i thought that you were talking about us you and me  i thought that you thought you were the ideal date for me and vice versa  really   you thought that we  im embarrassed  i am so embarrassed  i understand   poor sam  thank you so much  wait a minute what do you mean poor sam  i didnt realise you were carrying such a torch for me  no i didnt say i was carrying a torch for you  i said i thought you were carrying a torch for me  im certainly not carrying a torch for you  then im not carrying a torch for you  fine  sam  if youll admit that you are carrying a little torch for me  ill admit that im carrying a little one for you  i am carrying a little torch for you  well im not carrying one for you   then im not carrying one for you  you just said you were  i said that only to get you to admit that you are  youre making a fool of yourself  just admit that youre hung up on me dammit   i am not  you are too  i am not  please do you think id behave like this in your home  sorry  well we are being awfully childish about this  maybe  lets leave it at this im rubber and youre glue  everything you say bounces off me and sticks to you   you love me  i do not   do too  do not  that is the most embarrassing display i have ever seen  youre absolutely right anybody can see shes crazy about him  are you crazy hes nuts about her
