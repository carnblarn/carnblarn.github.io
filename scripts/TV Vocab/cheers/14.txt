interrupt but i have something important to say  since i have been here  i have struggled to make certain changes in myself  in order to fit in to the general milieu   and youre doing a good job  it has not been easy  however i am proud to say that for example  i no longer have to cover my eyes when i watch a hockey fight  in one case i even took sides  but now in my moment of crisis  it is glaringly apparent that no one here  has made any effort to understand my sensibilities  no this is me  diane  something my father used to say when we had a death in the family  maybe itll help hed say  sprinkle the ashes  all the tangible remains of our dear one  but thank god for the intangibles  the impact of his life on ours  we remember the smile  the frown the quizzical look  the love the courage  commercials are over  fun times hurt moments of searching risk affirmation  and a whole bunch of other stuff come on celtics go   did the celtics start without me  yeah losing without him too

over an animal dying  you obviously have never had a pet  i have too   what  i had a dog  cutest little guy floppy ears big eyes  i took him for a walk every morning  great way to meet women  so you loved this dog because you could use him as a comeon   no  i bet you cant remember his name  sure i do it was fluffy  or buffy  or was that one of the girls he helped me to meet  come on what is it you want  i wanted a little sympathy  why didnt you say so  sam there are subtleties of expression  i have been saying so all day with the look in my eye  the knit of my brow my posture  how come you just dont use words  no   no im gonna sympathise  dont be ridiculous   tell me about your cat  i dont want to talk about it  well tough  well i was  pretty lonely as a child  i wasnt close to anyone in my family  my father travelled frequently  and my mother was incredibly social  so elizabeth was my closest friend and confidante  that cat could really keep a secret   thats good in a cat  yeah  she was the only one in my life who was always there  when everybody was mad at me she liked me  when id hide when my parents argued shed come with me  whenever i was sick she never left my bed until i was well again  and then  when i was 12 years old my parents separated  it was maybe the worst night of my life  i actually thought about throwing myself in the lake  but then i looked down at this cat in my lap  and i thought who would take care of elizabeth  she saved my life that night  and i know its crazy and irrational  but sam i cant help thinking that last night when her time came  she must have wondered where i was   sam youre crying  no im not  yes you are your eyes are all red  and your nose is running  im allergic to cat stories  i cant believe this  sam this is so sweet  you poor kid  wait  what are we doing  were sharing our grief  this doesnt feel like sharing grief  griefs kind of a tricky thing shall we get back to it  sam youre exploiting this situation and it just doesnt feel right to me  what exploiting  we got caught up in some wonderful emotions just now  and i would hate to see that turned into something sexual   what are you accusing me of  im not accusing you of anything  i would just like to know why this is happening  what difference does it make why its happening  were helpless swept away what else can we do  sam  you have never been helpless where women are involved  jeez  your problem is that the only way you can relate to women is sexually  you wanna know what your problem is  you always have to think about things talk about things  why are we doing this what does it mean  what are we going to do god it makes me so mad  an unexamined life is not worth living  while were talking about problems  you want to know what bugs me about you   fine  the way you eat pretzels   pretzels  thats right  three bites not two not one like the rest of us three   know what bugs me about you  what  the cologne you always wear is totally without nuance  that explains the laughter behind my back  i dont know why i talk to you every conversation we have is an ordeal  so lets not have any more and i tell you something else  you wont catch me coming on to you again   youre right you wont  we agree on something  no i think we agree on one other thing   i am getting the hell out of here  two things   diane wait  what is it   im sorry about your cat  thank you   thank you  youre welcome   ill see you tomorrow  alright
