lamb for two  dont remember what he had  i saw teddy kennedy over there  whoa norman really  i still say that kennedy will be president some day  no wait  maybe even next time you know how politicians are   doesnt make sense  i really dont think so diane  ive got a pet little theory about that  you see if you go back in history and take every president  youll find that the numerical value of each letter in their last name  was equally divisible into the year in which they were elected  so whos gonna win cliff reagan again  mondale  no not a chance see i figured it out  by my calculations our next president has to be named  yelnik mcwawa  thats the stupidest name i ever heard  sam please youre talking about our next president  so norm what was kennedy doing at the copley  having lunch i got his autograph  you disturbed him during his lunch  no god  i waited till he went to the mens room  mart martie broder i got the wrong stall i dunno  ho cliff isnt that tibor svetkovic   svetkovic where  thats svetkovic all right  based on the fact that he has a long name that you can all pronounce  i guess that hes an athlete  or will he be president in 1990  diane the man was czechoslovakias greatest hockey player  he defected to us just to play in the nhl  its an incredible story actually  he dressed up as a woman hid in a haystack  crawled on his belly under barbed wire  swam a couple of rivers and stowed away on a tramp steamer to get here  amazing  the next week the rest of his team came over on the concorde  thats what he gets for not reading his schedule  nobody said he was a smart hockey player  is this my day or what first teddy kennedy now tibor svetkovic  you better memorise his shoes you might want his autograph later  tibor i see you play all the time im sam malone

clients  friendlier  you know me im never against a wild night of friendmaking but  theres some now i feel that im supposed to be friendly on demand  and youre afraid shell stop getting you commercials  if you stop being friendly  when you play in the bigs like i did you get used to attention  when i stopped playing baseball i felt something missing in my life  i was just hoping that these commercials would get it back for me  sam lana gave me a message for you but i cant remember it   lanas here  thats it  by the way what are you two doing we got a lot of customers out there  i got a problem dianes helping me talk through it  look sam let me tell you something youve faced a lot of tough problems  you always found a solution but since sir isaac hayes came along  no offence diane i love sir isaac hayes  but since then its been talk talk talk  this is a pretty complicated problem coach  you see sam wants to break up with lana and he knows he should  but hes afraid that he will sacrifice his acting career   see  i dont understand whats going on  let me show you something come right down here  just please come right down here stand right here sam   pick that up  what do you want me to do that for  just pick it up  now get the hell out there and tell her youre finished with her  please tell him its more complic  out hustle  what do you want me to do  hustle i mean it  that was wonderful somehow your instincts just told you  button it up diane we got a lot of people out there move it  right  tell me something red  are professional athletes better between the old wamsuttas  than ordinary men  ive had no experience with ordinary men  me neither but im trying to work my way up to one  believe me athletes take their pants off one leg at a time like anybody  they take off their pants  im glad youre here theres something i want to talk about  sam what do you think of your commercial   it was fine but listen  i thought it was wonderful  ive had lots of calls about you   calls  a lot of people saw you  and they liked what they saw  one of those calls was an offer for you a national commercial  its big money and they want to fly you to hawaii  youre going to do the commercial with the osmonds  the osmonds   the whole family  thats right   even little jimmy  well were hoping  now come on  wasnt there something i wanted to say  later weve got to get some pictures for you  we should buy a new sports jacket  afterwards we can stop off at the hotel for a bite  and a nibble  and a scratch  coach  sam im getting real mad now   lana we cant nibble any more  why  i just dont feel right about it  i see  does this mean that youre no longer my agent  sam what kind of person would i have to be  to drop you as a client just because of this   a dragon lady  im no dragon lady   good  but i am gonna drop you  ive learned from past experience  once youve had an intimate relationship with a client  you cant go back to being just business associates  perhaps its time for me to find a new face  my face is new  good you still have time to return it  shes good sam   so thats it  yep  good luck in finding a replacement for me in the hawaii commercial  if it takes me longer than six minutes ill quit  boy she is good  may i ask you a question  you want to know how he was  what  you think im gonna stand here  and listen to you tell me how good sam was  fair  what do you wanna know  i want to know how you can live with yourself  i cant thats why i like having young athletes around  ive always been crazy about them  sometimes when im with one i swear i can hear the crowd cheering  i could understand this behaviour from an oversexed adolescent   but youre  an older woman middleaged  all the more reason to grab some youth  there was a time in my life when men would invent tricks and schemes  to get my attention  well now im the one who schemes to get theirs  thats not too unfair is it  but dont be too concerned someday even that wont work  dont judge me until the bloom is off your rose honey tata  she is good  fields its refreshing its satisfying  you dont feel full with fields you just feel fine  alright  another save  come on admit it i was good
