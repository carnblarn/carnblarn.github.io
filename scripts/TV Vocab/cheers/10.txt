 lt could be any bottle cap really or anything  sam you still have it  well yeah l just started carrying it around more as a superstition   could l borrow that for a few days  this  please sam this

unconscious  in my bathtub  sam do you realise that you are causing these accidents yourself  what are you talking about   well youve obviously got something else on your mind  youre not concentrating  youre making these terrible things happen  sammy let me have a dewars rot and a red wine  coach listen  how many games did he win with that silly thing in his pocket  that he takes it so seriously

lm fine  listen is walker there  alright when he gets out of the showers  tell him to call me here at cheers  alright ok thanks  l believe you had a question there  well l guess lt isnt important now  lts just that l know this bottle cap has nothing to do with baseball  and l was sort of hoping that youd tell me what its about  l know youve been curious  l didnt wanna tell you the real situation cos youll think lm silly  well would it ease your mind at all  if l told you l already think youre silly  yeah that might help a little bit  you see that little bottle cap keeps me from drinking silly huh  you dont hear it speaking do you  well nothing beyond an occasional little small talk  lt is a very little bottle cap  alright lll buy it  how does it keep you from drinking just out of curiosity  lts the cap off the last bottle of beer l ever drank  the last anything l ever drank  l remember holding onto that bottle cap during some pretty rough nights  ld wake up in the morning and have its imprint in my palm  lt was flat cos l was squeezing it so hard  when l was tempted to have a drink sometimes ld look at the bottle cap  and it would stop me  thats a pretty great little bottle cap huh  you wanna know something really crazy  the last couple of nights lve really had an urge to have a drink   lts probably for you  probably  listen thank you thank you for listening  oh well  lf l wasnt here ld be at home in bed with the brothers karamazov  dont say anything  hello hey rick how ya doing  hey thats a pretty terrific win you got there for yourself  yeah congratulations  listen l guess
