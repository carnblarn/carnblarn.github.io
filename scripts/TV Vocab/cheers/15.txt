toast  alright  to the baby  with marshall as the father its sure to have brains  with carla as the mother its sure to have need for them  im kidding what i mean is  to the baby and its luck at having such wonderful parents  hear hear  what what  i think id better just lie down for a minute alright  would you all excuse me ill be right back  i didnt even know you and carla were dating  actually coach we just dated the one time  one time  just once  its a funny thing too  because carla wouldnt give me a second look before that  or since  but she sure was ready willing and able that night  she was a woman possessed  so the whole thing was her idea  yes i think you could say that  not that i didnt enjoy myself  but i had no idea this would be the result  i was so surprised when she told me about it yesterday  would you excuse me marshall i think i need to talk to carla   you clever girl you  what  i know what youre up to you sly boots  got to hand it to you pretty smart   i dont know what you mean  yes you do  marshalls not the father of that child  maybe he is and maybe he isnt  come on carla you can tell me  im proud of you this shows real initiative  well since you already guessed youre right hes not the father  i lied so hed support it  what a great great plan  yeah well i hate to sing my own praises  well dont sing your own praises  why dont you hum a few bars of this tune  carla how could you  why dont you sit down and let me talk for a change  fine  id had a really rotten day  i got stiffed twice  sam bawled me out for something you were here  i got soaked on the way home  by the time i got the kids locked in their rooms  i had really had it  so i sat down at the kitchen table a bottle of chianti  i just started thinking about how rotten my whole life was  when i saw his face through the fog in the door window   who  nick my exhusband  besides everything else it was our anniversary  i see  but i was so down i figured we could just talk for a while you know  so we were drinking  and remembering the couple of good times we had  it was the first laugh i had all day  he was wearing his black fishnet tshirt  i could see his panther tattoo through the little holes  no woman could resist  with the rain and everything and the wine  i just got carried away  carla this is the man you once referred to as seepage  sure nicks disgusting  but he knows this spot on your earlobe  one nibble and you are a heaving mound of flesh  i find that very hard to believe   yeah  yeah   well let me just show you  carla dont be ridiculous  carla  cliff no this isnt what you think it is  no its ok im an 80s kind of a guy   seen all the right movies  yes well no  cliff you see carla and i  were testing a fascinating scientific hypothesis  scientific  i like science  step right this way carla show him   unbelievable  i didnt feel anything  well sometimes theres a delayed reaction   maybe if both of you jumped on  take a walk  listen if you need a trois for that mnage ill be in the bar  alright let me see if i have the decadence straight  when you discovered you were pregnant  you purposely seduced marshall  because you assumed that your husband  would not assume responsibility for the child   exactly  depraved  now look here whitey  you know you can talk but i got four kids  and ive been raising them alone and its been damned hard  i cant take it any more  somebody is going to help me ease my load a little bit this time  and i dont care what i have to do to get it  carla its wrong  i dont care and i dont care what you think   what did you guys do to cliff  whats the matter  we just had to pull him off the wooden lndian   cliff  yes  yeah cliff sip beer sip cliff  carla do you know the story of the telltale heart   take a leap whitey  im going to tell it to you  a young man killed an old man  while carrying out the crime  he could hear his victims heart beating in fright baboom  he was very glad when the man was dead  and the awful sound stopped  then he dismembered his victim and buried him under the floorboards  soon he could hear a sound coming up from the floor  till he couldnt stand it any more surely everyone heard it  eventually guilt drove him totally insane  you can never escape your conscience  ok tom ive been cheating on you  you are a wonderful man and i dont deserve you   im sorry  wait darling   ls this having any effect on you  none at all  maybe you need bigger babooms  diane would you just leave me alone  carla dont get upset sit down with me  thanks so hows it going dad  great i think im approaching a state of euphoria   coach could i have that beer  absolutely marshall  carla what do you think we should name the child  we got time for names marshall  the biggest argument i ever had with my wife  was over naming our daughter  she kept insisting on lisa  i wanted to stick with the original name   what was that coach  baby girl pantusso  you know carla ive been thinking  tomorrow im going to go to my lawyer  and have a new will drawn up  and all of your children will be named as my beneficiaries  gee marshall i never expected that  thats about the sweetest thing anybodys ever done  diane would you just cut it out with the stupid babooms  carla dianes in the back room  come on we got to talk  you win im going to tell him the truth  will somebody please tell me whats going on here   shes going to tell him the truth  the truth about what  sam its terrible she lied the real father is her exhusband  i dont believe this i mean i know the guy  her exhusband is an insensitive macho pig with one thing on his mind   some women are attracted to that  name one  arlene abrams  angela adams   im going home  no listen wait a minute  im going to talk to you first  sit down now look  diane told me whats going on and i just have to say something  marshall you and carla have a chance for some great happiness here  i dont think you should throw it away   sam you dont  come on let me say this   look at me marshall  look at you  yeah now a lot of people think that ive got a great life  but you have a you can have something that i dont have  you can have the love and the warmth of a family  you know if you dont marry carla some lucky guys going to  as a matter of fact if you dont marry carla im going to  im not going to marry her   i got the veil in my locker  you understand that what  get out of here youre all toe jam  you know i just feel terrible about this  i guess she really did want some help with this child  yeah shes barely getting by just the way it is  carlas probably never felt lonelier than she does at this moment  got any more of those little yellow goldfish crackers  we dont have any crackers that look like goldfish  what did i just eat  i wish i had the money so i could take care of the kid myself  me too sam  wait ive got a wonderful idea we are always taking up collections  for little league teams and to give gifts to orphans  we are now going to take up a collection to help carla  i think cheers should adopt this child  you know thats not such a stupid idea  we could all take turns doing things with the kid   right  i could teach him how to pitch  i could teach him how to hit your pitches out of the ballpark  ill do the kids taxes  coach come here  listen everybody this is for carlas kid  its going to be our kid  i can teach it how to slide into second base  you cant remember your back   i can teach him how to swim  youre afraid of the water  well i can teach him how to tie a windsor knot  why do you think you wear clipons  well i can just sit there  im going home  carla before you do we want you to take this from us  its to help out with the kid  wed kind of like it to be our kid too  when you walk through a storm  hold your head up high  and dont be afraid of the dark  everybody come on  at the end of a storm is a golden light  and the sweet silver song of a lark  walk on through the wind  walk on through the rain  though your dreams be tossed and blown  walk on walk on  with hope in your heart  and youll never walk alone  youll never walk alone
