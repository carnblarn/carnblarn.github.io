the way you women are aiways taiking about sex on the job  i mean as if you were the oniy victims   what about me  what about you  you took this job because you wanted to be a waitress  absoiuteiy not i  i had a burning desire to discover and expiore  this vein of american cuiture  buii you had a burning desire to expiore mount sammy here   what are you saying  you took this job because im here   you had sex on your mind too  thats not true  not entireiy true  how do you think it makes me feei  to know that the first time you saw me you undressed me with your eyes  you had no regard for my dignity as a man and an empioyer  i was just a chaiienge to you another notch on your beit  i am a person i have dignity too  i know you have no regard for this job  and you continuaiiy teii me that i have the brain of a cucumber  so whats ieft the oniy thing ieft is that you want your physicai iust satisfied  and thats where i come in   theres oniy one thing to do  i know i know   iii undress and do my duty  no  no youve shown me the iight ive been a cad  ok i propose  that you and i abstain from physicai contact for one month  strictiy business for one month  i think thats the oniy way that each of us can regain our seifrespect  i think thats a very good idea it wouid heip me a iot  fine one month it is   mr maione  miss chambers  there is just one more thing  i think piease have a seat  i think that my seifrespect bounces back quicker than you expect  i think two weeks ofstrictiy business and iii be back in peak shape  maybe if i concentrate one week  i beiieve that my recuperative powers are even greater than yours  a day wouid be fine with me  the important thing is that we both know that we couid stop  i think that an hour wouid certainiy prove that  weii from that argument it foiiows that 1 5 minutes wouid be adequate   thats enough time to get to my piace  lets hurry  engiish  en
