right now  drinking a beer going on and on about nothing  diane if your mom is anything like you everyone will love her  shes nothing like l am  shes very eccentric and a little hard to take at times  yeah worlds apart  diane if your mothers so rich how come youre not  l didnt want to go through life being handed money on a silver tray  for you  thank you  there she is my little baby  mommy  hello

ernie pantusso you can call him coach   or use my other nickname red  red  as a player his teammates called him red  because your hair was red  no maam because l read a book  hes very sweet though very sweet  lts nice to finally meet you mrs chambers  lts nice to meet you sam dianes told me about you  youre almost as handsome as she says you think you are  theres a compliment in there someplace  lts very nice of you to come all this way  l thought so too but you know what tomorrow is   no what  your wedding day congratulations  my what  lf youre not married before tomorrow  l lose my share of your fathers estate  my god why  darling when he died you were still a little gawky girl  with your nose in a book and a terrible facial tic  your father was worried that you would never find a mate  and that you would have a lonely life  so he made me promise that l would have you married  ten years after the day he died  he even put it in his will  so if youre still single lm cut off  why have you waited to tell me fathers been dead ten years  you know how time flies when youre having   grief  grief  so if lm not married by tomorrow youre broke  put your mind at ease lll never be broke  lll either be rich or dead the choice is yours  youre seriously asking me to get married  my attorneys have assured me that it need be in name only  just for a few days theres no other way  this is the craziest thing father ever did  not even close dear  excuse me madam l dropped the bags off at the hotel   thank you  nice to see you boggs  ld be honoured if youd consent to be my wife  l said in a pinch boggs   now wait over there  yes madam  darling think hard theres so little time  dont you know anyone whod be willing to marry you for a few days  well lm afraid theres no one lm steadily dating at the moment  excuse me  rich lady  l couldnt help overhearing your problems  your daughter has a hot thing for the bartender  l do not  she likes red  hes dumb enough to be your father  not him sam  l care nothing l feel nothing  sam who  come off it weve all noticed how you two go around  looking at each other like lovesick cows admit it  hes got you steaming under the silks   this happens to be my mother  thats why lm being delicate  diane is this true how about the two of you  ld rather marry boggs  l could make you very happy  sorry boggs just a figure of speech  thank you miss  diane hes not a badlooking fellow  his colognes an affront to society but what harm would it do to ask  mother no  darling please  l wish l was as strong as you are but lm not  without money l dont think l can make it  alright lll ask him sam   what  may l speak with you a moment   l might as well come to the point  thatd be nice  would you be willing to marry me  boy this cologne must be doing its stuff  you see my very eccentric father  put a very strange clause into his will  providing that if lm not married by tomorrow  my mother will become destitute  so if we could get married just long enough to satisfy the attorneys  it would really help her out and l would consider it a favour  ld consider it a joke marriage and me do not mix  no its not marriage lts a business arrangement  just for a couple of days and then well get divorced  listen lve been married before you havent  take my word marriage changes people  no woman in the world can hear those words and not start believing it  thats a very sexist thing to say  no its not sexist because no man can resist it either  why sam thats a very romantic thing to say  the difference is with men they get over it in an hour  with women it goes on for years  lf youre worried about me lm only doing this for my mother  yeah right  l promise you that l will not feel any emotions toward you  l learned a long time ago

romantic l will run screaming from the room  and l will clear a path for you  would the bride and groom come forward please  we are gathered in the presence of these witnesses  for the purpose of uniting in matrimony  diane chambers and sam malone  the contract of marriage is most solemn  and not to be entered into lightly  but thoughtfully and seriously and with a deep realisation  of its obligations and responsibilities  any two people who have come to this point  clearly feel the love and joy that they find in one another  can surmount whatever obstacles lie in their path  sam do you take  do you mind  what  never mind lm sorry please go on   sam do you take this woman  what did l do  l saw the leer   leer come on diane  please  please go on  sam do you take this woman to be your lawful  shes a customer in my bar l smiled thats all go on  shes a woman  well lll be darned so she is  to have and to hold from this time forward   lt was just a look  just a look  this is just a look this is what you did  can we get on with the ceremony   to have and to hold  wait a minute  whats the big deal youre beginning to sound like my wife  excuse me we are getting married  l may not be asking for 50 years of love honour and obey  but it would be nice if during the ceremony you didnt drool  you really are demanding  l dont understand why youre trying to make me so crazy  l dont understand why you chose now  to demonstrate your lack of class  lm the one doing you the favour   dont do me any favours  children please  butt out mom this is the stupidest thing l ever did  stupidest thing there is no stupidest thing you ever did  everything you do is equally stupid  lncluding not throwing you out when l saw your stupid face   sam do you have the ring  shut up  thats it

tragedy  ld be honoured if youd consent to be my wife   lts too late for that  no l meant you madam  why boggs have you lost your mind  l mean lve only accepted your familiarity over the years  because l was afraid of class warfare  l am aware of that  however in view of the developments in the last half an hour  our stations have shall we say grown a little closer  now then boggs  madam it so happens  l have a considerable sum of money stashed away  really   where did you get it boggs  from you and yours madam  lve been embezzling from your family for close to a quarter of a century  why boggs how clever of you  exactly how much money do you have  as l recall my emily post  a lady does not ask her chauffeur how much he stole from her dead husband  let us just say l am very comfortable  shall we go to dinner and talk about the future  bon apptit  you know boggs l must confess  lve always found the back of your head enormously attractive  l sensed it madam  would you do
