this patient lets call him  give him any old name thor  for the first time in my career l cant solve this problem  but it occurs to me that you might  you want my opinion on one of your patients  believe it or not psychiatrists value input from outside the profession  ld like the benefit of your experience you know women  l mean your sexual exploits  could be thought of as a majestic panoramic mural   and thors  a silly little doodle  all right what the hell  whats his problem  thors girlfriend lets call her  electra  cried out another mans name during the act of love   oh thor ouch  precisely  so sam tell me youve been with a lot of women  when you were with one of them  did she ever call out another mans name  l dont think so but then who listens  usually lve got the stereo turned up and other things on my mind  tell me whose name did electra call out   an old boyfriends  double ouch  although theyve decided it means nothing which it doesnt  thor doesnt seem to be able to get over it  so if thor came to you what would you tell him  the truth that it happens all the time   really  lt happens to all guys  ln fact l just remembered its happened to me before lots of times  l turned the stereo up because of that  really  well thank you sam lll pass that along to   thor  right lts getting late  thanks for the cold one sam  the beer l mean not diane  two sips of liquor and lm a jackaninny   lewis will be here any minute  whats your plan  plan l have no plan  unless honesty and straightforwardness are a plan  no l meant your medical plan  your humours falling

is it  lewis  lve written a mans name on a piece of paper in this envelope   good  before you look at it  let me tell you something about him  ls this the dating game  the man whose name is in this envelope  bears no animosity towards you or any living thing  hes a man who loves his country  he did it out of a sense of duty towards america god and all that we cherish  one other thing the man who did this is terribly sorry please forgive him  ok lve got another job anyway  lf l saw that name ld get so angry l might do something stupid  go on open it  l cant tell you how proud l am  to see you

boyfriend stopped by   whats his name  you know very well its frasier  frasier right thats an easy name to forget   how are you two doing  fine   ls there something on your mind  no why do you ask  lf theres a spot on an empty canvas it tends to stand out  no if l had something to say ld say it  ld even yell it out  passionately  what did you and frasier talk about  lets drop this whole thing lts going nowhere  we both have more important work to get back to  l know lm running a little behind  youre smug you think you have something on me   l emphasise think  lm not thinking  no but this is as close as you get  come on why dont you stop this silly little game  and admit youre still crazy about me  youre the one who always brings it up  lf anybodys crazy about anybody youre crazy about me

how could you betray my confidence  you didnt say no telling  l see obviously l made the mistake of treating you as an adult   why tell him anything to begin with  l was hoping for some insight  lnsight  from a man whose idea of intellectual stimulation  is to count along with big bird  ln his arrogance he thought that when l called out sam l was referring to him   and you werent  no  lt was a different sam entirely  lt wassam goldwyn  his movies always gave me great pleasure  diane sam please lets not go on this way  now its out in the open lets face it and admit the truth   what are you talking about  theres still a spark between you two  lts best that l step aside and allow it to either ignite or extinguish itself  frasier look into my eyes  you are the man in my life  there is no longer anything between sam and l  youll see the same thing in his eyes  cant l just tell him  do it sam  theres nothing going on between us lts all over between me and diane   l believe you  frasier

 ra  what actors we are sam   lm amazed we could pull that off  pull what off  fooling a man so versed in human behaviour  there is a spark isnt there sam  well  gee  l dont think it would take much encouragement  to turn it into an inferno  maybe youre right  sam lets stop stopping ourselves lets let it happen  happen happen yeah   oh diane  frasier  oh yeah  well ha ha  english  en
