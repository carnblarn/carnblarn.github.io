want to take advantage of that   think so  yes  sam malone youre a better man than youre willing to admit  maybe youre right maybe l am kinda turning into a sensitive guy  maybe lll never look at a

impression  you see l thought there was a fire  lm sorry  rebecca l might not have been totally fair with you  the reason l left was lm kinda seeing another person  l was afraid this was going to
