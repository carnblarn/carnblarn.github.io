everywhere  wed go into hotel lobbies  thered be three or four women holding up kids  he covers that   where  here in this paragraph   want me to read it  no ill read it   right there  yes  from the outside my days in baseball seemed glorious  but the greater my fear became of my true sexuality  the more i compensated with typical don juan promiscuity   does that explain it  i dont know  ive only read it once  he was denying who he was hes no longer doing that  i shouldve known  i remember sitting in a piano bar and he requested a show tune  sam i do understand why youre upset  youre afraid that now people will think youre  no im not upset  its just that guys should be guys diane thats all  sam look  your friend toms out there  he needs your support now more than ever before  he really hasnt changed  hes still the same guy you used to tinkle off balconies with  boy the world was a lot simpler then  sam im sorry about all this  i thought youd read the book and it was cool  i dont

look at this i feel so proud of you  im kinda glad i did that now  youre taking real strides in your development as a human being  a couple of other chicks said so too  this humanbeing image will get me more action than cheap wine  always the high road  norm  what was that you said yesterday  when they were taking pictures about vitos pub   its nothing dont worry about it  talk to me norm  norm its best he hears it from us  well go ahead tell him the story   you heard of vitos pub  its a gay bar right  didnt used to be it used to be a great bar i hung out there myself  what a story norm   im not finished  theres more  one night vito lets a gay group hold a meeting in the back room  gays for the metric system or something  story got in the newspaper gets a lot of attention  next thing you know vitos pub turns into vitos pub  all the regulars left sammy  out went the oars and the moose heads in came plants and ferns  ferns  i just dont want that to happen at cheers  i dont believe it bars dont turn gay overnight  you dont have to believe me i have scientific proof cliff   it happened  see  excuse me  youre talking about them like theyre ogres  the fact is there are gay people in this bar all the time  no way i havent seen a gay guy in here in ages   so you can spot a gay person  a mile away  and there are none in here right now  nope looks like a straight crowd to me  too ugly to be gay  too ugly to be out  i wasnt going to say anything but youve proved youre openminded  there are two homosexual gentlemen in this bar at this moment  come on get outta here  they told me they were gay and they appreciated what sam did  thats right theyre here right now and you dont even know who they are  nah shes kidding everybody here checks out alright  well i dont know  it occurs to me that cliff hasnt had a date in quite some time  hes right  yeah how come weve never seen this vera youre allegedly married to  could we have a couple of beers please  you bet  pattycake alert   youre sam malone  right   i saw your picture in the paper  thats good  cant wait to read that book  im not much of a baseball fan but it sounds interesting   it should be pretty good  could we have light beers  light beer   there you go  thanks  sam those guys look ok to me  they are ok coach  maybe we are a little off base norm  lets test them out  i got an idea  look at the bagonzas on that babe  this is medieval  i never knew lorne greene had bagonzas  say jack change channel its time for the benitovenito bout  should be a blood match  theyre not watching lets string em up  what are we gonna do about these guys  carla youre not prejudiced against gays are you  im not exactly crazy about them  i mean i get enough competition from women  if guys keep coming out of the closet  there wont be anybody left to date  and ill have to start going out with girls  dont worry about me i like my dates more masculine than you  not much but a little  i cant believe youre making such a fuss over two guys in a bar   pattycake  its an orgy  ferns sammy were talking ferns  come on ive seen you guys hug   yeah but we hate it  right  cliff i havent been to clancys in ages ls it still a nice place  i dont know i havent been there for a while   lets go on over there  good idea  clancys give me a break youre kidding  well check in in a few weeks and see if cheers is still the kind of bar  where a single woman can be assured of being harassed  get back here all of you right now  you mean to tell me you guys are baling out on me  im telling you within a month therell be wild music  and guys dancing and exchanging phone numbers  you know sam youve got some really great friends here  youve gone out of your way to make a bar  where customers can feel like they belong part of a family   now theyre walking out on you  we dont want them  quiet  perhaps we should step into the back room  anyone having something intelligent to say can follow me  fine anyone with a twobit opinion  alright ill tell you  sammy ive got a simple solution to this whole problem  you just go up to the guys and politely ask them to leave  and everything is back to normal  sam would never do that would you sam  no  im not sure these guys are my regulars  if i lose them i lose my bar  if single women stop coming in here i have no reason to live  no emotional appeal here sam this is a purely intellectual argument  you let this bar go gay you are gonna have to hire male waitresses  right that means im out on the street  and im not gonna be able to feed little sammy tortelli  he kicked  what whats that hes trying to say there  im hungry im hungry  please dont let sammy do this to us  thanks for keeping emotions out of it  i think its a trick sam   sit down  were all agreed then  sammy tells these guys to leave we dont go to clancys   alright  sam  just leave me alone im running a business here  what do you think i should say to them  its very simple  you just say hello were a group of snivelling bigots  and we dont care for your kind  thats good i like that  hi fellas  hi sam whats going on  ive got a problem maybe you can help me out  see im the own of this bar  yeah we know we read the article in the newspaper  right   that took a lot of guts  it really did  yeah  so whats your problem  as a matter of fact i dont have a problem  coach get these guys a beer on the house  right sam  chickening out on us  yeah sammy i thought you had more character  those guys are staying anyone else wants to leave fine  you know what kind of bar this could be  not the kind that i have to throw people out of  that was the noblest preposition you ever dangled  thank you   now let me say this  no  fine  alright gentlemen  desperate times call for desperate measures  what are you gonna do  coach last call  what are you talking about its quarter to seven  no time the glasses have to be off the tables by seven  excuse me this bar closes at seven  only on the first thursday of every month vive la diffrence evening  we go home to our wives girlfriends work benches power tools  this is the weirdest bar ive ever been in  coach what the hell are you doing  this is vive la diffrence night   where the hell did the month go  what  your regulars just tricked those guys out  how  lets have a round here sammy   whats going on here  we got rid of your friends  it was norms idea the mans a genius  way to go  norman theres something you should know about those guys  theyre not gay  in fact one of them tried to hit on me  what you said they were  i said there were two gay men here i didnt say who they were  they along with myself have had a wonderful time  watching you make complete idiots of yourselves  yeah the guys i was talking about are still here   right guys  right  better than vera
