met her yet  l dont think so not tonight  wait a minute are you ashamed of me or her  a little of both l guess  hey everybody lm back  last week on cheers l cliff clavin  postman and happy wanderer  returned from a vacation in the state of florida  lt was an invigorating experience  ld tell you about it but certain parties insist l fill you in on the story  diane and sam had a little falling by the wayside  they went separate ways sam went back to his old ones  l dont know which wagon sam fell off but back to the bottle he went  diane went what we euphemistically call  and spent time in a country hospital  after she got out coach got her into cheers to try and talk sense into sam  she talked him into seeing a psychiatrist  sam agreed not knowing that the shrink and diane were dating steadily  and rumour has it heavily  sam is under a misconception that diane still carries the torch for him  diane thinks that sam is the torch bearer  you know something l may have the wrong batch of slides  these are my snaps of fla you all know how sam and diane look  but a lot of you havent seen the sunshine state  what were looking at here is  all right who pulled the plug very funny come on  youre a failure and youre gutless because you wont admit it  youve hurt everyone whos tried to reach you  you make me sick  sam tell me whats on your mind   how much this will cost  youre thinking of money  yeah l hope its not going to be a lot because l get diane to do this for free  she used to abuse me for free all the time  well it wasnt exactly free l had to sleep with her  beneath your flippancy l sense a lot of hostility towards diane  and towards myself  look l havent had a drink in ten days  lve got a problem but lm going to aa and l think lm going be ok  no youre better than ok sam youre abundantly human  you said l made you sick  l was confronting you forget about that  l am telling you that youre abundantly human  great l really think lm going be able to handle this  l dont   lm abundantly human remember  dont you see  lm putting you on an emotional pendulum  l dont want to be on anything l want to quit   what  this is distressing   l hear sam the failure  you said

discuss it  lt doesnt matter she went nuts cos l kicked her out  sam l dont think you should use the word nuts when discussing diane  well youve met her give me a better one  bonkers  you see you dont need alcohol to have fun  ln my profession theres no such thing as a closed door  that explains how diane got out  as long as you have that humour you cant ever go completely astray   goodbye  so long

bartenders who tell great stories and jokes  no give me a good temperance lecture any time   lm sorry  yeah well  l dont have an alcoholic personality  you dont have a personality  lm going to resist hurling a rejoinder in your direction  out of the respect l bear for members of your gender  please make sure thats all you bare for members of my gender   hello everybody  coach come here   lve been dreading this moment  why  diane will beg me to get back together and lm going to break her heart  thats terrible  no the terrible thing is lm looking forward to it  and then after being in the

brook is a pastoral retreat  did you hold hands during the lobotomy  diane take a joke  l love you  frasier is a consulting psychiatrist he wasnt my therapist  how did you two get together  l was playing croquet one beautiful morning  lts a game l learned during my stay there and l got quite good at it  l saw you do that you are a naughty naughty girl   lt wasnt  l saw you do it be a grownup  lt was amazing how l could lose myself in the game  lm annoyed  when playing with someone of equal ability  it gave me an appreciation for the nobler aspects of competition   what is this business  lm not playing with you any more  fine then go to  frasier happened by in the midst of this spirited contest  and he stopped to correct a flaw in my swing  my opponent on that day was as crafty a strategist as l  we really brought out the best in each other  girls ladies  frasier remained to watch my game  and to goodnaturedly arbitrate a close call for us  under the attentive gaze of a distinguished doctor  l lost some of my concentration on the game itself  whos your doctor  who would guess a leisurely game of croquet  would provide me with such a trophy  lndeed  thats quite a story  how is your romantic life going sam  lm dating a girl that l think may just turn out to be  the woman lve been waiting for all my life  sam malone  you went out with my sister  did you think it

patient lm always there when you  oh great lll bet this is important   wheres the phone  ln the hallway   why dont you have a seat there  no thank you  l understand  what do you understand  l assume what you said in there was the truth  but obviously youre feeling sexual tension around me  sitting that close would be kind of rough on you  the fact of the matter is l dont want to work here because  l think l have a better lot in store  than a life of serving beer to squamulous laggards  please diane the mans in the room   tell frasier lm waiting outside  l understand  ltd be safer to wait around the corner l do give off this aura  thats the roach bomb  diane listen please  l have something to say and its straight from here   what is it coach  this is my heart isnt it  yes it is  diane if you walk out that door hes back on the bottle  well l cant be responsible for that  diane dont tear his heart out again please  youd do us both a favour if you stick around  just a couple or three weeks just till he gets back on his feet  please  well  lve gone this far l might as well persist  shes back  lf frasier approves lll stick around  and help you through your waitress problem  wait a second you mean to tell me youre coming back to work here  lll take it until a better job comes along  cleaning up after rodeos for instance   great sam dianes back  great  what did you say to her  l

me assure you  l could work with this man all my life and feel nothing  work l could live in the same house and never be tempted  l could sleep in the same bed and get nothing but a good nights rest  l could get out of jail after twelve years  serve on a ship with an allmale crew for another four  be dropped off on a desert island for another three  eating nothing but raw oysters  and if diane came out of the surf naked one day  all ld want from her would be the hockey scores  and you wouldnt even get that  lm afraid thats not good enough diane were leaving  excuse me diane doc could l have a word with you   what about  listen doc  lf you take her out that door now  those two will be dreaming dreams about each other from now on  but if she worked here doctor hatred  lm glad coach stopped me to ask me about  career opportunities in psychiatry  yes harvard is excellent  you see it gave me some time to reflect   diane you must come back to work  l must  you and sam had an emotional experience  now this will give you an opportunity to defuse  to demythologise your romance  lsnt he amazing  abundantly   sammy are you going to tell carla  yeah  maybe you ought to give me a hand
