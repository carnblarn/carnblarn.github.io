do  dr cox your intern asked for a surgical consult on mr carney   yeah  i suggest you do a fempop bypass  mr carneys a frail old man  whod probably snap in half from a light sponge bath  if we do surgery we could improve his quality of life  the guys 1000 is he gonna take a steamer over to europe  open a caf and finally meet that  ive made my recommendation  you stood up for what you believe

itll be fast and you wont even know its me   you just told me it was gonna be you  youll still have your doubts  the best part is youre gonna be nervous all day about it  cos it could happen at any time  like now  that wasnt it fun though  false alarm boys  all right here we go mr carney  dr wen i want you to stay focused i want dr wen to be dr zen man  christopher after 15 years and over 10000

i feel its my duty to remind you of something  see you just made a 20 bet on whether a fellow human being would live or die  now tell me just exactly how does that make you feel mr sensitive  pretty good all the best  whyd you drive someone elses car across country  its a great way to make 300 bucks  what do you do that you can take time off   i tend bar  but not just any bar its the bar  when the college kids come home its where they go   i go there when im home  so you live in your home town  i take care of my moms place so she lets me stay with her  dan you dont stay with her  come on hes not like greg brady in the attic with beads for a door  he totally has his own space  more like kirk cameron in the last season of growing pains  when he lived above the garage with boner anyone no  am i the only one boner  thats when i realised that even though i was jealous  thats not why i was trying to keep elliot and dan apart  dans doing great  the real reason was that i was ashamed of my brother  and i think he knew it too  you two should probably get back to work  these heated seats are amazing they make my butt tingle  every time you say that an angel gets their wings  its a sweet ride but as jd has made clear i could never afford this car  would you please just let it go   so ill see you  not if i see you first  i knew my brother would handle this like he always did  when there was an emotional conflict between us   can you work the windows from there  no why  oh god  please tell me that that was the horn   theres your heated seat my friend  god its everywhere  do you have any idea how long ive been waiting on you  next time if youre not here in 30 minutes  i expect a free dead body or some garlic knots  dr kelso thats extremely insensitive  i dont think so miss parker you care to weigh in  nope shes fine with it she knows a thing or two  except of course that a yellow light means to slow down  youre not understanding what im trying to say   kitty this sucks  how can i make it better   thank you so much for coming  weve been looking forward to this  you know ever since he he died   hey you ok  yeah why wouldnt i be  you and your brother the tension was palpable  i wanted to say something i was this close to getting back in the car  that wouldnt have been wise no thank you were fine  damn you you dirty ape  babe you have got to try one of these they are to die for  im sorry for your loss go ahead try one  mother this is dr turk the surgeon that worked so hard  oh please its the least i could do for  you see he doesnt even remember his name  no no no i remember his name his name was  his name was was  you know we used to call him old chicken neck  this is the problem with doctors today they dont care  no its just that recently ive had a lot of patients  so it ive gotten ive been really busy  not too busy to come here in the middle of the day and stuff your face for free   damn you woman  ladies please  this is a good caring doctor he did everything he could for bob  right  this is bob thats bob  like for apples you know bob  i get it lets see how tough you are without your costume on  go ahead and knock the folders out of my hand now   what costume  you werent wearing a gorilla suit  is someone running around in a gorilla suit whats he look like   a gorilla  no its not me   why knock the folders from my hand  because you asked me to  here you go   i didnt ask you to do that  that comes free with the folder knock   how are you doing  good sir  i dont have time to stand and flirt  there have been rumblings that you let your brother play doctor the other day  dr kelso i  if i had one shred of evidence that incident actually took place  youd be working with my nephew francis so fast itd make your head spin   sir i dont follow  he cleans pools  i forgot you didnt know  i trust we will not be seeing your brother in the hospital  not inside no  my god im totally going to hell  turk wait people get thrown out of funerals every day  why are you laughing  off the top of my head id say its because hes suffering  of course i love the poetry of someone putting himself on a pedestal  then getting knocked back down into this puddle of selfhatred   with the rest of us  did you do this to him  i dont know does anybody ever really do anything to anybody else  youre gonna tell me why you did this and it better be good  how does for poops and giggles grab you  isnt there something you want to talk about like cars or sports or boobs  boobs remember fred keifers mom  she wore a tank top to freds 13th birthday party  she taught us how to bob for apples and three guys passed out  great story now how about something with more substance   remember the cans on pat clarks mom  those were awesome  forget it  elliot come on what does she expect us to talk about  maybe that youre embarrassed by me you make excuses to your friends  about how i live my life  oh yeah  were working hard on a cure   lets go field trip  i got things to do  off to another funeral come with me and if youre late for the graveyard  ill scour the obituaries with you this weekend and we can go nuts   carla put you up to this  my idea  i want to be close with you i just cant figure out how turn around  turn around  you see dr wen in there  hes explaining that something went wrong and the patient died  hes gonna tell them what happened say sorry then hes going back to work  you think anybody else in that room is going back to work today  that is why we distance ourselves thats why we make jokes  we dont do it because its fun we do it so we can get by  and sometimes because its fun  but mostly its the getting by thing  and by the way  bob  who doesnt get that  were proud you became a doctor but just because i havent achieved as much   doesnt mean i dont like what i do  nothing wrong with being a bartender   i like living with mom  she makes great eggs  all in all im pretty damn happy im happy you know  and now for the apology  thats a load of crap look i know you ok  the reason you wanted to pretend youre a doctor  is cos you hate working in that bar and you wanted to feel like somebody  youre not driving that car across the country for the 300  youre doing it cos you like how you feel when you drive it  the funny thing is you could be that guy  but youre afraid that if you have to try at something you might fail  and thats not a chance youre willing to take  what can i say its been a real pleasure seeing you  right then i knew id never see my brother the same way again  you can never let go of the kid inside of you  that girl in the wolf outfit is checking you out  id let her blow my house down you know what im saying  you see its the kid inside of us that keeps us from going crazy
