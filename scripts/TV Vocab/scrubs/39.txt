get that on the planet  is from my brett favre bobblehead doll  fine you wanna know what i really think  your problem isnt making bad choices  its that you identify the good choice and then intentionally do the opposite  you see behind this boorish bravado of yours  is a paralysing fear of letting anyone into your life  and it isnt because you werent loved when you were a kid  youre so egocentric that the love wasnt enough  so you pulled pigtails  and you pushed the fat kids into the dirt  so no one could ignore little perry  well little perry is now 40 years old  and is so invested in this narcissistic notion of yourself  as loner that you cant quit  and youll just keep dumping on everyone around you  until eventually and please trust me on this  there wont be anyone left  theres a million reasons a relationship can crash and burn  give me a break  whether its because you dont have the stones to make it work  sorry i have to cancel tonight  or you just get sick and tired ofjumping through hoops  ok you win  all right you dont have to worry about me asking you over and over anymore  eventually everyone bails  two bits  if it isnt my favourite career counsellor  you dont have more tips on how to climb down the ladder  ive been thinking about how you blame me for everything  and how you just send a constant stream of crap my way  and i decided i need a break  so you came by to tell me youre a complete wuss  no i came over here to tell you i traded with another resident  and switched off your service for a while  well tears and hugs there katie  but unless you wanna come inside and give the fellas a lap dance  i gotta say sayonara  cos i got 20 guys in here and its about to get nutty  all the best baby  turns out last night got in my head  so this

people  carla whenever you need to talk  its just i dont think that turk is being fair  he didnt get the answer he wanted when he wanted it so now hes pushing  what do you want  ok wait wait wait  are you kissing me because you want this to go somewhere  or because you feel bad about blowing me off yesterday  actually i dont care either way  i decided to bail on cox for a while you know  he sees a shrink every day and is still the biggest pain in my ass  is he in group  maybe its not everybody else maybe its you   yeah  good sharing   i see your point  that sounds right   anybody got anything else  yeah i got one  come here  i dont think hed do well in group  so whats up with carla  im starting to think if she really loved me id know by now  maybe its time to retreat  protect myself so i

pancake panda  thats what im talking about  keep it together peepants  you have six seconds to find that soda you were holding for me  has anyone seen a soda oh for the love of god  what is it there bobbo  im sorry  what did you say  i spoke to my cardiologist  and he said if you hadnt caught my high blood pressure  and it had continued unchecked  it might have resulted in a mild case of death  must fight urge to rub it in his face  anyway i owe you one  must rub something in someones face  hows that coma going for you there pal  much better  i bet you never made out in there before  no never  come here  nurse i need clean sheets right away to room one thousand  shes covering because shes embarrassed she likes a nurse  and i really cant figure out why  thats because youre doing a womans job son  have a good one  great why did you do that  you know what i do for a living doesnt make me feel like any less of a man  neither does my love of baking or gardening  or that i occasionally menstruate   what  elliot lighten up  stop worrying so much about what everybody else thinks  go ahead ill see you outside  ok  boy i gotta say your wife is hotter than i ever imagined  hello perry youre obviously trying to bully me  but you cant bully me because i dont fear you   now im leaving  kelso asked me to give him a physical  he said thank you and told me he owed me one  you actually made a decision  that benefited you personally and professionally  well a resident kinda talked me into it  come on youre telling me  that you took the advice of another human being   this is a great moment for me  congratulations  thank you  and perry  if theres someone at that hellhole of a hospital you actually listen to  do everything in your power to keep them around  because that person is nothing short of a genius  batcave  hi yeah im stuck in the elevator  yeah im afraid it might be a little while  because you did this  ah no i think we both know you did this to yourself  well ill let you go  hello  hey laverne have you seen turk around  hes off today honey how come you dont know that  i dont know  everybody i appreciate solidarity  but i did not blow off paul because hes a nurse  stop leaving bedpans in my locker it makes me cry  paul and i are just different ok  please elliot this is not about paul  this is about you  about you not being able to commit because that means saying goodbye  to whatever unfulfilled fantasy of love you concocted  after seeing too many meg ryan movies  but men dont make everything all better theyre only human  dont punish him because you grew up so fast  you never let someone else take care of you  hes not your father he wont disappear at the first sign of trouble  and as scary as it is being truly vulnerable with another human being  whats even scarier is that deep down inside you know you picked this man  and if you run away youll run away  from being the kind of person you always wanted to be  carla i just met the guy  all right here we go baby here we go  are you talking to that chilli dog  hey  yeah well  i find that they dont repeat on me as much if im real friendly to em   what  nothing  its weird seeing you in the real world you know  i feel kinda guilty youre so nice to me and my buddy  and weve never had a real conversation  we act like school kids and argue over who we think you got a crush on   its totally you  what  vanilla over chocolate please  in the event of a water landing  yeah incoming how you doing  did you climb down an elevator shaft to torment me  sometimes in life you gotta do what you gotta do  look i promise you the door open button was not working  no its ok we can work this thing out  seriously put your hands together like youre praying  hey dr cox good to see ya  what the hell hes a decent kid  be a man and apologise to him from the heart for once  for gods sake lily stop being such a complete wuss  and come back to work with me   fine  good  give him a pat on the back hes wanted it since day one  just do it  the second dr cox patted me on the shoulder  i thought about how he always shows up just in time  ill hang onto this  i guess in the end everything comes down to timing  sometimes you just have one moment to seize it  paul  i know that ive been acting like an insecure idiot  if youll forgive me id love to take you for dinner tonight  screw that ill cook for you  ive only got one apron though so bring your own if you wanna wear one  oh please you all wish you could bag a nurse   shes right  shut up zeltzer  you shut up  and if your timing is good and it works out for you  make sure you cherish it  because bad timing can mess up everything  you wanna grab a cup of coffee  i dont know  ill let you talk to it before you drink it  ok we can get one cup of coffee   just one cup  one cup sure  hold on one second let me just answer this real quick   yeah hello  ask me again  sorry but i gotta go
