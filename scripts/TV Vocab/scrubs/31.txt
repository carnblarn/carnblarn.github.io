your shrill voice  whining about a teenyweeny problem  it took every ounce of selfrestraint i had  to keep blood from shooting out my ears  in the time it took you to say that  you could have just helped me  well yes it does but here thats what makes it delicious  what i am not gonna say a word   you just did  except that and that  and that and that and that  it just keeps on going  hey cutie

because im a waitandsee kind of guy  you know elliot in modern medicine  were often faced with tough decisions   you are amazing  well  amazing is sort of a strong word  i just show up and let the lord work through me  you think youre a better doctor than me dont you  well i do have better bedside manner  i anticipate problems way ahead of time  oh and my hair never gets in my face so yes yes i

my god  dr cox i hate to bring it up again but it seems important  julie likes our tushies  newbie any doctor with a shred of selfrespect  wouldnt give that woman the time of day   oh julie  well well  if it isnt the captain  tenille of the underworld   hi boys  hi julie  perry do you know the name  of the new antiarrhythmic drug that julie is selling   thats a tough one  its plomox  nice work nancy drew now see if you can solve the one  about the missing id badge  plomox is the most effective antiarrhythmic drug  on the market and it has minimal side effects  only nausea impotence and anal leakage  im getting two out of three from the conversation  you kids can talk more over the pharmaceutical dinner  that youre helping her put together   dont do this to me bob  do it to him bob  perry were going to need a big staff turnout  so dont take no for an answer   you going there chief  no  if i wanted to make small talk over lowgrade beef  id have dinner at home  im just increasing your lidocaine drip  just a little bit ok mr brooks   hey carla you got a second  no actually im swamped  i got a present for you  why would you get me a present  why does it need to be a birthday or anniversary  for me to get my baby a little somethingsomething  plus you figured youd get yourself  a little atwork somethingsomething  ill get the door  wow a bus pass   help me get off my bra  thats not all  youll use that bus pass for an allexpense paid trip  to nurse practitioners school  where youll learn how to be more than just a nurse   just a nurse  did i say just a nurse  i meant a nurse  you were complaining about having to ask  for permission to feed a patient  youll have more responsibility make more money   so i thought  you thought the only reason  ive done my job for the last eight years  is because nobody came along to hand me a brochure  and a bus pass  youre unbelievable  damn  dude i am just as disappointed as you are  jd even though i decided to send mrs kahn to surgery  i know you were trying to help me in your own way  i overreacted thats something im working on in therapy to not do as much  i still think you should have gone with   my waitandsee approach  youre not the boss of me  im not the boss of anyone  permission to use the can boss  enough already im not doing this  fine permission granted  so mr brooks is doing peachy huh   peachy keen  great  a patients improvement is always cause for celebration  here at sacred heart and yet for some reason  im not wearing a party hat  sitting bareass on the hospitals copier machine  you know why its not because i have the name  johnny tattooed on my butt hes an old sailor buddy  and if you went through what we did youd understand  its because somebody went ahead  and increased mr brookss lidocaine drip  and by law that could only be a doctor  are you a doctor nurse espinoza  well   no sir  youre damn right youre not  so hows the guest list for tonights steak dinner shaping up  well now i dont have any definitive confirmations yet  but admittedly that could be because i havent asked anyone  why does it have to be like this every time i come here  i mean what is your problem with me  ok well  for starters everyone here knows that you sell pills  and yet you use phrases like take orally  and increases blood flow way way too much  i mean jeepers julie you have half the doctors on this staff  believing that if they join team plomox  that they get an outside shot of you showing them  the cotton inside your bottle  would you like to know the real dirty dirty little secret  its that your drug is so good that you guys went ahead  and put about a 600 markup on it  but the only ones who get hurt are the sick people right  since your company doesnt care about them  and youre part of the system that means you dont care either  thats whats making me sick thats all  well you can say what you want perry  but we both know that youd love nothing more  than to smack this fine ass  perry  harder perry  dont stop perry  oh perry that feels good  so you promise me youre gonna be more careful  dude the only way to feel alive is to push the limits   once in a while you know  well keep it real  god see ya geek  buy a cup  whats wrong  mrs kahn died on the operating table  a lot of things can take you by surprise  sometimes its just realizing that youre not as happy as you thought  sometimes its a hot chick smacking her tushie  and sometimes its when you take a chance and lose  this just sucks you know  this is a crucial moment pick your words carefully  i guess i was right after all  stupid  i had to talk to elliot before the morbidity and mortality conference  nothing puts you in a worse mood  than having to explain why your patient died  i just need to talk to her  when theres no possible way that she can interrupt me  peanutbutter cracker go go go  what i said earlier came out completely the wrong way  and i just want you to know that i act  bite me  oh shes a crafty lass  baby i know you had a rough day and i was part of it  i thought id make it up to you by taking you out to a nice dinner  which waitress do you think will do me  id say you got a shot with the busboy over there  you realize this doesnt count right  yeah but baby free steak  you just flat out get women dont you   this is kind of romantic right  check it out  its a meat cookie  oh god  hello boys and girl so hows the food  free  and how are you dr cox  im just here to enjoy my meal  so unless those things dispense a1 sauce id keep moving  that is so so funny you know what else is funny  how you claim you want nothing to do with me  yet every time i turn around there you are  i wonder why that is  oh that feels good  finally we have dr reids necrotizing fasciitis case  deceased now dont be frightened sweetheart no ones on trial here  at least not until the family sues your little behind  sweetie im not joking  but should that happen you may rest assured  that the hospital will stand behind you 100 per cent   thank you very much sir  now see there i was joking  try to keep up  oh god this is painful  its like watching a shark circle a baby harp seal  dr reid faced a very difficult decision  and she chose an extremely risky course  hes like a royal python torturing a hopper mouse  man i love animal planet  i believe we all have a lesson to learn from dr reids case  and here comes the crushing blow  i saykudos to dr reid  whatos to who  without surgery her patient didnt have a popsicles chance in hell  by making the tough choice she at least gave mrs kahn an honest shot  now for all of you waitandsee doctors out there  if you do not get to the point  where you have the courage to take risks  you will never be a great doctor   never  never ever  turk dont eat off my plate  youre right baby im sorry thats rude  so youre having steak with a side of steak  thats right turf and turf  you know what im on my second glass of good wine  im watching my boyfriend try to eat his body weight in meat  and i am extremely tickled  that the only thing dr cox wants isnt on the menu   what  what can i say  im finally having a good time   thatll pass  i still think its lame  that you didnt like turks nursepractitioner present   dude  told you  hey elliot im sorry that i was such a jerk before  but hey i got mine right  anyway thanks for being classier than i am  and not rubbing it in my face  no problem hey you never told me that   youre part native american  what are you talking about  arent you a member of the waitensee tribe  come on i laughed so hard when i thought of that  that i peed a little  i changed right after  why wouldnt you want a better job  hold up my babys happy with being just a nurse  did i say just a nurse nobody at this table said just  i meant a nurse right baby  thats right  why  oh just not smart even for you  excuse me for not having all your male ambition  i cant believe anyone would look down on me  because im good at what i do and because i love doing it   im sick to my stomach  me too turk me too  no baby im serious i think im in trouble here  baby  permission to speak sir  you know what no no you may not

gotta go  you ok  look at that i bounced back  baby my stomachs gonna explode  its only heartburn sweetie youll be fine   hows meathead  i know im not a doctor  but if you order a strong antiemetic thatd be great  you would ace that nurse practitioners program  really you think so  what if the classes are too hard  what if the teachers are mean if the other kids dont like me   ok  i would ace that program  but i barely get to see my boyfriend as it is  and if i went to class five nights a week well  i guess im taking my chances on turk right now   him  somebody make it stop  i just dont want to look back and wonder what could have been   yeah  thanks  hows it going  you have more jokes dont you  i jotted a couple of things down  you see that nurse over there i love her  every night at 1030 for the last year  ive watched her come in here and get a cup of coffee  and not once have i had the courage to even ask her her name  well if it makes you feel any better she has a snaggletooth  the point is kelsos right you know  its not even just professionally  in my personal life i dont take any chances either  i want to i just  i can never seem to take that first step   come here  what   come on  i dont want to go anywhere  i wanna spend time with snaggletooth  i guess it all comes down to what were willing to risk  for some of us its our feelings  wanna talk  no  for others its our future  baby  if i had to do it again i would   cos i love the steak  i know popi  i know  for me it was taking a risk period  even if that meant starting with my very first step   youre gonna love this  i dont wanna do it  whats the worst that could happen   we could die  ok the second worse  cant we just go and talk to snaggletooth  no here we go  one two three
