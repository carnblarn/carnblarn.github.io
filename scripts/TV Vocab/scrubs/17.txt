heres what happened  he was screwing up constantly  i didnt force him to quit  i dont think its my fault he quit  most of the bad things that happen here are your fault   i was talking to her  i wont say what you wanna hear  nurse roberts says hes the most incompetent doctor shes worked with  laverne whatd you say about jd when he first started working here  he was the most incompetent doctor i ever worked with   its not my fault he failed  you failed  youre supposed to be his teacher  see to me that sounds like its your fault i dont know  shocker yeah  where you going stay and play  so youre having trouble asking out kristen   no problem  whoa curly  i got no problem wanna have a drink   no  see im fine  you know how men are always talking about themselves  women like to talk about themselves more  thank you youve touched me deeply  you can be cynical but im telling you  get kristen to talk about herself its on its on and poppin   if that doesnt work do what i do  which is what   show her the booty  no you put that away  think of the children  doctor  philip i was wondering if you could write out this discharge summary  wheres the fun   excuse me  from now on  when youre wondering whether ill do something  ask yourself wheres the fun  ltll be a timesaver for both of us  im betting that if you were really honest with yourself  youd realise how unsatisfying it is to ride on your fathers coattails  no im ok with it  josh this is completely crazy  you told me i shouldnt be a doctor  kidding josh  you know what forget all of that you have to hang in there  now i promise you i am gonna help you  here we go  youre doing it  yeah you are youre doing it   so what do you say  i know what youre trying to do  my whole life people have felt sorry for me   why would anyone feel sorry for you  im clumsy  im always throwing up i dont even have an ass  those are the same things i was dealing with when i started here  except for the ass part i actually have a great ass  its firm like mutton  im not buying it dr dorian  but thanks for trying   so where you from  chicago you   pittsburgh family brothers sisters  one older brother you  were gonna keep the focus on you are your parents still together  yep  do you have any idea how hard youre making this on me  no but i wonder if someone slipped something into my soda  he has that effect on everyone the first few weeks  i gotta go well pick this up later  pick what up  what up dawg  not a strong move with the tightywhities  if you wont help go wait for your trust fund to mature   dr reid can i see you a minute  dr kelso i am so so sorry  i just got so frustrated plus im pmsing  well the pill plays havoc with my cycle im like  dr reid  you talk too much its a problem  why are you doing your med students work   well his father  i hate his father  but im the one who has to suck up to him not you  for gods sake woman show some cojones  its hard trying to figure out how to reach somebody  the thing is to think of someone i look up to  and remember how they got through to me  the only way you could be less productive  is if you were the wall on which youre leaning  but then youd be providing some jackass  with a wall on which to lean and reflect on what a jackass he is  i know here its a conundrum but dont you worry about it  ill tackle that one right upstairs in the meantime  you could pretend to be doing some work  and even though you dont have your basket  its just a terrific time for you to skip away shirley  skip away  skip away go ahead   hello philip  lemon head  yeah i get it cos of the hair  i was hard on you from the start  but on the other hand as you know youre an incredible tool  so ill lay off if you drop the attitude and well start fresh   what do you say  i dont wanna  but if youve got a problem with that go see my father  i think ill do that  wait dr reid  i had some time to think about it and what the hell lets start fresh  philly  i dont wanna  sorry we got interrupted before   its ok  where were we  i told you my parents were still married you yelled at me  right of course i did thats me all over   why are you washing your hands  i dont honestly know  i guess i dont have anything of interest to say  i got something to say  dr cox you are an attending so you should know  its inappropriate for you to be sniffing around this woman all day  and you you are a med student who should be learning from me  but every time i turn around youre talking to him  so im telling you i forbid you to get involved with that guy  sorry doctor  you do realise that you just effectively signed your own death warrant  dude do you like know any women at all  hi  i know were not supposed to be seeing each other but  why did you page me  i dont know why i still have this thing on  put your gloves on josh i need you to get an abg   i cant  newbie wait  newbie  youre the only one who knows if you wanna be a doctor  but right now i got my hands full ok  what do you say you put some gloves on shirley and get the hell in here  now locate the radial pulse  josh look at me you can do this  it looks good  no way  what do you want a cookie put your scrubs on and get back here  go go go  go ahead  thats it   could you redo that  yeah  could i get some more wine  puhlease keep drinking  im throwing myself at you and youre still trying to get me drunk  well baby you gotta play all 48 minutes   cheers  cheers  this is fun  i love the part right before we start hating each other   really  you wanna know something  what  i feel like im using you to get past another person  thats not as sexy as you think it is  its this nurse  this unavailable nurse i swear  look kristen i think youre great  but this whole things just not fair to you  if its ok with you  i think ill go ahead and decide whats fair to me  that works for everybody  perry  actually i prefer dr cox  you like strong women dont you  are you kidding me theyre the only ones i let ruin my life   this is way too easy  bring it on  stop talking  dr reid i wrote out your admission orders and got the blood cultures  good now beat it im eating   elliot you ballbuster  i know isnt it great  a lot of us freak out when med students come  it feels like being forced to accept new people into your family  it changes everything  me i was more struck by how these newbies made me look at myself  who i used to be  who i am now  and who i might some day become  but hopefully not too soon   player  hold me down   such dorks  my god  my god
