like what theyve done with halloween  but our thing is that youre a little girl  thats who you are but thats not fair  man once dr cox gets on a roll nothing can derail him  my mom died  except that  thank you for coming i know youre busy  its tough working in a hospital no matter what is going on in your life  you have to dive right back into the middle of things  so anyway you said you like mine  i had the wife whip up a pair for you   you like em  do i like em  the other day i was asking myself  how can i display my package  in a way thats alluring and professional  well theres your answer

teensy snafus  good god ted its not a dr seuss story  now listen up nametags  over 50 per cent of our lawsuits can be traced back  to poor patientdoctor communication  to that end if any of you still feel the need to flap your babble holes  you will be joining me in my new daily seminar  on doctorpatient relations  my first invitee will be dr murphy whom i overheard telling someone  stop bleeding oh god please stop bleeding   it was a gusher  next catastrophe  idiots  i hate him so much  save it for our weekend bike ride  would you like to try one of my worldfamous devilled eggs  no thank you

were doing fine  shes clearing you out  wrong she came by because she knows today at work i need my  squash goggles  i have to saw something later  shes a drama queen jd  when her husband was in a coma it was taboo and exciting  but now that its ok for you to be together  the relationships got no snap  its got no crackle  jd its got no pop  i know because im a drama queen too  well jamies not like you ok  no pop  nine pounds in a week let me ask you a quick question  are you trying to make my head explode  because you have no idea just how frustrating it is  working your ass off trying to inflate  a tiny little balloon inside someones clogged artery  and all that person has to do really is i dont know  go for a walk in the morning or choke down a fresh green salad  and you come back here looking like that  i know here i am supposed to be dr giveacrap  you wanna know the gods honest truth this is a fact you are what you eat  you clearly went out and devoured a big fat guy didnt ya  see dr cox this is the sort of hostile behaviour  that can cause us legal difficulty  ted i just might rip that tie off your neck  and jam it down your oesophagus  i think you proved at nurse roberts aboveground pool party   that doesnt solve anything  dammit you cant just go around  browbeating nut jobs and bullying fatties  im not a resident so im not going to your lameass seminar  so in essence

hole she left  she would like that   baby she hated me  yeah she did   holy  calm down   i didnt mean to scare you  why are we whispering  to see if you would whisper because i whispered   i think i

to get up early so just be cool  im sorry it was a total accident i just  dont lie to me i asked you to go so you punched through my coffee table  oh my god she does want drama  sometimes you make me so crazy  come here ill take care of you  this is totally normal in relationships you have to roll with the punches  even the ones you dont see coming  if there were anything i could do to make you feel better id do it  lets get married now  she wants to get married now   she says spontaneity is romantic  wow that is romantic   so how pregnant is she  shes not pregnant  i was getting really psyched for this whole wedding  the dancing the band youd hook up with carlas sister   which one  the drunkest one  theres no bachelor party and you being the best man  i know you wouldve hooked it up  all right guys lets make it happen  dude  it wouldve been awesome  im having a hard time getting excited about all of this  you work here so i guess we could do the whole ceremony for 40 bucks  praise jesus  as for my relationship i was doing anything i could  to keep the drama alive  jamie and i are gonna be together and i dont care what you think mom  because i dont want salad thats why  jamie and i will be together i dont care what you think dad  im warning you stop eyeballing my woman  actually jd i think it was that guy  no it was definitely that guy  unfortunately i was running out of ideas   hows the drama queen doing  i dont know how are you   why cant you admit im right  because youre not right  no pop  what was that all about  i wouldnt stoop this low for drama  well we used to be a couple  now youre in the picture who wants me back   fine id stoop  she better watch it  lester honey i dont want you using the stove on your own  nurse i asked for an extra pillow an hour ago  im talking to my husband why dont you get your own pillow  what  and they stuck you in here for that  i apologised to the old man anybody can have a bad day  and what about you there beavis  oh uh  you know im getting a little tired of the sexual innuendo  in your endo  thats great stuff  ted why dont you be a sport and get us started   people were here today  snore  new idea all clam up for an hour so i can get some shuteye   oh and nervous guy  yes dr cox  if i were you id swallow that entire mouthful of baby carrots  if i hear you make one more damn crunch  ill use the rest of the carrots in that bag to make you completely airtight   hey jamie  hey slut  i can totally explain why jamie said that  you know turk says hey player when he means hey buddy  jamies from cincinnati and in cincinnati they say hey slut  neat  are you sure youre happy were doing this  are you kidding its my ideal wedding  its cheap theres no hassle  plus you said youd call my mom and explain  no i didnt   whats in it for me  this  my god  give me the phone ill call her right now   you are such a mamas boy  please dial mommy  dammit perry youre there to teach  if i wanted somebody to lay around and do nothing  i wouldve wheeled in a corpse or my housekeeper rosalba  captain clipon did you go ahead and tattle on me  oh please with the shocked look  newsflash im sterile  i mean gutless  my guys swim in circles  i think its the bike riding   hey elliot  hey slut   excuse me  carla  could you give us a second i got to talk to her privately  thank you  i just wanted to say you were right about jamie  what does jamie think youre doing here  saying not to show up at my apartment drunk naked crying  you know whats weird i really like this girl  but im not sure i carry it on without all the drama  you have to gamble that once the dramas gone therell be something there  if not its her loss still if it helps  thanks  ok here we go  when hospital employees fail to communicate with patients  there are ethical and legal ramifications that lead  to financial hardship and grievances against  doctors  this is useless i thought we were going to learn something  barbie why did they toss you in here  they didnt im auditing  fine  if you wanna know the real skinny  if you wanna be good doctors and nurses  youd damn sure better get ready to get in trouble a lot  because patients are stupid and they are really scared  some of them need you to hold their hands and you should  others need you to kick their asses and you should do that too  it comes down to whether you have the guts to say  what you know in your heart of hearts you really should say  so ted hows professor cox doing  excellent sir  you know what else   i quit  no you dont  well im leaving early  no youre coming to my office and doing busy work  fine but im getting a soda first  whatever   doctor  janitor   whats that smell  i dont know  although it smells a little bit like the truth  my poor wife slaved over these  she just cut off a pair of scrubs and hemmed the bottom   whats the big deal  whats the big deal  the lord didnt bless my wife with all ten fingers  shes only got pointer and thumbpinky  look im sorry ok for so many things  but im a doctor i cant really wear shorts to work   you cant wear shorts to work  nope   you cant wear shorts to work  not allowed  thanks whats up with the manthong  oh nothing im just trying to mend some fences  do you think elliots somewhere right now crying her eyes out  oh without a doubt  but not about me  i kinda made all that stuff up  it just seems like you and i only really click  when something crazys going on  i guess i dont really wanna be in a relationship like that   is that an ultimatum  no jamie  no its not an ultimatum its just something to think about  oh shoot i gotta go   you guys are having problems  yeah  hey sorry im late  well its just not a wedding without a dallas cowboy cheerleader is it   are you ready sweetie  since the day i met you  sometimes it takes a priest to keep you from making a big mistake  christopher before we begin remind me of the brides name  carla  i know its silly and its only for one day but since i was a little girl  all i wanted to do was have a big beautiful wedding   baby you dont wanna do this  what  since your mother passed youve been feeling lonely  and like you dont have any family  im your family now whether we do it like this  or we wait and do it like youve always wanted to  holy cow talk about your gigantic time wasters  tell me about it  lighten up slut  what now  i think relationships can be defined by big moments that dont happen  or by the little ones that do  thats the stuff  but once you get past the drama its actually pretty simple  all we have to do is whatever it takes to make her happy    yeah  yeah
