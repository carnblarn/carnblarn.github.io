                there just a tiny splinter  its funny i cant stop thinking about aesops fables  you know the one where the lions always hassling the little mouse  then the mouse pulls a thorn from his paw  right and the lion kills him anyway yeah   no he doesnt  trust me   sandy lets start work  sandy isnt necessarily a girls name   short for sandra  clear  hello perry   oh god the exwife  jordan what a coincidence  you were in my dream i cant say for certain  but i was having the flesh torn from my bones by a crosseyed water snake   you right  yes yeah  lets play a game ill throw out an adjective describing  how one of you is in bed and you guess who it is  remember i had no idea she was your ex   ok clumsy  dont answer that  no worries  goodbye jordan  sandy   good job dj  you know its jd  at least i remember the names of all my sexual partners  im sure that girl from high school and your bunkmate from camp morning wood  are both extremely grateful yeah  camp meadow wood i made a lanyard  it sounds insensitive but hospitals can be boring  if a policeman gets into an accident with a bad guy hes chasing  it pumps you up  ok move it along fellas theres nothing to see here  ill be over here  officer berson shortness of breath and chest pain  think anyone else gets this excited over a car accident  maybe hank  we werent the only ones psyched to be in the game  the doctor is in  bad guy this is why you dont run from the police  baby are you ready to rock  right another cocky resident that wants to start surgery  before the attending shows up  i just figured that if we finished here quick enough  we might have time to pull the stick out of your ass  what do you say   perry  beelzebob   lackey  hey dr cox  im being honoured tonight by the board of trustees   they asked me to say a few words  yawn  anyway id like you to be the one who introduces me   seriously  yeah   not interested  i didnt ask if you were interested  i deeply dislike you it keeps me up at night  then use that passion put that rage on the page  heres an idea why not use big chief flop sweat here  teds not an impressive man   hey that hes right  youre ok  you have a slight arrhythmia so dr dorian and i will monitor you closely  but dont worry were on top of it  theres nothing like that feeling of taking charge of a situation  mary rhoda chart please  what i stutter give me the chart  attagirl oh man i dont like his o2 cells  get me a doughnut will you  you mean like a a blood pressure thingy  i mean a glazed thingy and i like sprinkles on half of it  if you cant find a halfsprinkle get allsprinkles and pick half of em off  you know that was kind of demeaning  youre right would you apologise to her while you get me some coffee  and be quick or ill have the manager send over a different waitress go  youre done now yeah  the frustrating thing was down in or turk was probably running the show  steady dr turk only about two more hours  can you just scratch my nose please  no i can scratch my nose  oh that feels good  miss sullivan i want to thank you and the rest of the board for this award  the fact your first choice passed away last week  in no way makes it any less special  are you sure cos it seems like it does  bob as far as the intro thing goes ive given it a great deal of thought  but im afraid im gonna politely have to tell you to blow it out your ass  i think we both understand how this works  its like when my dog baxter goes winkle on the carpet  he always heads straight away from the tool shed  but we both know thats where hes gonna spend the night   charming story  yeah  the fact is i make it a rule never to get in bed with people  that i have nothing but contempt for   that feels good jd  what   youll now pay for that  god i hope so  were residents now were supposed to have more responsibility  i scratched my nose with bad guys toe  accept the fact were the most underappreciated people here   bambi i really feel for you  thank you  she doesnt  i spend my time getting orders barked at me  by people who take credit for my work and blame me for their mistakes  and im expected to hold the doctors hand  you should try trading places with me for one day  its actually not that bad and the lace feels soft against my package  nah  im glad we finally had a chance to talk  you and me both i havent had anyone to talk to lately   well ok  but boy you sure talk fast  byebye  next time we talk maybe i could finish a sentence or two  you still like her  why because we had a conversation in an empty room  that rooms not empty  listen girlfriend i dont want to hear your misguided romantic notions  cos you see for me sex is a sport like racquetball  play hard for half an hour work up a sweat   and hope you dont get hit in the eye  i know you care about her  in fact i bet that after you two are done playing racquetball or talking  or whatever you crazy kids are calling it  youd like nothing better than to just lie there and watch her sleep  its impossible to actually lie next to jordan seeing as she sleeps  hanging upside down from the ceiling wrapped in a cocoon of her own wings  thats nice  i thought about what you said and youre right i owe you  so i got you a date tonight   who  tim   im not gay  what  oh ok i get it neithers tim  unfortunately im on call tonight  as weird as this place is during the day its even worse at night  thats when all the weirdos come out  like the er doctor who likes to work nights cos he says hes up anyway  hey bro  or the nurse who everyone agrees is just a little bit off  or if theres a full moon  hey this is my band we all work in different departments in the hospital  you told me last time we   legal  accounting  shipping and receiving  onsite property management including pest control  nighttime security nonarboreal gardening services  and tenantrelated easements and liens   you got promoted  its about time  hes been busting his hump around here for six years  dr kelso lets us practise here at night  oh yeah i remember cartoon theme songs  no no no that was lame  we do primetime now  what attendings are stuck here on call tonight   everyones at that kelso thing  i think dr cox is on  he went home but said that carol could cover for him  is carol the one with the really firm butt  well im carol so yes  its disturbing how obsessed you are with your butt  youre missing the point no one is here tonight but us   we are running this hospital  this is our house   were in charge  i love my butt  its amazing how one moment you think you know exactly what you want  oh god come on  the next moment everything changes  ok elliot the er doctor knows theres no attending up here  so instead of treating hes admitting everyone youve got 12 so far  turk oncology cardiology and paediatrics all need consults  that phones for you its the clinic they know youre on your own  so theyre patching all nightcalls through  and bambi room 201 needs an art line room 202 needs reintubation  plus carol youre needed in icu  to place a femoral swan under fluro on mr freed  never actually done one of these unsupervised before  youll be fine  thats when i realised tonight we really were alone running the hospital  luckily someone had the guts to take charge  youve all been on call before so you dont have a safety net  most of the time you dont need one anyway right  fine ill tell your patients theyre on their own because youre too scared  no carla im a doctor i should tell them  come on peeps lets go kick some sick patient ass  that my friends is one nerdy honky  thats two   my back hurts  oh yeah  well my front hurts so touch  always a charmer hi  hi im gonna go and get you a big icecold glass of water  what do you think of that  oh sweet mother of mercy carla you were right you were so right   what am i supposed to do now  duck  who paged me cos a patient thinks their tongue is too spongy who  under no circumstances tell any of them that im here  yeah look just go home and tell jordan how you feel   tell a woman how i feel  well i guess you could duck  this is ridiculous he admitted him to cardiology because he has heartburn   i hate er docs  you dont understand my relationship  duck  now thats just not funny  i dont know why i was scared of placing a femoral swan  i guess i couldnt stop wishing there was someone over my shoulder  i was even starting to see things  ok mr freed i think i can do this  im gonna need a carm in here   want me to knock him out  what are you doing in here  helping you out  this isnt like being a janitor its not something everybody can do  oh so you can do my stuff but i cant do yours  yes  ok hotshot what would you use to get a coffee stain off a tiled floor  i dont know the rough side of a sponge  damn it  officer bersons spiralling a bit  pulmonary edema seems secondary to acute mitral regurgitation  if it is a flail leaflet hell need surgery  his vitals are so weak i wouldnt be confident taking him to the or  the classic catch22 between medical and surgical  somebody needs to be decisive   ok heres the plan we do nothing  sounds good   im in  thats inspiring  meet in a few hours to see if his vitals have improved  yeah this ends now  turk shouldve known that the worst mistake a doctor can make  is setting foot in the hospitals free clinic at night  i dont care if you shave down there thats not a medical issue  but it sure is pretty  maam you dont have mono but you do have halitosis mint  maam three baby tylenol is actually an underdose for a woman your size  yes congratulations you are doublejointed  you can see we dont have any more beds and we cant handle any more patients  ok you talk way too fast  if you could just keep one person downstairs wed throw a parade for you  she needs you to give her a break  oh well tell her were really swamped   she can understand you  yeah  well then understand this chill out bitty  didnt you go to get water like an hour ago  more or less jordan theres something i really want to say to you  say it while im drinking water because im dying of thirst  i like you again  there you win you can do your victory dance or slaughter a goat  or whatever it is you do when youre happy  you dont like me   i watch you sleep  that gives me the heebiejeebies  i cant stop thinking about putting up with you  look this is pointless angry shallow sex  why would you go and ruin something like that  im real sorry but thats not enough for me anymore  sweetie i have feelings for you too but unlike you i have some balls  so you dont hear me whining about it  look perry i cant let you back into my life  and watch you personally and professionally sabotage  every single chance that you get  its too hard i cant do it  but i have changed i have  i see a shrink now i actually see two to tell you the truth  good god what do you want me to do to prove that im not that guy anymore  there you are had to make me sweat didnt you  good for you buckaroo  i took the liberty of writing out my introduction  bob kelso is the love of my life  my wife was going to do it  she doesnt even seem to be here  what are you gonna do  lovely  you rang  lurch  my stethoscope is stuck up there and i need you to get it down for me   you put it up there  thats really neither here nor there   fine right were even  oh thank god  you couldve just asked me to stop hassling you for a year   ok i want that then  its too late  but i use those for listening  they want you upstairs in room  208  his vitals are the same theres got to be one attending in this hospital   you guys are unbelievable  thank you baby   not the good kind  i know  you claim you want more responsibility  but youre being outsmarted by a doctor with scrubs made of hemp  youre afraid to stand up to a volunteer whos answering the phones  and did you ever place that femoral swan  its on my todo list  i know you were hoping officer bersons vitals would go up or down  and this decision would be made for you but nothings changed so its on you  we all knew what we had to do  surgery  sometimes just making a decision is half the battle  gentlemen we can rebuild him we have the technology  we can make him better than he was before  better stronger faster  your shinunununununs could be louder  you guys were fine  good evening everybody  bob kelso is  in moments of truth we always reveal who we really are  bob kelso is an awful awful man  im not joking hes the devil whats wrong with you people this is  great stuff perry great stuff is this guy a hoot or what   ill get your ass for this  jordan  thank you  sometimes were our own worst enemy  and sometimes we rise to the occasion  everything went really well  even though we know that tomorrow morning  the three of us will go back to being the most unappreciated people  in the whole damn hospital  what you doing here i thought you were off last night  i switched shifts to help some friends have a good one  guys wait up  shut the hell up ted its morning
