didnt he assumed  and did you correct him  ive been really busy at the hospital lately  is that how you see this relationship as some mad dash to the finish line  ill take you into that bedroom now  and you will be walking sideways for the rest of your life  because i will have used all your up and down now is that what you want   no  good  because what i want is for this to be a real relationship  i want us to know each other better than we know ourselves   wow  thats right wow  so if you really want me daily and nightly and eversorightly  that sounds like something youd say  show me you know me  i think you should let the kid meet the ladies  youre the one who told kelso that mr martinez was dead   thats terrific work  looks like word gets around  what in the name of are you there god its me margaret were you thinking  im certain invasive vascular procedures have a low success rate on dead people  that tips procedure was for mrs blitt down in 103  you see she doesnt have insurance  but mr martinez had great insurance  should i talk slower or get a nurse who speaks fluent moron   you dont have to be mean about it  what do you want from me  i dont know if they taught you this in the land of puppydog tails  where you obviously if not grew up then spent most of your summers  but youre in the real world now   dont say it  i still think i was right  once every 63 seconds a man says something stupid  that another man hears and punishes him for luckily this wasnt   thats it  oh no  do you know what this is this is me washing my hands of you  i will not be in the same room with you again starting  now  tissue  its a challenge  little bit of flow like  fighting joe hooker  i dont need dr cox big jerk  i hate him  hey sport or should i say howdy mr pouty  its been a rough day  so i hear well anyway im very proud of you dr  just look at my badge  dr turk  this is my roommates badge we must have switched  thats a great anecdote you should write that down in your journal  then your kids can read about it when youre dead   theyre waiting for us  in a moment  if you go easy on the stories id love you to join me for golf tomorrow   thatd be terrific sir  super  you wanna show a woman you know her buy her a little something  none of my patients are improving   im gonna buy her flowers  yeah  please been done to death  i dont get it i do everything by the book  maybe thats the problem you approach things too clinically  how about chocolates  with rich clich centres  have you ever treated your patients  with something other than traditional medicine  im gonna buy her a really nice pen  no she loves to write she handwrites all of her letters  because she says emails too impersonal thats perfect   a pen is good  yeah  all i gotta do is find time to get out of here and maybe ill buy her one  all im saying is theres more to healing than whats in the books  i talk to my patients i sing to them ask what their hobbies are  and tell them ghost stories about an old sea captain  thought youd be interested in that kid jareds chart  look at that white blood cell count  and all it took was a visit from the rock  the rock was here and nobody told me   the rock couldnt make it  well somebody did something  it felt weird knowing dr cox and i would never be working in the same room again  check her lfts and coags  every time i think something the opposite happens  im not having sex this weekend  youre cute  whos the present from   my boyfriend  when did he give it to you  hes pretending yesterday didnt happen if he thinks ill forgive him  the reason i was bent out of shape yesterday   i accept  dont interrupt me come here  pull that curtain  mrs blitt over there needs the tips procedure no insurance  she can now look forward to a lifetime  of encephalopathy and jaundice thanks to bottomline bob   is he really that bad  i hate robert kelso  i hate his family friends the guy that cleans his racist lawn jockey  i hate anybody who even associates with him is that clear  totally  call me  elliot check out these ass slides  hows that stuff even get up there  i fell on it  i fell on it  i fell on it  i was bored  the doctors in the er have a box where they keep all this junk   next to the lost and found box  theres no lost and found box  theres an ass box   thats not carlas pen  i had no time to shop  beautiful day for golf sports  yes sir dr kelso  i dont know what youre trying to pull but i am not a guy you wanna mess with  steadman i need a tee  a tee or some tea sir because ive brought both  its just a friendly game of golf with a couple of guys from work  excellent our fourth has arrived  whats up newbie  hes got nothing to say after all hes here too   i thought you hated kelso  i do  and watching his face as i kick his worthless butt  up and down this golf course every week is basically  its the most fun i can have without having to cuddle afterwards  good night irene fantastic golf shot sir  real nice length now does your husband happen to play  but no im not a hypocrite for being here  whats your pathetic excuse you whiny little suckup  ignore him just let your game do all the talking  thatll play  dont open it please dont open it  since weve been chatting maybe you could raise your heart rate for me  what am i doing this is stupid  dont make her open it  are you that busy  you do know me sweetie i love this  its so its so cool its cool   im woozy  youre fine  todays the day i finally beat his uppity insubordinate  great shot doctor  you see i always say keep your friends close  and your enemies closer  can you believe him youre away and yet he hit first   its a technicality  but theres the rub  the rules are there for a reason  if you break one why not break them all  before medicine ever became a business  the only rule was to do your best to help the patient  like it or not medicine is a business  if the hospital shuts down then who are we helping then  so only people with money deserve medical treatment  dammit  its about whats best for the hospital  its about whats best for the patient  the only reason i go back to that hospital day after day  is because i care about those patients  every one of em  youve got a lot of potential sport  you stick with me  and youre going to be climbing the ladder very quickly  isnt that what you want  you have to sink this for the win cox  newbie i almost forgot  im gonna get mrs blitt her tips procedure tomorrow  with or without insurance and i want you to help me  now tell me do you have the stones to sink a putt when you have to  see you next wednesday  i love this game  i cant decide if i should help cox  at least you didnt give your girlfriend a gift that used to be inside someone  thats true  i have magic breasts  how many has she had  almost one  you know what cox doesnt need your help  taking her down for a tips procedure  he shouldnt even be putting you in that situation   youre right  hell yeah im right  screw cox   not afraid of him are you  hell no  maybe a little   thats four  thats three  thats five  all righty were through here   somebody call it  wait  right time of death 620  hey theres my buppy  did you just say buppy  cos thats not gonna work for me  carla we gotta talk  we can talk later  laters good  lets just worry about getting you better ok gorgeous  i decided cox was wrong  theres room to play by the rules and care about the patients  do a wallet biopsy on her and if the insurance doesnt check out  i want her in the nursing home before she can gum down a single fruit cup  that was when i realised how dr kelso truly saw these people  could i have a price check on a 74yearold female  with prerenal azotemia  bag her  come on i wanna show you something  wait its about the pen  i thought a really nice one would be a great gift  and i see a great one in the lost and found box  there is no lost and found box theres an ass box  yeah there is  and you were this close to getting everything you wanted  i assume this is what you wanted  yes  and yet you tell me that your thoughtful token of love  wasnt a token of love at all it was an ass pen  you come home and tell me this because being open and honest  is more important to you than having sex with me  are you coming or what  hell yeah  stay rowdy stay  it took me three hours to realise   excuse me miss  can i help you  im afraid i have an awful case of the gottaseeems  thats not even a real disease  at what point did i become a crazy person  come on yes exposing yourself to a dead guy  might have been a tad unorthodox  and it might be hard to live down   im waiting for the but  sos everyone else  thats not funny   thanks glad i shared  come on  when i look at you i look at a doctor  who will do whatever it takes to help a patient   really  yeah really  and on that note  if you still want my help im on board  its way too big of a risk for a peon  i just wanted to see what team you were playing for   so it was all a test  besides   i already did it  cox  run junior daddys home  did you think i wouldnt find out what you did   what did i do  you insolent  im insolent  i know it sounds melodramatic but as i watched the two of them  they werent battling for patients or insurance but for my soul   she needed the tips  ive got you this time  i can taste it  its an old story really good versus bad right versus wrong  the dark side versus the light  ive been waiting for this moment all my life  easy chewie  ill teach you to respect this institution  i hope you learn from this  no  youre suspended effective immediately  well sport it looks like a permanent spot just opened up  on the golf course  how does joining the chief of medicine for a weekly round sound  im not really that into golf  i guess thats your choice isnt it dr dorian  i liked it better when he didnt know my name  thats one for me  thats two  im hurt
