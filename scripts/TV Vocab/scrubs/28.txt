found out that dr wen actually recommended you  for that trip to mexico  im sure you know how hard it is for me to admit that to you  so i was hoping that we can use this as an opportunity  to repair our relationship  what do you say  oh my god ok fine look you go to mexico ok  and by the way dolor en el asno means pain in the ass  i thought it would help you when you introduce yourself  i dont want your charity  you go and every second youre down there  i want you to think about how i kick your ass  up and down these halls all day long  now where was i  oh yeah  there you go prom queen  there is some really tragic stuff in there  so you know go nuts  all of these are your patients  no but when word got out about your little offer  a bunch of other docs wanted in  oh great more for me  im afraid you have hepatitis  meningitis  esophogeogastroduodenocolitis  yes its like being blind in one eye  except youll be blind in both  im really sorry  theres nothing more that we can do  hello we can hear you hello   why wont it stop ringing  hello   for the love of god hello  all right look  ok i never meant to insinuate you guys were stupid all right  everyone knows youre a hundred times smarter  than the jackasses that run this place   is that so sport  no sir its not so  would you just go ahead and answer it already hello  hello  hey take that smart guy  troy thats not how we do it   mr hogan what the hell  what would you do  if your fiveyearold begged you to have a bite of his dinner   you had two dozen ribs  i know   i dont even have a kid  thats it ive had enough   this is ridiculous  will you lay off mr hogan  so he made a mistake people make mistakes  it wouldnt hurt you to cut em some slack once in a while   thanks man  this isnt about you  dont eat meat carla  every time you screwed up with me ive let you off the hook  when have i ever screwed up with you  ok never but we both know that if you ever did  i would give you a break  now lets see how you like it when i walk away from you  actually i need to go this way  right the first time   awesome  youre gonna love this one  well not anymore  we had to take both of her legs bilateral gangrene  and seeing as her husband recently passed away  and her insurance at the dancers union  probably is not going to cover it you should tell her  she wont be able to stay here with us for her rehab  what room is she in  there is no room in fact in the history of medicine  theres never actually been a patient that depressing  i made her up come on now barbie  keep going down this road youre gonna go up to the roof  and jump the hell off  mind you its only five stories high  so youll just wind up back down here where i will treat you  then ill be forced to jump off the roof  which as i was suggesting to you is only five stories high  and are you starting to see a pattern forming here  i just wanted to be colleagues  barbie as long as you stay and work at this hospital  im always gonna be your superior  thats just the way it goes  dont get me wrong you can keep trying to connect with me  i mean hell youre so damn entertaining  you just might make some headway  but still you might be better served  and this is a crazy notion if you could stop worrying so much  about who does and doesnt notice you  even for a second  thatd be good  thatd be real good  i think every day is made up of tiny little tests  some are tests of character  some are tests of fortitude  others are tests of friendship   i spoke to my brother today  really  hes having some problems  and if youre lucky when it really matters  youll pass with flying colours  hola kdog  yeah full bar  take us to mexico
