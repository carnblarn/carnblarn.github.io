notified me  that he will be vacating the office next to mine  his deteriorating health has made it impossible for him to continue with us  oh dear should we send him a card  absolutely  see if you can find one that says  crippling arthritis or not get out of my hospital by sundown  so i can knock down your wall and make myself a giant office   youre a wonderful man  i dont mean to sound

killing me ralphie  you are killing you did not swallow that thing  dr kelso i am through taking my clothes off in front of men  i think i can speak for all of us when i say well live  every woman here hates undressing in a coed locker room  except naked nancy but shes an exhibitionist  she has other problems  we have a coed locker room hot damn  dr reid if you really feel the need to discuss it  write it on a piece of paper and slip it in my suggestion box   really  yeah ted show it to her   sorry  its ok  so this locker room  do you have to be a doctor to change in there or what   can i borrow a pen  here take this one  thanks  see  we dont always have to be like  we can be how you doing good thanks  this can work we can be there for each other  its just a pen scooter not a kidney   thanks  no you keep it  really  makes me look smarter  off to scrub the crappers  so heres the deal mrs larkin you have a valvular defect in your heart   oh god  relax steve hes a worrier  me too im a worrier   the thing is  ah here it comes  the thing is pregnancy puts such an extra strain on your heart that  had we known about this beforehand we wouldve suggested you think twice  about getting pregnant before getting the valve repaired   i wouldve done it anyways  yeah you wouldve  got a healthy supply of pluck dont you   i cant breathe  youre ok   lets do this  i love the pluck  how could any woman possibly stand this  hey nancy  youve had six bran muffins ralphie how is it that you dont have to go yet  i still have to pack sure you wanna have dinner  i am positive   great  ok all right  all right ralphie new tack  i want you to do what i do  imagine that there are tiny men inside your booty  trying to push the dookie out ralphie  can you imagine that for me  you told my son there were little men inside him he barely sleeps as it is   sir im sorry i was wrong  that was sick  but still if you could do this for me  i would greatly appreciate it  next time your son has a bowel movement  take the dookie put it in a ziplock bag  and just call me on my cell phone  its for my girlfriend  ralphie little men pushing it out pushing it out  mrs larkins aggressive she wont let her husband finish a sen  shut up would you please at least shes ballsy unlike that husband  the overly thoughtful sensitive type that drives me crazy  what  i think the larkins complement each other  theyre a good team kinda remind me of us  roseanne now granted i was as usual only half listening to you  but i get the feeling you just compared us to a married couple  i know a girl can dream but this is never gonna happen   get in here  atrial fibrillation  call an obg yn for an emergency consult and notify the nicu  what the hell is going on  sometimes its hard to find the right words  once i knock down this wall right here  i am going to have more room than i know what to do with  sir im so happy for you i could crack  sometimes words come easy  dr kelso i demand a female locker room  i loved it but why spend all this money on this fancy dinner  sometimes the words dont come out at all  no reason  ultimately you grit your teeth and just say it  if we dont deliver the baby your wife could die  you get used to the whole balanceinthehospital thing  you know when one person lives another dies  and how it seems to even out  but its so soon you said so yourself   whatll happen to the baby  were gonna do our best  but it never seems fair when it happens in the same family  youre telling me if we dont deliver the baby now  my wife could die and if we do our child probably wont live  sometimes as a doctor i wish my life was more like my favourite tv show  come on death isnt that bad  especially if youre dying from laughter youre on candid camera   no im not honey no  ill give you honey no   come out  where are the cameras  we gotcha theres a camera there there and there  mr larkin we need a decision from you here  im not ready to do that  you go ill cover her  dr kelso i am not leaving here until i get an answer  sweetheart there are lots of people who think the hospital  would be a better place if we made some changes  take ted for instance  i feel id be more productive if my phone dialled out  this hospital has always had a coed locker room  ah back when i was a resident i remember  blahblahblah nostalgic story  now get the hell out of my office  not you ted  ted get the hell out of my office  im gonna miss you so much  im only going to chicago for five days  ill call you when i land see ya   dont go  have you seen mr larkin  no  thanks for the pen   oh no  this was my favourite tshirt  and this is my favourite skin  you know i would never mean for that to happen   i know that  this is a little cosy for me  i dont think you people are getting how difficult this is  trust me i wouldnt want to have to make this decision  i wish i could ask my wife  shed be better at handling this than me  you know you and i are a lot alike  we may seem like the kind of guy you can just  throw in a headlock and draw a moustache on  but in crunch time we always come through  its time  come on  dr reid are you off for the day  i just didnt have a place to change  laverne im going to pretend youre not wearing that  dont you usually wait to get home before you do that  plus according to county statute all medical facilities are required  to provide singlesex bathrooms and changing rooms  put that in your suggestion box and smoke it  dammit whered she learn all that legal mumbojumbo   what are you doing ted  im trying to whistle  you know so you wouldnt think it was me  stop the cab whoa hey  baby open the door open the damn door  what are you doing   take it  sorry maam my bad  what is going on  i gotta ask you something before you go  what  youre doing great youre gonna be fine  nice job newbie a real nice job  all we gotta do now is cross our fingers  death is always hanging around this hospital  morning  ultimately it all boils down to what your attitude is about it  im not afraid of death  i mean if i got a heart that would be great  still if they told me it was never gonna happen  i think thatd be ok too its the waiting i cant take  i just wanna know one way or the other you know  i got an idea  why dont we switch to a cheerier subject  what do you think death is like  i really hope its like a big broadway musical  everyones all dressed up and singing to the rafters  and you go out with a real flourish  i think its like a game of dodgeball  theres a lot of chaos and screaming  and eventually you get your glasses snapped in half by the big kid  who already has underarm hair  but then you wake up in the hot nurses office  and when she leans in to put that bandage on your nose  you get a sense something could happen  if you took a chance and buried your face in her knockers  holy cow im so sorry  i guess for my part i think death is a lot like that story  quite frankly but if there is a god  itll be a lot quicker and half as painful   its fun to annoy him  thats what i do  so theyre making that office into the ladies locker room   yes ted  bummer  hey maybe whoevers over here might not stay there forever  im doing a research fellowship so ill be anywhere from 15 to 25 years   thats a long time  yeah  youll probably be dead  weve known each other for like a year and a half right  turk thats my ride  give me a second ive been thinking a lot lately  im talking here  im gonna miss my flight i gotta go honey im sorry  will you marry me  what did you say  i think i said will you marry me  turk wow  i got a ring  i dont have it on me but its in a safe place  i cant believe this  ive imagined you saying this to me a thousand times  i just never imagined that when you actually asked  all i would say is i need to think  cool  yeah phew  thats what i was hoping to hear  i love you i really do  love you too  ill be back in a few days  ill wait  congratulations you guys hes doing great  i guess my theory about life and death  balancing each other out in the hospital doesnt hold true  i guess sometimes you get lucky   whats going on  shes coding  any minute now  my ship is coming in  ill keep checking the horizon  ill stand on the bow  feel the waves come crashing  come crashing down  down down on me  and you say be still my love  open up your heart  let the light shine in  dont you understand  i already have a plan  im waiting for my real life to begin  my real life to begin  oh dont you understand  i already have a plan  im waiting for my real life to begin  on a clear day  i can see   see  see  see  see a very long way  shes gone  youll be ok  yeah
