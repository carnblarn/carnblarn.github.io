you are brave youre an attending here  youre dating a student and holding hands  normally i wouldnt do this but there are mitigating factors   like what  for starters you are very hot  i have kind of a special evening planned for us  im not gonna give away everything  but i will say it involves wine an amazing dinner  and a safety word weve agreed upon in advance  you are gonna make a great mom  i told you what to do if the stitches start to itch   dont scratch  unless theyre really itchy  and then you go to town you go nuts you do your thing  dr reid one of the nurses found your stethoscope in the bathroom  thank you so much sir  this isnt it i had them leave yours where it was  lets try to be a little more responsible shall we   i went to college with that guy  lucky you  used to play his guitar every saturday night  at this coffeehouse off campus   remember the guys name  robby something i think  dr kelsos name is bob short for robert and robby is a nickname for robert  like oh my god

know that dresser i got for carla yesterday  its not for her place its for mine is she moving in no one asked me  what the hell is this crap  its dr kelso mr sloane dropped the tape off  why do you care so much  it would be so interesting if there was this whole romantic  creative vulnerable side to him  i think its a fascinating study of human behaviour  i think youre a fascinating study of human behaviour  the musics not that bad  my tuscaloosa heart  you have to admit if that was him itd be pretty weird  youre pretty weird   stop doing that  you stop doing that  mr simons room  you dont have to hide from him  im not i have a new exercise programme called short bursts   is it working  do you have to ask   yeah  whered mr simon go  im guessing not heaven he died   number two  number one what happened  he had terminal cancer he went into respiratory arrest and passed away   number two  number one   did you give him naloxone  we tried intubating him and cpr  hey number two   he went so fast  say hey number one   hey number one  hey number two  its kristen i missed you tonight  i went ahead with the date on my own  but it wouldve been almost as fun if you were here  i wish you were here see ya  you are a stupid man  honey im home  you should lock your door theres horrible people out there  theres horrible people right in here  maybe you forgot how this works when i say that hi honey thing  you take your pants off thems the rules of the booty call  jordan believe me i enjoy our meaningless  postdivorce sex as much as the next guy you marry will  but your timing could not be worse  maybe you dont remember the terms of our settlement  when jordan needs sex  jordan gets sex  listen sweet cheeks i am seeing someone who  let me guess dark hair domineering doesnt take any of your crap  a lesser person would mock your inability to move on  im gonna consider it an homage  there is something so  soft about you  im seeing someone right now who by the way is great  and yet theres this other woman who i cannot get out of my head  shes totally unavailable which may be why  i cant get her out of my head  and maybe and this is a whole new theory  i keep thinking of this other woman the unavailable one  because i am so afraid that the first thing might work  and god forbid i ever do something that might make me happy  do you have any idea what im talking about  if i have to stay here and listen to this crap  ill need a stronger drink   i hate you  i hate you too  fair enough  im sure that was dr kelso singing  it wasnt elliot please i dont wanna have this conversation again   i think it was him  it wasnt   but what if it was  good lord  having a latenight tea party are we  i guess my invitation mustve been lost in the mail  as long as im here im partial to lemon zinger  dr turk is here cos his patient is going into surgery tomorrow  but i was hoping we could do an ercp first  youre breakin my tuscaloosa heart just turf him  tuscaloosa heart  this is what i like to call my told you so dance   you guys awake  holy sonofacracker  not now maybe in the morning before work  just thought id talk to you guys  jd when you were a kid  did you used to walk into your parents room in the middle of the night  mommy are you and daddy playing wheelbarrow  son go back to bed im fixing mommys back   yes once  turk youre not being sensitive  ill be sensitive at breakfast baby turk out   whats up bambi  i cant stop thinking about mr simon  i neglected him cos he was a jerk and im just   worried thats what killed him  could have been the neglect  couldve been the terminal cancer  youre a conscientious doctor  youd never do anything to hurt a patient you know that  youre right  thank you carla   peace out turk  night  we all know what goes on in the bedroom   baby since were up  no  but its also the place to reflect on whats new in your life  tell me about this girl you like  but most importantly its where you can lie back  let everything go and finally just sleep  or not  so you got a good nine minutes of sleep last night  remember its a new day yesterdays gone and its never coming back   bambi about yesterday  its back  they want you to present mr simon at an m and m conference  morbidity and mortality conferences are fun meetings  when they think you might be responsible for a patients death  bambi dont be nervous  is it hot in here its like its hot  no im fine  theres no reason to start obsessing you did nothing wrong  morning killer  have a good one killer   hey number two  number one   hey number two  stop doing that   look number one  number two  we have the same name but i cant spend my day playing this game  im sorry  hey number two   hey you  you got a minute  you know what would make surgery quicker if we didnt have to be clean  listen i gotta say something to you here  you are so great you know  youre sexy youre smart god knows youre dangerous   you think im a spy  no  look i just want you to know  that i havent been in this relationship 100   and its because of how great you are and how much that scares me  but from now on if you want  sister youre gonna be getting the whole shebang  cos im all in baby  bring it kabowbow  yeah you come here with the kabowbow  my bunny is a baby blue  bunny how things change bunny spells love to me  ten songs about bunny not one song about his wife  its impossible to write a love song about anyone named enid  dont you get it this tape shows exactly why kelso is kelso  he used to be this beautiful wonderful sweet caring man  he found the love of his life and she slips through his hands  that is so sad  have you guys ever stopped to think that maybe bunny is just a real bunny  thats just stupid  yeah i know  im ok  im ok im a k  im a k what the hell does that mean  dr dorian we have examined aaron simons file  before we begin do you have any last words  im a k  that was terrible can i have a doover  initially there were concerns that mr simon may have been overmedicated  we have concluded that his pain control  was both adequate and well within normal limits  thank you for stopping by  sir i am not sure how this thing usually works  but i was kinda hoping we could take a closer look at me  ive been sort of doubting my performance  and it would be really helpful if we could just all  talk about it as a group  dr kelso isnt looking to do me any favours  if i did something wrong hed call me on it  then how come i still cant sleep   my god  i know i didnt do it  joy  i told you when he saw us together hed fold his arms and do the teeth thing  he did the same the first time i saw him naked  no way same here  this is beyond horrible  relax i came by for a board meeting  and to meet the new lady in your life and warn her   thank you  youre welcome  kristen  this is my emotional baggage  baggage kristen  be nice  i wanted to thank you for helping with that dresser last night   sure no problem  hes a great guy   thats why you blew me off  i should leave  moving furniture with that nurse you have a crush on thats your 100   no the 100 came well after that  her boyfriend was there the entire time  and bailing on you is far and away the best thing that could have happened  because it made me realise that i was sabotaging myself again  if you dont believe me ask jordan  would you please tell her what i said to you right before you left this morning  left where  youre unbelievable  thats too bad i liked her  i did too  dear god  why dont we just say something to him   like what  i dont know  i heard your songs and theyre extraordinary  elliot dont   i wont  pinkie swear  i heard your songs and theyre extraordinary  excuse me  you swore  you know what just forget it  we wont bother you any more  sir whatever happened to bunny we gotta know  actually the music came before bunny  i learned to play the guitar growing up as a young rapscallion in mississippi  but things didnt take off until i moved to memphis  then i met the colonel and the hits just kept coming  but it went to my head i gained a lot of weight started wearing jumpsuits  and ate tranquillisers like they were trail mix  then in 1977 i died on the toilet  or did i   you never played the guitar  that crap is for hippies  now for gods sake get back to work  thank you very much  i always turn to the person i trust the most  cos i know when he says i didnt do anything wrong ill believe it  looks like you screwed the pooch there   i didnt overmedicate him  you didnt  i always check your orders  but if youre wondering whether or not you treated mr simon differently  because hes a complete jerk well  i think you know the answer to that one   depends what you mean by different  i have to warn you i just got dumped  in front of my exwife not ten minutes ago  its always easy to treat the nice ones nice isnt it  but your drug addicts your child abusers  your gardenvariety jerks  you know its barely misting out  its my hair if it even gets damp  it frizzes out and becomes wildly unmanageable   mine too  it was a joke ya girl  newbie the only way to judge your growth as a doctor  hell as a human being  is by making sure you dont repeat the same mistakes over and over  that was really great but next time would you not look me in the eye  it gets in the way of what i come here to do  then stop turnin around   thats classy  wait a minute  you dont have to go you know if you dont want to   are you really that lonely  kinda yeah  all right ill toss you a quickie but no talking   ill talk if i want to  be quiet  the worst thing about being a doctor is you fall short a lot  the best part is that if you wait for a few seconds  you can redeem yourself  hey number two  hey number one how ya doing  i guess theres good and bad in all of us  woke up this morning  without you  oh it aint just  the skies thats blue  and theres nothin i can do but close my eyes  and dream about you  dr kelso your wife is on line one  hey bunny no i forgot  yeah no yeah ill do it as soon as i get home  well im s  i guess hanging up on me is the right thing to do  and once youve accepted all sides of yourself  its a lot easier to sleep at night  good night number two  nothing  gotta be boobs somewhere  nothing  jackpot  cheers  hmm
