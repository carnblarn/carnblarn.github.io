                i dont know why i came to watch turk  when i couldve been asleep  i guess i havent seen much of him lately  its not like im desperate  what makes you think you know better   in my gut i know im right  we need this decision now   fine then its on you  yes it is  nurse   erasure  yes doctor  i hate this song  me too man  a hospital room can be kind of a romantic place  maybe its the soft green glow of a heart monitor  or the way the moonlight reflects off a bedpan  our shifts keep overlapping on friday nights  closest thing ive had to a date recently  well i had a great time tonight  oh yeah me too   so can i page you  dont do the twoday waiting thing  oh baby i dont play by the rules  so goodnight  wait is she joking if shes joking and i kiss her  of course if shes not joking  i dont do this for all the doctors  yes  hes gonna need 40meqs of kcl  grab me when you get the results  you got it  his tv is broken so when you two start tagging each other  the least you can do is wake him up and let him watch  in my experience when two friends miss a chance like this  youve got exactly 48 hours to get the kiss  or one of you will overthink it ok shes gonna overthink it  then you end up permanently stuck in the friend zone  ill see ya  youre such a girl  nothing went on between me and elliot  good thing you still have your flower  that song is like a virus  im just a little lonely  i havent been hanging out with turk since hes been dating carla  first of all whos turk  and dont answer look if you have a medical question  im forced by hospital policy to answer you  however if you ask me about a personal problem  im going to start doing this  you seem unhappy  i like that  i cannot get that stupid song out of my head  its like a damn virus heres his chart his transfer note  hes haemodynamically stable consider him turfed to medicine  tman im gonna get my grub on  means hes gonna go eat   surgery went ok  it was cool  dude i got to close for the first time ever ever  the human body is so disgusting  not yours yours is stunning  we should celebrate tear it up like we used to just the two of us   what comes before part b  part a  thats right we used to tear it up  we should probably never do that again  that song is like a virus  no  dont let it be awkward  do something cute  cover her eyes and say guess who   guess who  i cant breathe  ok gang its time for rounds  lets see whos the weakest link  the weakest link  now then dr simotas  severe swelling of the lips in this patient might be an indication of what   angiooedema  well done sport  and what treatment would you recommend dr dorian  a combination of steroids and antihistamines  attaboy sport  what would you recommend the patient stay away from  dr reid   my first guess would be shellfish  right you are sweetheart  sweetheart  i could see what was going on in elliots head  right you are sweetheart   what do you want to watch  fletch   fletch it is  seen it  you havent seen it with us saying all the lines  im so lucky i met you  maybe next time her mom could come  you wont even know shes here  except she laughs at stupid stuff and that makes me laugh  its stupid because its so stupid   tonights still about us  whatever i dont care  turk you wanna go hang out in your room  i know dr kelso doesnt mean anything by it  and ok maybe i am kind of a sweetheart   im sleeping  but it just sounds so demeaning  youre not listening to a word im saying  its not like hes my grandpa or anything  anyway jd always tells me how much youve helped him  he obviously hasnt told you about my earflicking policy  this whole groovy guidance counsellor thing  you people seem to have working is a total fantasy  im not that guy you can go and ask anybody  now youve got to leave me alone or ill punish you  sweetheart is kind of innocuous  heres what youre gonna do go down there and confront kelso   really  absolutely  never mind that he is the chief of medicine  hell have a whole new level of respect for you   honestly  yes  you cant have sexist terms like that around here you go get im  this guy looks stable but i still wanna get an ekg  lets do cardiac enzymes  when you say sweetheart  and an aspirin  a lot of my work has become second nature  but it gives me too much time to think  look im surgery and youre medicine  this isnt college any more things have to change  i know relationships change i guess i thought yours and mine never would   whats going on with you man  we used to look out for each other  i dont feel you have my back any more   you really feel that way  yeah i do  you do great  ill get them from my locker you can write me a cheque  can you look at mr bidwell his temperatures starting to spike  sure  legally theres a huge difference  stitch a patient sew a sheet to him thats an accident  he tries getting up gurney collapses breaks his front teeth  thats a lawsuit  say it with me accident lawsuit  accident lawsuit  so what is it sweetheart  its the sweetheart thing it doesnt hit me right  im a doctor it seems sort of disrespectful  ive always called men sport and ladies sweetheart  but you call becky sport  well i am so sorry sport  its one of those bad habits ive developed  after working in the medical field for over 30 years   its hard to see a patient get worse instead of better  thats kind of the opposite of what were going for  he was fine last night  now hes diaphoretic in and out of consciousness maybe septic  we wont know till his blood works back  if hes septic they might have to reopen this guy  course theres also a chance he could die  ive seen this before gauze sponges  some young surgeon left something in this man  no i know the guy that closed hed never be that careless  excuse me sorry  has anyone seen my keys  no how about my wallet  anyone  ive never seen that before  turk  dr cox have you seen turk  turk  i was just dreaming about you  you were well we were  you got a few minutes  dont move  no dont move   have you seen turk  yeah i saw him  he just went out that door  turk  cant hear you   what  let me in  you love who  mr kavanaugh your arrhythmias much better  everything looks just great actually  you sound surprised  it has nothing to do with you  i had a runin with dr kelso so when he switched me to you  i thought it would be a difficult case  go on im listening  excuse me while i check on another penis patient  well hes a penis patient  turk  no i gotta talk to you  no  its nine up ok we just lost our fourth its your ball  its important  this is not a joke either this is real its surgical versus medical   your ball youre shirts  lets play  there it was everything was more important than me now  dont bring in the same crap the last kid did  suddenly i was so fed up  i decided to teach turk and todd a lesson on the court  you know once i warm up a little  jd im gonna show you  what the deal oh oh   throw the body out of him  oh  all right thats game whats so important  i was looking at bidwell  one second  i gotta go but you played a good game  i thought you sucked  go get your grub on   hey baby  you gotta be kidding  yes   sorry to bother you sir  well if it isnt sport  how are things did you see mr kavanaugh today  yes  yes i did dr kelso i just wanted to say well  as far as the sweetheart thing goes maybe i overreacted  are you sure i wouldnt want you to be the least bit uncomfortable  i have no idea what possessed me to say anything in the first place  youve got to leave me alone or ill punish you   absolutely no idea  super  then run along sweetheart  have you seen mr bidwells blood work  no it hasnt come back yet   ok have you seen turk  not since this morning  im sure youll see him before i do so  bambi are you giving me attitude  what if i am  you have to be a minority sidekick in a bad movie to pull that off   you know what i mean right  child you speak the truth  explain it to him  you do the hand then the finger then talk through the nose  then give a lot of attitude if youre not from there you dont understand   ok im gonna leave now  what  oh no you didnt where you going where you going  thank you very much   what  hi how are you  i have a quick legal question im just curious   what if hypothetically  oh god you killed somebody   no  someone else did   no no one killed anyone  maimed mutilated disfigured  im not sure there is a problem  im running tests doing everything i should  if you know something by not reporting it youre as culpable  anything you wanna tell me  why am i protecting turk when he cant give me five seconds   anything at all  tell him  no  scared the hell out of me  dr cox  im hoping theres another dr cox sat behind me  sending me to kelso like that im not sure what you were trying to teach me  the value and this is important of leaving me alone   theres more to it than that  no theres not  look i want you to go ahead and spread the word  ive had enough  the next whiny intern that comes to me for a cookie and a hug  i swear to aisha im going to hurt them  and you you onewoman freak show  take your blahblah to the blahblahologist  if youre so stupid as to confront the chief of medicine  over some quasioffensive endearment  then youve got to replace the captain of your brain ship  because hes drunk  youre right i need to learn to pick my battles thank you sir  youre welcome  and you say your husband hardly wore them  fantastic  the blood work came back  negative  but the guy looks like death  hi  what happened  theres no infection hes diabetic so when someone gave him insulin  when he wasnt eating he became hypoglycaemic  the only person that couldve given him insulin  me  i gave him insulin twice  hes fine bambi i gave him an amp of d50 and hes eating now  you should probably give him some orange juice in an hour   thank you so much you saved my ass  no it wasnt me   look turk  come on man i always got your back  i know  tell him how you feel without sounding like a girl  i miss you so much it hurts sometimes  ok   im gonna let that go for now  thank you  well find time to hang man were both swamped right now  and im hanging out with carla a lot  but if there was someone you were into youd be doing the same  crap  did nurse roberts sell you these   you dont wanna hear about my day  youre right kiss me   right now  we can wait three four seconds   but i just ate i feel gross  not gross pretty come here  jd can we just talk for a second  it never fails  oh yeah another one  howre you doing  went to high school with her  we worked at penguins yoghurt   i met her on a bus  shell come around  pretzel  thank you  the first few weeks have been so hard mentally physically emotionally  its like math camp all over again  not that ive been to math camp its an expression  i use it all the time   come on  anyway  choosing friendship over sex is the last thing any guy wants to hear  but you know what  this time it actually made sense to me  besides i challenge anyone to survive being an intern  without having a close group of friends to lean on  i cant believe you lost our bottle opener  yeah i know  i miss it so much it hurts sometimes   youre a bad person  dont judge me
