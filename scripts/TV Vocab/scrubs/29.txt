more about appearances  finish that thought quickly im not breaking my gait  substance style whats important coat not   too slow  i think you really got through to him  my god you hear like a bat  idiot i wish i had a guy that would stop me before i did something stupid  mistake  i dont know why hes an opera singer  listen tiny dancer i wouldnt be flapping my mouth  if id forgotten to get a blood culture on mr blair  and for the love of god do you at least remember what you were doing  the day they were passing out common sense  maybe you were running late  cos you couldnt find the right thong for those lowrider jeans you love  maybe you were bopping along to whatever boy band makes your heart race  and you just drove on by i dont know im just guessing  but one things sure you wound up at the dumbdumb store  and put about as much of that in the car as you could fit didnt you  and then i did something ive never done before  if you flipped the page youd see that i pan cultured him yesterday  but that would spoil the pleasure you take in pointing out peoples slipups  too bad buster brown im a resident now  im not gonna make the same intern mistakes i made last year  id appreciate if you wouldnt yell at me in front of my patient  buster brown  focus all energy on lip not quivering   hows the back sweetness  perfect  im sorry the last couple of nights i havent given you the turkeyjerky  but rest assured your man will be back in action before you know it  you take your time  hey big fella were together on a thyroidectomy this afternoon   could be a long one  oh thats great dr amato   how was that not funny  i dont know dude  you guys are getting to be like starsky and hutch  if starsky was a ventriloquist and hutch was a puppet  i would watch that why do you keep getting him  the other surgeons are busting my chops for skipping guys night out  dr amatos your punishment  no i enjoy needing you to lower me on the toilet in the morning  check that out  it looks innocent but elliot was late this morning  once youve been here a while you learn to read between the lines  mrs bumbry i wish i had better news but you didnt qualify  for the gi clinical trials so well keep plugging away  great so how was the sex with that guy  what guy i wasnt i  elliot i have other patients mrs bumbry needs a nap were all very busy  ive never done anything like this i just met him and slept with him  god i miss onenight stands  the best thing was since i knew it was just a fling  i wasnt afraid to ask him for exactly what i wanted   which was  shirt on lights off no talking  well you just be careful  you wouldnt believe how quickly a reputation can be made in this hospital  youre a bit of slut arent you  as soon as we get out of this sterile field  i am going to need the man who hit that to hit that  wait a minute im elliot reid  people listen up this rumour ends right now  she slept with him and she hardly knew him   does that happen a lot around here  not enough  that infection keeps hanging around  so i want to put you on a broader spectrum antibiotic intravenously  but im feeling better  im gonna tell you something my mom used to tell me when i was scared  in the case of sinus infection not responding to antibiotics  the recommended protocol is imipenem 500 mg ivq six hours  got me through a lot of hard times  i love it that mr blair trusted me  its one of the best feelings you can have as a doctor   hows it going  you cant wear that   you mean after labour day  you know what i mean  its a white coat anybody can wear a white coat  jerk  youre what we call a goner  im kidding theres nothing here  so mrs bumbry here has inflammatory bowel disease huh  and the drug theyre testing at the clinical trial could help  but she doesnt qualify you ok mrs bumbry  i liked bow wow when he was lil bow wow  rappers they grow up so fast  if youre gonna survive in medicine youve gotta accept rules are rules  anyone from that clinical trial around  hello hello this ladys supposed to be in this trial   ok  what the hell did you just do  when you speak of this and i know you will could i be shirtless  i think it would be even more impressive if i was shirtless  if youre a criminal even if you arent afraid of starsky  if a hutch puppet jumps out at you freeze sucker youre done for  does it have a real gun or puppet gun   puppet gun theyd sew it to his hand  ok id watch that  whats up fellas  i dont care what hospital you go to surgery is still a boys club  im just as cool as those guys  bye turk  tdog settle a medical debate for us  i think elliots got a modest rack at best  but my favourite attending here says when he was tuning in tokyo  the reception was excellent  elliots a friend of mine so i dont want to talk about that  so dr turk how is your back  my backs as swollen as elliots bigass breasts   i was paged  patients complaining of anosmia  anosmia  i always thought it was very funny that losing your sense of smell  was called anosmia  anosmia you know like schnozmia dont you find that very funny   he doesnt  im calling dr cox   nobody needs to call dr cox  this is only temporary right  of course its temporary could also be slightly more untemporary  you mean permanent  just when you think you have this place figured out  it finds a new way to get you  im waiting  unfortunately youve put us in somewhat of a legal bind  way to go ted good god man you couldnt scare a child  who would want to  do you have any idea how much money this hospital makes from that gi trial  into which you enrolled your patient  im gonna go ahead and guess  7  sometimes it comes right at you  keep smiling tough guy first im gonna  finish that thought bobcat cos im not breaking my gait   what are you looking at  nothing  sometimes it sneaks up on you  when she dated jd shed just wear a tshirt in the morning  so every time she reached up high for the cereal  everybody got two scoops of booty flakes  the two scoops they were packed with flavour you know what im saying  right right right  i told you i didnt want these antibiotics  when your first grandkid is born and you smell his head  call me and tell me how great it is  mr blair im sorry this happened  sometimes it hits you in places you didnt know you were vulnerable  yeah well you should be its your fault  no more silly medical mistakes huh nice going there newbie  damn  ted you seem different  i bought some relaxation tapes theyre working  a patients blaming me for losing his sense of smell  god you cut off someones nose  where is it do you have it on you youre disgusting  no i just gave him iv imipenem  kelsos gonna blame me just get rid of the nose  i dont have the nose maybe you should calm down   maybe you should calm down  my bad  imipenem  unlike gentamicin and tetracycline  imipenem has never been associated with anosmia  my god were ok  great thank you ted   its my birthday  what  nothing  and many more  elliot  come on its so tough to be a surgeon if youre not in youre out  dr turk down here  i saw you switched off on our exploratory laparotomy this afternoon  yeah its because i i had to   its because im short  youre not short  i know im the surgical assignment booby prize  but if my other choice is being in that boys club  id rather they made fun of me   what could they possibly make fun  stop it  its possible to be a good surgeon without playing their game   youre really short  i know  no dr murray i dont want any fries to go with this shake   i dont even know what that means  excuse me  you want to ask me how many ceiling tiles ive counted  maybe you want to call me a name like tramp ho or slesident  which is half slut half resident   no  then what is it noelle   i want to know where the gspot is  the what spot  for the 100th time you had nothing to do  with me getting involved in the bumbry case but for gods sake  the bigger problem facing us now  is how do we get you to stop annoying me  yeah im the problem cant you just for once stay out of your own way  cant you for once not be such a busybody  oh sore spot   what spot  sore spot  damn it  the next step is to find out what did cause mr blairs loss of smell   hey pal  excuse me doctor  oh no im not a doctor im a janitor  oh i just assumed because of the coat  right well janitors wear white coats around here too  you guys do a great job keeping this place clean   we thank you  no im a doctor  look at the books woman  is that a mans back  check out who i have assisting dr rumpelsurgeon  you know what his names dr amato  that girl you slept with her names dr reid   you should show them some respect  yeah says who  says me   dr kelso  carla  you look as good as i feel  mrs bumbrys 53  mrs who is what  the patient dr cox got into the gi clinical trial  she was disqualified because her chart said she was 63 and the cutoff is 55  but the genius who admitted her got her age wrong  shes actually a perfect candidate  and dr cox knew this   he knew the whole time  fandamntastic  you better do the heeltoe out of here  because you know im going to take this out on somebody  byebye  may i join you  by all means  knowing i was right and he was wrong i thought id enjoy this walk more  i couldnt help but empathise cos id been there and saw the signs  the shameful averted gaze  the nervous shifting  and of course the wild uncontrollable urination  im thrilled you approve but for the last time im up here im up here   you were wrong i was right  i beg your pardon  anosmia isnt a sideeffect of iv imipenem  plus mr blair had nasal polypectomies and septoplasty  and his loss of smell is caused by manipulation of his sinuses  and the infection so i didnt make a mistake  and you were wrong when you said nice going newbie  here youve put me in a tough situation  i cant honestly decide whether to say duh or doy  or a very sarcastic oh really my god fiona  i know it wasnt your fault the patient probably knows  but he seemed a little distraught  maybe being able to blame somebody for a second might make him feel better  and i know maybe its me but doesnt that seem like something  that goes along with wearing that fancy white coat  it does doesnt it   kinda  im so proud of you put it there  the tarantula  that girl asked me to give her my top ten sexual positions  and after the two that i knew i started naming insects  that really sucks im sorry  im not sure i mean i was mad at you at first  but its actually kind of empowering to have this persona this identity  im not just some nameless faceless white doctor  im elliot reid tramp  well thats great if youre happy im happy  the weird thing is she said shed already tried stink bug  i still dont know why i was desperate for everyone to know it wasnt my fault  dr cox dr kelso has something he wants to say to you  so i hear there was an age mixup that i was unaware of  and anyway   youre ok  im sorry  i guess it comes down to how we want to be seen by other people  i proud of you robert put her there  i think its important you understand i had no idea how old that patient was  for the record she couldve been 170 i still wouldve stuck her in that trial  so fast itd make your teeth fall out all over again   thats perfect  i would too  some people want to be seen as the rebel  some people just want to be seen period  some people have limits on how far theyll go to protect their image   dr turk i need you down here  coming  when i stopped worrying how other people saw me i started to look better  mr blair i just wanted to say again that i made a mistake and im sorry   its all right  good luck  come on baby lets see if we can find you a ride  laverne  careful  so were done with the coats it was a fun day though wasnt it  see you tomorrow  maybe tomorrow ill get a bad haircut and push round a mop all day  i know you dont have to do it ok  mistake  yeah
