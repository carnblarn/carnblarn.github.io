to hit that   no  yeah  shes just a friend  its healthy hanging out with a girl without the ultimate goal being sex   you know  im not following  creepy i had a runin with that nurse carla  she forgot to check the stats on a patient and gave me attitude  did you tell on her   whos responsible for this  she is  i dont remember why do you assume it was my fault  itd be a good point except elliot puts her foot in her mouth  a lot she cant really seem to stop  just because i occasionally say something stupid doesnt mean  i go doortodoor annoying people like some crazed jehovahs witness   youre not

youre the chief of medicine  is there a special way to communicate with nursing staff  sugar wont work theyre already so sweet  now listen dr whateverthehellyournameis  you tattled yesterday i

great day ladies  i hate this place  dr cox i got wills ct results back  no cancer so what shall i tell him  id open with that  hes headed down such a bad road maybe we could talk to him  when you have a mentor you understand the meaning behind their words   you do whatever you want  means great idea  im just happy you havent messed up yet today  means youre really coming along as a doctor   dont ever touch me  means dont ever touch him  just thought it was a nice moment   i dont wanna  come on  carla i shouldnt have told dr kelso on you  no you shouldnt have  comfortable silences  but thank you for apologising  good   i wanna make one thing clear  nothing needs to be clear  i still think you were in the wrong  checking orthostatics is your job i need to know youll take care of it  thats all im saying  there all better  as of now you have no signs of cancer  who rules will rules  this isnt great news  are you sure thats how it first hit me  youre on a slippery slope  i had to scare him but i sensed hed heard it before  part of being a doctor is your ability to improvise  right now the one thing i want you to think about  how would you like to sound like this  let me see   this is so cool  no its not   biddy biddy biddy  its not a toy  would you like to play a game  sometimes if all you have is old words  all you can do is hope they say something new  look man youre a great patient  i like you enough to hope i never see you again  but if you keep smoking youll be back here  i bet my own life on that  dr reid to room 402 then down to 201 then back up to room 403  im nervous man  im your wing man i will not leave your side   hey baby  keep moving frat boy   come on out with it  dont rush me  i mean  you shouldnt be impatient with the opportunity of a lifetime  im gonna sit down because youre so sexy my knees are weak  really  dr cox i know im being annoying  but im getting used to talking to patients  this is why i became a doctor right  i heard i know im being annoying and then white noise  will i got him to quit smoking  for ever no last one the last ones are better than sex  trust me ive had 1000 of them  done forever he swore to me i reached him i reached him  youre having a big day there susan  private party  gotta get right back on the horse   dr cox about will  not now  ive a 10minute break and my soap is on  hey skeech if you go ahead and change the channels  i swear ill suture your hands together   right so with will  this woman is just fantastic  the breasts are probably fake but by god those tears are real  time for a bold move  how are we gonna fix this will thing  do you know what youve just done  you just lost all lapdog privileges   excuse me  no more walkies no more treats  no more following me around   im not your lapdog  you back there  what do we do with lapdogs who cant behave in the house  make them stay outside  you have five seconds to get out of this room  or im gonna start whacking you on the nose with this  dont laugh this isnt a joke get out   but i was thinking  go  what do you want to watch   days of our lives  attaboy  come in  he smells the food  move your butt  peace offering  i know i dont always make the best first impression  or second for that matter  id like us to be friends i thought i could get to know you a bit better  see what youre about  for instance when did you meet morgan freeman  thats my mom  i like her freckles  rowdy no  i cant figure out why dr cox tore me a new one today  enough already hes a jerk   hes a jerk  hes a jerk   hes a jerk  youre a jerk  hes just dr cox hes always like that  who really knows him who does he hang out with   no one  that must be lonely  take two turks as needed apply to sensitive areas  who wrote this  whassup  come on carla give me one good reason why you wont go out with me  youre a surgeon so you got the god complex  the married to the job thing  youre cute but youre very aware of it  youve no idea what im like so your feelings for me come from down there  but most of all im looking for the real thing  youre nothing but a little boy whos not used to being told no  so theres a bunch of reasons pick your favourite  id go with the god complex  but its hard to choose theyre all so good  a hospital is a tricky place  its very cliquey and you have to watch what you say  its a lot like high school  if i didnt have somewhere else to be  i would have gone and sat with her  but tonight theres somebody else i have to take care of  i know watching will kill himself hurts you too  its harder if you have no one to talk with  so i figured id pick up a few cold ones right  and you and i well talk it out well just break the whole thing down  right what do you say to that  everyone keeps ignoring me im like a plague around here  dont look at me when youre talking  dr reid i just wanted to say youre out of my doghouse  that was a great catch on that patient with meningococcus  that actually wasnt me carla noticed the rash on his legs  you could have been back into my good graces  and instead you passed the credit on to a nurse  how noble i tell you what ill get the cafeteria staff to write  was it worth it on a big cake for you  station this is the nurses station   do you think ive damaged ligaments  i dont care  now can i count on you to never drop by here again  or shall i just move  you cant leave a place with this much warmth  i especially love this shelf filled with photos of your friends and family  if he comes at you just try and roll out the door  actually you have a point  i guess watching the game by yourself with a scotch  isnt really the only way to watch a game  its just that ive always thought of needing people as a sign of weakness   its not  well then  would you stay and watch the game with me  maybe have a slice of pizza   of course i will  i can braid your hair  i know the couch isnt very deep but we could move the back cushion  and spoon  hey you guys what do you say beer and chips in the back  just ignore them  tell me the answer to this question  do you want to be the big spoon or the little spoon  kelso didnt ask her she gave you full credit  i dont care too little too late plus i know why youre really here  so im gonna plop myself right here in the vip section  so you can give me what you got  i was gonna tell you how i busted jds chops the other day  for wanting to be friends with a girl  and now i find it so amazing to see how strong you are  how well you carry yourself  how id give anything to wake up and watch you read the paper  but instead i think you should hop off your broom  remember what it was like when you first started here  and give elliot a break because she may be a chore but she is a good person  and your ass is especially fine today  pick me up tomorrow at seven  shes not the only one who can do a speech i can do a speech  return that umbrella to me at the hospital not here is that clear  and newbie   know what your problem is  my bones hurt  you were gonna rescue me from loneliness with a 3 sixpack of light beer  it turns out we cant save people from themselves  we just treat em treat that kid with a respiratory problem  and when he comes back with cancer go ahead and treat that  thanks for the pickmeup  smokers drinkers druggies fatties whatever  if you keep living and dying on whether or not a person changes well  youre not gonna make it as a doctor  now come here and give me a hug its ok come here  get outta here  take this piss water with you its embarrassing   ill drink it  ill take the beer youll beat it   you apologise  no i dont wanna  ok come on just do it really fast like a bandaid  i wrote out the pharmacy renewals on all your patients  great you know what else would be helpful  the one thing we never stop looking for is acceptance   thank you carla  youre welcome  acceptance of our own shortcomings   so whens the baby due  what baby  acceptance that some things are gonna be what theyre gonna be  this is a strange resort the wheelchair service is great  but that suite i rented there was another person in it   and the bellhop gave me an enema  yeah hes new here  so   anything you wanna say  you know it all man  still i hated will a little  cos i looked at people who are important to me  in terms of what will probably kill them  heart disease  liver disease  somebody choking her  i dont know  probably stress   say anything else to him  no  but you wanted to   you told me not to  would you be a man  stick to your convictions or youll never make it as a doctor  i cant believe your head exploded  if it does youll never make it as a doctor  i mean come on you look ridiculous
