                as a doctor you need to be prepared for anything  heart attacks drug overdoses gunshot wounds  but one thing you cant prepare for  is what happens after you break up with a coworker   watch where youre walking  you watch where youre walking  get the last word in   you watch where youre walking  you watch where youre walking  try as hard as you can to avoid them youre bound to run into em one day  and the next day  and the next day   you dont even play sports  this helps me to relieve stress  feel better  i do now   girl problems  howd you know  you look like you got problems youre a girl  hence girl problems watch your nails  the only positive is that a hospitals like one big family  so if one relationship ends there are others around you can rely on   dr cox i was

ever pull it off  i will be back here to destroy this place  i used to like the silver surfer   hang ten hang  get in here  after a while you get used to dr coxs rants  and the lab tech is nowhere to be found  so i cant get that tox screen i was looking for  what do you say we write him a friendly note  dear  incompetent  dumbass  the truth is dr cox isnt really angry hes just amusing himself  maybe hes a little angry  we didnt need those  so all done  he broke his pencil  turk youll be happy you picked me to cowrite this study  hell yeah i thought wed start off by having a couple of beers  i got all the info on peripheral vascular disease  highlighted passages and coded them  to correspond with the outline in your packet  but i dont have a packet  look at that turks packet   so you did

came across mr rices advance directive  and he has a few requests he would like us to honour  lets see blinds open thats done  incense burning  close enough glad you called  dr kelso he also wants to hear poisons talk dirty to me once a day  he wants to hear whose what  poison its a heavy metal band  like mtley cre and winger  my son was a bit of a headbanger   ill get a tape deck in here  nurse espinosa thats not necessary   its just one song  it starts out as just one song  but then half of the hospital staff  is piercing their genitalia and fornicating in the back of vans  unless a family member enforces the directive  we dont have to do anything  now will you do me a favour  and just forget about it sweetheart  of course  can you help me locate one of his family members  i could try to locate one through some legal channels but im really swamped  i love your worry lines theyre adorable  theyre like sexy little forehead smiles  careful ive been hurt before  you wont believe what happened yesterday  dr cox went ballistic and destroyed an entire lab room  broken computers chairs through windows shattered beakers  beakers how is this is not good gossip  jd he does this every

honest to god i got nothing im cooked  you owe me 53  i think i left my wallet in my other onesie  the bartender let you skip out on the tab  he said i could pay him back by giving him a physical  which is scary because i never said i was a doctor  i warned you about getting caught up in dr coxs wake   does he listen  youd think so with those ears  uncalled for  its different he showed up at my place  he showed up at my house   showed up at my mamas  ruined my wedding  i know you think hes gonna shake this off  but i connected with the guy and there is no way  hell walk in with a big smile

all franklyn there was no crying  say it   no crying  good boy  and you should give some thought  to purchasing some nonbunching panties  they give you the extra support  while protecting against those lines underneath your scrubs   i get it im a girl  franklyn you heard it say it   hes a girl  good boy  you cant play with peoples emotions cos you feel like it  ok newbie im now going to give you an opportunity  to get out of here before i grab you by your ankles  and redecorate franklyns lab  please go  were back the clique is back together  that is what im talkin about shall we  lets do

proxy for his uncles living will  what a happy coincidence  you showing up out of the clear blue sky   oh god  youre ok  so exactly how much is my uncle leaving me can i ask that  this isnt about his assets  this is about executing his last living requests  so no money at all  not a dime kiddo  i cant tell you how glad we are  to put all this tomfoolery to rest  once and for all cup of coffee

with problems the way emotionally healthy people do  well hold on a second there rainbow  this just off the news wire youre not licensed to comment  on how people deal with their emotions   i beg to differ  well at least i let mine go you  if you ever were able to actually  release all the tensions that are bottled up inside of you  what would that look like how would that go  how you like me now bitch  maybe i just dont have anything bottled up  what happened to that teacher you were prattling on about   passed away  croaksville thats what i thought  what did you do when you found out that hed died   i made a joke  i sure hope it was a good one  heres the inside scoop lifes hard enough  and theres no way you can survive in a dump like this  unless you find a way to get your emotions out  fact  well i let my emotions out ill show you some of this  franklyn i am so sorry  wanna wear my stethoscope  the cool thing about this movie is that this could really happen  the russians invading or c thomas howell being a tough guy  both  wolverines why is she always here  were working on my study  every time i come here im gonna see him  just get someone else to do this project with you  maybe the reason why i asked you to work with me  is because it would force you to see each other  i dont want to get back together with him  im not saying that you made a terrible couple  its just that i like you you know  i think youre a cool person  it doesnt matter about me and jd   you and i can still hang out  no  it cant be that way and you know it  cos thats my best friend  so either you can try and fix it or   this sucks  yeah  and baby well be  at the drivein  in the old mans ford  behind the bushes  till im screaming for more  down the basement  lock the cellar door  and baby  talk
