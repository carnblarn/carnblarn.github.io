the courage to tell your colleague dr dorian  youre still crazy about him im gonna do it for you  thats what friends do  and finally perry you are not gonna believe what happened  the first time i met your protg here  no  i slept with him and it was good  bye  call it wishful thinking but i couldnt shake this feeling  that this was nothing more than a very very bad dream   good morning tiger  of course ive been wrong before  you let a woman kick you out of your bed  why are you so cranky in the mornings  this is unacceptable you said wed sleep head to foot  the naughty bits are still in the middle  but with the head to foot alignment they cant lock in   could you be more homophobic  im not  ready to go  morning boy  i cant remember the last time i was in this foul a mood   rowdy no  is

 do you actually think thats funny  yeah  good god thats cold  life in a hospital is made up of highs and lows  for instance my spare pair of scrubs doesnt match  but i put my underwear in the microwave to dry them off and they feel good   what are you smiling at  can i have mr buckleys chart  no problem i keep it right down there in the get it yourself file  bob ive been thinking about all the times youve manipulated me  and toyed with me and well i cant help but recall that childrens fable  about the race between the tortoise  and the painintheass chief of medicine that everybody hates  the chief of medicine that everybody hates  kept running in front of the tortoise and taunting him but at the end  oh gosh im sure you remember what happened  the tortoise bit clean through the chief of medicines calf muscle  dragged him to the ground where he and the other turtles devoured him alive  there on the racetrack  its a disturbing childrens book bob i know  but its one thats stuck with me nonetheless  i beg your pardon  thats the sound of all the bees in your bonnet  and even though i could give a rats ass i still think its a pretty sound  and just like that it was my turn to face the music  steady now be brave dont cry   good morning  what the hell  dr dorian   here you go whizz kid  is that my new nickname  i thought people would call me that in high school when i was in the wiz  it was a hip version of the wizard of o z  nipsey russell played the tin man  remember that no  kids can be mean and everyone just started calling me dorothy  high school was hard  im sorry sport i was thinking about soup  now mr zerbo was admitted with a high fever and suspected meningitis  but the head ct and the lumbar puncture came back negative  i have a full patient load  you cant drop this guy on me and expect me to make him a priority  want me to say tadah so it seems more like a trick  mr zerbo is a major hospital benefactor  and by golly its a lot harder to write a big fat cheque if youre dead  neurology rheumatology haematology  hes been to every service in the hospital what shall i do   i hope its navy bean today  dr kelso  gee sport stop whining find out whats wrong with him and treat it  or you can be damn sure im gonna give you something to whine about  fine after all im the whizz kid  you are now  ladies now that the todd is a resident  he wants to clear

is why im sorry   my boys got mad apologizing skills  todd not now  you cant point out the obvious you have to go deeper  todd if you say thats what she said i will brain you  now come on baby connect with me why am i really upset  im gonna stick with violation of trust final answer  yeah right  you know i got half a mind to ask her out  too soon  well thanks for the loaners chet  dont stain em  once youre a resident you get a decent locker  still its a coed room so if you need to change  you do it fast  that was like some sort of record or something  hello  sorry mom its gotten awkward with this guy i was seeing  and yes mom yay im straight  look i dont know what to do every time i see him i get so embarrassed  and lonely and mortified and i guess i was hoping that you could  about 115 pounds  phenphen kills people mom  because im a doctor thats how i know   you look pretty  dont even start   you look horrible  i look fantastic  and thats starting i said not to start laverne  thats what she said  thats dont start in spanish  i planned to avoid dr cox all day but i needed his help  i have this patient mr zerbo i cant quite  maybe he just decided to let the whole exwife thing go   autoimmune serologies  negative  then again maybe hes letting me stew for a while   bone marrow biopsy  negative  what kind of man tortures people like this  fraid you got yourself a toughie  fine im sorry i slept with your exwife  i think ill sit back down  it was an accident  look first of all its not like you tripped and fell into her  and then out of her and then into her again  and second you know i dont want to talk about this  i dont want to know where you did it or even how it was  a little scary sorry jitters  here come the fireworks  look i know you didnt have any idea who she was  and understand why you were too nervous to tell me  what do you say we leave it at that i forgive you you are forgiven  ok   cool  damn  hospitals arent as big as you think eventually you run into everyone  hey elliot  im not hiding i was just looking for my you know the  i was looking for my dignity   did you find it  no  i mustve left it at college  oh for gods sakes would you throw her a rope  i have no idea how to treat this patient help me out  now shes in a really awkward place so just be sensitive   i think we should sex each other  im sorry  just hear me out our relationship ended so quickly maybe too quickly  and now theres these feelings floating around  and i feel like well always regret it if we dont see if they lead somewhere  what do you think  i cant believe how weird it feels to be back here again  yeah but it seems so right  if carlas so mad why doesnt she just crash at her own place  oh she is back at her place  what are you talking about willis  thats pretty funny we should make that one of our things  thats stupid  i think id really panic if she went back to her place  jd this sucks  yeah you know whats weird though dr cox and i are pretty vegan kosher   he hasnt yelled at you  no  this guy screamed on you for 20 minutes for dropping a thermometer  and hasnt raised his voice about you and his exwife   uhuh  i dont get that guy  and thats when i realised something   where you been i paged you twice  i mustve misplaced my pager  the reason dr cox wasnt yelling at me like he used to  you probably ought to try and find that  he didnt care about me any more  yeah thats a leaky oring  i can fix her but i dont got the parts in stock  we need an oring down there  thats entertainment  standing there i couldnt help thinking about the way things used to be  dont forget felicia if you  son you really ought to buy that thing dinner first  it wasnt just me and dr cox who werent getting along  everyone was just drifting through the halls  each one of us acting like the others didnt exist  thats when i decided to get proactive and i knew just where to start  what the bejesus   hello boys  what the hell are you doing  this is how the todd gets his selfesteem on  do these help  uncool you look totally hot mirror todd  i think we should talk about the sexual tension  there is no sexual tension ok  just go ahead and look before your neck snaps   awesome  jd the problem is this place  when we broke up i had to see you the next day and the next day  i never got any distance from the relationship i never got to move on  and the sexual tension  oh my god you have no idea what you sound like do you  jd jd check it  rat tail  you dont wanna play  too slow what now mr smart guy  that is so not funny  wet butt   it gets better  is it starting to burn  i would think so hey dont touch your eyes  ok right back on the horse   thank you all for agreeing to talk  you paged us here  i think there are simple solutions   dr cox youre angry with me  no im not   youre in love with carla  hes not   i am  youre starting again  youre mad turk didnt trust you enough to say  see trust woman   turk is sorry  not any more   you thought he was a threat  im a threat   youre not in love you idealise me  stay focused  youre mad cos im scared of losing you   yes because were stronger than that  apparently not  be glad i never took you for granted silly woman   refrain from namecalling  oprahs right   lay off  youre still in love with your ex  thats it ive killed for much less than that  and ill do it again unless you all shut up now and i mean now  glad we did this  im going out for mexican food tonight ill see you in bed my friend  oh my god rounds  rounds started five minutes ago and i totally forgot about mr zerbo  oh my god  are you planning on making this worth my while  dr dorian step up to the mike and tell the entire gang  how you ended up treating mr zerbo  think whizz kid think  the hell with it  sir i did nothing  is this because of the same kid as before   you did nothing  nothing at all   great job sport  huh  when a patient gets bounced from ward to ward  theres a chance a high fever could be sustained or even caused  by the constant stream of antibiotics  its called drug fever and its a good catch by dr dorian  next patient mush people mush  thank you doctor  oh no problem  its funny i guess sometimes when you do nothing at all  things just have a way of fixing themselves  thatll do it   i have other songs  yeah you do  do you know how i know that this is yours farrah  someone found it next to a can of fresca  and a dogeared copy of teen people magazine  anyway long story short the incident gave me a bangup idea  because you see ive got tomorrow off  so im gonna be on my couch sipping scotch and paging you every 20 seconds  if you dont answer every one ill shove this so far down your throat  its gonna make you take a tinkle every time it goes off  big fun right  youre gonna need this  let it come let it  its good to be home  sort of
