you know what mrs tanner  just until samantha blows out her candles  what are you gonna wish for   a bike  nope   a doll house  nope  how about the ability to make quick decisions   nope  how about

come on lets go   candles are still lit  ok  here we go blow  i increased the heparin to 1500 units per hour  does that sound like enough  should be  speaking of heparin have you slept with turk yet   what  im sorry  too personal  i like to wait i like a guy to want it so bad  he thinks he isnt gonna get it ever  when hes lost the will to live i jump him   so how long does that take  a month maybe two  what about you  i like to use sex as an icebreaker  and hows that working out for you  i guess i dont have what you would call high selfesteem   let me know when you find the hernia  you got it   were so lost  we are not lost   go left here  its right  you passed his coopers ligament   stop and ask for directions  you wanna drive  cos i will pull over and let you drive this thing  wait a second go back to where you just were  what is that  her osats in the 80s and take a look at her heart rate  shoot  thats basically it your kidneys arent responding to medication any more  were gonna have to start you on dialysis  im not a big fan of dialysis  we dont really have a choice  actually i do have a choice  certain things you never expect people to say  i think im ready to die  ive got a ton of bricks for dr dorian  can i get that pen back  youre gonna have to shut your mouth at some point  sweetie im 74 years old im ready to go  with dialysis you could live another 80 or 90 years  youre being a little irrational   no im not  everybody dies some time  no they dont  sir were really lucky we found the lymphoma when we did  of course ill wait till you get here before i tell david  see you soon  i hope youre not using that phone to make a personal call  no that was david morrisons father hes a patient of mine a good kid  he sounds terrific you two are becoming best pals huh  what we should do is the three of us play a game of stick ball  all we need is a stick a ball and a pocket full of dreams  or we could take turns bowling your patient  down the hallways of my hospital   i can explain  spare me  spare you thats good sir cos of the bowling thing   youre not making a joke  not at the moment  hes a good kid and he needed a friend  your patients dont need friends they need a doctor  her bps dropping maybe its time to push thrombolytics   what would you do  thats way out of my league  she seems to be decompensating but thrombolytics scare me  a lot of times the patient bleeds out  she needs to know whats going on  ill be right back   she doesnt want dialysis  but what does that mean  if she declines dialysis there is no ethical dilemma  but what about our duty to do everything  what about our duty  look this has nothing to do with the patient  this is all about you you are afraid of death  and you cant be youre in medicine  you gotta accept that everything we do here everything  is a stall  were just trying to keep the game going thats it  but ultimately it always ends up the same way   i win  where i dont see  here diagonally  pretty sneaky death  hope i helped  dr kelso came down on you huh  yeah but hes got a point this is a hospital  its not a playground  well if it isnt the medulla oblongata thats about 50 points there  i won ill just take your fruit cup and be on my way  i talked to my dad today   hes coming out  cool  and that nurse came by to shave me again   i didnt tell her to do that  you didnt  no i think shes got a crush on you   come on dude whats going on  ok heres the deal  shes telling her family  theres nothing that could make me go in there right now   you didnt tell them did you  it didnt come up  look they dont need that burden  and theyd give me reasons to change my mind  speaking of which i took the liberty of jotting down  a few things i think everybody should do at least once in their life  ok number one eat a sausage and pepper hoagie from enricos  ive done that  number two go to asia  ill take that as a yes  and ill also check off learn a foreign language  what happened to ill be right back  i cant believe i started to think id been wrong about you  that woman needs her doctor to tell her something anything and you run away  are you even gonna look at me  ive been deciding what drink to get  trying to choose between cherry soda and ginger ale and you know what  its a tossup either way i get a cold drink  it would be impossible for me to kill someone with this decision but  i still cant make it  i think im in trouble here  look  these kinds of decisions arent easy for anyone  if its any consolation one of the reasons i never liked you  is youre already better than most of the doctors that come here  i kinda liked being the only smart strong chick in the joint  you sort of just complimented me  a little bit  ok im gonna have a ginger ale  good start  that clot isnt going anywhere on its own so lets push the thrombolytics  ok  here we go  go to the top of the eiffel tower   done  go to the top of the meiffel tower   now youre making stuff up  no im not its right here  listen dr dorian  there is not one thing i regret as i lay here right now  im ready i really am   you have had an amazing life  good now we agree  arent there other patients you need to be seeing  me no ive been off for two hours  so with your precious free time youve been talking to an old lady  what about your list how many have you done  for that matter how many times have you sat on the grass and done nothing  you need to start taking some time for yourself  promise me youll do that   i will  good  now get outta here go on  i just wanna check out a few things before i get going  are you ok   im scared  come here  come here  youre ok youll be just fine  not to worry  i wanted you to know she went very peacefully  i know you did everything you could for my son  i cant tell you how glad i am he had a friend here with him  dont secondguess yourself you made the right call  you did  i know  your mothers kidney  they say one out of every three patients admitted will die here  but some days the odds are worse than that  im really sorry  and on days like that the best you can hope for  is that you took something from it  hey im turk  anything  bps 120 over 80 lets keep it that way  anything at all  even if its just taking the time to lie on the grass  and think about all the things you still have left to do
