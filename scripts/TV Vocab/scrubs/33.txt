ass  heres the newsflash there skeech it was a fluke   ill do it again  all right fair enough  heres your chance two identical patients  i say we divide em up just like in the parent trap  one goes with the sexy freewheeling bachelor dad hello  the other goes with the neurotic  sexuallyrepressed mom just you all over  and i checked tonights tv listings  there is no special on that disease  so

ecstatic nine months ago  i told you you had eight months to live remember   i vaguely recall that  yeah of course you do  that is totally my fault who knew we could cure cancer  i prepared myself you

probably seems insensitive to you  sweetheart you dont have to explain yourself to me  but get your story straight when you come facetoface with jesus  the chart for dr coxs ttp patient  i could look and see but im not that insecure about my  i will get it  yes hes doing the exact same thing  when you work in a hospital and things are going well  you should enjoy it because around every corner  theres something waiting to take it all away  dr reid i need to talk to you about your patient mr bragin  isnt it great hes cancerfree  yay hes suing you for malpractice  its ok relax i told him how i felt  he listened and nobody got hurt its fine  which one of you twos been messing with my business  of course every once in a while  you manage to get away scotfree  hey dr cox  youll be happy to know that i did everything for my patient  that you did for yours  my god i care so little i almost passed out  hey ace your ttp patient coded i pronounced him   he died  i certainly hope so  otherwise that autopsys going to be a bitch   boy thats tough  what  id talk you through this but i gotta go check on my patient  you see hes still alive  oh no  how the hell did my patient die  you started corticosteroids so did i  you did plasmapheresis so did i  you yelled at mark the orderly so did i  hey mark   see hes pissed  because his name is frank  now as far as your patients concerned  newbie im afraid you forgot a very important thing  for whatever reason i was fed up  ive been working my ass off here for the last year and a half  and the last thing i need  is another one of your condescending speeches  where you spoonfeed me some lesson and call me a girls name  have it your way there carol cos im out   good luck everyone  go ahead walk away  because im not gonna obsess about this  can you put a rush on this autopsy i gotta figure this out  you got some crumbs in his hair  a lawsuit so youre suing me because youre not dying  i didnt want to face my mortality you forced me to  now i cant earn any money because my job seems trivial  i cant be in a relationship cos whats the point  heres the topper remember my judgmental father  i hadnt spoken to in 15 years  good news doc weve patched things up  guess whos coming over saturday to watch the game  and tell me what a jerk i am  you asked how much time you had left   you said id be dead by now  youre not so sue me   i am  it was a figure of speech  and your dad was right about you   you tell him yourself  hey assface  hiya pops  excuse me maam jordan  carla has something shed like to tell you carla  i didnt mean to upset you  even though everything i said was true and you know it  baby that is a godawful apology just godawful  its cos shes not really sorry honey i know your type  its easy to see other peoples problems  from up there on your pedestal  but you better be careful cos if you fall off  and have to walk around down here with the rest of us  you might catch a glimpse of yourself in a mirror  or the surface of a pond your boyfriends gigantic shiny head  and trust me youre not gonna like what you see  my heads not  a little help here  im sorry kid i didnt see anything unusual  couldnt he have bled out or had an mi  i dont know i didnt look for any of those basic things  because im horrible at my job  dr walch murder she wrote  you caught me im checking on my patient   how is that guy doing  not great  what in the hell is going on in here  the amnio triggered premature labour  shes only 24 weeks cut it out right now   is he yelling at me  yes he is  im gonna give you a shot of terbutaline  and you know what else he said i had a fat ass before  the nice kind  look i dont get a lot of women in here  whats your honest opinion of these drapes  theyre fine ted but im getting sued  youre right youre right youre right   now by fine  ted   just time to calm down now  im fine  actually i was talking to myself  now you havent discussed the lawsuit with mr bragin have you  a lawsuit  it sort of came up yeah  oh god tell me you didnt antagonize him   so sue me  or admit fault  that is totally my fault  oh come on a good lawyer couldnt win this case  new drapes theyre awful  dr kelso why does everything keep happening to me  take a breath dr reid  in and out thats it thats it  now you went to four years of college  and four years of medical school  so i can safely presume that you are at least eight  my god little girl  grow up and say howdo to the world of modern medicine  my god ive been sued four times   ten times  come on ted lets go  lets go  i think you should go in there and apologize  no i didnt say anything that wasnt true  i just wanna see if shes ok  shes fine  would you please have the nurse covering jordan  page me the moment she wakes up   sure  thank you  hey dr cox im sorry  i was frustrated before so now im here  why dont you tell me what i forgot   can i really  sure hit me   how about go to hell shakira  what  now youve decided youre ready to listen how does it work  gonna pull a string on my back step right up and give it a tug  but i bet it keeps coming up go to hell shakira  why do you always have to be like that  i try harder than anyone and you never give me any credit  you listen to me  im not doing this because i get my jollies being your mentor  and im not doing it so years from now i can say  boy i knew him when  im doing it because if i dont people would die  thanks for your help  you know what mr bragin i figured something out   that damn nurse broke my bed  thats just it  you blame everyone else for anything that goes wrong like this  the nurse didnt break your bed you just press this button  all right it is broken  if you hate your job switch careers  if you cant get a relationship you have problems  and i know im right im the same  i blame my parents for not preparing me  this hospital for taking up all of my time  im even blaming you for jeopardizing my future  but you know what its time for me to grow up  and start holding myself accountable   and im doing it  good for you  youre still suing me arent you  yeah but i feel like now youll be able to handle it  you know what were just gonna have to get him fixed  good news is he doesnt need to go to a vet  we could just pop these things right off  yes baby you have got to tell jd  because he is not gonna believe it  jordan was right about me  im insecure and i judge people to cover up for it  even right now all i can think about  is to tell you youre a surgeon now  and you have to start acting like an adult  you had to say all of that  you dont listen unless people spell it out for you   oh my god i cant stop  baby  maybe its something you need to work on  i promise you i will never ever tell you what to do ever again  yeah you will but with me its ok because i love you  besides i barely listen anyway  cmon rowdy lets go boy lets head up the fourth floor  whoa whoa boy  slow down  as i sat there searching for answers about my patient  i realized that i still needed dr cox  its hard to face a harsh truth about yourself  the only thing you can do is try to take positive steps  unfortunately its hard to take positive steps  when youve burned the bridge you need to walk across  it was luck   what  the thing that you forgot  turns out whatever you know about medicine  ultimately luck or fate or god  or who knows what is always gonna end up  playing a much bigger role than you and i ever will  it was lucky you were watching that show the other night  and it was unlucky that your patient went the other way  even though you did everything right  and for the record you did  i was looking over your shoulder every step of the way   thanks  it wasnt a favour newbie  it was my job
