whose first name is tracy  i started thinking about your urine and how you stay wellhydrated  which is why your pee is lighter than most peoples  and the sample with your name on was bright yellow  and the other tracy is not much of a water drinker  which is why i think her skin looks so pasty  get to the point  youre not pregnant the lab tech just switched the samples  youre killin me  hey

 yeah  check mr sullivans tests again  ok  how cool was that  why so sad bambi  because so far no ones screwed up  the clerk didnt make a mistake or the lab technician  maybe im just an idiot i dont

you want to touch one  i stand corrected  youre my best friends girlfriend  so your instinct is to pass on this fantastic onetime offer   im afraid so  im up here bambi  oh sorry  with ben its one of two things  either your instincts are right or your brain  is trying to protect you from something  you have pretty good instincts trust them  what am i supposed to do though  you know theres only one more person to talk to  the haematopathologist  hello   call me dr bobb  you go by your first name   nope first names fred  fred bobb  what can i do you for  hi i was hoping that you could recheck ben
