                before i go into that building and start my day  i always like to take a quiet moment to prepare myself  well i guess it would be nice if i could touch your body  not you sir  i know not everybody has got a body like you  dude whats the rule about white boys dancing in public  not allowed unless youre gay  morning steven  fine then ill just put on something that rocks  as a thirdyear resident you know everyone so well you can practically speak for them  for instance  remember no more dancing  pow  good morning bambi sign this please  who you eyeballing tough guy  and of course  well zsa zsa now youve put me in quite the pickle you see  with those earphones on you cant hear me but  the odds are highly against you cracking open that yapper and annoying me today  so what to do what to do what to do ahh hell  stop addressing me as dr cox in front of your patients  when they find out my actual name they tend to page me with questions  when they realize just exactly how inept you really are oh and as  an added safety measure from now on ill only be responding  to doc doctor ceasar or the big cheese and noooo  im _not_ joking not _now_  not ever  see things never really change around here  surgical and medical still play each other in basketball  im gonna toast you so bad your momma aint even gonna recognize you  yeah well i heard that your sister started drinking again  im still not great at smacktalk  so its not supposed to be true  no ohhh let it pour big guy  and elliot was still searching for something to turn things around for her  oh my god isnt she beautiful i mean this car  has totally maxed out my credit but my selfesteems been so low lately  that i think its worth it dont you  i just deliver the cars shes all yours  frick  but really the only difference is that by the third year nothing catches you by surprise  mrs farr is still having acute abdominal pain  so whats wrong with me doctor  oh good lord i have no idea okay dont panic just do  what all doctors do in this situation and fake a page  uhoh got a code 3 down the hall  whats that  uhhh code 3 not as bad as a code 4 but a hell of a lot worse  than a code 2 ahh i cannot figure out whats wrong with mrs farr i gotta go ask cox  why wont you ask me  youre a surgeon  you just cut people up you dont actually know anything  oh yeah  dr cox  dr cox  big cheese  yes  if youre wondering why dr kelsos nose is squeaking  about a week ago he was torturing elliot  and dr cox well  needless to say there were consequences  perry great news i managed to swing it so  that you get to go over to the state pen today and do the annual inmates physicals  well hells bells bobbo if you want to fire me  just do it  i would but even though this room was quite crowded when  you suckerpunched me apparently nobody saw it happen  uh so what happened sir  so dr cox can you uh look at her chart  newbie did you not see what just happened kelso is so  far up my ass that i can taste brylcreem in the back of my throat  and you youre youre thirdyear now  wake up this whole dr cox riding in to the rescue part of the show  is _over_  oh youre on your own  elliots unlucky streak continued with the head of the radiology department  dr moyer uh you told me my patient had colitis and it turns out  it was just travelers diarrhea  so sounds like good news  yeah he took it as bad news maybe cause of the unnecessary  colonoscope i shoved three feet up his pooper  what do you want me to do  uh apologize to my patient and tell him it was your mistake no big deal  think im gonna pass on that one see i got you pegged as one of those  spineless types thats not gonna cause me any trouble no matter what i do  so thanks for stopping by  and dont forget your car door  i just didnt want it to get stolen okay  that was me not caring  what  now that we can always hear dr kelso coming  some people have modified their work habits  so youre engaged to that surgeon guy  mmhmm  is it serious  no ted we swing  squeakys acomin  oh hey bobcat listen i was hoping  that maybe you could get someone to cover for me out at the prison tonight  i know that the very idea of you doing a favor for me makes those ass cheeks  clench up so tight that you could shovea lump of coal up there  and probably crap out a diamond right  ohh come on bob i cant even remember the last time  i saw my son and you  you  youre a father for gods sake  you understand dont you  my son was recently kicked out of his hari krishna sect  for being too much of a hippie and is currently residing in the portland
