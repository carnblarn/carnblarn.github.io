were on the same pee schedule  no were not  this is not good  why assume mr barnes stole it theres lots of people on that ward  good point  three of them are in comas two cant walk ones a nun  also a valid point  elliot im sure mr barnes didnt take the drugs  he has been in rehab for over six months  theres no reason to be so judgmental  i am not judgmental if i were id tell you your shoes are ugly  do not stoop to her level  your bangs make you look like a chipmunk  its a frame why can nobody see that  can we get back to the matter at hand  fine so who do you thinks right  yeah  crap  for the love of oprah why would you come to paediatrics  i cant go unless youre around youre my little pee buddy  what do you say we cut to the chase  youre dating carla the one person in this hospital i can remotely stand  and she wants us to get all kissyfaced with each other i get it i do  but every single time i shake my magic eight ball  and ask it are we gonna be best friends   do you know what it says  no  outlook is buhleak  dr cox you really cant trust those things  when i was 9 i asked mine if i should open it and drink the fluid inside  i puked blue for three days  just a real cute story heres what youre gonna do  go back to carla dont obsess about why shes with you  just tell her we went to a ballgame and we borrowed each others sweaters   nkay little buddy  what a  i dont think we should stand for it  dr kelso cant just decide were not allowed to switch shifts any more  i was supposed to see my nephew tonight in pippin   whos he playing  pippin  bob kelso is a bad man  i dont know we never think about how hard it is to always be the bad guy  i want him to die   hello sweetness  ladies  carla i was thinking about what you said about your mothers birthday  i dont want her spending it alone so ive arranged for you to swap shifts   dr kelso  dont mention it  should i pick you up tomorrow at the same place  great goodbye all you smiling faces   whod you side with elliot or alex  neither i pretended i was paged  when they said they didnt hear it i called them liars and ran   they both have a point  stick to the booty principle   whats that  who do you want to sleep with   alex  then she might be right  im not sure about turks advice sometimes he oversimplifies things  especially when it comes to booty  what would you say if i told you i feel ready right now  i agree with alex ive been thinking about it a lot  i think shes right about mr barnes we cant just jump to conclusions  i am so surprised  tell me something   what do you think about alex  no way  im saying nothing about a girl youre sleeping with  hes not sleeping with her  no ramifications nothing tell me what you  i dont like or trust her im afraid shes gonna hurt you   youre jealous  shut up  shut up because youre so jealous of her  that you dont even care that im happy  do you honestly believe thats whats going on here  do not under any circumstances say what youre thinking  im sorry but you had your chance with me  why dont i ever listen to me  dont worry about yesterday  elliots not the type that holds a grudge  then again  you should tell your neighbour you will hang your hammock wherever you please  and if she doesnt like it she can move  thats what i like about you carla  you dont give a rats ass what anybody thinks   morning dr kelso  nurses  get up  i want to apologise for not showing up last night  i got home and totally passed out  i wasnt even sure we had a definite plan so  im sorry i couldnt make it  she seemed sorry i am too  someone called for a surgical consult  youre dr turk  of course you are note to self  youve got to start writing down the names of people that annoy you  yeah whats up  twovessel disease he hasnt been on medical management  when an attending calls a lowly intern for a consult  its an unwritten law the intern should agree with whatever he says  dont you agree  actually sir i recommend bypass surgery  thats my pager  youre wrong  hes so wrong  you make me so angry i  i have to pee  me too  look at her shes not even gonna say hi to me  fine i wont say hi to her ever  i cant believe how stubborn she is  i am the wrong man to play chicken with  shell blink any second now  she is so stubborn  laverne could you hand me some gauze  maybe dr kelso can pick you up and take you to the gauze store   all right now listen  carla  this paperwork has your signature on it and it is totally subpar  i wont stand for this kind of shoddy work  let me help you  you went and got an intern to agree with you so the guy doesnt get surgery   you caught me  a bypass is the right call  considering the risks  hes a diabetic with twovessel disease  antianginals could be equally effective   either treatment could work  sure  so what are we arguing about   hey baby  hi sweetie  it was just then they realised what was really going on  dr cox was in love with turks girlfriend   either of you want a sandwich  im all set  so every tox screening came back negative on mr barnes   he didnt take anything  so  so you were wrong  its not about that any more is it  when you cant make things right with one of your best friends  nothing can make you feel better  im finally off do you wanna get outta here  hello  so are we doing this or what  dr kelso   yes what is it  i wanted to thank you  for what you did  when you yelled at me in front of the other nurses   i appreciate it  young lady  i yelled at you because that paperwork  looked like it had been done by a drunk fouryearold  listen carla i have a family who loves me  a handful of close friends and a wonderful hobby shop in my basement  i dont spend much time worrying about peoples feelings around here  i just do whatever makes me happy  so can i still get a ride tomorrow  i dont know if ive forgiven you yet for hiding  but you could always skip the bus tomorrow morning  and take your chances  were both men one of us more than the other   but thats ok  what do you want  im not gonna do anything to mess up you and carla  i wont tell her how you feel its not my place  but the minute you screw this thing up  and you will screw it up ill be waiting  if youre gonna wait id bring a book  cos its gonna be a while   you going in  im right behind you  remember when the new star wars movie came out and it was built up  but it really wasnt that great in bed  relax the first ones a freebie  so you can get your form back  im gonna change  i already brushed eight times but im gonna take some mints out of your purse  see all i did was lose the pants  but i think it gives me a completely different look   these are percocet  jd  you never came over last night cos you passed out  yep i should go  the speech sounds the same no matter whose mouth it comes out of  even someone you thought you could really like  you dont understand ok  my job comes with a lot of stress  its not like i have a serious problem  we ended up talking for a while after that  i gave her some names of people that could help her  but she never got back to me  after that things got back to normal   you owe me 20 bucks  no but i never even made   all right i shouldve done this a long time ago so here goes  im sorry i shouldnt have accused you of being jealous  you were just looking out for me you were right about alex  you never did sleep with her did you  nah but why does that matter  because i was jealous  are you sure  what are you thinking about  this
