what  you have suggested that youre feeling rather tired lately   havent you  im listening   and that you bruise easily  like an old banana  i think youre fine but if youd like  we can go ahead and

elliot  hey i found an apartment  great you know but theres no rush for you to move out  are we gonna just live with each other forever  and anytime we feel lonely or vulnerable we have hot sex   that would be stupid  were both human  so staying in that situation would be a big mistake  i know  sometimes when youre down you end up taking it out on the wrong person   going on vacation  cos im a janitor  so when i pack for vacation i just pack cleaning supplies   thats funny  i thought so  actually im going to speak at my sons career day  about being a janitor  you think there arent kids out there  that wanna grow up to make the world sparkle   i didnt mean it that way  how did you mean it  look  what the hell are you doing  dr kelso will you just hear me out  all im saying is that miss

look at mr cormans chart  whats he got scurvy theres no chance you were on a ship   in the 1700s is there  just look at the damn chart  what is it  youre sick   really  really  if i could get out of this place and get away from elliot  for a while i could regroup you know  but sometimes thats not so easy   my truck was right there  where is it now  youd have to ask the guys who stole it  everything i owned was in that truck  jd i dont know what im gonna do  gotta go good luck  tallyho  she was going like 35 miles an hour  all you saw was like knuckles and a bun poor bessie  what kind of grown man still names his car   you do  ive had malik since i was 17  thats totally different dont worry about kelso   his wife can drive him  his wife hates him  morning skipper  im so dead  mr corman  im afraid you have waldenstroms macroglobulinemia  it is a very rare form of cancer  yeah i think i had that in college once  this is dr zeltzer  he is the finest oncologist we have on staff  really you think so   yeah i do  thank you   so where do we start  well first off we need to  better than leventhal  leventhals a quack youre the guy youre the man   you can do it  bless you  that was some catch the patient shows almost no symptoms  you called for a bone marrow biopsy  what made you even think to do that  how about he was unbelievably annoying  and i wanted to scare him so bad  that hed never come back in my hospital again  dont worry dr zeltzer hes only kidding  stupid see thats where leventhal has the edge  he wouldve got that the mans hilarious  of course he wouldnt be laughing so hard  if he knew i was sleeping with his wife  i dont know i didnt know it was just your patient   what  nothing   then whats with the look  i have a crick in my neck  since i no longer have any furniture for my new place  i had to sleep in my tub last night  oh how was your date  the italian people are really good at making sauce   fantastic  youre such an ass  could you speak up mr roberts doesnt hear so well  if youre looking for your beeswax its not over here  now she all mad  i needed your help last night and you bailed on me  youre the one that drew all these lines up  said that were not in a relationship  jd i wasnt looking for a boyfriend last night  i was looking for a friend  i guess she told him gotta go  i was thinking about what you said and youre right  kids dont wanna hear about being a janitor   i never said that  its ok  cos instead im gonna be a doctor  i borrowed some stuff from your locker our locker  and listen if i dont get it back to you  within like two days consider it gone  i am so sorry miss kaye told me about picking up her grandkids  and she said she was feeling fine and i believed her  doctor follow me son have you used drugs in the last 48 hours  oh no sir never use drugs  because this shot youre about to get could kill you   if mixed with narcotics  oh drugs yes sir all the time  see waiting for the tox screen six hours  frightening the bejeebies out of the riffraff ten seconds  everybody lies dr turk  whether its that doobie brother in there  or say me when i tell my son he can still live at the house  after he graduates from art school and by the way sport  mrs kaye doesnt have any grandchildren  im still a virgin   youre pregnant  again  since the bypass doc nothing but salads  look it was an accident  my flashlight didnt have any batteries  so you decided to put your penis in there  mr corman great news  dr zeltzer and i have gone over your test results  and your prognosis is excellent   thats great  yeah it is  but you know what pat yourself on the back all you want  but im not an idiot  i know that you were screwing with me  that i come in here thinking im sick when im not  but if you remember anything remember this  if i didnt have cancer i could have been just some guy  looking for help that you treated like crap  yeah  the whole thing is giving me an ulcer  you wanna be tested for that too dont you  do you mind  hey elliot look you were right  i should have been there for you last night  thanks  and im sorry you lost all your things that totally sucks  how are you holding up  you know what it was just stuff im fine  this is good it feels like weve really turned a corner  throw her down on that gurney and mount her like a lion  i know   why didnt you stop me  what  why did you let me harass that guy  you think the fact that you got annoyed  and became insensitive with another human being is my fault  yeah look whenever im about to do some stupidass stuff  youre the one who calls me on it and damn sure makes me stop  thats the way it works thats the way its worked for years  just exactly what happened to that  i guess i just dont get as good a read on you as i used to  maybe all that therapy has changed you  please im crazier than ever  during this entire conversation ive actually been imagining myself  sitting on a throne between us watching all of this  maybe were just not as close as we used to be  maybe  so youre just like right here watching us  no other side yeah  im invisible to the naked eye  of course  why so sad chocolate bear  i just dont feel like going back to that hospital you know  yeah hey is my breath ok  i think lisa and i might try talking tonight  that whole damn building is packed with liars  it is not  well if the cut was that deep  id probably just pull your arm off  once again  dr jan ltor dr jan ltor  ok maybe youre right but were doctors  that comes with the territory  some patients dont like telling the whole truth  well i dont get why people have to do that  i dont know maybe its because theyre proud  maybe its cos theyre scared  you know what it was just stuff im fine  maybe its because telling the truth  would make em feel too vulnerable  i guess dude youre gonna be late for giftshop girl  oh my god  there are a few things ive always believed in  flowers are good for any occasion  nothing is more important than making time for an old friend  especially if the old girls seen better days  cos even if it breaks your heart to be just friends  if you really care about someone youll take the hit  and it wasnt just stuff  it was all of my yearbooks and this little pink blanket  that my grandma had crocheted for me and  oh and my first love letter my first rag doll  and i only had one picture of  and my shoes
