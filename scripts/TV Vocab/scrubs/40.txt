anyway the way you two just looked at each other  i couldve sworn i was looking at them  lame this guy  morning dr kelso  how is it this hospital gets up in arms if our mri machine misses a tumour  but every morning our coffee machine spits out warm urine   and nobody gives two hoots  we missed a tumour  who cares point is i have to go across the street to get coffee  piping hot coffee that puts a hop in your step and your ass in the john  i just wish i really knew why it hurt so much right here  mr simms it could be because its damp out  it could also be because four days ago i sliced your chest open with a knife  you had surgery buddy youll be fine  dr dorian i have a couple of minutes off  would you like me to show you that technique i told you about  see now what you wanna do is choke up on the club like this  and then hit this bad boy like a baseball  you cant teach that  no you cannot my friend no you cannot  so what was up with mr simms back there  during his openlung biopsy  i accidentally nicked his intercostal artery now hes got a haematoma   are you gonna tell him  what and risk a lawsuit  besides itll heal just fine anyway  hey throw me another ball   do you

the dealio  no dealio ted  we just stopped by to say hi hi  see you later buddy   later  hmm   we knew what we had to do  lets come clean  lets not tell anyone ever ever ever ever ever   ever  ever  i guess its hard to predict how a person will react  so you wanna come in  nah its ok ill see you tomorrow  well jordan why dont we just think of today as a test run  other times people react exactly how you think they will  the only way i couldve felt more taken care of  is if i were at a fourstar resort or a spa or a third world country  where you boil your own sewage if you want something to drink  oh and by the way giant giant feather in your cap  for how much power you wield here after 15 years  come on come on jordan  i am so sorry everything fell apart today honest to god i am  i guarantee when you get here tomorrow  dr gerson will in fact be in the superdeluxe birthing suite  so that you can go ahead and have that storybook drugaddled  pitocininduced pregnancy youve dreamed

have other problems  i know some windshield hush money wont keep the karma gods  from coming after turk and me  qtip dr murphy called  they need you to cover his call tonight  dude dr wens doing a stomach stapling  and he wants you to be there to hold back the guys fat flap  apparently my face is scaring my patients  so youre gonna take them off my hands for about a week  turk the dairy queen burned down   no  now do you see  i cant take it i cannot hide the crazy a minute longer  the worst part is paul is this perfect guy who wants to take things slow  im this mountain of cuckoo about to erupt  and spew molten crazy over him and hes gonna die like this  calm down do what i used to do  find people who dont even know paul and just let it out in little bursts  good afternoon ladies  when i was a kid i got a sunburn like that  i just peeled all the skin off put it in a pile and ate it  good lord  for us it was time to face the karmic music   we hit your car with that golf ball  well technically it was dr turk  you liar ok it was you  you know what it really doesnt matter  why were you guys hitting golf balls way downtown   downtown  i told you it wasnt us  this is almost exactly like the kind of picnics  i had with my mother  youre so cute  and now its exactly like em you got something in your tooth  i cant believe i have something on my teeth  get it off get it off   did i get it  no but dont worry about it  so anyway i was thinking elliot  elliot is everything all right  everythings great yeah  come here  what  its just well this is what bothered me the other night  i know theres something wrong but you wont talk about it  i guess sometimes it feels like youre holding back  of course im holding back im insane you idiot  remember when you told me i had pit stains  ive cried every 15 minutes on the halfhour since you told me  i am racked with selfdoubt im claustrophobic  germophobic phobiaphobic i talk to myself i talk to my cat  i talk to three separate shrinks about the fact  that my cats respond to me in my mothers voice  and yesterday when that stupid pretty surgical nurse  handed you latex gloves i almost killed a guy i was stitching up  because i couldnt stop thinking about you having sex on a box of steaks  why a box of steaks my dad had an affair with a female butcher  and as i mentioned before i am insane there i opened up are you happy  no  im incredibly turned on  ive gotta uh get this right outta my teeth  excuse me     ow im ok  i still believe in karma and if i wasnt being punished for mr golf ball  i think i knew where my bad karma was coming from  i dont know that many straight guys that wear cologne   im down to one spritz  hmm  look dr cox asked me to check in on you  im sorry i havent been here until now   he asked you to check on me  yep   so howre you doing  well ive ruined everything  all he tried to do was take care of me and show me he loved me  but no i had to drive him away because i dont like being vulnerable  even when im normal let alone with my ankles in stirrups  and my cootchie on display  so now hes gone away for good  and i would like to get this stupid thing out of me  so i can go home and kill myself  well you sound good  i was going to tell him the truth eventually  i just wanted to see if he was going to be with me  because he wanted to not because he had to   do you know what i mean  what are you talking about  its his baby stupid dont tell anyone  all right kappa gamma says its time to get this thing underway  so i dont care if you want me here or not im staying   whatever all right  good  what were you talking about  apartheid   its wrong  oh  call me new agey but i think karmas a powerful force  i honestly dont know what put  the idea of golfing on the roof in my head  dude it is so nice out here  do you mind if i take it down to the banana hammock  because i honestly believe  if youve got some bad karma coming your way well  hi dr kelso  you cant hide from it  karmas really just doing the right thing  so anyway mr simms  i wanted to explain to you why your chest was hurting  during surgery i  or about being who you really are  either way its a lot to think about  oh my god would you look at the mug on jordans baby  must have one buttugly father  yeah  damn you karma
