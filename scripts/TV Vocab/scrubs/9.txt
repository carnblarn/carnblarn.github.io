                as a firstyear intern you have little free time  when you have a night off its important you do something constructive   hows it goin  i have no idea who you are  whats up dude  wait a second hes dating carla  this is not good  first i already told her i got a girlfriend  second you just put your bare lips on my ear   hows it going im  jd i know  he wont stop talking about you im jennifer  do you really spend every day saving childrens lives  tell the nice lady  i do what i can  its on its on   its on  oh yeah  i know two things about bars  one theyre packed thanksgiving week  two put a beer in my hand and im mr smooth  i was laughing so hard milk was coming out of my nose  i once tripped over an iv and blood shot over everyone  a little got on my nose  every damn day saving those children  who wants margaritas dude less blood more fruity drinks  right  turk hasnt changed a bit since college  hes the same goof ball who tells me how to be cooler  dude   this girls hot so dont blow it  why do you say that  because youre like a 24hour convenience store you never close  that sounds like a fat albert joke  dont worry about it i feel good tonight know what im saying  good  except for this stabbing pain in my side  up all night with a high fever cramping and crying   dude  my bad  not crying punching the wall all manly and angry like you know what i mean  see ya later buddy  poor bambi dont worry carla will take care of you   make sure hes admitted right away  all right  on the bright side itll be interesting to see what its like to be a patient  you know people die here  youre a good friend  i do what i can can i have your stuff  so did you talk to any girls last night  im an attractive man we both know this  its a burden youre gonna have to live with  one of many  jd talked some girl up  really are you gonna call her  not right away  showtime clear out so i can check him out  youre examining me i dont want you to see my unmentionables  ive seen underwear before  i use the word unmentionables for my genitals as well  with respiratory distress  save your breath  hello dad  never thought youd call me that again after i left   dr cox  relax carla  the man im smothering isnt my father  dr benson used to be chief of medicine here  hi how are you  still have that great rapport with the nurses  carla totally gets me thats why ive systematically tried to drive her away  ever see that therapist i recommended  not yet no  shortness of breath dizziness problems urinating  no no is it a problem if it whistles  youre making this so much easier are you sexually active  its active  ill write rare dry spell in the margin  ok time for the physical  cold hands  suck it up  elliots exam was reminiscent of when my older brother beat the crap out of me  god  see it wasnt so bad all done  im puking every hour and my fevers high  but youre sure its ok for me to be out of bed  i dont know dr benson was my mentor dont do that annoying thing   what annoying thing  when you talk  come on   does that not drive you crazy  you get used to it  i know youre excited with the gown on but at no time are you to curtsy  he can say what he wants but hes showing me off  dr benson  just give us a second will ya big guy did you hear about her  watching dr cox i realised we never really stop  craving the attention of people we look up to  any questions  good   he seemed nice  careful newbie  im hearing it now it is kind of annoying when i talk  in a lot of relationships you regress to the person you were when you met  so elliots exam was that bad   dude she violated me  in a good way  whats the deal  i think i broke my ass  youre telling everyone i violated you  not everyone just the people that work here and my parents  was there something wrong with my exam  so there it is the classic trap two choices  either wuss out or tell the truth  youre kinda rough  youre rough and youre a little businesslike   youre cold  you mean my hands  yeah those too i just think you could be more comforting  i could tell she appreciated how hard it was for me to say that  do you know how annoying you are when you talk  maybe not   i was watching that  its broken  dr cox did you get my memo reminding senior staff  that lab coats must be worn at all times  you know i did get it bob and at first i just threw it away  but then i decided that wasnt a grand enough gesture  so i made a replica of you out of straw  and then i put my lab coat on it with your memo in the pocket  then invited the neighbourhood kids  to light it on fire and whack it with sticks  so i have been looking at dr bensons chart  his chest xray was normal  his vitals are stable so lets discharge him  now hold the phone there skipper  dr benson should be able to stay here until he feels hes ready to go  give me a break he was only chief of medicine for ten years  well i havent had my coffee yet so im finding it hard coming up with  a more colourful way to say who gives a crap  actually that wasnt half bad  our next patient is a 26yearold male  who has presented vomiting abdominal cramps and fever  i never realised how hard rounds are on the patient  it feels like youre on display  still rodins masterpiece makes us wonder  why didnt he spend a little less time thinking  and a little more time at the gym  i do cardio  which most likely indicates what dr reid  he has a simple case of appendicitis  how would you proceed dr dorian  i would give me that news in private no matter how angry i was at me  sounds like theres a fascinating back story here  turf him to surgery moving on  watch it bambi you dont want a 100lb white girl mad at you  youll flinch every time you hear a range rover  i cant believe i have to spend all thanksgiving here   tell me that wouldnt kill you  not really  do they celebrate thanksgiving in your homeland   you mean chicago  you have a chicago  be nice to me im getting surgery   dr wen is the attending  whos the intern doing the work  i get to cut you open i get to cut you open  go girl  go get it  good god  mr davis you wont be home for thanksgiving  but youll be eating leftovers by saturday  great and doctor thank you so much  youre welcome  weve gotten to know each other over the last week havent we  id say so  you found me comforting  god no  im pretty good with people   youre horrible  im warm  youre very cold i mean your hands   its like youre a yeti  i have bad circulation  i do this all day and it doesnt help  listen sweetie youre a very efficient competent doctor  but your exams do you examine everyone like that  or just people you feel have wronged you in some way   i appreciate your opinion  its not an opinion  you see those guys right there  theyre pretending to be asleep so you wont manhandle them   they are not  dude what are you doing  too frank right  i know its probably why my mom pushed me down the stairs  she is fat though and boring  bps 60 over palp is he having a heart attack  its hypotension and electrical alternance on the monitor  this is tamponade  viral infections can cause pericarditis and a rapid accumulation of fluid  it looks like a heart attack but dont let it fool you  bps stabilizing   what have we got  dont worry were fine here  its a universal feeling to want to be there for a good friend  so from now on im going to stop seeing turk as my crazy frat brother  dr turk if you will  well mark for the incision right about here  after all hes a highly trained competent young doctor  dude  im about to bust a mad slizice in your insides  sir id prefer if someone other than dr turk performed the surgery  fair enough  dr cotter will perform the procedure tomorrow morning  the best thing about friends is how quickly things like this blow over   you understand right  whatever man  you want some salsa for that chip on your shoulder  i cant believe you i would never ever do something like this to you   youre like school in july  what do you mean  no class  youre not supposed to scare me like that sir  it was just a prank admittedly i took it too far  well i still laughed but  i felt a little guilty i wasnt here administering  i just came to check on my favourite patient  i must have the wrong room   how are you dave  im doing great bob  i owe you one  hey doc you should go ahead and get some rest  ill be out of your hair soon  just a sec skipper youll stay here until you decide youre ready to leave  for gods sake you were the chief of medicine here for over ten years  am i right  that was what i said this morning  yeah it sounded familiar   what  i was wondering  how you comb your hair so the horns dont show  i wonder what bothers you the most  is it that i saved his life and he likes me as a person  i bet its how much he respects me as a doctor  how does that taste bitter hard to get down   here you go  great  carla everyone likes you so much it makes me wonder   why patients think youre a cold fish  my god you noticed   honey they told me  great if anyone needs me  ill be in the supply closet eating sugar packets  look elliot  im not the kind of person who likes telling people what to do but  heres what to do heres what i think heres what your problem is  dont think of your patients as strangers  im dating turk i get it sometimes he is a big kid  but when it comes to work hes as capable and mature as anyone  take those out  baby i was being a walrus  jds not only your friend but a patient too and hes scared  kelso is pushing your buttons every now and then let something go  turks not that mature he spent all yesterday being a walrus  he had straws and stuff  the only thing jds scared of is sharks  and he has a weird thing with pennies hes not scared about this  kelsos not just some harmless guy pushing my buttons carla  hes a pod person   youre wrong  youre so wrong  wrong wrong wrong wrong  youre wrong  i think youre right i dont know how to connect with patients  start by touching them holding their hand or stroking their hair  or give them a reassuring pat on the arm   what are you doing  nothing youll be great  darn right  there you go sir  im sorry its my watch ill get it  im so sorry let me  dave at sacred heart we dont treat symptoms we treat people   theres something on your back  what does this one say  never stop kicking me  and on the other side is my discharge form  bob you tried to discharge me an hour before i almost died  well  how very clever  what it wasnt me in fact  i think you put it there yourself to get more attention  it was me i put it there  hey buddy ok forget about everything thats going on  we know that youre bummed out about missing thanksgiving so  we decided to bring it to you  wow guys thanks wheres the food  who wants the unmentionables  bambi your fevers spiking  theyre worried your appendix might burst so were going into surgery now  whos on call  dr turk lets get started  most doctors dont believe in the outofbody experience thing  and i dont know if it was real or a dream  but i swear i was up there watching turk operate on me  and i have to say hes an amazing surgeon  dude could you not look over my shoulder while im doing this  its a little unnerving  youve got a little fever probably atelectasis from lying in bed   im really uncomfortable  im so sorry   youre not gonna hug me are you  im done with all that  if it makes you feel better i hate this touchyfeely culture  thank you  that whole kiss hello thing  i dont want anyone touching me unless we have sex  even then i dont want them to overdo it   where in connecticut are you from  greenwich you  darien im really burning up here  god thats fantastic its like an ice pack  yeah  im sorry to hear about your mom are you at least close with your dad  you see this right here thats his work  pretty good for a man in a wheelchair  doc im sorry you gotta be here on thanksgiving night  my wife cant cook anyway shes 22 what are you doing  forget about me whats your wife look like any pictures  not of this one  you know being back at this old place  you know the thing i have found to be the most disappointing  i think i can guess  you  probably because you do things like show up the chief of medicine  when anybody whos been in a room with bob kelso for two minutes  knows how big an ass he is   go easy i just thought  you dont think perry  youre such a talented doctor  if you played the game youd be in a position to change things around here  but youre too stubborn for that arent you  all right kid  gin your deal  hi i just need to check on your incision   turk i was an idiot  its ok man  no seriously man i want you to know if i ever need surgery again  i want you inside of me  i want to be the one inside of you  look jd i get it  to me youll always be that geeky kid with the pat benatar tshirt  dude she rocks  i want you to know how serious i am about what i do  did you stitch your initials into me  thats not important its still thanksgiving for 20 more minutes  now you can have ginger ale  and a cracker  i forgot your change two pennies  get those pennies away from me  happy thanksgiving man  i guess what they say is true  the people you work with really do become your family  like your brother  and your sisterinlaw  or that cousin you have funny feelings for  and the crazy angry uncle everyone sort of hopes isnt coming this year  dr cox  if you want you can come down here and hang out  nobody talk  just drink  uncomfortable silences and alcohol  just like thanksgiving at home  drink   there was the nina  shut up
