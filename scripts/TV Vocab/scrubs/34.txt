 hi dr kelso i was just i was on call  well i have the call sheet right here  and your name doesnt seem to be on it  but what do i know  im just a kindly old man who doesnt know the difference  between a doctor on call  and one who maybe just needs a warm bed for the night  ive just been so swamped with work  i couldnt even make time to find a new place  i understand life is hard and all that  but if you want a bed in my hospital  you better have a damn rent check or a massive coronary  in the next five seconds  and believe me missy either ones fine with me   thank you sir  no problem  i had a really good time tonight  i was nervous when you spent five minutes talking through a napkin  that wasnt me that was nappy the icebreaking puppet  that little guy earned his money tonight   so you think youre in huh  come on i am so in   you cant be sure  i feel pretty good about it   you want me  i dont  yeah im a doctor all the symptoms are there  you do  just kiss me  whoa you know i thought i had to sneeze  but it was a false alarm   lets do this  ok  you know what it is its like a tickling  i got this like weird its a flutter  nappy stop fooling around and  give me a kiss  i guess you never know how the monsters gonna attack  sometimes it makes you so tired of taking care of people at work  you cant bear the thought of taking care of someone at home  all right we need to talk about this  sometimes it pulls you away at the absolute worst time  babe im sorry  sometimes it even takes the roof over your head  and sometimes the monster takes something  you never thought you could lose  like your mojo  is that a roll of quarters or are you just having a good time  actually its a roll of quarters its laundry day  see ya  so little jd isnt rising to the occasion  its not a big deal nobody knows about this but me   newbie whats up  everythings up  rise and shine sport  what did someone send out a flyer  hey jd hows your penis  calm down he says that to everyone  hey goldman hows your penis  youre freaking out just keep your head down and move  i get it i havent paid you back   so you wont even look at me  no  its been one day you greedy little bastard  see what you did  dr reid your truck is doubleparked  luckily i had a friend i could talk to about anything  turk do you ever have any trouble getting your manhood going   hells no  yeah me neither dog  apparently im the only one here with women problems  listen perry shockingly im not looking to make the permanent move  to your bachelor cave over at swingers towers  you made a kind gesture and i made the mistake  of thinking you could follow through with it do you get it  you dont get it do you  weve been together for a year and a half  the romance cant be gone yet does this make any sense to you  cos it doesnt to me one minute were clicking  and the next youre running for your life whats going on  i know we seem insensitive but in the crunch  most guys are smart enough to say the right thing  baby you have got to chill  im sorry crazy person says what   what  thatta girl  sometimes the worst thing a guy can say is nothing at all  you know what forget it  dr reid  i have no reading material for my daily postlunch  well lets just call it reading session  i need your research proposal  or a vanity fair if you have one  if i could just get a little more time on that  im sorry sweetheart im fresh out of special treatment today  i used it all trying not to stare at that albino doctor down in radiology  dont let him get to you just keep saying positive things to yourself  its too much im just one person  thatta girl  sometimes i get so jealous of turk  were residents now and were so swamped  and he just never seems to show it  i guess you pick up the slack when he doesnt have the energy  yeah you would think so   arent you gonna get that  nah its just todd  hes called four times to ask if i want to move into his pants  you never expect a clich to be an actual conversation starter   women huh  tell me about it  its like theyre from another planet  ok im going to engage you two in a conversation  you will speak of it to no one   agreed  ok  it has gotten to the point where im going back in my head  over all my old relationships  im not going to sit here  and count up all the women ive ever slept with   twelve  nine  eighteen but none of them really understood me  i consider myself a romantic guy whos stressed out  i thought the person whod understand would be carla  the weird thing is that im trying this time  i just wonder if im what she really wants  i wonder if ill ever be able to make it work out with anyone  my peeps on the fritz  dude   poor newbie  no  im talking about you guys you guys are like my peeps  youre my dogs and youre on the fritz  so thats where i get peeps fritz came from  god love you newbie  thank you for giving me some perspective  theres your stupid dollar  and by the way your new nickname is pee pee la fritz  enjoy   hey  is this where youre sleeping tonight  yeah so its cosy hospital adjacent  elliot come on this is crazy  youre living out of a van like a hobo or   jewel  her poetry changed my life  i know you wanna show you can stand on your own two feet  but you dont have to prove anything to me  come on come stay with me and turk  whatd you page me to the roof for  well i was thinking that you work so hard  and that if i want surprise and romance  that maybe its my turn to be the one who brings it  so i brought us a couple of salads   thats great  a box of 36 hot wings  now thats what im talking bout  and some bluecheese dressing  i love this woman  i guess in the end  the monsters always gonna be there  the trick is to not let it beat you  curly fries  and sometimes that means letting a friend help you out   thanks again jd  dont sweat it   well have a good night  you too  as for me i just have to hope that my problem  will eventually work itself out  merry christmas  this is exactly what i wanted
