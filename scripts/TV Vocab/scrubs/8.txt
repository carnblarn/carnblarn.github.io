                one of the best things about friendship with turk  is challenging each other to try new things  i cant believe were going to a strip club  i dont think about it that way its a place to buy a burger  thats a twoandahalf mile walk away from the hospital  no skin we all win  lets get outta here before we end up on the news  are you gentlemen visiting the club  no were protesting  im worried about the kids  so whats that in your pocket  this is its 38 in singles  i bought a newspaper and this is the change from my 40  neil  sir   no pulse  starting cpr  call an ambulance  coming to you live as two young doctors are trying to resuscitate my cameraman  well maybe im biased but to me  every doctor here at sacred heart is a hero  does that mean im a hero i dont know  theres my dynamic duo  dr dorian dr turk  holy inferiority complex batman  how low is my selfesteem that im the sidekick in my own fantasy  it could be worse robin you could be alfred the butler  damn you sir  life in a hospital moves fast one second youre a hero  the next youre obsessing about evaluations   who cares its only a grade  really what did you get  aplus i turned on the waterworks and the resident changed it to aplusplus   a proud day for women everywhere  why are you worried  with the hero thing whoever evaluates you will give you a gold star  listen supergirl im gonna break you into so many pieces  that my grandmother who can do a 1000piece puzzle in an hour  will never be able to put you back together  even if she goes go back in time to when her vision was perfect  somehow i doubt it  before you deny you like looking at strange naked women again  i should remind you that when you stay at my place its not a hotel  the movie titles do come up on the bill  im sticking with

black doctor in an inner city hospital  i wanna hear this is it possible to turn up the volume  thats as high as it goes  listen let me tell you what happened  damn  when i saw that it was missing did you not think id come to you  i dont know what youre talking about  so youre gonna play it that way huh  touch   i finished my evaluation  great  i thought it would take longer so the marching band

now you can have this thing back any time you want  youre gonna have to bark like a dog though  im not gonna bark like  its your call  woof  good boy  at the very least im gonna end today on a good note  i got something to show you  is this an uncomfortable moment thatll change our friendship  no no youre going to like it  good cos i need some good news man  can you believe that news lady whats it like to be a black doctor  i just wish this was over  why have we stopped  roll em up  why do you think i wanna be a part of this  kelso said it would make us role models i just assumed  everybody assumes that im a good athlete  or that i grew up poor or that i love sanford and son  but you do love sanford and son  we both do  thats what im talking about  if dr kelso wants me to be a role model for the community  because im a great doctor great i will sign on the dotted line  but thats not what this is about  all my life ive been singled out because im black   i didnt enter the contest  smile for the picture   remember our college brochure  they put you on the cover  twice  its different this time now its both of us  you can still see my hand on your shoulder  thats when i realised im not gonna let people take advantage of me  this is unfair youre supposed to do my evaluation  and you know what youre gonna do it buddy boy  buddy boy  why i oughta   im serious  relax newbie  its just an evaluation it should be easy  if its that easy it wont take you long to do it  all right dont worry about it newbie ill evaluate the hell right out of you   when  the second i get off work   fine  fine  great here it is   you get off like sixish or  danger  youre gonna have to see her eventually  no i know the layout to the airduct system like the back of my hand  of course im gonna have to see her again  so this is the part where its my fault  turk if you could have seen the look on her face  if i think about it again its gonna make me cry  what am i gonna do  keep doing what youre doing eventually shell quit and move   why am i talking to you  what  youre such a guy  you cant understand something this deep on any real emotional level  im sorry about the poster it was racially insensitive  i shouldve been aware of your feelings  theres never been an issue of race between us  youve been nothing but a friend to me   i love you man  hit me one  keep it real  weve got some things to work out but well get there  well get there  sure it hurt but you know what im not gonna wallow in self pity  right after work im gonna go downtown and just tear it up  maybe ill have a cigarette just get a little crazy  and head wherever the night takes me  whats that now  thanks so much  taxi  hey baby how much  hey dont go away man  get me the hell outta here hurry  heres what were gonna do  im gonna leave the cart in the closet and leave the closet unlocked  lf by magic it should happen to reappear i wont ask any questions  i dont even know what it is  then why take it  well if it isnt dr turk the friendly face of sacred heart  yeah  dr kelso about these posters theyre making me uncomfortable  im so sorry i didnt realise you felt that way  well heres what im gonna do im gonna leave them up  i can live with that or i can sue you  dr turk you are an employee here i can advertise however i wish  i can use your image your name  i can manufacture tiny little dr turk action figures  itll cost 1295 when you pull the string it says  i dont like these posters   isnt that right ted  definitely sir  youd certainly be vulnerable from a legal standpoint  how vulnerable  that lawsuit would be over so quickly bring cab fare to the courthouse  since dr turk will be driving your beamer home to his place  hippie  god that felt good  whos the man   is it me  damn right its you  right man  its me  elliot theres no excuse for what i did  no theres not   are we done  im really sorry  dont be if i was going out with my friend i wouldnt invite you  yes i would shed like you better and neither of you would talk to me again  i only did it because i hadnt seen patricia in a long time  you did it cos i dont fit in with you and your friend  its no surprise its not like ive ever fit in anywhere  carla your friend patricias here theres a problem with her son  why so sad marshmallow  stay calm stay calm stay calm  oh good hes not here  dr cox  its time sit down  what do you want me to say that youre great  that youre raising the bar for interns everywhere  im cool with that  im not gonna say that youre ok  you might be better than that some day but now all i see is  a guy worried about what everybody thinks of him  that he has no real belief in himself  i mean did you even wonder why i told you to do your own evaluation  i cant think of a safe answer i just  clam up  i wanted you to think about yourself  and i mean really think  what are you good at what do you suck at i wanted it down on paper  not so i could see it or anybody else but so that you could see it  ultimately you dont have to answer to me or to kelso  you dont even have to answer to your patients for gods sake  you only have to answer to one guy newbie and thats you  there  you are evaluated  get the hell outta my sight  you honest to god get me so angry im afraid i might hurt myself  so what are you one of the male nurses  actually im a surgeon im doing this as a favour for carla  carla is fine whats she doing with you  slummin a little god bless her heart  this is a knife cut huh  yeah its cool  see this right here pinched it in a door two stitches   oh man you hardcore man  hell yeah  darryls gonna be fine but im worried about you  youre upset ill set you up in a room with some fluids and a valium   elliot thank you  there you are  elliot youre coming right   in a sec  are you all right  its funny how our perceptions can be so off  hot cocoa sweetie  thanks  anytime  like when youre searching for a place to fit in  and you dont realise youve been there the whole time  or how posters cant turn you into a role model if youve been one for years  of course in my case i knew exactly where i stood  and it didnt feel that good  i would like to make special mention of one intern here  john dorian  smart kid extremely competent and his enthusiasm  and his determination to always be better  is something i see in him  he cares probably cares too much  but hes definitely somebody you dont want to lose  if you have any questions i could give a crap im goin home  you all get paid too much for doing nothing  oh good newbie you found a specialty  no i just dropped my pen  well look what magically found its way back home  what your window cleaner  no ammonia  this is window cleaner right  why  now thats just bad luck
