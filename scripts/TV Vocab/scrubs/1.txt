and med school  we even got accepted by the same hospital  heres the thing tupac dmx dr dre  in most of their songs they use an extremely volatile racial slur   the n word  i got it  my question is this if were both singing along  and i would never use the word otherwise   am i allowed to say  no  thats good for me to know  finally doctors if there is a mistake dont admit it to the patient  of course if the patient is deceased and youre sure  you can feel free to tell him or her anything  i found us an apartment  ok gang im dr bob kelso and im your chief of medicine  so i just want to encourage you all to think of me as your safety net  because i promise you were a family here  now then go get em doctors  the surgical interns are gonna go grab a beer  the medical interns are having a pacman tournament were all twelve  i love pacman  me too i love watching it i love playing it i love all of it   im elliot  elliot  dont do that  im jd this is turk  are you medical or surgical

eisenhower was a sissy  i think were gonna be ok  from now on whenever im in the room  youre definitely not allowed to talk  dr dorian can you tell me what ailment most often  rounds is like being on a game show  what is uraemia  thats my boy nice clean job on the foley catheter  i had a nurse do it im still afraid to touch anybody  ive been thinking a lot about elliot a whole lot  dr reid youre late  i got puked on  youre off the hook if you can tell me what to look for in a uraemic patient  anyway im going for it   infection  infection  thats my girl  moving on   i knew the answer  im sure you did   im just frazzled  how could you not be  if theres anything i can do for you  you could let me take you to dinner tomorrow night  around seven  or eight  why not  nice  why not thats what she said  why not  daddy why did you marry mommy  tiger i gave her an answer during rounds  and she screwed my brains out  youre the man  what the hell are you doing  did you actually just page me  to find out how much tylenol to give to mrs lenzer  i was worried it could exacerbate  its regularstrength tylenol heres what you do  open her mouth take a handful and throw it at her  whatever sticks thats the correct dosage  under no circumstances are you to compromise our notalking agreement  dr kelso is always saying  im gonna say this as carefully as possible  so i dont overstate it  dr kelso is the most evil human being on the planet  and may in fact be satan himself  its just that this isnt what i expected  most of my patients are  older and sorta checkedout mentally  pumpkin thats modern medicine  advances that keep people alive who shouldve died a long time ago  back when they lost what made them people  your job is to stay sane enough so when someone does come in that you can help  youre not so braindead you cant function  for the love of god what  should we be talking about this in front of  her shes dead  write this down if you push around a stiff  nobodyll ask you to do anything  youve been like a father to me  if they find out nurses are doing your procedures  youll be kicked out so quick your headll spin  and there it is  have a terrific day  im not really dead  bambi heres mrs lenzers tox screen  is turk having the same experience i am   i am such a stud  probably not  i had my hands inside of a guys chest  i couldnt even see them i should not be allowed to do stuff like that  wassup   you werent scared  one way or another  everyone stops bleeding   that is so deep  no it isnt  its a little deep   about the apartment  tman  word up boy how you doing   all right  todd jd   jd this is my man todd  whats goin  i was back in high school  surgical interns are all slice em and dice em  medical interns are trained to think about the body  diagnose test medical interns  you got a stain  were the chess club  i just have bad gas what are you testing me for  to see if your gas could be harmful to others  hes just scared talk to him  look mr burski i heard a systolic murmur in your heart  which is most likely nothing but if i dont check you out   ill worry about you all day  then ill do it for you  youre a good man  im waiting for someone  the door is broke probably the fifth time or so it dont open  maybe a pennys stuck in there   why a penny  i dont know   did you stick a penny in there  no i was making small talk  if i find a penny in there im taking you down  welcome to rounds kids  elliot is the only thing keeping me from losing my mind  she is my dream girl  the necrosis and infected stool most likely indicate what dr dorian  i dont know  sir i have no idea  dr reid can you help him out  superior mesenteric insufficiency  thats my girl patient number two  superior mesenteric  draining stomach fluid will get my spirits up   circles for you  shut up and do it  fantastic now just suck out the fluid with the giant needle  needles too big im gonna get a nurse  come on man learn by doing  why couldnt i do that i hated him at that moment  ok maybe the needle was a little too big   you think  whats going on  nothing this is totally normal  so are you gonna move your stuff in  thats why i came by i think its better if we both branched out  tell him thats stupid tell him you need him  i feel the same way  whats it like being a young hotshot doctor  did you ever go see a movie everyone told you was great  and because of all the expectations you were disappointed  movies nowadays have too many special effects  that was my point  my first code someones heart fails they beep everyone  the first doctor in has to run the room  decides if a patient lives or dies  what am i crazy  you chicken  dont worry turk was there learning by doing   charged  clear  the guy was just sleeping attached to a faulty monitor  i thought we cared for each other  you just wanna sleep with me  i dont wanna sleep with you now  do me right here  see  right pass me a trach kit  thanks  our date is totally cancelled  i was sitting on the floor for two reasons  one i tried to lock elliot in that supply closet and she kicked me hard  and two the oncall room was locked  come on i got ten minutes to sleep  wait  tell me if im going too fast ok  lose the clothes  i heard turk was gonna move in with todd  im surprised that freak isnt in there with him  damn this is hot  nice  your turn  no i gotta get back but very nice  hey bambi  ill call you ok  give me a big ahh  a bigboy ahh  turk almost had sex in the oncall room  you realise of course i have no idea who turk is  but good for him  you see billy it turns out that sex is lifeaffirming  what do you say got a urine sample for me  i just did five minutes ago  but heres the thing  take this put it on the ground close your eyes and go nuts what do you say   cool  attaboy go get em   why are you here  seems like a good kid  youre worried about being on call tonight  yeah  look worstcase scenario  you kill somebody  and its with you the rest of your life  but that is the absolute worstcase scenario  just have the nurses do the stuff youre too chicken to do  which is everything and if you have a really rough admission  call you  no hide in the closet again  this is fun   nurse  im a doctor  the stethoscope the beeper a doctor got it  relax  i hate the darlings the sweethearts  no need to tell me how hard it is being a woman here  youre helping by wearing a thong and hooking up in the oncall room  word gets around  you talk like that do you even know my name  i spend every second of my life either here or taking care of my mom  so yeah maybe i needed a little closeness  you never had a quickie at the club right  or snuck some skinny college boy up to your sorority room  and my thong i think it makes my ass look good  and some days i need to feel good about something  and you judge me well guess what  word does get around ms outforherself  so you can dump on everyone here if you want but you will not hurt me  her names carla by the way  hey champ first night on call starts soon huh  you must be excited  you betcha  about mrs pratt  i heard you wanted to put her on the hospitals transplant list  id recommend keeping her on dialysis a little longer   maybe well get lucky  no problem sir  great have a ball  on call  little poem for ya  bambi lets go  ill check on you every ten minutes mrs marino ok  i need to see you in mr burskis room  are you flirting with me  you are arent you  he crashed the attending thinks it was a pulmonary embolism  no way anyone couldve caught it   you have to pronounce him  why didnt anybody page me  could you just pronounce him so i can go home  ill never forget that moment  the way he looked exactly the same  only completely different  the shame that all i could think about was how hard this was for me  time of death 0200  i just wanted to help people  the hardest part is how quickly you have to move on  dont worry youre gonna be fine  i lied before im scared every second  really  its a good thing they make surgical masks if they didnt  everyone would know my face was like this the whole time  i think its ok to be scared  i need you to tell me that  he needs me  i just came to check up on you see how youre doing  ask him to move in again  turk the offer still stands  i already took the keys out your bag  i love you  and like that i got a second wind  im watching you   how you holding up  there he is my safety net  i saw that youre still pushing to put mrs pratt on the transplant list  bad news though she doesnt have the insurance to cover it  but shes a second away from total renal failure  ok  did you ask the burski family for permission to do an autopsy  theyre still with him  its a teaching hospital you gotta ask  tell him you cant see mr burski again hell understand  sir do you think i could skip just this one  why sure sport  see every story needs a good guy  in fact why dont you just head on home  you look kinda tired  i am pretty tired  dr dorian do you not realise  that youre nothing but a large pair of scrubs to me  the only reason i carry this chart around  is so i can pretend to remember your names  if the patient has insurance you treat them  if they dont you show them the door  and if somebody dies you get the autopsy  get it by rounds tomorrow or ill scratch your name off my chart clear  answer me  crystal clear  great sport  if hes the jerk  then whos the good guy  car accident crashed on the way up  relieve the pressure on his chest jd do it  god no  look at me you can do this   and i believed him  chest tube tray  you know kind of  come on baby lets go  you can do this you have to do this  jd cut him or lose him  give me the tube  i cant get through the pleura  dont be gentle get it in there  connect it please carla   normal rhythm  no way  its a piece of cake its your patient  youre leaving  thats your patient doctor  good   thats enough  sorry  its a very big moment for me  i guess thats it for now 31 hours 12 minutes and i am  you finally off  almost i have one more annoying thing i gotta do  if its the burski autopsy i called the family  and they said fine and to thank you and im sorry  they didnt say that last part i did  the worst part was knowing i could never forgive her  i forgive her  you see i cant survive on my own  im a dork a dork im a dork  even now when i get to go home  ill know the hospitals still here wide awake  get out while you still can  but what the hell  the important thing is i got through my first three days  without looking like a complete idiot  im the man
