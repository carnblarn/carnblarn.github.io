every girl who came to our house in the mid80s   knows how you feel  sweatpants years  i dont like that much freedom down there makes me tingle in my giblets  if you dont start taking this seriously  im a good intern but when youre dealing with disease and family  an intern just doesnt cut it what you need  is a hero  shut up shut up and definitely shut up  but i didnt say any  i know but i enjoy saying it to you ok heres the deal  if were gonna beat this thing and we damn sure are  well do it one way and one way only   were gonna be a team team team  i hear you dr cox  i am so not speaking to you rhonda thank you  im sorry im very excited go  what do you say children are we a team  im in  go team cancer  wow he did it  ive got to go take care of some other patients  i dont believe it i didnt get tomorrows whipple procedure   i know  this is ridiculous  calm down  whats a brother got to do to get a whipple whats a brother got to do  listen youve got to stop turning your medical training  into some egodriven contest no one else is doing that  oh i got the whipple  suck it turk   i will end her  no no   dude let her go  let go of me  itll be so hot  can you tell me the treatment regimen for organophosphate toxicity dr reid  i would give intramuscular epinephrine  then iv calcium gluconate and emergency haemodialysis  if i wanted you to give me three wrong answers in a row  i would have just asked for the usual  dr murphy care to jump in  i think its   do you have a speech impediment  excuse me  you insist on starting every answer with um  so youve either got a speech impediment  or youre a stammering knownothing who doesnt belong in medicine  well spoken  now get out all of you get out  get out out out out  jumpin jupiter i do enjoy the tough love  they probably like it too whether they admit it or not  well  oh the old guys so tough on me but i love him right  right they hate you bob  they hate you from your hooves to the top of your pitchfork  they hate you dear god they hate you good  whatre you laughing at  that hooves and pitchfork part   why  no reason  now do you think you can make ben behave like a patient or not  no problem   i got him to put his gown on  he sure did  and now my butt itches on account of this scratchy chair  whatre we watching  wings and shut up i like the cab driver he slays me  antonio played by the actor tony shalhoub  also particularly fantastic in a film called big night  congratulations your dimaggiolike streak for saying nothing  even remotely interesting is still alive and well  i didnt care about the abuse  the most amazing thing was to watch how dr cox dealt with his friend  how he made him feel safe   do i have to get a special doctor  an oncologist  do we have to talk about this you must have something else on your mind  nope just pretty much that leukaemia thing  ben leukaemia is a petty ugly illness  and well not dignify it by speaking of it  unless absolutely necessary is that clear to you  gotcha  you are such a stud  that was interesting  so doctor wen  you asked bonnie to assist you with this whipple procedure   yes i did  thanks again sir  i guess we should just let it go  i mean neither one of us wants to do anything to make it worse right  you guys ever notice how youre both asian  your mothers maiden name is turner  so you used your key to get into my personnel file big deal  your first kiss was with sarah briggs  at the embarrassing age of 16  she wore a green turtleneck  you wonder sometimes if she still thinks about you im guessing no   how could you possibly know that  im your father  good morning dr dorian  you probably dont notice it yourself but this hospital is a freak show  this is my band  were all working from different departments in the hospital   legal  accounting   shipping and receiving  online property management  including pest control night time security  and nonarboreal gardening services  thats thats just great  we mostly do a cappella versions of cartoon theme songs  dr reid i hope i wasnt too harsh on you   at rounds this morning  oh its ok sir  i dont hate myself much more than usual  well turnabouts fair play and all that so heres an evaluation form  i figured id try to get a read on how all you interns think im doing  dont sign your name  its completely anonymous and dr reid im no shedoc  i can take it   youre going to crush him right  oh yes   how do you spell inadequate  give me that  ill fill it out for you  so mr sullivan your blast percentage  is quite a bit higher than we all expected around 80 percent  thats bad right you want the number to be low huh like in golf  yes exactly like in golf do you play  oh who the hell cares if he plays golf  i was bonding  youre doing a good job too  oh thanks  who is this clown  paul here is the best oncologist in the room  so why dont we all just clam up and listen   we need to start chemo  when  this afternoon  im afraid this afternoon doesnt work for me  ironically i have a golf game to get to  benji dont sweat it come on give me a break  you gonna be there  ive got a thousand patients to look after so no  ill probably miss this first one but i will leave  my lovely and talented assistant kimmy ok  yeah sure you know ok   oh am i kimmy  no im kimmy  oh good  carla torched dr kelso for me  no matter what i wrote i always brought it back to sexual inadequacy   so good  hello ladies   hey doug  hey doug  what did you write on kelsos evaluation   what evaluation  you didnt get yours yet  nobody got one  around here bad behaviour comes back to haunt you  dr wen i want to take this opportunity  to once again apologise to you and the entire asian community  ill pass it on at the next big meeting  you know christopher  surgeons dont have to be shallow rankobsessed clichs  so whos the best surgical intern  is it bonnie is it me come on i just i gotta know  the periampullary carcinoma patient had a failed stenting of the bile duct  i wanna prep him for a pylorus sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy  thanks  wassup tman show the todd some love  ben seemed pretty down after you left  so i could cover and you could hang out  youre a lamb but you dont have to   i dont mind its  newbie stop  its funny how people handle bad news in different ways  some people have a visceral reaction  time to get my soapysoap on  some people go into denial  no way  and others  what chance do you give a guy with bens blast percentage huh  twenty percent thirtymaybe  you see i cant handle that i cannot  so no thank you there johnny  others just walk away  chemotherapy looks harmless  but its poison pumped directly into your veins  every time i got sick when i was a little kid   mom would get me a tonka truck  yeah so  so wheres my tonka truck   score  the earthmover can i see  ah see it with your eyes man not with your hands see  i cant believe perry bailed on you typical  hes always out the door if things get too real  this is the true story  true story  of four people forced to hang out in a hospital  to find out what happens when people stop being polite  and start being real   he didnt bail  if he did hes a total wuss  you said you were giving evaluations to all the interns  well not all at once sweetheart  with your way thered be no accountability no back and forth  you wouldnt have to explain to me why lets see  im most likely frustrated  because i havent gotten any since the bay of pigs  oh sir im so sorry  are we cool  what could have possessed you to write such filth  i need to tell you something  no thats ok carla im gonna take care of that patient  dr kelso i did it because i didnt think that youd know it was me  and i thought that it would be funny  lets take a walk  id like to tell you a few things that i think are funny  oh come on how could this guy be the best  you want to know the difference between you  when youre working i can always see your wheels turning  youre thinking about what to do next what could go wrong  youre not in the moment  and as much as it pains me to say this the todd is  please just because im thorough  and want to keep two kelly clamps on  in case the appendiceal artery is inadvertently incised  so i can gain immediate haemostatic control doesnt mean i think too much  shiny scalpel  dum de de dum de de dum de de dum gonna slice him up   youre afraid of escalators  thats not uncommon  you like feel of cashmere on your skin   how are you doing this  thats right you run away  run away from the truth  look dr cox ive been doing a lot of thinking  and i think the only reason youre not down at that hospital right now  is that youre afraid  i think youre right i do  thats partly because youve really gotten to know me this year  but mostly its because well  i told you that i was afraid earlier  dont tell me youve come here to reiterate things  ive already said because i know the things that ive said  in fact im the one who said them  youve got to get back in the game coxie  coxie was a mistake pretend i didnt say coxie  get out  look i it boggles my mind that you would just bail on a patient  a patient is a stranger in a bed  that you can distance yourself from when you need to  ben is my friend  im gonna try to visit him over the next couple of weeks  but if i cant then thatll be very sad for me  but really itll just mean that im human  oh and newbie  please dont think that youve come here because ben needs me  youre here because youre scared  that you might have to rely on yourself for the first time  and that  that is just the saddest thing of all  i think one of the most universal human experiences is feeling alone  youd never know but theres tons of people  feeling the exact same way  maybe because youre feeling completely abandoned  maybe you realised that you arent as selfsufficient as you thought  maybe you know you shouldve handled something differently  or maybe you arent as good as you thought you were  either way when you hit that low point you have a choice  you can either wallow in selfpity or you can suck it up  its your call  you know what dr wen i dont care if im not the best right now  because im all about the upside and one day  im going to own this place thats right all of this here  all of this right here  is gonna be the chris turk wing  dr kelso i wrote that evaluation it was me elliot didnt write a word  but i wouldve written every word if id had the courage  and the othersideofthetracks upbringing carla did   you want to know what i think of you  you tell him  youre mean  as for me i decided that if dr cox couldnt do it  well then i would have to be the one there for ben   oh thank god  goodbye newbie  so you know whats up  you know this and that hey i met someone   really  yeah  but she took a stool sample so i think she works here  redhead tall   not on the staff no  no  what a strange young lady  are we just gonna sit around here  and make jokes the rest of the day is that the drill  listen if it makes you uncomfortable then you can just bolt again  i think its only fair you hear my end of the story there  all right fine  aw man i love you  but youre a complete wuss  i guess i got a little scared  well let me know if theres anything i can do  to help you through this rough patch  give me a break im not good at this stuff you know that   its ok  i dont like the big conversations  its cool  ive been thinking about death a lot lately  oh you gotta be kidding me  you think its like new york you know  to most people it might have seemed like nothing had changed  well dr murphy   but it had a little  go on  could it be lupus  good job sport  as for ben he actually responded to the chemo and went into remission  hopefully he wont be back but who knows  still thats not what this storys about  its about the day i realised that admitting were not heroic  is when were the most heroic of all  i guess hell always  be a hero to me  always be a hero to me  what a girl  what else we got  theatre camp  bingo
