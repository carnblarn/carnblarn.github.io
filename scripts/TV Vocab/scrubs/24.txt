down with a big ol mug of vodka  mr bober back there is one of our frequent flyers  hes with us every six months for years and ive grown fond of him  so if you could somehow manage to not kill him  well then oh gee that would just be ducky  how come you havent mentioned its my last day as an intern  havent i   come here oh  ok ok  despite the fact that tomorrow you will be a resident  youll still be the excitable girl that you are now  the only difference will be that some new intern  will mistake you for somebody who actually knows something  why is he so uptight today   hey perry  oh

warm bath catch a little bit of that fear factor  ted the reason were not admiring the new parking structure  is because you failed to get legal clearance from the zoning board  honestly sometimes i wonder if youre happy here  do it ted just do it  bob when i heard you were up on the roof  i just assumed it was because your evil mission  here on planet earth had finally come to an end so tell me this  where exactly is the mother ship   look ted its dr cox  hey  i just saw the new shift schedule give me a break will you  im glad youre here the hospital needs a new residency director  and ive decided to recommend you  now finish your tantrum on your own  because im going to go down to the cafeteria and get myself a froyo  ted chopchop  save my spot  bambi mr bobers hypotensive i think hes becoming septic  this guy is more work than all my other patients combined  maybe if you tell him how hard it is on you hell get better  ill get paper towels  dont worry somebody else will get it  yeah who can we get  im not shocked thats how you live your life  got a problem hey just pass it on down the line  i was gonna say something  but it turns out he gave me a pretty good idea  thank you so much for taking bober from me   but jd i  i owe you  im a little doormat i sit and stay  let people use me every single day  excuse me  oh its a song im working on i made it up  so i let myself get taken advantage of sometimes you know  i mean big deal how do you make friends  ive seen your type before  youre that girl that thought she wanted to lose her virginity  at a party while another guy was asleep in the room  chaz really cared for me  and im sure you have a cool tshirt to prove it  can we please finish this physical  and i cant pee right now so youll have to go for me  what a good girl good girl  still elliot wasnt gonna let herself get stuck with mr bober either   how you doing mr bober  fine  ok why did you let elliot turf him up here  i dont know  all i really remember is she dropped her pen and bent over  dude thong city  no no highfive for you   todd did bad  todd did very bad  todd did very very bad  what the hell elliot  you cant just pawn this bober guy off on me  it was jds patient i was just the middleman woman person  we can stand here and argue about who screwed who  or  or nothing im on break lets do it   rockpaperscissors right now  fine loser gets bober  once twice three shoot  did you say bober  im looking for my grandfather frank bober  we moved him to the icu dear hell show you up  thats ok she she didnt hear us  no but jesus did  just a closer walk with thee  i didnt appreciate your game this morning  heavens to betsy the gazpacho is scrumptious today  dangling that fake promotion in front of me  i was dead serious about the residency directors position  well what makes you think that id be interested in that  because you want my job  and youll never get it without this on your rsum  but you hate me   like nuts in brownies captain  i dont get your angle  what could you want in exchange for my support  because im telling you i am not dating that daughter of yours  i only have a son  thats my bad i was just going by that picture on your desk  you know the financial burdens i deal with  i want you to stop busting my chops all the time and get on my team   forget about it  fine walk away  scrumptious  wanna bite  were doctors thats how doctors talk to doctors  our only mistake was not being careful about where we were  we agree we did nothing wrong  so lets check in on him and forget about it  and thats when the three of us realized  even though wed all spent time with mr bober  none of us had any idea what he looked like  over here  hey guys  when we started here a year ago  and saw some of the insensitive and jaded doctors  we all said the same thing  thats not gonna be me   really the only solace  is that the guilt passes pretty quickly  whats wrong dog  you guys we have to do something  if we remove mr bobers gallbladder it should relieve the abdominal pain  isnt he a little old for that procedure   well he seems stable enough  problem is he has no insurance  and then all at once we realized we had to do something  we decided to attack the problem on three fronts  dr cox  ms sullivan  dr wen  i thought if you looked at mr bobers chart and agreed  you might be able to pull some strings or  and now here it comes the calling me a girls name  the telling me not to waste my time  yep ill be more than glad to help you there charlotte  i was half right  well thank you  dont ever be afraid to come to me with stuff like that  the simple fact that you seem to give a crap  is the reason i took an interest in you to begin with  its why i trust you as a doctor hell its  its why i trust you as a person  are you dying  ive got a new shrink  ah just say it  you know i want to thank you for this whole year  oh no  and i just want to know if i can buy you dinner  thatd be terrific   great im off in a half hour  oh no  here i was led to believe that you were  doing a gift certificate kind of thing  but to sit and eat with you thats  thats just thats crazy talk  i have half a mind to issue you a drug test   come on whatd i sign up for  wouldve been nice  he doesnt have insurance if you could talk to the board jd thought maybe  first he dumps that patient on you  and now he wants you to ask me a favour  if you dont start saying no  youre gonna wind up on the playing a game   i call hide the pickle  jd and i are just colleagues  i was joking but you actually slept with him didnt you  a little  i dont know where your mother was when she shouldve told you these things  but you cannot have sex with someone you care about  sex is for making babies and revenge  oh youre so full of it  listen stick if you wanna wipe your nose  and pretend that was a sneeze i will play along  but if you have something to say say it  everybody knows youre sleeping with dr cox  and it cant be about making babies cos youd end up eating them  as for revenge im not sure that pleasuring him  while he watches sportscenter hurts him as much as you think  you still care about him whether you admit it or not  and if you lay one finger on me im blowing my rape whistle  kiss her  so you see dr wen its not really a favour  we were supposed to do surgery on mrs beckerman but she passed away  go on  shes dead and we hoped that you could keep her name on the roster  we dont wanna do surgery on her  lets face it dr wen were good but were not that good   you know what im saying  no  we want to get a patient approved for surgery  we hope you can keep the slot open  oh sure  dr turk next time you need to talk to me  think hard about what you want to say then send her   of course thanks dr wen  see what happened there was  i knew what you were trying to say despite the exact words you were using  i tried to help you out instead of getting mad at you over nothing  baby we both know its not the same  you are the dumbest man i ever laid eyes on  still  didnt hurt didnt hurt  tell me if it hurts this time  so you want me to approve surgery on a 76yearold man  with no insurance and no lifethreatening condition  young man im curious  what did you think the end result of this conversation would be  well pretty much this  except im invested so i thought i might try crying  sport if crying worked on me  my wife would have her own car by now   bob i think you should reconsider  whats that perry  i mean because that didnt sound like something a teammate would say  maybe you meant to pat me on the ass and say go get em bob  right but what if we were to look at this  from a purely fiscal perspective  did he just say fiscal  after all mr bober is here every four to six months  and if we were to consider his surgery  as a onetime expenditure then  you would be making the right financial call  see now thats the kind of thinking i can get behind  howd that make you feel   dirty all over  you get used to it  boys ill do what i can but if youre gonna pull this off  youre gonna need a board member behind you  how the hell are we supposed to get that  this is the closest ive come  to not hating myself after sleeping with you  oh youre just saying that  actually im not i we connected   whats wrong with you  nothing  i guess i was just thinking of a guy i kind of like  let me guess  he is an arrogant selfhating narcissist who just needs to be loved   yeah pretty much  nobody better  hey stud  thank you for not asking me to help on the bober thing  i wouldve but it wouldve been pointless  turns out youre a very predictable woman there   please  i know you  youre gonna walk into that boardroom tonight all tall and strong  and then youre gonna sit back and just pray that nobody asks your opinion  i mean im sure you probably think  that your little visits here are a spontaneous surprise  but did you ever wonder why the only two candles i own  are already lit when you walk in that door  i mean doll i hate to tell you this but i dont walk around  all day with cologne down in my engine room  im not that guy  some people like reliability  in a sedan it turns out its terrific  cheers heres the good news however  turns out its never too late to turn the whole thing around  really  all you gotta do is stir it up a little bit   stir it up  stir it right the hell up   ill try to remember that  so im guessing  ill be seeing you in about 11 days right  probably at the exact same time  dont forget to stir it up baby  and so it comes down to this  the hospital board meeting to decide mr bobers fate  and in a weird way ours too  as cheesy as it sounds  i think we knew we were all gonna be ok  hi mr bober  still ive had this feeling that im forgetting something  hey  congratulations on becoming a resident  glad i could help  help you were awful to me  you awful  anyway go get em tiger  the world is your oyster my friend what  its my first day im waiting for someone  this door is broke  every fifth time or so it dont open  maybe theres a paper clip stuck in there   why a paper clip  i was just making small talk   did you put a paper clip in there  no  if i find a paper clip  youre goin down   heres to the new residents  here here   im a doctor  its been a long year  but the important thing is we got through it together   we were a family  hey everyone   oh hi  how are you  ms sullivan thank you for helping us with mr bober  dont mention it even though i wasnt invited to your party   i brought presents for everyone  brace yourself newbie  carla my exhusband is in love with you  its true ask your boyfriend he knows  he and perry talk about it all the time  i dont know why you havent mentioned this to her  perhaps youre afraid of something huh  and bob when are you gonna tell perry that that promotion  youre making him jump through hoops for was filled months ago  it just seems wrong which brings us to twinkie  if you dont have the courage to tell your colleague dr dorian  that youre still crazy about him  im gonna do it for you cos thats what friends do yeah  and finally perry  you are not gonna believe what happened  the first time i met your little protg here  oh please god no  i slept with him and it was good  hows that for stirring things up  have a great summer everyone bye  yup one big happy family
