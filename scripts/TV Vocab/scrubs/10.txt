future of the relationship depends on how she handles that very moment  im so proud of you bambi  they grow up so fast   dr cox  and there you are   excuse me  i was wondering if theres anything  that

jerk  thanks again for the invite bambi i love photography  photographys for studs  after working at a hospital for a while you develop a sixth sense for danger  maybe theres a mass cas alert maybe theres a code  maybe someone spent the morning  with an annoying patient and needs to vent  luckily i was prepared   you do your prerounds  yes  discharge summaries pharmacy renewals  soap notes central line changes  yes  ok but did you go ahead and fix your beeper  so it doesnt play that annoying song every time you get paged  yes  crap  i expect you to act like  a professional around here  is that all you got  good one  interesting titbit  back during the gold rush when a man staked a claim  if he came upon another man panning his spot  he could shoot that fella dead  without even asking any questions  you dont say  simpler times  what if youve had three great dates and he likes you so much  he hasnt even tried to have sex with you yet  i could sabotage that relationship in two phone calls   i could do it in one  sabotage that relationship  i would ask him why he finds me so repulsive  then coerce him into having phone sex with me  then i would ask him if he thinks we have a future  and then id probably just cry until he hung up on me   we are so alike  i know  oh stop no you stop  oh dear god   ms tracy well go ahead  can you give me one sec  im arranging to have food delivered fatty had a party and nobody came  preaching to the choir  think of what little patience i have  as your virginity  you always thought it would be there until that night  when you were feeling down  and your pal kevin who just wanted to be friends  he dropped by and he brought a copy of about last night  and a fourpack of bartles  jaymes and  it was gone for ever just like my patience is now  so you do scary little speeches   how adorable  this is so much fun  careful rapunzel fun time is officially over  you think you can just treat bambi like that and walk away  get him girlfriend  what up tdog  the only way to avoid the high five with todd  is not to say anything that he can connect to sex  how you doing  thats totally how my car was rocking when i took this girl out last night  am i right  he earned it  pain   so cox tore into you  you know what pisses me off  no one ever calls him on anything  you want to kick and scream  thats fine but if you ever yell at my friend again over nothing  then i will wipe that scary smile off your face  and keep it in my purse until no one around here  is any more scared of you than i am  its not fair why are you eating in here   tmans afraid of kelso  im not afraid of kelso  i just felt like eating in here  go outside and stand up for yourself  hell yeah  you know what else stands up for itself  im not sure but ill guess that its your penis  it is  oh no  everyone we can all relax now the planets have been realigned  and order shall be returned hey you  give me two seconds gotta finish emailing jill  i have your little friends test results  shall we have some fun and take a look  interesting ekg negative tilt table negative  echo negative  nothing in fact is wrong with her but exhaustion brought on by  let it

season  now go  hey you  for what its worth i dont care if your beeper plays  who let the dogs out hoof hoof   as many times as you like  actually sir its who who   but thank you  and by the way  just a real smooth move running to your mommy   excuse me  your mommy crrushed me  she did id like to issue a warning to everybody  and im dead serious  fyl jds mommy has made it clear  that she doesnt want her daughter picked on any more  nothing mean shes a precious flower and we should all be super nice to her  i was paged  hello  anyone  oh hell no  when i get out we should hang  id love to i should warn you  i work a ton and when im off i catch up on paperwork  or read medical journals to stay ahead of the curve  im a nerd  i wish i could stay home and read but my job its like you know  with the marriedbythemillennium thing i go on like 1000 blind dates  and all my friends always need something  theres me who never wants to let anyone down you know ever  with so many balls in the air sometimes it gets a little overwhelming  as soon as i leave i know im going right back to that mess  my god im practically crying how pathetic is that  around here you make big choices every day  i came to tell you were gonna keep you here  for the weekend just to get some rest  most of these choices actually have nothing to do with medicine  its so on  in those cases you have to make sure  that your emotions dont get the best of you  mommy   give me that bambi thats not a toy  my name is not bambi  its dr dorian i dont need to be looked after  how about ill be the doctor and you be the nurse  yes doctor  good choice  i have to go check on something  fix this before word gets around  carla wait  what did you do   what did you do  what did you do  she called me bambi in front of everyone   my name is not bambi  its scooter  short for scooter pie  baby jd is my best friend  but if you need me to kick his ass i will kick his ass cos i care for you   and cos im willing to sleep with you  hell yeah  if i wanted his ass kicked id do it myself  todd  if you ever make that noise at me again  i will reach into your mouth and unscrew that bulb  that barely keeps your brain going  dude chick threats are hot  what did i say about annoying carla  if she makes me choose between you two you know how itll end up  yes i do and i thank you for that  could you be any cuter with the new hair colour  holy cow please no  good morning sunshine  could you possibly excuse me for just one second  dear god youre still here  who exactly is doing this to me  theres nothing worse than knowing youve wronged a friend  and having to apologise   look carla  its ok you overreacted  i shouldve realised you can stand up for yourself  i know you would take it back if you could i do  were ok right   i think ive said all i can  see you tonight for the exhibit   whyd you have me paged  to ask you to forgive me  for what  hello sad clown   thanks for paging her  how could you  he called me cutie and said my eyes were as blue as the ocean  i got confused   it probably wouldve worked on me too  youre damn right it wouldve come  is he single  hello  look at you all proud  dont tell me youve already managed to eat  i took my sweet time too  consider that your last supper im bored with the games   are you forbidding me to sit here  this is a public bench  you are as welcome here as i am but you wont come back again  you know why because you just dont have the mettle  now get out of here so i can eat my wifes egg salad sandwich  before the tomato soaks through the bread  beautiful day  did you get into photography when you were in college or  no actually i never went to college  dont tell any of my patients but neither did i  is that supposed to make me feel better  no it was just a joke  i was doing the whole like turn a frown upsidedown  you know what hold it i dont think were ok  you accepted my apology you cant take it back  have you ever spent time with a woman  is my punishment still coming because the anticipation is killing me   make your case  im sorry what  well you tell me why chorey mccrazy chore  gets to stay here two more nights  ok  you dont know how hard it is for some women to make it alone  jill is so exhausted shes her own worst enemy  constantly trying to please she judges herself harsher than anyone  have you seen what you look like today  im a skank she never says no to anyone so  could you pick up a sample of my dogs stool and take it to the vet for me  i can do it at lunch  its ok jill can stay a little longer  and if were real lucky shell realise that its ok  to give yourself a break every once in a while right  i took a cab from the last stop   you forgot your coat  i dont want it  why would you  i was only gonna go to that exhibit  because i wanted you to think i was brainy   im so angry at myself  thank goodness  i thought you were mad at me  hundreds of interns have decided they dont need me any more why should  this is why you cant be friends with doctors  if its a problem you me elliot and turk will get together  i dont work with turk and im not close to elliot  the only problem here is you ok  were supposed to be friends  your selfesteem is so wrapped up in what you do  a doctor thats all you are thats how you define yourself  you think youre better than me because of it   carla i do not think  admit it  admit it right now or ill never respect you again  ok sometimes thats true   carla youre a good nurse  im a great nurse  you patronising ass  you dont even get it do you  in nine years i never once felt bad about myself  for what i do not for one second  and then i met you   please wait  dont  sometimes the only way to take a good look at yourself  is through someone elses eyes  if youre lucky youll like what you see  impressive  or youll learn from it  if you dont like what you see  you have to hope you havent burned too many bridges  how many meqs of potassium should i give this guy  you know the answer to that dont do that  but thanks bambi  from that moment on i knew id be bambi for ever  see you tomorrow scooter  hes actually very talented
