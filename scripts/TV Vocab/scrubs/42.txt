passiveaggressive aside  ill look into your heart pick out your insecurity  and shine a spotlight on it for the remainder of your days  now riddle me this fido  just exactly why does every asian person whos passing us by  keep giving you the old stinkeye  oh youre imagining things  ow  its just been hard for me lately  i dont really have anyone special in my life  im pretty much either here

pot  we all need to respect each other  if you think a specific ethnic group is loud lazy or sneaky  or incredibly closedminded and inappropriate  exactly just keep it to yourself dammit  what  nothing sir i just thought of something funny  maybe what you should do is saddle up your mop and head upstairs  someone has vomited in the second third and fifthfloor hallways  what its not my fault  ralphie lets ride  good work heres your 20 bucks  you can throw up whenever you want to   hell yeah  we should look into that  you know right after you blow chunks in the elevator   hey stranger  hot

relationships all day long  you know what glare all you want big dog cos im not afraid of you  jordans only paying attention to the baby  must be so hard for dr look at me isnt it  look at me  and you two youre arguing since you got engaged  youre probably the first couple to do that ever  it cant be that youre just scared is it  and you lets just forget for one second that a month ago  you told me you couldnt be in a relationship  because for me its actually fun  to watch you sabotage your relationship from the outside  the only thing that gives me comfort you guys  is while im at home staring at the ceiling  just wishing i had someone to talk to  is knowing none of you idiots realise how lucky you are  did i miss something good   thank you so much for dinner  youre welcome  but what was the deal with tipping 20 on a 30 bill  ah nothing i just love chinese food and the asian people  what should we do now  kiss me  i could do that  mm you went left very cool  thank you rowdy  so its cold outside you wanna come back to my place  i think you might be moving a little fast for yourself  and theres a part of me thats very angry i just said that  im so sick of being alone you know  tell you what look me in the eyes  and tell me that youre ready to start something right now  we wont even need a cab  i will throw you over my shoulder  and just sprint the 12 miles to your house  but  ill call you sometime  i hope you do  bye  i dont think people are meant to be by themselves  thats why if you actually find someone you care about  its important to let go of the little things  even if you cant let go all the way  because nothing sucks more than feeling all alone  no matter how many people are around
