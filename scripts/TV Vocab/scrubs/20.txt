winner  i paid 17 for this steak and im not  you want some  ankles is a simple game  the first one to get embarrassed and pull up their scrubs loses  the problem is these stupid games always end the same way  say it  say it  just say it   im your bitch  yes you are  now sit back baby cos iron chef is on   i win  i wasnt racing   i was just walking in  good clean win tdog  now lets go down to the

pants  no not  im not wearing any pants right now  my pants are over there and theres a note from my gp in the pocket  if you guys need me ill be under here  im in love with that guy and if i dont sleep with him ill kill myself  its inappropriate to jump a patient isnt it   totally  ever done it   tons of times  tons of times what  nothing baby  why hasnt he had a surgical consult im sorry thats my fault  i didnt make it clear how i feel about things that should already be done  i almost always wish things were done already  mr hoffner asked for all his options   he never asked for a surgical consult  could i have a surgical consult  you may have whatever you want  how is that helpful do you get the doctorpatient relationship  were supposed to be a team  you and me were gonna get killed  for the love of our lady of guadalupe that is a fine brew   its just coffee  oh no  this is liquid crack this is a mug full of sunshine  my dear for me this is like sex  is that why you always finish so quickly  and sassy too if you could cook a steak  id eat it right off your bottom  ladies this is that beverage ive been trying to describe to you  and it turns out this is weird  but the secret is you grind it from beans not crap  ill grind your beans  when are we gonna get it over with  we are already understaffed and dr kelso fired two nurses for no reason  forgive us if we dont have time for the dr cox show today  we have to reschedule every nurse   whatll we do about icu  we dont need them  heres the problem with a surgical consult  mr hoffner should be treated medically but a surgeon will want to slice him  surgical and medical interns are like two rival gangs  not real gangs more like those cheesy gangs you see in broadway musicals  surgical medical surgical yeah  still i knew there was one surgical intern i could count on  if you have some moles i will inspect them  ill remove tumours from your brain to your rectum  between the two of us there is no wall  were a surgeon and a doc  above it all  a surgeon and a doc  above it  all  no problem whatever you want me to tell your patient im your guy   how are you feeling  im not tired  stress tests are supposed to be hard  it helps if you visualise running toward something   like your girlfriend  i dont have a girlfriend  how could you possibly be single  i dont know im kind of anal and neurotic  my god me too   really  please  i like to keep my pens in order from least to most ink  that is hot i guess the truth is that  i dont go out a lot you know  i always seem to put my foot in my mouth  id let you put your foot in my mouth  what  i said id let you put your foot in my mouth  thats weird  i know  who gets to tell us the symptoms of mnires disease   dr murphy  can you use it in a sentence  sorry to interrupt you there  but i gotta ask you a quick question now when you were born nay  spawned by the dark prince himself  did he forget to give you a hug before he sent you along your way  because you cant just let nurses go on account of feeling insignificant  and besides with your money  you ought to be able to keep a man tucked away in the closet  and bring him out when you want to knock him around  as you were  doug look away  i cant   what are you serving for dinner  thats not really my area  id like chicken  mr hoffner heres your surgical consult  but hes gonna agree with the medical course i set for you now dr turk  tell mr hoffner whether or not you think he should have surgery  i think he should have surgery  the important thing is that were professionals  and we should behave as such in front of the patient  no tell me he did not fire her  you had to show up kelso and now another nurse is out of a job   i went to confront  am i done  you dont look done   you know what your problem is  i put myself  who answers that question that is your problem  you think you have the answers to everything  but end up throwing gas on the fire and everyone pays the consequences  thats what i was going to say  carla can i talk to you for a second  my god barbie needs you  to be continued  why hasnt he asked me out im single i mentioned five movies i want to see  i drop things so when i pick them up he can see im flexible  elliot these things take time and selfrespect  so were going to focus on time   nobody likes me when they meet me  exactly  im helping   weve got all the time in the world  right   no  i knew it  im dying i was exhausted on that treadmill  i should have said something but i never do  not when it comes to my wellbeing and now im getting a pig heart

years  and no girlfriends its a gassy disease   you cant consider it a reoccurrence  hes high risk for colon cancer   give him frequent colonoscopies  how frequent  youre turning this into a competition  luckily its not up to you its up to mr hoffner  im going with surgery   youre getting meat for dinner  i eat chicken  ill set it up   say it  im your bitch  im not gonna let turk beat me  im gonna fight back and you want to know how  im telling  dr cox  he stole my patient  and then and then  its ok jumbo  now whos my big boy   i am  youre my big boy   youre my big boy  im your big

swing at me   maybe  well if you do id better die  because if i dont i will be coming for you  good cake today  you fired a dear dear friend of mine that woman was like family   who  ill tell you who  coffee nurse  when you fired coffee nurse you made this whole thing personal  no you made it personal  you gave me lip yesterday in front of the interns  you know why i laid off those first two nurses  budgetary constraints forced a cut and those two had negative reports  and you think i did it to make myself happy  i wouldnt notice if they all caught on fire  then why in gods name did you axe coffee nurse  because you were being an ass  youre right that was personal my bad  golly i do love moist cake  where are you going youre not off til midnight  its my last chance and seans only seen me

could i talk to you for a sec  can i let my mind wander or are we doing something  i just wanted to say that im   im sorry  holy crap  my bad behaviour is my own doing  i dont think a nurse should suffer on account of it   then ill make it right  thank you  if you will apologise again so the interns can hear  your call perry  dr kelso  im sorry i was wrong   doug for gods sakes  i dont care its beautiful man  i cannot believe i talked to sean about poo for ten minutes   relax nobody knows  hey poopie  at one point i tried changing the subject to art  but we went from art to artists to alcohol to coffee  and that just led right back to poo  you know the saying no one will love you until you learn to love yourself   my mother used to say no one will love you  fake it dont let him see what a neurotic mess you are  you see turk over there  he doesnt know i cry sometimes because im not sure theres a cat heaven  its hiding the crazy and acting like the most confident girl in the room  no problem  i too decided it was time to act confident and face things headon  that was my patient turk i brought you in as my friend  youre so competitive you just take him from me that sucks   tough  excuse me  youre damn right im competitive thats what makes me a good doctor  i want to win at everything every day and you should too  that sounds like a great friendship  if you dont want to play steak fine this has nothing to do with friendship  youre angry at yourself because you couldnt get the guy to believe in you  he never got the concept of the team  i know  have a cookie man   i win at cookie  yeah   thanks again sir  no matter what the board says  im not going to let someone like you get away not without a fight  you think she doesnt see through you these people know who really cares   you and jennifer are pretty tight  hell yeah  jenny gosh im glad youre back  thanks my names patti  fool  sean  sean wait   is that  no  no this is just muddy water see   you just tasted muddy

yes maam  do you want to go out with me elliot  yes  when most of your time is spent fighting death and illness  you look for any victory you can get even a victory over your own selfdoubt   how cool was that  ok cool it   ill check you later  check you later  im ok  bye  you two are perfect for each other  i got a date i got a date  sometimes your ego leads you into battles you cant possibly win  and sometimes you have to admit that feeling competitive isnt a bad thing  if you believe youre right you have to fight for it  i know its the right way to go and i am not gonna take no for an answer  so what do you say  lets do it  you won now beat it   what  go  lets get you some sherbet  bottom line when the stakes are high go for the win  as long as you dont get caught up in the petty stuff
