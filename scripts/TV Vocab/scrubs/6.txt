going to make it worth your while  weve already slept together  you should be careful about the buildup   is that necessary  yeah  i got something for you  you want to hear it  did you learn that for me  more  the start of a relationship is about three things  control  oh god  dependence  he was released a couple of hours ago  and timing  your mother broke her leg  other than that there arent a lot of surprises  dr cox have you met  you dont have to introduce me to my exwife  surprise  you putz   oh no  hello jordan   oh no no  perry   perry  you never heard that  and i dont have your exwifes bite mark on my neck  dont look her in the eyes shell steal your soul  how are things down in the underworld  good and you still have a rollicking social life  since i cut you loose its been one big party  name some place other than the hospital youve been in the last month  five four three two  my car  on the way to the big party  that must have hurt  i gotta get out of here  anger like this has a way of being passed on to whoevers closest  dr cox i know youre suspended but youre the only one my mother trusts  not now  this is all your fault   turk can i talk  no you cant  thats why theyre called your problems  sorry  happy halloween  thatll teach you not to spy on people during their alone time  when dealing with a crisis everyone knows you go right to the source  god the source is pretty  ms sullivan  excuse me  i think were way past ms sullivan  ok jordan  i dont think we should see each other again  the story of my life any time i let my guard down just a little i get hurt  i am so sorry  you know how long its been since i connected with someone  its not fair that because of him i dont get to spend time  its hard to keep that going  see you dj i got a date see each other again  shes gonna be ok  i dont know mom im just feeling lost  everyone here is so busy and i guess im just kind of lonely  could you just try to hear what im saying just this once  no i dont have short hair  yes i know short hair gives me pigface  yeah   dr cox  ok linus  youre too excited get your blankie go in a corner and take a timeout  nondisplaced femoral fracture carlas moms gonna be fine   ok what  your exwife   shes the answer  things that ruined my life  things with sharp edges  shes on the board im sure shes a reasonable person  not that i know her or have been alone with her   but if you just  no   ask  im going to go and do this  as slowly as possible so you dont misunderstand  no  i wonder if he wants me to ask her  fine ill ask her  thats a no   its always funny  cant believe shes sleeping  shes had two valium   why was she in a lot of pain  no she just wouldnt shut up  im sorry  i notice your little boyfriends names not on the cast  making me leave her alone like that  she would have gotten hurt whether you were there or not  she fell in the shower  so unless you have an extremely disturbing relationship   im afraid youre full of crap  im full of crap  if you dont care about being suspended why are you here  you dont scare me with those crazy eyes  shes an excuse to not take chances   youre only happy when youre here  youre afraid to live your own life  admit that losing this place would kill you   we done  thats all i got  crazy eyes  low blow  there are other ways to save dr coxs job  i could try talking to dr kelso  cox could get plastic surgery to look like jimmie walker  this guys gonna need 30meqs of kcl  or i could just ask jimmie walker to talk to dr kelso  your man cox is the best i know hes got an unorthodox way of doing things  but all the innovators do  now everybody deserves a second chance  am i right  who are you  or i could get back to the problem at hand  i know youre on your way to the board meeting  and i know you dont really like me but  i dont dislike you i nothing you  thanks thats special i have to ask you a favour  but this is not why we slept together  you had nothing to do with why we slept together  i think we both know thats not completely true  even though youre terrified dr cox will find out  if i wanted you to have sex with me in front of him you would  please dont do that  you remind me of him when he was younger  then see if you can dig up sympathy  for someone who means a whole lot to me and probably means a little to you too   so will you help him  ah sweetie  no   i went to therapy once  you did  yeah once though like back in 93 to 94  then a few months in 95  and then i went to group which was a disaster  when i went to college it was my first time away from home  things started piling up and i felt i was sinking   yeah  and no matter how embarrassing  you think it might be its always helpful to talk to someone neutral  for example take a look at me i am now thanks to therapy  in a healthy relationship with a beautiful woman  who wont sleep over because she thinks i broke her mothers leg  baby  how long were you back there for a second huh   i wasnt talking about us  turk  moms spending the night here so i will spend the night with you  only we have to leave right now  go  sometimes no matter how badly you want to stop something  theres nothing you can do to stop it  the board of directors of sacred heart  is behind that door sipping water and killing the career of dr cox  yes i am bulletproof   hes taking it well  so no hard feelings   careful  catch you on the flip side  i really think youre making a big mistake   the most destructive thing about dr  yawn  i say yawn because when i actually yawn you dont get it  see you in hell  i dont know why she did it maybe i got to her  maybe she knows how much the hospital needs him  maybe she remembers why she cared about him in the first place  i did it cos the thought of you rotting here in this fluorescent tomb  is more fun than tipping a valet with your alimony cheque  listen pumpkin if youre having this much trouble getting over me  just go ahead and give me a call  and ill toss you a sympathy throwdown any time  it made me realise every ending leads to new complications  new problems to be dealt with  im watching that   new issues  thanks dr greenberg  see you next week   she was never boring  what happened  you marry somebody like your mother then remember you hate your mother  you asked her for help didnt you  you dont realise how important you are around here  ill always remember that as the first thankyou i got from dr cox  jeez agnes does the fieldhockey team know that youre missing  it felt good  although it did take some stones to be honest  stick with the truth and you cant get hurt always been my philosophy   you didnt sleep with her did you  god no  philosophy is tricky
