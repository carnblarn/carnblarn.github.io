thing you dont throw around loose trash  and i wont have to waste an entire workday granting the wishes  of imaginary fisherman kay  dude im not scared of you lifes too good im untouchable  thats what i hoped youd say  dr murphy how about you start us off by describing  the medical condition of your patient mr eronson here  hes got hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with severe secondary pulmonary hypertension  wrong hes dead another one bites the dust huh sport  next contestant dr reid  mr murdock was admitted with a copd exacerbation  he responded well to antibiotics and bronchial dilators but he did develop a rash  on his umprivate area  sorry on his what  his peepers  excuse me  his schwingschwong  dr reid its bad enough you run out on a patient in the middle of a pelvic exam  but you are a doctor and you need to be able to say simple clinical words  like penis or vagina or anal  anal is not a dirty word sir  tell that to my wife  the uh the biopsys back and im afraid its positive for prostate cancer  rats excuse my language dear you know what catherine  i can see this conversation being riddled with that kind of talk  perhaps you should wait out in the hallway  uh you know sir i know that its cancer but im not really worried  excuse me am i confusing cancer with some other disease  no youre not i think what captain bedside here  is _trying_ to say is that it hasnt spread to the lymph nodes yet  so its still quite easily operable  yes and theres an opening in surgery tonight i managed to jam you in  look i know this is happening awfully fast you must have a lot of emotions  swirling around but i want you to know if you have any questions at all im here  do you know what channel that queer guy show is on  its okay tell him  bravo tuesdays at 10  oh lookathat message from jordan  hows it going  just great  hey watch it  dr cox weve known each other for over two years  let me in okay help me help you help me help you help me help you  stop it  fine newbie let melet me tell you a little story it starts every day  at 5 in the morning  which is just about the time that youre setting your hair for work   when i am awakened by a sound is that a cat being gutted by a fishing knife  nooo thats my son hes hungry and hes got a load in his pants so big  that im actually considering hiring a stable boy but i go ahead and dig in  because i do love the lad and well gosh you know me im a giver  and im off to the hospital where my cup runneth over with both quality colleagues  such as yourself and a proverbial clowncar full of sick people  but what the hey my pay is about the same as guys who break rocks with other rocks  and i only have to work three or four hundred hours a week so so far im a pretty happy camper  and then i head back home where im greeted by the faint musk of baby vomit in a house  that used to smell like wellnothing nothing nothing iiin fact it used  to smell like nothing at all and all i want to do before i restart this whole glorious cycle is  you know maybe lay on the couch and have a beer and watch some sportscenter and  im if im not too sweaty from the days labors stick my hand right down my pants  buuut apparently thats not in jordans definition of pulling your weight  so uh there you are superstar fix that  well thats easy just tell her about it tell her everything you feel  should i give her every reason to accept that im for real  first of all no one understands relationships like billy joel okay  uptown girl got me through high school  long story for another day  secondly you dont want to end up like the randolphs back there  just not saying a word to each other do you  you wish _we_ were more like the randolphs dont you  god save me i do i reeeeally do  come here  so heres your surprise you know well be getting married in six months  and i just thought it would be sohot  yeah  if we didnt have sex again until our wedding night  can you imagine how great that night will be  so great um how about this though how aboutyou stop having sex but i keep having sex  you mean like an affair  no ill just have sex with you when youre sleeping  turk how can you not think this idea is so romantic  maybe you got me confused with that little amish boy you used to date  untouchable eh  hey dr kelso none of my patients have died today  really mr fergusons corpse begs to differ  darn it  oh and dr reid your patient mrs burke has developed a urinary infection  apparently it hurts when she makes wizziewinkles through her seabiscuit  you know its not my fault that dirty stuff makes me uncomfortable  oh whos fault is it  but more important than anything more important than never letting yourself get fat  is never let a man put his dirty howdoyoudo into your bajingo  jorge i need to see you in the potting shed  she was always yelling at jorge in that potting shed but she never fired him  even after he kidnapped her and took her to acapulco  jd how am i supposed to reverse  this is a job for miss busybody smartypants  i know what you have to do and im gonna help you through this  dude im dying here  turk its been like eighteen hours since you had sex  im saying this is torture  so why dont you just like take care of yoself  man you know i dont do that  you dont  nah i only did that like twice in my life  same here  if by in my life you mean since dinner  i gotta go to sleep im tired  ohhhhh my little newbiedoobiedoo say that whole telling jordan how i feel thing  just went terrific thank you for that now i need a place to crash wheres naomis bedroom  good night roomies  we gotta get that lock fixed  the only lock i gotta get fixed is the one connected to carlas panties  i need to get a key i need to call a locksmith i thought i was the locksmith man  then she cut me off man just like that full prison lockdown no one gets in or out  man thats tough  if youre not gonna use my bed can i use it  no you may not on account of this whole jordan situation being your fault  you told her that spending the day with the baby isnt really a job  and that its turned her into an inflexible shrew  newbie you told me to tell her exactly how i feel i did just that  now youll remain on the floor until you come up with a new plan for me  you know dr cox ii know this is tough on you what with you being psychotic  and all but im out okay its 3 am and theres nothing in the world  thats gonna keep me from going to sleep right now  what do you mean you changed your mind about surgery  catherine downloaded some information on alternative treatments  diet exercise seed implants  no sir those are at best a stall now i know theres trepidation  when you talk about surgery in the area of the penis  whoa quick pause on the guttertalk catherine hallway  look i  go  i know there are possible sideeffects but the incontinence goes away  with most patients and sexual dysfunction can be treated with anything  from viagra to a penis pump  penis pump that sounds awkward  doesnt have to be  wow its a giraffe  end of discussion im not having the surgery although i dont mind that  theyve shaved me already proportionately everything seems muchgrander  all right elliot you just have to ease into it okay lets forget about patients  for now and start with this  ohh my god shes got a tattoo of a teardrop on her bajingo is it sad  her _vagina_ elliot she has a tattoo on her beautiful vagina  awwwh this just isnt fair not fair at all its ridiculous  this is stupid  elliot im just trying to help  yeah you know what carla i dont remember asking for your help okay  it does look a little sad they always do  hey  this is a hospital why are you playing that song  ohh you mean we dont have to take our clothes off  jermaine stewarts classic anthem to platonic love no reason  whatever it is youre trying to do its not working  course not not with you youre uhwhatd you say  untouchable well anyway back to work  new friend  mr greenberg needs 24 milliunits of penicillin im  why does he have a spinkle in his gherkin  carla youre right okay that stuff makes me uncomfortable  and there was a time when that wouldve sent me into a shame spiral  but now im just gonna get over it at my own pace and until then  i honestly dont mind that youre making fun of me but what does bother me  is that no one is ever allowed to make fun of you  people can make fun of me  come on what about that delivery guy yesterday i mean you practically tore him a new binglebore  but hes not my friend my friends can make fun of me whenever they want  really well then in that case youre a knowitall smartypants  and if youre not telling someone what to do youre probably not talking  okay i guess i can be a little bossy  a little girl please if you met jesus hisself youd be trying  to tell him where to park his donkey  oh are we allowed to do this now what about that whole like hands on the hips  carla from the block thing she does when shes mad  when shes like  oh bambi you do _not_ want to mess me with right now  you do sound like that  careful doug we are not that close yet  careful doug  doug you better be careful cause im carla  mr randolph  whats he doing here you know i dont like these people  surgeons not africanamericans  oh were actually saying black now sir  i was right catherine  listen sir i brought dr turk here to help you get over your fear of surgery  im not scared  then what is it  i dont know if youve noticed but catherine and i dont always communicate that well  no i cant  youre joshing  no its true but when i lay that beautiful woman down onto our bed to make love  wow  oh god  the walls come tumbling down its the one place that i can tell her how wonderful  and beautiful she is and how i would be lost without her  now i know i will probably have to have this surgery eventually  but until then i am not going to risk losing the one thing that keeps me close to her  not until i absolutely have to  yes dear you can come in  maybe the dirty little secret about sex is that it isnt so dirty after all  do you think you could try to be a tiny bit mature  oh this is me mature  uh excuse me  whaaat  okay so theres that uh look i realize i let you down before  and i was thinking i could make it up to you by you know maybe babysitting sometime  the weird thing is even though its natural sex can make us uncomfortable  you have apenis and ihave a vagina  that is so hot  but if we work at it we can get beyond that discomfort  and realize that sex can actually be a comfort  hey baby i was just with a patient who made me understand what romance really means  so as far as this nosex thing goes im with you a hundred percent  everyone i know just spent the last two hours listing my faults i wanna have sex now  ill get the condoms  sorry  sex can even be a cure  whoa that was well why were you so angry at me  oh i dont even remember  how do i know all this because no one understands how important sex is better  than someone who isnt having any  helloooo cinemax
