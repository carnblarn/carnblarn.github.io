oldschool   but sir i dont  scalpel ill get the kit  somebody  so often in a hospital you feel youre alone on an island  whether its because you cant bring yourself to make an important decision  or because youre waiting for an answer  or because you know a secret you wish you didnt  i was on that island because somebody else put me there  ok cmon now just cut through good  open up the vein but be careful not to nick the carotid artery   oh boy  oh no  the vascular surgeon said pick up your patient this evening  he also said he could give you a loaner patient  if you needed someone to butcher until then but i didnt get it   no one expects you to son  ok thanks  this sucks but as bad as i feel  dr townshend feels even worse for making me do the procedure  dont worry about it ill take the blame  he hides it well  do you really think he wants to get married  any guy willing to scour the face of the earth  to find the worlds smallest diamond ring  clearly knows exactly what he wants  i dont know if hes mature enough  he couldnt stop giggling when he had to operate on mr wiener   its a funny name  stop it  look the guy is 27 years old hes a surgeon  involved in a longterm monogamous relationship  as much as id love to trash him im not down with the maturity thing  barbie i need you to go to the lab and get mrs millers bloodwork  i also need you to disimpact mr burnett in 317  and what did you say the sex of the child was  you do those things and when youre done  ill think about telling you the sex  seems you went to a swap meet and got yourself a bigboy spine   you tell or else  or else what  youll treat me worse than you usually do  heres the inside scoop i have leverage youre familiar with leverage  youll need it when you disimpact mr burnett  who is so locked up hes been eating gum rubber cement or cork   look barbie  yeah thats not my name  fine doctor  reid really   what  nothing  elliot reid in the house  sit   oh no thanks ill just  im not asking  this

for each of us including our new member  help margo to find her way home tonight  still something was bothering me  how many more times will you make me apologise  for introducing you to your wife   once a month until shes dead  sir do you have a second  sport what did i tell you about my opendoor policy   i dont have one  dr kelso  i was the one who nicked the artery on mr singer  cheese on rye son i just said it was me  shape up son lord knows youre never gonna get by on your looks  right first of all at the very least im interestinglooking all right  and secondly i feel i made that mistake  because dr townshend forced me to perform a procedure  that is unsafe and outdated  sorry townsie  let me get this straight  you screwed up doing something you should be able to handle  and now youre here to tattle on the guy whos taking the bullet for you  is that right  do me a favour will you son grab that for me  thanks  im sorry sir   kelly clamp  kelly clamp coming right up  hey rowdy   you seem distracted something wrong  no sir i call everyone rowdy  want me to leave him in the car  you freaked out my girlfriend you want to get me fired   why not smack me in my face  fine check this out  i cant believe this attitude ive taken care of you your entire life  and i tell you that im getting divorced and you make it about you  you didnt seem too broken up about it why should i care  she left me ok  all righty there dr leverage listen up because heres the real inside scoop  i could literally sculpt a gigantic mr burnett  out of what i just removed from mr burnett  so i think its in your interest for you to start talking  should i get the child a baseball glove or a tutu   girls can play baseball too  i know what girls can do  youve come a long way baby spill doll  i really think you should think about this  so i wrote it down and i put it in an envelope  and then i gave it to her  hi honey  oh you are just so going to pay for this  yeah well so are you  bend over baby  i think mr singers gonna be just fine  oh jeez bob dont creep up on me like that  i almost dropped some fruit in my looms  im sorry buddy  say listen nowadays it has become kind of hospital protocol  to do a modified seldinger in a case like this  you do know how to do one of those dont you   of course  good  because the patient in bed number two needs one  you mind doing it for me  what the hells this all about  nothing i was just looking over your files  and well  your oesteoporotic patients arent on bisphosphonates  your diabetics arent on ace inhibitors  doug a lot of your treatments are pretty out of date  cmon bob guys like us were set in our ways  this is not an age thing doug  these days if youre out of med school five years  half of what you learned is obsolete  why do i spend every other weekend at a seminar  in some twostar hotel ballroom that still stinks of last nights prom vomit  i do it because i have to keep up  also it gives you two days away from the missus right  once again sorry i was the one who introduced you in the first place  look bob i just  i dont have the energy for all that stuff  well  then we got a problem  so you want to talk about what happened  no man look its just too depressing  youre in a bad place but youll get through it give it time  what am i supposed to do until then  barkeep im going to need these two glasses and that bottle of whiskey  excuse me my brother definitely needs to borrow your hat  and for the love of all that is holy  would somebody please put on some country   we are a horrible couple  you couldnt be more wrong  even though that isnt my kid in there i still want to feel connected  and i just thought id be more hooked in if i knew  its funny  every time i think youre the same old sharpedged jackass  you turn around and do something to remind me that youre such a pansy  listen i was hoping the two of us could find out when the baby comes  but if you really need to know now just keep it to yourself  run away there missy cos guilt trips dont work on old perrerino  if youre still standing there when i turn around  im gonna have them erase your name too  goodnight sir  its not always easy to do the right thing  this is to my brother yall my brother  like putting someone elses feelings first for a change  even if it goes against what you really want  no  of course theres always ramifications  my car  you think its my fault he got fired   why would you say that  no reason  lets see you drive home now mr doctor man  troy i said just stand there didnt i  yeah  i may have to get rid of the guy  even if you do the right thing theres no guarantee itll turn out right  he aint heavy hes my brother  shes not with him  and she aint with me shes with rowdy not like that  because even something as harmless as 20 or 30 drinks with your brother  can end up biting you on the ass
