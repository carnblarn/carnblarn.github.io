yeah not all surgeons are stupid ok  fig sack here went to dartmouth  wait youre aardvark  schmitty  hey bobcat welcome back  look it this whole thing was a joke that admittedly  got a little out of hand  in the meantime this blank cheque ought to cover the damage  a joke  think its funny they already gave away my parking spot  or that one of the surgeons paid his dwarf cousin lance  200 to show up at rounds and sing dingdong kelsos dead   and there it is  there what is  this whole ldontcarewhat peoplethinkaboutme act  its pretty convincing  but methinks theres a sad little cartoon boy  living inside the hairy beast  hes sad because at the end of the day he realises the only thing people think  is what an evil sonofabitch he really is  see you later bobigator  if this cheque bounces im coming for you  how you doing ted  ok heres what you do  say that even though our relationship is ending  you dont have any regrets  my god are you actually telling me how to break up with you  youre right go ahead  if you could just start me off thatd be super  just tell me we had a lot of fun together  we did   mostly you were really happy  i was  say that you wished you were mature enough  to talk to me about what was bothering you  because even though i can be controlling sometimes  i really would have worked on it for someone as special as you  you know whats funny when i said i love you  it was an accident and i never really loved you at all  that is an absolute riot  no i just mean that i wonder how things wouldve gone  if that had never happened  me too  hi can i buy you a
