for the life of me i cant remember where   dont worry ill take care of it  thanks bathroom  does this nametag say chief of medicine   yes sir  funny  that couple thought it said im bob ask me about your babys johnson  dammit in my hospital we do not go out on a limb with our opinions  so if a patient has questions in your hospital you just ignore them  look stay away from definite answers leave yourself some wiggle room  say things like well do what we can or well get back to you on that   or hell i dont know  couldnt think of a third one  that was the third one  assface  hey chum what do you say  i wanted to tell you not to worry about getting that cat scan on mrs creeden  ill just rip her stitches open jam my head in and have a look for myself  when i tell you to do something you better get it done  it sucks being yelled at especially when its someone elses fault  that was big of you to cover for elliot  i had a good mind to spank her yesterday  she screw up with your patients too   no  elliot seems so frazzled  she keeps making one mistake after another  i mean i wish i could help her out  i have no idea how that woman handles the stress  i feel so much better   see ya bud  later dude  mr woodburys son is getting married hes asking if hes gonna be able to go  hes got a nasty case of pneumonia lets see  his leukocytosis has resolved his blood cultures are negative  tell

youre so very welcome   its my pleasure  this is great  ok just give her a casual nod  you dont want turk to know whats going on   youre hitting that  how do you do that  its a gift remember last time you two got together  relax were just having fun  what are you guys just sex buddies  fashizzle  i dont wanna get dr phil on you  but women have a hard time separating sex from emotions  you may think youre tapping that right now  but pretty soon shes gonna be like jd i need you  if it got that emotional id break it off  ok oh by the way dude right there  is totally hitting that dude hes totally hitting him   you are good  i know  im so glad esteban found someone  whats up laverne  this friday my church groups doing a production of rent if you wanna go  whats up that doesnt make me want to shoot myself  hows mr lawrence doing  thats no longer any of your business  hes not your patient as of two oclock this afternoon  he asked for a new doctor  the second to switch off of my service today why  they were so overwhelmed by the high quality of your care  they couldnt stand it another second  i wont let you make me feel like crap today  every doctor has had patients switch off of them for no reason at all  and it is just some dumb coinkydink  it happened to me twice on the same day  if you will excuse me i have to check on mrs finnegans chest xrays  no you dont she switched off too  around here things can turn bad in a heartbeat  mr woodbury is still requiring a lot of o2  we have to keep him here over the weekend give him the skinny will you  i guess when you work in a world of uncertainty  its great to have something at home you can count on  elliot what are you doing  just sitting in the dark crying so you know the usual  jd i had such a crappy day i really need you right now come here  she needsyou oh my god turk was right  stop kissing her and put an end to this before she gets hurt  is there something wrong  ah shes a tough kid you can tell her later  nope  what did you do all right dont panic  maybe she didnt enjoy it oh come on whore you kidding  i dont get it why are so many patients switching off on me  are my hands that cold   you didnt tell anyone im republican  no  this cant be happening im a doctor  what use is being a doctor if nobody lets you treat them  what is going on with my life  this is not the time to talk it out  get out of the situation without making her suspicious  hello  hi mom  yeah i miss you too i havent spoken to you in so long  hi mr turk no chris isnt here  no no sir i didnt say mom  i said mon like hey mon we be jamming  no sir i dont think all black people are jamaican  i love you too mommy  sir could you call back later chris will be home  theres been some breakins i had to change the locks on these lockers  you shouldve gotten your new combination  well i didnt do you know what it is   yeah  but youre not gonna tell me  cant janitorlocker confidentiality  he made that up  are you watching sesame street  when i was a kid i had my first sex dream about mr hooper  at least i think it was a sex dream   he was trying to choke me  yeah thats sweet   are you on a break  i have nothing else to do  none of my patients wanna see me  thats a good thing now you have time to take care of your life  why are you being so weird  well of course that could be because hes shaving his dome so much lately  that the hairs starting to grow inward its an affliction known as the infro  but if i were to guess just exactly why  hes been acting weird lately i would say its because  hes the one whos been steering your patients away from you  discuss  carla has to give mr woodbury the bad news   how bad could it be  here she is  i wonder how hell take it  take her out the window throw her out the window  here goes  mr woodburys doing well enough to be discharged  i dont mind standing up to kelso on this one  time to take the gr off my gratitude and give him some attitude jd style   his office is that way  i have to throw up first   what the hell turk  good barbie   now really access the anger  how could you do that to me  yeah honestly how could you  i wanted to protect you give you a break  the old im trying to help you gambit barbie see through that  yo kick him right now  elliot i am sorry  nows your chance youre at work she wont get emotional  walk in and tell her things are getting too serious just butter her up first  look at you miss no one wants me to be their doctor again  i dont see mr ellis here complaining   hes in a coma  elliot we should talk  turk was telling my patients to switch off of my service  what  yeah he said he was trying to protect me  ill go talk to him  that iv looks like its infiltrating the nurse must have screwed up  i did that  whats with the mouthful of chicklets sweetheart   no special reason  really  i thought it might be because dr dorian came to see me  with his feathers all up and his voice acrackin  and told me he was letting mr woodbury go   oh did he  yup  his knees were knocking so loud i almost didnt see you  above him pulling the strings   look dr kelso  maybe mr woodbury will be fine  maybe hell be back in a few days even worse for wear  because you rushed him out who knows  but darn it all if what i dont think is the bigger question  is why you even give a hoot  well actually sir i have this little problem with caring for my patients  still if you decide later that what you really care about  is how much your patients like you  you can change your mind about letting mr woodbury leave  hell ill even back you up   apologise  apologise to you  to richard that was his basketball  hello richard tomorrow at lunch ill bring you a new basketball  and a hoagie  this is about elliot  dont you wanna hear my side of the story with your sex buddy   no  come on wheres the love  wheres the loyalty wheres the automatically  siding with the person you care about the most  oh my god thats what youre doing isnt it isnt it  some realisations stop you in your tracks  others can lead you in new directions  dr cox i just wanted to let you know that turk  did the right thing by taking my patients off of my service  no what that yellowbellied scalpel jock should have done  was go to surgery and schedule himself for an earlymorning addapairdomy  that way if it took hed have the stones  to come and talk to you next time he had a problem  i cant seem to stop letting my life out there affect my life in here  well hell barbie look at me its not like ive always been  the welladjusted guy smiley you see walking down the halls of this dump  stuff like that takes time but eventually you learn  to keep your personal problems separate from this place   so what do i do until then  get your damn life in order  and barbie lets say word got out that uncle cox was doling out the feelgoods  ill make you pay you have no idea  huge  its a funny thing when were forced to see ourselves in a new light  mr woodbury hold on a sec  hopefully you see yourself in time to make a change  were not comfortable discharging you just yet im really really sorry  hopefully youll be respected for it  you evil little witch  let me see that chart nurse  well i see no reason we should keep mr woodbury any longer  enjoy your sons wedding cherish the moments  thank you so much dr  kelso bob kelso   bye bob  glad i could help  sometimes the new light opens your eyes  to something youve known in your heart all along  it just feels like every day keeps getting worse   whats all this  i just felt like taking care of you  this is so nice  its nice because its the beginning of something   i cant do this  ok less tongue  no this you know sex buddies  dr cox and i were talking and my life is just so scattered right now i just  i just cant seem to grab a toehold you know  and i know myself and if we keep doing this  im wont be able to separate the sex from my feelings  and well end up being a couple again  and neither one of us wants that right  i mean i know i dont  me neither  so what do we do  its no big deal you get your stuff out of my room and you crash on the couch  thanks
