becks triad  it keeps me on top of my game  looks like a break in the ulna right there  its good to be the king  you know its ok to be impressed by me most girls are  the problem with reaching the top is sooner or later  someone starts nipping at your heels  for me that guy was nick murdoch  well the gurney adds drama  so thats the guy who wants to take me down  of course youll have a scar peter  youre not getting surgery but chicks dig scars so im gonna give you one  doctor peters drug rash is getting a lot worse  no problem give him prednisone  good bedside manner good rapport with the nurses  sees me staring at him  act busy  thats the stud right there thats where youd  hang a painting  he was born john dorian but he was simply known as jd  doctor friend lover   hey man how are ya  hey how are you  ok there that is  gosh can you believe were doctors  the other night at a restaurant this guy starts choking  they asked if anyone was a doctor i didnt even move  i still feel like im seven years old playing mash with my older brother  i dont want to be hot lips again  shut up and kiss frank  i dont talk to my brother much  what you doing dont connect with him   well ill see you  ok  what happened to that guy  eventually i remembered i was a doctor  hed been dead for 20 minutes very embarrassing  food was good though  dont laugh dont laugh  damn  any time you wanna get more

he look back why doesnt he like me  i cant believe i already blew it  it felt weird trying to push nick on her this morning i wanted to kill him  hes so nice he probably wouldve helped me  come on jd youre not closing the windpipe put more pressure down here  come on i know you can do it come on come on  if it isnt the brain trust  someone tell me what this patients rash is  you have until i

doesnt mean anything  you flipped a coin in your head  no its just that right now hes better at internal medicine than you  ok insult me like you always do  too easy when you least expect it  dr wen threatened to sew my butt cheeks together   yet you continue to eat chilli  dude im taking the cheese off  even though nothing happened today it still kinda freaked me out  one hiccup and thats the difference between life and death  its a lot to have on your shoulders you know  what are you guys talking about  cheese  turk is so lucky i met him first  hows my man doing  baby most guys are here  but me im like all up in here  dr turk you can make the incision now  sir my hands tightening up   i must be low on potassium  all right ill take over  dr murdoch peters rash has gone but hes vomited six times in the last hour  no problem give him zofran and a 20cc per kilo bolus of normal saline  everyones finally coming around to my way of thinking about nick  youre right he definitely has a cute little butt  its almost like its been sculpted  who cares everybodys got a cute butt i have a cute butt  you should bring it in some day   hows turk doing  hes fine why  he totally froze during surgery yesterday didnt he tell you  i feel like we havent talked in ages how are you   fine  yeah  dont i look ok you know  you know im fine as a matter of fact  i am doin ok i am doin ok  good afternoon doctors  ive gathered you all here because well  attendance at my noon conferences has been very disappointing  ive begun to wonder if maybe you have something more important to do  maybe you feel the need to sneak off and have a little nappynap  i love nappynaps  or maybe youve forgotten that my conferences are mandatory  my hospital my rules  ive never missed one batting 1000 over here  im more proud of you than ive ever been of an intern  how do you like me now nick  so you see sir the poor attendance is my fault and my fault only  well then you have just won the privilege  of writing my next ten lectures by this afternoon  paging dr martyr   what the hell was that guy  way to go man  nick that was amazing  thinking  its good to be the king  things change when youre not the star any more  what can i say the lectures this kid wrote were fantastic  the hospital starts to seem like a whole different place  hey man want some company  no i just wanna be alone   well  not yet but soon  very soon  why would turk talk to elliot about this and not me  theyre not friends know what i mean  after 25 minutes the only way i could know what you mean more  is if you wrote my boyfriend doesnt open up to me on a mallet  and smashed me over the head with it  why cant you just for once dig down in your heart  access some emotions and empathise with me   im sorry what were we doing  thats why no one likes you  you like me a little bit  and so do you sweet cakes  want a little sugar from daddy  well looky here i thought this was my special place  id ask you not to tell the others about this spot  but none of them are talking to you  its been a rough day sir  you see dr dorian your problem is youre a pansy  if you were in my way id throw you off this ledge right now  were out here alone  no one would ever know  im gonna im gonna i have to  things  interns are fun  im single  that was more subtle in my head  relax i already left a message on your machine asking you out   really  no   but i will before you go home  works for me  dr murdoch peters developed a highgrade fever and a cough  no problem give him ceftazidime one gram iv   how do you stay positive  i dont let the bad stuff in  try not to get too overwhelmed  call me tonight when you get my message  his butt  so listen ive scheduled an appendectomy for you later  make sure youre good on potassium  i got so much potassium its coming out of my assium  you know what i mean  what i did was i took the word potassium and  i dropped the first three letters  made a doody joke  funny stuff   looks like he bought it  excuse me  so you had stage fright no big deal happened to me once  really  id be more than glad to tell you what a lot of doctors do to relieve the stress  take a little trip to palmdale   what  ok  give yourself the old low five   im not getting it  physician  love thyself  you talking about downtown lester brown  lowers the heart rate releases endorphins basic physiology  ok you almost had me   youre not serious  yes i am   no youre not  yes  no  nobody hurts carla and gets away with it  whos carla  i was talking to myself dont eavesdrop  if this kid doesnt leave im gonna kill him  now if you leave ill know you were eavesdropping  and ill go and kill you anyway  stay good girl  tick tock clarice  kelsos talk helped me figure out what i had to do  good timing give me a hand with this foley cath will you  whether or not nick knew how jealous and competitive id been  i felt i needed to step up lay it out there  and apologise like a man  are we cool  yeah  besides even if i was the star for a little while hes the man now  this belongs to you  thanks a lot man can you grab me some tape  once you line up behind a strong leader everyone picks up their game  we need the results of this urine sample  we began to function like a welloiled machine  nick i got the results back from the  nick  his blood cultures dont look good at all  no problem  listen i was thinking about what happened earlier and  anyway here  you dug down in your heart and came up with a muffin  thats storebought blueberries the size of your fist  i shouldnt have dragged you into it you dont know turk  actually i met him today we had a terrific chat  give the man a hand thats just terrific work  you know darn well that felt good  feeling better about yourself arent you  real nice guy  its hard letting yourself be vulnerable with someone you know  just eat the damn muffin  even though im on call tonight im not gonna let the bad stuff in  not gonna let myself get overwhelmed what  friday when you had people over you locked yourself in your room   because we brought the wrong chips  look at me  that was the old elliot  help me find dr murdoch peters parents are here hes not answering his page  sure you know elliots not gonna let herself be overwhelmed any more  shes been drinking   you look great  youre not messing with me  no but id like to  turk bought me this dress out of the blue i guess he knew id love it  look carla back when i was an intern  i remember the pressure being so insane  that the only way i could get by was to race home  and although my wife was asleep id wake her look her in the eyes  and then passiveaggressively torture her  until she packed a bag and went to her moms for the week  does thathelp  like a big hug with words  just cos a guy has problems expressing himself  that doesnt mean he doesnt need  you  women so dont get me  its not even funny its mindboggling quite frankly  the whole thing is stunning  the point is that its the scrubs right  because in jeans my butt is a force to be reckoned with   we were looking for you  nick touch my butt please  are you all right  that kid is eventually gonna die  whether its today or tomorrow  or a month from now  theres nothing i can do nothing works  his parents wanna talk to me what am i supposed to say  peter lived a good long seven years seven years man  its not fair i hate this place this job   nick its not your fault  i cant do it any more  im done im done  the scariest thing was i thought he was stronger than all of us  maybe its not about being the best  maybe its about finding little things that get you through the day  whether its the support of someone close to you  or letting yourself feel overwhelmed  if only for a moment  or being selfless every once in a while  i dont know  i guess in the end its about surviving  any way you can  see you tomorrow  youre stupid   thats it  give it time itll eat at you   am i stupid  yeah a little bit  damn him
