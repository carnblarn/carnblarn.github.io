actually care  which is just so wrong god  the thing is i dont need a buddy  what i need is a father  you definitely need something  maybe a backbone or perhaps some testicles  at the very least a pillow that you could carry around the hospital  and just cry your sad eyes out into whenever trauma  i have testicles  hes a kidder  all right this is it  brace yourself and let me handle this nice and smooth  all right hey mom guess what  hi mrs turk im gonna cut to the chase  im carla i apologise if your son hasnt told you about me  i dont know how youve put up with him as long as you did

thats when it happened  you should see him when i pretend to let himmake a decision  thats when carla realised she was exactly like turks mom  great job at rounds today dr reid   thank you sir  your dad mustve been very impressed  yeah i think so  i could tell that he respected you sir  well thats very nice but lucky for me  my selfesteem isnt tied up in that kind of poppycock  i didnt become a doctor to impress my daddy or anyone else  i did it for me  ive seen lots of doctors get into this for the wrong reason   you know what happens to them  no  they quit and get their real estate licence  you look upset sweetheart  you shouldnt be  i think youd look super in a gold blazer  thank you  this is almost too easy  well work is great johnny  i like to believe that im selling dreams   but dad you sell office supplies  yeah i prefer to call them dreams  im gonna steal another jello  i always thought parents were like tornadoes  they blow into town and devastate everything in their path   hi  theres no food on your tray  oh  but its different for me  how you doing elliot  great talk anyway johnny  i was talking to my buddy jake this afternoon   you remember jake  no  jakes my buddy and hes leaving the country  for who knows how long so i thought i might  get out of here tomorrow and go catch up with him  id miss your thing  but i wouldnt know what i was hearing anyway   right  right  i think what surprised me the most  is that i was actually surprised  you still talking to yourself  i thought youd outgrow that by now  i probably shouldve woken him up to say goodbye  considering hed be gone before i got home  i told myself i wanted to let the old guy get some sleep  but even i didnt believe that  you keep eating that  therell be nothing left for a man to put a ring on  mom  i started therapy  do you know that amy swansons marrying drew gertson  drew is such a nice boy  drew used to hold people down and spit in their mouths  he doesnt do that anymore  mom when i was a little girl did i want to be a doctor  maybe i used a toy stethoscope on one of my dolls  oh honey youd have to ask the nanny  have you ever reached a point in your life  when you really wished you knew how you got there  are you trying to tell me youre a lesbian  yes i am  yep  thats exactly exactly what im saying mom  yo jd you want to grab a bite to eat with us tonight  after we do our presentation  yeah im not that busy  if youre not busy you have time to do this discharge summary   i meant that later im not that busy  fantastic  i told my mom you like that cuban restaurant she loves cuban food  i hate that restaurant  you said you loved it and wanted to be buried in a vat of pltanos  so you could eat your way out  see thats our problem you dont get me  no argument there  hey hey hey you missed a spot right there  well lucky for me dad  i spend my life going in a circle around this place cleaning up after the sick  tomorrow ill probably be here at the same time  you know that i hate sass so drop right down and give me 20   that could be faecal matter  make it 30  fine  what is it with parents  why is it so easy for them to make us feel bad   three  sound off like youve got a pair  dad i dont gotta put up with  youve got to at least try and pace yourself  otherwise sure as shooting youre gonna burn out  come  i heard the sad sigh i see your shoulders are slumped  and im aware that you have some problem  you want to talk to me about  you probably think itll be cathartic to get it off your chest  but believe me it wont be  what youve got to do for me is the healthy thing  keep all of your feelings bottled up inside where they so belong  my dad flaked on me again  im sorry youre not on drugs are you  what no  are you in jail have you been beaten are you malnourished  i skipped lunch but ive been snacking  you are in fact a perfectly healthy 26yearold doctor  who keeps crying about how horrible his father was  well he did some considerable emotional damage so  every one of our parents does considerable emotional damage  and from what ive heard  it just might be the best part of being a parent  if some guy ever does put a ring on your finger  and youre lucky enough to pop out a youngster im sure youll understand  but for now trust me when i tell you that i wouldnt care  if today was the first time you ever even met your daddy  because in reality  well he couldve done a much much worse job  ok  all right look at the presentation  could i do the ending i really love the end of our paper  do you think that im cut out to be a doctor  ok fine you can do the ending  i just want to say thanks folks weve been great  im serious do you think this is what i really want to do  elliot i dont know  you can tell me i can take it  no im saying i dont know because i really dont know  what the hell is going on here  why have all women gone crazy  im not crazy am i  no shh  its ok elliot youre normal youre normal   turk  hes not here  turk  i do like that cuban restaurant  i think the important thing is that we got through this together  im freaked out because your mom and i have lots in common   so  i dont know  i got this crazy idea that you only fell for me  because im just like your mom  baby  thats exactly why i fell for you  ok ill probably have a friend pick up my stuff  wait sit down  whats wrong with wanting someone  because theyre smart independent and always looking out for you  ok  yeah but if we ever get married well have to talk about this in therapy  relax i dont do this with my mama  i hope not   oh yeah mama  oh thats just wrong  oh mama  part of me thought cox was wrong  i had every reason to be angry with my father  so hows it going down there  if its ok with you we just wont talk right now  got a needle need to focus  then i stopped thinking of my dad as a father  and started thinking of him as a man  and i realised some things that deep down i probably always knew  like maybe he wasnt crashing on my couch to spend more quality time with me  but because he couldnt afford a hotel room  and maybe he wasnt going to see his buddy jake to catch up  but because jake was someone he might be able to sell something to  and he really needs a sale  maybe the truth is hes just a middleaged lonely guy  struggling to get by and it sure would be nice  if someone gave him a break once in a while  hey dad  hey there he is  i thought you had to work all day  i did but i got someone to cover for me  i wanted to make sure i caught you and let you know  how cool it was to see you   really  yeah  wow i  well listen im you know  i have to travel a lot lately so  lm sure ill be back in this region again soon  so i could swing back out and see you   thatd be great  great   great  great id be happy to see you  yeah we could do that  youve been taking advantage of the farting policy  hey pull my finger   im not gonna pull your finger  see what happens  i pooed a little  dr kelso  well if it isnt daddys little girl  i wanted to tell you what happened to me  im going to keep eating my soup  but you rest assured im holding my breath on the inside  first i came out to my mother  well then  it appears the boys in radiology owe me quite a bit of money  but this afternoon  a patient puked on me  and i smiled  do you know why i was smiling  because i really like what i do  you were right i got into this for the wrong reasons  but now that im here i cant imagine being anywhere else  i still dont like your father  oh me neither sir  oh they were all out  placement of the stent in haemodynamic results of pta are inadequate  or primary stent placement at the initial time of pta  maybe the mistake we make is thinking our parents will change  and maybe they did a betterjob than we give them credit for  maybe there amid all the crap they dumped on us  are some things worth keeping  like a passion for something you never knew you had  recent trial of 283 patients  or the ability to surround yourself with people who love you  subsequent stent placement only increases in conclusion  the difference between the strategies  is not significant at either shortterm or longterm followup  thank you very much folks weve been great  and z is for the zs that youll be getting  cos you now know heart murmurs from a to z  thank you   what are you doing here  i just figured id come check it out  you know see how youre doing  and for the record that was atrocious  i mean downright abysmal  i know but did you see a through k  i did a cool thing with a through k  i showed up at y as in why dear god why  you know this has got to be  the most pisspoor sorry excuse for a hospital  that i have ever set foot in  well dad in that case feel free not to stop by every day youre in town  goodbye son  ill see you tomorrow  yeah  parents huh  tell me about it  yeah whats that a shot at my dad  thats stepping over the line pal  i missed this  yeah
