not to accept the beingdumped thing  im gonna hang around until you forgive me  or being shaken to your very core  sometimes its just having to work in wet grundies  hey betty wilma what the hell

thursday  ask me if ill go out drinking wednesday night   you wanna go out  sorry  i cant i have a presentation  the truth is youve been complaining about work  since the second i got here dying for an excuse to blow it off  so maybe you should stop being all mad at me when really  youre just pissed because you hate your jobs  every time i turn around kelsos there  ted hes trying to break my spirit  do you have any idea what that feels like  im sorry of course you do  dr reid im afraid that nothing youve described  constitutes harassment  swing and a miss eh dr reid  the next time you decide to make a stink over nothing  you should see a lawyer who didnt need five tries  to pass the bar exam  i have stressinduced dyslexia and you know that dr oslek   why are you doing this  ill tell you why perry  weve been dancing the same dance for years now  one gets angry and walks away  the others too stubborn to go after them  before you know it you sleep with some pharmaceutical rep

me  you go home ill meet you there later  bring dinner  youre a father can you believe it  nope  i didnt get a lot of sleep thinking about what spence had said  look im sorry i was such a jerk yesterday ok  come on look at this floor you could practically eat off of it   would you  would i what  would you eat off the floor  as i bent down to eat that peppered floor turkey  unaware that the cleanser the janitor uses  is an extremely potent diuretic i realised something  the reason were doctors is because we have  an innate desire to help people  that was disgusting  you have to have that desire  because at the end of your second year  its impossible to see the light at the end of the tunnel  so it becomes about perseverance  and fortitude  and sacrifice  sorry you guys cant make the wedding  give them a big kiss for us  tell them the ferret only eats fresh vegetables  im gonna miss you guys   ill see ya later  later dude  really all you can hope for is an occasional thankyou  im so glad the medication worked  im supposed to be happy cos somebody did something right  youre welcome  nice call on the antiseizure medicine  im starting to think you may not be the worst resident that ever lived   how cool was that  shut up  you shut up youre an angry man  sorry i didnt tell you about the lts your baby thing  well probably talk about that later   i wasnt even mad at jordan  no

our asses cos we deserved it  remember you told me i wasnt the worst resident that ever lived  eight seconds ago  you have no idea how much that meant to me  i said i think you may not be the worst resident ever  but i cant be sure of stuff like that i havent done the legwork  youre always there when we need you  i think you have this fathering thing down  why am i not leaving dr reid  i dont want to miss you breaking down  and weeping in front of everyone  here it comes great big tears great big crocodile tears  if she was your daughter youd totally know how to handle it  my god youre right   youre doing fine barbie  thank you  everybody have a good one  im going home to see my son  excuse me there bobbo  right in the nose yeah  that may come up tomorrow
