                hospitals are filled with people who just came off 18hour shifts  so when a patient dies its not uncommon to take them to the morgue yourself  then grab a little shuteye in their bed

little date  because i have some busy work thats gonna take me over into the vicinity of mr hudsons room  so ill just pop my head in there and tell him that hes going to die  but if you have a moment between dinner and giving it away for free  if you could pick up the phone and call mr hudsons wife and kids  and tell them about you know the dying  oh i know sugar  this would be just the most

 soooothanks to you sean blew me off but im okay  old elliot would have gone into a tailspin but new elliots just gonna get him back  because new elliot is a fixer  like that guy over there  if his stitches lifted and his spleen ruptured  i would just go overand fix them  my spleen is going to rupture  relax youre fine  you know what i am just going to show sean that he will always come first  gosh i hate to interrupt this onegal peprally  there barbie but i give this guy two weeks  three if you are just terrific in the sack  well then its three  i mean youre wrong  you know i just uh i just got off the phone with jordan  who told me that my son rolled over for the first time  oh my god thats so great  big who cares not about jack rolling over for the first time  but definitely about your reaction to my son rolling over for the first time  point being that i missed it because i was here  you might want to get a pen out and write this down  because here comes the inside scoop the hospital comes first  always  always  forever and ever  daaaaaaaaaaaaaaand everandeverandeverandever  you gettin this  aaaand everandeverandeverandeveraneverandever  so ill pick you up tomorrow okay  okay  and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever andeverandeverandeverandever  youre not that comfortable with the manonman action are you  so im a little homophobic i mean we all got our stuff right  i bet deep down inside youre a little racist  marrying a black guy  dude how pissed are your parents honestly  so what makes you so uncomfortable is it the sex  dont get me wrong  i dont love the idea of kissing anyone with a mustache  thats why i always pretend to have a cold when carlas aunt comes to town  what really freaks me out though is the thought of being that open with another guy  any guy  i dont know what it is i mean thats just the way i been my whole life  maybemaybe its because im scared you know  dudethats a little gay  what  nurse espinosa i feel bad about what happened before  and so i went and searched through like forty bags of garbage  and i found the torn off urine label also found half a tooth  over here jumpsuit  mr thomasberg lets get you to the lab  hey studly now when you were out rooting through the dumpster  you didnt stumble across your own testicles didja  hey you know that long line of trembling peons that are so afraid of you  well im not in that line  oh youre not  no im not in anybodys line  this is a chicklet  i gotta go  im always happy when someone wins a battle  because around here you get your fair share of disappointment  i guess in the end you have to fight for things that really matter  like pride in your work  or your friendship  you know im actually starting to like journey  well youre gonna be very pleased with the next twentythree songs  you know the fact that youre even here for an endofanera celebration is enough  we dont have to like get all deep or anything  no i wanna try this man  okay um ever since carla and i set the date for the wedding i started thinking  you know those lameass couples that get engaged but they never actually get married   they just cruise along year after year without making any real kind of commitment  dude i wanted to be one of those couples man  hey puki can we get two appletinis please  and sometimes all you can do is grit your teeth and tell the truth  hey  look i was planning on coming here and telling you that youll always come first  but the truth is thats not a promise i can keep  but the one thing i _can_ guarantee you is that when its my decision  ill always choose you but if thats not enough i understand
