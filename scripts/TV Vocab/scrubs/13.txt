                you asked out a girl stuck in an mri machine  without ever seeing her face  remember no matter what she looks like  be sure to play it cool  yes  yes you are smokin hot  in your face  that night we went out on our first date  had our first dinner  rented our first movie  took our first long drive  look out  killed our first raccoon  ever since then every date weve been on has always ended the same way  no  cox wants me back at the hospital   but the page is addressed to lillian  thats me  what a drag  that was probably the wrong time to ask for a quickie  i have been coerced  by the forces of evil into conducting rounds this morning  why do you have to do rounds  because im sleepy hows that  to make this a more palatable experience for moi  i am not going to call you by your names ill be referring to you  by whatever distinguishing physical characteristic occurs to me  you chicken beak  what causes pneumonia presenting with diarrhoea   legionella  nice job  it turns out your minds just as sharp as your nose  and you dye job  what are the elements of whipples triad  its hard to describe how scary it is when you dont know an answer  i cant remember i am so sorry  what are you sorry about  dr kelso yells at us when we dont know  children  you cant let that bloated bag of hate affect you  being a doctor is as much about finding the answers as knowing them  for instance take clarabelles patient here mr yeager  we have no idea whats wrong with him  so we have run tests for everything and according to these results  everything seems to have come back negative  which doesnt necessarily mean that clarabelle is a failure  it just means that shes got to keep trying  no matter how frustrated she might get  now of course if you are lazy and incompetent  then yes that will buy you a oneway ticket out of here  doug  listen carefully kelso cant do a thing to you if you answer a question wrong  it doesnt work that way moving on not you you still have work to do  johnny notan id like you to present the next patient to me  i love you  now say it in spanish  te amo  now say it like astro  i ruv roo   you are very very cute  i know  ive been thinking about this i love you thing  its gonna make everything so much better  i mean were so in sync better conversation  better dancing  and  way better shrumpdown  yeah  im so sorry that has never happened to me before  man shes beautiful  i wish i was that piece of bacon wait a second  i am that piece of bacon  thats right  you mind not staring at me while im eating  i hate it   but im not  what am i doing right now   eating  what are you doing  staring  there now no one gets to eat it   you happy  not really  you know whats great  even when our dates get interrupted we can have a date here  lets say you wanted to watch a movie  we could go to the conference room and watch that video on stds  its funny and it makes you think  maybe it would be good if we actually had a date that   ends  how does a date with you end  it can range from a kiss at the door  to all i have for breakfast is yoghurt and im out of bowls  so youll have to eat off my stomach  tonight dinner hydes  its a date  judging from the ataxia dysarthria  ive concluded that mr yeager is suffering from kuru   kuru  kuru   kuru  yes kuru   id actually never thought of that  hell yeah  were you aware that the only documented cases of kuru  were members of a cannibalistic tribe in papua new guinea   i was not  actually doc  i was in new guinea last week   really  no   do you happen to know what a zebra is  he just mocked me  its a diagnosis of an obscure disease  when its more likely to be a common illness with uncommon symptoms  in other words if you hear hoof beats  you just go ahead and think horsies not zebras  mmkay mr silly bear   whats wrong  its personal  why wont you ever open up to me i came to you  when i thought i had a broken tailbone and it was just a really bad pimple  its a sex thing ok  like a gender issue or like intercourse because im booksmart on both  carla use me   last night when i was with carla  dude i cant talk  i gotta figure this mr yeager thing out  cool  my horse didnt finish the race  im at the filling station but my credit cards declined   im on the jet ski  i got it   good i had no idea what to say  no mr yeager  where you go who am i going to talk to about sex  lets get our talk on  player to player  afternoon rounds that day began like any other  this patient is hypoglycaemic what are the signs of an insulinoma dr reid  elevated cpeptide levels  score but before you do your crazy endzone dance  tell me the spinal fluid findings in guillaumebarr syndrome   xanthochromia  wrong  and then it happened suddenly dr kelso didnt seem as frightening  dr reid what do you have to say for yourself  win some lose some  in fact nothing he did seemed to scare us  not any more  not even the most horrible thing he could think of  all right welcome to the icu no really sit down  for women that dont know how to cook i put the yellow pages in there  what do you want mexican italian japanese american cuisine  its a cook im flatlinin beep  save him  tip your

me you cried  or ill ban you from the mens room again  i was so excited what we were doing here i forgot about our date  you didnt forget you kept looking at your watch i saw you  i assumed that you were afraid of missing judging amy  it never occurred to me you were choosing work  over being with that sweet little biscuit  that means a lot coming from you  mr rightherewithme twohoursafterhisshift  andlastmondaynighttoo guy   what  you heard me  newbie whatre you saying  that you want to be like me  do you understand that i just barely want to be like me  i cant even pretend i can give you tips on intercourse  i got one for you stop calling it that  my therapist thinks my trouble in bed stems from a fear of intimacy  but i think its because any type of repetitive motion makes me nauseous  and since i was a kid ive had nightmares about being crushed  that poor shrink  the one thing i do know is that ive sabotaged a lot of relationships  by never talking things out with the guy that im seeing   thanks  sure  so youve really never had  no   not even by yourself  gross  is it easy  whens your next laundry night  ted  i need you to take care of some lawyer crap for me  itd be great if you would go to traffic court for me and make this go away  i dont think so  excuse me  no bob i have my own things i need to take care of  of course  walk off bitch  how is it exactly that you just said that  and your pants are still dry  dont you understand  what you did when you spoke to those interns  you took away the fear  you are a wonderful person  and i love you  i have to ask alex for another chance i have to  ok shes with a hot guy stay calm shes gonna be psyched to see you  jd hey  or not  i dont prioritise you over my job but id like to  i wanted to be a doctor for so long  i sort of forgot how to want anything else  and now i meet you and  ill do anything in the world if you give me a second chance  im sorry  ill leave you guys alone  ok rowdy  fetch  hey sweetie   we have to talk  no time for talk  we have a problem we need to take care of  why are you wearing a nosebreathing thingy  baby bear with me i got big ideas  ive been having all these thoughts going through my head  and im afraid if i tell you id scare you away  thats the last thing that i wanna take that damn thing off  oh god  baby theres nothing that could scare me away  since we said i love you ive been feeling all this pressure  and wondering about the future our future  are we gonna get married are we gonna have kids  if so when will i get my figure back  where are we gonna live will my mother live with us how big a house  how many bathrooms what if she walks in on you  while youre in the bathroom you fall and i cant afford the funeral costs  thats a little scary  i guess i just need to know you think about that stuff too  carla  no i dont   but i love it that you do  yeah  thats what makes this relationship work  were so different i keep us in the present  you look out for whats up ahead  besides there is no way in hell  your mothers ever going to live with us  if she ever walks in on me while im in the bathroom  shes getting a trip to florida   no shes not  im tell  ladies and germs if you get this shorthand down  it has a way of making your day go quicker  ctd being circling the drain your patient is on the way out  sob shortness of breath and wnl within normal limits  elvis feel free to write this down  any time before you leave the building   you paged me  i didnt page you  and thats when dr cox started poking the old bear with a stick  im sick of the grill em and drill em  what do you say we shake things up  you kids ask me the questions and ill just give you the answers  dr cox could i talk to you  sure bob but you have to raise your hand like all the other children   i just think its inappropriate  bobo  now youve got five good ones right there  what do you say you put em up in the air like you just dont care  get over here right now  maybe he felt sorry for kelso and didnt wanna take the one thing he had  maybe he just hated rounds  get the hell outta my icu  but if you didnt know dr cox like i did  you wouldve believed his performance too  i guess the key to a lot of things is balance  whether its balance of power  dr simotas stop smiling  i hate smiling  balance in love  or sometimes  just balance  for some of us it seems too far out of reach  too difficult to achieve  but the important thing is just to never stop trying  especially if you like girls named alex  and chicken salad
