on four since med school  damn it  we shouldnt feel weird about this   things like this happen all the time  all the time   its not a big deal  its not a big deal  stop repeating what i say in that weird tone   no more repeating  what happened last night was  a wonderful mistake  and its probably best if we just go back to the way things were  i totally agree  im gonna see you tomorrow  tomorrow  elliots amazing and youre crazy about her  if you let her leave im gonna do this all day  i get knocked down but i get up again youre never gonna keep me down  i get knocked down  wait elliot  i just

are really good at having sex we should take this show on the road  my mom would sit in the front row  and tell me id look prettier if i smiled more  you dont really smile you just make this face  you looked surprised that you were actually having sex  i was i mean four times  give it up   i think i already did  you did  how weird was that this morning  have you ever been more uncomfortable in your entire life  you look hot in that dress  what movie are we watching  its basic instinct grandma  yeah once but all this sex  it just soothes my soul  and i really like your nose  how did that last time even start  i just know i went to the door  and when i came back you said i looked sexy holding a pizza  you did  for safety reasons i should go  youre not going anywhere  you gotta help me eat this pizza  good  see now you even look sexy holding that slice   i do dont i  you do  i was not you were  sometimes i like a little sugar in my coffee  i just think its best if we keep this between us for now  its hard enough without everybody talking  but itll help people like those two for instance  theyve been dancing around each other for months now  im not afraid to show people here how i feel about you  you just want the guys to know youre getting some  not just the guys  good morning dr cox  we are shortstaffed today  because kelso has volunteered all of you scut monkeys  for some psychologists research project  which means you wont be helping patients  instead youll be blabbering about your feelings  and what its like working in the hospital  and how that affects your personal lives and  and there he is now big bobo himself  all nurses and interns lets gather round  and dance for the puppet master  dance  its not just the nurses and interns  dont be that guy bob  i guess i became a doctor because  ever since i was a little boy i just wanted to help people  i dont tell this story very often  but i remember when i was seven years old  i found a bird that had fallen out of its nest  so i picked him up and i brought him home  and i made him a house out of an empty shoebox and  my god  i became a doctor for the same four reasons everybody does  chicks money power and chicks  but since hmos have made it virtually impossible  to make any real money which affects the number of chicks  who come sniffing around and dont ask what tree theyre barking up  cos theyre sure not pissing on mine and as far as power goes well  here i am during my free time letting some 13yearold  psychology fellow ask me questions about my personal life  so heres the inside scoop  why dont you go ahead and tell me all about power  check her out   dude hffa  excuse me  hffa hot from far away but up close shes nasty  that is so messed up  i am sorry i made an insensitive statement about an ugly person  im taking one of those moments  where i weigh your good qualities against your bad ones  and decide if youre actually worth the trouble  you made it that was close   thank you  youre welcome  elliots looking for a surgical consult   do you know where she is  why should i know  i know where the todd would like elliot to be in his pants  clever  shes not going out with anyone you should ask her out  elliot and the todd thats a terrible couple   worse than joanie and chachi  joanie loves chachi  the todd is asking elliot out   i think shed be lucky to ride my  please  motorcycle  gotcha  god bless him  when i was seven the only things that i loved  were my colecovision and sandy lowe  sandy was as fine as a 7yearold could be  she had the body of a 9yearold  i joined the tball team because she was on it  i didnt care that much about sports  but during the first game i got all caught up  and fell in love with competing  and so through high school and college  i pretty much played everything because i needed to compete  it was my drug  thats why i became a surgeon every day you get to step up to the table  and go oneonone against whats wrong with the patient  and if youre really good at it  you win most of the time  i ran into sandy lowe last christmas  and she didnt look so good  and that was kind of awkward cos  well i look like this  are you following me  no you wanna go out some time  with you  me and a bottle of jagermeister  no todd i dont but i dont want you to think  its because im a lesbian or anything  i find you so creepy i think you should walk around with a bell around your neck  all i heard was lesbian  let me talk to her for you  why did he ask me out  i dont know because youre cute and youre fun  and i told him to plus theres rumours going around that youre a lesbian  you told me not to tell anyone about us so maybe i just wanna make a point  and now im gonna kiss you  its cool jds in the closet talking to a girl for me  white boys  you too  when i was little my mom used to have what she called episodes  episodes is a flattering term for this thing where shed sweat a lot and  lets just say her stomach talked  anyway this one time we were at the supermarket  and she actually passed out  and out of nowhere this fancylooking guy comes forward  and tells everyone to step aside and give my mother some air  and everyone did  you have to understand in my family nobody listens to a word anyone else says  even screaming at the top of our lungs nothing  so when this man said step aside and everyone did  i asked my aunt who is this guy  and she said he was a doctor  and i thought  i want to be a doctor too  but when i lost my first tooth and nobody left 180000  under my pillow i decided to become a nurse  we do all the real stuff anyway   you ok  yeah  i may eventually need a vagina transplant  go go  we dont have much time  you know what  after i have sex five times with somebody i like to have the relationship talk  i know it seems rushed but five times  usually takes me anywhere between six months and seven years  lets do it lets have the talk   you my boyfriend  yep you my girlfriend   yep  cool  good to talk things through  i love that little laugh  from now on that is your laugh  what  ive seen you naked so everything youre doing im watching you do it naked  so if i go like this  i just i saw all of that  dont be shy come here baby   the echo report on the aorta  bravo just a big bravo  heaven help me i love newbie theatre  honest i do its the way you both play your parts  with such wonderful commitment that almost had me believing  that you arent having whiny neurotic pale sex with each other  what are you talking about  the whole floor knows we do watch this  laverne did you know  was it supposed to be a secret  and carla  please i knew before they did  so there it is  and if you go ahead and listen very carefully  youll hear the familiar sound of no one caring  i like that guy  when the kelsonoviches settled in monroeville pa  there were two steel mills three bars  and not a doctor in sight  then my old man set up a shingle  and started delivering babies  and stitching up threefingered steel men by the wagonload  everybody loved him  when they couldnt come up with the cash  he would gladly accept a handmade sweater  or a bushel of turnips  jackass  now i get to do this in public  this is a hospital all right people here are already sick  you guys do it all the time   tell me we dont look like that  we dont look like that  you guys are just jealous  cos youre not the hot couple in town any more  jealous my chocolate butt  im telling you we are so damn hot  last night when i was home waiting for turk  i put on this tiny negligee it was so small i took it off my latin barbie  when i got home you were asleep drooling like a sheepdog  you dont have to tell em that  while you guys were sleeping  we were up in the kitchen fryin up some love  relationships well sigmund  relationships are so fragile  it just takes one thing one  tiny little offence and it can snowball on you  and if that snowball starts to pick up speed god forbid  you better tuck and go  why did you do that how could you think  thats appropriate conversation for work   we didnt have sex  no   especially not on the stove what  that is not funny  sorry  we didnt  thats great thanks  thanks a lot jd really mature  come on  elliot  i am so full   give me another slice  really  yeah big one  i cannot have any more until i work off the last two slices  so what do you say fat gassy bloaty sex  ok   im gonna puke  i dont care  mr lewis  were gonna need another stool sample  not for medical reasons my robot needs food  that laugh  but its your laugh i gave it to you  i love it so much i cant stop using it  its not as charming if youre mad  you only laugh at your own jokes you never laugh at anything i do  thats not true  colonoscopy dr cox im open  hit me  there was nothing funny about that  maybe you just dont know funny let me help you out  silly hats are funny alf very funny  anyone in a chicken suit oversized phones are funny   jd  hold on  hello  shes right here  its for you  you know what youre not as funny as you think you are  and bam  the shines off the apple  thats when you find out that that pretty girl you married  isnt a pretty girl at all no shes a maneater  and im not talking about the whoa whoa here she comes kind of maneater  im talking about the kind that uses your dignity as a dishtowel  to wipe up any shreds of manhood that might be stuck inside the sink  i may have tormented her from time to time  but thats what i thought marriage was all about  so much so that by the end of that relationship  i honestly dont know who i hated more her or me  i used to sit around and wonder  why our friends werent trying to destroy each other like we were  and here it turns out the answers pretty simple  they werent unhappy  we were  i suck at this  sorry  you look great bent over  i rolled that damn thing exactly the way the video i bought told me to  probably just a bad ball  you dont have to patronise me tell me that i suck  its hard to be honest when youre so neurotic  you dont even trust the computer to keep your score   im neurotic  im sorry   is it always this hard  bowlings a tricky sport   no i meant  i know  its difficult for everybody   my baby got a strike  i got a strike   my baby did it  i got a strike  knock em down my baby know how to knock em down   turk im dizzy  sorry  im sorry about him  my turn  want me to pick you up  enid has always understood  how much my career meant to me  she knows im an important man in my field  and it helps her get on all those boards of things her friends are on  you know like bringing art  to the underprivileged kids in the community blah blah blah  when i first met her she wanted to be a psychiatrist  but we both decided  that that wasnt a fitting profession for a family woman  no offence sweetheart  i know shes grateful  she likes to joke that  i choked the last breath of life out of her long ago  now shes just a shell of a woman  i think thats so cute i call her shelly  you know when i call her that  sometimes she laughs so hard  she cries a little  you shouldve gotten a cardiology fellow  to give mrs zuckerman a transvenous pacemaker one hour ago  sir i was waiting to see  you were waiting im sorry thats  thats my mistake  im gonna wait with ya  dr cox  gotta give it time because you see  when youre waiting for someone to get better all by themselves  the whole thing becomes about time  i was waiting to see if she would tolerate her low heart rate  which is what the textbooks tell us to do am i right jd   is she right jd  technically yes  but its really a judgment call  and if she really was that bradycardic  i probably wouldve called the fellow  but i thats me i  always side with the hoochie newbie  its a rookie mistake  you hate to see it   tell you about my girlfriend  tell you about my boyfriend  ok  i can be myself around carla  turk makes me feel completely safe  and totally independent at the same time  and its all the same whether im with her or with my boys  i can say whatevers on my mind  and even if he doesnt like it  even if he doesnt understand it he respects it  dont get me wrong im not gonna give my boys a back rub  sure if a brothers got an itch ill scratch it but  he seems to like who i am  shes a cool lady   i love her  i love him  i shouldve stood up for you with dr cox  you shouldve  i dont want him to think its about our relationship  i know that you want dr cox to respect you  but you should want me to respect you too  if i didnt respect you i wouldnt be having sex with you   thats not true i would be  if you cant talk for real forget it  a perfect dismount off her high horse  if you dont like something say it why hide behind stupid jokes  why is it impossible for you to let anything go  i let stuff go like when you wouldnt stand up for me with dr cox  or when you told everyone were having sex   when are you letting that go  you wanna know why i wont let that go  you wouldnt stand up for me  because youre terrified that someone wont like you  and thats a bad thing  why dont we get all my friends together in a room and well fight your friend  im getting so tired of this  elliot this is me  and theres a lot of people here who like me for who i am   i thought you were one of em  i thought i was too  relationships dont work the way they do in the movies  will they wont they they finally do and theyre happy for ever  nine out of ten end because they werent right for each other to begin with  and half of the ones that get married get divorced anyway  and through all this i have not become a cynic  i do happen to believe that love is mainly about  pushing chocolatecovered candies and you know in some cultures a chicken  you can call me a sucker i dont care  because i do believe in it  bottom line is couples that are right for each other  wade through the same crap as everybody else  but the big difference is they dont let it take em down  one of those two people will fight for that relationship  every time if its right and theyre real lucky  one of em will say something  things that wouldnt have bothered you a week ago in a friendship  become so incredibly important when sex is involved  i just think itd be easier  if you werent friends with your girlfriend  at all  ive always been sure about everything sure that i wanted to be a doctor  and i was sure that i was gonna be married by the time i was 25  but relationships  i always heard that when they were right they were easy  that even when things got hard  that they were easy  i dont get that at all  how is that possible  am i in a relationship now  no im not in one now  no  i cant believe todays over   i cant believe i ate half a pizza  please you had two pieces  if you tell anyone anything about today please leave that part out  i will cos im a gentleman  do you think this is gonna work out  yeah i think its gonna be great  i believe you  i believe me too
