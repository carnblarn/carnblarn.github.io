anybody want to go to a not you   doctors  doctor  i love that  dr douglas i got the results back from your fasting lipids  your llds very elevated so you may want to start a  hmgcoa reductase inhibitor   you knew the answer  shut up   whats your problem  this doesnt come easy for me  i study every night and you know what else i do to remember all this crap  i tape record myself saying it and i listen to myself over and over  do you have any idea how annoying it is to hear myself go on and on and on  and on  no  come on i have problems too i traded my meningitis patient  traded him like a baseball card  wanna know why i was afraid of him  im a doctor whos afraid of sick people wanna take a picture with me  its a weird feeling when you realise youve lost the respect  of four people all at once  but its nothing compared to losing respect for yourself  push it out two more  come on kid bitchin reps   a dumbass says what  what  i said a dumbass says what  what   youre down here again  20  hey baby   you likes  i miss you  maybe tonight we can you know rent a movie and then not watch it  we just got started down here  no problem  just dont wake me up if you get home too late ok  props for the commitment   im out  and there it is  i knew your ass would quit   i got a life  cry me a river  my dance card is fullup too  how many nights a week are you in here   a few  hes being modest  hes down here polishing his guns every night  that doesnt mean i dont have a life  a couple times we went out for a beer after   you two have fun  dr cox   can i get a spot  im here for you  oh god  i gotta meet someone  big kahuna little help  i just came by to apologise   for what  im not sure  but i am really sorry  i should be the one apologising i got so buried in work  and then i just took it all out on you  im big on forgiving people who look like theyre about to kiss me  and the work never ends  i have to be ready for rounds take care of my patients  i have scut work and research papers due  and if my internship does not go well this year  im not getting a good residency next year  and without the residency there goes my fellowship  and that doesnt leave a lot of time for us  so i think that maybe we should make this more casual  but come on i know i could never be casual with you  wed just end up here again right  what are you saying  i dont know  then why are you saying it  my god  i think im saying that i cant make this work right now  ive got an idea lets go back to where you said that you should be apologising  then well kiss again cos that was good  sean you dont understand how hard it was for me just to get to this point  if i dont do my best im going to hate myself for ever  whats with being the best  what is so bad about being adequate thats what i do  no you dont  i know  i have to go back in  im just gonna stand here and wait with these flowers  cos in two minutes youll realise what a big mistake youre making  i hope so   i want my meningitis patient back  no  do you know any women who hate themselves enough to date me   whyd you let me switch patients  you asked me to   and because of your puppydog eyes  you knew i was scared  why didnt you tell me to deal with it  i dont know what it was about that day  maybe i hadnt had enough sleep maybe my mind was on other things  maybe i didnt have enough fibre and failed to do my morning business  i dont know what it was but the bottom line is  i didnt feel like spelling it out for you  you want your little speech and thats fine because here it is  youre a doctor you might get sick  get over it  thank you now can i have my patient back  no because aside from his weird judy blume obsession  i like him you will be delousing mr schaffer  guys like flypaper  fantastic  and belinda  do you know what else is real contagious  a big ol smile  when you start med school  they warn you that youre gonna have to make sacrifices  that means different things to different people  like giving up something you want now  for something youve wanted your whole life  or spending less time on yourself  so you can spend more time with someone you love  at some point you might even have to give up your own sense of safety  after a while it doesnt feel like youre giving up anything   hey doc  you know what  lets talk superfudge
