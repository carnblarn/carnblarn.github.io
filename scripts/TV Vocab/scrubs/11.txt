already in the camera  banana hammock  so in other words there is no permanent historical record  of the birth of my friends baby  well i think that the baby itself  would serve as proof that it was you know  born  you dont understand what youve done  my exwife is gonna hold this over my head for so long  that i doubt ill ever see the sun again  and i liked the sun newbie it made me hopeful  well i was there  i could certainly jot down some of my  feelings and impressions  if he was really mad at me he would have stayed and yelled at me  dont kid yourself i couldnt be any madder at you  no do not do that again thats a bad newbie  i can go home now maybe its because christmas is a hard time  or because too many families get together  but christmas eve its one of the worst nights of the year to be on call  i cant believe im wearing a suit at 630 in the morning  if you ruin this for turk ill hurt you  noted  you better hurry up mass starts in 15 minutes   im not going  great can i go back

ever happen to either one of them  i never really thought of faith as important  but without his i dont know turk kinda seems like hes fading away  i could use a little faith i have to tell them i didnt tape a thing  you made some interesting choices with the camera orson   you didnt want any faces  excuse me  i switched the tapes just go with it  here it comes i see the head   what a gorgeous head of hair  thats funny  he was bald when he was in here a few minutes ago   yeah well  we shaved the baby   you shaved the baby  shaved it  standard procedure what with the recent outbreak of prenatal lice  yep definitely  shave and haircut  two bits  really  im not buying it  you two are gonna go by the nursery and see baby charlie   absolutely  yes  charlie and his new haircut   have we

your little lost ducklings  its important you understand something im not interested in babies  i dont melt when i see them  i dont have a yearning to make them my lifes work  im a doctor interested in my patients male or female  right now one of them needs help  god do i know women  i dont get it why are we on the roof  i wanted to show you that no matter how ugly things can get down there  theres still a lot of beauty up here  is that gum or pigeon crap on my sneaker  come on look around  theres nobody here no one can see us  we could do whatever we wanted  like what  how are you not

out his name  is this a joke to you  no im just trying to help you feel better   you dont know how i feel  well then tell me  i feel abandoned  all my life ive believed that god listens to our prayers  and that he cares for us and that he watches over us  last night so many people needed to be watched over  how am i supposed to believe in someone thats gonna let innocent people suffer  answer me please  i cant  did you see baby charlie yet  oh yeah i was just planning on doing that never  youre such a special friend  gosh marjorie arent you sassy today  did santa finally bring you that y

moron  dont answer that question its a trick thats a trick  prenatal lice  you do realise that would be lice in the womb  ive seen them theyre real and gross  maybe dr cox had pushed me too far whatever it was i told on him  plus he didnt even go see baby charlie yet  and then something amazing happened they connected  and all the hatred they had for each other  was suddenly focused on me  excuse me sally sensitive i dont remember asking you anything  your moms aware shell have to stop breastfeeding  good jordan good now work the body under the ribs  im not gonna see that baby either are you gonna tattle on me are you   im frightened  do you have a second   god yes  run away  i spoke to a 911 operator who got a call from a girl in labour  but they lost the signal i dont know what to do  one of the worst things about this place  is how often you feel like theres no one to turn to  youll be ok  babies are amazing  especially the way they bring people together  so baby charlie is the bald one  yeah he wouldnt be smiling so much if he knew how ugly his parents were   youre a sexy bitch  thanks  i really think its impossible to be unaffected  what up little dawg  a baby can stir something deep down inside you you didnt know was there  look at the baby  they help you find something you thought youd lost  how did you know she was here  i dont know i just knew  i guess turk was right after all  miracles do happen  i think you just have to be willing to look for them  merry christmas guys  god bless us every one  dude you could not be a bigger dork  youre so lame  that was so cheesy  really cos i felt like it was right  wait up
