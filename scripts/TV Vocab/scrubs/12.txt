a chance to throw a perfect game my god barbie  how do you put your bra and panties on in the morning  all by yourself its remarkable   see cos hes the pitcher  yeah i get it now  a chance to be part of a perfect game  is a onceinalifetime opportunity it just never happens  which is why i dont mind dr cox paging me  for the 13th time this last hour  icu is where the most critical cases get turfed
