                 take him down  hes got you sheldon   look at this move  hes completely schooling you  hey guys some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something  its called tresling  it combines the physical strength of arm wrestling  with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport  thats terrific but they wanted me to ask you  to cut it the hell out  great come here guys come on  happy birthday to you  we might as well stop its a stalemate youre beating me in tetris  but youve got the upper body strength of a keebler elf  keebler elf ive got your keebler elf right here  okay its a stalemate  so leonard will we be seeing you on saturday   for your free birthday cheesecake  he cant eat cheesecake   hes lactose intolerant  he can have carrot cake   what about the cream cheese frosting  he can scrape it off  forget about the cake how do you know my birthdays saturday  i did your horoscope remember i was gonna do everybodys  until sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants  for the record that psychotic rant was a concise summation  of the research of bertram forer who in 1948 proved conclusively  through meticulously designed experiments  that astrology is nothing but pseudoscientific hokum  blah blah blah typical taurus  are we gonna see you saturday   i dont think so  why not   i dont celebrate my birthday  shut up yeah you do  its no big deal its just the way i was raised  my parents focused on celebrating achievements  and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them  thats so silly  its actually based on very sound theories   his mother published a paper on it  what was it called  i hate my son and thats why he cant have cake  it was obviously effective  leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist  perhaps if shed also denied him christmas  hed be a little better at it   thank you  youre welcome  well i love birthdays  waking up to moms special french toast breakfast  wearing the birthday king crown  playing laser tag with all my friends  yeah see thats what kids should have  actually that was last year  so you really never had a birthday party  no but it was okay when i was little id think  maybe my parents would change their mind and surprise me with a party  like this one birthday i came home from my cello lesson  and i saw a lot of strange cars parked out front  when i got to the door i could hear people whispering  and i could smell german chocolate cake which is my favorite  and  it turns out my grandfather had died  oh my god thats terrible  well it was kind of like a birthday party  i got to see all my cousins and there was cake so  its the saddest thing ive ever heard  you think  go ahead tell her about your senior prom  episode 116 the peanut reaction   make sure they remember no peanuts  howard every thai restaurant in town knows you cant eat peanuts  when they see me coming they go ah nopeanut boy   hello penny leonard just left  i know i want to talk to you  what would we talk about  we have no overlapping areas of interest im aware of  as you know i dont care for chitchat   can you just let me in  all right  but i dont see this as a promising endeavor  heres the deal were gonna throw leonard a kickass surprise party   for his birthday on saturday  i hardly think so  leonard made it very clear he doesnt want a party  did someone say party  he just doesnt know he wants one cause hes never had one  i suppose thats possible but for the record  ive never had a threesome and yet i still know i want one  howard heres the difference the possibility exists  that leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over  fine if i do have a threesome you cant be part of it  im just kidding yes you can  can you bring a friend  i think a birthday partys a terrible idea  i envy leonard for growing up without that anguish  anguish  year after year i had to endure  wearing comical hats while being forced  into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles  not to mention being blindfolded  and spun toward a grotesque tailless donkey  as the other children mocked my disorientation  okay sweetie i understand  you have scars that no nonprofessional can heal  but nevertheless were going to throw leonard a birthday party  have i pointed out that im extremely uncomfortable with dancing  loud music and most other forms of alcoholinduced frivolity   nevertheless  in addition i  heres the deal  you either help me throw a birthday party or i will go into your bedroom  and unbag all of your most valuable mintcondition comic books  and on one of them you wont know which  ill draw a tiny happy face in ink  you cant do that if you make a mark in a mint comic its no longer mint  do you understand the concept of blackmail  well of course i  i have an idea lets throw leonard a kickass birthday party  thats not the secret knock  this is the secret knock  what difference does it make  the whole point of a secret knock is to establish a nonverbal signal  to verify the identity of ones coconspirators   is that raj and howard  possibly but unverified  will you just let us in  luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor   so whatd you get the birthday boy  well raj got him an awesome  limited edition dark knight sculpture based on alex rosss definitive batman  and i got him this amazing autographed copy  of the feynman lectures on physics  nice  i got him a sweater  okay well he might like that ive seen him get chilly   sheldon i didnt see your present  thats because i didnt bring one   why not  dont ask  the entire institution of giftgiving makes no sense   too late  lets say i go out  and i spend 50 on you  its a laborious activity because i have to imagine what you need  whereas you know what you need  now i could simplify things just give you the 50 directly  and then you could give me 50  on my birthday and so on until one of us dies  leaving the other one old and 50 richer  and i ask you is it worth it  told you not to ask  sheldon youre his friend friends give each other presents  i accept your premise i reject your conclusion  try telling him its a nonoptional social convention   what  just do it  its a nonoptional social convention  oh fair enough  he came with a manual  question how am i going to get leonard a present before the party  i dont drive and the only things available within walking distance  are a thai restaurant and a gas station  i suppose i could wrap up an order of mee krob  and a couple of lottery scratchers  okay lets do this  i will drive sheldon to get a present howard you need to get rid of leonard   for about 2 hours  no problem  and then raj you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up  what if guests show up  entertain them  what if theyre women  stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable   hows it goin  fine  so listen the nuart is showing the revised  definitive cut of blade runner  seen it  no youve seen the 25th anniversary final cut  this one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage  they say it completely changes the tone of the film  pass  come on afterwards theres a q  a with harrison fords body double  look im in the halo battle of my life here  theres this kid in copenhagen he has no immune system  so all he does is sit in his bubble and play halo 24seven   cant you play him some other time  not if you believe his doctors  oh my god do you smell gas   no  yeah no  they have dvds over there  yes but they have dvd burners over here  leonard needs a dvd burner  a gift shouldnt be something someone needs it should be something fun  something they wouldnt buy for themself  you mean like a sweater  its a fun sweater  its got a bold geometric print  is it the geometry that makes it fun  the point is one of the ways we show we care about people  is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them  okay i see so not a dvd burner  exactly  something he wouldnt buy for himself something fun  something like an 80211n wireless router  here you go copenhagen boy  how about a taste of hans christian hand grenade  that could not feel good  come on come oh you clever  come on  take that   whats the matter  this granola bar has peanuts in it   oh my god why did you eat it  i dont know it was just there  if i had a gun there would you have shot yourself  dont yell at me ive got to go to the emergency room   now  no after my tongue has swollen  to the size of a brisket  all right just let me get my keys  oh god oh god oh god  the laundry is out of the hamper  okay

to let him experience the same childhood trauma i did  i know im gonna regret this but what trauma  on my 12th birthday  i really wanted a titanium centrifuge  so you know i could separate radioactive isotopes  of course  instead of a titanium centrifuge my parents bought me  this is hard  they got me  a motorized dirt bike  what 12yearold boy wants a motorized dirt bike  all of them   really  yeah
