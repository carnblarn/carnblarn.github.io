                knight to queens bishopfive  very nice whats leonard going to do  give up the pawn or give up the position  lets find out  ready  ready  go  damn it i slipped  too bad you know the rules of secret agent laser obstacle chess  leonard died again sheldon youre up  despite my deep love of chess lasers and aerosol disinfectant  i must forfeit   why  because its almost 1100  so  penny has a dont knock on my door before 1100  or i punch you in the throat rule  you know whatd be a great idea  we get some girls over here and play laser optical strip chess  believe me any girl who would be willing to play that  you dont want to see naked  you underestimate me  hey sheldon   its 1100 am  i know youre safe  this package came while you were at work  great my rhinestones thank you   excuse me  what  you have to sign this   what is it  when i signed for the package  i was deputized by the united parcel service  and entrusted with its final delivery i now need you to acknowledge  receipt of the package so that im fully indemnified and no longer liable  its just a box of rhinestones  the contents are irrelevant a legal bailment has been created  does that mean nothing to you  it means nothing to anybody   let me show you what im doing  bailment describes a relationship  in common law where a physical possession of personal property  or chattels is transferred from one person the bailor  to another person the bailee  look look i started a business  obviously not a cleaning business  no im making flower barrettes see  i call them penny blossoms  i made one for myself then all the girls at work wanted one  i showed some to this lady who runs a shop in old town  she sells cards and homemade jewelry she said she wanted to sell them  i said okay and in one week i made a 156  good for you sign here  dont you get it if this takes off i wont have to be a waitress anymore  but then who will bring me my cheeseburger on tuesday nights   another waitress  whats her name  i dont know  and youre going to let her handle my food  nancy her name is nancy  i think youre just making that up  im sorry about your hamburger  i just dont want to be a waitress for the rest of my life  cheeseburger i get a cheeseburger   fine cheeseburger  maybe id be better off with nancy  so what do you think i mean this could be a business right  how many of these can you make a day  about 20  and how much profit do you make per penny blossom  like 50 cents im not sure  of course youre not all right  ten dollars a day times five days a week  times 52 weeks a year is 2600   thats all  before taxes  i dont have to pay taxes on this stuff  i believe the internal revenue service would strongly disagree  but if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques  and you optimized your manufacturing process  you might be able to make this a viable business  and you know about that stuff  im a physicist i have a working knowledge  of the entire universe and everything it contains  whos radiohead  i have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe   good luck  sheldon hold on  could you maybe show me how to make more money with this  of course i could  wait  will you  just to be clear here  youre asking for my assistance  and you understand that will involve me telling you what to do  i understand  and youre not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while im doing so  good  lets begin with the premise  that everything youve done up to this point is wrong   oh imagine that  sarcasm goodbye  no sorry wait please come back   the fw team   there done  all right    pretty good right  thats 49 penny blossoms per hour  based on your cost of materials and your wholesale selling price  youll effectively be paying yourself 519 a day  a day  there are children in a sneaker factory in indonesia who outearn you  that just cant be right   youre questioning my math  no sorry   want me to show my work  god no  please tell me what to do about it  all right are you familiar with the development  that resulted from honor blancs  the assembly line of course  if im not allowed to be snide youre not allowed to be condescending  that wasnt a part of our original agreement and i dont agree to it now  fine  how are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment  youre thinking of the moving assembly line  an understandable but not excusable mistake  the moving assembly line that was introduced by henry ford in 1908  that innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture  by enabling a lowunit cost for manufactured goods  i guess that isnt one of the topics discussed on your radiohead  lets go were going to miss the coming attractions  whats the matter  i think i bruised a testicle capturing that last pawn  please pay attention and listen to me  give me some time to blow the man down  im a deepwater sailor just come from hong kong  to me way hey blow the man down  if you give me some whiskey ill sing you a song  give me some time to blow the man down  hello  hello  come quickly lay aft to the break of the poop  to me way hey blow the man down  or ill help you along with the toe of my boot  give me some time to blow the man down  whats going on  i assume youre referring to the sea shanty  its a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity  its crazy but it totally works  we made this penny blossom in under three minutes  terrific but that kind of raises more questions than it answers  pennys making hair accessories  im helping her optimize her manufacturing process  breaks over  pay attention to orders now you one and all  hold on what are you using as a bonding agent   hot glue  youre kidding  any of the cyanoacrylates would do a better job  the flowers too porous  what if we infused the bottom layer  with siliconertv to provide a better mounting surface  intriguing  what are your marketing and distribution channels  there are the waitresses at my work and this cute little shop in old town  virtually nonexistent  im thinking that we set her up with a hosted ecommerce system to start  why not eliminate the middle man  we could install a small server farm with a static ip in her bedroom  with an industrial cooling system  of course but before we set up marketing and distribution  we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process  to start with she has a terrible problem  with moistureinduced glitter clump  yeah its a bitch  ive seen this before   where  its a common stripper problem  they dance they sweat they clump  are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulfate  actually im thinking about this one stripper named vega  but sure calcium sulfate could work  lets think out of the box for a moment  how about a molecular sieve  ive got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen  we could liberate some microporous charcoal from the chem lab  great  raj why dont you and howard go get the charcoal  leonard why dont you start working on some preliminary web site designs  ill make some space  in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process  whats wrong with my apartment  its not my apartment  wait what am i going to do  its your business do whatever you want  okay cool  im going to take a nap  im still tweaking things a little bit  but this will give you the general idea of the web site  so what do you guys think  pretty much any way i say that is going to hurt his feelings   okay whats wrong with it  whats wrong with it  not you i wasnt asking you  well its a little juvenile  it kind of looks like the myspace page of a 13yearold girl  no it doesnt  please dateline could use it to attract predators  this is your enterprise so its ultimately your decision  but based on the quality of his work  id strongly recommend that we let leonard go  you want to fire me  what i want is irrelevant this is pennys decision  excuse me but if i did such a bad job then why do we already have orders  we do  look  mrs fiona fondell from huntsville alabama has ordered two  no kidding two  look at the comments  thank you penny blossoms  these will be perfect to cover my bald spot  that is so sweet  camouflaging bald spots  thats primarily a male concern  perhaps we could expand our market  how are flower barrettes going to appeal to men  we add bluetooth  brilliant men love bluetooth  wait a minute you want to make a hair barrette with bluetooth  everything is better with bluetooth  holy crap someone just ordered a thousand penny blossoms  get out  who needs a thousand sparkly flower barrettes  with rhinestones  the fifth annual east rutherford new jersey  gay lesbian bisexual and transgender alliance luau  another market to expand into balding gay men  and ill bet lesbians love bluetooth  we should get to work  wait why does it say oneday rush  since when do we offer a oneday rush  amazon offers oneday rush  yeah but they dont have to glue the books together  how the hell are we going to make a thousand penny blossoms in one day  dont yell at me im not manufacturing im just web design  im gonna have to call them and cancel the order  excuse me  but was this not your goal  financial independence  through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation  my brilliance and innovation of course but still  i just dont see how we can pull this off  that right there that equivocation and selfdoubt  that is not the american spirit  did davy crockett quit at the alamo did jim bowie  they didnt quit they were massacred  by like a gazillion angry mexicans  let me put it this way  your gross receipts on this one order  will be over 3000 for one nights work  you guys get started   what are you doing  going online to buy shoes  shell be coming round the mountain when she comes  shell be coming round the mountain when she comes  shell be coming round the mountain  you know if i wanted to spend my saturday nights doing this  i could have stayed in india  stop with the fake third world crap  your fathers a gynecologist and you had a house full of servants  we only had four servants  and two of them were children  how we doing  we have 128 assorted penny blossoms ready to ship  were never gonna finish in time  who made sheldon the boss anyway  i believe im hearing some negativity on the factory floor   so  penny  the labor force is a living organism that must be carefully nurtured  any counterproductive grumbling must be skillfully  headed off by management observe  less talk more work   nicely done  thank you  you hear any union talk you let me know  someones in the kitchen with dinah  someones in the kitchen i knowowowow  someones in the kitchen with dinah  cause i sold my soul to the company store   honey do you want some coffee  i dont drink coffee  but if you dont stay awake well never finish in time  sorry coffees out of the question when i moved to california  i promised my mother that i wouldnt start doing drugs  leonard help  sheldon we still have 380 of these things to make  i have complete faith that you will make them  good night  but sheldon without your insight and leadership  this entire enterprise will surely fail  youre right of course  here this will help  very well  but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics  youre going to have to answer to my mother  look at plancks constant  people say its arbitrary it could not be less arbitrary  if it varied slightly life as we know it would not exist  bam  now now lets reconsider the entire argument  but with entropy reversed  and effect preceding cause  so you are thinking of a universe thats not expanding from the center  no it is retreating from a from a possibility space  this is a space where we are all essentially  alice through the looking glass standing in front of the red queen  and were being offered a cracker to quench our thirst  of course in another universe lets call it universe prime  we should have let him go to bed  i cant believe we actually did it   i just want you guys to know i am really grateful for your help  and for ever dollar i make im going to give you 20 cents  thats your entire profit margin  then never mind  ill print out the shipping label  what  we got an email from the east rutherford new jersey  gay lesbian bisexual and transgender alliance  they want another thousand penny blossoms  really  oneday rush  i really need to take that off the web site  guess wed better get started  you cant be serious  come on  what about the living organism of the workforce  and the american spirit  and jiminy crockett at the alamo  davy crockett jiminy crockett was a cricket  yes i know that okay im tired ive had like 18 cups of coffee  the point is if we just pull together  we can do this whos with me  although you may find it hard to believe  we do have lives  sorry  my apologies to the gay community of east rutherford new jersey  wheres the coffee  were all out  no problem  ill be back before this banana hits the ground  sorry guys but secret agent laser obstacle lunch is just stupid
