                your argument is lacking on all scientific merit  and it is well established superman cleans his uniform  by flying into earth yellow sun which incinerate any contaminate matter  and leaves the unvulnerable kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh  what if he gets something kryptonian on it   like what  i dont know kryptonian mustard  i think we can safely assume that all kryptonian condiments  were destroyed when the planet krypton exploded  or it turned into mustard kryptonite  the only way to destroy a rogue kryptonian hotdog threatening earth  raj please lets stay serious here  supermans body is kryptonian therefore his sweat is kryptonian  what about kryptonian pit stains  superman doesnt sweat on earth  hes invited for dinner in the bottle city of kandor  he miniaturizes himself enters the city where he loses his superpowers  before dinner his host says  whos up for a little kryptonian tetherball  superman says sure works up a sweat comes back to earth

officially a bromance  are you and leonard putting up a christmas tree  no because we dont celebrate  the ancient pagan festival of saturnalia   saturnalia  gather round kids  its time for sheldons beloved christmas special  in the prechristian era  as the winter solstice approached and the plants died  pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes  as an act of sympathetic magic  intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring  this custom was later appropriated by northern europeans  and eventually it becomes the socalled christmas tree  and that charlie brown is what boredom is all about  thank you for that but i got you and leonard  a few silly neighbor gifts so ill just put them under my tree  wait you bought me a present  why would you do such a thing  cause its christmas  i know you think youre being generous  but the foundation of giftgiving is reciprocity  you havent given me a gift youve given me an obligation  dont feel bad penny its a classic rookie mistake  my first hanukah with sheldon he yelled at me for eight nights  you dont have to get me anything in return  of course i do the essence of the custom  is that i now have to go out and purchase a gift of commensurate value  and representing the same perceived level of friendship  as that represented by the gift youve given me  its no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year  forget it im not giving you a present  its too late i see it that elf sticker says to sheldon  the die has been cast the moving finger has writ  hannibal has crossed the alps  i know its funny when its not happening to us  sheldon i am very very sorry  no i brought this on myself  by being such an endearing and important part of your life  im going to need a ride to the mall  its happening to us   are you gonna make it  yeah i guess  thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle  no problem  i had no idea it was so heavy  the thing just fell right over on me didnt it  yeah lucky for you it wasnt

so its your motorcycle   is it okay  its fine  lucky for the bike it landed on my leg  you mind giving me a hand with speed racer here   how do you know leonard  im a physicist  no youre not  why is that so surprising  well its just that the physicists i know  are indoorsy and pale  im not indoorsy i just wear the appropriate sun block  because i dont take melanoma lightly  so are you and leonard working on an experiment together   actually we are  were examining the radiation levels  of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector  sweetie sweetie dave was talking  you know i love science   since when  since always  call me a geek but i am just nuts  for the whole subatomic particle thing  the last thing i would ever call you is a geek  well thats what i am queen of the nerds  if you like i could show you the lab were working in  weve got some cool toys you know lasers and stuff  you know i have always wanted to see a big science lab   since when  since always  leonard are you okay here   i guess  how about we go see it now  maybe afterwards we take the bike we grab a little bite to eat  yeah that sounds great let me just get my jacket  boy shell do huh  yeah if you like that type  so you and her   no just neighbors  really  i dont know how you live next door to that  without doing something about it  actually  science is my lady   okay lets go  all right   see you tomorrow leonard  see ya  have fun  did you forget your key  i dont see anything in here a woman would want  youre kidding  youve got lotions and bath oils and soaps  thats the estrogen hat trick

following conundrum at your feet  which size  this one lets go   you put no thought into that  im sorry  this one lets go  i have insufficient data to proceed  excuse me miss  if i were to give you this gift basket  based on that action alone and no other data  infer and describe the hypothetical relationship  that exists between us  excuse me  here  now are we friends  colleagues lovers  are you my grandmother  i dont understand what youre talking about  and youre making me a little uncomfortable  see sounds just like you and penny well take it   leonard come join us  hey dave  and penny

please shut up  so dave  dont you think you and i should get back to the lab  you know that dark matter isnt going to detect itself  actually i was thinking about taking the afternoon off  so i could work on another experiment with penny  really were going to do an experiment  were going to explore the effects of tequila shots  on a gorgeous 22yearold woman  its not an experiment you saw what happened last night   you ready to go  yeah   can i drive the motorcycle  yeah why not  you cant do any worse than leonard  thats funny  by the way my leg is killing me thanks for asking  great news leonard  ive solved my penny gift dilemma  yippee  you see the danger was that i might under or overreciprocate  but i have devised a foolproof plan  see i will open her gift to me first  and then excuse myself feigning digestive distress  then  ill look up the price of her gift online  choose the basket closest to that value  give it to her  and then ill return the others for a full refund  brilliant  it is isnt it  is it okay if i hide them in your room  the smell makes me nauseated   do whatever you want  thank you thats very gracious  gentlemen  why couldnt you have just done what leonard did  and get penny a new boyfriend  my leg is killing me thanks for asking  i have just one question for you  while i am perfectly happy with the way things are between us  you said you didnt want to go out with me  because i was too smart for you  news flash lady  david underhill is ten times smarter than me  youd have to drive a railroad spike into his brain  for me to beat him at checkers  next to him im like one of those signlanguage gorillas  who knows how to ask for grapes  so my question is  whats up with that  why are you yelling at me  sorry im sorry im sorry  never mind were cool  dave is not smarter than you hes an idiot  really why would you say that  because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife  off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos  of his girlfriend  he tried to take nude photos of you  thats what you took from that  the guy is married  im so oh thats terrible  and you if you are so okay with the way things are between us  why are you so jealous  the important thing is hes married and thats terrible  nice save genius  eggnog  lactose  its just rum it stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago  smooth  smoother than you  come on
