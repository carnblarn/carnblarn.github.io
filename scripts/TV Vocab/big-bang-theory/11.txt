heidelberg institute in germany  studying abroad  no visiting professor  anyway the local cuisine was a little more sausagebased  than im used to and the result was an internal blitzkrieg  with my lower intestine playing the part of czechoslovakia  and there was no one there to take care of you  my mom had to fly back to texas to help my dad  because the house had slipped off the cinder blocks again   again  it was tornado season  and it was an aluminum house  the housekeeper in the faculty residence didnt speak any english  when i finally managed to convince her i was sick  she said mchtest du eine darmsplung  what does that mean  based on what happened next i assume it means  would you like an enema  okay sweetie ill take care of you  what do you need  my mom used to give me

thing  this is a subsonic impact sensor  if sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk  this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop  at that point based on the geography of the apartment  and the ambulatory speed of a sick sheldon  youll have 7 seconds to get out glasses or no glasses  wont my footsteps set it off  no youll be on your hands and knees  youll need to get the sensor as close as you can to sheldons room  how do i carry it if im on my hands and knees  stay low  bear left   now keep true  what   it means go straight  then just say go straight  you dont say go
