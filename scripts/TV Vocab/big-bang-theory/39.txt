                smell that  thats the smell of new comic books  theyre on me today boys  youre paying  have you been selling your sperm again  no im celebrating  as we speak the space shuttle is docking  at the international space station  where it will deploy the wolowitz zerogravity waste disposal system  get over yourself its a hightech toilet  just think thanks to your hard work an international crew of astronauts  will boldly go where no man has gone before   is that supposed to be funny  i believe it is  the combination of the star trek reference  and the play on words involving the doublemeaning of the verb to go  suggests that leonard is mocking your efforts in space plumbing  okay make your little jokes  but of the four of us im the only one making  any realworld contribution to science and technology  hes right this is an important achievement for two reasons  number one  and of course number two  clever  playing on the use of cardinal numbers  as euphemisms for bodily functions  here sheldon i pulled the new hellboy for you  its mindblowing  excuse me  spoiler alert  i didnt spoil anything  you told me its mindblowing  so my mind is going into it preblown  and once a mind is preblown it cannot be reblown  im sorry  said the grinch to christmas   can i talk to you about something  whats up  remember i went out with penny a couple weeks ago   yeah vaguely  sure you remember  you went to the bar and made a fool of yourself  trying to pick up strange women  what about it  the thing is the date didnt go that well  too bad  i guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up  dust yourself off forget it and move on   i cant do that  why the hell not  cause were going out again tomorrow  excuse me stuart  have you read the new flash  well i have and it will knock your socks off  good luck getting them back on  this is probably my last shot with penny and i dont want to screw it up  nobody wants that  so heres my question its the second date  you think shell be expecting things  to get physical  gee  my initial reaction is no  but let me think about it and get back to you  so youll give me a call   yeah or you call me  great  or nobody calls anyone  interesting  pennys current suitor asking advice from her former suitor  you know thanks for closedcaptioning my pain raj  hey wanna make sure he gets nowhere with penny  without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them  im listening  just tell him to do everything youve done with her  for the last two years   the fw team   hows it going  good good you  fine  can i ask you something  sure  you know your friend stuart  he asked me out again and i said yes  and then i started thinking maybe i should talk to you first  about what  does it bother you me going out with one of your friends  cause you know you and me  no thats the past  im really more of a right now kind of guy  you know living in the moment  although i do have to live a little in the future cause thats my job  of course my fondness for classic science fiction  does draw my attention backwards  but those stories often take place in the future  in conclusion no it doesnt bother me  okay well thats really cool of you  i wouldnt say cool id just say thats leonard  in that case do you mind giving me some advice  about stuart  love to  hes very shy  how do i make him feel more comfortable around me  first of all dont underestimate the value of discomfort  really  stuart thrives under pressure  thats why he works in a comic book store  its stuart  youre not going to answer it  he wants to talk about penny i dont want to talk about penny  youre making an assumption  perhaps the comic book store is on fire  and he needs your assistance  why would he call me  we dont know  and if you dont answer the phone we cant know  im not answering the phone  answer the phone leonard  there it went to voice mail  arent you going to check your messages  you have to check your messages  the living of a message is one half of a social contract  which is completed by the checking of the message  if that contract breaks down  then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy  it must be hell inside your head  at times  guys we have a code red  code red the hospital emergency alert the computer worm  or the cherryflavored soft drink from the makers of mountain dew  look i was going over the schematics on my zerog toilet  and i made a teeny tiny mistake  on the specifications for the diverter valve  how teeny tiny  its gonna fail after about ten flushes   but the mission is for six months  see thats the code red  its kind of like a jackinthebox  no one knows exactly when but at some point  something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box  have you notified nasa  are you crazy what am i gonna say  i screwed up your toilet and theres gonna be crap floating  all over your nice shiny space station  what are you gonna do  im gonna figure out how to fix it then ill tell them  so what do you need us for  he cant figure out how to fix it  you said you were gonna be supportive  im trying but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny  i agree  its the juxtaposition of the hightech nature of space exploration  against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet  that provides the comic fodder here  check your messages  all right this is an exact duplicate  of the wolowitz zerogravity human waste disposal system  as deployed on the international space station  dont you mean the wolowitz zerogravity human waste distribution system  good one  its hilarious now  heres an approximation  of the spare parts available on the space station  we gotta find a way using nothing but this  to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine  you mean so it doesnt hit the fan  i have to say  i thought the toilet humor would get less funny with repetition  apparently there is no law  of diminishing comedic returns with space poop  you busy  classified leonard  yeah its a regular manhattan project  whats up  tonights my date with penny  and since we havent been able to connect by phone  im sorry its been broken   or email  yeah that too everythings broken  anyway i was just wondering if you had any lastminute advice  all right well off the top of my head  i think the most important thing with penny is to go really slow  i mean glacial  guys come onto her all the time so you need to set yourself apart  be a little shy  dont make too much eye contact  and you know treat her with like cool detachment  andand you know fear   fear  yeah like  youre afraid that if you touch her shell break  well that plays right into my wheelhouse  good good you kids have fun tonight  thanks leonard  what is that thing anyway  you dont know what this is  good get out  be afraid of penny  nice very crafty  it wasnt bad advice its just wasnt particularly helpful  for what its worth my mother says  that when we deceive for personal gain  we make jesus cry  all right what if we use this twoinch pvc   to reinforce the center crosssupport  no good  it might work for the japanese and the americans  but have you seen the size of the russians they got up there  this thing has to hold up against a hearty potatobased diet  i feel terrible  maybe if you were helping youd feel better about yourself  i deliberately tried to sabotage stuarts date with penny  of course you feel terrible you completely screwed up your karma  you dont really believe in that superstition do you  its not superstition its practically newtonian  for every action theres an equal and opposite reaction  leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a twofaced bitch  therefore he is reborn as a banana slug  its actually a very elegant system you know what goes around comes around  speaking of what goes around comes around  okay look  instead of trying to reinforce this structure here  what if we just ran another line bypass it entirely  it wont work the diameter of the tubing is insufficient  what if we reposition the collection tank  it wont work no way to mount it  okay heres an idea what if i change my name and go live  with my cousin and her husband avi in israel  that could work   morning  morning whats up  nothing we just pulled an allnighter trying to fix a zerogravity  pasta maker  im gonna make a coffee run do you want any  no thanks i have coffee  great so howd it go with stuart last night  i really dont want to talk about it  yeah right sure  the thing is before you guys went out  i spoke to him and  i said i dont want to talk about it  i just i kind of  what goes on between me and stuart is none of your business  so just leave it alone okay  if you want to clean up your karma go get my freakin latte  hang on i think ive got this help me see if we can wedge  this little piece of pvc behind the support rod  youre overestimating the tensile strength  of the substructure youre building  sheldon i know what im doing  if you knew what you were doing there wouldnt be a space toilet  where my coffee table should be  howard wait  why dont you use this instead of the pvc  to keep the transverse filter assembly in place  because this is not a spare part from the space station  this is the thing from the pizza box  that keeps the lid from touching the cheese  that what thats for in india the lid touches the cheese  of course we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera  so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie   where are you going  comic book store  an excellent idea i could certainly use a break   me too  you can go to the comic book store  when man can once again safely poop in space  why does leonard get to go  cause hes upset over his situation with penny  and if i have to hear about it again im going to kick him in his ovaries   thanks for understanding howard  i got your back sister  all right i think weve got a prototype ready to test  hand me that tupperware  thats heavy  damn right its heavy its my mothers meat loaf  its been testing toilets for generations  i must say  i think a detailed letter to mit describing your current circumstances  might entitle you to a refund on your masters degree  okay simulated zerogravity human waste disposal test  with meat loaf analog in  three two one  fascinating  what do you think the problem is  not enough bread crumbs  hey stuart i need to talk to you   sure whats up  i gave you bad advice about penny   and i want to apologize  no your advice was great   it was  yeah going slow really worked  youre kidding  never worked for me  last night at dinner i did what you told me  i went really slow i kept my distance  and two bottles of wine later we were making out in my car  wine i didnt say to give her wine  it doesnt matter thats where it all went to hell  during the kissing  what did you do sneeze in her mouth i did that to a girl once  no everything was good and really hot  and i said  oh penny  and right where she was supposed to say oh stuart she said  your name  that is your name right  im sorry that mustve been the last thing you wanted to hear  it beats you know im a dude right  yeah it was pretty bad  no doubt no doubt  im sorry it didnt work out  not your fault  yeah how about that   see you soon  sure  yes sir i understand classified  well keep it all classified no one has to know but you and me  whats classified  howards space toilet ill tell you later  well theyve deployed our solution  lets just all hope it works  i dont see why i have to worry  my careers not hanging in the balance  that was a joke  its funny  because its true  leonard could you pass the soy sauce please  im sorry were you talking to me  yeah i said leonard  yes you did didnt you  what the hell is that  meatloaf  what was it doing on the ceiling  thats classified  houston international space station  we have a little situation up here  wed like to make an unscheduled space walk  iss houston  which crew members would be involved in this eva  houston wed all like to step outside for a few minutes  iss im afraid we cant authorize that  houston this is more of an fyi call  we are basically out the door
