                here we go pad thai no peanuts  but does it have peanut oil  im not sure  everyone keep an eye on howard in case he starts to swell up  since its not bee season you can have my epinephrine   are there any chopsticks  no need this is thai food  here we go  thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the 19th century  interestingly  they dont put the fork in their mouth  they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth  ask him for a napkin i dare you  ill get it  do i look puffy i feel puffy   hey leonard  oh hi penny   am i interrupting  no youre not swelling howard  look at my fingers theyre like vienna sausages   sounds like you have company  theyre not going anywhere  so youre coming home from work thats great how was work  you know its a cheesecake factory  people order cheesecake and i bring it to them  so you kind of act like a carbohydrate delivery system  yeah call it whatever you want i get minimum wage  i was wondering if you could help me out   with something  yes  great im having some furniture  delivered tomorrow and i may not be here so  hello   im sorry  havent you ever been told  how beautiful you are in flawless russian  no i havent  get used to it  yeah i probably wont   hey sheldon  hi  hey raj  still not talking to me huh  dont take it personally its his pathology  he cant talk to women  it cant talk to atractive woman or in your case  a cheesecake scented goddess  so theres gonna be some furniture delivered  if it gets here and im not here could you sign  and have them put it in my apartment  no problem  great heres my spare key thank you  penny wait  if you dont have any other plans do you want to join us  for thai food and a superman movie marathon  a marathon how many superman movies are there  youre kidding right  i do like the one where lois lane falls from the helicopter  and superman swooshes down and catches her which one was that  one  you realize that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy  yes i know men cant fly  no lets assume that they can  lois lane is falling  accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second  superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel  miss lane who is now traveling  at approximately 120 miles an hour  hits them and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces  unless superman matches her speed and decelerates  in what space sir shes two feet above the ground  frankly if he really loved her hed let her hit the pavement  itd be a more merciful death  excuse me your entire argument is predicated on the assumption  that supermans flight is a feat of strength  are you listening  to yourself it is well established  that his flight is a feat of strength  it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings  an ability he derives from exposure to earths yellow sun  and how does he fly at night  a combination of the moons solar reflection  and the energystorage capacity of kryptonian skin cells  im just gonna go wash up  i have 2600 comic books in there i challenge you  to find a single reference to kryptonian skin cells  challenge accepted  were locked out  also the pretty girl left  o our whole universe was in a hot dense state o  o then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started wait o  o the earth began to cool o  o the autotrophs began to drool neanderthals developed tools o  o we built the wall o o we built the pyramid so  o math science history unraveling the mystery o  o that all started with a big bang o  season 1 episode 2 the big bran hypothesis  her apartments on the fourth floor but the elevators broken so  youre just gonna be done okay cool thanks  well just bring it up ourselves  i hardly think so  why not  well we dont have a dolly  or lifting belts or any measurable upperbody strength  we dont need strength were physicists  we are the intellectual descendants of archimedes  give me a fulcrum and a lever and i can move the earth  its just a matter of i dont have this  archimedes would be so proud  do you have any ideas  yes but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring  easy easy  now weve got an inclined plane the force required to lift  is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs  call it 30 degrees so about half  exactly half  exactly half  lets push  see its moving this is easy  its all in the math   whats your formula for the corner  what  okay no problem  just come up here help me pull and turn  ah gravity thou art a heartless bitch  you do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds  of you having sexual congress with this woman  men do things for women without expecting sex  those would be men who just had sex  im doing this to be a good neighbor  in any case theres no way it could lower the odds  almost there  almost there   almost there  no were not   im sorry  no were not  watch your fingers  oh god my fingers   you okay  no her  great caesars ghost look at this place  so pennys a little messy  a little messy  the mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy  this is chaos  excuse me  explain to me an organizational system  where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid  im just inferring this is a couch  because the evidence suggests the coffee table  is having a tiny garage sale  did it ever occur to you that not everyone has  the compulsive need to sort organize and label  the entire world around them  no  well they dont  hard as it may be for you to believe  most people dont sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fiber content  excuse me but i think weve both found that helpful at times   come on we should go  hang on   what are you doing  im straightening up  this is not your home  this is not anyones home this is a swirling vortex of entropy  when the transvestite lived here you didnt care how he kept the place  because it was immaculate  i mean you opened that mans closet  it was left to right evening gowns  cocktail dresses then his police uniforms  what were you doing in his closet  i helped him run some cable for a web cam  this just arrived we just brought this up just now  great was it hard getting it up the stairs   no  no  no  no  well well get out of your hair  okay great thank you again  i just want you to know that you dont have to live like this  im here for you  whats he talking about   its a joke  i dont get it  yeah he didnt tell it right  pennys sleeping  are you insane  you cant just break into a womans apartment  in the middle of the night and clean  i had no choice i couldnt sleep knowing  that just outside my bedroom was our living room  and just outside our living room was that hallway  and immediately adjacent to the hallway was this  do you realize that if penny wakes up  there is no reasonable explanation as to why were here  i just gave you a reasonable explanation  no no you gave me an explanation  its reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers  dont be ridiculous i have no peers  we have to get out of here  you might want to speak in a lower register  what  evolution has made women sensitive  to highpitched noises while they sleep  so that theyll be roused by a crying baby  if you want to avoid waking her  speak in a lower register  thats ridiculous  no  thats ridiculous  fine  i accept your premise now please lets go  im not leaving until im done  if you have time to lean you have time to clean  oh what the hell  morning  morning  i have to say i slept splendidly  granted not long but just deeply and well  im not surprised  a wellknown folk cure for insomnia  is to break in your neighbors apartment and clean  sarcasm  you think  granted my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox  but i think the end result will be a measurable enhancement   to pennys quality of life  youve convinced me  maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet   you dont think that crosses a line  yes  for gods sake  do i have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time i open my mouth  you have a sarcasm sign  no i do not have a sarcasm sign  do you want some cereal i feel so good today  im gonna choose from the lowfiber end of the shelf  hello honey puffs  son of a bitch  pennys up  you sick geeky bastards  how did she know it was us  i may have left a suggested organizational schematic  for her bedroom closet  god this is gonna be bad  goodbye honey puffs hello big bran  you came into my apartment last night while i was sleeping  yes but only to clean  really more to organize youre not actually dirty per se  give me back my key  im very very sorry  do you understand how creepy this is  oh yes we discussed it at length last night  in my apartment while i was sleeping  and snoring and thats probably just a sinus infection  but it could be sleep apnea  you might want to see an otolaryngologist  a throat doctor  and what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses  depending on the depth  thats either a proctologist  or a general surgeon  i think what youre feeling  is perfectly valid and maybe a little bit later  when youre feeling a little less for lack of a better word violated  maybe we can talk about this some more   stay away from me  sure thats another way to go  penny penny  just to clarify  because there will be a discussion when you leave  is your objection solely to our presence  in the apartment while you were sleeping  or do you also object to the imposition of a new organizational paradigm  well that was a little nonresponsive  you are going to march yourself over there right now and apologize  whats funny  that wasnt sarcasm  boy you are all over the place this morning  i have a masters and two phds i should not have to do this  what  i am truly sorry for what happened last night  i take full responsibility  and i hope that it wont color your opinion of leonard  who is not only a wonderful guy but also i hear  a gentle and thorough lover  i did what i could  hey raj  hey listen  i dont know if you heard about what happened last night  but im really upset about it  i mean they just they let themselves into my place  and then they cleaned it can you even believe that  how weird is that  shes standing very close to me  oh my she does smell good  what is that vanilla  you know where i come from  if someone comes into your house at night you shoot okay  and you dont shoot to wound  i mean all right my sister shot her husband  but it was an accident they were drunk  wait what was i saying  shes so chatty  maybe my parents are right  maybe id be better off with an indian girl  wed have the same cultural background  and my wife could sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me  its obvious that they meant well but  im having a really rough time i broke up with my boyfriend  and  just because most of the men ive known in my life happen to be jerks  doesnt mean i should just assume leonard and sheldon are  right  she asked me a question i should probably nod  thats exactly what i thought  thank you for listening youre a doll  turn your pelvis  grab a napkin homie you just got served  its fineyou win  whats his problem  his imaginary girlfriend broke up with him  been there  sorry im late  but i was in the hallway chatting up penny  really you rajesh koothrappali spoke to penny  actually i was less the chatter than the chatee  what did she say is she still mad at me  well she was upset at first  but probably because her sister shot somebody  but then there was something about you  and then she hugged me  she hugged you howd she hug you  is that her perfume i smell  intoxicating isnt it  hi  whats going on  heres the thing  just as oppenheimer came to regret his contributions  to the first atomic bomb  so too i regret my participation in what was  at the very least an error in judgment  the hallmark of the great human experiment  is the willingness to recognize ones mistakes  some mistakes such as madam curies discovery of radium  turned out to have great scientific potential  even though she would later die a slow painful death from radiation poisoning  another example from the field of ebola research  were okay   six two inch dowels  check   one package phillips head screws  check  you guys seriously i grew up on a farm okay  i rebuilt a tractor engine when i was like 12  i think i can put together a cheap swedish media center  no please we insist its the least we can do considering  considering what  how great this place looks   oh boy i was afraid of this  what  these instructions are a pictographic representation  of the least imaginative way to assemble these components  this right here is why sweden has no space program  well it looked pretty good in the store  it is an inefficient design for example she has a flat screen tv  which means all the space behind it is wasted   we could put her stereo back there  and control it how  run an infrared repeater  photo cell here emitter here easypeasy  how are you gonna cool it   hey guys i got this  hang on penny  how about fans here and here  also inefficient and might be loud  how about liquid coolant maybe a little aquarium pump here  run some quarterinch pvc  guys this is actually really simple  hold on honey men at work  the pvc comes down here  maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here  yeah show me where we put a drip tray a sluice and an overflow reservoir  if waters involved were gonna have to ground the crap out of the thing  its hot in here i think ill just take off all my clothes  oh ive got it  what about if we replace  panels a b and f and crossbar h with aircraftgrade aluminum  right then the entire thing is one heat sink  you and sheldon go to the junkyard and pick up   raj and i will get the oxyacetylene torch   meet back here in an hour  done  okay this place does look pretty good
