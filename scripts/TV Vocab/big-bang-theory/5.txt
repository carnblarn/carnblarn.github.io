                all right im moving my infantry division  augmented by bataillon of orcs from lord of the rings  we flank the tennessee volunteers  and the north once again wins the battle of gettysburg  not so fast  remember the south still has two infantry divisions  plus superman and godzilla  no orcs are magic superman is vulnerable to magic  not to mention you already lost godzilla to the illinois cavalry and hulk  why dont you just have robert e lee charge the line with shiva and ganesh   you guys ready to order  hang on honey  shiva and ganesh  the hindu gods against the entire union army  and orcs  ill be back  excuse me  ganesh is the remover of obstacles and shiva is the destroyer  when the smoke clears abraham lincoln will be speaking hindi  and drinking mint juleps  my boss says you have to either order or leave and never come back  what do you recommend for someone who worked up a mansized appetite  from a morning of weight training and cardio funk  a shower  ill take the heart smart platter  all right thank you and sheldon  we dont eat here i dont know whats good   its all good  statistically unlikely  just get a hamburger you like hamburgers  i like hamburgers where we usually have them  you cant make the assumption that ill like them here  im sorry   give him a hamburger  which one  the classic burger the ranch house burger  the barbecue burger or the kobe burger  cant we just go to big boy  they only have one burger the big boy  the barbecue burgers like the big boy  excuse me in a world that already includes a big boy  why would i settle for something like a big boy  because youre not at big boy   fine ill have the barbecue burger  make it two  waitresses dont yell at you at big boy  hey leonard hi guys  hi leslie  i didnt know you ate here  we dont this is a disturbing aberration  leslie this is penny  she lives across the hall from sheldon and me  and walks in quiet beauty like the night  howard ive asked you not to do that  leslie and i do research together at the university  wow a girl scientist  yep come for the breasts stay for the brains  glad i ran into you  the physics department string quartet needs a new cellist  what happened to elliot wong  he switched over to highenergy radiation research  had a little mishap and now the other guys  are uncomfortable sitting next to him   youre in  yeah sure why not  great we rehearse on tuesdays at your place  why at my place  department of energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone   nice meeting you  yeah you too  i didnt know you played the cello  yeah my parents felt that naming me leonard  and putting me in advanced placement classes  wasnt getting me beaten up enough  if youre into music i happen to be a human beatbox  really  im actually not that into music  your friends really cute  anything going on with you two  leslie  no no   what are you kidding  he asked her out once  it was an embarrassing failure   thank you sheldon  im sorry  was that supposed to be a secret  thats too bad you guysd make a cute couple  oh dear   whats the matter  she didnt take my order  how can she take your order when youre too neurotic to talk to her  nevertheless this will be reflected in her tip  what did penny mean youd make a cute couple  i assume she meant the two of you together  would constitute a couple that others might consider cute  an alternate and somewhat less likely interpretation  is that you could manufacture one  as in look leonard and leslie made mr and mrs goldfarb  arent they adorable  if penny didnt know that leslie had turned me down  then it would unambiguously mean  that she penny thought i should ask her leslie out  indicating that she had no interest in me asking her penny out  but because she did know that i had asked leslie out  and that she leslie had turned me down then she penny  could be offering consolation  thats too bad you would have made a cute couple  but while thinking good leonard remains available  youre a lucky man leonard   how so  youre talking to one of the three men  in the western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought  well what do you think  i said i could follow it i didnt say i care  season 1 episode 5 the hamburger postulate  i admire your fingering  thank you  maybe sometime you can try that on my instrument   gnight guys good job  thanks  see you next week   that was fun thanks for including me  youre welcome  if youre up for it we could practice that middle section again  sure why not  just so were clear you understand  that me hanging back to practice with you  is a pretext for letting you know that im sexually available  really  yeah im good to go  i thought you werent interested in me  that was before i saw you handling  that beautiful piece of wood between your legs  you mean my cello  no i mean the obvious crude double entendre  im seducing you  no kidding  what can i say im a passionate and impulsive woman  so how about it  is it the waitress  what about her  i thought i saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her  which unless youre a heroin addict points to sexual attraction  i did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast  which could cause a positive urine test for opiates  but certainly not dilate my pupils  so i guess there was no point in bringing it up  you and the waitress then  no no  theres nothing going on between penny and me  so youre open to a sexual relationship  yeah yeah i guess i am   good  yeah it is it is good  did you want to start now  why dont we finish the section first  a little musical foreplay terrific  im good to go  me too  hey sheldon whats going on  i need your opinion on a matter of semiotics  im sorry  semiotics the study of signs and symbols  its a branch of philosophy related to linguistics  okay sweetie i know you think youre explaing yourself  but youre really not  just come with me   well  well what  what does it mean  oh come on you went to college  yes but i was 11  all right look a tie on the doorknob usually means  someone doesnt want to be disturbed  because theyre you know gettin busy  so youre saying leonard has a girl in there  well either that or hes lost his tie rack  and gotten really into bryan adams  oh leonard you magnificent beast  we really shouldnt be standing here  this is very awkward  oh come on leonards had girls over before right  yes but theres usually planning courtship advance notice  last time i was able to book a cruise to the arctic to see a solar eclipse  you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex  i didnt have to the dates just happened to coincide  so do you know whos in there  well theres leonard  and hes either with leslie winkle or a 1930s gangster  good for him  good for leonard  okay gnight  no no wait hold on  whats the matter  i dont know what the protocol is here  do i stay do i leave  do i wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage  youre asking the wrong girl  im usually on the other side of the tie  hi leonard  its me sheldon  in the living room  i just i wanted you to know i saw the tie  message received  youre welcome  you carry on  give my best to leslie  big boy  someone touched my board  oh god my board  hey whats the matter  my equations someones tampered with my equations   are you sure  of course i am  look at the beta function of quantum chromodynamics  the signs been changed  oh yeah  but doesnt that fix the problem youve been having  are you insane are you out of your mind  are you look  that fixes the problem ive been having  youre welcome  you did this  i noticed it when i got up to get a glass of water so i fixed it  now you can show that quarks are asymptotically free at high energies  pretty cool huh  cool  listen ive got to get to the lab thanks for a great night  thank you ill see you at work  hold on hold on   what  who told you you could touch my board  no one  i dont come into your house and touch your board  there are no incorrect equations on my board  oh that is so  so  sorry ive got to run if you come up with an adjective text me  inconsiderate  that is the adjective inconsiderate   you can stare at your board all day shes still going to be right  im not staring im hauling  so  hows it going  pretty good  just pretty good id think you were doing very good  pretty very theres really no objective scale  for delineating variations of good why do you ask  well a little bird told me  that you and leslie hooked up last night  so is it serious do you like her  i dont  thats really two different questions  im not  sheldon we have to go  youre wound awfully tight for a man whos just had sexual intercourse  all right ill talk to you later but i am so happy for you  thank you  what did she mean shes happy for me  is she happy that im seeing someone  or is she happy because she thinks that i am  because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy  even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy  because the second person though happy  is now romantically unavailable to the first person  do you realize i may have to share a nobel prize with your booty call  you know what  im being ridiculous  who cares what penny thinks  leslie is a terrific girl shes attractive  we like each other shes extremely intelligent   shes not that intelligent  she fixed your equation   she got lucky  you dont believe in luck  i dont have to believe in it for her to be lucky  regardless i have a chance at a real relationship with leslie  im not going to pass that up  for some hypothetical future of happiness with a woman  who may or may not want me to be happy  with a woman who is currently making me happy  i still dont care  careful leonard liquid nitrogen  why are you smashing a flashfrozen banana  because i got a bowl of cheerios and i couldnt find a knife  so anyway  hello  what are you doing  just extending the intimacy  do you want to slip over to the radiation lab  and share a decontamination shower  what exactly do you thinks going on between us  im not sure but i think im about to discover how the banana felt  listen neither of us are neuroscientists  but we both understand the biochemistry of sex  i mean dopamine in our brains  is released across synapses causing pleasure  you stick electrodes in a rats brain give him an orgasm button  hell push that thing until he starves to death  well who wouldnt  well the only difference between us and the rat  is that you cant stick an electrode in our hypothalamus  thats where you come in  yeah well im just glad to be a part of it  so what happens now  i dont know about your sex drive but im probably good till new years   thank you  thank you  you want to make plans for new years  please youre smothering me  look its dr stud  dr what  the blogosphere is abuzzin with news of you and leslie winkle  making eine kleine bangbang musik  how did it get on the internet  i put it there  how did you know about it  a little bird told us  apparently you are a magnificent beast  that parts true  i think i may have misjudged this restaurant   no kidding  i dont want to go out on a limb  but i think we may be looking at my new tuesday hamburger  your old tuesday hamburger will be so brokenhearted  way ahead of you i was thinking of moving big boy to thursdays  and just dropping souplantation  really  the name always confused me anyway souplantation  you cant grow soup  so hows everything  terrific youll be happy to know that i plan to come here  every tuesday night for the foreseeable future  really  who do i speak to about permanently reserving this table  i dont know a psychiatrist  so hey  how are things with you and leslie  to be honest i dont think its going to work out  oh thats too bad  hey dont worry  im sure theres someone out there whos just right for you  what did she mean by that  was that just a generic platitude  or was that a subtle bid for attention  you know why this hamburger surpasses the big boy  this is a singledecker hamburger whereas the big boy is a doubledecker  this has a much more satisfying meattobuntocondiment ratio  are you even listening to me  of course im listening blah blah hopeless penny delusion  okay then  you know you can grow the ingredients for soup
