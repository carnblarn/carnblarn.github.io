                ok  the x10s are online  gentlemen i am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local isp  racing down fibre optic cable at the speed of light to san fransisco  bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to lisbon portugal  where the data packets will be headed off to submerge transatlantic cables  terminating in halifax nova scotia  and transfered across the continent via microwave relays back to our isp  and the extend receiver attached to this  lamp  look at me look at me ive got goosebumps   are we ready for the stereo  go for stereo   hey guys  hello  its a little loud  no problem turning it down  san francisco lisbon halifax  et voil   ok thanks  hang on hang on do you not realise what we just did  yeah you turned your stereo down with your laptop  no we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet  oh you know you can get one of those universal remotes from radioshack  theyre really cheap  no you dont get it howard   enable public access  public access enabled   boy thats terrific ill see ya  no hang on hang on  see  no  someone in sichuan province china is using his computer  to turn our lights on and off  oh thats handy  heres a question why  because we can  they found our remote control cars   wait whats on top of that  wireless webcams wave hello  the monster truck is out of austin texas  and the blue viper is being operated from suburban tel aviv   you may want to put on slacks  what  ew stop it no leave me alone   whos running the red corvette  that would be me   you know in the future when were disembodied brains in jars  were going to look at this as eight hours well wasted  i dont want to be in a jar i want my brain in an android body  eight feet tall and ribbed  im with you  i just have to make sure if im a synthetic human id still be jewish  i promised my mother  i suppose you could have your android penis circumcised  but thats something your rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturer  not to mention youd have to power down on saturdays  sheldon why is this letter in the trash  well theres always the possibility that  a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter  but occams rasor would suggest that someone threw it out  its from the institute of experimental physics they want us to  present our paper on the properties of supersolids  at the topical conference of boseeinstein condensates  i know i read it before i threw it out  ok if i may drill down to the bedrock of my question  why did you throw it out  because i have no interest in standing in the rose room of the pasadena marriot  in front of a group of judgmental strangers  who wouldnt recognise true genius if it was standing in front of them giving a speech  which if i were there would be  i dont know sheldon  those topical conferences on boseeinstein condensates parties are legendary   forget the parties  forget the parties what a nerd  are there any other honours ive got that i dont know about  did the ups dropped off a nobel prize with my name on it  leonard please dont take this the wrong way but the day you win a nobel prize  is the day i begin my research on the drag coefficient of tassles on flying carpets  the only thing missing from that insult was your mama  i got one hey leonard   your mamas research methodology is so flawed  shut up howard   sheldon we have to do this  no we dont  we have to take a nourishment to expel waste  and inhale enough oxygen to keep our cells from dying  everything else is optional  ok let me put it this way im doing it  you cant im the lead author  come on the only reason youre the lead author is because we went alphabetically  i let you think we went alphabetically to spare you  the humiliation with dealing with the fact that it was my idea  now to put too fine a point to it but i was throwing you a bone  youre welcome  excuse me i designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis  that doesnt mean proving  so the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word  theyre not supposed to but they should  alright i dont care what you say  im going to the conference and im presenting our findings  and i forbid it  you forbid it  if im not taking credit for our work then nobody is   so you admit that its our work  no  once again im throwing you a bone  and once again you are welcome  so hows it going with sheldon are you guys still not talking to each other  not only is he still not talking to me  but theres this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode  you know like in the classic scifi movie scanners  like  bzzz  nevermind  how about this one  it says i know my physics but im still a fun guy  oh i didnt know they still made corduroy suits  they dont thats why i saved this one  ok well lets just see what else you have  ok here take this  and this and this and this and these  is this all stuff you want me to try on  no this is stuff i want you to throw out  seriously dont even give it to charity you wont be helping anyone  whats this  thats the bottled city of kandor  you see kandor was the capital city of the planet krypton  it was miniaturised by brainiac before krypton exploded  and then rescued by superman  oh nice  its a lot cooler when girls arent looking at it  here why dont you put these while i find a shirt and a sport cut match  right be right back  where are you going just put them on  here  oh are you shy   no im not shy  dont worry i wont look  i know you wont look why would you look  theres nothing to see well not nothing  sweetie put the pants on  so you know isnt there maybe some way you and sheldon could   compromise on this whole presentation thing  no no  scientists do not compromise  our minds are trained to synthetize facts  and come to inarguable conclusions  not to mention sheldon is backcrap crazy  what is this  oh careful  thats my original series battlestar galactica flight suit  oh why didnt you wear it on halloween  because its not a costume its a flight suit  ok alright moving on  oh wow a paisley shirt  it goes with my corduroy suit  if you mean it should end up in the same place then i agree  is this your only tie  technically yes but if youll notice  its reversible  so it works as two  sweetie i dont even think it works as one   is this all your clothes  eh yeah  everything since the eighth grade   the eighth grade  my last growth sprout  ok well lets go back to the curdoroy suit   great  yeah  i said no put it down  hey sheldon  hello penny  get anything good  just the latest copy of applied particle physics quarterly  oh you know that is so weird that yours came and mine didnt  it was a joke  yep  tip you waitresses im here all week  penny just to save you from further awkwardness  know that im perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence  oh yeah ok me too zip it lock it  put it in your pocket   so you and leonard  oh dear god  little misunderstanding huh  a little misunderstanding   galileo and the pope had a little misunderstanding  anyway i was talking to leonard this morning and i think he feels really bad about it  how do you feel  i dont understand the question  im just asking if its difficult to be fighting with your best friend  i havent thought about it like that  i wonder if ive been experiencing physiological manifestations  of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil  wait what  i couldnt poop this morning  you should just talk to him im sure you guys can work this out   certainly preferable to my plan  which was  a powerful laxative  you absolutely should talk to him  look i know leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself  without your little idea theres no way he could come up with this whole experiment thing  excuse me little idea  yeah i mean he tried to explain it to me   i didnt really understand it but  of course you didnt  he said little idea  oh well no not   not in those words  in what words then exactly  oh you know gee the exact words are its more the spirit in which he said   what did he say  you had a lucky hunch  hey sheldon ive been thinking instead of arguing about this  dont you ever speak to me again  what   ok im leaving for the conference  have fun presenting my lucky hunch  shel i didnt mean it like that   then why did you say it  i dont know i wasnt   were you trying to impress penny  no no not at all a little bit  how did that work out for you   leonard ready to go  libido 1 truth 0  ok im gonna ask you one more time  we did the work together lets present the paper together  and im telling you for the last time  its pandering its undignifying and bite me  lets go   bye sheldon  goodbye penny  one of these days bshh  there you go  youre right this side does look better  no no i didnt say better i said less stained  i just checked the house theres probably 2025 people in there   youre kidding  is that all  all  in particle physics 25 is woodstock   then good  i wasnt expecting such a crowd  im all nervous  its ok just open with a joke youll be fine  a joke ok  how about this um ok  theres this farmer  and he has these chickens but they wont lay any eggs so  he calls a physicist to help  the physicist then does some calculations  and he says i have a solution  but it only works for spherical chickens in a vacuum  right  oh sorry i just had heard it before   lets roll hey nice suit  its a classic right  i really should have brought my own car  so in conclusion  the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero  the moment of inertia changes and a solid becomes a supersolid  which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter  thank you   are there any questions  yeah  what the hell was that  any other questions  doctor sheldon cooper here i am the lead author of this particular paper  thank you  and you sir you have completely skipped over the part where i was walking through the park  and i saw these children on a merrygoround which started me thinking  about the moment of inertia in gases like helium  at temperatures approaching absolute zero  i didnt skip it its just an anecdote its not science  oh i see it was the apple falling on newtons head   was that just an anecdote  you are not isaac newton  no no thats true gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple  you cannot possibly be that arrogant  you continue to underestimate me my good man  look if you werent happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me  as i have explained repeatedly unlike you  i dont need validation from lesser minds  no offense  really so why did you come  because i knew youd screw this up  i didnt screw it up  oh please i admit that spherical chicken joke   that was hilarious  thank you  but it was straight downhill from there  ive had enough of your condescendship  maybe i didnt go to college when i was 11 like you  maybe i got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16  but you are not the only person who is smarter than  everyone else in this room  no offense  and i am clearly not the only person  who is tormented by insecurity  and has an ego in need of constant validation  so you admit youre an egotist  yes  my name is doctor leonard hofstadter and i can never please my parents so  i need all my self esteem from strangers like you  but hes worse  ok thats it  stop it  you cannot blow up my head with your mind  then ill settle for your aneurism   stop it  you hit me  you saw that he hit me  you tried to blow up my head  so it was working  it wa it was not youre a nutcase  well see about that  heads up you people in the front row  this is a splash zone  stop it  just quit it  is this usually how these physics things go  more often than you think  you could have offered me a ride home  youre lucky i didnt run you over  i really dont understand what youre so unhappy about  you begged me to come i came  theres just no pleasing you  youre right im the problem im the one that needs help  well thats not much of an apology but ill take it  excuse me  is there anything you would apologise for  yes  im sorry i tried to blow up your head  it was uncalled for  you wont believe this  somebody got the whole thing with their cell phone and put it on youtube  what   who would do that  that would be me  hey check it out its a featured video  he hit me you saw that he hit me   then it was working  it was not working youre a nutcase  we will see about that  you people in the front row heads up  this is splash zone  stop it leave it leave it  you want a volcano nerve pinch  you should clip your fingernails those hurt  oh jeez does this suit really look that bad  forget your suit look at my arms waving  im like a flamingo on ritalin  howard  would you like to explain to me why your facebook page  has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned  me and my girlfriend  uh oh here comes the talk   you hit me  you tried to blow up my head   so it was working  it was not working youre a nutcase  what losers  yeah gigantic american geeks  whos doing that  someone from pasadena california named  wolowizard  awesome
