                no see the liquid metal terminators were created in the future by skynet  and skynet was developed by miles dyson  but that future no longer exists due to dysons death in terminator 2  okay then riddle me this  assuming all the good terminators were originally evil terminators created by skynet  but then reprogrammed by the future john connor  why would skynet an artificial computer intelligence  bother to create a petite hot  skynet is kinky  i dont know  artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes  allright wait they use it to  too late i win  what the hell is that  i dont know but if cats could sing  theyd hate it too  hey guys   hi where you going   what  we just had to mail some letters  and  throw away some chicken  youll never guess what just happened  i give up  i dont guess  as a scientist i reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation  although as im saying this  it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot   what was that   believe it or not personal growth  what happened  allright remember when i auditioned for that workshop production of rent  but i didnt get it and i couldnt figure out why  i have a conclusion based on an observation  no you dont  no he doesnt  well the girl they picked to play mimi  she dropped out and they asked me to replace her  congratulations  what a lucky break  its not a big deal just a onenight showcase  but they invite a lot of casting people and agents  so you never know   i think i know   no you dont  he doesnt  its this friday at 800  do you guys want to come  no  because  friday we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium  i think thats a week from tuesday at 600  no its this friday  at 800  oh too bad  i gotta get to rehearsal   see you guys  see ya  you just lied to penny   yes i did   and you did it so casually  no rapid breathing no increase in perspiration  so  so lack of a physiological response while lying   is characteristic of a violent sociopath  sheldon are you worried about your safety  no i imagine if you were going to kill me  youd have done it a long time ago  thats very true  season 1 episode 10 the loobenfeld decay  leonard  what  i need to speak to you   its 200 in the morning   its important  i highly doubt that  go away  are you still out there  yes  what  youre right it can wait until morning   what what what what what   never mind  i clearly woke you up in the middle of a rem cycle  youre in no state of mind to talk  sheldon what is it  im uncomfortable having been included in your lie to penny  what was i supposed to say   you could have told her the truth   that would have hurt her feelings  is that a relevant factor  yes  then i suppose you couldve agreed to go  and what would i have said afterwards  i would suggest something to the effect of  singing isneither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you  and if you disagree id recommend you have a cat scan to look for a tumor  pressing on the cognitive processing centers of your brain  i couldnt say that i would have to say  you were terrific and i cant wait to hear you sing again  why  its the social protocol  its what you do when you have a friend whos proud of something they really suck at  i was not aware of that  well now you are  oh all right  leonard  yes  when we played chess earlier you were terrific  and i cant wait to play you again  good night  leonard  this would be so much easier if i were a violent sociopath  what  i was analyzing our lie  and i believe were in danger of penny seeing through the ruse  how  simple if she were to log onto wwwsocalphysixsgrouporgactivitiesother  click on upcoming events scroll down to seminars  download the pdf schedule  and look for the seminar on molecular positronium  well then bippity boppity boo  our pants are metaphorically on fire  well sir my trousers will not be igniting today  penny  good morning  do you have any idea what time it is  of course i do  my watch is linked to the atomic clock in boulder colorado  its accurate to one tenth of a second  but as im saying this it occurs to me  that once again your question may have been rhetorical  what do you want  remember how leonard told you we couldnt come to your performance  because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium  i remember symposium  yes well   he lied  wait what  he lied and im feeling very uncomfortable about it  well imagine how im feeling  hungry  tired  im sorry this really isnt my strong suit  you told her i lied  why would you tell her i lied  to help you  im sorry im not seeing the help  she was going to see through your lie eventually  so i told her that you were lying to protect me  im getting a bad feeling  hunger  indigestion  im sorry im really not very good at this  anyway penny now believes that on friday night  were going to participate in my cousin leopolds drug intervention  your cousin leopold  who most people call leo but he also answers to lee   remember that its important   whats important  details leonard the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details   do you have a cousin leopold   no i made him up  i think youd call him lee  i dont get it i already told her a lie  why replace it with a different lie  well first of all your lie was laughably transparent  where mine is exquisitely convoluted  while you were sleeping i was weaving an ununravelable web  ununravelable  yes  if she googles leopold houston shell find a facebook page  an online blog depicting his descent into drug use  and a desperate yet hopeful listing on eharmonycom  okay why would i go to a drug intervention for your cousin  because its in long beach and i dont drive   were going to long beach   of course not   theres no cousin leo  theres no intervention  focus leonard  aw come on  we just leave the house on friday night and we return in the wee hoursemotionally wrung out  from the work of convincing leo to go back into rehab   he goes back into rehab   yes but he can relapse if penny ever invites us to hear her sing again  you still told her i lied  for a noble purpose to spare me the social embarrassment  of having a drugaddled first cousin  which im assuming is embarrassing yes  how am i supposed to remember all of this  thats the best part  you dont have to  i told penny that you would be embarrassed if you knew that she found out that you had lied  so shes agreed to operate as if the original lie is still in force  so shes expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in pasadena  when in actuality were pretending to go to a drug intervention in long beach  ununravelable  hey penny wow look at you all ready for your showcase   you look great   thanks  i just wanted to come by wish you guys luck  with your symposium  thank you  i got to tell you a lot of friends would let their friend go alone  but thats not who you are  you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when  when he has a symposium to go to  i dont know what to say  its okay leonard  okay all right good  oh boy group hug  so whats up  well penny is on her way to perform in a onenight showcase production of rent which we are unable to attend  because were going to a symposium on molecular positronium  given by dr emilarmanfarmian  wait a minute farmanfarmian is speaking and youre bogarting the symposium   howard im sorr   no no youre quarkblocking us  i dont know what to say  howard listen  its okay its your millennium falcon  you and chewbacca do whatever you wanted  me and princess leia here will find some other way to spend the evening  howard wait  sheldon i think we should tell them  okay sure  i dont see a problem with that  theres no symposium  leonard lied to me  isnt that right leonard  well  i dont know what to say  its okay i do  leonard is helping sheldon through a family crisis  he made up the whole story about the symposium with dr farman  farmian  good for you  because he didnt want sheldon to be embarrassed  and theres nothing to be embarrassed about  every family in america has a relative  holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner  no im lost too  i think she skipped a step  no look  sheldons cousin leo escaped rehab and hes in a motel 8 in long beach  the whole familys going out for an intervention  leonard is driving sheldon down there  to help him through this because hes such a good man  another hug thank you  all right you guys good luck  thanks penny  break a leg  break a leg  so road trip to long beach   were not going to long beach   why not  because sheldon doesnt have a drugaddicted cousin leopold  oh too bad  ive always wanted to go to long beach  its a very nice community  the queen mary is docked there  once the largest ocean liner in the world its now a hotel and restaurant  where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner   sounds fun  im game   no no no  leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front and even then its iffy  wait are we really going to long beach  leonard  let it go sheldon  the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not  no thats the least of our worries  ive been doing some research on addiction  both the biochemical and behavioral aspects  and i think theres a problem with the current version of our lie  what are you talking about  its fine she bought it its over  sadly its not  substance abuse is a lifelong struggle  but beyond that i have realized that the leo i described   would not have agreed to go to rehab   why not  because leos a middle child  there is no leo  how can you say that  you didnt read the bio did you  hes not just a middle child he is the quintessential middle child  from a broken home to boot  psychologically speaking the attention he gets by rebelling  even to the point of selfdestruction  is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab   ive got a solution   great what is it  get out  fine  ive hesitated to point this out  but i must now remind you that we are in our current predicament  because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit  im just trying to clean up after your mess  well talk in the morning  morning  who are you  i am sheldons cousin leo  sheldon does not have a cousin leo  au contraire  im 26 years old  im originally from   denton texas but i was a navy brat  so i was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world  as a result ive often felt like an outsider  never really fitting in  which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem  excuse me we just went over this  as the quintessential middle child your addiction is rooted  in your unmet need for attention  sheldon are we really going to go with pop psychology  for your information this is based on solid research  just stick with the character profile i wrote for you  sheldon  im sorry  leonard this is toby loobenfeld  hes a research assistant in the particle physics lab  but he also minored in theater at mit  it was more of a double major actually  theater and physics  you can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me toward  yeah i got it  sheldon   why  you see while leo would not have gone into rehab  it is completely plausible  that we would have talked him into leaving the motel and coming home with us  how about this as my motivation when i was 14 years old  i was abused in the philippines by a clubfooted navy chaplain  no were going with middle child  and a genetic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production  swell how do i play genetic predisposition  subtextually of course  just have fun with it   morning penny   how did the intervention go  unfortunately we werent able to convince him to go to rehab  based on what you told me i am not surprised  but we did convince him to leave the motel  come say hello  leo  this is penny our friend and neighbor  hi leo  how are you feeling  let me ask you something penny  have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel covered in your own vomit  next to a transsexual prostitute  no  then dont ask me how im feeling  well thats leo  why dont you tell me about your showcase last night  it was okay i guess  it wasnt a big turnout but they both really seemed to like it  there were only two people there  by the end yeah  damn you chaplain harrigan  im im sorry  the philippines   the subic bay naval station  a young boy on the cusp of manhood  his only companions  mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitoes  desperate and alone  he reached out to a man who promised to introduce him  to a merciful loving god but who instead introduced him  to a ginpickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat  what choice did he have but to drink shoot and snort his pain away  dont forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction   thats never been proven   there have been studies  not doubleblind studies  how could there be  who would be the control group  as you can see detoxing can get pretty ugly  lets give them some privacy  do you want to come over and have coffee  ah sounds good  i have a video of me singing last night  do you want to see it  gee why wouldnt i  this is even better than you coming to the showcase  because now i get to watch you watch me  yeeaaahh  funny how things work out  but he loved the companionship and the wisdom  that his own father failed to provide  your parents made the right decision  i cannot work like this  this is amazing  just sitting on a couch watching tv with a woman  not being drunk or high  or wondering if youre a dude down there  leo you are a very sweet really funny guy  youre going to do okay  one day at a time penny  one day at a time  how long is he going to stay here  hes a homeless drug addict leonard  where is he going to go  boy you have a lot to learn about lying
