                this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster  i asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on whole wheat   what did they give you  turkey and roast beef  with swiss and lettuce on whole wheat  its the right ingredients but in the wrong order  in a proper sandwich  the cheese is adjacent to the bread  to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce  they might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash   i dont believe it  i know its basic culinary science  some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop  from the original film and no one is bidding on it  a time machine from the movie the time machine  no a time machine from sophies choice  boy sophie could have used a time machine in that movie  did you see it its rough   thats cool  its only 800  yeah and thats my bid  you bid 800  it was a spurofthemoment thing i figured it would go for thousands  and i just wanted to be a part of it  theres only 30 sec left in the auction  do you have 800  not to blow on a miniature time machine  dont worry people wait until the last second to bid  and they swoop in and get it its called sniping   come on snipers    8  where are your snipers   5  snipe   4  snipe   3  snipe   2  snipe   congratulations  you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine  you lucky duck  i wonder why no one else bid  this is a classic piece of scifi movie memorabilia   yeah i know i still cant afford it  why dont we share it  well each put in 200 bucks well take turns having it in our house  a timeshare time machine  im in sheldon  need you ask  i still dont understand why no one else bid  i understand why no one else bid  episode 114 the nerdvana annihilation    did the listing actually say miniature  i just assumed  who sells a fullsize time machine for 800  in a venn diagram that would be an individual located  within the intersection of the sets no longer want my time machine  and need 800  its actually a tremendous bargain  even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound  cocktail shrimp are 1250  how are we going to get it upstairs  if we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator  yes but the elevator has been broken for 2 years  ive been meaning to ask you  do you think we should make a call about that  not necessary i have a masters in engineering  i remotely repair satellites on a regular basis  i troubleshoot space shuttle payloads  when the mars rover started pulling to the left  i performed a frontend alignment  from 62 million miles away  no that babys broken  come on guys push  if i push any harder im going to give birth to my colon  i cant feel my fingers hurry up  its the same amount of work no matter how fast you go   basic physics  sheldon  if my fingers ever work again ive got a job for the middle one   hey guys  hi penny  take a break guys   what are you doing  were just moving something upstairs   what is it  just  you know time machine  neat but i really got to get to work   give us a few minutes  i dont have them im running late  then i have a simple solution  go up to the roof hop over to the next building  theres a small gap dont look down if youre subject to vertigo  and use their stairwell  youre joking right  i never joke when it comes to vertigo  damn okay ill just take the roof  if you wait for us to set up the time machine  i can drop you off at work yesterday  time travel joke its not never mind  for what its worth i thought it was humorous  lets just do this   you guys ready to push  in a minute  howard stepped outside to throw up  i dont know what you were worried about  i think it really works in the room  it is by far the coolest thing i have ever owned  the exact time machine that carried actor rod taylor  from victorian england into the postapocalyptic future  where society had splintered into two factions  the subterranean morlocks who survived by feasting  on the flesh of the gentle surfacedwelling eloi  talk about your chick magnets  the guy who lives next to me is always like  i have a jacuzzi on my balcony i have a jacuzzi on my balcony  but wait until i tell him  ive got a time machine on my balcony  stuff that in your speedoes jacuzzi bob  gentlemen we said wed take turns but i think youll agree  that practicality dictates it remain here  you cant keep it here what if i meet a girl and say  you wanna come up and see my time machine  its at my friends house how lame is that  hes got a point  i think were going to need some ground rules in addition to the expected  no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine  i propose we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine  seconded  i was going to put down a towel  i still want it on my balcony  i say we move it on a bimonthly basis   that sounds fair  bimonthly is an ambiguous term  its every other month or twice a month   twice a month  then no   okay every other month  no  you cant be selfish  we all paid for it so it belongs to all of us  now get out of the way so i can sit in my time machine  i am setting the dials for march 10 1876  good choice alexander graham bell invents the telephone   and calls out for dr watson  wait a minute   id want to see that too  so when its your turn you can  but if we all go back to the same point  bells lab is going to get very crowded hell know somethings up  also since the time machine doesnt move in space  youll end up in 1876 pasadena  and even if you can make it to boston are you going knock on the door  and say to mrs bell big fan of your husband  can i come in and watch him invent the telephone  mrs bell was deaf shes not even going to hear you knock  i have a solution first go into the future   and obtain a cloaking device  how far into the future  if i remember correctly captain kirk will steal a cloaking device  from the romulans on stardate 50273  which would be january 10 2328 by prefederation reckoning  i am setting the dials for january 10 2328  here we go into the future  that was fun  my turn  okay first of all  what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide   i slipped and skinned my knee  are you okay  second of all the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked  so i had to go down the fire escape which ends on the 3d floor  forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely armenian family  who insisted i stay for lunch   that doesnt sound too bad  it was eight courses of lamb  and they tried to fix me up with their son   sorry  not done  by the time i finally got to work theyd given my shift away  thats right i lost an entire days pay thanks to this   this  time machine  the lights flash and the dish spins you want to try it  i dont want to try it  my god you are grown men  how can you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes  and comic books and now that that  again time machine  please its not a time machine if anything it looks like something  elton john would drive through the everglades  it only moves in time  it would be worse than useless in a swamp  pathetic all of you  completely pathetic  my turn  leonard its 200 in the morning  so  so its my turn  why did you set it for the day before yesterday  because i want to go back and keep myself  from getting a time machine  you cant  if you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past  you wouldnt have it available in the present to travel back  and stop yourself from buying it ergo you would still have it  this is a classic rookie timetravel mistake  can i go back and prevent you from explaing that to me  same paradox  if you were to travel back in time and say knock me unconscious  you would not then have the conversation that irritated you  motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious  what if i knocked you unconscious right now  it wont change the past  but itd make the present so much nicer  are you upset about something  what was your first clue  well it was a number of things  first the late hour  then your demeanor seems very lowenergy   plus your irritability  yes im upset  i dont usually pick up on those things  good for me  good for you  wait  did you want to talk about whats bothering you   i dont know maybe  im on fire tonight  heres the thing  girls like penny never end up with guys who own time machines  i disagree  your inability to successfully woo penny  long predates your acquisition of the time machine  that failure clearly stands on its own   thanks for pointing it out  in addition your premise is flawed  in the original film rod taylor got yvette mimieux  with that very time machine  in back to the future marty mcfly got the opportunity  to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother   those are movies  of course theyre movies  were you expecting me to come up with an example  involving a reallife time machine  thats absurd  come on guys push  if i push any harder im going to give birth to my colon   hey guys  hi penny  take a break guys   what are you doing  you know just moving a time machine  neat but i really gotta get to work  no problem  hang on  but what about your time machine  some things are more important than toys  im scared  dont worry baby ive got you  its still my turn  what are you doing  im packing up all my collectibles  and taking them down to the comic book store to sell  was that really necessary  if you need money you can always sell blood  and semen  this is not about money  we brought food  lox and bagels the breakfast of timetravelers  terrific does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine   why  i dont want it anymore   why  just personal reasons  my spidey sense tells me this has something to do with penny  look do you want to buy me out or not  ill give you 100 which will make me halfowner  and well put it on my balcony  screw his balcony ill give you 120 and well put it in my garage  i paid 200 for my share  dude everybody knows a time machine loses half its value  the minute you drive it off the lot  ill go for 200 that time machine stays right where it is  300 and ill throw in my original  with real light speed sound effects  no no more toys or action figures  or props or replicas or costumes or robots  or darth vader voice changers  im getting rid of all of it  you cant do that look what youve created here  its like nerdvana  more importantly you have a darth vader voice changer  not for long  i call dibs on the golden age flash  i need that to complete my justice society of america collection   too bad i called dibs  you cant just call dibs  i can and i did look up dibs in wikipedia  dibs doesnt apply in a bidding war  its not a bidding war  im selling it all to larry down at the comic book store   did larry call dibs  will you forget dibs  he offered me a fair price for the whole collection   whats the number ill match it  ill match it plus a thousand rupees   whats the exchange rate  none of your business  take it or leave it  mom my bar mitzvah bonds how much do i got  thanks  i can go 2600 and two trees in israel  forget it guys  if i sell to one of you the other two are going to be really mad at me  who cares as long as you pick me  okay leonard put down the box lets talk  sorry raj my mind is made up  no  i cant let you do this  get out of my way  none shall pass  i did not want to do this  but i have here the rare mint condition production error  star trek the next generation geordi la forge  without his visor in the original packaging  if you do not get out of my way  i will open it  okay man be cool  were all friends here  what the hells going on  you hypocrite  what  little miss grownups dont play with toys  if i were to go into that apartment now would i not find beanie babies  are you not an accumulator of care bears and my little ponies  and who is that japanese feline i see frolicking on your shorts  hello hello kitty  okay look if this is about yesterday leonard  i am really sorry about what i said i was just upset   i need to hear it  no you didnt you are a great guy  and it is the things you love that make you who you are  i guess that makes me large breasts  still i think its time for me to get rid of this stuff  and you know move on with my life   really  yeah  well good for you  thanks  do you want to i dont know later  excuse me   hey penny  hi mike   ready to go  i just have to change   ill give you a hand  stop it  bye guys  my turn on the time machine  it worked  it really worked  they said i was mad but it worked  not morlocks  not flesheating morlocks  help  sheldon are you okay  we have to get rid of the time machine  it is a little big for the living room isnt it  yeah thats the problem its too big  im glad you agree i hired some guys to help us move it  come on in fellas  morlocks  eat him eat him
