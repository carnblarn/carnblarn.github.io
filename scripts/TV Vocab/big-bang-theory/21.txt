                lets see raj was the kung paochicken   im the dumplings  yes you are  creepy howard  creepy good or creepy bad  who was the shrimp with lobster sauce  that would be me come to papa you unkosher delight  im not necessarily talking to the food  sit over there  sit over there  baby wipe   why do you have  no dont ask dont  ill tell you why  i had to sanitize my hands because the university  replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers  i thought the blowers were more sanitary   really dont  why  hot air blowers are incubators and spewers  of bacteria and pestilence  frankly itd be more hygienic  if they had a plagueinfested gibbon sneeze my hands dry  hey guys i just got the most amazing news  do you think youll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk  okay ill just  go eat by myself  you dont have to do that  its okay between him not talking him talking and him  im better off alone  goodbye you poor strange little man  shes so considerate  whats your news  remember that little planetary object i spotted beyond the kuiper belt  oh yeah 2008nq sub17  or as i call it planet bollywood  anyway because of my discovery people magazine is naming me  one of their 30 under 30 to watch  congratulations  thats incredible  excuse me  to watch what   to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields  if i had a million guesses i never would have gotten that  theyve got me in with a guy whos doing something about hunger in indonesia  and a psychotherapist whos using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners  and ellen page  star of the charming independent film juno  id so do her  youd do the dolphins  do i get an honorable mention for designing  the telescope camera mounting bracket you used  sorry its not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative  in which a humble boy from new delhi  overcame poverty and prejudice  and journeyed to america to reach for the stars  poverty your fathers a gynecologist  he drives a bentley  its a lease  im confused  was there some sort of peer review committee  to determine which scientists would be included  peer review its people magazine  people picked me   what people  the people from people  but exactly who are these people what are their credentials  how are they qualified  what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock  thats been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years  more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment  made by someone under 30  boy ill bet ellen pages friends arent giving her this kind of crap  are you proud of yourself  in general yes   subwayfr  theres my missing neutrino  you were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge  werent you you little subatomic dickens  hey look i found my missing neutrino  oh good we can take it off the milk carton  were going to apologize to raj and invite him out to dinner  apologize for what  he came over last night with some pretty good news  and we werent very supportive  i sense youre trying to tell me something  you were a colossal asshat  no i beg to differ  of the three of us i was by far the most supportive  really do tell  how will raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him  when i was 11  my sister bought our father a worlds greatest dad coffee mug  and frankly the man coasted until the day he died  okay lets try it this way  what if this people magazine thing is the best hes ever gonna achieve  i had not considered that  come on  i often forget other people have limitations  its so sad   he can feel sadness  not really  its what you and i would call condescension  now when we go in there lets show raj that were happy for him  but im not  well then fake it  look at me i could be grinding on the fact  that without my stabilizing telescope mount  he never would have found that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz  but im bigger than that  fine what do you want me to do  smile  crap thats terrifying  were here to see koothrappali not kill batman  try less teeth  close enough come on   hey raj  hey guys whats up  we just wanted to invite you out to dinner  to celebrate your 30 under 30 thing  right sheldon  thats very nice of you i would like that  hello boys dr gablehauser   dr koothrappali  dr gablehauser   dr hofstader  dr gablehauser   dr cooper  dr gablehauser  mr wolowitz  boys ive got a question for you who in this room  discovered a star  actually 2008nq sub17 is a planetary body  im not talking about you im talking about me  you my exotic young friend  are my star  but you didnt discover him you merely noticed he was here  much like he did with 2008nq sub17  sorry  boy weve got to get you into a better office  something more suited to your status  you dont have to go to any trouble  how about von gerlichs old office  id rather have fishbeins its bigger  wait a minute i called dibs on fishbeins office  the day he started showing up at work in his bathrobe  he gets a new office i cant even get paper towels in the mens room  damn this is hard  let me ask you something  what do you think the business of this place is   science  money  told you  and this boys picture in people magazine  is gonna raise us a pile of money taller than  well taller than you  i have a masters degree  who doesnt  have you ever had lunch in the presidents dining room  i didnt even know there was a presidents dining room  its the same food as the cafeteria only fresh   come on little buddy  okay big buddy  see you tonight guys  you can stop smiling now  so anyway after a fantastic lunch  i was whisked off to the people magazine photo shoot  have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot  its fantastic  apparently the camera loves me and i it  they shot me in front of a starry background where i posed like this  theyre going to digitally add a supernova  they say its the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent  right a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses upon itself  excuse me oh its my assistant trevor  go for koothrappali  they gave him an assistant  if i want a new pen i have to go to the bank with wire cutters  have we at this point met our social obligations  not yet  okay just put it on my calendar  but start thinking of a reason why i cant go  all righty koothrappali out  god bless that boy i dont know what id do without him  you just got him this afternoon  yes but im finding that having a lackey suits me  a lackey  im sorry is that politically incorrect  in india we just call them untouchables   now  almost  speaking of untouchables ive got great news for you guys  people magazine is having a reception this saturday  and i managed to get you invited   gee thanks  youre welcome  of course i couldnt get you into the vip section  because you know thats for vips  and you guys are just you know ps  theres a tribe in papua new guinea  where when a hunter flaunts his success  to the rest of the village they kill him  and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin  superstious nonsense of course  but one can see their point  here you go raj you might want to drink this one slowly  so saturday night can i count on my posse  gee id love to raj but i cant make it  no i could  i can make it but i wont  what are you talking about  theres a reception for my magazine article on saturday  and you guys arent going  i cant believe you raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment  and youre not even going to support him  a tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered  were plummeting toward earth and he exploded it with his mind  that would be cool id go to that reception  come on this is huge raj is gonna be in people magazine  and he didnt even have to knock up one of the spears sisters  would you like to go with me  of course i would i would be honored  really cool  shame on you guys  look at that i got a date with penny  i cant believe it took you a whole year   now  now  hey buddy  im going to be in people magazine  yeah call me when youre on the cover  raj look at you  i know im resplendent like the noonday sun am i not  yeah starting with the champagne a little early arent you  it was in the limo they sent a limo  i have a limo i just love saying limo   sip on it while youre getting ready  im ready  thats what youre wearing  why whats wrong with it  nothing i was just hoping for something a little more you know  ridonkulous  yeah well this is all the donkulous youre gonna get tonight  okeydokey lets roll  all right its time to raise the roof   hey leonard  dude  you look very nice  thank you   come on good night  good night  hey leonard do you see my limo downstairs  its bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in   terrific  it has more food too  come on come on  good news you dont have to sulk about penny anymore  there are hundreds of croatian women just waiting for you to contact them  anythingforagreencardcom  ill lend you my user name its wealthy big penis  youre joking  you gotta make it easy for em theyre just learning english  pass  so youre just gonna sit around here and mope  while penny is out with dr apu from the kwike mart  its not a date and thats racist  it cant be racist  hes a beloved character on the simpsons  lets just eat so i can get to bed  with any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnea kills me  did you ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded  even though the menu description specifies shredded  brown rice not white  did you stop at the korean grocery and get the good hot mustard  did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market   thank you  youre welcome  what took you so long   just sit down and eat  fine  all right its shredded what do you want me to do  i want you to check before you accept the order  sorry  were you distracted by the possibility that koothrappali  might have intercourse with penny tonight  hes not going to have intercourse with penny  then theres no excuse for this chicken  you know this situation with koothrappali  brings to mind a story from my childhood  oh goody more tales from the panhandle  thats northwest texas im from east texas  the gulf region home to many vietnamese shrimpers  do the shrimpers feature in your story  anyway when i was eight  a montgomery ward delivery van ran over our family cat lucky   lucky  yes lucky  hes ironyimpaired just move on  dead cat named lucky continue  while others mourned lucky  i realized his untimely demise  provided me with the opportunity to replace him  with something more suited to my pet needs  a faithful companion that i could snuggle with at night  yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command  so not a puppy  please nothing so pedestrian  i wanted a griffin  a griffin  yes half eagle half lion  and mythological  irrelevant  i was studying recombinant dna technology  and i was confidant i could create one but my parents were unwilling  to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen  of course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them  not that we dont all enjoy a good lion semen story   but whats your point  my point is  if koothrappali is moving on  to a new life of shallow undeserved fame  perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort  you want to breed a new friend  thats one option but who has the time  but consider this the japanese are doing  some wonderful work with artificial intelligence  now you combine that with some animatronics  from the imagineers over at disney  next thing you know were playing halo  with a multilingual abraham lincoln  dont take this the wrong way but youre insane  that may well be but the fact is  it wouldnt kill us to meet some new people  for the record it could kill us to meet new people  they could be murderers or the carriers of unusual pathogens  and im not insane my mother had me tested  if we do get a new friend he should be a guy you can trust   a guy who has your back  and he should have a lot of money  and live in a cool place by the beach where we could throw parties   and share our love of technology  and he should know a lot of women  lets see money women technology  okay were agreed our new friend is going to be iron man  welcome to the raj mahal  its very nice good night   wait the evenings not over  yes it is  no its time to put on some r kelly and suck face  is the evening over  wait wait wait  thats my mommy and daddy calling from india   i want you to meet my parents  wait meet them  hello mommy daddy good to see you  how are you

here you go cute huh  shes not indian  so shes not indian the boy is just sowing some wild oats  theres no sowing no squeezing and no sucking face  what if he gets her pregnant  is this little hotsytotsy who you want as the mother of your grandchildren  what right do you have to pick with whom i can have children with  look rajesh i understand youre in america  you want to try the local cuisine  trust me you dont want it for a steady diet  now you listen to me i am no longer a child  and i will not be spoken to like one  now if youll excuse me i have to go throw up   whats wrong with
