                all right thats the last servo  behold the mobile omnidirectional neutralization  and termination eradicator  or  monte  featuring one articulated razorsharp killing saw  one polycarbonate grinding and flipping wheel  steelarmor plate exoskeleton top and bottom  and enough horsepower to drive a 110 pounds of mechanized death  from zero to holy crap in 48 seconds  is it wrong to say i love our killer robot  as with my father i both love and fear it  all right enough chitchat lets destroy something  one two three  what shall be first to taste the wrath of monte  maybe we should start small  perhaps today is the day  we finally find out whats inside the magic eight ball  did it when i was four  its an icosahedral die floating in tinted blue water  man call spoiler alert before you say things like that  how about the toaster oven  what did the toaster oven ever do to you  what did i ever do to jimmy mullins in the third grade  he still punched me in the face with my own fists  sorry little nerd  you were just in the wrong boys room at the wrong time  gentlemen goggles  this is an auspicious moment  like robert oppenheimer or neil armstrong  we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event  how about die toaster die  thatll do it  all right whats next  no i think im just going to stay in tonight and do laundry   subwayfr  this door got the full monte  what the hell  killer robot we built it  yeah well it almost killed me  if it wanted to kill you youd be dead  so who exactly does it want to kill  im sorry are you unaware of the upcoming  southern california robot fighting league  round robin invitational  you know since i moved last year not all my mail has been forwarded  its a big deal  theres an awards banquet and a dance afterward  perhaps youd like to come with me  i know the other fellas would be really excited to see a girl there  how is it supposed to be a dance if im the only girl  well that may be a slight exaggeration  youd be the only doable girl  you are a pig howard  how is doable anything but a compliment   why dont we just work on the robot  please not now  once again penny and i have begun our little tango  our tango  the carnal repartee the erotic to and fro  but as delicious as the appetizer might be  at some point we will have to succumb  and eat the entre while its still   hot  im begging you stop talking  look normally i can just ignore you  i get it youre a little peculiar like sheldon  excuse me penny but in this room youre the one whos peculiar  you might be right  but back to you i know you think youre some sort  of smoothtalking ladies man but the truth is  you are just pathetic and creepy  so what are you saying  i am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable  its not sexy to stare at my ass and say  it must be jelly cause jam dont shake like that  and most important we are not dancing a tango  were not toing and froing  nothing is ever going to happen between us ever  wait a minute  this isnt flirting youre serious  flirting you think im flirting with you  i am not flirting with you no woman is ever gonna flirt with you  youre just gonna grow old and die alone  thanks for the heads up  where you going  im going home to live my creepy pathetic life  someone had to say it  what  he said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition  howard the phone is ringing  heres a crazy idea ma answer it  all right hold on  its your friend leonard  he wants to know why youre not at school today  i dont go to school ma  i work at a university  thats a school now pick up the phone  i dont want to talk to anybody  should i ask leonard to bring over your homework  i dont have homework  im a grown man with a masters degree in engineering  excuse me mr fancypants  want me to get you a popsicle  cherry please  i ate the cherry all thats left is green  you make me want to kill myself   whats going on  i dont know  now theyre just yelling about popsicles   sounds like penny really got to him  im not surprised  despite his hard and crusty shell howard is a very sensitive man  do you know he writes poetry  mostly about men from nantucket and hermits named dave  but he does it with real sensitivity  hey hofstadter  word around the pwasma wab is you built a wobot   yes we did kripke  his name is monte  well if you have any dewusions about entering him  against my wobot the kwipke kwippler  in the southern california robot fighting league  wound wobin invitational aka the scrflrri  his name is gonna be scwap metal  come on is that really necessary  leonard i believe it is  this is trash talk  and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events  kripke  your robot is inferior  and it will be defeated by ours  because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution  also im given to understand that your mother is overweight  oh snap  of course if that is the result of a glandular condition  and not sloth and gluttony i withdraw that comment  what difference does it make fat is fat  there are boundaries  tell you what forget the scrflrri  wets settle this woboto a woboto  what do you mean  theres no guarantee were gonna go against each other  in the wound wobin so lets throw down  you know  unless youre afwaid  we accept your challenge name a time and place   tomorrow 300 the kinetics wab  make it so  no dont make it so  barry we cant fight you tomorrow our engineer is incapacitated  whats wrong with him  hes depressed because hes pathetic and creepy and cant get girls  were all pathetic and cweepy and cant get girls  thats why we fight wobots  if youre not there youll be exposed to widicule  im curious what part of america is that accent from   you got a minute  yeah come on in  whats up   i need you to apologize to how  get out  come on he wont come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle  well then have the robot go and get him  the robot didnt hurt his feelings  his feelings needed to be hurt  hes been in bed for two days  probably with a blowup doll  hes not with a  does it really matter who or what hes with  the guy is devastated  please how could i possibly devastate howard  okay dont take this as a criticism but you kind of have  that overexposedtogammarays thing going on  what does that mean  you know like most of the time youre the easygoing bruce banner  but then when you get angry you kind of turn into like you know  i turn into a bear  seriously gamma rays bruce banner you didnt get the incredible hulk  never mind just please go talk to him  and say what  that i didnt mean it because i meant it  maybe you can go at it from a different angle  like you see a glimmer of goodness in him  and you only said what you said because you want to  nurture it and make it shine  okay lets try it this way  remember the day we met and you asked me  to go to your boyfriends apartment to get your tv back  and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said  what was that what did you say  oh yes you said you owed me one  okay come on thats not fair  i came home with no pants  fine ill go over there tomorrow  thank you  i should probably give you a heads up about his mother  what about her  shes a delightful woman youll love her  howard theres a blonde girl patsy here to see you  who  okay now shes saying its penny  i dont wanna talk to her  ma  she ran past me  was i supposed to tackle her  so i just came by to see how you were doing  im fine  good  your mom seems nice  people move away from her on the bus  what do you want  i just want to apologize  for some things that i have said  about you  ive been informed that you have feelings  and apparently i have hurt them  so im sorry  fine youre sorry goodbye  so youre okay  hey im a big boy  im not traumatized by some random comment  from some random woman  i mean get over yourself  bye  so close  oh my god thats kripkes robot  as you can see the kwippler is weducing the chevy cavawier to wubble  i cant watch anymore  sheldon we have to call it off  we dont have that option  weve accepted the challenge we cant run away from a fight  please weve spent our whole lives running away from fights  personally i can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size  impressive as that may be monte is not us  monte has no fear  didnt we watch the same video  kripkes robot just had angry sex with a midsized automobile  you are overlooking the fact we know what were up against  and we can modify monte so that hes prepared  you wanna prepare him  install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself  excuse me but how are we gonna make any modifications without wolowitz   have you heard from penny  not yet  have faith gentlemen we dont need wolowitz  engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics  watch and learn  do either of you know how to open the toolbox  and then when i was 14  i met marcy grossman  she was so beautiful  she just got her braces off  but they left a little of the overbite  it was so hot  like a sexy little chipmunk  i didnt have the courage  to ask her out  but i dedicated a song to her  at the ninth grade talent show  that sounds sweet  marcy grossman is sunshine  on a cloudy day  when its cold outside  marcy grossman is the month of may  its cute  i guess  youd say  what can make me feel this way  marcy grossman marcy grossman marcy grossman  talkin bout marcy  thats great   grossman  its fun  and then she came up with that sexy little chipmunk mouth  and spit in my hair  which brings us to tenth grade  do you think maybe sometimes  you try too hard  look at me  what chance do i have if i dont try too hard  youd have a terrific chance  i mean youre smart youre funny you have a cool job  you build stuff that goes into outer space  i guess  im telling you ive known you for a year and a half  and this is the first time i feel like im talking  to a real person  and you know what i like him  hes a nice guy  you really think so  i dont know  i do  nice little bot youve got here  im aware  whats this do spin  yep at 3400 rpm  it can cut through steel like it was wubber  neat  good work  sheldon weve gotta call this off  no leonard  for years merciless thugs like kripke  have made my life a series of painful noogies  and humiliating wedgies  and the insensitively named indian burns  that stops now  but we dont have a chance  the only improvement you were able to make  was to put fresh batteries in the remote  what you fail to realize is kripke suffers from a fatal flaw  overconfidence from his robots massive size  and its overwhelming power  thats not overconfidence thats observation  trust me kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare  observe  i would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker  but as you are its maker clearly the two of you have met  what is his pwoblem  way to bust out the jedi mind tricks dude  i just wanna make sure were all clear  standard robotic fighting league rules apply  are you cwazy  this is a stweet fight the stweet has no rules  hes right leonard the paradigm is to the death  i will however  give you the opportunity to concede my superiority now  and offer me your robot as the spoils of war  never  id rather see monte dead than in your hands  that could be easily arranged  ready set go   do it  all right then  weady set go   come on sheldon you got this  indeed  we are prepared for anything he can throw at us  thats new  run monte run  run monte  go go go go  dont hurt us dont hurt us dont hurt us  well so much for making up  for the emotional wounds of childhood  i did this  monte was killed by my hubris and my pride  no matter what anybody says this is my fault  no ones arguing with you dude  i got your text how bad is  forget the robot what happened to you   he slipped and fell  yes  i slipped and fell  in the bathroom  bounced right off the tub  now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing  when you dont treat them with respect  they sucker punch you when your eyes are closed  so what do you think howard  its not that bad right  a little electrical tape some solder  are you insane  ive seen space probes that crashed into the desert  that were in better shape than this  youre right  montes gone  well bury him in the morning a simple ceremony ill speak  leonard youll play your cello  honey arent you getting a little carried away  i mean its just a toy robot  just a toy robot  i know i got it  sheldon im sorry  dont get the wrong idea  the way i see it im halfway to pity sex
