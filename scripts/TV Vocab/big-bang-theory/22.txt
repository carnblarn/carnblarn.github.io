                good morning  were gonna have to stop by pottery barn on the way to work  i bought these star wars sheets but  they turned out to be much too stimulating  to be compatible with a good nights sleep  i dont like the way darth vader stares at me  im not going to work  just because your careers been stagnant for a few years  thats no reason to give up  i was up all night using the new freeelectron laser  for my xray diffraction experiment  did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas  no  then you can drive lets go  ddnt i tell you id be working nights and that  youd have to make other arrangements   you did  and  i didnt  lets go  good night   but how am i going to get to work  take the bus  i cant take the bus anymore they dont have seat belts  and they wont let you latch yourself to the seat with bungee cords  you tried to latch yourself to the seat with bungee cords  i didnt try i succeeded  but for some reason it alarmed the other passengers  and i was asked to debus  youre a big boy youll figure it out  dont talk to me like im a child  now take me to return my star wars sheets  what is it  leonards asleep  thanks for the update  no wait  you have to drive me to work  yeah i really dont think i do  but i dont drive and i cant take the bus  youll be fine as long as you dont do that bungee cord thing okay  didnt you recently state that you and i are friends  yes sheldon we are friends  then i hereby invoke what im given to understand  is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship  the favor  oh dear god  im sorry i didnt realize i was interrupting your morning prayers  when youre done well go   subwayfr  thank you for driving me to work  you know this is my day off  oh good im not keeping you from anything  your check engine light is on  typically thats an indicator to you know check your engine  its fine its been on for like a month  actually that would be all the more reason to  you know check your engine  sheldon its fine  if it were fine the light wouldnt be on  thats why the manufacturer installed that light to let you know its not fine  maybe the lights broken  is there a check the check engine light light  what  studies have shown that performing tasks  such as eating talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving  reduces ones reaction time  by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol  do you have any alcohol   of course not  too bad  youre going up euclid avenue  leonard takes los robles avenue  good for leonard  euclid avenue is shorter as the crow flies  but it has speed bumps which appreciably increase  pointtopoint drive time making it the less efficient choice  but you have the conn  if youre not going to slow down for the speed bumps  i withdraw my previous objection  heres a fun question  do you know what the most common street name is   no  the answers tricky  its second street  youd think it would be first street but in most towns  first street eventually gets renamed to something else  you know like main street  broad street  michigan avenue  leonard and i often use our commute time  to exercise our minds with brainteasers like that  we also play games   would you like to play one  no  come on its fun  another bump  okay ill say an element and you say an element  whose name starts with the last letter of the one i said okay  ill start  helium  now you could say mercury  that would give me a y very clever thats a tough one  so i go with ytterbium which gets you back to m  so you go molybdenum and i say magnesium  you say manganese i say europium  and then youre left with mendelevium  and there are no more ms  because i believe that meitnerium should still be called ekairidium  so congratulations you win  do you wanna go again  why dont we just have a little quiet time now  all right  im sorry im finding your reckless nonchalance  regarding the checkengine light to be very troubling  get out  i have to tell you that while i do have a theoretical understanding  of the workings of an internal combustion engine  im not sure im capable of performing diagnostics  i said get out  okay ill give it a shot  there you are im ready to go home   i just got here  good perfect timing  i told you i only have access to the freeelectron laser at night  i cant drive you for the next few weeks  no you said you couldnt drive me to work  this is from work  howard help me out here  no just for the fun of it im gonna take his side  now how do you propose i get home  how did you get here in the first place  penny  but i sense thats no longer an option  i need to get to the laser lab  youre just gonna have to find someone else to take you home  damn i picked the wrong side  god not euclid avenue  why did howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway   we had a difference of opinion  over what  whether or not he was trying to kill me  for the record i maintain he was  where are you going im taking you home  but im not going home its wednesday  wednesdays new comic book day we have to go to the comic book store  then we have to stop at souplantation  its creamy tomato soup day  and radio shack theres a sale on triplea batteries  plus we have to go to pottery barn and return my star wars sheets  i have a better idea  you want to go to pottery barn first  can you drive me to pottery barn  maybe if i turn off the nightlight i can keep the sheets  good morning  good morning  sheldon sit down  shes in my spot  dont look at me like that everybody knows thats my spot  you know that we care about you  and its because we care about you that weve decided we have to speak up  youre hurting the people around you sweetie  so we made you an appointment and we want you to keep it  department of motor vehicles new driver handbook  but i dont have a problem  sheldon you need to learn how to drive  this madness has to stop  pennys taking you to the dmv im going to bed   why penny  because rock breaks scissors  good night   all right come on sheldon  hold on   i have one condition  what  we have to stop at pottery barn  and radio shack  fine   and the comic book store  all right  i want to go to the comic book store  i like comic books  i still dont see why i need a drivers license  albert einstein never had a drivers license  yeah but albert einstein didnt make me wet myself  at 40 miles an hour  yeah and i never wanted to kick albert einstein in the nuts  i gotta ask why didnt you just get a license at 16 like everybody else  i was otherwise engaged  doing what  examing perturbative amplitudes in n4 supersymmetric theories  leading to a reexamination of the ultraviolet properties  of multiloop n8 supergravity using modern twistor theory  well how about when you were 17  take this to the testing area put your name at the top  sign the bottom answer the questions bring it back next  application  im actually more of a theorist  the application in your hand  give it to her  take this to the testing area put your name at the top  sign the bottom answer the questions bring it back next  excuse me but i have some concerns about these questions  look at that sign up there  does it say i give a damn  thats because i dont  just look this first question makes no sense  how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving  theres no possible way to answer that  a car length is not a standardized unit of measure  look at the sign   its c just put down c  i dont need your help penny  listen to that little girl honey put c next  wait hang on   look at this next question  why are you arguing with the dmv  how else are they going to learn  look question two  when are roadways most slippery  now there are 3 answers none of which are correct  the correct answer is when covered by a film of liquid  sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction  between the tire and the road to essentially zero  but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction  heres your learners permit go away  but im not done  i have many additional concerns about these questions   dont make me climb over this counter  come on  next  aced it  thats it lets boot it up  booting  this is a stateoftheart simulator  i adapted it from something a friend of mine designed for the army  is that why i appear to be in downtown fallujah  behind the wheel of an uparmored humvee  i havent configured it yet  lets see  bradley tank  transport truck batmobile  here we go red 2006 ford taurus  on the streets of pasadena  what  statistically red cars are stopped by police  far more often than any other color  i dont want any hassles with the fuzz  fine what color do you want  you know the pale blue of luke skywalkers lightsaber  before it was digitally remastered  black it is  okay now what you want to do first is turn on the ignition  and shift into drive  i havent fastened my seat belt yet  okay fasten your seat belt   now are there air bags  you dont need air bags  what if a simulated van rearends me  ill hit you in the face with a pillow  okay now shift into drive  pull out slowly into traffic  watch out watch watch out for the pedestrians  wait slow hit the brakes the brakes  thank you  sorry excuse me  my bad  student driver  how did you manage to get on the 2d floor  of the glendale galleria  i dont know  i was on the pasadena freeway i missed my exit  flew off the overpass and one thing led to another  maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow  i quit  the pet store  remind me to compliment wolowitz on the software  its amazingly detailed  so wait youre just gonna give up  no im not giving up  i never give up  so what is it youre doing  im  transcending the situation  im clearly  too evolved for driving  what does that mean  have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors  are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size  i wonder a lot of things about you but notnot that  well those are indicators  that im farther along the evolutionary scale   than the average human  no kidding  hold on  im not gonna go so far as to say  that i represent a distinct new stage in humankind  you know a homo novus if you will  thats for anthropologists to decide  but i am convinced  that the reason i cannot master the plebeian task of driving  is because im not meant to  yes you are youre meant to learn how to drive  please learn how to drive  im meant for greater things  like unraveling the mysteries of the universe  not determing when its safe  to pass a stopped school bus on a country road   its never safe  yeah well i know that now  fine  assuming that everything you say is true  how does the biologically superior homo novus get to work tomorrow morning  homo novus doesnt know  well hang in there  maybe youll evolve into something with wings  good morning gentlemen  good morning  is there some new kind of casual friday i dont know about  no he lives here now  really why  since he wont take the bus and hes too evolved to drive  he decided it would be easier to sleep in his office  and shower in the radiation lab  until im finished with my experiment  but you finished your experiment a week ago  you saw nothing
