answer  out of coffee need coffee  hi stephanie right  andand you are  penny i live across the hall   ive heard a lot about you  really  i havent heard a thing about you  why havent i heard a thing

i never slept with her i swear  in leonards defense it wasnt for lack of trying   thank you  youre welcome  look im just saying  penny is one of our many neighbors  and in our building neighbors come and go  its very casual no dress code  in fact some mornings ill just mosey down to the third floor  in my pajamas and have cereal with mrs vartabedian  really  i have never once been invited to have cereal with mrs vartabedian  she doesnt like you  you have a gall bladder to remove  and i have to get in the shower and penny has clothes to put on so   it was very nice meeting you  nice to finally

what was your first clue  new pants  yeah stephanie got them for me  nice cotton  actually i think its more of a wool fire ant blend  so the girlfriends buying clothes for you sounds serious  it is actually  in fact i gave it a lot of thought  and i decided it was time for us to live together  leonard huge mistake  theres a whole buffet of women out there  and youre just standing in the corner  eating the same deviled egg over and over again  at least i have an egg what do you have  a veritable smorgasbord of potential sexual partners  see the blonde over there  i can hit on her and you cant  so go hit on her  shes not my type  too bad cause she was checking you out before   she was  of course not look at her  i dont care what you guys think  stephanie and i are very happy living together  i will give either of you 20 dollars right now to trade pants with me  what are you doing here  hang on   its a little high  we can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk  where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff  my aunt marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday  she thought if i failed at theoretical physics  that i should have a trade to fall back on  and by the way the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer  thank you  didnt they teach you that in medical school   im busy here sheldon  i understand  all i need is for you to authorize these tests  a cardiac stress test a full body mri an electromyogram  a cbc baseline glucose upper gi  and an exploratory laparoscopy  last time i had hiccups it felt like my diaphragm  was just going through the motions  go home  can i at least have the upper gi  i already drank the barium  good do you have any fabric softener  yeah sure  what are you washing a crocodile  no the pants that stephanie got me  sweetie you cant machine wash these theyll be ruined   are you sure  absolutely  i wish youd told me that sooner   are you guys having problems  no everythings fine  really  yeah its wonderful  maybe this whole living together  happened kind of suddenly but its fine its great  you know if youre uncomfortable with the way things are going  youre allowed to say something  are you sure that doesnt sound right  believe me your feelings are just as important as hers  no that doesnt sound right either  just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace  that you both are comfortable with  yeah i could say something like that to her  ill go do that  thank you  sure  you have a really good grasp on this  maybe you could talk to her  youre kidding right  no but thats okay  ill go talk to her  want to come with  go  what  you were right your larynx is terribly inflamed  ive never seen anything like it  i knew it  what do i do  youre going to need to stop talking immediately  for how long  immediately  whats going on  i just performed a sheldonectomy  careful if you dont get it all itll only come back worse  gotcha  we need to talk  do we need to talk or do we need to talk  i dont know what that means  why dont you just tell me what it is you have to tell me  look its just that  things between you and me have been going pretty quick  and  its just a little scary  well yeah but scary good right  sure  when is scary not good  but  i have feelings right  okay and its perfectly okay to express those feelings right  of course honey why dont you tell me what it is youre feeling  okay well i think its important to remember  that we move at a pace  that is our speed and  oh shoot i had it  how about this how about i tell you what im feeling  whats that  really right now  why not  i just ate arent you supposed to wait an hour  i think thats for swimming  i just hope i dont get cramps   i put your clothes in the dryer  thank you   your pants are ruined  good  so how did the talk with stephanie go  on one level really  really well  so you told her you wanted to slow things down  not specifically  but i did tell her that i had feelings  good good  and then what  and then  the subject got changed somehow  you had sex didnt you  little bit  what  nothing  okay well it sounds like things are going to work out  its all good  everythings going to work out one way or another  god come on leonard  you are entitled to try and make things go the way you want them to   really  yes  you dont always have to go along with what the woman wants  what  nothing just rethinking my whole life  heres the thing  im afraid that if i ask her to move out  shell just dump me  its a chance you have to take  i mean look if its meant to be itll be  very comforting  what do i say to her  i dont know what have women said to you  when they wanted to slow a relationship down  i really like you but i want to see how things go with mark  yeah thatll slow it down  im sorry i totally interrupted you what were you saying  right yeah  heres the thing  i really like you  god here comes the speech  what speech  i really like you  but maybe we should spend a little less time together  cause i need my space  but ill call you on tuesday  and then you never call me so i call you  but you dont call me back and then when i run into you  at the coffee shop you pretend like youve been having problems  with your voice mail and i know that youre lying  but i pretend like i dont care  even though im dying inside  i wasnt going to say any of that  i was just going to say  i really like you  oh good  cause i really like you too  terrific  nice sweater  stephanie got it for me its kind of fun  its got a big bird on it dude  yeah yeah thats the fun part  were also getting new curtains for my bedroom  and a dust ruffle and a duvet and i dont even know what a duvet is  but im pretty sure if i did i wouldnt want one  but every time i talk to her about moving out  she cries and we have sex  youre lucky with me its usually the other way around  you know if you cant talk to her why dont you just text her   isnt that kind of cowardly  yeah its beyond contemptible  true  but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater  sold  i think it would be better for our relationship  if you moved back to your place  there   its done  good for you  good for me  ill never have sex again  i was wrong see ya  i have an inflamed larynx  we are out of herbal tea  do you have any  okay let me check  some hiney would be nice too  hiney  honey
