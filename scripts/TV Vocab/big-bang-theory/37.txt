                problem   this is thai food  here we go  we dont have thai food on thursday we have pizza on thursday  yes but we all agreed that the third thursday  of every month would be anything can happen thursday  apparently the news didnt reach my digestive system  which when startled has its own version  of anything can happen thursday  come on the whole idea behind anything can happen thursday  is to get out of this rut weve been in lately  rut i think you mean consistency  and if were going to abandon that then why even call it thursday  lets call it quonko day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece  and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god ra  i could go for some goat  sheldon we agreed wed do something different tonight  all right lets go to the comic book store  we went there last night  last night was wednesday wednesday is comic book night  tonight well be going on thursday  because its anything can happen thursday  way to think outside but pressed right up against the box  so what are we going to do tonight  if i may proffer a suggestion  in bars all across this great nation of ours  thursday night is ladies night  which means as the evening progresses  we will get better looking courtesy of 99 cent margaritas  and twoforone jello shots  come on howard the odds of us  picking up girls in a bar are practically zero  really are you familiar with the drake equation  the one that estimates the odds of making contact  with extraterrestrials by calculating the product  of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values  such as those stars with planets  and those planets likely to develop life  n equals r times fp times ne times fl  times fi times fc times l  yeah that one  you can modify it to calculate our chances  of having sex by changing the formula to use the number  of single women in los angeles  the number of those who might find us attractive  and what i call the wolowitz coefficient  the wolowitz coefficient  neediness times dress size squared  crunching the numbers i come up with a conservative  within a 40mile radius  youre joking  im a horny engineer leonard  i never joke about math or sex  what are we waiting for lets bounce bitches  youre right  its anything can happen thursday lets hit the clubs and meet hot women  here we go lock up your daughters  were going to hit it and quit it  or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store  also a good plan  but next anything can happen thursday were definitely going to a bar  absolutely  you heard that ladies night ladies were eventually coming for you  fascinating   the fw team   hey guys wherere you headed  to the comic book store  youre probably thinking the comic book store on a thursday  why ive fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness  what you have failed to take into account  is that this is anything can happen thursday  you got me  while youre there could pick me up a few comics for my nephews birthday  i think you mean comic books  comics are feeble attempts at humor featuring talking babies  and anthropomorphized pets  found traditionally in the optimisticallynamed funny pages  could you pick me up a few comics for my nephews birthday  sure what does he like  i dont know hes 13 just pick out anything  just pick out anything  maybe we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size  or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude  or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fiber requirements  or his feelings about little marshmallows   spiderman get

excuse me  hello again  hi what would you recommend as a present for a 13yearold boy  a 13yearold girl  but if youre dead set on a comic book try  this  hellblazer whats this about  a morally ambiguous confidence man  who smokes has lung cancer  and is tormented by the spirits of the undead  if it doesnt make me the favorite aunt i dont know what will  is this me  depends do you like it   its really good  yes thats you  thats so sweet but what if i didnt like it  itd still be you but id feel like an idiot  i dont believe it stuarts putting the moves on penny  i have got to learn how to

my number   now give me the picture  you drive a hard bargain  but here  all right so just give me a call  so leonard how are you enjoying anything can happen thursday  look at that thats a dent  thank you howard hamfisted wolowitz  did you just shut the tv off in the middle of the classic  deep space ninestar trek the original series  trouble with tribbles crossover episode  apparently so  are you ill  all right  then is it fair to say that youre experiencing  some sort of emotional turmoil over the events  involving penny earlier this evening  when did you pick up on that  a moment ago when you turned off the tv during the classic  deep space ninestar trek the original series  trouble with tribbles crossover episode  would you like some advice  sure why not  then this is the perfect time to launch a blog  with an interactive comments section  thanks a lot  would you rather i offer my personal insight  i dont need any insights  i just want to know why pennys more interested in stuart than me  were practically the same guy  i disagree  stuart is taller artistic selfemployed  and most significantly he gets 45 percent off comic books  youre right i really should be asking strangers on the internet  my original point  chinese food vintage video games  after the nightmare of anything can happen thursday  this is friday night the way it was meant to be  whos up for sheldonfree saturday  hey penny and stuart   hey guys  so what are you kids up to  stuart has a piece in an art show thats opening tonight  and you guys are going together great  it is great  really

classic 1980 interactive text adventure zork  its the buggy beta version  zork well you guys have fun   see you guys  see you stuart  hey howard  take me to a bar with women   really  yeah  let me

 why  im not sitting here with a guy  drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella  fine ill have a chocolate martini  wrong again  you know i cant talk to women  unless im lit up like the hindu festival of devali  there are plenty of bars in los angeles  where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis  but you wouldnt have to because there are no women in them  gotcha  ill have a brandy alexander  all right the three musketeers just became the dynamic duo  should we talk to some of these women  its way too early in the night for that  first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd and then  we go after the weak and the old and the lame  thats your system  thats my system  and if you spot a chick with a seeing eye dog shes mine  come on i think its nice  that captain sweatpants showed up to your art opening  yeah it would have been nicer if he hadnt touched all the cheese  you know its kind of early  do you want to maybe come in for some coffee  gee its a little late for coffee isnt it  you think coffee means coffee that is so sweet  come on i think i have decaf  good stuart  i thought i heard your voice do you have a moment   yeah i guess  sheldon were a little busy so   what are you doing  were having coffee  isnt it a little late for coffee  its okay she thinks she has decaf  ill just go look for it   whats up  ive spent the last three hours  in an online debate in the dc comics batman chatroom   and i need your help  yeah those guys can be very stubborn   whats the topic  i am asserting  in the event that batmans death proves permanent  the original robin dick grayson  is the logical successor to the bat cowl  sheldon im afraid you couldnt be more wrong  more wrong  wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation  of course it is its a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable  its very wrong to say its a suspension bridge  but returning to the original issue dick grayson became nightwing  a superhero in his own right  batman 2 has to be the second robin jason todd  has to be has to be  i hope youre being deliberately provocative   i found the decaf  great  herbal tea for me please  barkeep  alexander me  how about those two  theyre eating peanuts  and my allergies one kiss would put me in cedarssinai for a week  what about the ones in the corner  possible very possible  you want the one in the whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking  i think blinkys cute  you got it sir  wait so we just go over there  we have a little prep work to do  put this in your mouth we walk past them you stumble a bit  i say sorry my friends had a little too much  and then i start to pull it out of your mouth  and say a little too much fun  get it  theyre laughing were laughing  then we get them up to about a 15 blood alcohol level  and tell them were millionaires  what else you got  depends are you willing to sit on my lap  and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy  i cant sit on your lap you dont know the routine  im sorry but youre obviously stuck in a prezero hour dc universe  of course i am  removing joe chill as the killer of batmans parents  effectively deprived him of his raison dtre  throw all the french around you want it doesnt make you right  au contraire  plus youre forgetting that the infinite crisis storyline  restored joe chill to the batman mythology  i am forgetting nothing and i resent your tone  look sheldon its late ive got to get some sleep   so i win  no im tired  so i win   fine you win  darn tootin i win  penny i really had a terrific time  no dont wake her  shell maul you like a rabid wolverine  you know i dont think that was decaf  wait is this your card or isnt it  trust me this was their card  i thought you were good at this  youre always talking about how you go to bars and meet women  i do all the time  well what happened weve been sitting here all night  and the longest conversation youve had with a woman was when your mom called  youre just going to make me come out and say it  say what  youre weighing me down  im a falcon who hunts better solo  fine ill sit here you take flight and hunt  dont be ridiculous you cant tell a falcon when to hunt  actually you
