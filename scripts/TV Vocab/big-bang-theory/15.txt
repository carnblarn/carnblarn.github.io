                on the other hand some physicists are concerned  that if this supercollider actually works  itll create a black hole and swallow up the earth  ending life as we know it  what a bunch of crybabies  no guts no glory man  hey check it out  the school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers  we are testing a new medication for social anxiety  panic attacks agoraphobia and obsessive

shes funny  but frankly ive never been able to see it  thats because you have no measurable sense of humor shelly  how exactly would one measure a sense of humor  a humormometer  i think youre delightfully droll  or as the french say trs drle  so let me see if i got this  leonard howard and  im sorry what was your name again  rajesh  season 1 episode 15 the pork chop indeterminacy  so missy

papers for shelly to sign for my dads estate  the papers couldve been mailed mom sent you to spy on me didnt she  i guess thats why they call you a genius  they call me a genius because im a genius  tell mom that i currently weigh 165 pounds  and that im having regular bowel movements  enjoy the wedding goodbye  if the weddings not until tomorrow why dont you stay with us tonight  i dont think so shelly doesnt like company  even as a little boy hed send his imaginary friends home  at the end of the day  they were not friends they were imaginary colleagues  look youre here we have plenty of room  no we dont  come on shelly shes family  so what i dont issue invitations to your mother  it would be nice not to have to drive to anaheim in rush hour  and dont ever call me shelly  so its settled youll stay with us  yeah ill walk you to your car youre in structure 3 level c right  what just happened  so anyway were eight years old  and sheldon converts my easy bake oven  to some kind of highpowered furnace  just classic  i needed a place to fire ceramic semiconductor substrates  for homemade integrated circuits  he was trying to build some sort of armed robot  to keep me out of his room  made necessary by her insistence on going into my room  anyway i go to make those little corn muffins they give you  theres a big flash next thing you know my eyebrows are gone  not your eyebrows  yep i had to go through the entire second grade  with crooked eyebrows my mom drew on  is that what that was  i just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical  you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs  those are not mine  really they have your little name label in them  yeah no i do i use those  just to polish up my spearfishing equipment  i spearfish  when im not crossbow hunting i spearfish  this is sheldons twin sister missy  this is our neighbor penny   you dont look that much alike  can i get a hallelujah  fraternal twins come from two separate eggs  they are no more alike than any other siblings  hey guess what ive been accepted  as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness   good for you raj  yes im very hopeful hello missy  they mentioned there may be side effects  so missy  have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of india  well theres dr patel at our church  yes patel good man  do you like motorcycles cause i ride a hog  a hog you have a twocylinder scooter with a basket in the front  you still have to wear a helmet  have you ever heard of the kama sutra   the sex book  the indian sex book  in other words if you wonder wonder  who wrote the book of love it was us   sheldons sister is pretty cute huh  i wasnt staring  i didnt say you were i just said she was cute  maybe  if you like women who are tall  and perfect  sheldon why are you ignoring your sister  im not ignoring my sister im ignoring all of you  i brought snacks  oh my gherkins and  onion dip its onion dip  we dont entertain much  missy do you enjoy pajamas   i guess  we indians invented them  youre welcome  yeah well my people invented circumcision  youre welcome  missy im gonna go get my nails done do you want to come  god yes thanks  youre welcome   bye guys  bye missy see you   goodbye leonard  oh yeah no bye penny  you two have to back off  why should i back off you back off dude  excuse me this is my apartment and shes my roommates sister   so what youve already got penny  how do i have penny  in what universe do i have penny   so i can have penny  hell no  excuse me can i interject something  im ordering pizza online is everyone okay with pepperoni   sheldon can i talk to you in private  i guess  dont worry i was going to order you cheeseless   thank you  its okay  lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about  im a fancy indian man we invented pajamas  hey look at me i dont have a foreskin  are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman  she certainly has the symmetry and low body fat  that western culture deems desirable  its noteworthy at other points in history  heavier women were the standard for beauty  because their girth suggested affluence  thats fascinating  i didnt say it was fascinating i said it was noteworthy  all right noted  but my point is that koothrappali and wolowitz  theyre hitting on your sister  okay  you know i dont want to criticize your rhetorical style  but wed be a lot further along in this conversation  if youd begun with that thought   great  im saying  we took quite an unnecessary detour from what i now understand to be your thesis  whatever  you have to do something about it   why  because shes your sister  i dont understand  yes we shared a uterus for nine months  but since then weve pretty much gone our own separate ways  okay consider this  with your father gone  it is your responsibility  to make sure that missy chooses a suitable mate  i hadnt considered that  we do share dna  so there is the possibility however remote  that resting in her loins  is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself  exactly  and you owe it to yourself and to posterity  to protect the genetic integrity of your sisters future offspring  youre right  if someone wants to get at missys fallopian tubes  theyll have to go through me  i am shiva the destroyer  i will have the woman  im warning you i was judo champion at math camp  all right now thats enough juvenile squabbling  you stop it stop it i say  im going to settle this right now  neither of you are good enough for my sister  who are you to decide that  hes the man of his family you have to respect his wishes   youre out too by the way  say what  its nothing personal id just prefer  if my future niece or nephew didnt become flatulent  every time they ate an eskimo pie  what are you so happy about  im not happy  its the medication i cant stop smiling  now that leonards made me aware how high the genetic stakes are  we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister  wait a minute leonard made you aware of that  we all make mistakes lets move on  excuse me i think youre missing a big opportunity here  how so  everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring  why not put a little mocha in the family latte  in principle you have a point  but as a practical matter need i remind you  that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals  to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex  i think youre focusing entirely too much on the drugs  is it cause im jewish  cause id kill my rabbi with a pork chop to be with your sister  this has nothing to do with religion  this has to do with the fact that youre a tiny tiny man  who still lives with his mother  sheldon you are really being unreasonable  am i  here eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister  oh really  shelly can i speak to you for a minute  alone  why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone  usually nobody wants to be alone with me  we all make mistakes lets move on  im not even going to ask why youre pimping me out for cheese  but since when do you care at all about who i sleep with  truthfully ive never given it any thought  but it has been pointed out to me that you carry dna of great potential   what on earth are you talking about  let me explain  you see im a superior genetic mutation  an improvement on the existing mediocre stock  and what do you mean mediocre stock  that would be you  but residing within you is the potential for another me  perhaps even taller smarter and less prone to freckling  a sheldon 20 if you will  sheldon 20  exactly  now i am not saying that i should be the sole decider of who you mate with  if youre not attracted to the suitor  the likelihood of conception will be reduced   you have got to be kidding me  not at all  frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertilization  okay shelly sit down  now ive lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin brother is  as mom puts it  one of gods special little people  i always thought i was more like a cuckoo bird  you know a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds  of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food  leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death  luckily for you thats where the metaphor ended  i thought it ended at cuckoo  you listen to me  if you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me  then terrific bring it on  but you try one time to tell me who i should be sleeping with  and you and i are going to go round and round  the way we did when we were little remember   i have an alternate proposal  go on  you donate eggs  we will place them in cryogenic storage  i will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs  have them fertilized and implanted in you  that way everybody wins  correction  missy can date whoever she wants  look we have to settle this  i agree  sheldons sister is hiding at pennys because weve all been hitting on her   at the same time  shes not hiding  she needed privacy to call her grandmother whos apparently very sick  and then i believe she has to wash her hair  you poor deluded bastard   dont start with me  you want to go again lets go  sit down  if were going to fight over missy lets do it the right way  the honorable way  take that  you want some more  and hes down  one two three  come on get up  stay down bitch  nine ten  natural selection at work  i weep for humanity  excuse me while i go tell missy the good news   leonard  hi penny hows it going  that guy mike that you were dating is that still going on  pretty much why  nothing just catching up by the way may i speak to missy please  of course   hi leonard whats up  since youre leaving tomorrow  i was wondering if youd like to go to dinner with me  thats so sweet but no thanks   do you have other plans or  no  all right   enjoy the rest of your evening  thanks see ya  heres something we didnt anticipate  what do you want howard  im fine thanks for asking  ive come to call on missy   hi howard  the amazing howard   do you like magic  not really no  then you are in for a treat  behold an ordinary cane  thank you i apprec  apprec  appree  oh honey is your medication wearing off  well hi cutie pie  i was hoping youd show up  we had a dog who made a noise like that  had to put him down  any news you want me to pass on to mom  well she might be interested to know that i have refocused my research  from bosonic string theory to heterotic string theory  ill just tell her you say hey  well it was pleasant seeing you  other than that business with my testicles  come on shelly  i want you to know im very proud of you  really  yep im always bragging to my friends about my brother the rocket scientist  you tell people im a rocket scientist  well yeah  im a theoretical physicist   whats the difference  whats the difference  good bye shelly  my god  why dont you just tell them that im a tolltaker at the golden gate bridge  rocket scientist how humiliating
