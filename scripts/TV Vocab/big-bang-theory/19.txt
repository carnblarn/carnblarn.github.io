                worst renaissance fair ever  please let it go sheldon  it was rife with historical inaccuracies  for example the tavern girl serving flagons of mead  her costume was obviously germanic  but in 1487  the bavarian purity laws or reinheitsgebot  severely limited the availability of mead  at best they would have had some sort of spiced wine   youre nitpicking  oh really  well heres another nit for you the flagons  would not have been made of polypropylene  renaissance fairs arent about historical accuracy  theyre about taking chubby girls who work at kinkos  and lacing them up in corsets so tight  their bosom jumps out and says howdy  bosoms would not have said howdy in the 15th century  if anything they wouldve said huzzah  i dont care what the bosoms say  i just want to be part of the conversation  hi guys  looks like youve been to the renaissance fair  im hoping  renaissance fair more of a medieval slash age of enlightenment  slash anyexcusetowearacodpiece fair  okay fine whatever this is my friend eric   hello  hey  so yeah good to see you  its good to see you too  we should probably go bye guys  i like your hat  thanks my mom made it  penny with a new guy trs awkward  it wasnt awkward  it wasnt fun  besides whats the big deal  we dated we stopped dating and now were both moving on  by moving on do you mean shes going out with other men  and you spent the afternoon making 15thcentury soap with wolowitz  that was not 15th century soap my god those people need to learn  you cant just put ye olde in front of anything you want  and expect to get away with it  can we please just go in my chain mails stuck in my underwear  youre wearing modern underwear  relatively modern  what are you wearing  i fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen  you bought linen  dont be silly i borrowed one of your pillowcases  borrowed   im happy that pennys moving on  it gives me the freedom to move on myself  are you saying that youve been holding back  of course out of respect  so how do you explain the ten years before penny  who were you respecting then  well ive dated plenty of women  there was joyce kim  leslie winkle  notify the editors of the oxford english dictionary  the word plenty has been redefined to mean two  what about that girl last year at comiccon   doesnt count  why not  what happens in costume at comiccon stays at comiccon  youre saying that because of what happened to you   what happened to you  nothing happened to me  it wasnt your fault  he was dressed as a green orion slave girl  how did we get on me  we were mocking leonard for not moving on  dude you have totally not moved on  yes i have  its just a matter of actually making a date with someone  like who  well theres joyce kim  but she defected back to north korea so  its a little geographically undesirable   what about leslie winkle  oh no   why  her research methodology is sloppy  shes unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity  and to make matters worse shes often mean to me   i think shes smoking hot  id hit that  youd hit particulate soil in a colloidal suspension  mud  i like leslie but shes not interested in dating  as much as using men as tools for stress release  yeah so be a tool  go get yourself a little rebound stress release  technically it would only be rebound if he and penny  had actually engaged in physical intimacy  like you and richard the slave girl  i bought him dinner and we kissed once that was it  and he told me his name was kimberly  you know how i know were not in the matrix  how  if we were the food would be better  hey leonard   hey leslie  hey dummy  hello to you  insufficiently intelligent person  ooh rush me to the burn unit  do you have a second i need to ask you something   sure  if youll excuse me  im going to go do work  that promises significant results as opposed to what you do  which does not  yeah you heard me  so i heard your relationship with penny crashed to the ground  like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory  where did you hear that  actually i read it wolowitz texted me  like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory yeah  i thought it was a pretty good one i gave him an lol  anyway it got me thinking now that youre unattached  maybe we can revisit our previous attachment  are you suggesting another bout of stress release  no im all done with casual sex from now on im fully committed  to the traditional relationship paradigm   really what changed  its hard to say  i guess theres a time in every womans life  when she gets tired of waking up on a strange futon  with a bunch of people she doesnt know  yeah i can see how that would a bunch of people  anyway i figure its time to slow things down and  who better to slow things down with than you  im flattered  so  how do you suggest we proceed  your place well order chinese youll rent a movie  artsy but accessible then light petting no coitus  sounds fun  ill leave the details up to you its better if you assume the male role  thank you thats very thoughtful  great  call me  great news my mom sent me my old nintendo 64   terrific  you know what this means dont you  break out the red bull its time to rock mario old school   i kind of have other plans tonight  but its friday  fridays always vintage game night  look mom included the memory card  we can pick up right where i left off in 1999  when i had pernicious anemia  the thing is someones coming over  no problem i have three controllers the more the merrier  its a date i have a date coming over  you cant blame me for not jumping to that conclusion  why whats so unusual about me having a date   statistically speaking  all right all right  nevertheless i have one now and id appreciate it if you would  make yourself scarce  im a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates  and an iq which cant be accurely measured by normal tests  how much scarcer could i be  you know what i mean could you just give us a little privacy   you want me to leave the apartment  yes  you mean just go someplace else and be  someplace else  yes  why should i leave this is my apartment too  i know  and if science ever discovers a second member of your species  and you two would like some privacy  id be more than happy to get out of your way  well all right then  what are you doing  playing super mario  on a poorly coded nintendo 64 emulator  why are you doing it on the stairs  i am a modern day napoleon exiled to the elba of the staircase  because leonard get this has a date  good for him  why are you sitting here why dont you just go to a movie or something  alone   yeah why not  what if i choke on my popcorn  who will administer the heimlich maneuver  then dont order popcorn  no popcorn at the mo listen to yourself   why dont you go to a coffee shop  i dont drink coffee  they have other things  what do they have  you know cookies pastries  pastries such as bear claws   yeah sure  i dont like bear claws  hey penny  dumbass  leslie winkle  of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world  why does it have to be leslie winkle  they have a lot in common i mean theyre both scientists  oh please the only way she could make a contribution to science  would be if they resumed sending chimps into space  okay well i have a date too so ill see ya  everybody has a date  even you mario going after princess peach  and what am i doing im just enabling you   this is pretty good orange chicken  yeah its from changs   not chows  no changs   what happened to chows  it changed  so  how many children do you think we should have  im sorry that was a little abrupt  a little  there are so many things to talk about before we discuss reproduction  i sure hope so  besides shortness what genetic weaknesses run in your family  sorry to interrupt  batterys dying continue  genetic weakness right  theres the lactose intolerance  dont forget the malepattern baldness  when his uncles sit around the dinner table  they look like a half carton of eggs  okay my uncles are bald  but my aunt edna is one of the hairiest women youll ever meet  sweet lady  always tickles when she hugs me   what now  i have to make peepee  im sorry about all of sheldons interruptions  he can be a bit of an eccentric  if by eccentric you mean passiveaggressive  east texas blowhole i agree  i think tonight was a very good start  me too  you sure youre okay postponing intercourse  until our relationship is past the initial viability test  no problem im very skilled at postponing intercourse  i guess ill call you and well arrange another evening  i believe protocol dictates you wait a minimum of 18 hours before you call  so im not repulsed by your cloying eagerness  sure  again its your decision youre the man  it wasnt my cat  it was an experiment designed by this guy named schroedinger  from the charlie brown cartoons  no he was some kind of scientist let me start again   hey leonard  hello   leslie  hi  okay well good night  okay good night  that aint gonna make your point  thats enough  call me  right  okay good night   what  had a great time ciao  im sorry i am not going back to the renaissance fair  come on  theres so few places i can wear my jester costume  i dont care  there are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort  okay how about this  you can go dressed as a star trek science officer  exploring a planet similar to earth in the 1500s  you mean like spock  sure  fascinating  hey fellow scientists  why dont we all move over there so leslie can join us  lets do it  if youre having trouble deciding where to sit  may i suggest one potato two potato  or as i call it the leslie winkle experimental methodology   dont make this hard for me  its not hard  its simple  you can either sit with me your friend colleague and roommate  or with an overrated scientist you might have sex with  youre right it is simple   hey sheldon  penny  third floor tonight mixing it up  i still dont understand why you dont go to dinner or something  all right lets say i go to dinner alone  and during the meal i have to use the restroom  how do i know someones not touching my food  good night sheldon  penny hold on  are you sure things cant work out with you and leonard  excuse me  im just wondering  if you really gave it the old college try  or in your case the old community college try  okay where is this coming from  leonard is upstairs right now with my archenemy  your archenemy  the dr doom to my mr fantastic  the dr octopus to my spiderman the dr sivana to my captain marvel  i get it  its amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees  graduate school should do a better job of screening those people out  sheldon come back youre losing me  its leslie winkle penny  she belittles my research  sweetie im sorry  she called me dumbass  i know i heard  given this situation  i have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections  to your illconsidered relationship with leonard  gee well thank you for that  but i think for now  leonard and i are just gonna stay friends  no that response is unacceptable to me  sheldon you are a smart guy  im smart  id have to lose 60 iq points to be classified as smart   are you gonna let me talk  im sorry  you must know that if leonard and leslie want to be together  nothing you can do is gonna stop it  you continue to underestimate my capabilities madam  let me put it this way if youre really leonards friend  you will support him no matter who he wants to be with  wait a minute why am i doing all the giving here  if leonards really my friend why doesnt he have to support me  and my hatred of leslie winkle  because love trumps hate  now youre just making stuff up  okay good night sheldon  mario  if only i could control everyone the way i control you  hop you little plumber hop hop hop  when the two of you reach a natural stopping point  id like to have a word  if the word is peepee just do it  leonard youre my friend  and friends support their friends apparently  so im withdrawing my objection  to your desire to have a relationship with leslie   thank you  i will graciously  overlook the fact that she is an arrogant  subpar scientist who actually believes loop quantum gravity  better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity  than does string theory  you kids have fun  hang on a second  loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions than string theory  im listening amuse me  for one thing we expect quantized spacetime to manifest itself  as minute differences in the speed of light for different colors  balderdash matter clearly consists of tiny strings  are you gonna let him talk to me like that  okay well there is a lot of merit to both theories  no there isnt only loop quantum gravity  calculates the entropy of black holes  sheldon dont make that noise its disrespectful  i should hope so it was a snort of derision  you agree with me right  loop quantum gravity is the future of physics  sorry leslie i guess i prefer my space stringy not loopy  im glad i found out the truth about you before this went any further  truth what truth  were talking about untested hypothes its no big deal  it isnt really  tell me how will we raise the children  i guess we wait until theyre old enough and let them choose their own theory  we cant let them choose theyre children  where are you going  im sorry  i could have accepted our kids being genetically unable to eat ice cream  or ever get a good view of a parade  but this  this is a deal breaker  look on the bright side  whats the bright side  only nine more months to comiccon  captain im getting an unusual reading  thats great you guys want corn dogs  thats a temporal anomaly  corn dogs didnt come into existence till the first half of the 20th century
