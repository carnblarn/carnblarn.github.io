                heres the problem with teleportation  lay it on me  assuming a device could be invented which would identify  the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location  and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly  you would not have transported the individual  you would have destroyed him in one location  and recreated him in another  how about that  personally i would never use a transporter  because the original sheldon would have to be disintegrated  in order to create a new sheldon  would the new sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old sheldon  no he would be exactly the same  that is a problem  so you see it too  dr hofstadter dr cooper  dr gablehauser  gentlemen id like you to meet dennis kim  dennis is a highly soughtafter doctoral candidate  and were hoping hell do his graduate work here   graduate work very impressive  and hes only 15 years old  not bad i myself started graduate school at 14  well i lost a year while my family was tunneling out of north korea  advantage kim  i thought maybe you boys could show dennis around  let him see why were the best physics research facility in the country  i already know youre not  you dont have an open science grid computer or a free electron laser  the string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end  excuse me that is my research and it is by no means a dead end  obviously you dont see it yet but trust me you will  dennis weve discussed this  were in the process of updating our equipment  and we welcome your input on our research goals  weve agreed to look the other way  if you use up to 20 of the grant money you attract  to smuggle your grandfather out of pyongyang  we want him here boys   make it happen  yes sir  you can count on us were on it  what the hell do you mean dead end  i mean the whole landscape of false vacuums in string theory  could be as large as 10 to the 500th power in addition  look chocolate milk  i sense a disturbance in the force  a bad feeling i have about this  season 1 episode 12 the jerusalem duality  dennis how long have you been in america   a year and a half  no kidding   you speak english really well  so do you  except for your tendency to end sentences with prepositions  what are you talking about  that  hes not wrong  all right and this is my office   is this part of the tour  nope goodbye  sheldon weve hardly shown him anything  all right this is my desk  these are my books this is my door please close it behind you goodbye  looks like youre doing work in quantum loop corrections  keen observation goodbye  you see where you went wrong dont you  get him out  come on ill show you the rec center theyve got nautilus equipment  do i look like i lift weights  not heavy ones  its startling you havent considered  a lorentz invariant or field theory approach  you think i havent considered it  you really think i havent considered it  have you considered it   get him out leonard  come on dennis  ill show you the radiation lab  you won the stevenson award  yes in fact i am the youngest person ever to win it  really how old  fourteen and a half  you were the youngest person ever to win it  its like looking into an obnoxious little mirror isnt it  this is really delicious isnt it  still cant talk to me unless youre drunk huh  sweetie you are so damaged  hey im damaged too  how about a hug for howie  sure raj hug howard  something youd like to share  a tale of woe perhaps   dennis kim is 15 years old and hes already correcting my work  today i went from being wolfgang amadeus mozart to   you know that other guy  antonio salieri  oh god now even you are smarter than me  you know you dont have so many friends  that you can afford to start insulting them  just eat sheldon youll feel better  why waste food  in texas when a cow goes dry they dont keep feeding it they just  take her out and shoot her between the eyes  im confused did sheldon stop giving milk  you cant let this kid get to you  you always knew that someday someone younger and smarter would come along  yes but i assumed i wouldve been dead hundreds of years  and that thered be an asterisk by his name because hed be a cyborg  so youve got a little competition i really dont see what the big deal is  of course you dont youve never excelled at anything  i dont understand exactly how did he get any friends in the first place  we liked leonard  what are you gonna do just give up  its what a rational person does when his entire lifes work  is invalidated by a postpubescent asian wunderkind  he ceases his fruitless efforts  he donates his body to scientific research  and he waits to die  im confused again is he waiting  or do we get to shoot him between the eyes  ive decided youre right my career is not over  great  since the arrival of dennis kim has rendered my research pointless  i just have to find something else to focus on  great  so ive decided im going to collaborate with you  great  so what exactly is it you do  you chatter on about it all the time but ive never really paid attention  right now im designing an experiment  to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at see level   but i really dont need any help  sure you do  see whats this here in the schematic is that a laser array   yes  now  what happens if you use argon lasers instead of heliumneon   it would blow up  are you sure  pretty sure  pretty sure is not very scientific  is this how you normally work just hunches and guesses and stuff  i understand that youre going through a bit of a career cris  youre searching for some other area  where you can feel valuable and productive  but i need to tell you something i want you to listen carefully   all right  go away  if youre concerned about sharing credit with me  your name can go first im going  its a small brown paper bag ma  im looking in it right now  why would i make that up theres no ding dong in it  how are two ding dongs tomorrow gonna help me today  so  this is engineering huh  ill talk to you later  engineering  where the noble semiskilled laborers  execute the vision of those who think and dream  hello oompaloompas of science  sheldon what are you doing here  i just came by to say hello  ive been in this lab for 3 years youve never come by to say hello  up until now ive had better things to do  so what are we making today  a small payload support structure  for a european science experimental package   thats going up on a space shuttle  really how does it work  when this is done it will be attached to the payload bay  and the sensor apparatus will rest on it  so its a shelf  no you dont understand during acceleration  it needs to stay perfectly level and provide  yeah its a shelf  i notice youre using titanium  did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes  theyre lighter cheaper and have twice the tensile strength  theres a diploma in my office  that says i have a masters in engineering  you also have a note from your mother that says i love you bubula  but neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes  go away  did leonard tell you to say that  no i thought of it all by myself  that cant be a coincidence  there must be some causal link im missing  go away  curiouser and curiouser   is he here  if he were i wouldnt be  do you know what he did he watched me work for 10 min  and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me  is that even possible  as it turns out yes  somethings got to be done about him  like what hell never be able to cope with the fact  that some 15yearold kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is  what if something happened to this boy  so he was no longer a threat to sheldon  then our problem would be solved  hang on are we talking about murdering dennis kim  im not saying no  we dont have to go that far there are other means available  we cant send him back to north korea  he knows how to get out  the only thing we need to do is make this kim kid lose his focus  wont happen he is not interested in anything but physics   what about biology  what  you know biology  the one thing that can completely derail a worldclass mind  hes 15  yeah so when i was 15 i met denise palmeri  and my grade point average fell from a 50 to a 18  she was sleeping with you  no i just  wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did  oh good youre all here  look if the three of you drop  whatever it is youre working on and join me  we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade 12 years tops  go away  could it be me  whats up  we need a hot 15yearold asian girl with a thing for smart guys  what  howard thats racist any 15yearold girl will do the trick  its possible she may have misunderstood us  dr cooper are we interrupting  no please come in i think youll appreciate this  this is very exciting   what are you working on  something remarkable  since my prospects for the nobel prize in physics have disappeared  thank you very much  ive decided to refocus my efforts  and use my people skills to win the nobel peace prize  i will solve the middle east crisis  by building an exact replica of jerusalem  in the middle of the mexican desert  to what end  its like the baseball movie  build it and they will come  who will come  the jewish people   what if they dont come  well make it nice put out a spread  okay well speaking of spreads  were having a small welcoming party this afternoon for mr kim  whos agreed to join us here at the university  of course he has  the oracle told us little neo was the one  you can see the matrix cant you  well obviously youre very busy with your  come dennis  youll have to excuse dr cooper hes been under a lot of  hes nuts  theyll come theyll settle and ill win the prize  i really dont understand your objections professor goldfarb  why wouldnt the sonora desert make a perfectly good promised land  go away  we could call it nuevo jerusalem  please go away  said pharaoh to moses  why are all these young women here  its take your daughter to work day  really i was not aware of that  yes there was a very official email  sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated  they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16   smooth  thank you  theres the man of the hour  okay so we now have a sociallyawkward genius  in a room full of attractive ageappropriate women  all he has to do now is hook up with one of them  anyone else see the flaw in this plan   we need a social catalyst  like what  we cant get 15yearold girls drunk   or can we  no we cant  i dont think you mean we cant i think you mean we shouldnt  youre a jew if there was another wailing wall  exactly like the one in jerusalem  but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs  would you still be able to wail at it  okay its definitely me  we cannot leave this to chance lets pick a girl  and figure out how to get her together with dennis  how about that one  i know the type  cheerleader student council goes out with the jocks  wont even look at anybody in the gifted program  if after 2 years of begging she agrees to go out with you  it turns out to be a setup and youre in your moms car with your pants off  while the whole football team laughs at y   are you crying  no i have allergies  okay  how about her  sure if he wants to spend two years  doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor  with nonfat white russians  youre holding her head out of the toilet while shes puking  and telling you she wishes more guys were like you  then she gets into cornell because you wrote her essay  for her and you drive up to visit her one weekend  and she acts like she doesnt even know you  okay so not her either  how about her  interesting kind of pretty  a little chubby so probably low selfesteem  i think thats our girl one of us should go talk to her  i cant talk to her you do it  i cant just go up and talk to her howard you talk to her  shell never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this  in india this would be simpler  and a laptop and wed be done   were not in india  why dont we do it your way then  well arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from dennis  so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end   okay that was uncalled for  you started it dude  could i have everyones attention please  what a wonderful occasion this is  and how fortunate that it should happen to fall  on take your daughter to work day  were here to welcome mr dennis kim to our little family  welcome dennis kim  mr kim  was not only the valedictorian at stanford university  he is also the youngest recipient  of the prestigious stevenson award  youngest till the cyborgs rise up  and now without any further ado  let me introduce the man of the hour  mr dennis kim  what  would you like to tell us a little bit about your upcoming research  no thanks im going to the mall with emma  the kid got a girl  unbelievable  did anyone see how he did it  dont worry ive got this  ladies and gentlemen  honored daughters  while mr kim by virtue of his youth and naivete  has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact  let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted  and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me  thank you   hes back  mission accomplished  forget the mission how did that little yutz get a girl on his own  i guess times have changed since we were young  smart is the new sexy  then why do we go home alone every night were still smart  maybe were too smart  so smart its offputting  yeah lets go with that  unbelievable  components i built are on the international space station  and i get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park  i dont know if the ticket was so much for the launch  as it was for you telling the policewoman  you have to frisk me i have another rocket in my pants  look at that  its dennis kim  i almost didnt recognize him  i kind of feel bad about what we did to him  yeah we really ruined his life  screw him he was weak
