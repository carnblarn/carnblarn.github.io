                that was close  god i love the smell of paintballs in the morning  yeah still funny  we cant get to the ridge  the chemistry department has us completely cut off  and the creek bed  the pharmacology department controls that  and theyre all hopped up on experimental steroids  thats it then were doomed  the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price  for some of us failing to attend  my physics department paintball strategy meeting  i told you my mom has spider veins  i had to take her to the laser clinic  and i told you i wanted to see a doctors note  we need a plan  how about operation hammer of the gods  which one is hammer of the gods  we hide behind the dumpsters in the parking lot  and ambush people when they come to pee  no go the dumpsters are deep in astronomy department territory  that shouldnt be a problem venus is up during the day  theyre probably just all staring at the sky  what we need now is a tactical retreat  did you see the episode of stargate  where they found themselves on a planet  with a culture based loosely on earths athens and sparta  not important  leonard raj and i are going to burst out the door and run away  howard will cover us  why dont i run away and you cover me  because you chose your mothers veins over victory  on three one two three go  i had to take her its almost bathing suit weather  i surrender dont shoot they went that way  howard im on your team  leslie thank god  wheres the rest of your squad  they left me here to die  what about yours   dead all of them  sorry  dont be  it was friendly fire  they just wouldnt listen  well were surrounded  so i guess theres nothing for us to do  but wait to be captured or killed  thats the worst part the waiting  all the while knowing that theres a paint pellet out there  with your name on it  the big wet ball of death  kind of makes you feel more alive doesnt it  it kind of does  i say we make every moment count  i agree  how exactly do we do that  why arent you covering us were getting slaughtered out here  war is hell   the fw team  did you guys see the budget nemo that went out this morning  more cutbacks  unacceptable it baffles me  why they dont simply let some of you go  so that theres money available for my research  you know what baffles me  based on your academic record any number of things i imagine   hey guys  hey  i got the approval for the rapid prototyper you wanted  thats great leslie thanks  you scratch my back i scratch yours  what was all that about  no big deal  they gave leslie control of some unrestricted grant money  yeah okay but whats with the backscratching and the meow  i believe the backscratching metaphor generally describes  a quid pro quo situation where one party provides  goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action   thank you  the meow  that sounded to me like an african civet cat  are you done  despite what the name suggests  the civet cat is not a true cat  now im done  you know what im thinking  im thinking howard wasnt making a backscratching metaphor  im thinking there was some actual scratching involved  what about it  i didnt want to say anything  cause i know you and leslie have a little history  i dont care about that  great ive been dying to say something   you and leslie  in the paintball shed twice  is that why you didnt cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals  oh yeah sorry about that  my good man dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy  is a courtmartial offense  courtmartial schmortmartial  leslie winkle is the fifth girl ive ever had sex with  i mean for free  plus you got a rapid prototyper  thats an expensive piece of equipment  and the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone  one way to look at
