kyle burnsteen barmistva party  i think we have to acknowledge  those was some fairly savage preadolescent jews  no we were annihilated by our own incompetence  and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command  sheldon let it go  no i want to talk about the fact that wolowitz shot me in the ck  i shot you for good reason  you were leading us into disaster  i was giving clear concise orders  you hid behind a tree yelling get the kid in the yarmulke  get the kid in the yarmulke  oh hey guys   oh hey penny hello  morning maam  so how was paintball did you have fun  sure if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun  you clear space on your calendar there will be an inquiry  okay  um hey im having a party on saturday   so if you guys are around you should come on

theme  um yeah halloween  yes but are the costumes random or genrespecific  as usual im not following  hes asking if we can come as anyone from science fiction fantasy   sure  what about comic books

earth paradigm  ill get it  oh no  oh no  make way for the fastest man alive  oh no  see this is why i wanted to have a costume meeting  we all have other costumes we can change  or we could walk right behind each other all night  and look like one person going really fast  no no no  its a boygirl party this flash runs solo  okay how about this  nobody gets to be the flash  we all change agreed  agreed  i call frodo  damn  hey  sorry im late but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus  you went with thor  what just because im indian i cant be a norse god  no no raj has to be an indian god  thats racism  i mean look at wolowitzhes not english   but hes dressed like peter pan  sheldon is neither sound nor light   but hes obviously the doppler effect  im not peter pan  im robin hood  really  because i sawpeter pan and youre dressed exactly like cathy rigby  she was a little bigger than you but its basically the same look man  hey sheldon theres something i want to talk to you about before we go to the party  i dont care if anybody gets it  im going as the doppler effect   no its not that  if i have to i can demonstrate  terrific  this party is my first chance for penny to see me in the context of her social group   and i need you not to embarrass me tonight  well what exactly do you mean by embarrass you  well for example tonight   no one needs to know that my middle name is leakey  but theres nothing embarrassing about that  your father worked with louis leakey   a great anthropologist  it had nothing to do with your bedwetting  all m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for penny  to see me as a member of her peer group   a potential close friend and perhaps more   and i dont want to look like a dork  just a heads up fellas  if anyone gets lucky ive got a dozen condoms in my quiver  oh hey guys  hey sorry were late  late  its 705  and you said the party starts at 700  well yeah i mean when you start a party at 700   no one shows up at you know 700  its 705  yes yes it is  okay well um come on in  so what are all the girls in the bathroom  probably but in their own homes  so what time does the costume parade start  the parade  yeah so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume  you know most frightening most authentic   most accurate visualization of a scientific principal  oh sheldon im sorry   but there arent going to be any parades  or judges or prizes  this party is just going to suck  no come on its going to be fun   and you all look great  i mean look at you thor   and oh peter pan  thats so cute   actually penny hes robin hood  im peter pan  and i got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it  no you dont  uh hey whats sheldon supposed to be  oh hes the doppler effect  yes its the apparent change in the frequency of a wave  caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer  oh sure i see it now  the doppler effect  all right i got to shower  you guys um make yourselves comfortable  okay  see  people get it  by odins beard this is good chex mix  no thanks peanuts  i cant afford to swell up in these tights  im confused  if theres no costume parade what are we doing here  were socializing meeting new people  telepathically  oh hey when did you get here  hi  penny is wearing the worst catwoman costume ive ever seen  and that includes halle berrys  shes not catwoman shes just a generic cat  and thats the kind of sloppy costuming  which results from a lack of rules and competion  hey guys check out the sexy nurse  i believe its time for me to turn my head and cough  what is your move  im going to use the mirror technique  she brushes her hair back i brush my hair back  she shrugs i shrug  subconsciously shes thinking were in sync we belong together  where do you get this stuff  you know psychology journals internet research   and theres this great show on vh1 about how to pick up girls  oh if only i had his confidence  i have such difficulty speaking to women or around women  or at times even effeminate men  if thats a working stethoscope   maybe youd like to hear my heart skip a beat  no thanks  no seriously you cani have transient idiopathic arrhythmia  i want to get to know pennys friends   i just dont know how to talk to these people  well i actually might be able to help  how so  like jane goodall observing the apes   i initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured  but patterns emerge  they have their own language if you will  go on  well it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting   how wasted am i  which is met with an approving chorus of dude  then what happens  thats as far as ive gotten  this is ridiculous  im jumping in  good luck  no youre coming with me  oh i hardly think so  oh come on  arent you afraid ill embarrass you  yes but i need a wing man  all right but if were going to use flight metaphors   im much more suited to being the guy  from the faa analyzing wreckage  hi  hi hello  so what are you supposed to be  me ill give you a hint  a choochoo train  close  a brain damaged choochoo train  how wasted am i  i still dont get it  im the doppler effect  okay if thats some sort of learning disability   i think its very insensitive  why dont you just tell people youre a zebra  well why dont you just tell people youre one of the seven dwarves  because im frodo  yes well im the doppler effect   oh no  what  thats pennys exboyfriend  what do you suppose hes doing here  besides disrupting the local gravity field  if he were any bigger hed have moons orbiting him  oh snap  so i guess well be leaving now  why should we leave  for all we know he crashed the party and penny doesnt even want him here  you have a backup hypothesis  maybe they want to be friends  or maybe she wants to be friends and he wants something more  then he and i are on equal ground  yes but youre much closer to it than he is  look if this was 1 500 years ago   by virtue of his size and strength   kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners  and male partners animal partners   large primordial eggplants  pretty much whatever tickled his fancy  yes but our society has undergone a paradigm shift  in the information age sheldon   you and i are the alpha males  we shouldnt have to back down  true  why dont you text him that and see if he backs down  no  im going to assert my dominance facetoface  facetoface are you going to wait for him to sit down   or are you going to stand on the coffee table  hello penny  hello kurt  oh hey guys are you having a good time  given the reaction to my costume   this party is a scathing indictment of the american education system  what youre a zebra right  yet another child left behind  and what are you supposed to be an elf  no im a hobbit  whats the difference  a hobbit is a mortal halfling inhabitant of middle earth   whereas an elf is an immortal tall warrior  so why the hell would you want to be a hobbit  because hes neither tall nor immortal  and none of us could be the flash  well whatever  why dont you go hop off on a quest  im talking to penny here  i think were all talking to penny here  im not no offense  okay maybe you didnt hear me   go away  all right kurt be nice  oh i am being nice  right little buddy   kurt  okay  i understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me  i mean you cant compete with me on an intellectual level  so youre driven to animalistic puffery  you calling me a puffy animal  of course not no hes not  youre not right leonard  no i said animalistic  of course were all animals   but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree  if he understands that youre in trouble  so what im unevolved  youre in trouble  you know you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf  okay kurt please  penny its okay i can handle this  i am not a dwarf   im a hobbit  a hobbit  are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion  from shortterm to longterm memory  okay now youre starting to make me mad  a homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what  what  i think ive made my point  yeah how about i make a point out of your pointy little head  let me remind you while my moral support is absolute   in a physical confrontation i will be less than useless  theres not going to be a confrontation  in fact i doubt if he can even spell confrontation  c on  frontation  kurt put him down this instant  he started it  i dont care im finishing itput him down  fine  youre one lucky little leprechaun  hes a hobbit  i got your back  leonard are you okay  yeah im fine  its good its a good party thanks for having us  its just getting a little late so  oh okay  all right well thank you for coming  happy halloween  if its any consolation   i thought that homo habilis line really put him in his place  whats that  tea  when people are upset   the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages  there there  you want to talk about it   no  good  there there was really all i had  good night sheldon  good night leonard  hey leonard  hi penny  hey i just wanted to make sure you were okay  im fine  i am so sorry about what happened  its not your fault  yes it is  thats why i broke up with him  he always does stuff like that  so why was he at your party  well i ran into him last week and he was just all apologetic about how hes changed  and he was just going on and on and  i believed him and im an idiot  because i always believe guys like that  and i cant go back to my party because hes there  and know you dont want to hear this and im upset  and im really drunk and i just want to  there there  god what is wrong with me  nothing youre perfect  im not perfect  yes you are  you really think so dont you  penny  yeah  how much have you had to drink tonight  just a lot  are you sure that your being drunk and your being angry with kurt  doesnt have something to do with whats going on here  it might  boy youre really smart  yeah im a frickin genius  leonard you are so great  why cant all guys be like you  because if all guys were like me   the human race couldnt survive  i should probably go  probably  thank you  thats right you saw what you saw  thats how we roll in the shire  coming  hey have you seen koothrappali  hes not here  maybe the avengers summoned him  hes not the marvel comics thor hes the original norse god  thank you for the clarification  im supposed to give him a ride home  well im sure hell be fine  he has his hammer  i have to say you are an amazing man  youre gentle and passionate  and my god you are such a good listener
