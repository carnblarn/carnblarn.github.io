                okay raj  hand me the 6 torx screwdriver  stop  we cant do this its not right  you have two choices either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the tivo  or you delete stuff before we go out of town  but once you open the box youve voided the warranty  the warranty  is a sacred covenant weve entered into with the manufacturer  he offers to stand by his equipment  and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware  this little orange sticker  is all that stands between us and anarchy  then we wont touch the hard drive  well just erase the first season of battlestar  there were outlaws  is this going to be big enough  its perfect  for taking daffodils to your unicorn  its just for my notebooks thanks penny  i love san francisco i wish i was going with you  i understand your envy this is a cantmiss symposium  there are going to be discussions on bioorganic cellular computer devices  the advancements in multithreaded task completion  plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium greens function approach  to the photoionization process in atoms  when i go i usually just get hammered and ride the cable cars  this conference is kind of a big thing  the keynote address is being delivered by george smoot  oh my god the george smoot   youve heard of him  of course i havent  george smoot is a nobel prizewinning physicist  one of the great minds of our time  his work in black body form and anisotropy  of the cosmic microwave background radiation  cemented our understanding of the origin of the universe  its kind of a funny name though smoot  its like talking to a chimp  now that ive been completely insulted have a good flight  i wish  were not flying were taking the train   oh cool  yeah cool  seven times as long as flying and costs almost twice as much   then why are you doing it  we had a vote  three of us voted for airplane sheldon voted for train  so were taking the train  dont say it like that say it like  were taking the train   the fw team  were all going over to the apple store  to make fun of the guys at the genius bar you want to come  i always enjoy that but im a little busy  what are you doing  im simplifying the task of packing for our trip  see by attaching rfid tags to my clothing  it will enable my laptop  to read and identify the items with this wand  i will then crossreference them against destination  anticipated activity spectrum  weather conditions duration of trip et cetera  that does sound much simpler  how long is this going to take  assuming i can keep up this pace three hours 11 minutes  plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation  teasing the guys at the apple store seems a little redundant now   i dont follow  i wouldnt expect you to see you  socks one pair  cotton argyle blue  socks one pair  cotton argyle blue  what on earth are you doing  whatever it is im guessing were doing it wrong  gentlemen this is the coast starlight  one of the great american trains  operating on one of the classic american routes  on this side youll see panoramic ocean vistas  inaccessible to any other form of transportation  while on your side youll be treated to 350 miles  of costcos jiffy lubes  and cinderblock homes with aboveground pools   come on raj  whats wrong with jiffy lubes   why not  thats over the wheelbase  are you completely unfamiliar  with the suspension characteristics of a pre1980  pullmanbuilt superliner deluxe passenger coach  weve been on this train 90 seconds  and youve already said a thousand words  just tell us where to sit and shut up  here  im hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards  of the steady clicketyclack of steel wheels on polished rails   your sour disposition will abate  yeah maybe  meanwhile back in the 21st century people are raising their tray tables  and putting their seatbacks in an upright position  cause its time to land in san francisco  its not so bad really at least these trains have modern plumbing  in india you squat over a hole in the train  and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of rajasthan  he is referring of course to third class on indian railways  magnificent ranakpur express and its 1200kilometer journey  from maharashtra to the bikaner junction  oh look now hes boring on an international scale  holy crap look   is that who i think it is  it cant be  what would summer glau be doing riding the train  maybe john connors aboard and shes protecting him from an evil terminator  unlikely thats a television show  thank you  of course if skynet actually did exist in the future  a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind  would be to send terminators back posing as actors  who have played terminators in popular films and television series  lulling us into a false sense of security  ie thats summer glau from the sarah connor chronicles  no summer dont kill me im prorobot  at least hes off the train crap  i owe you an apology taking the train was a stroke of brilliance  ive actually got a shot at a terminator  please when it comes to terminators  youve got a better shot of scoring with arnold schwarzenegger  youre overlooking something  i have 11 hours with her in a confined space  unless shes willing to jump off a moving train  tuck and roll down the side of a hill  she will eventually succumb to the acquired taste  that is howard wolowitz  my moneys on tuck and roll  im confused i thought you were involved  in some sort of socially intimate pairing with leslie winkle   let me explain to you how this works  all right  thats summer glau  thats it  hang on a sec why do you get first crack at her  lets see couple reasons   one i saw her first  no you didnt i did  fair enough but then let me move on to 2  unlike you i can actually talk to women when im sober  you fail to take into account that even mute  i am foreign and exotic  while you on the other hand are frail and pasty  you know the old saying  pasty and frail never fail  excuse me but what about me why dont i get a shot  fine go ahead  take a shot  ive already got a gorgeous blonde back home that i cant score with  i think ill let you two take this one  is there a place on this train to get alcohol  interesting that you ask  the coast starlight recently added the refurbished pacific parlour car  built in 1956 and originally known as the santa fe lounge car  the lower level is a theater and the upper level is a bar that offers  wine tastings if youre going as far as portland   so arent you going to go talk to her  i will im just  working on my opening line  shes probably heard every possible line  why dont you just try hello  no no that always creeps girls out  i need to come up with something thats funny  smart and delicately suggests that my sexual endowment  is disproportionate to my physical stature  youre going to need more than 11 hours   oh no  whats the matter   i forgot my flash drive  so  so we have to go back  okay im going to say why  and your answer cannot be because i forgot my flash drive  you dont understand  my flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes  of mtheory effects in the early universe  that i was going to give to george smoot at the conference  why do you have to give your paper to george smoot  its brilliant he needs to read it  so youll send him an email when we get back  then i wont get to see his face light up as he reads it   right of course  this is an unmitigated disaster  theres nothing you can do about it so relax  sit back enjoy the clicketyclack  of the steel wheels on the polished rails  you forgot your flash drive you forgot your flash drive  only ten hours 55 minutes to go  its hot in here must be summer  so where you gals headed  okay ive found the perfect solution  we get off the train at the next stop in oxnard  we then take the 113 train back to union station  we take a cab back to the apartment get my flash drive  and then race to san luis obispo where assuming the lights are with us  and minimal traffic well meet the train   ive got a better idea  are you going to be sarcastic  you take all the fun out of it for me  pennys home why dont we call her have her go in the apartment  get your flash drive and email you the paper  but the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk   so  the key is hidden in my room   so  penny would have to go into my room   so  people dont go in my room  i see it seems once again  youre caught between a rock and a crazy place  i hate when that happens  its hot in here must be summer  its hot in here must be summer  its hot in here must be summer   thats cute  really i just made it up  have you seen slumdog millionaire  yeah i loved it  its loosely based on my life  were putting the play on for one night in this little 99seat theater  can you come  oh great  do you know 98 other people that might want to come  hang on  listen carefully im about to give you  a set of instructions which you must follow to the letter  just a sec  the theater is above a bowling alley so its a little noisy  but it might be the only chance ill ever get to play anne frank  and the director is brilliant  he uses the bowling sounds as like nazi artillery  great ill see you then   hello  okay step four  do you see that small plastic case on my dresser  your dresser who is this   its sheldon  hey sheldon

the hopeless geeks  those are crazy people  howard be a dear and get me another one of these  now him hes one of those geeks  all right now before you enter my bedroom unescorted  i need you to understand that this onetime grant of access  does not create a permanent easement  easement  its a legal right of access good grief  what no dont put me on hold  do you believe him  normally around women he has the personality  of a boiled potato  put one beer in him and hes m night charmalarmalon  is that what hes drinking its not even real beer   what  look  nonalcoholic beer   whats going on  i dont know  some sort of placebo effect i guess  placebo you say  interesting  yes im still here where am i going im on a train  now what youll be looking for  is a small wooden box located between a hobermans sphere  and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite  hobermans sphere  its a collapsible icosidodecahedron  no the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock  actually in india the names of constellations are different  where you have the big dipper  we have the big curry pot  youre making that up  you got me  now what are you going to do with me  look   what am i looking at  you tell me  nonalcoholic beer  hi im the small package good things come in  i got a box  but theres no key in here just letters  thats the wrong box put it back  are these letters from your grandmother  dont read those letters  look she calls you moon pie that is so cute  put down the letters  hey penny its leonard   hows the train ride  delightful  i dont know what youre doing  but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of sheldons mouth  yeah i kind of crossed a line put him back on  thank you   im back  what up moon pie  no one calls me moon pie but meemaw  hey penny leonard again  in the dream you and i were ice skating just the two of us  and then i picked you up by your ankles  and twirled you round and round until your legs tore off  i tried to stick them back on  but before i could  you turned into a giant loaf of pumpernickel bread  what do you think that means  i really dont know  ill give you a clue  my favorite sandwich salami on pumpernickel  is that so  did you know pumpernickel  comes from the german words pumper and nickel  which loosely translates to fart goblin  i didnt  okay i found the box now what  youre holding a japanese puzzle box which takes  ten precise moves to open  first locate the panel with the diamond pattern  and slide the center portion one millimeter to the left  then on the opposite end of the box  slide the entire panel down two millimeters  youll hear a slight click  hang on  do you have any emotional attachment to this box  no its a novelty i ordered off the internet  did you hear the click  not yet  there it is  okay heres another one  if you married the famous rock guitarist johnny winter  youd be summer winter  im going to just go for broke here and say i like you  so heres my question  do you realistically see any conversational path  that would take us from where we are right now  to a place where i could ask you out and youd say yes  fair enough ill leave you in peace  thank you  but before i go  would you mind  if i take one picture of us together for my facebook page  sure  great now can i take one where it looks like were making out  now youre going to insert the flash drive  into the usb port  she calls me moon pie  because im nummynummy  and she could just eat me up  now please put the flash drive in the usb port  the one that looks like a little ducks mouth  howd it go  terminator broke my phone  excuse me  ill be honest with you  ive just spent the last two hours imaging various scenarios in my head  trying to come up with some clever line to say to you  but i finally realized youre a human being  im a human being   i could just say  next stop santa barbara  im sorry this is me  hi my names leonard  so im thinking you won  the nobel prize what three years ago  so you must deal with a whole lot of what has smoot done lately  my thought is we continue my research as a team  you know coopersmoot alphabetical  and when we win the nobel prize youll be back on top  with all due respect dr cooper are you on crack  fine smootcooper  what a diva
