                so if any of you are considering going into experimental physics  my door is always open  once again im sorry the demonstration didnt quite work out  but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill  peach snapple into a helium neon laser  short answer is dont  and now to tell you about the theoretical physics department  is dr sheldon cooper  forget it  excuse me   sheldon we both agreed to do this  its a waste of time  i might as well explain the laws of thermodynamics  to a bunch of labradoodles  if you dont do this  i wont take you to the comic book store  nice work with the laser by the way  looking out at your fresh young faces  i remember when i too was deciding my academic future  as a lowly graduate student  of course i was 14  and id already achieved more than most of you could ever hope to  despite my 900 bedtime  now there may be one or two of you in this room  who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics  its more likely that youll spend  your scientific careers teaching  how to make papier mache volcanoes with baking soda lava   good god  in short  any one who told you that you would someday be able  to make any significant contribution to physics  played a cruel trick on you a cruel trick indeed  any questions  of course not  i weep for the future of science  now if youll excuse me the latest issue of batman is out  come leonard  laser demonstrations looking pretty good now huh   subwayfr  i love this time of the year  the leaves are turning theres a bracing chill in the air  plus theres a whole new crop of female grad students  about to put on just enough winter weight  to make them needy and vulnerable  thats right honey have another calzone  daddy can wait  isnt there a university policy against dating graduate students  no if you can talk to them you can ask them out  damn theres always a catch   hey guys  hey leslie  so dumbass i heard you made a grad student throw up last night  the truth can indeed be a finger down the throat  of those unprepared to hear it  but why should i cater to secondrate minds  because firstrate minds call you dumbass  oh yeah well  youre a mean person  excuse me dr cooper  im ramona nowitzki i was at your talk last night  i think youre just brilliant  that is the prevailing opinion  now im gonna throw up  howard wolowitz department of engineering  codesigner of the international space stations  liquid waste disposal system  ive read everything youve published  i liked your paper on grand unification using stringnetwork condensates  and was wondering how you determined that 3dimensional stringnets  provided a unified picture of ferrnions and gauge bosons  amazing an intelligent labradoodle  the fact is im quite close to a breakthrough  in showing how neutrinos emerge from a stringnet condensate  my god that would change the way we view the entire physical universe  its what i do  you know the pishkinwolowitz liquid waste disposal system  is turning a few heads as well  again ew  id love to hear more about how you intend to add neutrinos  could we get a cup of coffee sometime  i dont drink coffee  i do i love me a cup of joe  it doesnt have to be coffee how about dinner   i do eat dinner  great   i know a terrific italian place  i never eat in strange restaurants  one runs the risk of nonstandard cutlery  excuse me  sheldon lives in fear of the threetined fork  three tines is not a fork  three tines is a trident  forks are for eating tridents are for ruling the seven seas  what if i brought food to your place  that would be acceptable  on mondays i eat thai food  mee krob and chicken sate  with extra peanut sauce from siam palace  you got it  i already have your address  what a nice girl  do you have any idea what just happened  yes apparently im getting a free dinner  oh yeah no this things majorly out of order   see sorry  thats okay  guess im taking the stairs   where you going  4 a   you here to see leonard  no dr cooper  dr sheldon cooper  were having dinner  sheldon cooper  tall thin  looks a little like a giant praying mantis  he is cute isnt he   hi leonard  hey ramona come on in   thanks where should i put this  the kitchens fine   hey what are you doing  i need to see this  the viewing areas right over there  sheldon your girl date person ramonas here   hello  sorry im late  i just got so caught up reading the draft of your latest paper  did you enjoy the humorous footnote where i illustrate mirrorsymmetry  by likening it to the flash playing tennis with himself  so funny  but the idea that you might be able to incorporate gravity  i have to tell you i found it physically exhilarating  my hypotheses tend to have that effect  im sorry i didnt bring enough for your friends  i assumed we were going to be alone  no we were just going  to watch right  no come on now were going out  come on well be quiet  lets go  okay you two  have a nice  whatever this is  okay you guys look i know this is none of my business  but i just i have to ask  whats sheldons deal   what do you mean deal  you know like whats his deal  is it girls guys sock puppets  honestly weve been operating under the assumption  that he has no deal  come on everybody has a deal  not sheldon  over the years weve formulated many theories  about how he might reproduce  im an advocate of mitosis  im sorry  i believe one day sheldon will eat an enormous amount of thai food  and split into two sheldons  on the other hand i think sheldon might be the larval form of his species  and someday hell spin a cocoon and emerge two months later  with moth wings and an exoskeleton  okay well thanks for the nightmares  hey do you want to hang out with us  what are you guys gonna do  my moms making a brisket tonight  the one with the little onions  yeah im busy so  good night  her loss lets go  brisket party  b tothertotheisk  totheetothet  dont  arent you having breakfast  yes  are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again  not in these pants  so howd it go with ramona last night  great shes smart insightful  and she has a very unique way of you know revering me  heres your spinach mushroom omelet  thank you   did anyone touch it  gloves were worn by everyone involved  i was vigilant  ramona pointed out that ive been wasting 20 minutes a day   standing on cafeteria lines  time which would be better spent  tackling the great physics problems of our day  you dont tackle the big issues you fence with them  en garde riposte  touche   morning  hey lesly  so i see youre organizing your papers  for the smithsonian museum of dumbassery  there wont be any room until they get rid  of the permanent leslie winkle exhibit  good one  i see you got a grad student to fight your battles for you  ill let you keep your lunch money today  dr cooper is on the verge of a breakthrough  if youre going to stay youll have to be respectful and quiet  wait for me  have you worked out the neutrino issue  well to paraphrase mozart all the subatomic particles are there  i just have to put them in the right order  youre so witty  arent i  hey guys this package came for  dr cooper is working  yes im close to a breakthrough  it tickles  sorry  holy crap on a cracker  you probably dont want to go in there  why what are they doing  the only way i could explain it would be in a therapists office with dolls  boy  dr coopers working  yeah i can see that  sheldon halo night koothrappalis you coming  yes its halo night  let me just dry my tootsies   youre not going to halo night  yes i am  its wednesday wednesdays halo night  didnt a great man once say science demands nothing less  than the fervent and unconditional dedication  of our entire lives   he did  and who was that great man  me   sorry leonard  seriously youre not coming  you heard her how can i argue with me  okay well once again you guys have a good  whatever this is  dr cooper i have to tell you your friends are holding you back  i prefer to think of it as im pulling them forward  halo night  a man with your intellectual gifts  doesnt waste an evening playing video games  he does on wednesdays  not if he wants a nobel prize  he does want that  does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends   what do you think  drat   now shall we get back to work  i suppose  battlestar galactica comes on tonight  i guess i can wait for the dvd  and then never ever watch it  sheldon honey ive told you its a small apartment  you only have to knock one time  i dont have a lot of time  ramona finally dozed off  and i need you to help me get rid of her  get rid of her how  i dont know  but apparently im in some kind of relationship  and you seem to be an expert at ending them  excuse me  i see man after man leaving this apartment never to return  okay first of all it is not man after man  hide me   hide you  i formally request sanctuary  why arent you working  she distracted me  i told you penny i dont have time for your nonsense  i have important things to do  oh man   i know whats going on here  really  then will you explain it to me  youre in love with dr cooper  yeah no thats not it  dont try to deny it  hes a remarkable man  but you have to let him go  gee okay  i know its hard but hes a gift to the whole world  and we cant be selfish  yeah hes a gift all right  sisters  sure  sisters  holy crap on a cracker  what are you doing  its morse code  why  so we can communicate through the wall  we are communicating through the wall  yes but the communication is not encrypted  i dont know morse code  its very simple this is a  this is b   this is c  im not going to learn morse code  at 300 in the morning  all right  dont come in here dont come in here  whats going on  ramonas sleeping on the couch  i know when is she going home  never thats the problem   i need your help  what are you talking about  im invoking the skynet clause of our friendship agreement  that only applies if you need me  to help you destroy an artificial intelligence  youve created thats taking over the earth  come on dont nitpick  good night  all right  im invoking our body snatchers clause  the body snatchers clause requires me to help you destroy  someone we know whos been replaced with an alien pod  shes in the living room go ill wait here  sheldon what are you doing out of bed  now do it  you know you need your sleep in order for your cognitive processing  to perform at optimum levels now come on  godzilla clause  not unless she destroys tokyo  rats  ive got it  i finally reconciled the black hole information paradox  with my theory of stringnetwork condensates  its unbelievable its paradigmaltering  i could not have done it without you  please i just offered a little encouragement  it was a lot more than that  you helped me work out the masses of all the fermions  and you pumiced my hammer toe  how can i ever repay you  would you consider naming it the coopernowitzki theorem  whos nowitzki  im nowitzki  you want me to share credit  get out  bite me  sisters  excuse me dr cooper  im kathy obrien i just finished reading your paper  reconciling the black hole information paradox  with your theory of stringnetwork condensates  and it just took my breath away  maybe when i publish it ill include an inhaler  would you possibly have any time for me to pick your brain  lets see todays thursday  thursday nights i eat pizza from giacomos  sausage mushrooms light olives  great ill bring it to your place  i have the address  what a nice girl  sheldon do you see what just happened here  yes im getting a free pizza  im on a roll  more pad thai please  sheldon youve already had four servings  you might want to slow down a bit  just one more bite  are you okay  im just so  full  thats it no more thai food
