                fellas please  penny come on we were just finding our sound  you found it  its the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower  im really very busy  is there any way that we can put this off  until i have more time to prepare  of course but you understand my trepidation   whats that about  not a clue  cant we just postpone it till the spring  maybe next summer  this should be fairly easy to deduce  hes holding the phone to his left ear  ears do not cross hemispheres so hes using the analytical  rather than the emotional side of the brain  suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller  no i didnt realize it had been so long  sure i guess theres no other choice but to just go ahead and do it  hes referring to an activity he has done before  its unpleasant and needs to be repeated  this suggests some sort of invasive medical test  like perhaps a colonoscopy  arent there any other options theres not a lot of room   its gonna be uncomfortable  yes yes  im definitely going with colonoscopy  okay bye  my mothers coming to visit  how about that you were right its out of order  yes i can read the sign im just pondering the implications  i think it implies that the elevator doesnt work  again i can read the sign  but the sign and the tape are covered with a layer of dust  which indicates that the elevator has been nonfunctional  for a significant amount of time  which suggests either a remarkable passivity  among the i assume   based on the number of mailboxes  and given typical urban population density  or a shared delusion of functionality  you must be leonards mother  i dont know if i must be but yes  im penny im his neighbor  dr beverly hofstadter  nice to meet you  youre a hand shaker interesting  come with me ill walk you to the apartment  would you like to exchange pleasantries on the way   yeah sure i guess  all right you start  ive always been curious what was leonard like when he was little  i think you mean young hes always been little  right what was he like when he was young  youll have to be more specific  okay like five or six  five  at that age he was well enmeshed  in what freud would call the phallic stage of psychosexual development  an outmoded theory of course but the boy did spend  most of his waking hours with a tight grasp on his penis  leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist  that is one of my degrees my primary field is neuroscience  well im an actress  why  what do you mean why  there are studies that suggest that many who go into  the performing arts suffer from an external locus of identity  yeah i dont know what that means  it means you value yourself only as others value you  which is often the result of unmet childhood emotional needs  i had a wonderful childhood  tell me about it  i know my dad wanted a boy  i tried being good at sports but i hated getting dirty  and then im assuming you entered adolescence  he called me slugger until i got my first training bra  and then he just stopped playing catch with me  i wasnt slugger anymore  your mothers here  if you want to have intercourse with that girl  find out what kind of cologne her father wore  good to see you mother  heres your tea mother  oolong  loose not bagged  steeped three minutes  twopercent milk  warmed separately  one teaspoon sugar  raw sugar  its cold  ill start again  i have the same problem with him  my theory is that his lack of focus stems from an overdeveloped sex drive  i dont know where he wouldve gotten that  aside from a pro forma consummation of our marriage  his father and i only had intercourse for the purposes of reproduction  that seems a fairly efficient arrangement  yes we think so weve both done papers on it  mine from the neuroscientific point of view  and his from an anthropological  mine of course was the onlyne worth reading  of course  i would very much like to read about your sex life  its all online or you can order it from the princeton university press  heres your tea mother  so what are you guys talking about  the frequency with which your parents had intercourse  swell  if youre lucky maybe shell show you the powerpoint presentation  im sorry its on my other laptop  so mother   whats new  youll have to be more specific  all right whats new with you  well ive been having some fascinating menopausal symptoms recently  maybe something less personal  your uncle floyd died  oh my god what happened  his heart stopped beating  i have to urinate  what a remarkable woman  yeah ii thought you guys might hit it off  i envy you your childhood  i hate to tell you but the only warm memories  i have of my childhood are of my uncle floyd  youre clearly misremembering your mother is brilliant  analytical insightful  and im betting she never hit you with a bible  because you wouldnt eat your brussels sprouts  you dont give your mother enough credit  shes warm shes loving  she doesnt glue electrodes to your head  to measure your brain waves while potty training  you were lucky when i was a kid if i wanted an eeg  i had to attach my own electrodes  so dr hofstadter leonard rarely talks  about his incredibly successful brother and sister  please dont go there  i understand that  unlike leonard theyre at the top of their respective fields  boy you suck  leonards younger brother michael is a tenured law professor at harvard  and his sister just successfully grew  a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon  so shes close to curing diabetes  why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon  you must be very proud  why theyre not my accomplishments  i have to urinate   why are you doing this  you know the rules  you brought your mom to work you must suffer  i had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you  youre like the jar jar binks of the hofstadter family  oh mesa think yousa lookin so so sad  rather than mock me my friends might realize  that this is difficult and try to help me through it  nope i think mocking you is more fun  next time dont yousa bring mama to work okeeday   that was fast  the middle stall was occupied  ill have to try again later  thats totally understandable in bladder voiding as in real estate  its location location location   so where were we  howard lives with his mother  and raj cant speak to women unless hes drunk go  thats fascinating selective mutism is quite rare  on the other hand an adult jewish male living with his mother is so common  it borders on sociological clich  its just temporary i pay rent  he lives in the same room where his bassinet was  both selective mutism  and an inability to separate from ones mother  can stem from a pathological fear of women  it might explain why the two of you have created an ersatz homosexual marriage  to satisfy your need for intimacy  say what  thats basically what i just said  you brought your husband to work you know the rules  meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too betcha betcha  leonard its 100 werent you going to show me your laboratory at 100  theres no hurry tell them more about their secret love for each other  but its 100 you were going to show me your laboratory at 100  her reasoning is unassailable it is 100  fine lets go  i think youll find my work pretty interesting  im attempting to replicate the dark matter signal  found in sodium iodide crystals by the italians  so no original research  whats the point of my seeing it  i could just read the paper the italians wrote  just for the record were not in an ersatz homosexual relationship   then why didnt you say that to her  why is it always my responsibility  its not always your responsibility  i swear this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week  i cant believe youre bringing that up   i didnt bring it up you did  well talk about this later  you always say that but you never do  you went to the comic book store without me   you got alcohol  your mom still here  come on in  wait shes not gonna come here looking for you is she  relax she took sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan  oh my god what happened  nothing mother likes looking at brains  and sheldon likes getting his brain scanned  geez what a fun couple  shes only been here a day and a half  and im seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path  i talked to her for 5 minutes yesterday and ive been half bombed ever since  you cant let her get into your head   my head what about yours  its too late for me  my head is her summer house  she was right  the locus of my identity is totally exterior to me  yeah there she is hi mom  do you know where i was all morning  auditioning with 50 other blondes  for some stupid antidepressant commercial  and for what  so ill finally get my daddys approval   did you get the part  no they said i was too perky  you want to talk about not getting love from a parent  you know what i used to do when i was little  to have some sensation of human contact  yeah you grabbed your penis and wouldnt let go  your mother told me  of course she did thats not what i was gonna say  when i was ten years old i built a hugging machine  a hugging machine  i got a dressmakers mannequin  i stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm  and built two radiocontrolled arms  that would hug me and pat my back  that is so sad  you know what the saddest part was my father used to borrow it  your scan data will be very helpful to my research  you have a remarkable brain  i know  although ive always hated  how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures  common complaint among men  nothings ever big enough  except when they get a tumor then you never hear the end of it  id love to see a scan of your brain sometime  ill send you a link but its physiology is fairly unimpressive  i cant believe that  your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence  suggests an attempt at flattery  my apologies  ive been living with your son too long gotten into some bad habits  understandable   can i make you a cup of tea  i doubt it  but if anyone has a chance its probably you  i feel very comfortable around you  i feel very comfortable around you too  its surprising  because i generally dont feel comfortable around  well anyone  nor i  what are the odds that two individuals  as unique as ourselves would be connected  by someone as comparatively workaday as your son  is that a rhetorical point or would you like to do the math  id like to do the math  id like that too  now this time  youre gonna lick the salt  off my neck  do the shot  and then  bite the lime  im sorry i didnt hear anything after lick  neck shot lime   shot lime  right  wheres the lime  were sharing  so what do you think  im very tempted  im just not sure its appropriate with my sons roommate  normally id feel the same way  but based on everything ive observed about us  i cant help but speculate wed be very good together  true ive had a similar observation  its certainly something i could never do with my husband  i was hesitant the first time i tried it  but i experienced an unanticipated  and remarkable release of endorphins  its quite satisfying  i see what youre doing  youre appealing to the neuroscientific researcher in me  you see right through me dont you  only when youre in a cat scanner  this is actually gonna happen  honey shush shush  you shush im happy i want to talk about it  you know what my mother would say she would say  because you werent loved by your father and i was not loved by my mother  that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy  we didnt get as children  why would you bring that up right now  i dont know  foreplay  so youre saying youre not having sex with me  youre having sex with your mother  im gonna go with no  that is the sickest thing ive ever heard  come on  youre trying to have sex with your father and im okay with that  get out  she said shush i should have shushed  all right mother  have a nice flight  thats not really in my control is it   good morning  morning   i was just coming over to talk to you  you dont have to  ever  gotcha   goodbye mother  goodbye  so slugger shall we pick up where we left off last time  i mean my mom couldve just said  bob get over it shes a girl move on   but she didnt not one word  interesting  would you be willing to fly to new jersey  and discuss your relationship with your parents during a brain scan   would it help  well it would help me
