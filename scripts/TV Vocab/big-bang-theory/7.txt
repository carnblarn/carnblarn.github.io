                watch this its really cool  call leonard hoffstadder  did you say call hellen boxlightner  call leonard hoffstadder  did you say call temple badsaidor  let me try  call  calling rajesh koothrappali  thats very impressive  and a little racist  if were all through playing mock the flawed technology  can we get on with halo night  we were supposed to start at  so well start now  first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming  out of game time bathroom time or the pizza break  we could split it two two and two  if were having anchovies on the pizza we cant take it out of bathroom time  oh what fresh hell is this   hey penny come on in  hey guys  see a penny pick her up  and all the day youll have good luck  no you wont  can i hide out here for a while  sure whats going on  theres this girl i know from back in nebraska christy  she called me up and shes like hey hows california  and im like awesome cause you know its not nebraska  and the next thing i know  shes invited herself out here to stay with me   anyway she got here today and shes just been in my apartment  yakity yakking about every guy she slept with in omaha  which is basically every guy in omaha  and washing the sluttiest  collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink  is she doing it one thong at a time or does she throw it all in  like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse   he really needs to dial it down  i know  so if you dont like this christy why are you letting her stay  she was engaged to my cousin  while she was sleeping with my brother so shes kind of family  i apologize for my earlier outburst  who needs halo when we can be regaled  with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of omaha  i dont think shes a whore  no yeah shes definitely a whore  i mean she has absolutely no standards  this one time she was at  wheres howard  bonjour mademoiselle i understand youre new in town  oh good grief   i cannot believe christy let howard into my apartment  and i cannot believe people pay for horoscopes  but on a more serious note  its 813 and were still not playing halo  fine well just play oneonone until he gets back  oneonone we dont play oneonone we play teams not oneonone  oneonone  the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut raj in half  sure cut the foreigner in half  theres a billion more where he came from  if you guys need a fourth ill play   great idea  no  the wheel was a great idea  relativity was a great idea  this is a notion and a rather sucky one at that  why  why  oh penny penny penny  what what what  this is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve  there are myriad weapons vehicles and strategies  to master not to mention an extremely intricate backstory  oh cool whose head did i just blow off  mine  okay i got this lock and load boys  its the only way we can play teams  yes but whoevers her partner will be hamstrung  by her lack of experience and not to mention the fact  there goes your head again  its not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody whos just respawned  you need to to give them a chance to now come on  raj raj shes got me cornered cover me  cover this suckers   penny you are on fire  yes and so is sheldon  okay thats it i dont know how but she is cheating  no one can be that attractive and this skilled at a video game  wait sheldon come back you forgot something  what  this plasma grenade  look its raining you  you laugh now you just wait until you need tech support  gosh hes kind of a sore loser isnt he  to be fair hes also a rather unpleasant winner  well its been fun  we make such a good team  maybe we could enter a couple of halo tournaments sometime  or we could just have a life  i guess for you thats an option   good night  good night  as usual nice talking to you raj  what do you suppose she meant by that  shes an enigma raj  and another thing theres a certain ethic to the game penny   a well established  shes gone  she could have said goodbye  okay i have a problem  its called carpal tunnel syndrome and quite frankly you deserve it  whats wrong  howard and christy are  kind of hooking up in my bedroom  are you sure  i grew up on a farm okay  from what i heard theyre either having sex  or howards caught in a milking machine  do you mind if i stay here tonight  no take the couch or my bed  i just got new pillows hypoallergenic  the couch is good  hold that thought leonard a moment  let me guess you have a problem with this   where do i begin  its up to you crazy persons choice  first we dont have houseguests  frankly if i could afford the rent id ask you to leave  your friendship means a lot to me as well what else  well  our earthquake supplies we have a twoman twoday kit  so  so if theres an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here  we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon  im sorry are you suggesting that if we let penny stay  we might succumb to cannibalism  no one ever thinks itll happen until it does  if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones  while we sleep you can stay   what  hes engaging in reductio ad absurdum  its the logical fallacy of extending someones argument  to ridiculous proportions and then criticizing the result  and i do not appreciate it  ill get you a blanket and a pillow  okay since im obviously being ignored here  lets go over the morning schedule  i use the bathroom from 700 to 720  plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly  how am i supposed to plan my bodily functions  i suggest no liquids after 1100 pm   here you go  thanks leonard  wrong  im listening  your head goes on the other end   why  its culturally universal a bed  even a temporary bed  is always oriented with the headboard away from the door  it serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders  ill risk it  anything else should i know  yes if you use my toothbrush  ill jump out that window  please dont come to my funeral have a good night  sorry about that   thats okay  fyi  his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglas case under the uv light  got it   sleep tight  thanks  funny expression sleep tight  it refers to the early construction of beds  which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes  which would occasionally  sleep tight  what are you doing  every saturday since weve lived in this apartment  i have awakened at 615 poured myself a bowl of cereal  added a quarter cup of two percent milk  sat on this end of this couch turned on bbc america  and watched doctor who  pennys still sleeping  every saturday since weve lived in this apartment  i have awakened at 615 poured myself a bowl  i know you have a tv in your room  why dont you just have breakfast in bed  because i am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating mothers day  what time is it  almost 630  i slept all day  no its 630 in the morning  what the hell is your problem  okay this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity  i now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste  hola nerdmigos  why do you people hate sleep  are you wearing my robe  yeah sorry ill have it cleaned  thats okay keep it   wheres christy  in the shower  by the way where did you get that loofah mitt  yours reaches places that mine just wont  you used my loofah  more precisely weused your loofah  i exfoliated her brains out  you can keep that too  then well probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection  in here milady  heres my little engine that could  theres one beloved childrens book ill never read again  hi christy   im sheldon  right  youre howards entourage  so christy what are your plans  howard said hed take me shopping in beverly hills  yeah no i meant plans to find someplace to live  other than with me not that i dont love having you  but its its a little crowded  penny youre always welcome to stay with us  oh terrific now were running a cute little b  b  let me offer a little outsidethebox thinking here  why doesnt christy stay with me   you live with your mother  i do not  my mother lives with me  then its all settled christy will stay with howard  penny can go back to her apartment  and ill watch the last 24 minutes of doctor who  although at this point its more like doctor why bother   sheldon you just cant dictate  no more talking everybody go  so what do you say want to repair to casa wolowitz  what is that like a mexican deli  im sorry i should have mentioned this earlier  my last name is wolowitz  thats so cool  my first jew  i imagine there arent very many kosher cornhuskers  but youre still taking me shopping  anything you want  okay ill go pack my stuff  when they perfect human cloning im going to order 12 of those  cant you see shes using you  who cares last night she pulled off her blouse and i wept  i know her okay shell have sex with anyone  as long as they keep buying her things   really  yeah  if youll excuse me i have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash  im sorry we cannot do this without wolowitz  we cant order chinese food without wolowitz  let me walk you through it our standard order is  the steamed dumpling appetizer general tsos chicken  beef with broccoli shrimp with lobster sauce  and vegetable lo mein  do you see the problem  i see a problem  our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees  divided amongst four people   so well just order three entrees  fine  what do you want to eliminate and who gets the extra dumpling  we could cut it into thirds  then its no longer a dumpling once you cut it open it is  at best a very small openfaced sandwich  hi fellas  wheres your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks mandarin  hes putting his needs ahead of the collective good  where he comes from thats punishable by death  i come from sacramento  can we get an order of dumplings but with three instead of four  no substitutions  this isnt a substitution its a reduction  okay no reductions  fine bring us three orders of dumplings   thats 12 well each have four  that works  if we fill up on dumplings we need to eliminate another entree  no eliminations  if we have extra well just take the leftovers home  and divide it how im telling you we cannot do this without wolowitz  wolowitz is with his new girlfriend  if you had let me invite penny then you would have had your fourth  have you seen penny eat chinese food  she uses a fork and she doubledips her egg rolls   we dont order egg rolls  exactly  but wed have to if she was here  can we please make a decision  not only are there children starving in india  theres an indian starving right here  theres an idea why dont we just go out for indian food  youre nice boys  tell you what im going to do  im going to bring you the four dumplings  when im walking over to the table maybe i get bumped  one of the dumplings fall to the floor no one has to know  ill know   how about soup  yeah we can always divide soup  what about the wontons  hey guys whats up  its halo night  so  with wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend christy  shes not my friend friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty  right anyway uh with wolowitz occupied elsewhere  we had something we wanted to ask you  yes  we would very much appreciate it  if you would be the fourth member of our halo team  i dont think i need to tell you what an honor this is  thats so sweet but im going out dancing with a girlfriend  you cant go out its halo night   well for penny its dancing night  you go dancing every wednesday   no  then thats not dancing night  why dont i play with you guys tomorrow  tonight is halo night its like talking to a wall  all right now sheldon you and i are about to have a problem  sheldon remember we roleplayed this  yes but you didnt portray her as completely irrational  all right fellas i gotta go  but good luck  maybe we shouldve asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend  assuming we could dance which we cant  there are three of us and two of them  so  its the chinese restaurant all over again  i assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds  is childs play compared with three men  each attempting to dance with 67 of a woman  for gods sakes sheldon youre driving me crazy  your anger is not with me sir but with basic mathematics  im pretty sure my anger is with you  whats happening to us were falling apart   who are you calling  the only man who can restore  any semblance of balance to our universe  hi this is howard wolowitz  and this is christy vanderbelt  we cant get to the phone right now because were having sex  youre not going to put that on your message are you  nah im just kidding ill rerecord it  sheldon think this through youre going to ask howard to choose  between sex and halo  no im going to ask him to choose between sex and halo three  as far as i know sex has not been upgraded  to include hidef graphics and enhanced weapon systems  youre right all sex has is nudity orgasms and human contact  my point  you can take the damn plastic off the couch once in a while  why so you and howard can hump on it  ladies ladies im sure theres a middle ground  shut up howard  you guys talk im gonna take my scooter out for a little spin  you happy you drove your own son out of the house  why dont you stop  what are you doing here  its halo night  hes not a man hes a putz  and dont you take that tone with me you gold digger   whatd you call me  you heard me  and ill tell you something else youre barking up the wrong tree  cause as long as youre around howard is out of the will  you know what i got better offers im outta here  thats right go back to babylon you whore  so halo night huh  i thought she was the whore of omaha  sheldon you got him in your sights fire hes charging his plasma rifle  i cant shoot now im cloaking   raj kill sheldon  i cant see him  thats why they call it cloaking dead man   start throwing grenades  im all out  hey guys my friends and
