                you know ive been thinking about timetravel again  why did you hit a roadblock with invisibility  put it on a backburner  anyway it occurs to me  if i have ever did perfect time machine  id just go into the past and give it to myself  thats eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place  interesting  yeah it really kicks the pressure off  sounds like a breakthrough  should i call science magazine and tell them to hold the cover  its time travel i will have already done that  then i guess congratulations are in order  no congratulations will have been in order  you know i am not going to enjoy this party  i know im familiar with you  the last department party professor finkleday cornered me  and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes  yes i was there  you know whats interesting about caves   what  nothing  then well avoid him well meet the new department head  congratulate him shake his hand and go  hows this pleased to meet you dr gablehauser  how fortunate for you that the universitys  chosen to hire you despite the fact  that youve done no original research in 25 years  and instead have written a series of popular books  that reduce the great concepts of science  to a series of anecdotes  each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration  of an average bowel movement  mahalo  mahalos a nice touch  you know there only eight consonants in hawaiian language  interesting you should lead with that  oh god look at this buffet  i love america  you dont have buffets in india  of course but its all indian food  you cant find a bagel in mumbai to save your life  shmear me   heres an interesting turn of events  what  howard brought a date  a more plausible explanation is that  his work in robotics has made  an amazing leap forward  hey what up science bitches  may i introduce my  special lady friend summer   i told you touchings extra  right sorry  here comes our new boss be polite  hi fellas eric gablehauser  howard wolowitz  nice to meet you and you are  an actualrealscientist  how was that  i cant believe he fired me  well you did call him a glorified high school science teacher  whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts  in my defense  i prefaced that by saying with all due respect  season 1 episode 4 the luminous fish effect  morning  morning  youre making eggs for breakfast  this isnt breakfast its an experiment  cause it looks a lot like breakfast  i finally have time to test my hypothesis  about the separation of the water molecules  from the egg proteins and its impact visavis taste  sounds yummy  i look forward to your work with bacon  as do i  you know im sure if you just apologize  to gablehauser he would give you your job back  i dont want my job back  ive spent the past three and a half years  staring at grease boards full of equations  before that i spent four years working on my thesis  before that i was in college  and before that i was in the fifth grade  this is my first day off in decades and im going to savor it  ill let you get back to fixing your eggs  not just fixing my eggs im fixing everyones eggs  and we all thank you  use new eggs  im running out to the market you need anything  this would be one of those circumstances  that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence   im sorry  i need eggs  four dozen should suffice   four dozen  yes  and evenly distributed amongst brown white  freerange large extra large and jumbo  okay one more time  never mind you wont get it right  id better come with you  how come you didnt go into work today  im taking a sabbatical  because i wont kowtow to mediocre minds  so you got canned huh  theoretical physicists do not get canned  but yeah  maybe its all for the best  i always say when one door closes another one opens  no it doesnt  not unless the two doors are connected by relays   or there are motion sensors involved  no i meant  or if the first door closing creates a change of air pressure  that acts upon the second door  never mind  slow down   please slow down  were fine  youre not leaving yourself enough space between cars   oh sure i am  no let me do the math for you  this car weighs lets say 4000 pounds  now add 140 for me   im sorry did i insult you  is your body mass somehow tied into your selfworth  well yeah  interesting  anyway that gives us a total weight of  lets say 4400 pounds  lets say 4390  fine were traveling forward at  good lord 51 miles an hour  lets assume that your brakes  are new and the calipers are aligned  still by the time we come to a stop  well be occupying the same space as that buick in front of us  an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve  into death mutilation  oh look they built a new puttputt course  this is great  look at me  im in the real world of ordinary people  just living their ordinary colorless workaday lives  thank you  no thankyou  and thank you ordinary person  you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes  no not really  listen didnt you say you need some eggs  yes but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth  knows to pick up their refrigerated food on the way out of the supermarket  okay then maybe you should start heading on out then  no this is fun  oh the thing about tomatoes and i think youll really enjoy this  is theyre shelved with the vegetables but theyre technically a fruit   interesting  isnt it  no i mean what you find enjoyable  oh boy  what now  well theres some value to taking a multivitamin  but the human body can only absorb so much  what youre buying here  are the ingredients for very expensive urine  well maybe thats what i was going for  then youll want some manganese  that was fun  maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores  oh i dont know  its going to take me a while to recover from all the fun i had today  are you sure  there are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk  for example i noticed that you purchase your tampons  onemonth supply at a time  what  think about it its a product that doesnt spoil  and youre going to be needing them for at least the next 30 years  you want me to buy 30 years worth of tampons  well 30 35 when did your mother go into menopause  im not talking about this with you  this is a natural human process  and were talking about statistically significant savings  now if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28day cycle  are you fairly regular  okay no warehouse store  but were still on for puttputt golf right  hey i just ran into penny she seemed upset about something  i think its her time of the month  i marked the calendar for future reference  whats with the fish  its an experiment  what happened to your scrambled egg research  oh that was a dead end  scrambled eggs are as good as theyre ever going to be  so fish  i read an article about japanese scientists  who inserted dna from luminous jellyfish into other animals  and i thought hey fish nightlights  fish nightlights  its a billiondollar idea  mums the word  are you sure you dont want  to just apologize to gablehauser and get your job back  no i have too much to do  like luminous fish  im sorry i didnt  thats just the beginning  i also have an idea  for a bulk mailorder feminine hygiene company  oh glowinthedark tampons  leonard were gonna be rich  thanks for coming on such short notice   you did the right thing calling  i didnt know what else to do  hes lost all focus every day hes got a new obsession  this is a particularly disturbing one  mommy  hi baby  oh you got yourself a loom how nice  thank you  honey whyd you get a loom  i was working with luminous fish and i thought  loom  mom what are you doing here  leonard called me  i know but why  because one of the great minds of the 21st century  is raising glowinthedark fish and weaving serapes  this is not a serape this is a poncho  a serape is open at the sides a poncho is closed  this is a poncho  and neither is a reason to call someonesmother  really when was the last time you left the house  i went to the market with penny  that was three weeks ago  well then buckle up in the next four to eight days  shes going to get very crabby  sweetheart your little friend is concerned about you  yes well im not a child im a grown man  capable of living my life as i see fit  and i certainly dont need someone telling on me to my mother  wait where are you going  to my room and no ones allowed in  he gets his temper from his daddy  hes got my eyes  i see  all that science stuff that comes from jesus   sheldon your mom made dinner  im not hungry  dont trouble yourself hes stubborn  he may stay in there till the rapture  we so sure thats abadthing  i tell you i love the boy to death  but he has been difficult since he fell out of me at the kmart  excuse me for being so bold  but i now see where sheldon gets his smoldering good looks  honey that aint gonna work but you keep tryin  i made chicken  i hope that isnt one of the animals that you people think is magic  you know we have an indian gentleman at our church  a dr patel its a beautiful story  the lord spoke to him and moved him to give us all 20 off on lasik  you know those that needed it  that is a lovely story  are we gonna do anything about sheldon  oh we will you have to take your time with sheldon  his father god rest his soul used to always say to me  mary you have to take your time with sheldon   sounds like a wise man  oh not so wise  he once tried to fight a bobcat for some licorice  so everybody grab a plate  and a pretty place mat that shelly wove  has shelly ever freaked out like this before  oh all the time  i remember one summer when he was 13  he built a small nuclear reactor in the shed  and told everybody he was gonna provide free electricity for the whole town  well the only problem was  he had no what you call fissionable materials  anyway when he went on the internets to get some  a man from the government came by and sat him down  real gentle and told him its against the law  to have yellowcake uranium in a shed   what happened  well poor boy had a fit  locked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray  a death ray  thats what he called it didnt even slow down the neighbor kids  it pissed our dog off to no end  you know you two make a cute couple  no were not were notnot a couple  were singles two singles  like those individuly wrapped slices of cheese that  were friends   did i pluck a nerve there  oh yeah  all right everybody its time to eat  oh lord we thank you for this meal  and all of your bounty  and we pray that you help sheldon  get back on his rocker  now after a moment of silent meditation  im gonna end with in jesus name  but you two dont feel any obligation to join in  unless of course the holy spirit moves you  oh my god this is the best cobbler ive ever had  it was always sheldons favorite  you know what the secret ingredient is   love  lard  hey look whos come  youll spook him  hes like a baby deer you got to let him come to you  this is ridiculous damn it sheldon snap out of it  youre a physicist  you belong at the university doing research not hiding in your room  you dont hunt do you  good morning snickerdoodle  morning  well that looks awful fancy what is that  its my idea of what dna would look like  in a siliconbased lifeform  but intelligently designed by a creator right  what do you want mom  you know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long  before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water  well im done fishing  you put those on   what for  because youre gonna  go down to your office youre gonna apologize  to your boss and get your job back  no im sorry  did i start that sentence with the words  if it please your highness  im not going to apologize i didnt say anything that wasnt true  now you listen here  i have been telling you since you were four years old  its okay to be smarter than everybody  but you cant go around pointing it out   why not  because people dont like it  remember all the asskickings you got from the neighbor kids  now lets get crackin  shower shirt shoes and lets shove off  there wouldnt have been any asskickings  if that stupid death ray had worked  problem solved  really thats impressive  leonard the lord never gives us more than we can handle  thankfully he blessed me with two other children  who are dumb as soup  excuse me dr gablehauser are you busy   well actually  sheldon hes just doodlin  get in here  lets go baby were losing daylight  as you know  several weeks ago in our first encounter  we may have gotten off on the wrong foot  when i called you an idiot  and i just wanted to say that i was wrong  to point it out  im sorry we havent been introduced  sheldons mom  now thats impossible you must have had him when you were a teenager  oh arent you sweet his fathers dead   recently  long enough  please  sheldon shouldnt you be working  hey how did it go  i got my job back  really what happened  im not quite sure  it involves a part of the human experience  that has always eluded me  that narrows it down  im very proud of you honey  you showed a lot of courage today  thanks mom  is dr gablehauser going to be my new daddy  well see  sleep tight
