                penny hello  hey sheldon  what is shaking  im sorry  its colloquial a conversation opener  so do you find the weather satisfying  are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team  whats wrong with you youre freaking me out  im striking up a casual conversation with you  sup  please dont do that  all right but im given to understand that when you have something awkward  to discuss with someone  its more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat  so this wasnt the awkward part  all right  sup  oh good i used that right  anyway youre aware that leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship  which includes a sexual component  okay feeling the awkward now  her name is dr stephanie barnett  and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at freemont memorial   leonard told me  good  what he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me  to you  see of the handful of women leonards been involved with  shes the only one i have ever found tolerable  well what about me  the statement stands for itself  arent you sweet  anyway should you have any interaction with her  it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival  yeah i think shes pretty safe  you say that now but consider the following scenario  youre sitting in your apartment its late youre alone  your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone  and suddenly even leonard  seems like a viable sexual candidate  or a hookup  as its referred to by todays urban youth   really  yes now should that happen  i would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido  i could think about you  fine whatever works  always nice talking to you sheldon  peace out   subwayfr  this is very pleasant  glad youre enjoying yourself  and you said thered never be enough pasta for the three of us  i stand corrected  you know italian housewives have a rule of thumb  a handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter  is sufficient for each person  as it doubles in volume when cooked   thats very interesting  thank you  she doesnt mean it shes just being nice  well since leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball  i guess ill just have to pick it up  have you ever witnessed a violent crime   no  good  whats your favorite fruit  strawberries  technically not a fruit but all right  where did you do your medical internship  lawrence memorial in galveston texas  really thats where i was born  youre kidding  i spent so much of my childhood at that hospital  when i was 12 i got to ride there in a helicopter   why what happened  radiation burns  a little mishap while i was building my own cat scanner  im sorry you tried to build your own cat scanner  no i didnt try i succeeded  in fact i was briefly able to see the inside  of my sisters guinea pig snowball before he caught fire  it led to an interesting expression in our house  not a snowballs chance in a cat scanner  excuse me  when i come back just for fun  the subject will be alternative history  specifically how would the civil war have gone differently  if lincoln had been a robot sent from the future  look at that theres even pasta left over  do you understand that this was supposed to be a date  i do do you because frankly  youve been in a foul mood since i sat down  okay heres my question why did you sit down  to help look if you fail at this relationship  and history suggests you will  then we risk losing the medical officer  that our landing party has always needed  what landing party  youre kirk im spock wolowitz is scotty  koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed  and now weve got mccoy  so were all standing around looking at the postop x ray  and there it is clear as day right in the guys chest cavity  one of my earrings  oh my god what did you do  what do you think i did  i discreetly slipped off the other earring  put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there  i have a bone to pick with you sir  hi sheldon  hi stephanie im sorry im late  but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation  what invitation  were going to the movies  what movie what theater what time  if you were trying to make it impossible to locate you  you couldnt have done a better job  clearly i could have  it took me nearly 20 minutes to browse the history on your computer  to see what movie times you looked up  wait here ill find us seats   we have seats  not the right seats  what is he doing  hes finding the acoustic sweet spot  does he always do this  sometimes he brings a toy xylophone  i am really sorry about this  no its fine you know hes sweet  my apologies youve been sitting in it all along   you want to slide over one  no just sit here  oh yeah this is it  what sheldon  what sheldon what sheldon  tell me what you see here  the blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial  this is stephanies facebook page  now where it should say in a relationship what does it say  stephanie barnett is single  furthermore earlier this evening  she threw a digital sheep at some guy named mike  whos mike  why does he get a digital sheep and not you  its just her facebook page  and weve only been going out a couple of weeks  you dont see it do you were losing her  im going to make this very simple for you  you are not in this relationship  i am  ergo you have no say  in anything that happens between me and stephanie  im afraid i cant allow that  pursuant to starfleet general order 104  section a you are deemed unfit  and i hereby relieve you of your command  general order 104 section a does not apply in this situation   give me one good reason why not  because this is not star trek  what  this is banana bread  this is a door knob  its my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food  can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation  to come in and chat  would you like to come in  i suppose i could spare a few minutes  were you robbed  how can you be sure  what do you want  im certain this will come as no surprise to you  but leonard is failing in yet another relationship   hes having problems with stephanie  shes sending virtual livestock  to random men on the internet  if i have any hope of keeping them together i need data  specifically i need to know exactly what leonard did  that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks   what  again urban slang  in which i believe im gaining remarkable fluency  so what is the down and the low  and dont worry this is all entirely confidential  so you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom  we never got to the bedroom  because  all right you know what ill tell you what happened  we were young  we were very much in love  but we could only communicate  through a timetraveling mailbox at my lake house  its not enough that you made me watch that movie  but now you mock me with it  gentlemen i have a question  about dating and relationships  you told me you were going to have the talk with him  ive been waiting for someone to have the talk with me  more to the point its about finding a way  to keep leonard and stephanie together  i dont think you can  why not  look at leonards record  during which she defected to north korea  two booty calls with leslie winkle  for which she awarded him the nickname speed of light leonard   and the three hour dinner with penny  which would have been two and a half  if they ordered the souffle when they sat down  based on the geometric progression  his relationship with stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes  yes im aware of the math y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth  the issue remains  how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection  if you want to guarantee his appeal to stephanie  your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet  heres what you shouldnt do dont shpritz him with that body spray  from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it  that doesnt work at all  no matter how much you put on  thats all youve got apocalyptic genocide  and go easy on the cologne  what  zucchini bread   thank you  may i come in  i see  apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and leonard  crossed some sort of line  i apologize  well thank you  have you and i returned to a social equilibrium   yes  great  new topic  where are you in your menstrual cycle  what  ive been doing some research online and apparently female primates  you know apes chimpanzees you  they find their mate more desirable when hes courted by another female  now this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting  the pheromones associated with ovulation  which brings me back to my question where are you  clearly im 14 days too early  all im saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria  why cant they do something about lactose intolerance  leonard youre going to have to let this go  you had a little cheese dip you farted i thought it was cute   you want some more wine  yeah i mean  i assume im not driving anywhere tonight  what are you doing  i have a craving for white asparagus  that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied  excuse me   what is wrong with you  im helping you with stephanie  by making constipated moose sounds  when i fail to open this jar and you succeed  it will establish you as the alpha male  you see when a female  witnesses an exhibition of physical domination  she produces the hormone oxytocin  if the two of you then engage in intercourse  this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain  which lay people naively interpret as falling in love  would it work if i just punched you in the face  yes actually it would but lets see how the lid goes  im not strong enough leonard youll have to do it   for gods sakes  go ahead its preloosened  you want some help with that  i got it  hes got it and thats not surprising  its something i long ago came to peace with  in my role as the beta male  open it   are you okay  no im not   im bleeding  like a gladiator   honey youre going to need stitches  stitches with a needle  well yeah i mean just a few  yeah hang on a sec  fyi i was defrosting a steak in there  what a beautiful job stephanie did  i might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch  but you cant argue with her results  its a shame it wont scar  the war wound is a timehonored badge of masculinity  i cant remember a time when you werent talking  just for the record my efforts to establish you as the alpha male  were not aided by you bursting into tears  i did not burst into tears  my eyes just got a little watery  watery  she stuck a needle into my hand  hey hows my big cry baby  i didnt cry  im just teasing you  but yeah you did  its all good what do you say we get you home and put you to bed  are you still going to spend the night  no i think that you probably need to rest  shes right as long as youre vomiting coitus is contraindicated  thank you dr cooper  youre welcome dr hofstadter  okay im going to go get your discharge papers  what  you seem like a perfectly pleasant person  i cant understand why women have such a hard time loving you  can you open this for me   can i see your stitches  sure  answering the question once and for all  why wolowitz bailed out of medical school   leonard congratulations  what for  your facebook status update  leonard hofstadter is in a relationship  what no thats not right  oh man did you switch your status before she did  speaking as an expert way to look needy  seriously you went first after only two weeks  thats bold  its not bold its a mistake  i didnt change my status  well then who did  i had no choice he cried in front of her  you hacked my facebook account  its hardly hacking  when you use the same password for everything kalel  are you insane now shes going to think im desperate  youve destroyed this relationship and you know what the worst part is  you dont even understand what you did wrong  because you cant conceive of something that you are not an expert in   in which i am not an expert  dont even  i dont want to hear another word out of you  whats wrong lassie timmy fall down the well  she just updated her facebook status  stephanie barnett is in a relationship  with leonard hofstadter  really  look at that  i have a girlfriend  if i am permitted to speak again  dr sheldon cooper for the win
