                oh look saturn 3 is on  i dont want to watch saturn 3 deep space nine is better  how is deep space nine better than saturn 3  simple subtraction will tell you its six better  compromise watch babylon 5  in what sense is that a compromise  well five is partway between three never mind  ill tell you what how about we go rockpaperscissors  i dont think so  anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rockpaperscissors  players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80 of the time  due to the limited number of outcomes  i suggest rockpaperscissorslizardspock   what  its very simple  scissors cuts paper paper covers rock  rock crushes lizard lizard poisons spock  spock smashes scissors scissors decapitates lizard  lizard eats paper paper disproves spock  spock vaporizes rock  and as it always has rock crushes scissors  okay i think i got it  rockpaperscissorslizardspock  hello boys  ahoy matey  noticed the eye patch did you  its all part of a technique ive been studying for picking up women  you employ a visual display  designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable  oh yes like the male peacock with brilliant plumage  or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters  or in this case the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye  mock me if you will but it works  you show up at a club in something distinctive  scope out your target and toss out some negs   what are negs  a neg is a negative compliment  that throws a pretty woman off her game  like normally im not turned on by big teeth  but on you they work  i got a whole list of em who wants to be my wingman  youre not gonna need a wingman youre gonna need a paramedic  your scooters blocking my car  did you get pinkeye again  step one she notices the eye patch  may i say penny  not a lot of women could look as hot as you do  with such greasy hair  just move your stupid scooter  before i pick it up and throw it in the dumpster   subwayfr  im sorry but im not going to watch the clone wars tv series  until ive seen the clone wars movie  i prefer to let george lucas disappoint me in the order he intended  i want to watch it now  then i believe weve arrived at another quintessential  rockpaperscissors lizardspock moment  watch whatever you want  i saw what you did there  whatd i do  whats wrong   okay well be right there  what happened  howards at the mars rover lab he says hes in trouble  defcon 5  defcon 5  well theres no need to rush   what  defcon 5 means no danger  defcon 1 is a crisis  how can 5 not be worse than 1  star trek v worse than i  first of all thats a comparison of quality not intensity  secondly star trek i is ordersofmagnitude worse  than star trek v  are you joking star trek v is the standard  against which all badness is measured  no no  star trek v has specific failures in writing and direction  while star trek i fails across the board  art direction costuming music sound editing  can we just forget i said defcon and go  star trek v  will you at least stipulate  that star trek iv the voyage home is inarguably the best  i have three words for you wrath of khan   thank god youre here  whats the emergency  i got the mars rover stuck in a ditch  where  on a dusty highway just outside bakersfield  where do you think on mars  is everything okay  yeah baby ill be right in  you brought a girl to the mars rover control room  yeah i picked her up in the bar shes a doctor  one free barium enema  and my mother wont care shes not jewish  wait a minute so the eye patch and the insults worked  no there were three other guys with eye patches it was a fiasco  what did work was howd you like to visit a secret government facility  so what exactly do you want us to do  you and raj help me get the rover out of the ditch  and you get stephanie out before somebody notices her   she doesnt exactly have clearance  really  they dont let strange women from honkytonks  come in and play with 200 million government projects on distant planets  yes i was bad maybe shell spank me  can we please move on  its getting late so do i get to drive this thing or what  no im sorry but somethings come up  kind of a mars rover  mars rover can howard come over  situation  so my friend leonard is gonna take you home  okay lets go friend leonard   ill call ya  so are you a scientist like howard  no ones a scientist like howard  my mother is so gonna love her  how nice maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison  im sorry i totally interrupted you  what were you saying  just said howards a terrific guy  hes got a great sense of humor  he loves his mother  a lot  people say too much  i really like that youre such a loyal friend  yeah i am loyal  if you look at the big picture  out of curiosity did he ever have a shot with you  are you insane the guy was wearing an eye patch  then why did you  he said that i could drive a car on mars  got it  so can i see you again  youre not gonna see me now  cool  anything  actually i was just checking my email  but no the rover is not responding  i believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement  and a native american water vessel without any means of propulsion  hang on theres got to be other options  you could try calling triplea  but based on nasas latest timetable they wont get there for 35 years  plus i understand you have to be standing  next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive  oh snap  snap what   i guess we have to turn to plan b  whats plan b  erase hard drives scrap surveillance tapes  wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run  why wasnt that plan a  a nasa spokesman states that due to the loss of data  they will most likely be unable to determine the cause  of the mars rovers malfunction  thank god for plan b  didnt you say you worked on the mars rover  no youre mistaken  when we first met  you said that if i went out with you i could drive a car on mars  i dont know what youre talking about  will you all excuse me leonard is subtly signaling  that hed like to talk to me in private  no i remember specifically  you started by asking if i was from mars  because my ass was out of this world  that does sound like me but no  is there some problem  listen i have to kinda sneak out for a while   all right goodbye  no wait  if anyone asks you where i went you dont know   where are you going  i cant tell you that  who would ask me  i cant tell you that either  you brought me in here to inform me you cant tell me where youre going  and you cant tell me who might ask  yeah i really didnt think this through   leonard a moment  what  if someone and of course we dont know who this would be  does ask where youve gone what should i say  i dont know just tell em i went to the office   are you going to the office  no  then how can i say it convincingly  just say leonard went to the office  all right leonard went to the office  what is no not like that   just leonard went to the office  it wouldve worked out a lot better  if youd just told me you were going to the office  im going to the office  see why dont i believe you  im going out for a while  doesnt anyone want to know where hes going  okay where is he going  leonard is going to the office   so how was work today  busy  i removed an appendix a gall bladder  and about a foot and a half of bowel  im hoping that was three different guys  no just the

absolutely  thanks for calling  you have a nice day too  you are dead to me  who gets the extra dumpling  rockpaperscissorslizardspock  okay one of us is going to have to stop putting up spock  how do we decide that   hey guys  hello  hi howard  howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm  in which you are for all intents and purposes deceased  he intends to act on this by not speaking to you  feigning an inability to hear you when you speak  and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence  thats just ridiculous why are you cooperating with him  i dont make the rules leonard  howard come on i didnt plan on this  these things just happen  usually not to me but they do happen  did someone just feel a cold breeze  i believe this is an extension of the death metaphor  the cold breeze is the socalled ectoplasmic issue  of a disembodied soul passing by  screw it im just gonna eat the dumpling   come on in  is this a bad time  yes but i dont see a better one on the horizon  if it isnt mrs dead to me  im sorry you violated the terms of your metaphor  by acknowledging her existence im out  he just wont listen to me  okay i guess itll just be the three of us then  lisas gonna be disappointed  lisa  my roommate she just went through a really bad breakup  i thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you  leonard stephanie youre alive  its a miracle  so anyway lisa i just wanted to tell you again  how much i enjoyed the other night  and again im sorry for how it ended  but again if you could let me know about friday  my mother needs a head count  so she can know how big a brisket to get  howard look at this  anyway call me  its howard  its unclear how the mars rover got into the crevice  but one things certain  the data which it has sent back  contain the first clear indications  that there may have been life on mars  its a scientific discovery  that has staggering implications for all mankind  unfortunately well never know whos responsible  son of a bitch
