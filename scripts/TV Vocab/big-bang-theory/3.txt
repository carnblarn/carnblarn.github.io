                alright just a few more feet  and here we are gentlemen  the gates of elzebob  good lord  dont panic this is what the last 97 hours have been about  stay frosty theres a horde of armed goblins  on the other side of that gate guarding the sword of asaroth  warriors unsheathe your weapons magic wielders raise your wands  lock and load  raj blow the gates  blowing the gates  control  shift b  oh my god so many goblins  dont just stand there slash and move  stay in formation  leonard you got one on your tail  my tails prehensile ill swat him off  i got him leonard  tonight i spice my mead with goblin blood  raj no its a trap theyre flanking us  hes got me  sheldon hes got raj use your sleep spell  ive got the sword of asaroth  forget the sword help raj  there is no more sheldon i am the sword master   leonard look out  damn it man were dying here  goodbye peasants  the bastard teleported  hes selling the sword of asaroth on ebay  you betrayed us for money who are you  im a rogue night elf  dont you people read character descriptions  wait wait somebody just clicked buy it now  i am the sword master   sweety  anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming  i just built a virtual pool  no i cant look at you or your avatar right now  sounds like your neighbors home  excuse me  dont forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose  as an excuse to talk to her  oh right right right  stealing snail mail very old school i like it  penny the mailman did it again  sorry  hi leonard this is doug  doug this is my neighbor leonard  whats up bro  not much  bro  is everything okay  yeah no i just i got your mail again here  thank you ive got to talk to that mailman  oh no thats probably not such a good idea  civil servants have a documented propensity  to you know snap so  okay well thank you again  no problem bye  oh and bye bro  penny for your thoughts  whats the matter  im fine  pennys fine the guy shes kissing is really fine  kissing what kind of kissing cheeks lips chaste french  what is wrong with you  im a romantic  dont tell me that your hopeless infatuation  is devolving into pointless jealousy  im not jealous im just a little concerned for her  i didnt like the look of the guy  because he looks better than you  he was kind of dreamy  at least now you can retrieve the black box  from the twisted smoldering wreckage  that was once your fantasy of dating her  and analyze the data so that you dont crash  into geek mountain again  i disagree  love is not a sprint its a marathon  a relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms  or hits you with the pepper spray  im done with penny  im going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed   like who  i dont know  olivia geiger  the dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye  i dont think you have a shot there  i have noticed that leslie winkle recently started shaving her legs  now given that winter is coming  one can only assume shes signaling sexual availability  i dont know you guys work in the same lab   so  there are pitfalls  trust me i know  when it comes to sexual harassment law  im a bit of a selftaught expert  if i were to ask leslie winkle out  it would just be for dinner im not going to walk into the lab  ask her to strip naked and dance for me  oh then youre probably okay   hello leslie  hi leonard  id like to propose an experiment   goggles leonard  right  i would like to propose an experiment  hang on  im trying to see how long it takes a 500kilowatt  oxygen iodine laser to heat up my cup a noodles  ive done it about two seconds  anyway i was thinking more  of a biosocial exploration with a neurochemical overlay  wait are you asking me out  i was going to characterize it as the modification  of our colleagueslashfriendship paradigm  with the addition of a datelike component  but we dont need to quibble over terminology  what sort of experiment  theres a generally accepted pattern in this area  i would pick you up take you to a restaurant  then we would see a movie probably a romantic comedy  featuring the talents of hugh grant or sandra bullock  interesting and would you agree  that the primary way we would evaluate either the success  or failure of the date would be  based on the biochemical reaction during the good night kiss  heart rate pheromones etc yes  why dont we just stipulate that the date goes well  and move to the key variable   you mean kiss you now  yes  can you define the parameters of the kiss  closemouthed but romantic mint  thank you  i count down from three  no i think it needs to be spontaneous   what do you think  you proposed the experiment  i think you should present your findings first  fair enough  on the plus side it was a good kiss  reasonable technique no extraneous spittle  on the other hand no arousal   none  none   thank you for your time  thank you  none at all  sheldon if you were a robot  and i knew and you didnt  would you want me to tell you  that depends  when  i learn that im a robot  will i be able to handle it  maybe although the history of science fiction is not on your side  okay let me ask you this  when i learn that im a robot  would i be bound by asimovs three laws of robotics  you might be bound by them right now  thats true have you ever harmed a human being  or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm   of course not  have you ever harmed yourself  or allowed yourself to be harmed  except in cases where a human being would have been endangered   well no  i smell robot  hey whats going on  internets been down for half an hour  also sheldon may be a robot  so howd it go with leslie  oh we tried kissing but the earth didnt move  i mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway  oh ive seen that look before  this is just going to be two weeks of moping  and tedious emo songs  and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats  i dont know if i can take it  you could power down  as usual wolowitz has the solution  i happen to know a place  where there are plenty of eligible women and leonard could have his pick  remember the latin hips  shoulders stay still and we sway  one two three  five six seven  i think mrs tishmans got her eye on you  ive been there youre in for a treat  oh good lord  god thats a good song  if youre compiling a mix cd for a double suicide  oh i hope that scratching post is for you  i know what youre thinking ive taken your asthma into account  theres a feline geneticist in san diego  whos developed the cutest little hypoallergenic calicos   listen to me  ive been thinking about names  im kind of torn between einstein newton  and sergeant fuzzy boots  do you really think you can satisfy your need  for a relationship with a genetically altered cat  maybe  if its a cute little cuddly cat  oh come on leonard  this is obviously about penny  it doesnt matter  the womans not interested in me the woman rejected me  look  i think that you have as much of a chance  of having a sexual relationship with penny  as the hubble telescope does of discovering  at the center of every black hole  is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker  nevertheless  i do feel obligated to point out to you  that she did not reject you  you did not ask her out  youre right  i didnt ask her out i should ask her out  no no that was not my point  my point was dont buy a cat  no but youre right  i should march over there and ask her out  oh goody were getting a cat  good afternoon penny so hi hey  i was wondering if you had plans for dinner  you mean dinner tonight  there is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner  technically it refers  to the largest meal of the day whenever its consumed  so to clarify here by dinner i mean supper   supper  or dinner  i was thinking 630 if you can go or a different time   really   great  i like hanging out with you guys  us guys  yeah you know sheldon howard raj who alls coming  they  might all be there  or a subset of them might be there  algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns  for example sheldon had quiznos for lunch  sometimes he finds that filling other times he doesnt  its no fault of quiznos they have a varied menu  okay whatever it sounds like fun  great   did we say a time  630   and thats still good  its fine   cause its not carved in stone  no 630s great  ill get my chisel  why  to carve the ill see you at 630  how do i look  could you be more specific  can you tell im perspiring a little  no the dark crescentshaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely   what time is your date  630  perfect that gives you  two hours and 15 minutes for that dense molecular cloud  of aramis to dissipate  is it too much  not if youre a rugby team  if it should ever come up  you didnt join us because you stuffed yourself  with a chicken carbonara sub at quiznos  why would i join you  no reason  you know what maybe this isnt such a good idea  no well now theres always the possibility  that alcohol and poor judgment on her part  might lead to a nice romantic evening  youre right alcohol poor judgment it could go well  there is the other possibility  that  this date kicks off a rather unpleasant 6 months  of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall  until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code  you couldve stopped at it could go well  if i couldve i wouldve  i mean im a perfectly nice guy  theres no reason we couldnt go and have a lovely dinner  maybe take a walk afterwards  talk about things we have in common  you love pottery i love pottery  theres a pause  we both know whats happening i lean in we kiss  its a little tentative at first but then i realize  shes kissing me back shes biting my lower lip  she wants me this thing is going the distance  were going to have sex oh god oh my god  is the sex starting now  im having a panic attack  well then calm down  if i could i wouldnt be having a panic  thats why they call it a panic attack  sit down  yeah sit down now close your eyes   why  just do it  now try to increase your alpha wave activity   what  its a biofeedback technique  its relaxation through brain wave manipulation  i read a paper about it in journal of american neuroscience  it was a little sparsely sourced but i think the basic science is valid  i probably have it here somewhere  who am i kidding i cant go through with this  you need to call her and cancel   me  yes   what should i tell her  i dont know tell her im sick  not an illness that will make her want to take care of me  but nothing so critical that shell feel uncomfortable  going out with me if i want to try this again  got it so im assuming nothing venereal  ill just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy  and havent quite bounced back   give me the phone  i thought you wanted to cancel  i cant because if i dont show up shell still be expecting you  why would she be expecting me  stop asking me all these questions  i need to take another shower  so are the rest of the guys meeting us here  oh yeah no  it turns out that raj and howard had to work and sheldon  had a colonoscopy and he hasnt quite bounced back yet  my uncle just had a colonoscopy  youre kidding  then thats something we have in common  how  we both have people in our lives who  want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud  so whats new in the world of physics  nothing  really nothing  well with the exception of string theory  not much has happened since the 1930s  and you cant prove string theory  at best you can say  hey look my idea has an internal logical consistency  well im sure things will pick up  whats new at the cheesecake factory  not much  we do have a chocolate key lime thats moving pretty well  good  good  what about your  hallway friend  doug oh yeah i dont know  i mean you know hes nice and funny but  can i get you started with some drinks   you were saying but  id like a drink  just say the but thing about doug and then ill get her back  i dont know its just me  im still getting over this breakup with kurt  and this thing with doug would just be rebound sex  dont get me started on rebound sex  its just its my pattern  i break up then i find some cute guy  and then its just 36 meaningless hours of  you know  im not sure that i do  is that one 36hour experience  or is that 36 hours spread out over say  one glorious summer  no its usually over a weekend  and trust me you do not feel good after it  well chafing right  emotionally  of course yeah emotional chafing  do you want to see something cool  i can make this olive go into this glass  without touching it   how  physics  centrifugal force  actually its centripetal force  which is an inward force generated by the glass  acting on the olive  excuse me  if you were riding on the olive  youd be in a noninertial reference frame  and would   are you okay  yeah im okay  did you spill ketchup   no  im not okay  you sure you dont want to go to the emergency room  no im okay it stopped bleeding  i know but you did throw up isnt that a sign of a concussion  yes but i get car sick too so  sorry about your car by the way  its fine you got most of it out the window  the poor guy on the bike  i had a nice time  yeah me too  well um good night  good night  was this supposed to be a date  this  no  of course not this was just you and me  hanging out with a bunch of guys who didnt show up  cause of work and a colonoscopy  okay i was just checking  when i take a girl on a date  and i do  she knows shes been dated  capital d  boldface underlined dated  i think i might have a little concussion  im gonna go lie down for a while good night  so how was your date  awesome  score 1 for liquor and poor jugement
