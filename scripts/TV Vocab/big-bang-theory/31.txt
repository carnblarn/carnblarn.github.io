                the problem appears to be unsolvable  maybe we could run some computer simulations  there are too many variables it would take forever  weve got to be missing something  lets start again  the movie is playing here at 720 here at 740  here at 810 and here at 845  these theaters have to be eliminated  why theyre stateoftheart digital projection 20channel surround sound  yes but they have no icee machines  despite my aggressive letterwriting campaign i might add  what about the multiplex here the seats are terrific  they have twizzlers instead of red vines  no amount of lumbar support can compensate for that  its gonna take at least an hour to eat  and i dont see a sheldonapproved restaurant  proximate to a sheldonapproved theater   we could eat after the movie  unacceptable  the delay would result in tomorrows bowel movement occurring at work  hang on hang on theres a 7eleven here  we smuggle slurpees which are essentially icees  in under our coats  after having a pleasant meal either here here or here  i dont see how we missed that  excuse me in what universe are slurpees icees  thats how we missed it  sheldon would you be prepared on a nonprecedential basis  to create an emergency ad hoc slurpeeicee equivalency  you know i cant do that  i guess we only have one option  i dont see any way around it   bye sheldon  see ya  theyre right it was the only option   subwayfr  shut the door   why  just do it   get inside and shut the door  well you didnt specify   is leonard around  he went to the movies without me  it was the only option  im sorry i dont understand which social situation this is  could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed  the building managers showing an apartment downstairs   and i havent paid my rent  oh i see  im not sure im comfortable harboring a fugitive  from the 2311 north los robles corporation  its no big deal im just a little behind on my bills  because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down  if you recall i pointed out the check engine light  to you several months ago  the check engine light is fine  its still blinking away  its the stupid engine that stopped working  it cost me like 1200 to fix it  it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money  yes it occurs to me too  hang on a moment  here take some  pay me back when you can   you got a lot of money in there  thats why its guarded by snakes   take some  dont be silly  im never silly   here  no i cant  dont you need money   yeah but  this is money im not using  but what if you need it  my expenses account for 469 of my aftertax income  the rest is divvied up between a small savings account  this deceptive container of peanut brittle  and the hollowedout buttocks of a superhero action figure  who shall remain nameless for his own protection  or her own protection   take some  really i mean are you sure  i see no large upcoming expenditures  unless they develop an affordable technology  to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like wolverine  are they working on that  i sincerely hope so  well thank you  no i cant  honey i dont want things to be weird between us  wont it also be weird if i have to say hello to you  every morning on my way to work and youre living in a refrigerator box  and washing your hair with rain water   ill pay you back as soon as i can  of course you will  its impossible to pay me back sooner than you can  assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality  im regretting this already  ive given the matter some thought and  i think id be willing to be a house pet to a race of superintelligent aliens  interesting  ask me why  do i have to  of course thats how you move a conversation forward  why  the learning opportunities would be abundant  additionally i like having my belly scratched   hey penny how was work  great  i hope im a waitress at the cheesecake factory for my whole life  was that sarcasm  was that sarcasm   was that sar  stop it   you appear to have a package here  oh thanks  this must be the beret i ordered  a couple of months ago it was backordered  did you know the beret is an example  of a piece of womens fashion adapted from male military uniforms  another fascinating example is the epaulet  hes not lying he does find that fascinating  whatever its not like im running up and down the streets  just buying myself berets  i bought one a month ago and it was backordered   look it finally arrived all right  all right  oh my god would you just get off my case   weird  good that was an unusual interaction  i wasnt sure   did you guys have an argument  no  you clearly did something to aggravate her  im at a loss  if you like you can review my daily log of social interactions  and see if theres a blunder i overlooked  here you go  you owe me another two dollars the price of moo shu pork went up  its getting tougher and tougher to be a bad jew  here you go penny shrimp with lobster sauce   thank you whats my share  dont worry about it its my treat  really how much  whatever 10 11  which is it 10 or 11  1450 but its no biggie  youll get the next one  what  he was just wondering if he wore skintight jeans and a tank top  if hed get his shrimp lo mein for free  what are you saying that im using my body to get dinner  that im some kind of chinese food prostitute  yeah raj what are you saying  let me tell you something i pay my own way in this world okay  i dont rely on anybody  what was that about  he has a nervous bladder when hes stressed out  kind of like a puppy  here leonard 10 11 12 14  it was 1450 but its okay  oh good dinners here  yes and im having some im having takeout food  youre damn right its okay ive been having leftovers at the restaurant  for like four days and i wanted something different so sue me  forgive me but that would be  the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit  i will pay you back as soon as i can you just have to give me more time   you lent her money  she need money  you seem under pressure  did i not lend you a sufficient amount because i can give you more  you know you would just love that wouldnt you  you would just love to open up your little snake can  and throw some money at the girl who cant pay her bills   where are you going  going home  where i wont be interrogated like a criminal  i forgot my fortune cookie  in case either of you have larceny in your heart  you should know that ive moved my money out of the snake can  but if youre ever short theres always a couple of 50s in green lanterns ass   hey  hey  a little mood lighting huh  when i didnt pay my bill  the department of water and power thought i would enjoy the ambience  yeah theyre very considerate that way  i used sheldons money to pay my rent then i had like 14 left over  14 huh  put it back in your pocket or ill find some other place to put it  back in the pocket it goes  you do understand  sheldon really doesnt care when he gets the money back  its actually one of the few idiosyncrasies  that doesnt make you want to kill him  yeah well thats not really my big problem  so youre a little behind on your bills everybody gets behind on their bills  i know its just this wasnt the plan  it wasnt supposed to go this way  what was the plan  waitress for six months and then become a movie star   was there a plan b  tv star  its probably not as bad as you think lets take a look  maybe we can find some corners to cut  heres something  if you dont have electricity then you probably dont need cable  just a suggestion  170 dollars for acting classes  no i cant give up my acting classes im a professional actress  youve had an acting job where you got paid  that is not the definition of professional  actually it kind of lets keep looking  whats 1800 to the los angeles county superior court  thats nothing  nothing  it sounds like you got caught speeding going 4000 miles an hour  remember kurt  your exboyfriend  he got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car   what  he was drunk  i would hope so  he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant  so i you know i paid his fines   did he pay you back  no but he will  and thats based on the inherent creditworthiness of people  who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles  leonard im not gonna call up kurt and ask him for money   what are you gonna do  i dont know  but i may have to find a cheaper place to live  you dont want to do that  why not  moving is a big deal  you have to go to the supermarket and get boxes  and if theyre not clean your books smell like melons  and its like  why dont you just get a roommate and stay here  do you know anybody  im sure the guy living with sheldon wouldnt mind moving in with you  leonard honey if we started living together  i wouldnt be able to keep my hands off you  really  and you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money  this moo shu porks burning a hole through my duodenum  leviticus 113  only that which parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud  among the beasts shall ye eat  do i mock you with the bhagavadgita  every time you scarf down a whopper   whats going on  were on a quest  through the valley of fire to acquire the sacred crown  you want the valley of fire its right here  you guys want to go on a real live quest  outside i just made cocoa   come on itll be fun  what is it  do you

not recall the last time we visited this gentleman  we returned home without pants   i do  are you sure  because your proposal suggests that you dont   im not afraid of him  all right  leonard fairly calls the question  who is in favor of abandoning our game  and confronting pennys steroidinfused exboyfriend  in a suicidal mission to extract money from him  say hi to kurt for us  excuse me  when frodo left the shire to take the one ring to mordor  didnt samwise pippin and merry go with him   they did  well  they had a terrible time of it  plus no one stole their pants  fine  enjoy your little game ill make this quest on my own  wait  take a jacket its shpritzing a little  you guys suck  come on please hes so big  is everyone clear on the plan  koothrappalis going to wet himself  im gonna throw up sheldons gonna run away  and youre going to die  shall we synchronize our watches  guys there are four of us and one of him  which means his triumph will be even larger  minstrels will write songs about him  how about this ill do the talking  you just stand behind me and try to look formidable  i shouldve peed before we left   hi kurt  lenny right  i dont really go by lenny but thats okay  you remember sheldon howard and raj   what do you want  you dont remember me   how could he not rember me  not now  i remember him  here it is  pennys in kind of a financial jam and the money that you owe her  would go a long way to solving her problems  she sent you to get it from me  no no shes too proud to ask for the money  i on the other hand feel you should honor your debt  you do  feel is a kind of a its a strong word  i just think it would be a nice gesture on your part  shell get it when she gets it  well there you go problem solved  a successful quest now lets go find a gas station with a clean bathroom  no the problem isnt solved   he just blew us off  ive got it  he didnt remember me because the last time we met  i was in a halloween costume  come on leonard lets go  you can leave if you want to im gonna see this through  i guess technically that was my fault  im not leaving here without pennys money  what happened to your backup  i dont need backup  i have right on my side  and im wearing cargo shorts under my pants  congratulations  you may not have succeed in getting cash  but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt  maybe we should have your head notarized  if anybody cares i still have to pee   is sheldon here  hang on  nice hat  its kind of a fashionable look these days  maybe if youre working on a tuna boat   hello penny  sheldon here is your money  thank you very much it helped a lot  sarcasm  darn i cant seem to get the hang of that  i know its none of my business but where did the money come from  well i cut back my expenses like you said  and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant  but the biggest thing was out of the blue kurt shows up  and gives me the money he owes me  really  did he say why  he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right  thats it  did he give any reason as to why he came  to this moral epiphany  i just think hes really changed  were having dinner tomorrow night and i get to wear my new beret  bye guys  well done leonard  the true hero doesnt seek adulation  he fights for right and justice simply because its his nature  pennys hooking up with her jerk of an exboyfriend  and i have indelible ink on my forehead  thats your badge of honor your warriors wound if you will  i was wrong  minstrels will write songs about you  great  there once was a brave lad named leonard  with a fifi fiddle deedee  he faced a fearsome giant  while raj just wanted to pee
