                more details about the new star trek film  theres going to be a scene depicting spocks birth  id be more interested in a scene depicting spocks conception  oh please  for vulcans mating or if you will ponfahr   its an extremely private matter  still id like to know the details  his mother was human his father is vulcan   they couldnt just conceive  maybe they had to go to a clinic  can you imagine spocks dad in a little room  with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears  how come on star trek everybodys private parts are the same  no alien lady ever told captain kirk hey get your thing out of my nose  hi can you help me  i was writing an email and the a key got stuck  now its just going aaa   whatd you spill on it  nothing  diet coke  and yogurt  and a little nail polish  ill take a look at it  gentlemen switching to local nerd news  fishman chen chaudury and mcnair arent fielding a team  in the university physics bowl this year  youre kidding why not  they formed a barbershop quartet and got a gig  playing knotts berry farm  so in your world  youre like the cool guys  recognize  this is our year with those guys out  the entire physics bowl will kneel before zod  zod  kryptonian villain long story  good story   count me out  what why  you want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition  would you ask picasso to play pictionary  would you ask noah webster to play boggle  would you ask jacques cousteau to play go fish  come on you need a fourperson team were four people  by that reasoning we should also play bridge hold up a chuppah  and enter the olympic bobsled competition  tickets to that please  sheldon what do i need to quote spocks dying words to you  no dont  the needs of the many   outweigh the needs of the few  or the one  damn it ill do it  season 1 episode 13 the bat jar conjecture  first order of physics bowl business  we need a truly kickass team name suggestions  how about the perpetual motion squad  its beyond the laws of physics plus a little headsup for the ladies  the ladies  perpetual motion squad we can go all night   i like it  i dont  teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures  thus intimidating ones opponent   then we could be the bengal tigers  poor choice  gram for gram no animal exceeds  the relative fighting strength of the army ant  maybe so  but you cant incinerate a bengal tiger with a magnifying glass  lets put it to a vote all those in favor  point of order  i move that any vote on team names must be unanimous  no man should be forced to emblazon his chest with a bengal tiger  when common sense dictates it should be an army ant  will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question  i will yield  after we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes  all of which the gentleman will lose does he then intend to threaten to quit   if he does not get his way  he does  i move we are the army ants all those in favor  good afternoon and welcome to todays physics bowl practice round  im penny and ill be your host  because apparently i didnt have anything else to do  on a saturday afternoon and isnt that just a little sad  gentlemen ready   yes  fire away  its none of my business but isnt a guy  who cant speak in front of women gonna hold you back a little  hell be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd  he only has a problem when theyre oneonone and smell nice  thanks raj its vanilla oil  i was actually the one who noticed okay lets just start  okay the first question is on the topic of optics  what is the shortest light pulse ever produced   dr cooper  and of course  the answer is 130 attoseconds   that is correct  i knew that too  good for you sweetie okay next question  what is the quantum mechanical effect  used to encode data on harddisk drives  and of course the answer is giant magnetoresistance   right  hey i buzzed in  and i answered its called teamwork  dont you think i should answer the engineering questions  i am an engineer  by that logic i should answer all the anthropology questions  because im a mammal  just ask another one  what artificial satellite has seen glimpses  of einsteins predicted frame dragging  and of course its gravity probe b  sheldon you have to let somebody else answer  why  because its polite  what do manners have to do with it  this is war  were the romans polite when they salted the ground of carthage  to make sure nothing would ever grow again  leonard you said i only had to ask questions  the objective of the competion is to give correct answers  if i know them why shouldnt i give them  some of us might have the correct answers too  oh please you dont even have a phd   all right thats it  howard sit down   maybe we should take a little break  good idea i need my wrist brace  all this buttonpushing is aggravating my old nintendo injury  i agree  what did he say  he compared sheldon  to a disposable feminine cleansing product  one might use on a summers eve  yeah and the bag it came in  leonard excellent i want to show you something  can it wait i need to talk to you  just look ive designed the perfect uniforms for our team  the colors are based on star trek the original series  the three of you will wear support red and i will wear command gold  why do they say aa  army ants  isnt that confusing aa might mean something else to certain people  why would a physics bowl team be called anodized aluminum  no i meant  never mind  check it out  i got you a batman cookie jar  oh neat whats the occasion  well youre a friend and you like batman  and cookies and youre off the team  what  howard raj and i just had a team meeting   no you didnt  yes we did i just came from there  okay i dont know where you just came from  but it couldnt have been a team meeting because i wasnt there  ergo the team did not meet  okay let me try it this way  i was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends  and one thing led to another and it turns out youre off the team  why  because youre taking all the fun out of it  im sorry is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun  okay let me try it this way  youre annoying and no one wants to play with you anymore  i see  at this point i should inform you  that i intend to form my own team  and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together  and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears  thanks for the headsup  youre welcome   one more thing  yes  its on bitch   so whod he get to be on his team  he wont say  he just smiles and eats macaroons out of his bat jar  hes using psychological warfare  we must reply in kind i say we wait until he looks at us  then laugh like yes you are a smart and strong competitor  but we are also smart and strong  and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you  how exactly would that laugh go  that sounds more like we are a tall thin woman  who wants to make a coat out of your dalmatians  lets remember that sheldon is still our friend and my roommate  so  so nothing lets destroy him  gentlemen  were going to need a strong fourth for our team  you know who is apparently very smart is the girl who played tvs blossom  she got a phd in neuroscience or something  raj were not getting tvs blossom to join our physics bowl team  how about the girl from the wonder years  gentlemen i believe ive found the solution to all our problems  we cant ask leslie winkle  why because you slept together and when she was done with you  she discarded you like last nights chutney  yes  sometimes youve got to take one for the team  sack up dude  fine  here i go taking one for the team  in the sack   hey leslie  hi guys  so leslie i have a question for you  and it might be a little awkward you know given that i  hit that thing  leonard theres no reason to feel uncomfortable  just because weve seen each others faces  and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus  theres not  gee cause it sure sounds like there should be  rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship  regarding your preferences your idiosyncrasies your performance  are still protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom  thats all very comforting but if its okay  id like to get on to my question now  proceed  we are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team  no thanks im really busy with my likesign dilepton supersymmetry search  dilepton shmylepton we need you  sorry  well we tried  well just have to face sheldonmano y mano y mano a mano  wait youre going up against sheldon cooper  that arrogant misogynistic east texas doorknob  that told me i should abandon my work with highenergy particles  for laundry and childbearing  shes in  so how do you feel  nice and loose come to play got your game face on  are you ready  yeah you know you dont have to stay for the whole thing  oh no i want to sounds really interesting  gentlemen  im just gonna sit down  so is that your team  actually i dont need a team  i could easily defeat you singlehandedly  but the rules require four  so may i introduce the thirdfloor janitor  the lady from the lunch room and my spanish is not good  either her son or her butcher  and what about your team  what rat have you recruited to the ss sinking ship  hello sheldon  leslie winkle  yeah leslie winkle the answer to the question  who made sheldon cooper cry like a little girl  well im polymerized tree sap and youre an inorganic adhesive  so whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction  is reflected off of me returns on its original trajectory  and adheres to you  oh ouch  okay if everyone could please take your seats  heres your tshirt  pms  its a couple days early  it stands for perpetual motion squad  of course what was i thinking  good afternoon everyone  and welcome to this years physics bowl  todays preliminary match features two great teams  aa versus  pms  all night long yall  okay well lets jump right in first question for ten points  what is the isospin singlet partner  of the pizero meson  pms   the eta meson  correct   formal protest  on what grounds  the velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt  denied all right for ten points  what is the lightest element on earth  with no stable isotope  aa  and of course the answer is technetium  terrific  next question  what is the force between two uncharged plates  due to quantum vacuum fluctuations  pms  sheldon can suck on the casimir effect  correct  how does a quantum computer factor large numbers  pms   shors algorithm  correct  to the seventh ergs per calorie  prevosts theory of exchanges  lambda equals one over pi r squared n   the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row  mr wolowitz this is your second warning  a sigma particle  yes assuming the hypothetical planet has a mass greater than the earth  correct  ladies and gentlemen i hold in my hand the final question  the score now stands aa 1150  pms 1175  so for 100 points and the match  please turn your attention to the formula on the screens  solve the equation  holy crap  what the hell is that  looks like something they found on the ship at roswell  come on think leslie  its not gonna work if you rush me you have to let me get there  you are never gonna let that go are you  ten seconds  pms  sorry i panicked  then guess  eight  4  im sorry thats incorrect  aa  if you can answer correctly the match is yours  he doesnt have it  hes got squat  aa i need your answer  the answer is minus eight pi alpha  hang on a second thats not our answer   what are you doing  answering question  winning physics bowl  how do you know anything about physics  here i am janitor  in former soviet union i am physicist  leningrad politechnika  go polar bears  thats a delightful little story  but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything   i answer the questions  you didnt answer question  look now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved russia  but on this physics bowl team i rule with an iron fist  aa i need your official answer   its not what he said  then what is it   i want a different question  you cant   formal protest  denied  informal protest  denied   i need your official answer  no i decline to provide one  thats too bad because the answer your teammate gave was correct  thats your opinion   the winner of the match is  hang on  is proving that you are singlehandedly smarter than everyone else so important  that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team  i dont understand the question   go ahead  the winner is pms  sorry somebodys sitting there  who  my physics bowl trophy  that trophy is meaningless i forfeited therefore you did not win   i know someone who would disagree  who  my physics bowl trophy  leonard is so smart   sheldon who  all right that is very immature  youre right im sorry im not   okay new contest  what are you doing  i am settling once and for all  who is the smartest around here okay   ready  absolutely  bring it on  marsha jan and cindy were the three daughters  in what tv family  the brady bunch  sammy hagar replaced david lee roth as the
