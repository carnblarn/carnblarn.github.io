                wo de zing shi sheldon  non cest  wo de ming zi shi sheldon  wo de ming zi shi sheldon  whats this  thats what you did  i assumed as in a number of languages that the gesture was part of the phrase  well its not  how am i supposed to know that as the teacher its your obligation  to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter  you know im really glad you decided to learn mandarin   why  once youre fluent  youll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me  mei du lui zi  you just called leonard a syphilitic donkey  my apologies  im only as good as my teacher  why are you learning chinese  i believe the szechuan palace has been passing off  orange chicken as tangerine chicken and i intend to confront them  if i were you id be more concerned  about what they are passing off as chicken   i need to use your window  sure go ahead  hey jerk face you forgot your ipod   whats going on  ill tell you whats going on  that stupid selfcentered bastar wrote about our sex life in his blog  drop dead you stupid selfcentered bastard  thank you  okay where were we  not now i have a blog to find  episode 117 the tangerine factor   penny are you okay  im fine leonard just go away  i understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful   go away  okay feel better bye  she doesnt want to talk  not surprising pennys emotional response is originated  in the primitive portion of the brain known as the amygdala  while speech is centered in the much more recently developed neocortex  the former can easily overpower the latter  giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless  or maybe she just doesnt want to talk  look i found an ipod  its smashed beyond repair what are you gonna do with it  what else sell it on ebay as slightly used  it was pennys boyfriends they broke up  apparently he posted intimate details of their physical relationship  on his blog which i cannot find anywhere  im gonna go back and try talking to her again  good idea sit with her  hold her comfort her  and if the moment feels right  see if you can cop a feel  im not going to do that howard  im not aware of a new social convention that requires you to intervene at all  what about damsel in distress  twelfth century code of chivalry not exactly current  youd also have to be knighted for that to apply  i dont care shes upset im going over there  remember to sit on your hands a bit so theyre warm  im her friend im not going to take advantage of her vulnerability  so youre saying if in the depths of despair  she throws herself at you and demands you take her  right there right now youll just walk away  i said im her friend not her gay friend  listen i know you said you didnt want to talk   i dont  sorry   wait  wait did you say wait  tell me the truth  am i just an idiot who picks giant losers  so i pick good guys but turn them into losers   of course not  well  its gotta be one or the other which is it  im sorry what were the choices again  i really thought mike was different  i thought he was  sensitive and smart  i mean not you smart normal nonfreaky smart  yeah no sure  and then he just goes and has to humiliate me  by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it  i tell you its not all that easy to find  really my friends at work found it my sister found it  judging by my email a number of prisoners  at the michigan state penitentiary found it  what exactly did this guy write  not that i need to know the details of your sex life i just thought  never mind  no you know what  you might as well read it everybody else has go ahead  oh god i just feel so betrayed and embarrassed  i just want to crawl into a hole and die  okay well you know this isnt that bad  it just paints the picture  of a very affectionate woman  whos open to expressing her affection  in nontraditional locales  oh god  elevators parks  movie theaters  out of curiosity  is this subway the transportation system  or subway the sandwich shop  sandwich shop  doesnt that violate the health code  no at the sub shop we were only making out  but my point is that  you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed  really do you think i overreacted   maybe a little  because i do that i do overreact  maybe i should call mike and apologize  that would be underreacting  he did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom  and in your case the elevator parks and fast food franchise  youre right i should just say i am done with him  yes you should go ahead say it  but i never gave the man a chance to explain  what is there to explain its all right here  the betrayal  no you were right the first time  this is a man who loves me but in his own stupid way  which is trying to show people how he feels  im pretty sure i never said that  you did better than that you helped me see it on my own  oh good for me  where are you going  im going over to mikes leonard thank you so much  oh sure  maybe i am her gay friend  im going to need another mandarin lesson  i obviously didnt make my point with those people  for gods sake  if you dont like the tangerine chicken dont order the tangerine chicken  i like tangerine chicken im just not getting tangerine chicken   can we please change the subject  sure  tell us again how you screwed up and got penny back together with her boyfriend  just roll the dice  enslaved by warlocks stay here until you roll two four or six  she was mad at him  she was done with him the relationship was broken beyond repair  and i walked over there and i fixed it  boy that story gets better every time you hear it  actually i thought the first two renditions were far more compelling  previously i felt sympathy for the leonard character  now i just find him to be whiny and annoying  eat your tangerine chicken  id love to but i dont have tangerine chicken  thank you so much for your stupid advice  incredible  you managed to screw up the screwup  im back  im sorry i yelled at you  its not your fault  what happened  i went over to mikes to make up with him  yeah no i know that part  but he had already moved on  already that was quick  thats what i said to the woman who had her legs around his neck   penny i am so sorry  how could he do that  you know you did throw an 80gig ipod  yeah no how could he do that  i swear to god i am done with guys like that  you know macho with the perfect body and the hair and the money  yeah that must get old quick  you know just once  i would like to go out with someone  who is nice and honest  and who actually cares about me  what about me  what about you what  what about if you went out with me  are you asking me out  yes i am  asking you out  i was just going off your comment about the nice guy   no i got that  and honest   totally  its not a big deal  yes what  yes i will go out with you  really  why not i mean what do i have to lose  thats the spirit  show me your citrus peels  gay wo kan ni de jud zi pee  show me your citrus peels  gay wo kan ni de jud zi pee  sheldon  im sorry  look do you have a second  a second what pair of underwear  i was just wondering if i could talk to you its about leonard  why me  why not koothrappali or wolowitz  well raj cant talk to me unless hes drunk  and wolowitz is you know disgusting  yes i suppose he is  all im saying is you know leonard the best  not necessarily  im often surprised by my lack of familiarity with leonard  just the other day i discovered he not only has a loofah  he hides it  why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah  i myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally  but i dont condemn those who seek to accelerate the process  and until recently  i had no idea that despite his lactose intolerance  he can tolerate small amounts of nonfat ice cream  without producing a noxious gas that i maintain  in the right concentration could be weaponized  leonard might come home can we talk in my apartment  were not done  no  why not were already through the looking glass anyway  okay so heres the thing  i guess youre aware that leonard asked me out  he didnt actually say anything but when he came back to the apartment  he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in fantasia  thats nice  anyhow the thing i wanted to talk to you about  is since leonard and i have become friends i was just  wanna sit down  i wish it were that simple  i dont spend much time here and so ive never really chosena place to sit  well choose  there are a number of options and  im really not familiar enough with the cushion densities  air flow patterns and dispersion of unlight  to make an informed choice  why dont you just pick one at random and if you dont like it   you can sit somewhere else next time  no thats crazy  you go ahead and talk while i figure it out  heres the thing  so ive known for a while now that leonard has had   a little crush on me  a little crush  i suppose so in the same way menelaus had a little crush on helen of troy  i dont really know who they are   menelaus was the brother of agamemnon  i dont care  the point is  leonard isnt the kind of guy i usually go out with  leonard isnt the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with  would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise 30 degrees  no what im saying is  leonard might be different in a good way  obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well  your last one worked out well for koothrappali  he got a free ipod  glare  on the other hand if things dont go well with leonard  i risk losing a really good friend  im guessing hes not looking for a fling  hes the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for   like you would say light years  i would not say that  no one would say that a light year is a unit of distance not time  thank you for the clarification  draft  people hear the word year and they think duration  footpound has the same problem thats a unit of work not of weight  right thanks   its a common mistake  not the first one ive made today  i think this will be my seat  do you have anything to say that has anything to do with  what im talking about  well lets see  we might consider schrodingers cat  schrodinger is that the woman in 2a  thats mrs grossinger  she doesnt have a cat she has a mexican hairless   annoying little animal  sheldon  sorry you diverted me  anyway in 1935 erwin schrodinger  in an attempt to explain the copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics  he proposed an experiment  where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison  that will break open at a random time  now since no one knows  when or if the poison has been released until the box is opened  the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead  sorry i dont get the point  of course you dont get it i havent made it yet  youd have to be psychic to get it and theres no such thing as psychic  sheldon whats the point  just like schrodingers cat  your potential relationship with leonard right now  can be thought of as both good and bad  it is only by opening the box that youll find out which it is  okay so youre saying i should go out with leonard  let me start again in 1935 erwin schrodinger  two seats right there   sheldon i think ive made a mistake  i can see that  unless youre planning on running a marathon choosing both stuffing  and mashed potatoes is a starchfilled redundancy  no its about penny  a mistake involving penny  youll have to narrow it down  i dont think i can go out with her tonight  then dont  other people would say why not  other people might be interested   im going to talk anyway  i assumed you would  now that im actually about to go out with penny  im not excited im nauseous  then your meal choice is appropriate  starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit  available for violent expulsion  right  you also made a common grammatical mistake  you said nauseous when you meant nauseated  but go on  sheldon this date is probably my one chance with penny  what happens if i blow it  well if we accept your premise  and also accept the highly improbable assumption  that penny is the only woman in the world for you  then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it  would be that you end up a lonely bitter old man with no progeny  the image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers  from scoobydoo cartoons comes to mind  youre not helping  what response on my part  would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion  tell me whether or not to go through with the date  schrodingers cat  thats brilliant  you sound surprised   come on in  thank you  you look very nice  thank you so do you  i made an 800 reservation  okay yeah great listen  maybe we should talk first  but before you say anything have you ever heard of schrodingers cat  actually ive heard far too much about schrodingers cat  good  all right the cats alive lets go to dinner  crazy man call the police
