                so if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it  and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits  if its unobserved it will  however if its observed after its left the plane  but before it hits its target it wont have gone through both slits  agreed whats your point  theres no point i just think its a good idea for a tshirt   excuse me  hang on  one across is aegean  eight down is nabokov   move your finger  phylum which makes 14 across portauprince  see papa docs capitol idea thats portauprince  haiti   can i help you  yes  is this the highiq

leonard i dont think i can do this  what are you kidding youre a semipro  no we are committing genetic fraud  theres no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate highiq offspring  think about that i have a sister with the same basic dna mix  who hostesses at fuddruckers  sheldon this was your idea  a little extra money to get fractional t1 bandwidth in the apartment  i know and i do yearn for faster downloads  but theres some poor woman whos gonna pin her hopes on my sperm  what if she winds up with a toddler who doesnt know if he should use  an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve   im sure shell still love him  i wouldnt  well what do you want to do  i want to leave  whats the protocol for leaving  i dont know ive never reneged on a proffer of sperm before  lets try just walking out   bye  bye nice meeting you  are you still mad about the sperm bank  you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs  not really  if the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimeters   most people will trip  i dont care  two milli that doesnt seem right  no its true i did a series of experiments when i was 12  my father broke his clavicle  is that why they sent you to boarding school  no that was a result of my work with lasers  new neighbor  evidently  significant improvement over the old neighbor  with a skin condition  yes she is   oh hi  hi  we dont mean to interrupt we live across the hall  oh thats nice  we dont live together i mean  we live together  but in separate heterosexual bedrooms  okay well  guess im your new neighbor penny   leonard sheldon  hi  well  welcome to the building  thank you maybe we can have coffee sometime  great   well bye  bye  should we have invited her for lunch  were gonna start season two of battlestar galactica  we already watched the season two dvds  not with commentary  i think we should be good neighbors  and invite her over make her feel welcome  we never invited louieslashlouise over  and that was wrong of us  we need to widen our circle  i have a very wide circle  i have 212 friends on myspace  yes and youve never met one of them  thats the beauty of it  im gonna invite her over  well have a nice meal and chat  chat we dont chat at least not offline  its not difficult  you just listen to what she says  and then you say something appropriate in response  to what end  hi again  hi  anyway  we brought home indian food  and  i know that moving can be stressful  and i find that when im undergoing stress  that good food and company can have a comforting effect  also curry is a natural laxative and i dont have to tell you  that you know a clean colon is just  one less thing to worry about  im no expert but i believe in the context of a luncheon invitation  you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements  youre inviting me over to eat  oh thats so nice id love to  great  so what do you guys do for fun around here  today we tried masturbating for money  season 1 episode 1 pilot  okay make yourself at home  thank you  youre very welcome  this looks like some serious stuff   leonard did you do this  actually thats my work  yeah well its just some quantum mechanics  with a little string theory doodling around the edges  that part there thats just a joke  its a spoof of the bornoppenheimer approximation  so youre like one of those beautiful mind genius guys   this is really impressive  i have a board  if you like boards this is my board  holy smokes  if by holy smokes you mean  a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff  you can find scribbled on the wall of any mens room at mit sure   what  come on  who hasnt seen this differential below here i sit brokenhearted  at least i didnt have to invent 26 dimensions  just to make the math come out  i didnt invent them theyre there   in what universe  in all of them that is the point  do you guys mind if i start  penny  thats where l sit  so sit next to me  no i sit there  whats the difference   whats the difference  here we go  in the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator  to remain warm and yet not so close as to cause perspiration  in the summer its directly in the path of a crossbreeze  created by opening windows there and there  it faces the television at an angle  that is neither direct thus discouraging conversation  nor so far wide as to create a parallax distortion  i could go on but i think ive made my point  do you want me to move   well  just sit somewhere else  fine  sheldon sit  well this is nice  we dont have a lot of company over  thats not true koothrappali and wolowitz come over all the time   i know but  tuesday night  we played klingon boggle till 100 am  yeah i remember   dont say we dont have company  sorry   that has negative social implications  i said im sorry  so  klingon boggle  yeah its like regular boggle but  in klingon  thats probably enough about us so tell us about you  me okay  im a sagittarius  which probably tells you way more than you need to know  yes it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion  that the suns apparent position  relative to arbitrarily defined constellations at the time of your birth  somehow affects your personality  participate in the what  i think what sheldons trying to say  is that sagittarius wouldnt have been our first guess  yeah a lot of people think im a water sign  okay lets see what else  im a vegetarian except for fish  and the occasional steak i love steak  well thats interesting  leonard cant process corn  well do you have some sort of a job  im a waitress at the cheesecake factory  i love cheesecake  youre lactoseintolerant  i dont eat it i just think its a good idea  anyways im also writing a screenplay  its about this sensitive girl who comes to la from lincoln nebraska  to be an actress and winds up a waitress at the cheesecake factory  so its based on your life  no im from omaha  if that was movie i would go see it  i know right  okay lets see what else  guess thats about it  thats the story of penny  it sounds wonderful  it was  until i fell in love with a jerk  whats happening  god you know  as long as high school  it took you 4 years to get through high school  it just i cant believe i trusted him  should i say something i feel like i should say something  you no youll only make it worse  you want to know the most pathetic part  even though i hate his lying cheating guts  i still love him  is that crazy  no its not crazy its a  its a paradox  paradoxes are part of nature think about light  if you look at huygens light is a wave  as confirmed by the doubleslit experiments  but then along comes albert einstein  and discovers that light behaves like particles too  well i didnt make it worse  im so sorry im such a mess  on top of everything else im all gross from moving  and my stupid shower doesnt even work  our shower works  really would it be totally weird if i used it   yes  no  its right down the hall  thanks  you guys are really sweet  well this is an interesting development  how so  it has been some time since weve had a woman  take her clothes off in our apartment  thats not true remember at thanksgiving  my grandmother with alzheimers had that episode  point taken it has been some time  since weve had a woman take her clothes off  after which we didnt want to rip our eyes out  the worst part was watching her carve that turkey  so what exactly are you trying to accomplish here  excuse me  that woman is not going to have sex with you  im not trying to have sex with her  good then you wont be disappointed  what makes you think she wouldnt have sex with me  im a male and shes a female  yes but not of the same species  im not going to engage in hypotheticals here  im just trying to be a good neighbor  of course  thats not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop  that i wouldnt participate  however briefly  do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered  when she discovers your luke skywalker nomoretears shampoo  its darth vader shampoo  luke skywalkers the conditioner   wait till you see this  its fantastic unbelievable  see what  its a stephen hawking lecture from mit in 1974  this isnt a good time  its before he became a creepy computer voice   thats great you guys have to go  why  its just not a good time  leonard has a lady over  yeah right your grandmother back in town  and shes not a lady shes just a new neighbor  hang on there really is a lady here  and you want us out because youre anticipating coitus  im not anticipating coitus  so shes available for coitus  can we please just stop saying coitus  technically that would becoitus interruptus   hey is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower  hi sorry hello  enchant mademoiselle  howard wolowitz caltech department of applied physics  you may be familiar with some of my work  its currently orbiting jupiters largest moon  taking highresolution digital photographs  penny i work at the cheesecake factory  ill show you the trick with the shower  bonne douche  im sorry  its french for good shower   its a sentiment i can express in six languages  save it for your blog howard  all right there it goes it sticks im sorry   okay thanks  youre welcome  youre just gonna to step right okay ill   hey leonard  the hair products are sheldons  can i ask you a favor  a favor  sure you can ask me a favor i would do you a favor for you  its okay if you say no  ill probably say yes  its just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you just met  i really think we should examine the chain of causality here   must we  event a  a beautiful woman stands naked in our shower  event b we drive halfway across town to retrieve a television set  from the aforementioned womans exboyfriend  query on what plane of existence  is there even a semirational link between these events  she asked me to do her a favor sheldon  yes well that may be the proximal cause of our journey  but we both know it only exists in contradistinction  to the higher level distal cause   which is  you think with your penis  thats a biological impossibility and you didnt have to come  right i could have stayed behind and watch wolowitz try to hit on penny  in russian arabic and farsi  why cant she get her own tv  come on you know how it is with breakups  no i dont and neither do you  i broke up with joyce kim  you did not break up with joyce kim she defected to north korea  to mend her broken heart  this situation is much less complicated  theres some kind of dispute between penny and her exboyfriend  as to who gets custody of the tv  she just wanted to avoid having a scene with him   so we get to have a scene with him  no theres not going to be a scene  theres two of us and one of him  leonard the two of us cant even carry a tv  so you guys work with leonard and sheldon at the university  im sorry do you speak english  he speaks english he just cant speak to women  really why  hes kind of a nerd  juice box  ill do the talking   yeah  hi im leonard this is sheldon   hello  what did i just   were here to pick up pennys tv  get lost  okay thanks for you time  were not going to give up just like that  leonard the tvs in the building  weve been denied access to the building ergo we are done  excuse me if i were to give up on the first little hitch  i never would have identified the fingerprints of string theory  in the aftermath of the big bang  my apologies whats your plan  its just a privilege to watch your mind at work  come on we have a combined iq of 360  we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building  what do you think their combined iq is  just grab the door  this is it  ill do the talking  good thinking ill just be the muscle  yeah  im leonard this is sheldon  from the intercom  how the hell did you get in the building  were scientists  tell him about our iq   leonard  what   my mom bought me those pants  im sorry  youre going to have to call her  sheldon i am so sorry i dragged you through this  its okay it wasnt my first pantsing and it wont be my last  and you were right about my motives  i was hoping to establish a relationship with penny  that might have someday led to sex  well you got me out of my pants  anyway ive learned my lesson  shes out of my league im done with her  got my work one day ill win the nobel prize  and then ill die alone  dont think like that youre not going to die alone  thank you sheldon youre a good friend  and youre certainly not going to win a nobel prize  this is one of my favorite places to kick back after a quest  they have a great house ale  cool tiger  yeah ive had him since level ten  his name is buttons  anyway if you had your own game character  we could hang out maybe go on a quest  that sounds interesting  youll think about it  i dont think ill be able to stop thinking about it  smooth  were home  my god what happened  well your exboyfriend sends his regards  and i think the rest is fairly selfexplanatory  im so sorry i really thought if you guys went instead of me  he wouldnt be such an ass  no it was a valid hypothesis  that was a valid what is happening to you  really thank you so much for going and trying youre just  youre so terrific really  why dont you put some clothes on  ill get my purse and dinner is on me okay   really great  thank you  youre not done with her are you  are babies will be smart and beautiful  not to mention imaginary   is thai food okay with you penny  sure  we cant have thai food   we had indian for lunch  so   theyre both currybased cuisines  so  it would be gastronomically redundant  i can see were going to have to spell out everything for this girl  any ideas raj  turn left on lake street and head up to colorado  i know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke  that sounds like fun  i dont know what your odds are in the world as a whole  but as far as the population of this car goes  youre a veritable mack daddy
