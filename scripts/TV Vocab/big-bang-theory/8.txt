                damn you walletnook com  problem  the online description was completely misleading  they said eight slots plus removable id  to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards  but they dont tell you the removable id takes up one slot  its a nightmare  okay now do you really need  the honorary justice league of america membership card  its been in every wallet ive owned since i was 5  why  it says keep this on your person at all times   its right here under batmans signature  and this is leonard and sheldons apartment  guess whose parents just got broadband  leonard

and call me untouchable  yes well now shes a dental student at usc  so we gave her your contact information  why did you do that  youre 26 years old rajesh we want grandchildren   but papa im not

children enter the medical profession  i bet youre right   i bet they love scrubs  whats not to love  excuse me hello  my parents are trying to marry me off to a stranger what am i going to do   i suggest you go through with it  what  romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the 19th century  up until then arranged marriages were the norm and it served society quite well  its the premise of fiddler on the roof  im not a big fan of musicals but i love that show  me too of course it speaks to me culturally  understandable but theres a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity  lets not forget its got some really catchy tunes   oh yeah  absolutely   i know what im gonna do  what  find new friends   so who wants to rent fiddler  no need we have the special edition  well maybe we are like haroon and tanvir  this is dr sheldon cooper  yeah i need to cancel my membership to the planetarium  yeah well im sorry too  but theres just no room for you in

oh yeah i tried to watch that online but they wanted my credit card  its a childrens story  oh no it isnt  when i was a little boy and got sick which was most of the time  my mother would read it  its about an indian princess who befriends a monkey  who was mocked by the other monkeys because he was different  for some reason i related to it quite strongly  i know the reason  we all know the reason  sheldon what are you getting at  that woman looks exactly like the pictures of princess panchali in the book  how often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life  every year at comiccon  every day at disneyland  you can hire snow white to come to your house  of course they prefer it if you have a kid  hey guys this is lalita gupta  lalita this is leonard and sheldon and howard and penny  isnt it great she isnt fat anymore  forgive me your highness  for i am but a monkey and it is in my nature to climb  i did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair  im sorry  you are the living embodiment of the beautiful princess panchali  oh no kidding who is that  a beloved character from an indian folktale  oh  us indian or come to our casino indian   you indian  oh  the resemblance is remarkable  i can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair  well thanks  i imagine you smell very nice too  i shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as i can  really so do i  but youre a dentist hes nuts  dont be insulting rajesh  so sheldon tell me more about this princess you say i look like  it was said that the gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars  and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips  oh my   back off sheldon  what  if you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath  im not hitting on her  and i am not your lady  and you have no wrath  you are my lady our parents said so  we are for all purposes  lets get something straight  the only reason i came tonight was to get my parents off my case  i dont need to be getting this oldworld crap from you  thats the kind of spirit with which princess panchali led the monkeys to freedom   screw panchali  you cant talk to me like that  but youre not princess panchali  luckily for you she could have you beheaded   sheldon are you hungry  i could eat  lets go  what just happened  beats the hell out of me  ill tell you what
