supermans big ice thingy right  you know im in such a good mood  im actually finding your tenuous grasp of the english language  folksy and charming today  what smells so good  that is the intoxicating aroma of kadhai paneer  a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds  not only is it indian cuisine which koothrappali loathes  it contains a generous helping of peanuts  which would reduce wolowitz to a wheezing 97pound blister  and finally its main ingredient is paneer  a farmers cheese  that would cause leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes  yum  well enjoy your big evening  i realize youre also on your own tonight  so if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do  please do not disturb me  have fun sheldon  i shall

latest twitters  im at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss  my life is meaningless my future is without hope  why dont we take him to see the blue man group  you think thatd help  usa today calls them exuberant fun for the whole family  i dont know howard isnt really the family fun kind of guy  its too bad he wasnt here for that hooker  shes exactly his type a hooker  you know i bet if we hired her that would cheer him up  were not gonna get wolowitz a hooker  im so lonely and horny  i may open this 20 jar of peanuts and end it all  i suppose it wouldnt hurt to get an estimate  so how was your day  are you trying to make small talk  sweetie you really dont have to  no its the accepted convention  how was your day  they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant   so my hours are gonna be  im sorry  thats not going to interest me at all just eat  hello again  hi listen  if youre not busy we were thinking maybe you could   we were wondering  if youre really a prostitute   you guys cops  no  im a prostitute  okay great  the thing is weve got this friend and hes kind of down in the dumps  and we thought maybe you could cheer him up  with sex  i think she

is there a way that we can do this  where he doesnt know that youre a you know  prostitute  you want the girlfriend experience  yes yeah exactly the girlfriend experience  actually if its not too much to ask  could we have the jewish girlfriend experience  okay thats question 20 you have to guess  i dont know sheldon  are you star wars  how can one person be a whole movie  i give up can we just do something else  fine  i was spock  are you and leonard friends with benefits  what  are you and leonard friends with benefits  where did that even come from did he say we were  no leonard said nothing but who knows what goes on over here  when he pretends your mail was misdelivered  just mail no benefits  i see  why are you asking  im curious about the whole social construct  on its face the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite  assuming one is afflicted with such  without emotional entanglement  that seems eminently practical  what ive observed however  is howard wolowitz crying like a little girl  some people just cant handle that kind of relationship  can you  excuse me  are you able to have sex with men  without developing an emotional attachment  i really dont want to talk about this with you  is this conversation making you uncomfortable  of course its making me uncomfortable cant you tell  i really have no idea  i dont particularly excel at reading facial expressions  im uncomfortable sheldon  thank you thats very helpful  all right where are these amazing shrimp  behold  seriously you think this is the size of a babys arm  a little baby  im going back to the room  boy would it maybe kill them to put out a nice brisket  hi there howard wolowitz  esther rosenblatt  i dont think the managers coming tonight so here  are you suggesting i sleep on the couch  it wasnt the first suggestion that came to mind  but its the one im going with  i cant sleep on your couch i sleep in a bed  and given its dimensions i have no intention of living out snickerings  beloved childrens book the tall man from cornwall  what  there was a tall man from cornwall  whose length exceed his bed  my body fits on it but barely upon it  theres no room for my big cornish head  all right i will give you my bed on one condition  that you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours  may i say one last thing  only if it doesnt rhyme  all right  good night  turnons let me see  reading a good book in front of the fire  long walks on the beach  and getting freaky on the sabbath with a bacon cheeseburger  really me too  oy gevalt youre hot  excuse me for a moment  hows it going  cut the crap you set this up didnt you  shes a hooker isnt she  a prostitute yes  you already gave her the money  thank you  what  i cant sleep  maybe thats because your hole is still open  im homesick  your home is 20 feet from here  it doesnt matter  its in a galaxy far far away  damn it  what do you want me to do  sing soft kitty  thats only for when youre sick  homesick is a type of being sick  come on do i really have to  i suppose we can stay up and talk  soft kitty  warm kitty  little ball of fur  happy kitty   sleepy kitty  sleepy kit  start over  soft kitty  warm kitty
