                so you see what youre eating is not technically yogurt  because it doesnt have enough live acidophilus cultures  its really just ice milk with carrageenan added for thickness  thats very interesting  its also not pink and has no berries  yeah but it doesnt really answer my question   what was your question again  do you want some   right no im lactose intolerant  right   so gas  yeah got it  well good night  what are you doing  theres a draft  i didnt feel a draft  why dont we just go into your  yeah you know what maybe we should slow things down a little  i didnt mean to go into your apartment to   go fast  no i know  i know what you meant its just this is only our first date  okay sure no problem  why dont we just figure out where were going  and when we want to get there  and then rate of speed equals distance over time  solve for r  or we could just wing it  that might work too   good night leonard  good night  hes coming screensaver  hey leonard how was your date  bite me  sheldon how could you just sit there and let them spy on me  they were clever  they exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing  you should thank us when future generations try to determine  why your relationship with penny crashed and burned  this right here is the black box  what are you talking about the date went fine  she said she wants to slow things down  okay so she said she wants to slow things down  its like saying im really enjoying this meal  im going to slow down and savor it  no its like this fish tastes bad  so im gonna slow down and spit it out   you being the fish  im not the fish  really did you make a second date  no we sort of decided to wing it  even i know thats lame  okay all right lets assume your hypothesis  we went to dinner we talked we laughed we kissed  where could i have possibly gone wrong  think back leonard the littlest things can set women off  like hey the waitress is hot  i bet we could get her to come home with us  or how much does your mom weigh  i want to know what im getting into   i didnt say anything like that  good cause they dont work  they also dont care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate  sadly thats my home run swing  look everything went fine  i didnt even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters  that woman across the hall is into me  lets go to the tape  look at her reaction to the good night kiss  no change in respiration pupils undilated   no flushing of the chest  nice closeup by the way  interesting her jaws are clenched no tongue access  clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans  thats not a bad sign  please you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement  and the worst sign of all is youre here and not there  im not there because im taking things slow  which by the way compared to you guys approaches warp speed  and take down that camera  he was a lot more fun when he had no hope  give him time  episode 201 the bad fish paradigm   seriessubcom  subwayfr  foromcom  hi  oh hi penny  fyi the hot water is inadequate on machine two so colors only  and four is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle   so avoid using it for your delicates  thanks  good lord why dont you just take your clothes  down to the river and beat them with a rock  can i ask you a question  i would prefer that you not but i wont go so far as to forbid it  all right i heard yes so  heres my question  has leonard ever dated  you know a regular girl  i assume youre not referring to digestive regularity  because ive come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate  no i meant has he ever been involved with someone  who wasnt a brainiac  a few years ago he did go out with a woman  who had a phd in french literature  how is that not a brainiac  well for one thing she was french  for another it was literature  so  do you think that if leonard and i keep dating  hell eventually get bored with me   that depends  on what  do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics  do you speak klingon   you know any card tricks  okay you know what  i get it leonard has no business being involved  with a waitressslashactress who felt so insecure  that she lied to him about finishing community college  why would you lie about that  he was going on and on about this college and that grad school  i didnt want him to think i was some kind of stupid loser  you thought the opposite of stupid loser  was community college graduate  you know there are a lot of successful people in this country  who are community college graduates  yeah but you are neither  right  okay this is between you and me you cannot tell leonard any of this  youre asking me to keep a secret  well im sorry  but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret  so i couldve chosen if i wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping  you cant impose a secret on an ex post facto basis  what  secret keeping is a complicated endeavor  one has to be concerned not only about what one says  but about facial expressions autonomic reflexes  when i try to deceive i myself have more nervous tics  than a lyme disease research facility  its a joke  it relies on the homonymic relationship  between tick the bloodsucking arachnid  and tic the involuntary muscular contraction  i made it up myself  okay look if leonard finds out that i lied  i will absolutely die of embarrassment   physiologically impossible  sheldon please  look i am asking you as a friend  so youre saying that friendship contains within it  an inherent obligation to maintain confidences  yeah  interesting  one more question and perhaps i should have led with this  when did we become friends   ie i couldnt become green lantern  unless i was chosen by the guardians of oa  but given enough startup capital and an adequate research facility  i could be batman  you could be batman  sure im batman see   hi guys  hi penny  if youre free friday night i thought maybe we could go see a movie  oh you know i think i have the dinner shift on friday  what about saturday  im not sure the manager hasnt posted the schedule yet   how about i let you know  great  so you just let me know when you know  okay so oh god i am the bad fish  what did i do wrong  why are you asking me  i have no information about your interactions with penny  other than what you have provided me  nor do i have any method of learning such things   what does that mean  nothing  you seem to be implying an informational backchannel  between me and penny where obviously none exists  no i didnt  i just think you need to be careful how you phrase things sir   whats going on with you  i might ask you the same question  why are you attempting to drag me  into matters which have nothing to do with me  but exist between you and penny a person to whom i barely speak  whats wrong with your face  theres no reason to bring my looks into this  good day leonard   what  i said good day  good day  also today we have a freshcaught alaska salmon  and thats served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice   our soup of the day is  you must release me from my oath  sheldon im working   why dont you take a minute to decide  oh my  i cant keep your secret  im going to fold like an energybased de novo protein  in conformational space  like a renaissance tryptich  like a cheap suit  look why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret  im constitutionally incapable thats why i was refused clearance  for a prestigious government research fellowship  at a secret military supercollider  located beneath a fake agricultural station  of traverse city michigan  which you did not hear about from me  just forget i told you about me   not graduating from community college  forget  you want me to forget this mind does not forget  i havent forgotten a single thing  since my mother stopped breastfeeding me   it was a drizzly tuesday  okay  you promised me you would keep my secret  so just figure out a way to do it  leonard im moving out  what do you mean youre moving out why  there doesnt have to be a reason  yeah there kinda does  not necessarily  this is a classic example of munchausens trilemma  either the reason is predicated on a series of subreasons  leading to an infinite regression  or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements  or its ultimately circular  ie im moving out because im moving out  im still confused  leonard i dont see how i could have made it any simpler  hey questce que sup  we just got back from that exhibit of those plasticized human cadavers  and some of those skinless chicks were hot  if youll excuse me im going to pack  thats kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia  its not you howard he says hes moving out  what did you do  did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the tv  did you take a bandaid off in front of him  did you buy generic ketchup forget to rinse the sink  talk to him through the bathroom door  adjust the thermostat cook with cilantro  pronounce the t in often  did you make fun of trains  no i didnt do anything hes just gone insane  we all knew this day was coming  that was fast  its my prepacked disaster evacuation bag  its recommended by the department of homeland security  and sarah connor  where are you going to live  until i find a permanent place i will stay with friends  bye  you cant stay with me i have a teenytiny apartment  excuse me but isnt hosting guests an aspect of manushya yajna  one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the hindu householder  i hate trains  dont be ridiculous you love trains  yes i do come on  see you later leonard  this could work  this is a very old building  it used to be a watch factory  what  dont you worry about the residual radium  from the luminous dials  not until now  i cant believe i didnt bring my geiger counter  i had it on my bed and i didnt pack it   if youre not comfortable staying  im kidding i packed it  it was a joke  i was subverting the conversational expectations  i believe they call that the ol switcheroo  terrific  is that woman aishwarya rai  yes isnt she an amazing actress  actually id say shes a poor mans madhuri dixit  how dare you  aishwarya rai is a goddess  by comparison madhuri dixit is a leprous prostitute  sorry i didnt mean to offend you  obviously youre not that familiar with indian cinema  who is it  stripogram  tag youre it  shouldnt you put him in a brown paper bag  and set him on fire  ive never slept on an air mattress before  no lumbar support whatsoever  maybe youd be happier on a park bench  i dont see any way to get a park bench in here   do you want to switch  no thats fine  im perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle   get out of bed were switching  only if you want to  just get in the bed  whats going on  are you boys roughhousing  were just talking ma  if you dont settle down right now  im not going to let you have any more sleepovers  for gods sake ma im 27 years old  and its not even a school night  comfy now  that poster of halle berry is a little unnerving  so dont look at it  shes like my fourth favorite catwoman  no kidding  yeah julie newmar michelle pfieffer eartha kitt and then her  what about lee merriweather  i forgot about lee merriweather  im glad thats settled  that makes halle berry my fifth favorite catwoman  its julie newmar michelle pfieffer   eartha kitt lee merriweather  please im begging you go to sleep  im trying im counting catwomen  she did make a fine mutant in the xmen movies though   for gods sake  shes not my favorite of the xmen  in order that would be wolverine cyclops  i forgot professor x  professor x wolverine cyclops  iceman then storm angel the beast  no wait nightcrawler  professor x nightcrawler wolverine cyclops iceman storm  angel  im coming  there he is  there my old buddy bud bud  whats with him  koothrappali dumped him on me and he couldnt get to sleep  so i gave him a glass of warm milk  with a handful of my moms valium in it  but he still wouldnt shut up so tag youre it  im baack   i still dont know why you left  i cant tell you  why not  i promised penny  you promised penny what  i wouldnt tell you the secret  what secret tell me the secret  mom smokes in the car  jesus is okay with it but we cant tell dad  not that secret the other secret   im batman  damn it sheldon  you said penny told you a secret whats the secret  okay ill tell you  but you cant tell leonard  i promise  penny lied about graduating from community college  cause shes afraid shes not smart enough for leonard  so its nothing i did its her problem  i drank milk that tasted funny  penny thinks im too smart for her thats ridiculous  i know  most of your work is extremely derivative  and dont worry thats not a secret  everybody knows  hi yeah hi  i know whats been bothering you about us and i have the answer  what are you talking about  first i wanna say that its not sheldons fault  he tried very hard to keep your secret  if howard hadnt drugged him he wouldve taken it to his grave   he told you  yes but its okay  now that we know what the problem is theres a simple solution  pasadena city college  a place for fun a place for knowledge  this man here is playing hackeysack and this girls gonna be a paralegal  oh i get it  because dr leonard hofstadter  cant date a girl without a fancy college degree  its really not that fancy its just a city college  right but i have to have some sort of degree to date you  that doesnt matter to me at all  so its fine with you if im not smart  absolutely  okay this time i know where i went wrong  bite me
