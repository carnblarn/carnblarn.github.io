telling me its the eight of diamonds  thats amazingly close  gee i got it wrong well  i guess you won the shirt off my back   okay thats amazing   its the queen of diamonds  no no no i had but if

that you might  wanna button that shirt up  no im good anyway listen michael  i need the yacht  i kind of made a commitment   one year earlier gob had appeared  on a  youthoriented music network  when they did a segment on  spring break newport beach  now that ive gotten your attention  id like to announce that one year from today  i shall make that beautiful yacht disappear     wow hes amazing  he hasnt done it and youre  holding a four of spades in your hand  i dont care im loving the ride you know   how are you gonna do it   well youve got two weeks off   youre about to find out    maybe well meet a couple  young coeds along the way   how young is too young for you   thats not gonna happen okay  theres not gonna be any coeds  there certainly isnt gonna be any magic  it is a path to a lonely  life where people mock you   and you dont even realize  it  michael im a magi  i see what you did  youre not dressed yet i thought you  were working for me today at the office  you guys stay open during spring break  were not orthodox but dont worry about it  kittys coming back and its just in time  although shes caused nothing but  problems since shes worked for me      kitty isnt that

with a  prisoner named white power bill  a conflict tobias  inadvertently helped him solve  i sold you for a pack of cigarettes  but didnt you come here to  research the nature of fear  i cant think of a better  teacher than white power bill  hes like a masters course unto himself  so you think im a coward  theres only one man ive ever called coward  thats brian doylemurray  no  what im calling you  is a television actor  ouch   and so tobias remained in prison   as lindsay and maeby  arrived at  nanas   knocking  remember shes a very old woman  were going to get in get the cash and get out  is this who i think it is   together nana   unfortunately the woman  who now lived there was not their nana  a fact that took lindsay and  maeby an hour and a half to ascertain  go go its not her drop the photo album  were not in the  photo album   drop the pie   panting   and michael  arrived at work to find kitty  hey kitty how are you feeling  much better man i was really stuffed up there  up here michael up here  whyd you have to get  sick now what was the rush   in fact it was the  previous years spring break  that was responsible  for kittys rush  when the makers of the popular video

 when he was begging me not to  well hes my twin brother i can show you   crying mumbling   laughing  it was funny but you know  kitty had access to all kinds of information  god knows what she poked her nose into  theres enough evidence on  this boat to put me away  the only real thing i have  oh god theres nothing to hold on to down there   youre like a boy  whats wrong with you  all these books are cooked   sobbing   im sorry i gotta do my job   and i gotta get out of prison  next time someone threatens me i  may not have a soninlaw to offer  i cant come in here all the toffer  i may not have a  soninlaw to offer me counseling  you know he should have stayed a  shrink hes very gifted you know   in fact tobias  had even produced a videotape  but its brief success was  due to its misleading name  once this was discovered all  but 10 of the videos were returned  hire kitty back okay for the company no no  for me michael  crying   it is kind of a funny face  oh come on now  theres just absolutely no  purse that will go with this outfit  youve got a little pocket there annyong  annyong   thats not getting old     wheres nana  i sent  her on a wonderful cruise  you just missed a wonderful call from her  she just came back from a wonderful  costume party that the captain threw  she gained 10 pounds  theres so much food on that boat  shes up to 74  its wonderful just wonderful   in fact lucilles  mother had been dead for six months  she tried pesto for the first time  can you believe that  ninetytwo years old and she never tried pesto   lucille feared that the family  would come after the  inheritance if they found out  was she on the phone annyong  annyong   sighs emery board  isnt he great and he goes with everything   meanwhile gob was  adjusting to a new companion ofhis own  thats not the end of the  trick theres a big surprise coming  take your tshirt off please  what oh you changed the  trick its a different trick  if i roll up this tshirt put it in this hat  gob hey george michael  hang on were in the middle of something  if youll be so kind as to  expose your breast please   no no no no no no hey what the  hell are you doing   people shouting  dad its misdirection youre supposed  to keep your eye on the shirt in the hat  get downstairs right now come on  buddy what are you doing here   i  dying to see how he makes this yacht disappear  hes not going to make the  yacht disappear i told him that  its driving me crazy its like a  mind puzzle an awesome mind puzzle   michael looked at his son and saw  that he truly was inspired by his uncle  that perhaps the boy actually admired him  i gotta get you out of here youre  gonna come work with me at the office  go wait in the stair car  hey i want you to explain something  to me im out looking for kitty  and i find my son in the middle of  a girls with low selfesteem video  dont worry hes gonna be covered  with a blue dot he approached me  and as for kitty i

on that right now  i stay away from your son   you let me use the yacht  the holidays really brings out the best in you  well   meanwhile tobias  found his experience as a therapist  was helping him deal with his new cell mate  yes but where does the hate come from bill   what causes it  thejews i guess  sure but i think you need to look deeper  i think these are issues of selfesteem  i know what its like i know how it feels  to have a father or in  my case a fatherinlaw  who doesnt respect you  anyhoo we have very little time  before this uh 400 pounding you promised me  im gonna take a shot at something and say  that i think you hate white power bill   i hate you  you hate white power bill   i hate the government   you hate white power bill   i hate my  father    recreation all prisoners one hour   go get em    i hate white power bill      i got a  prisoner down prisoner down   you killed him  well l  like dorothy the wicked witch is dead   all hail dorothy     and at an elegant  restaurant michael asked kitty to come back  who are you asking back michael me or these  i want you all back i want the  whole gang okay please kitty  im trying real hard here you know  can we just make believe that none of  this ever happened and just start fresh  michael of course ill come back  cause i never really left  because we both know that you cant fire people  no i did fire you and now im hiring you back  you dont have authority over me  they dont  have nachos here  you know what why dont we forget it  because ive been trying to be  very very generous to you  and you dont respect me so im firing you okay   you are fired  all right michael  but i know where things are and you dont  and you are asking for a whole world of trouble  if youre threatening me  youre gonna be very sorry   are you  threatening me  yeah  thats a threat im threatening you  did you hear that everyone  michael bluth is threatening me  ive gotta get out of  here im a part of the story  i cant be a part of the story  i cant be a part of the story  say goodbye to your company michael   and say goodbye to  these  no  no no no no no  cause its the last time  a woman shows all during a fracas  at a local restaurant sources say   george michael was working  harder than ever over his spring break  filling in for the now twicefired kitty  look at us working together  you get the hang of this  and this could be your summer  i dont know dad i really  wanted to see gobs magic show and  no you dont isnt this much  more fun working with your dad   its just there was some  other  you gonna get that    thanks laura   good afternoon bluth company  talk you off talk you off what poppop  george michael i thought you were um  whens that voice gonna drop wheres kitty  i think dad fired her  again he wants to talk to you  i dont wanna talk to him i  made my decision and thats that  oh you heard yeah all right   what did he  say  if i clean  it up its not really a sentence   and so george sr made another call  kittys on the loose i need you  to make something disappear for me  just some books in that cooler marked maddas   great    george sr hung up  confident that his problems  would finally be taken care of  hey littlejustice  you uh painted your shoes red  call me the tin man im  a friend of dorothys now   and she wants to see you    and back at the office  lindsay arrived with her  daughter and her mounting suspicions  mom says she sent nana on a cruise  youre still on this how  much was in those birthday cards  its not about the money  michael its about nana  i think mom sent her to a nursing home  some gray windowless room against her will   so what was it like out  there today  nice sunny  wow  so how do you think gobs  gonna make this yacht disappear  well ill be working here  so i guess ill never know  the only real way to find out how its done  is to sneak on the boat while he does it  but if he makes it disappear  wont everyone see me standing there  lets just sit quietly and consider  how ridiculous that statement was  anyways if it was me thats what i would do  i wanna check out moms financial activity  call her banks maybe run a hospital search   its gonna mean a lot of  hard work but ill put somebody on it  george michael  where is george michael   in fact at maebys suggestion  george michael was off to visit his uncle gob  hi uncle gob i came by to see  if you need any help with your magic show   great  i think its so  great that youre doing this   im prepping right now   howd you get my dads permission   suddenly gob  remembered the promise he had made  to stay away from michaels son  none of your damn  business get the hell out of here  what   you dont have the magic in you  you never did you dont have it here  so take a look its the last  time youre gonna see these    quietly sorry kid  more than  youll ever  what   beat it    as gob was  forced to send away someone he loved   quietly  youll be missed  george sr was forced to visit  someone he had once tried  to shove out of a moving car   welcome  youre dorothy  i thought the two of us could talk manonman  im afraid im serious  i bought you   remember to let it steep for  five minutes  oh dear god  ive been in this family for 16 years  and i dont think weve ever had a conversation   im not gonna discuss this  you hate me  yeah i do hate you you took my daughter  my precious little girl and moved her away  and now im here and i am  afraid i will never get her back  afraid youre afraid  fear has turned into hate  so frightened inmate 2 isnt frightened at all  hes angry hes a crabby old coot  and he needs love   just like everyone    get your  beeps hands off of me  shh dont be scared    singing    continues   and on the  beach the show was beginning    crowd cheering     any magician can make the  queen of diamonds disappear  but what about a whole boat              mom have you seen george michael  we just got here i couldnt find my keys   i can never find  anything in  here  we love you  where once there was a yacht now there is naught   cheering continues  all right so howd you do it  michael a magician never reveals his  i sunk it i sunk the yacht  at least i think i sunk it i mean i  blew it up and i dont see it anywhere  my heart was in my throat when that  curtain came down and  laughing   you sank the yacht  shh   you sank the yacht  shh   you sunk a  700000 yacht   900000 worth of insurance on it  and got rid of the  evidence how about a good job   seeing a window of  opportunity lucille made  a startling announcement   nana was on that yacht  what   you killed nana   shes lying  nana wasnt on that yacht shes fine  shes been dead for six months   lindsay had  learned this information   for about six  months  when she  spoke to the familys personal banker  later fearing that lindsay was onto her  lucille went to the bank herself  there must be somewhere i can put  this money where it cant be touched  i suppose you could keep it in your purse  very funny but im not carrying a purse  wheres the money mom i want the money  you cant have it its in  a trust fund for annyong    annyong  no  one can touch it but me  and i retain control of it until hes 18  i dont know whats more  offensive the fact you didnt tell us  about our grandmothers death or  that you sunk a  700000 yacht  stop lecturing me i just lost my mother  im so glad george michael  wasnt here to see any of this  maeby where is george michael  um well if hes not here id just  have to say hes probably on the yacht  on the yacht   in fact george  michael had boarded the yacht  but when he saw the evidence of gobs lifestyle  he realized that this  perhaps was not the life he wanted  while kitty went in search of retribution  in the form of the files in the cooler  george michaels a good kid  im sure hes at the office  right i told him to stay away from you   i told you to stay away from  him   i tried i told him to get out  bluth company george  michael speaking not kitty   thank god youre there  i  dont need a real spring break  i really think i am much better  off here alone in this office   michael realized  what he had done to his son  so he came up with a solution   youre fired  really  can you fire people  yeah go have a spring break  thanks dad  are you sure youre gonna be okay without kitty  dont you worry shell turn up  on the next arrested development  lupe makes a startling discovery  oh so that makes annyong 18  and michael finds himself in  the middle of the search  for a missing kitty  well we have a  restaurant full of people saying  that you threatened kitty  the last time she was seen  how does anybody even remember this   she showed her knobs in  the steakhouse sir  she
