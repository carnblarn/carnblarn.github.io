when you were getting along so well  theyve got to be kidding me   michaels brother gob meanwhile  had missed the meeting that morning  after being delayed by his girlfriend marta    te quiero   english please  i love you  great now im late   and while gob took  his girlfriend for granted  michael was learning spanish to get closer to her   that is not  something i can bring to my boss   unfortunately the one tape  he could find was oflittle use to him   are you going to  the complimentary breakfast     thatll get her hot  well if it isnt the boy  who lives under the stairs   hey gob

take his place as adam  i dont know uncle buster   well you dont have the  frontspiece  yet  frontspiece  look i dont want to go through a whole song  and dance with you youre going to love it  you just cant do anything that violates the  original painting like giggling or itching  they do allow some nervous crying  but you can tell they dont like it   and maeby was teaching her  parents a lesson for forgetting her  who knows how long ill be gone  when she spotted george michael  nice pecs got a kickin bod  thus george michael found a  compelling reason to keep the muscle suit on   ringing  law offices of barry zuckerkorn  its michael bluth for barry    whispers im not here   barrys not here can i give her a message  tell her she needs to whisper  a little softer next time  and im not paying for this phone call  i am not a girl you bowtied  go on call me  something im redoing my kitchen  thats it ive had it with this jerk barry  im going to make mom sit down with  wayne whether she likes it or not   youre the  jerk  did i just wake  you up i didnt know you were home  no michael i dont just sleep all day   actually  lindsay was so upset at michael  that she tried meditating to calm herself  but ended up taking a twohour angry nap  yeah this suitcase should be big enough  where is all this coming from  i thought we were getting along  yeah so did i and now i  hear youre telling our mother  that im completely  irresponsible and a stayinbed mom  that doesnt even sound like me  that sounds like mom or bruce vilanch   could be bruce vilanch   then why would she say it   because were getting along   because were friends again  you gotta remember mom  typically has nothing in her system  except a bottle of vodka and an estrogen pill  speaking of which   michael and  lindsay proceeded to drink  and air their grievances about their mother  shes always trying to get me to  admit that my marriage isnt working   and hows it going with you  and tobias   its not working  and thats why i wanted her  help with my credit card debt  im trying to take at least some  of the pressure off this marriage  and if anything its worse  now that were sharing a bedroom  you guys were not sharing a bedroom before  well the cutoffs arent exactly a turnon  whats the deal with the cutoffs  youve got to promise not to tell anyone this   okay  hes a nevernude  is that exactly what it sounds like   tobias suffered a  rare psychological affliction  of never being able to be completely naked  excuse me do these effectively hide my thunder  oh im sorry no i need  you to be completely undressed  i am completely undressed  i thought he just  liked cutoffs   me too  what about you whats  going on with your love life  have you even met anyone since your wife  that is the one subject i am  not eager to talk about lindsay  i love marta   moms housekeeper  gobs girlfriend   oh my god  yeah  listen youre a great guy  and if she doesnt see that   then someone  else will  you  know what else lindsay youre great  and im gonna move some money around  if its gonna help you get out of debt   no michael  yeah  the hell with mom and here moms  never gonna get between us again   the next day buster  having pawned off playing adam  went to lucille 2 to ask  her out for christmas eve  that is terrific cause i  got two tickets to the pageant   clears throat my my  mothers going to be there   and george  michael was trying to pass   as a more muscular boy than  he actually  was  one hundred  one hundred i had you at 10  i did some earlier in the day its a  running total so whats with the suitcase  its a little test to  get my parents to notice me  you ever get the feeling  like no one even sees you  ive got a really good body so no  hey gang what you doing  just packing up packing it on up   uhhuh  listen can i talk to you alone for a moment  ill leave you two alone here  oh no george michael i meant you  maeby can we have the room  so as you know i was hoping  to play adam in this thing  and i want you to know that i am not threatened  you know id be happy to let you play adam  give me the suit give me the suit  im actually wearing it right  now and i cant tell you why  youre wearing it right now  i have to wear it all the  time youd never understand  oh please ill never under  ill never understand  that you can never be nude  i understand more than youll never know  yikes   michael finally arranged  a meeting with attorney waynejarvis  looking for a more professional  approach to our representation  well im a professional   im serious and im a  professional   thats fantastic   so how long have you been  practicing   i  also dont like small talk  i find that unprofessional why  should i be billing you for small talk  when im enjoying it as much as you are  then this must be a  freebie cause im having a ball   chuckles when youre ready  to get serious give me a call  no no no im sorry im  sorry im serious im ready  good if you retain my services i  will get your father out of jail  and we will be countersuing  before the end of the year  were gonna get this companys  name back to where it started   or hopefully  higher  i didnt  say that dont hold me to that  i wont and i appreciate  that to a wonderful degree  my mother is on her way up here  and shes resistant to the  idea of hiring a new attorney  if she even sees you she  probably wont come in the room  i shall duck behind the couch   what a pro     michael  hi  i need to get the money to get  your father out for the pageant  actually thats not why i called  you here today and im not doing that  i gave that money to lindsay  to pay off her credit card debt   whatd she do get you  drunk  no we  just uh well  we did drink a little bit howd you know that  because thats what she said shed do  i said you wouldnt give her the money  and she said he will if i get him drunk  probably because she  thinks youre a cheap bastard  oh her words  she set me up  all that stuff about her marital  troubles and tobias being a nevernude  a nevernude i thought he just liked cutoffs  how do you treat somebody in  your own family like that  lying and deceiving and saying  anything just to get your own way  so what did you want  to see me about   hmm  oh um theres a big bowl of candy in my office   why dont you go eat it   waynejarvis attorney at law  i have a responsibility to tell you  that there is no candy in this office  lindsay   what are you doing here   i had to get away from marta  if i have to smell another meal of fish  rice and mango im gonna kill somebody   now michaels learning spanish  whats up with  that  oh who knows  he wont get your father  out of jail for a night  hes bringing in a new  attorney   new attorney  and hes learning spanish  hes hiding something  and i intend to find out what it is  do yourself a favor get him drunk   scoffs barry  i see youre getting closer to our attorney  well i just want you to know that i  wont be needing your help after all  my brother michael came through as  he always does and as you never do  whatever it takes to get your  relationship with that nevernude back on track   michael told you that  he couldnt wait to   and later while  michael was meeting with wayne  my thing with tobias was a secret like  you stealing your brothers girlfriend   i open up to you and you  run and tell  mommy  excuse me  outside please thank you pardon us  like it all wasnt just lies to get me to  pay that debt isnt that why you got me drunk   i got you drunk  mom  told me about your little plan   what plan i had a great  time last night  so did i  then why are we yelling at each other   mom   unbelievable  she did it again   all right weve got to  teach her a lesson  hmm  excuse me wayne my sister and i were  outside having a business discussion  and we were wondering if  theres some sort of legal way  that we can humiliate our mother  something shaming something public  ive used one adjective to  describe myself what is it  professional  so how are we going to screw mom  maybe we can get  barry to help   forget it  i think i was right about them all along  you know barrys taking mom to the pageant   on a date  yeah  ugh if dad could see her on a  date with barry hed go crazy  which would allow us to hire wayne  how do you feel about staying  in debt just a little bit longer   so they decided to spend  the money michael had promised lindsay  to get their father out for the  pageant where hed catch his wife with barry  maeby too continued to try  to teach her parents a lesson  okay so i printed the fake  airline ticket from my computer  if my parents miss this i  really might go to south america   that says portugal  thats right   maebys parents  didnt find the ticket but gob did  portugal  which confirmed his suspicions  gonna live it up down old  south america way huh mikey  and buster finally gave in to lucille 2s wishes  you ready to show me off  before god and the whole world  its not my dads reaction im worried about  and george michael finally saw the  painting he was going to be recreating     and then what frontspiecemeant  george sr got his 24 hours of  freedom as the pageant finally began  you know i saw you do this when  i was a kid i was so impressed  you know you were so still and godlike  it was at that moment that  i knew i would be a dancer  glad i could make a difference  michael and lindsay searched the  crowd for their mother and barry  so they could revel in the  public shaming they had engineered  mom what the hell are you doing  but instead they found her with wayne  i dont have to answer that  i dont know which one of  you im more disappointed in  no its wayne wayne   i have needs i am a man  hey watch  whats the difference your  father doesnt care about me  barry tells me hes not even  trying to get out of prison   mom hes here dads here  hes here   yeah hes here  why did you do this   we were trying to teach  you a lesson  you idiots   if he sees me with wayne   well be stuck with barry  i shall duck behind that little garbage car  guys a pro   and now ladies and gentlemen  michelangelos the creation of adam   and george michael made his debut  hey thats my yikes   breaking the pageants  cardinal rule    how dare he  oh stop booing theres nothing wrong with it  there are dozens of us dozens  buster arrived with lucille austero  and naturally assumed the yells of  disgust were directed toward him   what is wrong with you  whats wrong with you  buster  oh god im sorry  im sorry lucille yeah lucille  ma im sorry  man that old lady has really  done a number on you hasnt she  but george michael wasnt the  only problem with the painting   where is god  there is no god  there goes my credit card payment  dad dad  hey dad   excuse me  dad  hey dad get back here   no im not going back  dad come here   dad  michael im onto you  the spanish lessons the lawyer   if youre heading for portugal  its due south   what no it isnt  dad youre not gonna outrun me in that dress   let go for gods sakes im not even  wearing a jock   dad are you going too  no one is going to portugal you idiot  lindsay and i broke dad out of  jail for a day to catch mom on a date  your mother is on a date oh  dad   oh oh   buzzing    dad    and so many in the bluth family  gathered together for christmas eve at prison   hey whered your muscle  suit go  wait you knew  yeah  i took it off  you did  you have made some tremendous strides today  ever get the feeling like you dont even matter  only when im around my children  you reach a certain age and you have  to practically scream to get noticed  they turn you into a  monster and then they call you one  i dont think youre a monster  and i think youre a lovely girl  you know what  i think you and i ought to  spend more time together  yeah   thatll drive them crazy  exactly   and michael  was forced to once again  call in the counsel of barry zuckerkorn  thank you thank you for  coming down on christmas eve  oh its like any other  day except that i bill double  so theyre not filing charges  i got them to call your flee  from justice religious expression   this is a lawyer   yeah hes hes very good  youre gonna have to forfeit  that bond i was way off about that  thanks again mikey   can i ask you a question  sure  are all the guys in here you know  oh no no no not all of them  yeah its never the ones you hope   hope  think   howd it go  well the bad  news is youre in debt again  and we never busted mom  and were stuck with barry  the good news is weve been asked  never to participate in the pageant again  well at least were  still pals huh   yeah  thats not really doing it for me this time  yeah
