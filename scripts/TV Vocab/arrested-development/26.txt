i had that idea 10 months ago   you had that idea  well basically  i was gonna boil myself alive into a chowder and then be ladled into a giant cauldron   to entertain and feed the firemen  thats pretty close  i should be in this poof     michael bluth  he found him ice found your father   michael recently had hired a bounty hunter  to track down his fugitive father   whwhere  hes coming over

everybody wins  yeah  oscar close it you look like the window of a butcher shop   thank god i can finally get rid of him  ill see you at 500 mom   michael then headed down to the frozen banana stand  where his son was supposed to be working  it just seems like every time we wanna be together your father comes along  hey guys whats going on whys the banana stand closed  oh ann came to see me so i

with me  well when you get a full guest list let me know  why cant i do this anymore  thats got to bother you huh dad   i mean shes flirting right in front of you  hmm oh no  i am surprised though that shes going after somebody so similar to my own type  but i suppose we all do expose our inner desires dont we  i think you just did  no i didnt  is there any way i can divorce them  oh sure its called emancipation  but youve got to prove that youre living in an unstable environment  both my parents are trying to have affairs of course they havent succeeded yet  if they do i could have you out of this house on the street in a month   sweet  mmhmm   soon michael arrived and ice began his presentation  when word got out that he was building houses for saddam hussein  he escaped to mexico where as you know he was arrested and interred in a local prison  until he was killed by this guard  body was held for six days within the prison walls when    im sorry he killed a guard  no the guard killed him  hes dead buried in mexico     uh hhold on how do we know this is true  because i have here his dental records his death certificate  and a political cartoon from a leading mexican publication  okay again im a caterer  so if you do have any family events weddings wakes  ill leave my card  is it true  is he really gone   ow  just checking  these are his teeth he had such perfect

 ill be the one buried  because he loved magic so very much   i dont think gob knows what hes saying  i know exactly what im saying  i will be buried in my fathers place  and then one week later i will emerge from the grave  in one of the greatest illusions ever   this about getting into poof  i mean how does that not get me a cover     buster   we cant tell him about this  i think the boys been lied to enough  you werent here for the parakeet oscar   as a child buster had a beloved parakeet  who after landing on their housekeeper roses wig flew away   when she took out the trash and into a transformer    when buster found out he destroyed the familys kitchen  believing this to be where rosa lived   whoa  what are you doing home  the army had half a day   are you guys planning a party  yes  its your fathers birthday which coincidentally is my birthday  because youre twins   well ive got some shopping to do    george michael meanwhile hadjust been broken up with  by his first girlfriend  and was on his way home   and he went to his father for comfort  dad  ive got some bad news  what what is ann telling everyone  its your grandfather   apparently hes dead  are you okay

need you to do is to spin it around  to show everybody that theres no trap door  then im gonna escape out the trap door   ooh  you close the trap door  bring in the pallbearers and bury an empty box  so its a hoax  but why are you doing a coffin trick on dads birthday  black humor  say hey dad look at you youre a year older  and a year closer to death  oh yeah i guess thats kinda funny  okay but you have to do a favor for me  im not really in the army and i told mom i was  but i cant go to a family event without an army uniform   oh yeah i used to be a stripper  strippers dont wear clothes  not at the end of the show  you can wear stripper clothes when youre not stripping  you tell me   george michael went for a walk in the adjoining lot  to grieve both losses in private  and he made an interesting discovery   poppop  hide me  dont turn in poppop help poppop   george michael snuck his grandfather into the attic and helped him clean up   wow theyre perfect  years of brushing with glisten  listen you cant tell anybody im up here   you have to protect me  yeah i know   i just i cant not tell my father  im your grandfather   i went through hell to get here   he had  after being arrested he found a loophole in the mexican judicial system  i have uh i have money  the mexican authorities  even attempted to fake his funeral   although it was a lessthanperfect deception    anyway i was halfway down to panama and i saw something in the local paper   what he saw was a story  about his wife giving mouthtomouth to a homeless man  bue he knew the truth she was kissing his brother  well i understand what that feels like i was dumped today  i cant tell dad how upset i am about it because hell think i should just be upset about you   he wouldnt be wrong   what  seems like were going through the same thing   why dont we keep each others secrets  yeah okay  listen if you pass a minimart poppop gets a treat   the next morning   michael ran into his son doing something suspicious  morning   hi  where are you goin with that food  i was just gonna eat some of my grandfathers favorite foods in my room  its the form that my grief is taking  okay  i think george michaels hiding ann in the attic   from who the nazis  no his girlfriend from me  i just caught him sneaking up to her in the attic  and he clearly did so because he thinks i dont approve  i think im gonna invite her to the wake   why make him hide why do to him what    why do to him what dad used to do to me   he was so amazing  that was actually an example of how not so amazing he was  youre really going through something here huh  i know  you know its funny all those years when i pretended to cry  i used to use dads death to get me going  i tried it with moms but id just end up smiling and ruining it  but it feels like real you know  and you havent really allowed yourself to grieve much at all michael  my relationship with dad was much more much more complicated than yours  it was predicated a lot on secrets and lies there wasnt a lot of trust there  here he comes  here comes john wayne  im not gonna cry about my pa  im gonna build an airport put my name on it  why michael so you can fly away from your feelings  you can keep em bottled up but they will come out michael  sometimes in the most unexpected  hey where the  are my hardboiled eggs   meanwhile gob was preparing for the illusion ofbeing buried alive  boy you sure got this hole dug out quick  in fact the laborer had been hired by george sr three days earlier  for the same hole  and buster searched for the perfect card  someone wanted to send you a birthday greeting see you soon  oh that is wicked     and soon the wake that ice had catered began   what are you doing is this what youre wearing  my fathers dead maeby  yeah but youre not and ice is right there   maeby knew that if she could get her mother to have an affair  she could emancipate  all poppop ever wanted was to see you with another man besides daddy  youre right  you know what  im gonna throw on a skirt take off my underwear and make your poppop proud  let me ask barry that might be enough right there  is oscar wearing my suit  hey  you tell my brother you dont wear a dead mans pants  shame on him and you say that to him you say shame on you   okay  say it to me like youre gonna say it to him  im probably not gonna say it to him  okay  look at her down there does she look sad to you   oh my god thats ann  who  its the girl who ripped my heart out  the girl whose face will always be etched in my mind  her  shes really funny  well lets hope so  dont forget the chicken wings  hey ann youre here thats great   i wasnt sure whether you got my message  it wasnt a message   we talked  uh ann  did dad invite you  i figured lifes too short you two care for each other why throw that away huh  huh okay   do you think we really do  a father can tell okay  its as ann as the nose on plains face   and buster arrived  dressed in the military outfit gob had procured for him   what the hell are you wearing  its all regulation michael  to get the top right the pants had to be a little snug  to get the top right the pants had to be a little snug  is there a birthday gift pile hmm  a birthday gift pile   michael recalled what buster did to what he thought was roses car  with what he thought was roses favorite toy   hey   yours is the first  and the most wicked   get him out of here we cant let him know its a wake  buster   lets go get that coffin ready to be buried     and so the family gathered to remember george sr  if anyone would like to say anything about dad  nows the time   anyone  anyone  perhaps my son george michael would like to say something  huh wanna share your feelings eh   its okay to cry pal its okay  yeah  wow hes really gone  but i think that ifhe was here right now  i would probably tell him that it all worked out  and that um  ill be bringing you some salmon rolls right away  in heaven  how many times i gotta tell this kid chicken wings   lindsay got up to speak in an outfit her daughter had chosen  my father meant the world to me     wipe mom give it a wipe  thats a home run   and finally michael got up to speak  i had a very complicated relationship with my father    ice can we can we just cool it on the smoothies for right now  there are smoothies  i could never trust my father  but i always want my son to be able to trust me  so from now on  were always gonna be honest with each other  okay  cause theres nobody i love more than you in this whole world  michael listen can we move the eulogy outside  so i can time being lowered into dads grave with your big finish   im done  wow that was your eulogy  glad dad wasnt around to see that   that was great  well i meant it  so no more secret trips up to the attic right   george michael didnt want to betray his grandfather  but it appeared his father already knew the truth   i have poppop in the attic  what  the mere fact that you call making love poppop tells me youre not ready  hey before we lose the sun  come on  the speeches we heard today are nothing more than words  but i will prove that i love my father more than anybody     buster     stop it  as you can see this is a normal coffin  take me halfway around    i will become my dead fathers body  as i am lowered into his grave   all right spin it back around  dead father  is he de dads dead  just keep it together buster and spin this back around  oh my god the card the card     somethings gone wrong      how about that   michael noticed something
