me  l li can just see you showing  up on some lucky girls porch  in a tuxedo with a bottle of champagne  yeah well if i show up with all that stuff  i could probably just get away  with shorts and a tshirt right  which is good cause i dont even have a tuxedo  so youre saying theres no  one youre even interested in   in fact michael  had become enamored of marta  when gob was having second  thoughts about the relationship   ive made a huge mistake   but when gob recommitted to her   ive made a huge  mistake  michael  decided to do the noble thing and let her go  there was somebody for a while but  it was too much of a brother bother  that cant feel good  its fine im over it  im okay by myself you know  i really just want to  focus on my familys happiness  thats why i threw this  party i mean 14 years huh  youve got to be doing somethin right  well if you call not filing  for divorce something right   but i guess we keep it  interesting  wheres tobias  hes on the balcony having  margaritas with carl weathers   tobias had recently hired  actor carl weathers as a drama coach  do you see me more as the  respected dramatic actor  or more the beloved comic actor  whoa whoa whoa whoa theres  still plenty of meat on that bone  you take this home throw it in a  pot add some broth a potato  baby you got a stew goin  yes thats fine but i would like  to focus on my acting mr weathers  i did give you my last 1100  let me tell you a little story about acting  i was doing this showtime  movie hot ice with anne archer  never once touched my per diem  i go to craft service get some  raw veggies bacon cup of soup   chuckles baby i had a stew goin  i think id like my money back   like his father george  michael had been nursing an impossible crush  it was on his cousin maeby  and with no one to talk to he was  looking for some kind of direction  just give me a sign   chuckles first ones obvious okay   he continued to look for a sign   until finally  maybe tonight   chuckling what are the chances   actually maybe  tonight was a very popular candy slogan  and the chances were one in eight   what are you  doin  just tryin  to throw stuff at my dads head  but the wind keeps  taking it   oh cool  so i uh i found this  i thought it was like a  oneinamillion thing it  just made me think of you  oh perfect    trying to make my relation   i saw that   and lucille  found a way to force a wedge  into her sons relationship  lucille guess whos coming to dinner  ive invited carl to dine with us next tuesday  mother you know i have class on tuesday  oh how silly of me  well then perhaps the two  of you can have dinner alone  oh well i never say no to  dinner with a beautiful lady that is   do you like ham  no i love it   laughing   and the family  gathered to watch a videotape  george sr had sent lindsay  and tobias for their anniversary  hello im george bluth  and for the next 45 minutes  let me take you on a journey  good grief he sent us  one of his idiot videotapes    first  this   announcer  youve seen george bluth on videotape  you have got to learn to be alone  i cheated and i lied and i whored around  caged wisdom changed my life   announcer

valentines day party  speaking of which  lupe where are those balloons   you want balloons  speech speech speech  joining in speech  speech speech speech speech  speech speech speech speech   come on speech   speech speech speech speech   the family continued to  chant speech speech speech  for no one in particular   speech speech  all right  speech  after all that i was kinda  hoping somebody would make a speech   speech speech  speech  all right  all right all right ill say something   typical  weve all had  a tough couple of months  i think were all really  figuring out who we are  and what we really need in life  and that can be painful  however you cant really heal yourself  until you stop living a lie you know  but uh li promise that were all  gonna be a lot happier in the long run  so on a very unusual valentines day  cheers to mom and dad to buster and lucille    chuckling dont forget my  girlfriend   thats who i meant    chuckling dont forget my  girlfriend   thats who i meant  to lindsay and tobias to george michael and  i almost said george  michael and maeby  chuckles   oh  laughing  um to gob and marta   mmm  to love and happiness  i love you all marta   and marta  realized it was michael not gob  who had everything she had  been looking for in a man  i made a huge mistake  i was thinking about that toast  you gave at my anniversary party  so i want to get a divorce   what  do you think i should use our attorney  barry or just kind of bolt in the night  im leaning toward bolt in the night but  whoa whoa whoa lindsay i  wasnt talking about getting a divorce  oh michael  its time  the mans psychologically  incapable of taking all of his clothes off   in fact tobias was a nevernude  as of yet the dsm  iv has  not acknowledged the affliction  i dont know lindsay i mean who am i to judge  on the other hand i am doing it anyway  so let me suggest before you talk  divorce at least consider a separation  you know you do have a kid   i know  i was gonna take her with me in  the night shes part of the bolt  lindsay  all right ill think  about it    hey brother  i just want to tell you how much  i enjoyed your speech yesterday  you know about family and  and being true to ourselves  oh well im im glad it made an impact  yeah i never want to look at mom again   sighs what happened  well i cant really talk  she might be listening in  do you know she tried to set  up my girlfriend with a man   buster this has to stop  you know thats not really what i was going for  im a man mike im a man  can i throw out this yogurt  buster two things  first of all i think it might be  time for you to move out you know  secondly you dont want to take any chances  with yogurt mom just let her throw it out  hehello whos on  this phone   hey huh    michael  hey   great speech last  night  oh really  what did it inspire you to do kill somebody  getting there martas cheating on me   what  yeah can you believe that  thats crazy gob shes not a cheater if she  were to cheat id like to think shed cheat   youre the cheater   thats how i know all the signs  last night she was all distant and weird  wouldnt let me make love to her on moms bed  i dont even want to tell you what she  wouldnt let me do to her in the car  and then today i overhear her talking on  the phone about somebody all super silently  all in spanish   in fact marta was on the  phone with her mother talking about michael   speaking spanish    spanish     marta hermano  she kept using this guys name like hermano  let me tell you something were gonna track  this hermano down and were gonna nail him  cause if anyones gonna go out with  that girl its gonna be one of us   right me  and im okay with that  i dont get it why do we have to change rooms  cousins of the opposite  gender shouldnt be sharing a room  but thats just the point i mean were  cousins gender has nothing to do with it  i mean cousins can bunk together  thats why they call it bunkin cousins   kissin cousins  were  not kissing thats the point   george michael was concerned  that tobias had seen the candy heart  that said maybe tonightand had  figured out that he had a crush on his cousin  besides i dont even care you said share  a room with her i shared a room with her  now youre saying dont share a room with  her fine im just doing whatever you say  you know the adults making all the  decisions around here why am i in trouble  youre not in trouble were all just  gonna have a more normal arrangement  im gonna sleep with my daughter  and youre gonna sleep with my husband   buster had taken michaels  advice and decided to confront his mother   sniffing  because you know i dont  appreciate how you treat me  i am not a child mother   sniffs   sighs blow  no mother i can blow myself  and you have interfered for the last time  fine go move out   so buster  loaded up his possessions  and emancipated himself from his mother    oh hey buster i thought you had class  i thought you had class my  brotherinlaw fires you   and you move in on my  girlfriend  come  on now wait a minute  this is purely a social call you know  just two adults gettin a stew on man  i dont know what that  means but it sounds disgusting  hey buster gee i thought you had class  i thought you had class  i want to move in with you  im tired of my mom trying to control me  wait a minute are you sure youre  doing this because you want to be with me   and not because you want to get even with  your mother  this  isnt about my mother  besides its the only way im  ever gonna get her to respect me  buster this is exactly why  our relationship does not work  our relationship  doesnt work   not as lon  as you keep getting me mixed up with your mother  it is exactly the opposite  im leaving my mother for you  youre replacing my mother  you need some time  huh     meanwhile michael  was following marta to confirm  gobs suspicions about her affair  first he saw her buy a  present at an exclusive mens store  the trail then led michael to the set  of martas spanish language soap opera  excuse me im looking for hermano    mi hermano ahi  mmm   there in the green  great thanks  gracias  mmhmm    speaking spanish  hermano   are you hermano   mi hermano  es ahi   thats the guy who just  mmhmm   son of a bitch     hey   spanish   marta     i had to see you he moved out  moved out buster did   i

at the model home   buster bluth  hey brotherinlaw  good news carl got me an audition   carl  weathers  i think the  world is about to fall in love  with frightened inmate 2  well at least he gave you something  carl weathers took everything from me  my entire life just came  crashing down and its all his fault  i will never love again   hello  oh my god   is everything okay   and suddenly  buster realized marta was the most  beautiful woman he had ever seen  ive been dating an old lady  is michael here   li dont i dont know  where he is    in fact   michael was just returning from his  day of following  marta    well i lost her   michael  marta   im so glad i caught you  you caught me   yes  oh  first of all thank you so  much for the lovely party  and for making me feel so welcome in your

lets get to the  bottom of this hermano stuff brother   yep great  great  hey about dinner id love to   tobias arrived at his  audition for frightened inmate 2   chattering  the competition frightened tobias which  he felt he could use in his performance  unfortunately this made him more confident  which frightened him again  im ready   that night maeby  moved in to lindsays room  isnt this fun its like a slumber party  hmm  thats it tell me whats up with you and dad  nothing nothings wrong with your father and me  we have a a wonderful close relationship  can i let you in on a little secret  hmm having him in the next room  makes me miss him all the more  mom please hes got a  bigboy crush on action jackson  i know how can i compete with that  okay were having a little fight right now  but dont worry darling okay  mommy and daddy arent going anywhere  okay im gonna go unpack my suitcase  no we may have to bolt   tobias moved in  to george michaels room  maeby and i were cool with each  other and you must miss your wife  its practically still your anniversary  fourteen years of lies  yes im the doctor the perfect husband  the big manly man the big strong daddy  do you know the last time  that i made love to my wife   no  ill tell you when   no dont  see nothing  has ever been easy for us  i mean the only reason she went out  with me was to piss offher boyfriend  the only reason she ever  married me was to piss off her mother  and then of course we couldnt  conceive so there was that famous ordeal   whwhat do you mean you couldnt  conceive was maeby  adopted     what is she not really related to  me is she just some girl i know  ah its carl weathers yes carl weathers  i did thats thats wonderful   thats   phone beeps  huh i booked it i booked the acting job  did you hear that lindsay you could have  been sleeping with frightened inmate 2   and lucille was  experiencing being alone for the first time  unable to sleep she decided to watch tv   george you have got to learn to be alone   then she remembered  that with no one to disturb  she could turn up the  volume as loud as she wanted   caged wisdom teaches you that  you have to find thejoy within yourself      and thats when lucille realized   that shejust might like being alone  after all     show tune continuing   the next night michael  had dinner with marta at her house  hoping to finally get the  answers he was looking for  so um about gob hows that goin  well as you said  finding out who you  really are it can be painful   but you cant live a lie  no i cant  but some people find a way to make that work  yes but sometimes working at something  its a way to not deal with some other thing  but he who often suggests  uh working on another thing   which when the first thing is  not   will you excuse me for a moment  yes sure   what the hell is he talking  about  what is  she talking about  can i have a  piece of cake   and michael saw an opportunity  to get the information he wasnt  getting from marta from her son  ill tell you what i got  i got a deal for you partner  ill give you what you want  if you give me what i want  tell me everything you know abouthermano   hermano   does  your mother love hermano  si mi hermano   hes here  shh hes sleeping   dont go in  there  why is there  something you dont want me to see  what are you  talking about   w  can keep going around in circles  but maybe one of us should just come  out and say what it is we want to say  youre right   its not working with gob   why doesnt he know that  you know you could have  just come out and told him  you know instead of lying and  sneaking around moving on to the next guy  i didnt think you were that kind of a  person i thought you and  i shared the same values  i thought you and i couldve been uh  no forget it eh i dont  know how i had you so wrong  youre right  i should have told him before i invited you here  this can never be   then he noticed  the gift he had seen her buy   sighs   what does te amo mean  i love you  hmm  and whos in there  mi hermano  brother  ive made a huge mistake  on the next arrested development  george michael begins an investigation  so
