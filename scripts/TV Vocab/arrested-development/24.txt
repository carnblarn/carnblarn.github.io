                now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything  and the one son who had no choice  but to keep them all together  its arrested development   michael bluth was at home working on a plan to save the company  hows this for a business model we make the company look like its in the black  by starting construction on the phase two development  i know what youre thinking were not in the black  howre we gonna build 30 houses without any money we dont we build one  then we have a huge ribboncutting ceremony while raising funds for the others   michaels father always unveiled his construction projects  with a highly publicized ribboncutting ceremony  he even did so for the prison he built  and somewhat ironically would later occupy  the only difference is this time i get to cut the ribbon what do you think  theres a cream with real diamonds in it  i can actually smear diamonds on my face and its only 400 a tub  thats like what like a million diamonds for 400   mm  a million  diamonds   okay  is she on you about that diamond cream  my husbands jealous because since we decided to have an open marriage  ive been doing a little better than he has  it is not a competition lindsay  we are doing this to save our marriage  but i should be telling you that i have been meeting my fair share of groupies  or should i say bluepies   tobias had recently auditioned as an understudy  for the silent performance art trio the blue man group   and this is kids from bye bye birdie     he had yet to hear back from them  you guys really think you have the guts to go through with this seeing other people thing   in fact neither lindsay nor tobias did have the guts to go through with it   i already have  i have too  can i buy you a drink   no   lindsay because shed lost her selfconfidence  id like to buy you a drink wheres she going   and tobias because he was busy keeping an eye on lindsay  who are you gonna bring to this ribboncutting dance  its not a dance and you dont need a date although george michael  id love for you to come with me when i cut the ribbon at the new house  oh wow hey can i bring ann  who  ann you know shes shes the girl im kinda hanging out with   i havent met ann  yes you have    michael had met ann  you let her in  see thats her right over there   oh ann yes yes yes yes  yeah  i know ann hey you shes got a little hardboiled egg going there  oh its so cute she sometimes takes a little pack of mayonnaise  and shell squirt it in her mouth and then shell take an egg  and kind of mmm  she calls it a mayonnegg   are you okay  i dont feel so good  you know i kind of wanna buy her a diamond   her  ann  i know i cant afford it but aunt lindsay was telling me about this diamond cream  george michael um im sure that egg is a very nice person i just dont want you spending   its ann her na  all your money getting her all glittered up for easter  you know more importantly i want us to do this together  kinda like a fatherson sort of thing you know  and since poppop is no longer president we get to do it   i thought gob was president  yeah and i dont have any problem with that   in fact since michaels father escaped from prison  his brother gob had been made president albeit in name only  which is why michael was surprised when he got to work the next day   youre still in my office  gosh michael i am kind of the president  and i have no problem with that but it is just a title remember  just doing this to appease the stockholders while they scrutinize me for dads crimes  hey dad may have illegally built some homes in iraq which is kinda not cool  i know but thats why ive got a business model  that i think is going to restore the image of our company  were going to build a second model home  thats great can i announce it to the board  gee it is my business model  if you had a business model then by all means go in there and do your little dance  tell you what were gonna do rock paper scissors for it   no no im not interested in doing  one two three   paper covers rock  it is a rock though it should beat everything  theres not a lot of logic to it its like on a boat with women and children first  why should theywhich before i forget im buying a company boat  sorry   that morning gob had gone to a boat show where he saw something he wanted   hello  hi   what a beauty  thank you   i meant you  well   gob flirted with her for a while and finally asked for her number   lets get some digits  im sorry i dont give it out without a firm offer  oh ill make you a firm offer   unfortunately she wasnt flirting  and here again please   the seaward  youre not getting a boat   one two three  no not gonna do it   paper covers rock  fine but rock sinks boat   michael  mom im right in the middle of something   get rid of the seaward  ill leave when im good and ready  its about your uncle oscar i want him to move in with you  youre not kicking him out already are you   michaels uncle had recently moved into lucilles apartment  where they quickly rekindled a longdormant romance   it was a secret she hoped to keep  oscar well be heard   and he didnt  thats what makes it so hot   mother  mother   i heard zoo noises  its nothing go back to bed  so everybodys still up huh    its not fair to buster hes a nervous wreck right now  hes going into the army for gods sake  you volunteered him  i knew you were going to throw that in my face  dont worry about it okay theyre never gonna take him anyway   at that moment buster was taking his physical at the recruitment center  i dont have a hole in my heart ive never opened my eyes underwater  my  reproductive organ  is shaped like  a lobster tail  but without its shell hmm  oh i guess i have the panic attacks under control  oh and im legally blind at night   but buster had miscalculated the armys current need for personnel  okay then lets get you fitted for a uniform  what what  hey why dont you volunteer oscar that would solve both of your problems  hed never cut his hair   that hair  listen oscars your problem im taking care of everything else in this family  including starting construction on a second model home  were having a ribboncutting ceremony  we cant have a ribboncutting without your father and hes god knows where   george sr was in mexico  with his escape accomplice and exsecretary kitty  i keep eating so many eggs it must be my unconscious desire to have a baby  oh my god can you even imagine how cute the combination of the two of us would be  i mean were all out of prophylacticos anyway  somebody used the last two on his feet to walk across the bathroom floor   but he was growing tired of their confined intimacy   ive made a huge mistake  hey its me   dad  yeah listen i gotta make this quick  youre the only one who can save the family but you gotta keep the company strong  because im gonna need some of that money later  i will dad its funny after all these years of   you making fun of me for the magic shows and  gob  oh for gods i called to talk to michael you horses         gob was hurt  bye pop  hey whoa whoa was that dad  yeah i had to uh jump off  you just had dad on the phone where was he  no way to tell really portugal   down south america way  well did he wanna talk to me  no he wanted to talk to the president   i have no problem with that   michael was also hurt  and george sr was brutally hurt  when he was mistaken for his twin brother oscar     marijuana no no  thats my brother brothero brothero   that night lindsay headed to the club  to try again to meet someone  soon having struck out again she spotted a man who looked interesting  he had the lean look effortless hair  and dresseddown manner of a movie star   buy me a drink  i think the bars closing  i know a place   it was at that point that lindsay had a startling revelation   uh uh uh you get out get out get out out out out   no homeless in here  homeless youre homeless  youre gross oh god    theyre taking me in the army they didnt think there was enough wrong with me     well did they check everything  yes they even touched my charlie browns you lied to me   you said i wasnt fit to serve  okay hold on  lets calm down people  um i think i know a little bit about avoiding combat duty  now which pinkie do you use less  are you nuts do you know what i went through to have this boy  oh i know where the boy came from  wait why were you in the pantry  and lucille realized it was time to end  whatever it was she had with oscar  so i believe its a good plan  the next day michael was ready to wow the board with his new business model  as i told my brother the president  if we start construction on a second model home  we can be cutting this ribbon within two months  i said thats why youre no longer president  two weeks lets do it in two weeks hey    im sorry im sorry can we stop the music     im not as optimistic that we can get that done  gob i think we both agree that we would do things your way  if you had a business model  do you have a business model gob  i am so happy that you asked me that michael  because i just happen to have a business model right here   solid as a rock  meet starla the new bluth company business model  for our phase two campaign  bluth homes solid as a rock  well see you at the ribboncutting in two weeks  if my brother doesnt screw it up first   hey   gob had committed michael to building a model home in two weeks  we cant build a house in two weeks also im not sure how solid as a rock  helps people forget the fact that we built houses in iraq   i love that  but you probably know best because youre president  we dont have to build a real house michael  like you said its all for appearances anyway we throw up a couple of walls   we build a fake one  what are you talking about  nothing on the inside  ill never get a crew to build it theyd lose their licenses  then you build it yourself damn it  hey there she is my little business model  sorry about that build it yourself crap  i might take her to the ribboncutting   you end up finding a date yet  no   as michael grew frustrated by his relationship with gob  lucille tried to end hers with oscar   i want you out of the house  oh i want you everywhere  oscar no i cant have this in my life anymore im a married woman  lucille you wanna leave i wont chase after you  but before you do ask yourself wheres your husband  because i am here i am real i am flesh and blood  and hair  oh god that hair   what will people say  theyll say those people are in love     that night the evening news report said something very different   lucille bluth caught on tape breathing life into a homeless man  the surprising home video at 1000   and michael prepared to build a house  two weeks but what if my dates not available  im trying to get a lastminute crew together your inability to get a man interested   is not at the top of my list  oh ive got a man interested michael   whats wrong with him  theres nothing wrong with him  he is homeless  well i didnt know he was homeless at the time   it was humiliating  is this about gangys homeless guy   gangys homeless guy  yeah its all over the news  gangy gave cpr to a homeless guy on the beach   lindsay felt respect for her mother  and decided that perhaps she could overcome her pride and help someone too  ive got someone for your crew michael my boyfriend the homeless guy   i wonder if he even has an apartment or     hello   did you see the news  your uncle oscar forced himself on me at the beach today   and i didnt have my horn  of course  it was uncle oscar mom youre not having an affair with him are you  youre building a house i want you to give it to him   its not a real house  perfect hes not a real man   and george sr made his case to the mexican police  my god i was beaten up here im telling you im george im not oscar im george   the cornballer  ss the cornballer   george sr had marketed a device called the cornballer in mexico  after the severe burns it caused led to it being banned in the us   why did you have one  ss   lindsay meanwhile was having trouble finding her homeless man   he looked like a movie star  the man looked like a movie star because he was a movie star  his name was tom jane and he was making two movies for a major studio  one was a gritty personal project about a junkies life  which he got to do in exchange for making  a rigidly formulaic popcorn movie   he was living on the streets researching his role  hey homeless guy   hey  im not proud of the way  i was so grossed out when i found out you were gross before  you really thought i was gross huh  well at first i thought you were kind of hot but i hadnt looked closely enough  listen i have a construction job for you  and if you clean yourself up who knows you might actually get a date out of this   okay  see ya  okay weve all made some sacrifices to be here but we all want the same thing   i wanna live here  i wanna buy ann some diamond dust  im just hoping to get mildly injured so i can get out of the army  bottom line is weve got two weeks to build a house  it doesnt have to be good it just has to look good  i just want my kids back   and so the guys went to work        things didnt go smoothly at first  buster looked for ways to hurt himself  but soon the project came together  when gob stopped by  now were building a house   yeah im pretty proud  so what do you think did i do this or what  seems like your brother did it  my brother does what i tell him to do im the president  wheres your p  what oh no not again   i got it    hey sorry for the my brother does what i tell him to do crap  but i want this to be perfect for when i cut the ribbon tomorrow  youre cutting the ribbon  i kinda thought that since i built it   i might go ahead and give it a  yeah okay  can you imagine how that would look to the board  the construction worker cutting the ribbon no no thats a job for the president   michael had a problem with that   gob had taken away something michael always wanted  you got the p  now it was michaels turn to take something from gob starla  and later michael set about his plan  gob do you have starlas phone number  i got a few business things id like to go over with the business model  guess who was just over her dont ill tell you me   hmm  l  the business model   actually theyjust made out  yeah she had all kinds of orgasms  imagine that i finally nailed somebody that you werent after  thats it ive worked too hard and too long for you to keep getting all the credit  i built that company that house and im gonna be cutting the ribbon  whether were all pretending that youre president or not  yeah sure i just wanted   you just wanted what  i just wanted you to be impressed with me  dad never was never said a nice thing about me  he called you the other day he didnt even wanna talk to me  of course he did he never wants to talk to me he never has   cut the ribbon  really   yeah how about that  michael  i have no problem with it   all right take it easy come on  thank you   the next day the bluth family prepared to unveil phase two     have you seen your uncle gob around  no and i cant find that diamond dust that aunt lindsay bought for me  oh well your aunt lindsay has probably taken it shes just a taker  this is your chance huh with the big ribboncutters after all these years  well actually i figured give gob a chance you know  the guy doesnt get a whole lot of attention in this family  ladies and gentlemen the president of the bluth company gob bluth  my brother wasnt optimistic it could be done  but i didnt take wasnt optimistic it could be done  for an answer  ladies and gentlemen i present to you phase two of the bluth company   a house truly solid as a rock        but as it turns out  michael was right to not be optimistic it could be done     and buster saw the chance to get injured enough  to keep him out of the army     but instead   got a glimpse inside   i cant look at that   unfortunately tobias had to  i got the wrong homeless man i am sorry i was looking for lindsay  you lied to me you both lied to me im gointo war   buster you cant  yes i can  i dont agree with your dirty doings here  but i will defend with my life your right to do it  you planned this all along didnt you michael   no i didnt i had no crew i had no time  you set me up   gob charged at michael with the scissors  but michael as he always did picked rock    you wanted to make me look foolish  put down the scissors   put em down  foolish with scissors   which beat scissors  unfortunately the whole incident was covered by the paper  nobody looks good in this   especially that little dude  thats ann   whos  it doesnt matter listen  you know i didnt set you up okay i think the only reason you and i always fight  is that since we were little kids dads always played us off each other  dad always said that was your fault  anyway what we oughta do is make a decision right now  not to let dad get in the middle of our relationship anymore   hes not even in town and were fighting  were grown men   yeah lets just move on  look at me im the president of a company now     oh thats dads line i bet he saw the paper  listen if you want my respect you wont answer that okay  its just gonna cause more problems    hello they hung up  they hung up on me hiya guys  i couldnt get the money i dont know what happened   im impressed you hung up  did i hang up   i meant to hit speaker  oh   you gotta hit the line first  im hitting both at the same time   these are the lines theres a line here  but she said   its line and then  hey  i dont wanna wait until dads dead for us to get along   but it was too late  as george sr would be declared dead  within the hour   from now on we support each other  we start with a clean slate   yeah  we almost did it though didnt we  we almost pulled it off   no it wasnt even close  yeah a lot of people got hurt   this was very very bad  not great not great   on the next arrested development  lindsay finds out the true identity ofher homeless man  look youre a really nice chick but im not homeless  im tom jane  and even though lindsay doesnt know who that is  hearing that he isnt homeless is good enough for her   buy me a drink  youre really sweet but no  im tom jane   and lindsay crushed and alone  for the first time misses her husband   tobias    lindsay im  is that george michaels diamond cream  oh yes well i ran out of blue and i couldnt find anything else  i think my nipples are bleeding though i dont know if youre supposed to use quite this much     that guys a jerk  no i am  no no i am  because i think i need to go to the hospital right away  and see if i cant get some of this diamond dust vacuumed from out of my lungs  this way
