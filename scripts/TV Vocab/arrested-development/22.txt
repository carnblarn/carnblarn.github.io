she knows  michael you can save this business  you are the only one who can do it  yeah besides me right but i kind  of got my hands full with these babies   hes got bees  no bees   get it    they dont allow you to have bees in here   and business was  slow at the banana stand  when george michael  made a new friend   hi  hi   are bananas high in carbohydrates  oh youre on atkins too  uh yeah actually thats um  thats why im gonna be on on tv   you are  i  was interviewed  for hindsight with john beard  i uh i gave them a joke but i  dont know if theyre gonna use it  you know thanks to this diet  craze the last time we had a customer  the banana stand was still green  lose it no lose the whole kid  well just go with the iraq piece   thats so cool  i guess   you wanna watch over at my house  yeah li guess   and michael headed off to meet kitty  their last meeting had ended poorly  say goodbye to your company michael   and say goodbye to these  no no no no  so michael was understandably  anxious about their reunion  guess i do get to see  them again huh  chuckles  can we please have one conversation  thats not about my rack michael  yeah   maybe a  better question would be  what evidence do i have against you because  no no no i dont i dont wanna know  i just want to know what you want  id like to be in charge of the bluth company  well i want a hamburger and french fries  but i cant have the bun or potatoes get real  i deserve it your father promised  it to me on the day he went to prison  sounds like something that he would do  and if i cant be in charge then im  going to have to tell the entire world  that your father was building houses overseas   without paying  whoa  whoa whoa stop stop stop  act no finish finish  um without paying what taxes  model houses michael overseas  and he hid it   whispering from the us government  thats it thats what my  dads been hiding back taxes  and unless you plan on paying them  your dads gonna be in prison for a long time  no well pay them forget it well  just well mortgage the company if we have to  we found money for those well  find money for taxes good to see ya  yeah if i was in charge that  would have been my first move too   as michael returned  home george michael was heading out  to meet the girl from the banana stand  great news the business is gonna be okay  yeah i thought bananas would be okay on the diet  no li meant well you  havent been eating those have you   no no not at all just  some nuts   good those are fine  what i meant was i think were gonna  be seeing poppop sooner than we thought  huh does that sound good   do you hear that rattle  it is very worrisome   hey what the hell are you  doing  great news michael  were thinking of purchasing a bluth model home   and lets check the oven   clattering  whoa that doesnt inspire confidence  lindsay the bead business taking off is it  actually i am the  breadwinner michael as it turns out  i was walking in a strange place today  a place id never set foot in before   tobias walking down a  street hed been down many times  saw a book hed written  years earlier as a psychiatrist  the book initially  unsuccessful had suddenly caught fire  although strangely only in the gay community  the book is huge and i have a bit  of money coming my way as a result  so if youll excuse me im going  to go upstairs and run the shower  let me know if its too loud in the kitchen  okay honey  so your husband comes into some money and  suddenly hes not so oblivious anymore huh  hey now this is not me being shallow michael  hes written a selfhelp  book thats helping people  that does take some insight   listen  this better not mean youre  blowing off the bead store  well uh seeing as though you brought it  up maybe we should get out of this investment   i mean seriously michael  beads  i knew youd do this  you work for three seconds and you  find something easier and grab it  its dipapet all over again   lindsay also had a brief  foray into what she had then hoped   come back  here  would be the  burgeoning fad of custom pet coloring  well that wouldve worked if  youd sprung for a bigger sink  george michael our shows about to start   he went out on his date  a date  but we had plans to a date with who  some girl i mean she barely has a face  you couldnt pick her out of a lineup of one   but first the palaces of iraq  trisha tell us about these new  minipalaces of saddams youve discovered  our troops have been living  here for the last few days  and as you can tell theyve  made themselves right at home  now a lot of this damage is  just due to shoddy workmanship  but the real surprise here is that these homes  appear to be americanbuilt to begin with  there have been sanctions  against doing business  with husseins regime since the early 90s   so who built  them  does that  look a little like our kitchen island  well whoever it is  theyre in a world of trouble   michael realized  that his fathers crimes  might be bigger than he thought  theres a good chance i may  have committed some light treason  this might even be considered light treason  oh my god   michael hadjust found  out his father might have committed   michael hadjust found  out his father might have committed  some light treason by  building model homes in iraq  and he tried to get ahold of  kitty who he knew had the evidence  unfortunately kitty was  meeting with gob at the time   what about  hash browns  no  because hash browns are potatoes  so you really cant eat anything on this diet  wow wonder how this is  gonna affect my honey business  gob i have seen you get passed over  time and time again by your family  you dont deserve that youre smarter than them  what about macaroni let me finish salad  gob this is your time  with my help knowing what i know   we could take over the  bluth company together  wow  this is a side of you id never noticed before  have they always been that big   and the next day  michael went to his mothers  i saw an expos on the iraq palaces last night  and i could have sworn that one  of them was the sea wind unit  thats funny i always pictured  iraq in the middle of the desert  dad sold houses to the iraqis didnt he  and this is what you kept from me  so i could take the polygraph test  tell me the truth okay cause  theres been a lot of lying in this family  and a lot of love  more lies   look i  never knew about anything  but i had my suspicions  he never told me where he was going  but he used to come back from  those business trips reeking of lamb  and people would send  figs not even at christmas  in the middle of october  oh and once someone sent him a toe  and he went white as a sheet  i think youre right michael    gob realized that the power  play he promised to make with kitty   had perhaps come at a bad  time  ive  made a huge mistake  and tobias was having his first book reading  and tobias was having his first book reading  and for the ease of the reader i have  changed all the genderrelated pronouns  he she to the masculine he  the man inside me for lindsay my rock  i could not have done this without him   and lindsay  arrived to support her husband  for there is a man inside me  and only when hes finally out  can i walk free of pain  this book is gonna sell like a billion copies  lindsay oh im so glad you came  i was hoping for more women  perhaps i shouldnt have just used  he i think that was a mistake  and lindsay realized that tobias was  just as oblivious as shed always thought  tobias i dont think this  relationship is gonna work  what are you talking about  weve had some great times  weve got nothing left tobias  and michael went to confront his father  youre building houses in iraq i  mean do you know how they punish treason  first time   ive  never heard of a second  oh ive got the worst  beeps attorneys  this is why i didnt want to get  you involved but we can fix this   what are kittys demands what  does she want   she wants my job  suddenly everybody wants my job  and i shouldve given it to her  you mean you didnt michael she has  the evidence of what we did over there  no all she thinks it is is unpaid taxes  yeah what if she gives it to  someone whos even moderately intelligent   in fact kitty had gone  to someone moderately intelligent  in her continuing quest for  control of the bluth company   i cant believe you called me for a  date   you didnt tell anyone did you  are you kidding i dont need to brag  that some people havent even been on a date  day not over yet fatty  you werent thinking  clearly i mean none of us are  we need bread  if this information was so  damaging why didnt you just shred it  well saddam owed us money  you didnt realize that he wouldnt pay  your mom had a good feeling about him  so mom knew this entire time and  shejust lied to my face for months and months  let me tell you something dad this  is this is your problem okay not mine  well maybe it wouldnt be my problem if  you did what i asked for once in your life   and you gave kitty what i  asked you to   once in my damn life  all ive ever done my entire life is do  exactly what you told me to all right  ive done everything for this family  pop not anymore kitty can have my job  and you can take your own  polygraph test cause im done   im done with you and im  done with the  business  great  im gonna get a lethal injection  because my son wont eat a potato   george sr in a surprise move  volunteered to take the polygraph   so did you swipe the  sedative from the  infirmary   no   to lower your heart rate   no its okay i want to do this  because i want people to know i  never willfully deceived anyone  mistakes were made but i  never intended to hurt anyone  i was trying to support my family   he doesnt appear to be on a  sedative   but i  can see clearly now  sitting in this chair strapped to this  machine i can see that my  life has become a failure  ive let people down let myself down  but i love my country i love it here  you can shop i love my cant breathe   i cant breathe  wait  wait are you guilty yes or no   i think hes having a heart  attack  that  was not a nod no   that was not a nod  call an ambulance   siren wailing   oh how is he  stable  but they dont know if hes due for another one  its his own fault what kind of  diet is this its too much meat  i want all of you off this immediately  except you  tobias i cant believe you came  oh come on lindsay this is my family   and lindsay realized that  perhaps they did have something left  a real connection  also dale one of the  gentlemen from my reading  is a nurse here so we were  able to park right out front  oh barry did you talk to a doctor  i did i have poison oak  do you believe it where the hell did i get that     she was talking about  george  no hes the same  look i guess we should decide whos  gonna speak for the family i would  but i have laker tickets     buster knew this was his chance  to put kittys coup dtat in action  he wondered ifhe was up for it  someone might have to sign  the do not resuscitate form   and he decided he  wasnt  i need to  make a telephone call get out of something  im in charge now  i speak for this family  i mean li could if you wanted me to  id rather not  obviously dont know what id say  why do i have to be the one i dont need this  why does this have to  become my problem no im out  forget it find somebody else im sick of it   im sick of doing everything  for this family  where is michael    scoffs typical  did somebody call him   in fact they hadnt  and at that moment he was  determined to finally get   as far away from his  family as  possible  hey pal   pack your bags  where are we goin  anywhere joshua tree space  camp the baseball hall of fame  everything you and i have always wanted to do  but havent been able to because of this family   were just  gonna go  yeah and i  dont know if were even gonna come back   theres nothing  keeping us  here  well dad   i like it here  what the  hells going on with you lately  i wanted to watch  hindsight and you werent there  i want to pack up and desert  the family and you dont want to   is it this new girlfriend  no it  its because of the family i like the family   i mean if we leave whos gonna  take care of these  people  i dont know  the state or the police maybe the  magicians alliance will pick up some slack      hey thats gonna be  them and theyre gonna want something  were not answering that    hello   wheres george michael  exactly where is he  ever since hes been dating this  annie mcnoface hes been blowing me off   oh hey wheres poppop  room 212   and thats when maeby decided   and thats when maeby decided  that perhaps she could use her  uncle to make her cousin jealous  hey dad wait up  that was a waste of time    groaning  hows he doin  hes hanging in there  he keeps trying to get this i v  out ofhis arm i dont understand why  its just glucose  were all trying to stay away from sugar   hes gonna  be okay right   absolutely absolutely you all right  ill handle this one michael  dont you worry itll take a lot more  than a heart attack to kill that old bear   laughing old bear  he likes the honey  he never got a chance to  see my bee business take off  hey come on now dads gonna  be around another 30 years gob  your business uh might not  youre a good brother michael  heart attack never stop old big bear  i didnt even know we were calling him big bear   we never had a chance  to  hey hey come on gob  everybody im very sorry okay i  feel awful i should have been here  i was the one that was supposed to take that  polygraph test and then i just turned on him  and then this happened  but never again okay  i will never ever leave  this family no matter what   you shouldve been here   i feel like i covered that   well you  didnt say it  i  feel awful i should have been here  maybe youre right maybe i  didnt say it i should have been here   excuse me mr bluth  hmm   we lost him   all gasping  he just uh got away from us im sorry  uh can we go in there  if you want not a lot to see  maybe not for you but for us   and thats when the family  realized that george sr wasnt dead  but was fleeing the country  that he loved so very much  pack your bags  on the next season of arrested development  the family grapples with  the news they hadjust heard  why would a doctor say hes  gone when he means hes escaped  god ive missed bread mmm  wouldnt you say he left out the window  or the rooms empty  maebys life gets a little more complicated  its so obvious he gave himself the  shot to make it look like a heart attack   how could they not see that   maybe we should kiss again  and teach them a lesson about obvious  and kitty helps george sr escape
