                now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything  and the one son who had no choice  but to keep them all together  its arrested development   michael bluth was working at home when his son made a curious request  dad would anyone miss this peter and the wolf readalong record  no i think thats part of the model home decorations why  youre right my girlfriend ann wants to have a christian music bonfire here  that sounds like some mild fun i think weve got some christmas music  oh no its not its not a christian music bonfire its a christian music bonfire  you know we burn all satanic music  the thing is though the only music i have is either instructional or humor   hed been particularly fond of a cd of something called thejerky boys     hello   hey nitz hey jerky i wanna buy a house dad   its gotta be big  you said dad buddy   shut up jerky      hey george michael jesus called he wants your thriller album  yeah i dont think the bonfire is such a great idea  i

been down at that banana stand  oh okay good its the only way were ever gonna get it airconditioned  michael how would you like me to owe you a favor  i want you to bid on me at the charity auction this year  okay now id like to use up my favor and decline     and isnt that busters annual job  yes but i cant have a replay of last year   when buster inadvertently bid on lucille 2   10000  buster     and youre embarrassed to have oscar bid on you  with his two pair of pants you bet  oh hi mom i have the afternoon free  really did nothing cancel  all right i need to borrow a fur  i thought you

about guns already on the books   murderers  youre not allowed to sell a gun to a kid   youre not even allowed to fire your gun in the air   is that frank wrench  on the fourth ofjuly   in fact it was peoples choice nominated actor moses taylor  famous for his portrayal of the ruleabiding detective    stop sign  frank wrench  star of the television show wrench  well thats one rule im not gonna follow      aah  thats the second amendment read it  what do you need with one of moms furs   im cold  so am i   no  all right look  i met moses taylor were having a date in the park tomorrow  try to get him to bid on you at the auction tomorrow because michael cant  hes bidding on mother  except that im not now if youll excuse me im gonna go work in the banana stand  and im gonna see if i can get a wrench to strip my nuts  i was trying to be sexy  it just got away from me  its bachelorette season in newport beach and some lovely ladies are up for auction  plus another wolf sighting in the park what that means for your weekend   bad news michael  im afraid the blue man group and i have parted ways  seems im officially no longer a standby understudy   cease and desist  seems they dont appreciate competition   tobias had recently taken out an ad  in a trade magazine for a oneman show  and the worst part is lindsays out there chasing some successful actor  televisions frank wrench  i need to prove to her that im not just a man but a mans man   i think she knows that    jesus its the wolf that is the wolf the wolf is upstairs  i think its just my sons peter and the wolf record  i thought that was a homefill   michael went to check on his fugitive father   who was living in the attic  you heard my call  have you been doing that all over town because people think theres a wolf on the loose  yes there is a wolf on the loose his name is oscar  tell me hes not gonna be bidding on your mother at that charity auction with my money  is that why you called me up here dad  because you are a fugitive and as far as she knows youre in another country  its driving me crazy theyre parading in public  my back isis its in knots i havent had a massage since prison  hope that was forced  but then i found a way to fix my back in this old catalog look at this hot tub  i could use it for so many things it could be my you know water supply  and those uh premade boilinbag meals you just toss those in there   youre not getting a hot tub  come on please  dad please we cant afford that were in this mess because of you  im working at the banana stand just so we dont lose a shift   but  were done pampering ourselves in this family  yeah i would like the biggest airconditioner youve got  no no not tomorrow i need  i need it today im not here tomorrow  just then michael ran into a woman whom he hadnt seen in years   michael  sally sitwell   michael had always been in love with sally sitwell   we could steal a golf cart  no they keep em locked up   i know cause i have a key  ill go get my sweater  oh so you wanna use the key   but his father had a longtime competition with her father  it looks like my boy is gonna be sticking it to your daughter sitwell  stick it to her stick it to her   as a result michael was awkward around her  should we go or stick around  no were not gonna be sticking anything notnot gonna stick a thing   since then hed always been eager to show her that hed become a man   are you still working here  no no no filling in for my son  michael and wow   sally stickwell  right  because the guys wanted to stick it to me   what no  i never   michael used to say that  no i didnt   you said other stuff  i absolutely did not say that   man he loved you  so gob tell me  are you still doing your little tricks  do you consider this to be a little trick  oh did you just squirt me with something  its lighter fluid didnt put in a new flint  but still where did the lighter fluid come from   thats  great  michael maybe ill see you over at the club  we never really took that cart ride did we  and we never will cause im not there   nor am i here i mean im here today  im gonna go   okay  okay  smooth michael  like her fathers head chest arms legs and ass   what are you talkin about  hes hairless michael its a condition  i hate the guy but at least hes got  satiny and smooth probably  im just different than you gob  im not gonna siphon gas out of some girls car like you used to in high school  just so you can show up and say car troubles  its called taking advantage its what gets you ahead in life  like you did with our biggest shareholder lucille austero  that was a onetime thing michael its over   it was far from over   shall i put the posturepedic in the down position  elevate the knees this time  you just let sally sitwell slip away right when she was ready to go   you were scared  what are you talking about     come on  you gonna get off and do your little dance too  no li hurt my ankle yesterday shooting hoops or something   oh god my ankle   dont move let me  no no no its bad   mother mother  buster it hurts   michael decided that perhaps he should go after sally  have you seen my other pair of pants  lupe washed them and they sprouted i threw them out  well that puts a lot of pressure on this pair  i think this ones good looks like it wouldve put up a fight   i put up one to get it  as long as it gets frank wrench to bid on me   it wont   hey mom  i need to borrow your country club card  theres a friend i have that has lunch there often id like to run into  sounds like youre asking for a favor   i know what thats gonna cost me im willing to bid on you  ill give you the money  start at five grand if there are other bidders back off gracefully  shout out i get her 364 days a year for free or something  youre not gonna hear that phrase   soon tobias came across a flyer that promised to improve  both his masculine selfimage and his financial standing  theyre literally blue not sad   meanwhile michael went to have his accidental encounter with sally   but had forgotten about the clubs dress code for lunch  we have a dress code  i cant wear this i look like im 16    michael  oh no   hello michael  stan   hello sally  hi so are you meeting someone here for lunch  no i was going to then they canceled so im gonna take off   no just join us please   michael knew he couldnt say no   but he also knew he couldnt flirt in front ofher father  lets do it   and at another table gob was being taken out to lunch  read me the appetizers again  fried cheese with club sauce     popcorn shrimp with club sauce     chicken fingers  oh stop it youre making me dizzy  with spicy club sauce  no i mean stop it   gob  michael   why dont you join us  oh no   im just helping her eat  oh if youd prefer privacy  what no are you kidding i didnt even wanna have lunch with her in the first place  i just or i ju    and so lunch continued with both bluth boys trying to prove  they werent interested in the women they were interested in  when i saw those golf carts it kind of brought back some memories  did you have too much club sauce on your calamari  gob read me the desserts  she p  probably forgot her old lady glasses  what is the matter with you goby   im happy to read to the lovely lady  an assortment of ice creams and sorbets   you all right with him reading to your girl  not my girl    huh  why dont you read to your girl  come on i dont have a girl no thanks   already taken care of thank you thanks  im sorry  apparently theres been some increased activity on your card   its been declined   in fact the increased activity on michaels card was his fathers  you think a hot tub is the best thing for someone with your condition  i cant see but uh i didnt know there was a doctor installing this  somebody order a case of bag  boil frozen dinners   im happy to get this  no no no please stan ill do it um   can you put this on my mothers card  your mother no no no no shes a pool member only  youll excuse me if my tone is not polite  but this is more polite than she has ever talked to me   michael had a feeling why his credit card had been rejected   what the hell did you do    i overdid it  oh its so hot   michaels father hadjust installed a hot tub in the attic   what happened to you  i tried to drink some of the water  and it was too hot and it tasted like soy sauce  i think the teriyaki chicken burst  thats why people typically dont cook in these things or install them in attics  you gotta get it out of here mikey my eyes theyre burning  wanna thank you for charging it to my credit card  you made me look very foolish in front of sally sitwell   did you stick it to her  no i didnt  you screwed that up just like you screwed up this hot tub  is that veal marsala stuck in the intake  they all look so good on the boxes  you know its good you backed off sally  i dont need that guy saying his daughters sticking it to my loser son  you know something the reason i never went after her is because youre always pushing me  but now that i know that i dont have your approval li think that uh  i think that ill finally go for it  this isnt turning into the party hangout i hoped   hey  hey i thought i heard something before  like a wolf drowning or something  i think that that was maybe the house settling  speaking of settling hows ann i mean have you  have you settled on an artists work to burn   i was thinking eminem for a while  sure  but everyone is gonna be burning eminem so you know  and then i got this pat boone album but the guy is christian  but you know i dont know somebodys gotta burn right   well i guess  right     hey  oh boy i got some looks on the bus cause of this  what are you doing with that thing  i am going to catch that wolf michael im gonna shoot it with this tranquilizer gun  get the reward and bid on my woman at the charity auction  isnt there some kind of a waiting period for a rifle like that   it turns out there is  two weeks isnt there a loophole  there is a gun show loophole  what timing huh i mean right out back they were having one  gob im going hunting for my wife   how lame was lucille 2 at lunch huh     youve gotten attached havent you  youre not gonna tell anybody about this are you  come on im not one to judge  every time ive gone out with sally ive looked like im 12 years old  but yes i probably will tell people about this  maybe we can strike up a deal you keep this to yourself i help you get sally  siphon a little something from her car  you show up in the corvette looking like a man  car troubles  probably shouldnt do the fireball when you siphon the gas  i guess this flints still got a little life left in it huh   lindsay meanwhile was waiting in the park for her date with moses taylor  sorry im late fans      sometimes it takes a while to jar their memories  nice fur you know there are some nuts out there whod wanna throw red paint all over you  wait a minute i think theres one right over there   oh my god youre  someone needs to read this   and thats when lindsays heel went out          i got him   false alarm  crap    im being saved by frank wrench  no youre not   frank wrench  shut up    but unbeknownst to lindsay and tobias   oh shoot   oh great  the actor who played frank wrench wasnt saving her  but was just trying to distance himself  from the outlandish moses taylor hunts peoplescandal  that had been started by a rabid antigun fanatic     and that night michael went to help sally  with the car problems gob had created  what the hell   only to find out things had gotten out ofhand for gob  michael did look heroic as he went to put out the fire  unfortunately sally arrived too late to see him that way     god what happened  car trouble     gob hadjust blown up a car    the next thing i know im running for my life  and all i could think was if something were to ever happen to me  how sad id be you know  what you did to me at lunch today you were ashamed to be with me  no i was ashamed to be seen with you i like being with you  im sorry but you have no courage  how can you say that shh  i thought i heard my mom  how can you say that    and on the other side of the wall   michael  lucille was finalizing her plans for the evening  you can bid up to 10000  the deal is off you didnt tell me it was a restricted membership  find somebody else to do your bidding   there is no one else   hi  hi   they said i could see you finally  yes  god i just feel awful for whoevers car that was  mmhmm i know it   sally i was thinking that maybe you and i could   dont try to talk i have to run anyway i gotta do this charity auction thing  im sorry sir your blue cross blue shield was denied weve called your mother    ill be back ill check on you later feel better   go out sometime    michael decided to bid on her at the auction  and he knewjust where he could get the money to do so  yeah start draining the hot tub its going back   and lucille with no other prospects  turned to the son she least expected to support her  gob i dont suppose i could pay you to bid on me at a charity auction   and gob was just depressed enough to do so   whatever you want  oh goody   and finally george michael and anns   christian music bonfire was under way     without ever going to the gym  i cant believe how many people you told about this  yeah i hope i didnt confuse people by saying it was a cd burning party  great party   maeby i burned like 10 cds from somebodys mp3 player  this is a disaster  maybe you shouldjust try listening to some of the music  yeah some of the artists are kind of talented  i dont know if youve heard ofthe jerky boys they do prank phone calls  its kind of old school but i have the tape in my room  i accidentally didnt burn it yet    meanwhile the auction began  next up  weve got last years charity case lindsay fnke    lindsay showed up  oh no not again   although she was still feeling the effects of the tranquilizer   hundred dollars folks  stick a wrench in me im done   anybody got 50  my wife is humiliated  this is my chance to right the small wrong that i did  you shot her in the ass with about four ounces of horse tranquilizer   i havent been the perfect husband yes i admit that   twenty     but now is my chance to be a hero   please michael give me some of your money   ten   does anybody have 10  ive got 5000 and i need that for sally   but if you wanna make a low bid  five thousand dollars   for that sold    i think you overpaid   george michaels prospects were also improving   as the two made prank phone calls together  let me try   hey rubberneck   ann  could you and george michael please call someone else for a little while   he knows it was us  what  we finally got a good one cominup  sally sitwell what do i hear    five hundred dollars  youre not bidding i was hoping you would    six hundred  you were  youre a good kid you always have been  not like that showboat of a father of yours if you dont mind me saying    seven hundred  ive called him so much worse  the truth is sir i am interested  but i dont have the money to buy your daughter    you sure do drive a nice car   eight hundred  and i need one mine got torched today    one thousand  drop it off when you drop my daughter off tonight   and finally with both the approval of sallys father  and the lack of approval ofhis own michael was ready to make his move    15000   what   wow  yeah  i gotta tell ya this puts a lot of pressure on me   its for a good cause  i heard it was to reseed the greens  gonna be a lot of shifts for you at the banana stand huh  i should be honest with you i dont have that much money   and i sold the corvette to cover it  thats quick to who   your father as a matter of fact  my father   yeah  my father cant drive a convertible  mind if i open it up  wow   got some pickup   this is just like him  he always interferes with everyone i date  well you can tell him to give you your car back   but i bought you  im sorry im not like you  id almost rather date someone my father doesnt approve of  thanks anyway   thatthatthat is like me thats exactly like me   and soon it was time for gob to bid on his mother  not all bad the only one bidding on lucille 2 is that hairless sitwell   seven right there eight    sitwells bidding on lucille 2  nine  first he fires me then he steals my    going once   mothers best friend  going twice nine going twice   10000  oh how grand  sold up from 800 to  10000  wow you guys really want a new golf course  and all from nonmembers   on the next arrested development   george sr shows up to bid on lucille     but the sound ofhis wolf call  and the smell of chicken teriyaki interfere  no no no no  no oh  oh oh no
