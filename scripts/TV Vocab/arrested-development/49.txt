                the bluths were desperate  i assume youve all seen this  the press had them all but finished  what what is it  this isnt really going to work over the phone dad  then get bob loblaw to hire to hire me another surrogate  thats kind of the point  mr loblaw no longer works for us because someone wanted a boyfriend  dont blame me  i was talking to lindsay actually  but he was clearly turned off to the both of you  but now were going to need a new lawyer  and that is going to mean about a 100000 retainer  if we want a chance of keeping this family going past the next few weeks  were going to have to pull out all the stops  what am i talking about  im talking about all of you getting jobs  now the best place to look for a job  who threw the tomato  well how the hell are we going to get 100 grand  well i know this isnt exactly what youre looking for  but maeby was just accepted into private school  and ive sent the check in already  no thats not what im looking for at all  michael its the most prestigious private school in town  oh no not the milford academy  children were neither were to be seen nor heard at the school buster had attended  its the exact opposite its called openings  oh great that sounds like another one  of those gradeless structureless new age feelgooderies  they teach selfexpression and getting in touch with feelings michael  i mean i know you dont have any  the boy who couldnt cry  hes a robot  michael can cry he doesnt want to rust  yes hes like the steel man from the wizard from oz  tin man  is that what hes called  he knows  you know lindsay since you already sent the check  this is how youre going to pay for it  youre gonna be in charge of the house from now on okay  the cooking the cleaning all of it  youre going to put lindsay in charge of the cooking  at least youll lose weight  you know mom i think the only time you ever cooked for us  was the morning rosas mom died  you gave us cereal in an ashtray  gob pal how about you can you find some work  oh sure michael  as what a waiter  can i get you something madam  i will have a vodka though  what oh  you know if youd ever accidentally worked a day in your life  youd know that theres no indignity in it  great shell have a vodka  instead of us all selling out and becoming housewives and waiters  why dont we have a big event  some sort of save our bluths type thing  well throw a legal defense fund dinner ask for donations  as long as we dont look desperate  we want them to think well take their help but we dont need it  i should be seen a lot at the club  yeah our backs are against the wall its just  hard to accept that its really come to begging  some times its the only way to stay in the game  please tell your friends about this show  michael had asked lindsay to take care of the house  and to his surprise   youre sort of doing it  she was sort of doing it  yeah check it out  i found that canned ham that wed had forever  and i put it in a pot of boiling water and guess what im calling it  soup  hot ham water  you know im actually a really good mom  i think its cause maebys never around  you should send george michael to openings too  yes it could help him express his feelings  my son expresses himself just fine  isnt that right son  what yeah fine  uh yes i dont care  whats up  yes hes a regular freddy wilson that one  i dont know that reference  i dont either  i dont know either  its this guy  my sons just fine where he is and hes got the sats coming up  you got to do well on those you studying upstairs  yeah im just taking a three real quick so i can get a cream soda  oh ill get that for you  no i will get it i have to get it myself  just relax  just check the stove  you know michael if i may take off my acting pants for a moment  and pull my analrapist stocking over my head  george michael has been acting strange lately  i think he may have developed what we in the soft sciences  refer to obsessivecompulsive disorder  or the oc disorder  dont call it that  i  think ultimately its because hes afraid to express himself  actually it was because he was afraid  his aunt lindsay was going to burn the house down  hi how are you  cream soda  maybe he does need this school  did you see this letter  you know its done wonders for maeby  maeby is an exceptional young lady  exceptional  we are sure that she is destined for great things  great things  and we wish her luck in all her  it says over  probably have to crack this open to be sure  but this sounds like an expulsion letter  shes never been to class  what kind of boarding school would lose track of its students  openings is not a boarding school  i thought it was a boarding school too  actually maeby had been on the set of a film called snowboarding school 2  in her secret life as a film executive  there goes that nonrefundable tuition  you know it is the one rule that they do have there  she should be punished for this  you know tobias if i can become a more traditional mother  than maybe you could start being more of a  nontraditional mother yes youre right  after all i am her father  burners are still off and i rewashed all the clothes  and thats when michael decided that perhaps maebys tuition  didnt have to go to waste after all  meanwhile lucille went to work soliciting for the bluth fundraiser  i mean we have plenty of money dont get me wrong  but we cant use our personal assets to defend the company  just then gob arrived and decided to have a laugh  your drink madam   can i get you anything  get that one out of here  as you please  but lucille had never made eye contact with a waiter  can you drop these off at two  why not  im just a waiter  so he kept it up  were all out of the halibut  the joke was over  but the lunch rush was just beginning  hey new guy you want to seat table four  back at the penthouse however   my lunch is long overdue  lunch was long overdue  i dont suppose she left anything for me to eat  no just the soup and a half sandwich and a whole sandwich for me  hey so whats going on with the fundraiser  well i dont think the home builders organization is going to be supporting us  yeah the hbos not going to want us what do we do now  well i think its show time  i think we have to have a show during dinner  hey we can have some celebrities in  you know oscar winners like nicole kidman  i dont want to just round up a bunch of famous people that have nothing to do  with our family as some sort of cheap stunt whats that got to do with us  nothing but youre going to write a speech about me  so they can see how wonderful i am  i think weve got a better chance at nicole kidman  actually i may have an in with andy richter  do you think you can get him  im kidding of course not him  his brother does teach george michael at openings  george michael is going to that new age feelgoodery  i dont think thats a good idea  theyre going to poison him against you  remember what happened when we sent lindsay to that kind of school  all of a sudden i was the bad guy to her  and you dont respect mom and you dont respect women  are you married  damn  school  i said to the teacher i said you poison her ill poison you  george sr did more than just say it  he sent the man a basket of poisoned muffins  do you know the muffin man  theres a reward in it if you do  then would you like some foam in your coffee  its called a cuppakeno and wait till you see what it costs  you can say what you want about the milford academy  the kids that came out of there prepared for life  does anyone know how to eat one of these  you know george michaels going to be just fine okay  i just want him to know how to express himself  it doesnt do anything  he was actually having trouble expressing himself  why dont you tell the group about yourself  my name is george michael bluth  im a 16yearold caucasian male  my mom died  and i guess thats it  hardly  see if it were me i would say im donny richter  i have a brother named andy hes an attention hog  he cant seem to really attract a real audience  but i love the fat sob anyway  i thought you looked like that guy andy richter  you guys are identical twins  identical quintuplets actually  there was andy the showoff donny the sensitive one  jerrifth the flirt rocky the risktaker and andys stunt double  and emmet who asked that we not show his picture  although composite photography tells us hed looks something like this  heres what i want you to do  i want you to go home tonight and write something about how you really feel  something critical  bring it in tomorrow and read it for the group  will this go toward my grade  we dont have grades here  a student either learns and gets an l  or they fluctuate in their learning  what  do we get for that  an f  mr f  maeby meanwhile was about to have a learning experience of her own  well well i understand youve been having trouble with that expensive boarding school  thats right i can read  okay first of all variety got it wrong all right we didnt even want this project  it was a cofinance with miramax then poof miramax is gone  and were still on the hook and it turns out jamie kennedy cant even snowboard  all right ill listen to this later  and dont tell me where youve been itll just make me worry more  but guess what  theres a new daddy in town  a discipline daddy  oh its a its a parenting tape  if you want to skip school thats fine  youll just come to work with me  but you dont have a job  all right here tell you what were going to do  we are going to stuff each one of these gift bags with  a head shot some glitter and a decorative hand soap  and were going to send them to every casting director in town  and dont forget the funny notes  i know where you live haha  casting directors hate this  they really do  the glitter queen struck again  never hire tobias funke  and back at the country club something unusual had happened  oh i dont have any drugs for sale  unless did you expect me to follow you to your car  theyre your tips  tips  and gob realized hed accidentally worked a day in his life  lindsay meanwhile was being a mother  when someone showed up who needed one  howd you get here  i walked i tried hitchhiking but its hard to do without a thumb  im so hungry  would you like to try some of this  its so watery  and yet theres a smack of ham to it  its hot ham water  upstairs george michael was struggling with his assignment  can you think of anything critical to say about my dad  are you serious  i have glitter in my lungs from making goody bags for casting directors  and hes giving me 100 more to do for homework  its like i dont do my homework george michael does my homework  and thats when he decided it was time to cheat off of her  you know it might help if you expressed yourself  it also gave him an opportunity to smell her neck  and the next day michael drove to openings  in the hopes of recruiting donnys brother for the fundraiser  when he noticed his son expressing himself rather well  he pretends hes the great father all of a sudden and acts like hes all worried about me  but it turns out he just does it so i can help him with his joke of a career  no wonder mom wanted out so bad   oh my god  oh my god  gob meanwhile was several days into being an accidental waiter  and he discovered that a little flirting helped bring in the tips  if you didnt have adult onset diabetes i wouldnt mind giving you a little suger  oh gob you could charm the black off a telegram boy  okay well just tell you now shes the one who dies  his name is andy something  i think hes ed mcmahons kid a song and dance man  lucille meanwhile was there soliciting for the fundraiser  but still hadnt noticed him  well have the lobster tail  until this happened  and maybe later you can save a little piece of tail for me  come on  i hope that isnt the sort of humor andy mcmahon will be doing  lobster  maam  and michael went to confront donny  hey nice haircut and thanks for turning my son against me  oh oh no no im andy  oh  sorry  oh hey  howd you feel about coming to a fundraiser at our house  how much does it pay   its just a free dinner  ill be there  great  ill be in the cafeteria  ugh hes such a pig  you should know about bad mouthing family members  i  heard what you had my son say out there  he chose what to say  maybe we should include him in this  no need youre the one that poisoned him against me  how would you like that done to you  are you threatening to poison me  im just expressing myself man  what did i tell you  how dare that donny richter  you know you got to take care of that guy or i will  yeah yeah let me  this is not your business no  im just going to pull him out of that school  youre damn right you are we cant have this happen not now  this family has got to stick together  i dont want gob coming to this dinner  good idea  guess where hes been getting his money  is he following people to their cars again  hes a waiter  he is well thats great  no its not great  well am i the only one that thinks that this family  is finally starting to become sympathetic and relatable  i mean thats what people want to see  lindsays taking care of the house  oh i forgot about that  tell the housewife shes not coming either  if you dont want her you dont want me either  shes taking care of me  she glued my thumb back on  sisters my new mother mother  and is it just me or is she looking hotter too   well why dont you marry her  maybe i will  were veering away from relatability again  meanwhile maeby was getting tired of being with her father  now what we do is we paint our lips joan crawford red  pop on a little blue eyeliner and then plant a lipstick kiss on every one of them  why the blue eyeliner  well she felt that her eyes were too close together  hello  uh y uh  its a casting director  yes he is available  uh let me put my uh our assistant on the phone with you thank you yes  i better get changed  thanks deb  yeah so hes tortured victim 4 right  no thats great  yeah hes really into discipline  and george michael was about  to get some discipline too  you are no longer going to that school  i dont want to get into a big discussion about it  but its just not right for you  is this because i cheated off maeby  because ive never done that before dad i swear  i just couldnt think of anything to write about you  so i asked her to write it about her dad  you cheated  yeah it was stupid of me now donnys met you  i mean hes never going to believe that you were ever up for a part in wicked  yeah well you know you do what you have to do  you think i want to give that speech about dad at the fundraiser  sometimes you say you hate your dad to get a good grade  or you like him to make some money  sounds like youre doing a great job over there   were keeping you in  no i wasnt  said i dont want to have a whole discussion about it  donny oh  i guess i owe you an apology  its andy again isnt it  rocky  andys the pig  well youre not exactly  im his stunt double you think i like this  i disgust myself  let go of my dad youre going to hurt him  oh no im only making it look like that  hes totally in charge of the situation  so what is the problem  somebody sent my brother donny a basket of poison muffins  it couldve been the muffin man they never caught him  how do you know about that  i saw it on why we were scared of the 70s  and whatever happened to the muffin man remember him  i always pictured a giant sixfoot muffin  trying to eat me while i was eating him  its kind of a fantasy i go to a lot now  and he says you threatened to poison him  i was upset id just heard that my son thought i was a horrible father  but no i didnt poison him  well if i find out you did  oh andy wants to know at this dinner you want him to sing or anything  a song would be fantastic  so dad you saw that i thought you didnt know what i said about you  well that wasnt exactly the truth  but dont worry i know you dont have anything bad to say about me  well no you know what i think donny was right  i just wasnt digging deep enough  i think i mightve meant what i said you never listen to me  you didnt ask me if i wanted to go to the school you didnt ask me about what i said  you threatened my teacher you dont respect me  how can i respect you man  it was a complex situation without an easy solution  hello  the caterers didnt show up i used the club  they said we owe them too much money  i guess all those lunches  ive got 50 people coming in three hours and nothing to feed them  no one to serve it  we have to make a good impression or were finished  now thats a clear cut situation with a promise of comedy  tell your friends  the save our bluths party was starting to heat up  but the same could not be said for lindsays chicken  what is going on theyre getting restless  i cant offer to  bleep  him in front of their husbands  this is what youre making  poached salmonella  itll be fine  ill just put the sauce on them  what kind of sauce is that  wait this is the water i thawed the chicken in  oh well that should go with chicken  yeah  fantastic  and some powerful players showed up  george bill kinkaid from phosco industries  sort of  hope you dont mind i sent one of those stupid surrogates  you got busted too  no i had a prior engagement  im at the fire  ice ball  coming through chicken in chicken sauce  thank you very much for showing up  maybe you could just sing while theyre bringing out the dinners  uh im not andy  im emmitt  andy sent me over to let you know that hes not going to be able to make it tonight  michael was suspicious  i mean think about it  we cant show emmitt without blurring him  yeah hes singing at the fire  ice ball tonight  andy richter is singing at the fire  ice ball  i should send andy a little basket of poison muffins too  muffins  oh my god dad  youre the muffin man  you poisoned 25 teachers during the 70s  just the first two the others were copycats  you poisoned donny didnt you  were losing them come on come on  have your attention my son would like to say just a couple of words about me  and thats when michael noticed his own son  you came huh  yeah well it was wrong of me to say what i did about how i felt  no you said what you felt  and maybe its about time i did the same thing  so why dont we just let him express himself go ahead son  um i was going to say that you dont know who my father really is  and that what has happened to us is a great injustice  that we were never really given a fair chance  but thats not the truth  weve been given plenty of chances  and maybe the bluths just arent worth saving maybe were not that likable you know  were very selfcentered  and my father may be the worst of us  me too you know i seem to i threaten people who i dont feel support me  he poisons them  anyway heres my advice to you  go ahead and take yourself a goody bag and get out of here while you can  the speech was disturbing the food inedible  and the gift bags pretty frightening  and when gob realized he wouldnt get tipped  wait no no wheres everyone going  the service got a little worse  no ones leaving until i get my money  ill follow you to your cars  oh and then that old racist woman choked on busters thumb  my thumb  all in all it was one of the bluths better dinner parties  hey whatd you think of the speech  youd do great at openings  you know pal you do not have to go there  ive just been very worried about your behavior  you know youre always turning off burners and irons and  it may be ocd  ocd no im just cleaning up after aunt lindsay she never turns things off  well  guess that explains why i saw the hedge trimmer zipping around the drive way  i did it again didnt i im so selfcentered  from now on i want you to just tell me whats on your mind okay  and i promise i wont just hear what i want to hear okay   i love my cousin  love you too pal  on the next arreted development  the bluth family gets some good news  theyre all sending in donations  and you know what key was  your speech  it didnt sound desperate  well i guess it really doesnt pay to be desperate  it sure doesnt  and cut  lets not celebrate yet we still got the west coast feed guys
