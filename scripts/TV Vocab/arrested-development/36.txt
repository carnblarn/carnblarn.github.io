                now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything  and the one son who had no choice  but to keep them all together  its arrested development   michael was surprised to find the house  still a mess a week after the fumigation  you still havent put this stuff back yet youve got to be the laziest person in the world  if you werent all the way on the other side of the room id slap your face   i asked you to clean this up  yeah and you also asked me to call the fumigators  and you havent even thanked me for doing that   michael had asked her to do this but that was long before  he began hiding his fugitive father in the attic  what uh oh god  polly cover your mouth   luckily michael was notified in time  well we had a deal you know id pay for everything and youd clean the house   and youve only done it once   she hadnt even done it that time     but instead intercepted her mothers housekeeper   as she was arriving for work  can i take you the rest of the way   mrs mrs   oh i have to make one quick stop first  almost done yours or misters   misters   lupe never accepted a ride from lindsay again  well im sorry michael but tobias moving out hasnt been easy  for any of us  you didnt even notice hed gone did you  i did notice wed stopped tivoing the christopher lowell show   what happened   i tried to give it one last chance   like what you see   ive been looking for those   youre gonna stretch them out  thats all you can say  well excuse me for liking the way they shape my junk  i dont know why but thats it  you can pack your junk and get out  youre kicking me out at the beginning of pilot season  youre not gonna make it as an actor and were not gonna make it as a couple   with nowhere to go tobias went to the studio  where hed occasionally worked as a security guard and took up residence  in the apartment of detective frank wrench on the set of the television show  wrench  im really sorry to hear that hows maeby taking it   well shes really hard to read  you havent told her yet  well she was so excited the hot water in the shower was lasting longer  how could i have the heart to tell her its because her father moved out  tobias moved out   did he take the good video camera with him   thats touching   what do you need the camera for  im making a magic video  im gonna tape myself doing tricks around the office  im calling it tricks  let me finish around the office  i figured out a way to make money while im working  that is what we call working something you might wanna try next time youre at the office  youve been missing things lately im gettinreal tired of it  incidentally today were having a big vote on that building renovation   i need you there to help me vote it in  fine ill vote  as long as you give me the camera  i think we all know that george michael was using it last   a fact the family had discovered when theyd gathered to watch a home video  was that a 40th anniversary party huh didnt cost us a thing  is that qusay hussein at the omelet bar  look at this if these guys move they dont get paid   it seems that as a 13yearold george michael had been  heavily influenced by the star wars films  and had endeavored to recreate his favorite moments   youre not my father youll never be  i spent 21 million  of good company money and end up with this   you cut off my hand   worth every penny  even you have to admit that that was the lamest thing ever put on tape   not so buster had once videotaped himself  recreating moments from his then favorite film chicago      he also liked star wars  his selfesteem is low enough as it is and i have no idea why  i mean hes such a great kid and everybody loves him hes george michael  truthfully thats why im not that crazy about that ann but hell move on  unless he knocks her up like you did with his mother plus shes religious  if that one gets pregnant it stays pregnant  believe me i dated a chick like that once in high school  no i didnt  i gotta work on that boys selfesteem   michael went to do so only to hear ann beating him to it    i want you to do it  i dont think im ready    of course you are  im gonna lose it before i start  dont start  smoking its a killer that sammy davis jr should still be performing   whats going on  ann thinks i should run for student body president   thats a great idea  well i dont have a chance   they only vote for the cool kids  but everyone loves you  you are george michael whos cooler than you    plus you would be following in your old mans footsteps   you were student body president  ohho   it was close  so you lost   who remembers  i know i would remember  ann if my dad says that he won then he won  didnt say i won said i cant remember  but now that were thinking about it i seem to remember the other guy won the title  although there were plenty in the school who wanted to overturn the decision  i said lets do not lets not put the school through that  havent thought about that for years good memory  well anyway ill help you run your campaign and make your commercial for election day  well thats great the important thing is  to raise the old selfesteem and not to rush a physical relationship   those are really the two important things  no were both waiting   good  and then that first time after waiting and waiting  its gonna be so awesome because its not just gonna be my love and george michaels  but gods love as well   god its gonna be incredible  all right ill do it im in   campaign  im pumped   as george michael was on the path to higher selfesteem  buster was losing what little he had  i cant put the aorta in with this thing  oh stop complaining   buster  im sorry im an inconvenience to you mother  oh god oh god oh      as lupe felt sorry  for busters loss of a hand lindsay felt sorry for her loss of lupe  lindsay had cleaned one room and now had a garbage problem   and while looking for a spot to stash the refuse    she came upon an old friend  i havent seen this in ages ebay   unfortunately it was a new friend to george sr   polly   back at the office michael came to regret having given gob the video camera  well i certainly appreciate your decision  but if my brother was here we couldve voted this thing through  whats this a stuffy office meeting  well maybe its time for a little office magic   whats office magic  sometimes its as simple as turning 1045  in the morning into lunchtime    okay  why does lunch have to be so dull  maybe youd prefer some chicken instead  all right lets cut take five everybody   no no were not takin five hey is this guy with you  yeah hes an actor  well you know i thought he was an investor he voted against me  which is the vote i asked you to be here for so  you know what i dont know why but thats it i dont think i can work with you anymore   you kind of have to guy im the president  no im the president  no you lost the presidency just like you did in high school when you refused to play dirty   worked when i ran  were talkin about the office here okay  i do all the work ive been helping you thats over now  sorry to hear you say that michael cause it just cost you your job   im serious its over  how do you call security on this thing   you hit poundzerozero to operate the system  pound is tictactoe right   yeah pound is right  when i keep hitting that the other thing flashes   hit pound and then zerozero  i do i know  tell you what you dont need to learn the system because youre out of here  youre fired  have security send a man up  youve got the wrong guy  uh no you dont but you

all about  your uncle doesnt notwork here anymore   so i guess your mom told you about your dad moving out huh  no she did not tell me that   oh  but she doesnt tell me anything   neither of them do

using your copier to make some campaign posters  well then by all means let me help you out  i mean i dont even know why im doing it hes gonna win by a landslide   thats what i was tellin him  how do you know steve holt   are you in aa  i was talkin about george michael  hes running for student body president whos steve holt  hes just the hottest guy in school and hes won three years in a row  every year after his first junior year  so then hes more popular than george michael  well thats like comparing apples and some fruit nobodys ever heard of  he might even finish after the indian kid  i guess i gotta get down to the school and see if i can stop him from signing up huh  yes you have to and do you think you could put up a couple of these when youre there  cause i was really not in the mood to go down there   michael went to take care ofhis son  as lucille discovered that hers was already being taken care of    mother  and yet youre too good to polish the candlesticks   youre fired  you cant fire me im your son   im firing you  i was firing lupe  well that makes more sense   lindsay came upon lupe whodjust been fired  i no clean for family anymore  cant you at least come over and dustbuster or something   i no does buster anymore  fine  ill dustbuster god    hello  hey i cant talk loudly  im in the bathroom of the wrench set and theyve started shooting   also i dont

looking for a cleaning lady so if you hear of one   shh shh   dirty cop so frank wrench is gonna clean ya   why is this door locked   cut    is somebody using the set bathroom  i gotta go   michael arrived at school to talk his son out of running for office  it took me all day but i got the 10 signatures im running for student body president   listen george michael  were gonna use your idea and highlight being chaste  i just meant you two shouldnt youre not gonna put up this poster are you  its really gonna appeal to the christian crowd  i couldnt have done this without you guys im gonna win this thing   four more years four more years  four more years four more years   and gob showed up at his mothers   well guess whos been fired  michael fired you  no i fired him as a result im no longer welcome in the office  what a coincidence i just fired my housekeeper  but ive already found a replacement     its a robot   i hate it i miss lupe  no i wont let you go down that road  i want you to be strong and you dont need the comfort of an immigrant  in mothers old stirrup pants to make you feel that way   oh     ohh youre hungry      lindsay was about to find a replacement for lupe as well  who is it   the new housekeeper the agency sent me over  im sorry i didnt call any  oh allow me to introduce myself my name is phyllidia featherbottom  and i can cook and i can clean and i can take care of the little ones  i can also sing a song or two if it comes in handy  when you put a squirt of frosting on your throat  before we take our medications   tobias had gained access to the studios wardrobe and makeup department  he was eager to both see his daughter  and prove to his wife that he had what it took to be an actor   it was the exact plot of the film mrs doubtfire  in the most delicious way    there was also some mary poppins in there  lets get this house cleaned  hey lindsay the place looks fantastic   what did you pay somebody to do this  oh ive no need for payment  the love of the family is more than enough  im sorry this is mrs featherbottom  from blackstone im charmed im sure   ooh  back to work   i think he misses his daughter  thats convenient  considering you didnt even have the courage to tell maeby that hed moved out  im sorry im not the perfect parent like you  im not that perfect i pushed george michael into running for office  and i think hes gonna get crushed by this kid steve holt  yeah id vote for steve too bad dads on the lam  you could finally use some of his dirty tricks to get george michael elected      as it happens george sr had come to  in the attic and perhaps it was the effect oflosing his one friend    polly  or the lingering effects of the fumigation   or perhaps it really was divine intervention    but hed had a profound realization    unfortunately the timing of the enlightenment wasnt ideal for michael   thats why i need your help  our heavenly father let his son die  so that our sins could be absolved   great so youre a christian now  we must all seek forgiveness  well ill call the warden for you you can ask him yourself  well i think thats for fresh crimes besides youve always tried to lead a clean life  you and gob were like those biblical brothers gallant and um  goofuth   michael realized he had lived like gallant  and ifhe wanted to help his sons election  he would have to find goofuth   been lookin all over for you pal  if you came to grovel  for the job of president youre too late   my brother already fired me  listen im really sorry that i got upset with you  you know and i never meant to um i didnt even mean to fire you  you know and i never meant to um i didnt even mean to fire you  you know i just got so frustrated and gob you are my brother   of course im gonna support you  well  now i feel bad for firing you  listen george michael is running for student body president  and i have a feeling hes gonna get slaughtered  the guy hes running against is basically a young you  wow it wont be easy to win a race against myself   of course if anyone can do it i can  thats right   i wish i was 15 years younger  he doesnt need to beat him   he just needs to beat the indian kid  if i do this youll rehire me   of course i will  the mere fact that you think you can  says to me that i shouldnt let you  course we both need the work  robotll get it  where the hell is my maid robot    but the robot was busy elsewhere            what do you expect mother im half machine  im a monster     michael brought gob in to consult on his sons campaign  focus on the video and shy away from the virgin thing  oh we should definitely sacrifice the whole virgin thing  and i got the perfect way  we hand out rubbers that say we salute george michael   were not supposed to have help  i dont wanna make steve look bad  yeah i just dont want my son to be embarrassed up there lets not play too dirty   uh good point two percent  two percent huh is that how little i lost by   lost by thats all you got  not really important  well if your son wants more than two percent hes gonna have to go after steve holt  so i want you to tell me every awful rumor youve ever heard about this kid  i cant support this and neither can the christian kids   that were gonna make you president  uh   ann i think shes really upset about this  shell forgive ya youre george michael      meanwhile  maeby was meeting her new singing nanny  now take your funfun  this is my moms and its fenphen and its been banned by the fda  oh well you should always read the label  you should always read it well in the most delicious way   mr fingerbottom  mrs  right mrs i should really get going  no no no no no sit back whats the rush please  i wanna hear about you tell me about your family  im sure wherever your father is right now she loves you very very much  not enough to be honest with me   and after a few days gob was ready  to unveil george michaels new message   drought starvation   these are the things my family has had to deal with for generations  although fortunately not since we moved to corona del mar      go home you terrorist  how stupid do you have to be to say something like that   youre not wanted here  gob   michael  you got george michaels tape  yeah i gave it to the tech guy dont worry its very tastefully done     sure you didnt make that video in a cave    perennial candidate steve holt   soon it was time  for steve holt to play his video  which had been produced by his new campaign manager ann veal   hi im steve holt   evil     this kids popular  looks like a chick i did once in high school  get a haircut  recently ive been dealing with the fact that ive never known my father  but i finally found a new father  youre probably wondering what these footsteps are  well this is my second take its kind of like a second chance at making good    yeah okay we need to pull the videotape   my tape  why  ive made a huge mistake    but it was too late to do anything about it     steve holt is a bastard he doesnt even know who his real father is  what else dont we know about steve holt  george michael bluth is a cool guy  his dad is a powerful executive working for this man  the girls like him just fine young and old it doesnt matter   in the dark  thats why you had me do that      george michael had never been more embarrassed     until this part     i couldnt find another tape    i like steves more  guess i underestimated the religious vote   so steve won  no steve dropped out of the race  he says he wants to spend some time trying to find his real father  rav nadir the indian kid he got 97 of the vote  well that leaves three percent you did better than i did when i ran  i tied with bart simpson and school sucks  im really sorry buddy believe it or not i did this  because i didnt want you to feel bad about yourself  hey its star dork  hey he knows you now im really sorry buddy  its just a drag i mean im pretty sure my girlfriends gone forever  and i never wanted to do this in the first place  george michael was that really you doing those lightsaber moves   you were incredible  ive only gotten better  youre still doin that  so you wanna grab a curtain rod and go over to my place  wow id love that thanks ann  you really make me feel good about myself  gotta do something about that kids selfesteem   on the next arrested development  yoohoo ill take you the rest of the way   lucille finds a housekeeper that she wont lose her son to  always keep from crying even though your heart is dying     and steve holt finally tracks down his real father  ive been wonderin my whole life who he is  a scientist a doctor a senator  well we got some bad news  wow is that whats gonna happen to my hair
