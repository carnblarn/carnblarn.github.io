the first place  and hes right hes right  ive gotta get rid of her  you know l i said two weeks ago  that i thought it was a stupid idea  suddenly dad says it and its good advice  you know you dont

try to break us up   i cant do that  why not  you did it with me and marta  you had no problem with that  guy you know what lie to her  tell her that im insensitive and unreliable  something about how you can never confront  people you need someone  to clean up your messes  see thats great and thats  just off the top of your head  michael gob i was just in the neighborhood  good lord it is sweltering in here  as you may or may not know  lindsay and i have hit a bit of a rough patch  really when did that start   well  i dont want to blame it all on 911  but it certainly didnt help  but anyway i need your  help if you could possibly  could we go back to your office please  i just want to be a family again  i guess what im saying is  i want to reunite the band  oh no     oh nowas right  in the mid 90s tobias formed a folk  music group with lindsay and maeby  called dr fnkes 100 natural  goodtime familyband solution  the group was underwritten by  the natural life food company  a division of chem grow an allyncrane  acquisition and part of the squimm group  their motto was simple we keep you alive    singing jingle  zanotab may cause dry mouth hair loss  an overly alert feeling and in  some cases may diminish your sex drive  well theres a wellness convention in town  and i thought maybe you could talk  lindsay into joining me up onstage  yeah why dont  you ask her   oh  would but she just doesnt take me seriously   michael tried to find the  money the accountant said was missing  i dont know i probably stole it  i mean if he says its missing it is  unless he stole it hey maybe he stole it   hes the one that said its  missing  yeah  i probably stole it  well we need to find it  before ira is asked to testify   i thought we were talking about  gilligan whos  ira  ira gilligan  iras his first name he  actually hates to be called gilligan  well he never told me that  gilligan has promised me that all  this money will be saved in iras   its ira sir  oh im sorry gilligan  will be saved in iras   what the hell is this  gilligan  its ira sir   please call me  gilligan  michael if he testifies i am screwed  heres what you do you take him  out for some fishing or something  why would i take him  fishing   fun guy fun   lets get him  on our side  no  look im not taking him fishing  oh thats right you hated fishing   no i didnt  no ill  get gob yeah he liked it   hang on a second  hes the one whos fun  i liked fishing where are you going im fun  its just that listen  the way to fix this ira thing  is not to buy him off all right   its to find out where the  money went  youre no fun  yeah im plenty fun   that night the  family gathered at lucilles  to welcome gobs wife  i have always wanted a daughter  gasps  and a blonde what fun  where did annyong get  thatjuice box   annyong  those are for his soccer team no  sugar for you you just get more awful  hey adopted brother  do you think i could have a  hit of that juice box that   sucking air   michael tried to  convince lindsay to rejoin  dr fnkes 100 natural  goodtime familyband solution  dr fnkes 100 natural goodtime  familyband solution was a nightmare for me  hmm well he said it was the  most fun your familys ever had  yeah well i was wacked  on zanotab the entire time  i thought zanotab was supposed to  make everything a little bit better  for 15 minutes then it burns when  you pee and your marriage goes to hell  it is not a good supplement  besides maebys not gonna want to do it  i wanna do it are you kidding me  those were our best times ever  this party just keeps gettin better  so uh you know if you want me on  wood block i can keep perfect time  some call me the human metronome  you notice how im always on  time im never late for things  yeah but i think punctuality is  slightly different from rhythm  no its not its the exact same  thing its knowing how long things take  look im just doing this because if my  parents split up its a lot more work for me  i know they split up once in boston  when they get along i get tons more alone time  when they dont guess who they  start spending all their time with   me  weve  been talking here  for 28 seconds just so you know  excuse me dr funky   ah fnke   of dr fnkes 100  natural goodtime familyband solution   yes  oh my i saw you in 96   oh  you sang a song about  a supplement called teamocil   teamocil  i mean you just nailed me  it was like you knew every side  effect i was going through at that time    singing jingle  sadly teamocil has  been discontinued   oh  the sense of wellness it  created in relationships  was merely the first sign of  complete pituitary shutdown  excuse me are you uh hi im michael   hi   im gobs brother   yes he told me all about you   you have a terrific voice  i smell olives   and michael  as per gobs request  tried to convince his  wife that gob was unreliable  so gob is late but i  guess thats who you married  hes probably out trying to  do something very important  are you hitting on me gob said that would happen    hey gob its a good thing youre  not staying married to this girl  youve got her hating me at least  your version of me which is actually you  well i talked to dad and he  thinks that i should stay in it  stay in the marriage youre not letting dad  lead you around by the nose again are you  think about it ive got the  marriage and none of the good parts  its like so far its been all chain and no ball   sure  so well have a  ceremony and a bachelor party  a bachelor party you want one now come on   youre not giving your best man a  whole lot of prep  time  dad can handle it   dad  yeah you know  hes a fun guy and  im making him  my best man   your  making dad your best man thats great  i guess being your brother  and solving all your problems for you  doesnt qualify me as your best man  hey if he wants to support me  im not gonna tell him to go to hell  dont worry youre still   what invited  no i was gonna say youre still the guy  i want solving my problems but yeah  let me talk to dad about that invite situation   the next day  gob visited his father  to prepare for his bachelor party  you know i really think that  youre gonna like this woman  well shes costing me enough but  shes oh shes a hell of a stripper   no i mean my wife  oh  well l i doubt that very much  well i can tell you that michael was  pretty upset that you wanted to be best man   dont worry about  michael  yeah my  bachelor partys about having fun right  no no your bachelor partys about  convincing gilligan that  hes killed a stripper  getting him out of town so he cant testify  and making sure that people  think that he took the money   it is  yeah  this accountant can do us a lot of  damage i want him neutralized do you hear me  thats why i want you to use this  stripper a  narcoleptic believe it or not  a friend of mine at the yacht club  he used her for his bachelor party  we wanted you to have the first piece    snoring    you put her in a darkened space shes out  you get him drunk he passes out  then you cover the floor with corn  syrup mixed with a little red dye  he comes to eee blood aaah he freaks out  okay but how do you know that  hes gonna leave the country  thats why i got you those honeymoon  tickets you never thanked me for those   stammering im sorry  i meant to i was gonna  you just have to  convince him that this happened   that he killed a stripper  can you do this  can i trust you youre not  gonna go all michael on me are ya  nobodys turning all michael on you  but when you get out then were  gonna have a real party right dad  are you kidding when i get out of here  youre gonna throw me the  biggest party this towns ever seen   all right      back at the model home   lindsay sings wrong word  stop it

what  weve got now   lindsay spit it out   and michael arrived home  determined to prove that he was in fact fun  i just booked us a little fishing trip   but why what did i do   hmm no no this is a fun thing  okay something ive always wanted to do with you  everybodys always having  fun around here why cant we   already down get  your finger out of my throat its down   anyway i thought you hated

and um  im just worried that im not  gonna be able to fall asleep  for another two hours and 45 minutes  so i was thinking maybe i would go  down and check out maebys band  and you could go see if  gobs bachelor party has started  shh shh shh im right where i want to be  gob had his chance to have me there  but if youre sure that you cant sleep  its just i dont know when im  gonna get another chance like this  you know to be there for family   right   id hate to miss it  because i was  too proud  right  wait a minute too proud what  does this have to do with too proud  actually that part was kinda just for you  i was just worried the whole thing wasnt  gonna land unless i included the pride part   upstairs gob was  preparing to set up the accountant  under his fathers helpful gaze   who called the cops  and  with the aid of some helpful gays  you told me to hire  people to look like my friends  theyre hot cops theyre entertainers  although i specifically asked  them not to come
