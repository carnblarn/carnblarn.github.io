                 now the story of a  wealthy family who lost everything  and the one son who had no  choice but to keep them all together  its arrested development  michael was sharing his bed  for the first time in years  unfortunately it was with  his younger brother buster  buster buster  heyhey whoa whoa buster   hey brother   sighs  i dont think us sleeping  together is working out  youre a grown man you  should be living with your mother   yeah i miss mom  i can tell   hey good morning what are  you doing   its my ethics essay  im supposed to write 200  words on the morality of war  whether a preemptive strike is ever justified  absolutely its preemptive you  know happens before something else so  if you can predict  aggression and you wanna squash it  i dont know why youre  not typing this is all good  im not sure if my ethics teacher  would love if i cheated on my essay  well you just passed my ethics test   in fact george michael  had developed a hopeless crush  on his ethics teacher a woman named beth baerly  even minor crimes are punishable  by brutally chopping off the offenders hand  mmm no ring   cant wait to meet her at  parentteacher night   oh yeah dad hey dad   try to remember everything she  says about me  all right  okay  michael  i need you to do something about my son  i totally agree mom buster  goes home we flip the mattress   this never happened  not buster read this  did you and dad adopt a child  the sec was onto us  your father thought it  would make us look charitable  he must have forged my signature  well maybe ill get a son who will  finish his cottage cheese  youve got to get me out of this  ill call social services  but you must take buster back   okay  great  but im not taking care of him either  i dont have the milk of  mothers kindness in me anymore  yeah that udders been dry  for a while now hasnt it   kind of     hello   gob michael  ive got a couple of girls here  a couple of fun girls   i thought id bring you in  on  oh i dont know gob  come on michael so we  had a little disagreement    recently gob had  discovered that  michael    michael yelling   was interested in his now  exgirlfriend marta   yelling continues  im offering you an olive branch here  yeahyeah no li know and  li appreciate that its just  besides when was the last  time you slept with someone   buster  what time and where   meanwhile lindsay was  helping george michael with his homework   oh come on lets do something  its just a stupid  essay  no i cant  i dont want to let down ms  baerly shes nice you know   and shes interesting  and pretty  well i dont know why im telling you this  i guess theres just some things  you cant really say to your dad  ah sounds like youd like her  to be more than just your teacher   lindsay believed that george  michael wanted to fix up his father  so he could fill the role ofhis mother  theres nothing wrong with that  although i must say im a little  hurt that you havent considered me  youre my aunt     scoffs that doesnt matter  aunts can fill that role  teachers can fill that role  and someday youre gonna find  the right woman to fill that role  but until then ill be right across the hall   lindsay had never been more proud  of anything she had said in her entire life   yikes    meanwhile gob  was waiting for michael to show up   oh there he is michael  yes  this is shannon the girl  ive been telling you all about  yes girl indeed young girl   thats a young young  young girl   yeah well shes 18  so its like oh and this is   your date nazh  galia   hello my  god  well shannon  wouldnt go out without a chaperone   right  and so shes your date   it was clear that gob  wasnt offering an olive branch at all  and in fact was still  harboring some resentment over marta   oh  laughs nagarma  youve got a mustache  hey   i mean youve got milk on  your mustache  oh  chuckles  i mean youve got  a milk mustache   yeah   its adorable you look like one of  those got milk  models   men chuckling   but gob mistook michaels  basic human decency for romantic interest  and felt a competitive urge to step in  because you know its  beyond adorable and eexotic  i find you  very attractive    nazhgalia michael shannon really   and george sr was  about to get a surprise visitor  mr bluth im cindi lightballoon  ive studied all your  teachings and ive purchased every tape  and i watch em over and over   george sr had recently  marketed a line of selfhelp tapes  touting his newly discovered spirituality  ive also lost four pounds on your  lowcarb bluth banana jail bars  giggles  ive come to learn at your feet  thats a good place to start   and michael free ofhis double  date met lindsay at parentteacher night  hey linds is it my imagination  or does this rape room have the  same floor plan as our kitchen  did you meet ms baerly yet the  ethics teacher cause i just did  no not yet look these are our cabinets  yeah well i think shes perfect for you   for me really  mmhmm  thanks but no ive already been  set up once today by a sibling  and i dont think you people know my type  hey look its not coming  from me itsits george michael  he told me i think he wants a mother  well thats ridiculous hes  got you hes got our mother  youd think that would turn  him off to the entire concept  besides im not gonna rush out and marry  somebody just because you  think my son would like it  welcome im ms baerly the ethics teacher  my goal is to teach your children  about the preciousness oflife  that can be lost by the  mindless pulling of a trigger  mmm no ring   and so michael got  to know his sons ethics teacher  ethics right and wrong    chuckles   how can one thing  can be right and another one be wrong   i mean which is which  you know   both
