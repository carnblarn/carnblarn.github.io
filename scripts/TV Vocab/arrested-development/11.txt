                now the story of a wealthy  family who lost everything  and the one son who had no choice  but to keep them all together  its arrested development   michael  bluth was taking his son  to an interview at the  prestigious milford school  an institution once famous for its credo  that children should be neither seen nor heard  woman   whispers theyre not getting in   i might not get in either and that  wouldnt be the end  of the world   shh  were not even going down that road okay  the next four years are all about your future  and thats the most important thing to me okay  things have changed around here we  have talking sessions throughout the day  we even have a talking room  where students are encouraged  to go in and talk to their hearts content   sounds like fun   first thing hes said all day  the point is im not my father  i do think its best for the milford school  to distance itself from the bluth name  its nothing personal  are you talking about the  fact that my father is in jail  because i dont like to be  compared to my father either   i dont mind being compared to my  father  save it  for the talk room   sorry  i can assure you  that my family is back on track   and no longer in any trouble   not according to todays paper  oh god what have we done this time   dont ever mention klimpys  to me again   what did you do  if i still had money id buy a  klimpys just to burn it to the ground  i know mom you hate  klimpys tell me what happened  your sister and i tried to get  into that new restaurant rud  and they wouldnt let us in  mrs bluth theres absolutely no room  come on ive suddenly lost my appetite  oh whos going to believe that   with her blood  sugar at a perilous low  lucille made lindsay pull  into the nearest restaurant  welcome to klimpys anywhere you like  this does not bode well   ill have the ike and  tina tuna  plate or platter   i dont understand the  question and i wont respond to it   and what would you like   id like my old life back  so there really was no fight  well one tiny thing at the end  how can you treat me this way   oh  please everything ive said about you  can be covered with makeup and  a lie about a thyroid problem  good grief almighty you think  im enjoying my slide into poverty  sorry lindsay there goes your dessert  why dont you eat it mother  why dont you just take this  cake and shove it  beeps  hey who called the cops  it was all just a big misunderstanding  totally blown out of proportion  well listen i think it cost george  michael a chance to go to the milford school  oh big deal busters the  only one who ever liked it   buster so excelled at  being neither seen nor heard  that he remained at the school  undetected for a full two semesters  after he was supposed to graduate  nonetheless this bad press is  starting to taint my sons future  and weve got to put an end to it  michael if this is a lecture on how were  all supposed to whatever  and blah blah blah  well you can save it  cause we all know it by heart   goodbye  missus  lindsay youll  be happy to know that i have a new idea  i met a publicist today im gonna hire her   we need somebody to make us look  good   i say  its a waste of money  were plenty sympathetic as we are   is this your onion  yes   whats in the  foil  nothing  its a ball of foil for my son  have a great day sweetie  i dont know how she cant  so this publicist michael is she cute   i never really  noticed   in  fact michael had noticed her at the gym  but only recently gotten up  the nerve to talk to her  giving him a chance to  work on his flirting skills  race you to the top of the hill  which had gotten rusty over the years   ill race you to the top of the  hill  i  brought a picnic lunch  hey that hill was really   jessie bowers  if you ever have any public relations needs  my relations are already a  little too public im michael bluth   from the bluth company  thats right  im giving you my direct line  okay sure shes shes cute i suppose  i mean now that youre making  me think about it uh shes cute  shes a cutie shes a little  cutie pie but i never really noticed   why dont you just ask her  out  thats not an option   cause youre scared   no because of george michael  he still hasnt gotten over losing his mother  i just want to get him through  high school then well deal with me  so you didnt get any while  you were in high school  and now youre not gonna get any  while george michaels in high school   and so the family  gathered at the model home  eager to hear their new publicists plan   get jobs and behave   instead of us getting jobs  why dont you do your job and  tell everyone weve got jobs   i have a job   coughs kiss ass  well we were all thinking it  uh im unclear about what it is exactly you do  excellent question a publicist  no no i was talking to george michael  when did you get a job   at the banana stand  oh duh  i thought you meant like a plumber or something  and i was like when did that happen  laughs  jessie why dont you just  go ahead andjump in here  its a tough group to keep focused  im going on the offensive i want  to get an article in the paper  to show that this is a  functional family and a relatable family  are we on hello hello from prison  thanks tojessie for setting up this telelink  ive started a torah study  group im very excited about it  looks like i dont know looks  like i have some possible converts  your fathers religious now well play that up  your fathers religious now well play that up   its very sympathetic   yeah who doesnt love thejews  and it allows me to put michael front and center  he needs to be the new face of this family  hes the only likable one  in the bunch no offense   none taken   im sorry  isnt michael the least  likable one in the family  no there are very few intelligent  attractive and straight men in this town  well that certainly leaves me out  she she said single  you did say single correct i thought l  i didnt quite hear that the reception is bad  but as the talmud tells us   tvaudio breaking up  to the jackal as to an oxen   laughs did it get a laugh  sorry im still on the whole  michael being likable thing  you know that hes only had sex  with like four women right   lets focus on your likability  youre going to start doing  some charity work with your magic  actually im kind of the  charitable one of the family   i think its best if you  got a job  oh come on  im a parent i care about my daughter every  bit as much as michael cares about his son  what grade am i in   what kind of job   something where youll be seen  i represent cloudmir vodka  and they want someone to promote  it by ordering it at a hot bar   a place like rud  okay ill do it  and tobias youre a medical doctor  and youre living an absurd fantasy as an actor   its time to get real  wow  its tough talk but i like it  youre saying land a major film  im saying get your medical license back  ive set up a hearing for tomorrow in boston   michael has generously donated  1100 for your  trip  im sorry  i truly believe that the universe  wants me to be an actor and not a doctor  im just waiting for a sign   heres your cash   universal shuttle picks you  up at 800   any sign really  sorry some of my students  are arguing the significance  of the shank bone on the seder plate  but that not not wag our  genitals at one another to make a point   thought provoking  and  lucille people think youre cold   hanukkah can be spelled so  many ways oh  god   yelling   buster  right here ready to go  at your service get me out there  i want you to stay in  people find you odd and alienating  you make them uneasy stay out of the spotlight  i shall be neither seen nor heard watch me  you can always tell a milford man   each with their new charge  the bluths set about redefining their image  tobias was off to los  angeles international airport  determined to return to his family with a career  well this is great  why

out with her  you know i have to do the right thing for my son  then you better get her back  because the guy i lost was earl milford   what  i didnt know it was him  although he was spectacularly
