                now the story of a wealthy  family who lost everything  and the one son who had no choice  but to keep them all together  its arrested development   against his  betterjudgment michael  had recently set out  to have an uncomplicated  onenight stand with this woman  and at his brothers  suggestion he gave a false identity  chareth cutestory   and what started as a night  of passion with no strings attached  got complicated the next morning  when michael found out she was blind  he decided to keep seeing her  so as not to appear superficial   if its a onenight stand im not  very good at it   chuckles wow  but arent you busy with the trial and everything   unfortunately the woman also  turned out to be his fathers prosecutor  and so michael went to  maggies to reveal his identity   but before he  could  its an  overview of the governments case  against the bluth family  what do you think do we have a case   mouthing words   meanwhile  michaels son george michael  discovered that his cousin  maeby had been living a double life    coughing  maeby what are you doing  i still dont get why youre pretending to  be two people and why is one of you sick   hey you dont get giant checks if  youre healthy    please welcome surely fnke  plus whos going to get mad at the dying girl   surelys  dying  i figure ill  kill her off just before graduation   just so everyone gets really sad  before prom    someones going to get hurt  not to mention its kind of  disrespectful for kids who actually have this   not a lot of kids have bs  these days  what  does that stand for  i dont know its bs   michael wrestled with the dilemma  of whether he should look at the  evidence file of the case against his father   michael  hey gob  what the hell are you wearing  what oh this  the wife likes me in bright sweaters   gob in a  series of escalating dares  recently got married to a woman  he had only known for an evening  your wife shes still your wife  well i went to break up with her  last night but my timing was not great  so i think  we should talk  my parents are getting a divorce   crying why arent you  wearing that sweater i bought you   what you dont like it   no of course i like it  just because i like it doesnt mean i have  to wear it i dont wear everything i like  why dont we just get a  divorce everybody else is  no were not getting divorced  she really wants to stay together so  well least you finally consummated it huh   laughs consummated  what is up with that  prosecutie    groans   i hope you didnt break  up with her  no i didnt  and to make matters worse she gave me this  its a summary of the  evidence that they have against dad  okay michael this makes matters better  lets just destroy it and move on with our lives  this is not the actual evidence  its just a list of the evidence  and judging by the amount of boxes she has  in her place i have a feeling theres a lot  a feeling oh dont tell me you  wont open it on ethical grounds  im not sure what im going to do   what is with the insane moral  code in this  family  yes we did it  were getting rid of the ten commandments  the granite ones in front of the courthouse  you know all it took was the threat of a lawsuit  youre involved with those  protesters now when did that happen  oh who can remember   lindsays  involvement began hours before  when leaving the plea  hearing she first determined  the ten commandments  didnt belong there   and they wont even allow me  one lousy  cigarette   gasps  honey theyre just heels they  can only support so much weight  ive always been very passionate  about the separation  of church and state   what are you gonna do with  them  give em to a school  can we let another family  bring down the ten commandments  this familys already done more than its share  oh now you love the ten commandments  and yet youre the one who so  conveniently forgot thou  shalt protect thy father  and honor no one above him  unless it beith me thy sweet lord  im not sure that one made  it down the mountain gob   i told you someone would get  hurt  if i  knew it was you   i wouldnt have been so  worried  hey  what happened to you  he was trying to help some handicapped  girl up to the bleachers and he fell  its just a sprain but at least its legitimate  ah le clumsy adolescence its  a phase weve all been through  except for me i was like a cat  i always ended up on all fours   like a cat  wait a minute  they dont have ramps at your school   well not up the bleachers   you should threaten to sue   its free if its just a threat  you know  hey  thats a good idea  no ones gonna sue anybody  im not gonna have my son  start abusing the legal system  like the rest of this family  after all were gonna need it for years to come   and thats when  michael decided to do the right thing  so what do you think do we have a  case against this idiot family or what  well thats actually why i  wanted to talk to you maggie  you see uh it turns out that i  am actually one of those idiots  i might even be the main idiot well im not  the main idiot but im the idiot in charge  yeah im michael bluth okay  and i want you to know that i  never opened up this folder  and if you could see my face  uh youd see how sorry i am that i lied to you  you feel sincere  damn it i have spent the  last five hours hating you  ever since i found out you  were michael bluth in court   what how did you know  im blind michael   im not stuffed up  you smelled me   i smelled  you baby  maggie  why didnt you tell me at your house  and why did you give me this folder  i was manipulating you this isnt the real list   this is a wish list  i  cant believe you set me up  well you lied to me chareth cutestory  i knowthou shalt not make up a name in vain  but you know i walked into  that court and i saw you there  and this cant happen right  youre damn right this cant happen  look at me this could get me  are you actually looking at me   yes i am  okay i  could get disbarred for this  and your dad would have to  spend tons more time in prison  i gotta tell you something the  thing that really gets to me is  that i keep hearing that  michael bluth is so  beeps cute  well i know maggie lizer is  adorable you dont know what youre missing   really  really   so what are we  gonna do  i guess were  just gonna have to go our separate ways   and agree to never speak about this  again  that is  probably best huh  the least you can do is buy me a drink  hmm yeah ill stay for one drink   maggie whooping   the next morning michael  once again found himself at maggies   and once again berated  himself for the  mistake  oh no  im supposed to be at the prison  to talk to my dad in half an hour   i cant believe we did  this again   it was so stupid  incredibly stupid its like were  making naughty sex even naughtier   both panting  oh no i was supposed to be at the  prison to talk to my dad a half an hour ago  oh this is bad this is really bad  this is the second most  unethical thing ive ever done   we cannot pretend that this didnt  happen maggie   or  that it wont happen again   you think its gonna  happen again  you tell me   lets just assume that it will  happen again at some  time  right right  we just need to you know  acknowledge this and keep it private   and i dont think that theres  anything wrong  with that  right  i have a job you know im  trying to keep a man in prison   right and that man happens  to be my father   groans   this could  get ugly  well  its like the ten commandments saying   be true to thine own self and to  thine own  self  be true yeah   number seven  well  just have to keep it a secret   our secret  our dirty little secret   i think im ready now  all right  okay   thirtytwo minutes earlier  gob lucille and barry met with george sr   where did you  get this  they dont  call me a  sleightofhand artist for nothing   gob had switched out the file  while his siblings  discussed the ten commandments   ive always been very passionate  about the separation  of church and state    what are you gonna do  with them   give em to a school   can we let another  family bring down the ten commandments  now you love the ten commandments  apparently there are boxes of  it at the prosecutors house  i tracked down the address and  you should be thanking me for this  michael didnt want you to  have it  mocking mr moral  mm yeah we did something right there huh   so what do you think  barry  li havent read it  i had a really interesting date last night  a woman who actually works two jobs  well it certainly looks  like theyve got a lot on us  mmhmm   uh you i  was raising the children  when was the last time you raised children  excuse me ive got two in the  waiting room right this moment   in fact buster and annyong  lucilles newly adopted  korean child were waiting  wow i wonder what  theyre talking about in there   they dont tell you  anything huh   they tell me things  it doesnt matter though because  dad is gonna be in here a long time    chuckles  no we have court day today  they take plea daddy come home you out   annyong had hit a  nerve and buster recalled  that right before george sr s  arrest hed made a similar threat  i said he could wear that  tie it looks better on him  no no let me help you with that son   oh  hey enjoy yourself tonight  because you are out of here  im not gonna spend my retirement  watching you wipe your nose on your sleeve   i cant breathe dad  neither can i    whimpers  i  havent seen half this stuff  but theyve got these kind of  documents uh weve gotta get rid of this  if youre thinking of stealing the  evidence that is a very big offense  li think im gonna say that i  signed myself out about 10 minutes ago  youre right you cant afford to get caught  i dont need my lawyer in  prison well have gob break in  well gee dad ive got a wife now  i dont think that i can  afford to get caught either  good point you might want  to change out of that sweater  tell me again why this isnt wrong  look we are just were two  adults weve got absolutely nothing   cops hide   ms lizer   its officer kelley  oh hi  your office has asked me to  come pick you up its a surprise   i just winked its a  surprise witness  oh great   um  how are we doing  ill just put my dog inside  and then i will be right with you  ill take the dog okay ive  already missed my meeting you go ahead  just put him through  the doggy door   okay  and uh ill see  you in court   yeah   my dads not gonna put  himself in  prison for life  yeah   bye kiss  oh   and gob decided to pass  offhis breakin assignment to tobias  hey theres the cat sorry you  couldnt have been down at the prison with us   dad was asking all about  you  oh i  doubt that very much  look im not gonna lie to you he feels  youve been sucking off this family far too long  if you dont start pulling your weight  around here its gonna be shape up or ship up  you know try as i might i  cannot seem to impress that man  isnt that funny  chuckles  im about to knock his socks off again  yeah im gonna break into this house  thats got a bunch of evidence in it  just to borrow it ensure his freedom forever  but its a tough job might require some agility  but its a tough job might require some agility   whispering this kind of agility  lets go little man   michael meanwhile had decided  to see what life in maggies world was like  all right okay  all right okay   okay  this guys the  real deal hes on the inside  but hes got  some demands  this could be the break we wanted   this is district attorney  lizer   all  right what do you want  uh li want immunity for me and my mom  and i want my dad to stay in prison  also can you send annyong back to korea   huh    hey  justice    horn honking     meanwhile maggies  interrogation of buster was proving fruitless  do you know anything about  your fathers trips overseas  i knew id have a fun time at home alone with mom  fine did you ever see him  return from these trips   with anything unusual  yeah  he came back home once with a black statue  with an erect penis  it stayed in our living  room until my aunt objected  what about business associates   i have none  all right  this guys wasting our time  take away his grilled cheese   stammering wait wait wait wait  if its evidence you want i know where  they keep it according to my brother  there are boxes of evidence in  a house on scenic view drive   isnt that where you live  yeah  and im headed there now   tobias meanwhile  had used his catlike agility   to get the evidence at  maggies house  the cat is in   unfortunately it  was just as maggie came home   sniffing   sniffs is there someone here   tobias concerned about  maggies heightened sense of smell  set off to cloak himself in her scent   and michael was at the  vets office   justice is fine   great  although dressing  him up like a seeingeye dog   seems a little cruel  cruel  well yeah because he cant see  what are you talking about  mr bluth justice is blind  justice cannot be blind doc  hes got a handle and everything come on boy  maybe his peripheral isnt great  but hes been leading a blind woman around  i think shes been leading him around  but that would mean that maggie isnt blind   in fact maggie wasnt blind   but had been pretending  to be  son of a bitch  since she found it helpful in taking the lsats  d b places fourth   a   finding it a tremendous  boon to her professional life   maggie  continued the ruse  i  submit into evidence this wine glass   with the defendants  fingerprints    glass shatters   dont worry youre so  ahead    clicks tongue chuckles  her ability to see however  was currently proving a disadvantage  as she couldnt reveal to the  man she recognized as tobias  that she knew he was there  without betraying her secret  and tobias was finding her an  uncannily difficult blind girl to outmaneuver  their game of cat and mouse continued  until michael showed up to return justice  oh justice what is it boy what is it  is there some jackass in my bathrobe    spraying   both screaming  oh i cant see  and later the family gathered at the  courthouse to respond to the plea offer  they dont have a case against  us i took care of everything   something smells wonderful  well thank you  would that i could say that  i wore it to impress you  but no im afraid its merely a  cloaking agent from a sadly blunderous afternoon  who else have we got what about buster  worstcase scenario he  gets caught no more buster  im not going anywhere  youre the one whos staying put  not me you  whats gotten into you  have you been eating cheese   outside the courthouse  surely fnke was addressing the crowd  george michael prepared to confront her about it  not just to me but to all  handicapped kids out there  who are sick and tired of sitting in  the front rows at basketball games   george michael spotted his father  and not wanting to appear to be abusing  the legal system found a place to hide  michael determined to expose  maggie hid to avoid tipping his hand  it was then however that lindsays  advocacy group had their big moment  hey george michael what are you doing here  i just thought id come down  and see the family see everyone   oh  thats why im here  well pal you dont need to  do that you can head on home  why dont you go help that  handicapped friend of yours   she kind of lied to me  i  was recently lied to myself  and for what its worth george michael  you cannot let people get away with that  its just so hard to know  what the right thing to do is  i know it its not like  theres some list of rules  handed down to us from on high   no  watch your head       so michael set out to expose in  court that maggie wasnt really blind   shes right there what are  we gonna do  i got a plan  your honor the purpose of a  court of law is to find the truth  which is why witnesses swear on this  after all they sayjustice is blind  surely she has enough sight to catch the truth  before it hits her in the face   objection your   all gasp   unfortunately maggie  had been temporarily blinded that day   i cant see  bailiff  that was my plan what do you got   so george michael decided to  once and for all put an end to surely fnke   i need to  talk to you  and  this is the man who inspired me   george michael bluth    he is the one who is responsible  for the new ramps at our school  and he will carry on my  legacy and put an end to bs  surely can  beat this thing    together no more bs no more bs   and michael reunited with  maggie who had been kicked off the case  i really thought you were  lying to me i am so sorry  michael ive been doing this  blind act thing for years its wacked   are you going to admit that you were  faking it  i  think im gonna go for  i was struck by the bible  and it restored my sight   laughs  so what about us we were  starting to establish some trust  except for all the lies  you know i was originally looking  for something completely uncomplicated  yeah me too forget it this is so over  you know were saying goodbye  and this is actually the first time  that i feel that you can really see me  yeah  were just two people staring at each other  fully exposed in a court of law     justice  whistles  on the next arrested development  barry gets a sign from god  i will obey your will i will lead a good life  well the hell with this then  and maggie is replaced with a  new less generous prosecutor  i was made to understand there  were grilled cheese sandwiches here
