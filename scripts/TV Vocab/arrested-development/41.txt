                now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything  and the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together  its arrested development  michael bluth began his day with something hed never seen before  im hearing good things about the bluth company what do you think  good news about his familys housing business  old man bluths in jail i think his son is running the company  doesnt seem like a total moron to me  you know what ive had this thing as a triple sell  and i am upgrading it right here right now  i think this thing could even go as high as a dont buy  dont buy  huh mom did you see that  dont buy bluth  you build a house thats good people are going to want to come  the sinkhole spread a little bit more last night  anyway im going to go to the prison  im going to tell dad about this news  i thought you said we shouldnt visit him  uh visit no gloat yes  ive worked very very hard for this i sold the cabin property to keep us afloat  i havent had any time to spend with my son  well now you can spend time with my son  i want your brother buster to come live with you  and its not because he has that horrible hook for a hand now  its the snoring  listen to this  this is buster snoring wednesday night  its driving me craz  you wont even know hes here  you seem more villainous than usual mom are you sober  michael its 800 am  so its not that  i dont know  maybe its because i went off my postpartum medication  you were still taking that you had buster 32 years ago  and thats how long ive been depressed about him  actually i did go off it in the early 90s  but i didnt like what happened to me  claiming she could take it no more the young mother released the emergency brake  allowing her car to roll backwards into the nearby lake  good for her  i must have gained three pounds  whyd you go off them this time  well apparently moodaltering medication leads to street drugs  thats what this very handsome young doctor said on the today show  that was tom cruise the actor  they said he was some kind of scientist  maybe you should get away from buster  why dont you go up to the cabin in the woods  i thought you said we sold it  we sold the property i worked it out so that we could relocate the cabin  but it is going to be up in tahoe for another couple of days  maybe you can take a date up there  how am i supposed to find someone willing to go into that musty old claptrap  the cabin yes th well that would be difficult too  please get back on the meds mom we miss the old old you  i didnt even know that we had a cabin  ah  bleep   well for what its worth gob ive never actually been there  although hed often been promised  hey pal somethings come up  this nice young lady has lost her puppy  and your dads got to help her find him  oh bad news buddy  this young ladys dad is sick and  im taking her to the hospital  come on youre old enough to figure this out im nailing this broad  pardon me if i dont burst into tears michael  but at least he promised to take you  he just let me blindly enjoy my childhood  i didnt even know there was a cabin he wasnt taking me to  hmm mines sadder  i dont see you crying robot  you taste these tears  taste my sad michael  i am not going to lick your eye okay  well i will tell you this michael  i dont have a son  he does  but if i ever do im either going to take him to the cabin in the woods  or im going to promise to take him and then not take him  but the one thing that i will never do is not tell him  that im taking him to a cabin in the woods and then not take him  gob was growing up  well the cabin in the woods is going to be stacked up next to our carport  but maybe we should head up there tonight huh  one first time  taste the happy michael  taste it  tastes kind of like sad  michael set off to prison to tell off his father when he discovered his son  george michael  dad hey  what are you doing  i didnt want to miss you because youve been leaving so early lately  you slept out here to see me  michael had never been so touched by something his son had said  but it wasnt true  he was hiding from his cousin after an awkward incident  theyd since been trying to avoid each other  which was difficult considering they shared a bunk bed   oh hi  hi   im off to the car  ill be in the crawl space  tell you what how would you like to head up to the cabin  can you afford to skip work  i think the president of a dont buy company can afford to take a day off  were up from sell   its happening isnt it  its really happening  and its time for us to start creating some memories  you know theres been enough disappointment in this family  theres only one sleeping bag so were going to have to double up  sorry pal something came up  it is worse to know  gob was getting life lessons all over the place  and michael broke a twomonth silence and went to visit his father  you came  someone came  only to tell you that the company is back on track and its because youre behind bars  and now i get to do with my son what you never did with me  im taking him to the cabin  scar and every night they  im scarred too but my son is not going to be  and they cover it with soap and youre supposed to thank them   like theyre doing you a favor  thats all i came to say  is there anything youd like for me to pass on to the family  im your uncle  im your dads twin brother  im oscar  he switched on me  no one believes me  unfortunately for oscar youve got the wrong twin was a very popular alibi  you simply got the wrong twin  were quadruplets  you got the wrong two  were larry and dave  you want curtis and jack  i even started a web site imoscarcom  im innocent michael  im oscar  com  no no dont buy it im taking my son to the cabin  and theres nothing you can say to make me believe that you are not my father  i understand  your child comes first  oh my god youre oscar  com  so michael returned to the office to try and free his uncle  when he realized how much that freedom would cost his employees  dont buy we did it mikey were super rich again  and im going to buy a car the volvo  lindsay youre not going to start spending money and this is not a volvo  oh thats from sitting on the copier   lindsay no  michael ive got nothing  my husband dumped me and ran off to vegas with kitty  that bleached blonde whore  well hes definitely got a type  i cant believe he left me  i mean this and these and this  thats the car  oh  this  glad i didnt spring for color  lindsay the only reason you want tobias is because you cant have him  and the second that you can have something all of a sudden you dont want it  thats not who i am michael  well all right maybe youre right  maybe we should get you this car  yeah i dont know its so boxy  gob  oh michael  hows dad  uh i dont know its oscar who is in prison  and if i let him out people will know that dad is free and those people out there  will end up paying for it  dad hasnt tried to contact you has he  yeah like id ever hear from that son of a bitch  earlier that day gob received a letter from a group  that reunited abandoned sons with their fathers called sad  a fatherson reunion  dads still in prison  but now the letter made sense  that son of a bitch  law offices of barry zuckerkorn  hi its michael bluth for barry  barry went to reno to see your father  reno he said hes been visiting my father in prison  yeah barry says a lot of things he doesnt mean  well i guess im going to reno to look for dad  good luck favorite son  so once again michael went after the father whod once again abandoned him  only to find that he was about to do the same to his own son  its not happening is it  something came up  michael had just told his son they wouldnt be going to the cabin  right but the cabins in lake tahoe  so im saying thats right near reno we could just  yeah but you know this is going to be like an adult trip aunt lindsay will be here hi  hey why dont you pop a tent in front with your cousin maeby  what no  im not really the outdoorsy type  well then this is a good chance for you to rub off on her  as michael set out to find his father  gob thought he was doing the same  theres my guy  hey buddy come on  get them to track down your dad too  my dad actually had them track me down  but it does look like hes not going to show  i kind of feel like that kid who found the severed hand  hey dad look what i found  anything for his fathers approval  heartbreaking  you look familiar  i think thats because we actually kind of look alike  remember when i said gob had a son  im gob  i wasnt just saying that  in high school gob became intimate with these girls  these girls got pregnant  this one had a baby  and that baby would grow up to be   steve holt  steve holt  all i ever wanted was to spend a little time with my dad  maybe go camping  but i guess thatll never happen  look i know this is going to sound kind of crazy but  my family actually has a cabin in the woods for one more night  maybe we could go up to reno get the keys and go camping  you know sort of a sonandson thing  if steve had had a father he wouldve warned him not to go  into the woods with strange men but he didnt  sure   lets go  okay   this is me right here  oh okay   camping  whoo  michael meanwhile arrived in reno  a city competing with las vegas successful what happens in vegas stays in vegas campaign  and set about searching for barry zuckerkorn  im looking for a man whos probably in the seedy underbelly of reno  oh the christian league had the seedy underbelly shut down  now its a swallows  swallows was a familystyle restaurant by day   and an anythinggoes pansexual bazaar by night  hello and welcome to swallows  can i interest you in a smoothie or an amyl michael  tobias i thought that you were in vegas with kitty in the blue man group  no as it turns out the part that id destroyed my life to get had already been cast  the role was filled by george sr who used it to hide in plain sight  that is until he choked on a marshmallow  and almost died when no one noticed hed turned blue  so kitty suggested we come up here to try out in reno and  oh ill be honest michael  leaving lindsay was the biggest little mistake ive ever made  i cant seem to call her though damn this pride of mine  tuna melts up and you need to flip the cushions in the grind room  yes sir right away sir  oh great now im going to be smelling to high heaven like a tuna melt  tobias what would you say if i told you that lindsay might be willing to get back together with you  oh uh ill call her right now  actually why dont you let me handle it you know lindsay   she only wants what she cant have  right   what would you do about kitty  i cant lie to you michael  kitty left me two days ago  theres a blue hand print on the back of your head kitty  are you seeing someone else  face it tobias its over  say goodbye to these  those are blue too  there were blue hand prints on them  yes and i swear to you they werent  yours no i know it all points to dad  dads in reno kittys in reno dads in kitty  he must be a blue man im gonna go check out the theater  okay ill meet you there  i just have to break down the salad bar and set up the leather pony  whats the leather pony  i dont know we dont have that at lunch  so michael called lindsay to say hed found her husband  all right im on my way  ill just bring him back with me  he wants to come home  i mean against his will  well knock him out if you have to hes my husband  just watch the kids like you promised okay   im not  neither am i  hold it  and the kids found themselves closer than ever on the bumpy road to reno  hello  lindsay uh hey hi  michael said not to call you but i i missed you so much  you miss me   what are you doing  nothing  i was driving out there but this is crazy we have to be realistic  no no but the thing is i cant leave kitty  i just what with all the sexual intercourse and whatnot  you bastard   what are you doing  nothing  i will be backstage after the blue man show whether kitty likes it or not  sounds good one quick question though  what if kittys not there and im less of a blue man and more of a cocktail waitress   shes turning again  hang up hang up  ill see you there thank you bye  michael was already at the theater looking for george sr  when he ran into barry doing the same thing  hey barry  hi mikey  so how much do you know  i know that oscar is in prison and that my father is a blue man  and that you are clearly in cahoots with him  ooh a lot  yeah where is he  i dont know i was gonna meet him here but he must have seen you and run off  i was gonna give him this 250000 and a passport  just a passport  i was up for so long  barry youre fired  what  just like that  no warning  youre my only client  what am i supposed to do now  turn tricks on the street  how much you think i can get for that by the way  all right this is crazy ive got to let oscar out of prison  what about making out  50 or is that just la am i just  soon lindsay arrived at the hotel and the kids finally faced facts  look it was just a halfkiss all right  maybe thats the reason why were acting weird  its because we didnt finish the kiss  is that where   yeah  yeah i mean  do you think we should just finish the kiss get it out of the way  lets get it out of the way  hey kids bring the bags were sharing a room  all right lets meet back here tomorrow morning   okay  yeah   go  oh you  yeah im gonna um im gonna stay out here and uh  and watch that famous reno sunset  isnt it behind you  theres yeah but theres mirrors  itll actually look closer  while george michael waited for the sunset another set of sons arrived  michael said hed meet me here  i guess ill get the keys to the cabin son  ill go buy some fishing stuff son  so where did you get this kid  yeah i guess i can tell you now  we were both waiting for our dads at that garden where the little boy found the arm  the kids amazing though its almost like  i wish he could be my dad  okay um your dads not trying to find you your son is  that kids your son  youre the dad  hmm  ive made a huge tiny mistake  no no gggob gob you cant just leave your son in the middle of a parking lot in reno  and thats when michael saw his own son in a parking lot in reno  he drove all the way up here to be with me wow  well i guess im uh im no better than  no im better  they were an hour out of reno when george michael woke up  you were out like a light pal our dreams are about to come true  maeby  definitely we are going camping  its finally happening  its never happening  michael had just surprised his sleeping son by taking him camping  i put this off too long and its too important  your uncle oscar can stay in prison one more day right  not according to that days blog on imoscarcom  this here is way more important than me trying to find my father  although i was very close i almost had pop up in reno  me too  as michael was forcibly taking his son out to the cabin  lucille was ready to forcibly throw hers out  well that was a freebie  lucille didnt trust herself to be in the house when buster returned  so she headed off to the cabin michael said would be unoccupied  tobias meanwhile was looking for a way to make his wife jealous  by convincing her that he was not only a blue man but still with kitty  when he came across a makeup woman who coincidentally looked a great deal like kitty  if this tableau i recreate perhaps i can resnare my mate  gee why wouldnt she want him back  and michael and his son arrived at the cabin in the woods  looks like they have trucked off the bedrooms  maybe well just set up some sleeping bags right here in the living room huh  lucille meanwhile heard a familiar sound  oh come on  mother  what the hell are you doing back there  i decided to sleep in the car so my snoring wouldnt bother you  and i left that recording of my snoring so you wouldnt know im gone  were halfway to the cabin  im going to drop you by this light  or i could come with you  that might be the exact shot in the arm our relationship needs  well at least ill have someone to talk to on the way up  this is fun isnt it  this is just like when we used to live up in the attic  yeah  or or we could go back to reno  go back to reno  you dont want to be here  i mean youve been sleeping in the stair car just so we could spend time together  thats not totally true though  im just in the middle of a problem right now  oh yeah well lets lets talk about it  i cant talk about it with you  why not  its just its about a girl and youre not gonna like this   is it about ann  no  oh then of course im going to like it  i i i like ann  no it its just its a problem without an answer  well every problem has an answer  youre probably just confused because youre going through all of this alone  and thats exactly why we need to spend this time together  yeah i guess so  i know so  so heres the plan tomorrow morning were gonna get up early  before we tell the cops that pop up escaped from prison  were going to go down to the lake were gonna discuss your girl problem  and its going to be fun  especially the part with the cops  all right whatever your problem is with the girl were going to figure it out  thats what this place is for  that and cheating on gangee  you know im really glad you brought me here dad  yeah we needed this  and this time im not gonna let the family drag me away  and the next morning michael rose early to spend the day with his son  only to find himself once again dragged away by his family  dad what the hell are you doing  sorry i cant let you let oscar out of prison or theyll come for me  hey how do you like the cabin  on the next arrested development  lucille arrives at the cabin   bleep  me theres no cabin  mother  oh my god  you still doing breakfast burritos  maeby finds someone to help her forget her cousin  being stood up  yeah me too  her cousin  want to make out  yeah sure why not  and lindsay catches up with tobias  get your hands off my husband kitty  did someone say husband  i want a divorce  and i would be thrilled to represent either one of you  thatll be uh 50
