                now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything  and the one son who had no choice  but to keep them all together  its arrested development  michael bluth had set up a meeting with cal cullen  owner of one of the largest parcels ofland in orange county  i hope that i can prove to you that we have a very impressive company  well your family did not come off well on last nights scandalmakers   scandalmakers was a show  that reenacted headlinegrabbing stories  the latest was about the bluth family  the rights of which had been signed away by tobias  in exchange for the part of george sr   when allegations surfaced hed illegally built homes in iraq  george bluth sr assisted by his secretary kitty  escaped the country   due to poor acting the burden of the story was placed on the narrator   only to be found hiding under one of the homes that he built   he was actually found in a hole near the house  but this inattention to detail was typical   of the laziness the shows narrator was known for  i cant survive under the house  perhaps an attic shall i seek   real shoddy narrating just pure crap  but were back on track and we are scandalfree  hey you start the meeting without me  mother uh this is cal cullen you remember my mother lucille  were right in the middle of talking  about this exciting giveaway spa package to entice buyers  you know hes never taken me anywhere  oh no we have to live high and dry  well youre certainly not dry  michael im not a prude but its 100 in the afternoon is your mother drunk  id have to get up pretty early to get drunk by 100    as it turns out she had gotten up early  and had taken pain medication because of a hangoverrelated headache  however she mistook the drowsy eyealcohol warning  for a winking eyealcohol suggestion  fortunately she had the good sense not to drive herself to the meeting  no ill call for a car  unfortunately this was after a failed attempt to do so     who the hell put  michael im sorry i cannot do business with you  i mean i couldnt afford to end up on scandalmakers  oh you could afford to do anything you want youre just a big chicken       michael realized it might be time  to deal with his mothers apparent problem  okay that seems as good a place as any to end the meeting  no im not doing another intervention with her  last time i felt terrible for a week   one year earlier the family had tried an intervention   youre pouring a drink what are you doing  what if shes mad   good point  perhaps ill have a little sip of something  guys what could she do to us  do we have anything single malt   and although the intervention didnt work    we think you have a prollen  youre a mesh   it turned into one of the bluth familys better parties       well maybe an intervention is the wrong approach  what about rehab she was just a mess at the meeting  where were you by the way i couldve used your help with mom  i believe i told you i was gonna be out for the holidays its spring break  not that i can enjoy it my reputations been ruined  by that jerk phillip litt who put my one magic show flub on his dvd   gob had performed a magic act at an earlier spring break  to get exposure on the bestselling video series  girls with low selfesteem  or two flubs or whatever   there were seven flubs  and after the show he signed a release   youre not gonna use the time that i screwed up right  that wasnt part of the act   come on man id never do anything to embarrass you     please    oh uh you dont know a good bird hospital do you  youre getting all this right  well at least the orange county register didnt say of your performance  if this is who george sr is lets hope he remains missing  meanwhile they loved dave attells risky choice  of wearing cutoffs while portraying me   in fact mr attell was portraying  tobiass actual nevernude affliction  but this perplexed the scandalmakers audience  due to the unfocused nature of the narrators explanation  no i think mines worse you shouldve seen what happened to me on the boardwalk today  they were laughing at me me    those tapes are awful women tricked into taking their tops off  i have a daughter i dont want corrupted by the media   unbeknownst to lindsay  maeby was a fairly prominent member of the media  as she had secretly conned her way into a job as a film executive  this young man on the beach script sucks  shed go to the guy just cause he said shes awesome   you call that dialogue  hey i didnt write it  no but youre gonna fix it its a spring break movie find out what they sound like  oh yeah right do you really think i look collegeaged  im not drunk but im willing to be hint  oh mort youre gonna be so easy to blackmail hint  this pig phillip litt is out there asking girls to take their tops off   its an outrage  well of course you feel that way youre jealous  youre a surfboard but i do agree he is a pig  hey what the hell was that for  can we stop worrying about girls with low selfesteem  and start focusing on sobering up the woman who gave us ours   what do you think about rehab  she wont go willingly i can tell you that  may i make a suggestion get implants really  wha come on this stuff is expensive   so michael set out to convince his mother that she needed help  hello hello i have a surprise for you   did i win the prize  you won the prize  i won the prize i won the prize for what  we were gonna give one employee a week at the spa  we were even gonna put them in the ad but then i thought  what about mom shes elegant she deserves it  i was gonna tell you at the office but then i thought  no if i bring her around now she might vomit on the overhead projector  im so embarrassed about that i dont think i was supposed to drink with my medication   actually it wasnt even her medication  of course i cant take oscar to an elegant place  his only remaining pair of pants blew apart the other day  i was thinking that i would go with you for the week  so what i just stay here alone im not exactly equipped to run this place by myself  you cant just leave me here alone     have a great trip   but it wouldnt turn out to be a great trip at all  hello welcome to shady pines rehab just sign right here  rehab this isnt a spa this isnt a spa   come here wait get her come here mom  we got a runner   as michaels mother was being held against her will  george sr was about to be confronted with a similar problem  kitty howd you find me  i thought you were dead until i saw scandalmakers  they got so much wrong but something about your soninlaws comment  perhaps an attic shall i seek had the ring of truth to it   notice it wasnt something the narrator said   you abandoned me in mexico  kitty honey li know youre mad  stop talking george you stop talking  i am in charge now youre coming with me  no i cant i ca i have a life here  there are people who who depend on me  fine but i cant make any promises  about what happens to that cooler of evidence i have  if i could just have a moment to say goodbye   meanwhile at the banana stand  maeby was hoping to find some witty banter  with which to authenticate her feature film  i want the hot chick to serve me  what other words would you use to describe me   um shes 15 and shes my cousin  so  so you cant touch your cousin my cousin  you know you dont have to stick around  i could just work late tonight it doesnt matter cause my girlfriend shes out of town  shes actually kind of lucky in the end  cause all these guys would be coming on to her  yeah you really dodged a bullet there   nearby phillip litt was making his latest video  everybody gather around gather around ladies heres the deal  we have hats you have breasts  you show your breasts you get a hat okay  so if anyone wants to get back at daddy nows the time   whoo wait cut cut we got a surfboard in the shot  surfboard stop tape  were here to stop you from taking advantage of these girls    you know what youre sassy youre sexy you speak your mind theres nothin hotter   give her a hat barry  i dont want a hat i want you to leave these women alone  im giving them a chance to be idolized  which is an opportunity these women are never gonna have again   i want to be ideolized  yeah you do     eileen stop it youve got nothing to gain from that  thats easy for you to say you already have a hat      come on girls  this is no way to get your daddies to notice you   nearby lindsays own daddy failed to notice her  as he was being taken to a local motel  where he refused kittys sexual advances  you promised me power and a child and i have neither  im gonna take care of this problem on my own  you never promise crazy a baby   george sr was abandoned and longed for lucille  and buster felt the same way   upon her knee   so fine to be  whoohoohoo  mother and boy   restless buster went to the kitchen  to find something to help him sleep   when he came across lucilles emergency stash of wine   motherboy  which he mistook for a giantjuice box  it was the first taste of alcohol buster had since he was nursing   mama  and michael his mother no longer a threat   thank you so much for your understanding sir  met again with cal cullen  as i mentioned on the phone she did seek help    and it was extremely moving when she finally admitted that she has a problem  well take good care of you here at shady pines  ill take care of you you son of a  shady pines is a wonderful facility up there on the hill   you know they used to film sugarfoot up there  no   were you a fan of sugarfoot  i loved it   sugarfoot had been off the air  12 years before michael was born  sing the theme song of sugarfoot along with me   yes  oh what the hell youre a good kid     lets make the deal   oh great ive got papers  michael  remember me perhaps thisll jog your memory    oh theyre crooked  ive kidnapped your father michael  and i have a cooler full of evidence  that will bring down this corrupt company  unless your mother meets me today at 400 at seor tadpoles  spring break whoo   dad   michaels father hadjust been kidnapped     hello  and then he received a call that his brother had been found drunk  no im fine im telling you  for the first time i realize that maybe i am better off without her   yeah well weve gotta bring her back  oh thank god  so if we want to get that evidence back and dad  kitty is insisting on a meeting with mom   what can mom do for her  i dont know ive gotta get my hands on that evidence  problem is i just checked her into rehab  theyre not exactly gonna let me take her to a bar  so gob i need you to help me sneak her past the guards  well gee i didnt think the woman id be checking out at spring break would be mom   shes better looking than the whores you date  dont call my escorts whores   moms still got it  i dont date whores  stop it stop it this objectification of women has to stop   its just mom and whores  no how would you like it  actually thats not a bad idea  i should turn the tables on men and see how they like being objectified   men with low selfesteem get their clothes off  that is a great   that is a great social statement  i shall get the video camera this is ripe for parody  this is ripe  hejust wants to see boyslinuses oh god  here we go   and so michael went back to see his mom   l i know that youre upset with me  because i brought you here under false pretenses   but i really was worried about you  oh please  ive been drinking since before you were born  so if alcohol is the reason im here ive got news for you bub  its the only reason youre here too  hey youre mean sober too  uh listen i need your help  kitty has shown up and she got ahold of dad  she found him in the attic  they had a rerun of scandalmakers last night everybody figured it out  she would like to meet you at a bar  she says shes got some evidence that could bring the business down if you dont go  youre sending me into a bar  are you sure you can trust me to make decisions for myself  i just need you to find out what she wants  while i check all the local motels for dad  all right but heres what i want  a spa weekend with you a real one  i want to spend spring break with you  you have high selfesteem right  not after being in here its a nightmare  michael mom weve gotta go now i created a diversion  youre gonna love this  id like to check my uncle in for rehab  i thought we were buying me some pants  oh of course you think that youre high as a kite  he needs help any he needs help he needs help   and so lucille was able to meet with kitty at seor tadpoles  i want whats due to me a bluth son  and i know you have the material   kitty was right ten years earlier  george sr was taking an experimental hair growth drug  fearing damage to his fertility  he froze a specimen ofhis reproductive material  in case he ever wanted another child  soon news came out that the drug  although somewhat successful  wreaked havoc on the central nervous system  so what do you need me for hes not taking the monkey drug anymore   and youre the one whos got him not me  oh you know why  he wont touch me he said he doesnt cheat on his wife anymore   he said that   drinking contest   he said that   drinking contest  tell you what ill drink you for it  oh i heard you dont handle your booze so well anymore  so this should be easy for you  that one didnt count   and michael met up with gob to try and find their father  i got it from the banana stand freezer  the exact same kind of cooler thats in the photo with dad   what do we need another cooler for  ah poor michael  you do not think like a magician   such a howd he do dat  uhhuh  its a classic bait and switch this is a decoy cooler  we take it in switch it with the one from the photo and get out of there  kitty comes back everythings normal its like we were never there   but dads gone  long gone but it buys us all the time in the world  i got it back mikey the selfconfidence i am a magician  im saying when kitty comes back notices dads gone  first thing shes gonna do is check the cooler see if the evidence is still there  buys us like one second   i am a worthless magician  not true   i cant even do one simple trick  come on   im covered in sweat look at me  its a great trick   wouldve been flawless if you had a decoy dad too  damn it  and i used a guy that looked just like him in my last bait and switch  ow ow ow ow   well im no longer needed here  no no no  i think the coolers actually gonna help us  the extra second that it buys us could be the difference  great just give me a couple of minutes to catch my breath     lucille minutes out of rehab  was engaging in a drinking contest   at the behest ofher son     let me know when youre ready dear   shes mixing  while right outside the bar   i know what the shape of a banana reminds you of  and i know that when i say nuts it makes you giggle     but do you have any other response  to heres a banana with nuts    why are we even going after this idiot demographic  dont you get it theyre not even eating these they just like saying bananas and nuts  and i wont i wont tell you why thats your fathers job  come on lets see some bananas and nuts  oh perhaps we should just pull their pants off  hey what the hell do you think youre doing this is where we shoot  yeah well youve got competition now cause were making our own video  will you just get over it its nudity  just because youre ashamed of your body doesnt mean everybody should be  oh really well lets see how you feel about what youre packing   youre a  nevernude  youre asking girls to take their tops off and you cant even be naked   ive gotta get this  lindsay ive already got it  im back into cutoffs lindsay  i didnt see you at the convention   no i was in germany i teleconferenced in  ohhh   did you go to the seminar on chafing  dr schoenweiss yes  this is never gonna work theres too many people too many rooms  michael we cant give up this is important  believe me id rather be down at the beach having drinks howling at chicks       dad    oh my boys yes you you came for me  yeah hi dad uh gobs gonna get you out of those handcuffs can you do it   one handcuff key coming up  great    what the hell are you doing  swallowed a key just in case i ended up doing a show     come on this is disgusting   im doing this for you   this continued for some time  while michael switched out the coolers   why are you switching out the coolers  it buys us time dad   what like a second  dont worry about it okay  when i get this evidence out of here im turning it right into the court  are you kidding i dont care if the evidence gets out there it gets me off the hook   what are you saying this exonerates you  i told you before  i was a patsy i was set up i am tired of looking guilty  well thats thats great       now whos a horrible magician  that is a crown you horses ass   how does that make you feel  awesome   and george michael caught up with maeby determined to save her selfesteem  look i dont want to ruin your fun but i hate to see guys treat you like this  youre better than that to me anyway youre   awesome  no i was gonna say youre  youre like this flower and i know its springtime  but i just id hate to see you get plucked  by someone who doesnt even care that youre blossoming  thats what ive been waiting to hear   maeby was referring to the dialogue  but george michael hadjust rediscovered his feelings for his cousin  hi ann itsits george michael bluth  um when you get back into town we should talk       can i get you anything else maam  no thanks i have to get back to rehab    shes in rehab        and so george sr was free  and michael and gob absconded with the evidence  one heck of a trick you ended up pullin in there gob  truthfully that wasnt part of the act  i was actually trying to get the key to come out of my mouth  that part was very surprising but im talking about how you helped me get dad out of there  thanks to you this family could end up being okay   and gob had finally overcome his own low selfesteem  hey arent you that magician who always embarrasses himself  not anymore not anymore   gob   but he lost it  along with the exonerating evidence     theyre laughing michael theyre laughing  and thats how you narrate a story  on the next arrested development  lucille gets some disturbing information   did you get the evidence  yes and then gob ruined it  after all the trouble we went through to switch coolers with the one from the banana stand  the one in the freezer i was storing very important things there   and kitty finds what shes been looking for  there was 250 ccs of your father in that banana stand  no touching
