we should circumvrent union penalties   circumverate  circumvent circumvent means to go around  the old reach around  trust me this makes you look like a leader okay  i dont think that i need any help with that   it just leave it where it is   now if you just flip  here are the copies  hey these are these are very small  when you said you wanted photocopies  i thought that you meant you wanted them on a photo printer  tell you what from now on were gonna use just the big printer  okay youre a perfectionist  flashes of quincy   starla claimed to have had a relationship with music legend quincyjones  mr president im gonna go look into some legoland tickets for the weekend   cool lets do it  actually i just meant me and my son  isnt he a little old for that  no sorry ive been looking  to get some alone time with him and it just hasnt seemed to work out lately  no problem ill just call up some of my friends   what  what friends  ive got friends michael i just dont talk to them

could be president again   where is it  mexico  you get the country for free the citythats gonna cost ya     its a 200 fine  oh  i feel like such an   the car is in a town called encanta  if you think

michael had only made him president to stick him with the failing business  while michael himself escaped to mexico to be with his father   so inspired by his mothers private detective    ice  he decided to hire someone to keep an eye on his brother  i think i might have someone whos going to cirsumvrent the law   and michael returned home eager to tell his son of their trip  george michael

bring maeby  you know ive sensed her  feeling a little left out lately   and the next morning the family met at busters sendoff party  where lucille was not keeping her feelings hidden   a camcorder  thats so you can videotape it  when they put you in a naked pyramid and point to your charlie browns  i ought to point to uncle oscars charlie browns  next time youre on top of him mother  hes moving

out youve got to get me out  well im headed down to mexico to find dad  but when i get back maybe well try to figure something out   and thats when buster decided to sneak into mexico to avoid the service  no no i think itll be worked out by then    what was that all about  i think busters gonna escape to mexico  did the secretary not give you the picture for dad i need that to show people there   yeah she brought that over  well this uh is a blueprint  of dads face   she used the big printer ill give her that lets go  not so fast   gob who is that man on the couch  who that guy   hes

home  im gonna have to start putting people in the trunk   in fact at that moment buster was climbing into the trunk  mother when you see this videotape youll know that i left  not out of cowardice but out of  oh man its tiring in here  oh   six minutes later michael dropped offhis mothers housekeeper  mexico   in fact he was in santa ana  a town six minutes inland from his own  but the combination oflosing his glasses and breathing carbon monoxide  had impaired busters judgment  oh this shall keep me safe from the hot mexican sun  excuse me what are you doing   im trying to find a place to live  ay    michael was heading down to mexico  to find his fugitive father  can you believe this this is my trip with my son  and hes too busy whispering secrets to ann to say one word to me   whats that  nothing  were not whispering secrets up here  hey check out whos on that hog in the rearview mirror   george michael  what  twenty miles to legoland     the ice   what have you got  still on his tail about 20 miles from legoland   go get him friend  youre not my friend youre a client   gob realized that perhaps he really didnt have any friends  and lucille sent hers away  buster oscars leaving you win  buster get in trunk of car  so hes not going to the army  he must have had michael sneak him into mexico oh thank god   its better this way mmm  mmm  ill go unpack   heres some money go see a star war     who is it  uh your son   what  i was looking for buster   hes not here  uh what are you doing   i mean do you want to go out  why are you trying to get me out of the house  i just thought that we could hang out   lucille was suspicious that gob was up to some sort of power grab  gene parmesan lucille bluth  my son is trying to get me out of my house   i think he may be up to something    oh hold on thats probably him  gene  its just some idiot with balloons   oh is it   i knew it  i want you to keep an eye on my son gob   and buster was finding himself right at home  oh my god i used to have a shirt just like that   it was busters old shirt lucille had given it to lupe  and the hand chair i had one in my room i wonder where that went   it went right there  i never thought id miss a hand so much  you people are just like me    meanwhile in the real mexico   michael had found the stair car  there it is  and michael set about finding his father  oh yeah sure seor no problem when do you want us to start building  thank you gracias   dad dad  yeah  so what do you think of ann so far  oh ann i just you know i barely know her  you know neither of us do shes just really some girl as far as were concerned right   llim determined to get to know her  yeah   okay  okay i have an idea when we go back  why dont just the two of you go back in the stair car together  well thats no fun  for you you know you guys should be together   oh  or maybe just you and me   if youd rather  yeah   or me and ann  great yes okay  ill tell maeby that ill be going back with her and aunt lindsay great   no no wait lets keep looking for poppop  okay  maybe somebody in the church will know something   in fact george sr was in the church where he was mourned  by his longtime assistant and accomplice to his escape kitty  as only a few days earlier hed been declared dead        but before michael could go inside the church     hey wait a minute wait a minute   i know you youre gobs friend  not friend bounty hunter  gene theres no way youre that good  names ice gob hired me to stop you from fleeing the country  what are you kidding me im not fleeing the country im here looking for my father  but youre obviously better at this kind of thing ill tell you what  im gonna continue paying you to find my father  you can also collect the real bounty on his head  nice deck is this where you saw him last  no this thats actually him   hes just hes much smaller in real life  i can see thats a man  ill find him   lucky  what did he say did he ask about me  i cant believe he followed us all the way to mexico  uh thats a bounty hunter and uh hes on the case so we can all head home  so hes not interested in me  not unless you know where dad is  george michael  oh hi dad yeah they think youre in mexico ill see you when i get home  ye oh yes thank you no i found my birth control pills thanks for asking dad   maeby had had enough ofher mother  and decided to go back with michael  im so sick of her the lame flirting   michael of course thought maeby was referring to ann  i think hes gonna get sick of her before it goes too far  of course he will shes a child  well that that parts not really her fault  i just hate to see him wasting his time you know   lets go ill be in your car  is george michael okay with that   its fine just drive   at no point  were michael and maeby talking about the same person  and there were only four people in their group  and its not a race thing  yeah whoever gets there first   and so michael left with his niece  followed by his sister and his son  followed by the bounty hunter  unfortunately this left the girl michael was determined to get to know alone in mexico  meanwhile buster was adapting to life in what he thought was mexico  but was in fact a town so close to home that they shared a paperboy   i know that guy hey wheres your mother  oh i love this way of life this is where i belong  i love being mexican   we must work now amigo adis  oh no im going with you   i am one of you now ss   and michael on his way back home bonded with maeby  i mean why does everyone have to date anyways  right
