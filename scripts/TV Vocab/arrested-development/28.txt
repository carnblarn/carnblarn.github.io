crane  to retrieve the familyowned frozen banana stand after it had been dumped in the bay  a holiday tradition among the local youth   soon he returned home so that he and his son   george michael  could share their holiday tradition of rebuilding it   another one of dads suits  hey im the president now  im filling dads shoes literally except his shoes dont fit  but i did finally get into dads pants  although i had to have the crotch taken in a little  you know gob maybe its the suits but i think you may be beginning  to alienate some of the employees down at work  what oh thats great  the president has to worry about alienating the employees now   in fact gob had started to alienate some ofhis colleagues  the worst that could happen is i could spill some on my 3000 suit come on   hey  the guy in the 4000 suit  is holding the elevator for the guy who doesnt make that in three months  why dont i just take a whiz through this 5000 suit  come on they like me just fine youll see that tonight  when they toast me at the christmas party just like they used to with dad  they used to roast dad cause they thought that  he had a sense of humor about himself but he didnt and neither do you  hey nobody laughed louder than me at any joke about dad  youre the one whos all mr i take myself too seriously all the time   michael did tend to take the christmas party somewhat seriously  merry christmas you can go ahead and put that right in the charity barrel  thanks a lot sorry pal we just cant have them resent us  i know some of the numbers havent all added up and there is some speculation  that george has been into the kitty     into the kitty thats awesome   fire tom and get your jackass brother out of here  this year im not officially president and itll be nice to actually have some fun  with my son at a christmas party   thank god i dont have to go  so glad to hear you say that  i wanna meet someone there  what so im not invited to the bluth company christmas

and she died  well see things have a way of working themselves out     nonetheless its family first at the holidays   oh god its mom again  put it on speakerphone  i wanna hear her beautiful voice   michael theres a hole in the window theres been a breakin   get over here  im leaving now  sounds tense  that means shes not gettin any from my brother oscar lovely thats nice  i heard about the banana stand and now theres been a breakin  but i have a surprise for whoever it is if he comes back  first i blow him then i poke him  guy has no idea what hes in for  you know mom all the glass seems to be on the outside plus heres your little statue  so i guess what this says to me is i doubt anyone was trying to break in mom  if anything someone was trying to break out where is oscar  well hes on his walkabout or pilgrimage   every year oscar attempts the 420mile walk  from newport beach to berkeley california  in the 12 years hes attempted this  hes never made it past uc irvine  he calls it a quest to recharge his chi i call it an excuse for him  to score his pot and wag his pickle at coeds  you sound mad mom mad enough to throw one of these little lady heads at him   whats that supposed to mean  well maybe youre a little bit lonely  and youre acting out for attention  thats ridiculous i want you to move in with me  what no no no no no no no  didnt you adopt a child for this very reason so that you would never be alone  michael a mother doesnt have a child to give herself company   annyong was to teach buster a lesson  and where is that little lesson  i sent him to the milford academy to teach him a lesson i cant remember about what  and buster left this morning to finish his army training   in fact lucille had refused to drive him to the army base  so buster was taking his very first bus ride   i cant change a hundred  oh  oh god oh   and thats when buster saw something interesting  that could be good for army      whilejust 20 yards away michael went to work repairing the banana stand   what are you doin here  my mom signed me out of school early so she wouldnt have to pick me up later  so she wouldnt be late for the christmas party   thats about the worst thing ive ever heard  i had to drive   because she had a little bit of a buzz on  no thats it   you doing this alone  yeah well thanks  i guess george michaels gettin a little too old to hang out with his dad   yeah and im getting too old for my mom to be with me  you know what   maybe we should go to this party together  really  yeah youre my little niece i think we should be spending more time together   and if it makes my mom jealous  and george michael can run back to his precious ann  great good deal     michael and maeby stopped by the office to see if gob needed help  for the party that was now hours away  king 6300 suit   come on  hi there   whats she doin here  merry christmas to you too uncle gob   everything all right  i just dont want peoples kids getting their sticky

short time later  his mother arrived anything but  someone broke in again the liquor is gone all of it gone   in fact gob had stolen it earlier that day  to cut down on the cost of the party   hey

with me  at you we gotta figure out a way to hire everybody back   a meeting  a party   no we just had a party  yeah but i didnt get to have any fun   so michael went to work on another christmas party  this time with the help ofhis niece   i appreciate you doing this i didnt wanna ask george michael  did you see that he showed up at the party for five minutes and left without saying goodbye   hey my mom doesnt even wanna be in the same room with me  michael  i was almost attacked last night in my own home  i walk in and theres a colored man in my kitchen   colored what color was he exactly  blue  hello lucille     i sent him to your house to keep you safe  well he did a terrible job  didnt he i need someone else someone better what about this one shes got thick arms  mom you just need to calm down a little bit youre so tense  how am i supposed to calm down  sounds tense that means shes not gettin any from my brother oscar   maybe i should move in with you   and michael realized he needed to retrieve his uncle oscar  how would you like to go on a road trip  no i wanna stay here with her lets go   and so the two of them prepared to drive up the coast  youre in charge of the radio and were not stopping until we find uncle oscar  there he is  my mom is very stressed out and she needs something that i cant give her  um maybe a little afternoon delight   oscar thought that michael was referring to a particular brand of cannabis  named afternoon deelite a strain famous for slowing behavior  well sure the question is  which way do i try to get it in her  i dont need any details   maybe ill put it in her brownie  hey   what happened to you  what   oh oh my ears the doctor said i cant go to sleep for five hours  or i might die or something  oh i got blown so i cant sleep   hey

so shes got a new parent  yeah now my dads got a new kid  im gonna lie down for a little bit but just i c i cant fall  hey how would you like to come to the party with me today   and oscar was giving lucille a little afternoon deelite   these are really delicious  ill get some more  okay  mmhmm  where did she go   soon the second bluth company christmas party in as many days began   you are not

be mad at me  cause you didnt think about going out to tarzana  to get the old banana suit out of storage  but its worth it because its time for me to make people laugh again  with me  and whats funnier than a guy in oh hey wait hey     okay     later gob was inside the banana stand  and it was getting pretty hot in there so he decided to lose a layer  hey look theres your mom and george michael i guess they did come to support us after all  look at that theyre all over each other with their little secrets   what can you do right  yeah  how would you feel about singing a little karaoke   unfortunately lindsay wasnt there to see all of michael and maebys song  and was about to have a similar revelation  could not be caught that didnt bite  but you got some bait awaitin and i think i might   try nibbling a little afternoon delight  thats my wife and nephew   skyrockets in flight  we have an open relationship  just then lucille arrived craving a frozen banana  and the effects of lindsay and george michaels afternoon delightwas overshadowed    mom  by the effects of oscar and lucilles afternoon deelite   tobiastobias watch out   tobias couldnt hear    tobias  and didnt manage to get out of the way in time   what the hell was that     and gob couldnt move freely lucille tried to stop  but the car hit gobs banana peel       i cant get out of here im stuck  mom are you crazy you couldve killed somebody  hey mikey relax its just a giant banana   and thats when buster saw an opportunity to be a hero   gob  mom im stuck     i got you brother       and for the second time since he became president  gob heard the sweet sound oflaughter  theyre laughing with me michael theyre laughing with me   unfortunately busters newfound skills  did not involve lowering gently    ooh oh    hey its tobias who wants to take me to the hospital   and so father and son reunited  rebuilding the banana stand for a second time   hey can i give you a hand  hey yeah   that

  yeah well me too  yeah  okay     gonna grab some afternoon  afternoon   it does not seem like it would be that dirty  its it is catchy  right thats the thing   on the next arrested development   the blue man group finally calls for tobias    with a lifechanging opportunity  unfortunately he cant hear it and his life stays the same
