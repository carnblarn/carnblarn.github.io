was making cornballs  a bluth family favorite since  george sr unsuccessfully  tried to market the device in the mid70s  time to pull out the basket  and we dig into some hot   son of a bitch  oh look

looking forward to our ride today we  better go extra hard to work off these cornballs  or you could not eat the cornballs  and let your kid lead his own life  please he loves this am i right  actually uh i cant really go today   hows that  my bike  needs a tuneup or something  lets not blame the bike okay  its the poor carpenter that  blames his shoddy tools for the ow   beeps christ

faster bike  if we werent trying to save every   did you go shopping  oh  yeah dont worry about it   excuse me  i paid for it myself   with what  company credit card   youre returning that  but  get a job    michael hey the cornballer  i thought these things were only legal in mexico  in fact the cornballer  wasnt legal anywhere  but george sr continued to  market it there successfully   muy delicioso  es verdad   continues in spanish   whered you come from  i  had another big fight with marta   gob had been having an  onagain offagain relationship  with marta a  spanishlanguage  soap opera star  it looks like im going to  be staying here for a while  no it doesnt it doesnt look like  that ive got a full house here gob  hes just in a bad mood gob  because his son feels suffocated by him   suffocated really   yes michael hes a teenager  hes probably got a little  girlfriend and well lets face it   you are  overbearing   maybe i should be  more like you when it comes to parenting  no borders no limits go ahead  touch the cornballer you know best  michael if i could stick my pretty  little nose in here for one second  when i was a psychiatrist and  this is before i became an actor   youre still not an actor  lovely  i saw a lot of this type of behavior  and i think what youre  experiencing is your sons very normal need  to distance himself from his overbearing father  am i touching  something hot hot hot hot   be careful  hot  gasping   you all right  hot  now take my daughter for example  she lives her life  and i get the pleasure of  guessing what that might entail  now watch this maeby where are you  off to on this glorious sunday afternoon   she wont tell me  im  going to audition for a play  well that time it didnt work what play  its for high school you cant audition  i was totally wrong  shes reaching out to her actor  daddy does anyone have an ice pack   in truth maeby was  reaching out to a boy named steve holt  who was auditioning for  the lead in the school play  i would kiss before i spoke   maeby decided to audition as well  iooking for a chance to get closer to steve  and then we actually get to kiss right  george michael also chose to audition  iooking for a chance to get  closer to his cousin maeby  i would kiss before i  spoke then theres a kiss right   louder   and  then theres a kiss right    later the cast  list was posted  steve holt   steve holt  standin for steve holt  steve holt   michael went to get his son a  new bike to keep him from slipping away  while michaels mother was giving up hope  her son buster would ever leave her side  zip me up   usually at this time of year  buster would return to his postgraduate studies  but without the resources to afford it  his summer vacation was extending into the fall  mom mom      and  lucille was beginning to resent it    ringing  what   hi mama its linds   cries out  itll fly out on its own why are  you calling me what do you need   scoffs very nice mom i

everybody  you know  the kids gob tobias everybody     he didnt invite buster  busters his brother too  whats wrong with buster   and even as she asked  the question lucille realized  that perhaps it

box in  my office hey  michael  gob what are you doing here  and why are you in a bathrobe  whats he doing here why  is he in his bathing suit  mom dropped me off to spend time with michael  spend

michael  contemplated kissing his rival  michael sought his fathers advice  you think you  never hurt me   what ar  you talking about when have i ever rebelled   i never see you anymore  michael  youre in prison  and i was here yesterday  oh yeah thatsthats im sorry  i couldnt break away from the poker  game capital g was down to his boxers   strip poker  yeah and its tough  we can really only play about two hands  listen  exhales  let him go let your son go  i cant do that dad he needs me  michael you dont want to make the  same mistake your mom made with buster   yeah boy what happened  there  i really dont know  maybe it was the 11 months he spent in the womb  the doctor said there were claw  marks on the walls of her uterus but   deep breath he was our miracle baby you know  and li was just too burned  out on raising you guys to care  so he turned out a little uh soft    loud yawn  a little doughy   i dont know maybemaybe it  was my fault    continues yawning  maybe i just  ignored the guy    grunting  wow were just blowing  through nap time arent we  yeah i gotta let my son go   lindsay  meanwhile still had the dress   and she was starting to get some  positive reactions  to it  look at you  i am  so she decided to hide it  in the attic crawl space   snoring           continues   slams piano cover  are you crazy im a magician  i make my living with my hands   and if im going to be  staying  here  staying here  what did that mexican throw you out  shes not that  mexican mom shes my mexican  and shes colombian or  something anyway its over   youve got three days  hey  if i cant find a horny immigrant by  then i dont deserve to stay here    both laugh  oh   back at the model  home michael was adjusting to  the absence ofhis son by  enjoying the company ofhis brother    grunting  you know  im in pretty good shape  you could be eating my dust all day slowpoke   and buster was  starting to give as good as he got  yeah and you might be eating  beeps     well lets hope it doesnt come  to that     hey tobias hows my son doing  oh well he didnt want to rehearse today  but i do think i have a  handle on what hes going through  i wish i could say the same for steve holt  i dont know what the hell her problem is   her  oh uh im sorry  i say that because i switched the  parts but its still  sighs  off  perhaps if she dressed as a woman   she  oh for the love of  god shes playing a woman  look whos back   im exhausted  neimans again huh  ive been going to the thrift store but  im going to find a way to keep that dress  things didnt work out with mom  it was utterly macabre  zip me up   she always makes  everything  about her   groans  shes the last person i ever  want to need something from  well she likes to be needed just as  long as it doesnt cost her anything  its like she gets off on being withholding  whoa buster   look  whos got something to say   giggles  im mom and i wanna shoot down  everything you say so i feel good about myself    blows giggles  look  whos ragging on the old lady   hey hey  finally  cause im an uptight  long beep  buster   you old horny slut  well no ones gonna top that   and tobias had found the  perfect wardrobe for his leading man  the red dress he  discovered in the attic crawl space   assuming michael had found and  returned it   line ringing   lindsay called her mother hoping  to get money for  a new one  what   hi mama its linds  get a job  look just hear me out its maebys  dress it was stolen from her locker  they beat her up and uh took all her clothes   send her over ill take her  shopping  buster was right  you get off on being withholding dont you   buster said that  thats right   my buster  not anymore apparently   while lucille was  missing her youngest son   michael was finally  enjoying his  company  zip me up  and while buster did build a faster bike  whoo   he  neglected to build the brakes   im flying    buster  and george michael had news for maeby  so i quit the play i dont really like plays  also i think your dad thinks im gay   oh he thinks everyones  gay  do you  wanna get a soda  i cant im actually back in the play  were in the middle of dress rehearsal now   but i thought steve had your  part   steve did  have maebys part  and tobias had given maeby a new part  so you want me to play the man  yes dont you see li cast the parts all wrong  it was daddys fault  and i still get to kiss steve right  its gonna be a huge  disaster ill get you tickets   and michael tried to  salvage what was left of the day   with what was left ofhis  brother  im a  little shaky but   but were here to work  michael   but were here to work  michael   mom  what are you doing here  oh hello buster heres a candy bar   oh  no im withholding it  look at me getting off how  dare you turn buster against me  what are you  talking about    know what youve all been saying  but im not going to let you  destroy my relationship with my son  just because you dont  have one with
