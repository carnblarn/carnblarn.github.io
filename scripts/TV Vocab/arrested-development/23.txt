not a real nose got a picture of her when shes 14 in a swimming cap  she looks like a falcon  spent an entire year living in that stupid model home with those people  and all they did was lie to us   the most recent lie was michaels father had had a heart attack while in prison   we lost him     what the doctor meant to say was that george sr had escaped  a feat hed accomplished by using the familys portable stairway vehicle  id love to see the look on their faces right now    whered he go  or they they think were just headed home  actually you know thats kind of what i thought  until i heard about all that phoenix stuff   michael was concerned that the full impact ofhis departure   might have been lost on his family     hello who is this  yes this is dr blumen  im calling regarding michael bluth   michael phone    they think were still there were goin back     hey mom any messages   none    no there was a message  it was about my health but it doesnt matter   my son and l    buster what are you doing with mothers rape horn  yes i have a rape horn michael because you took away my mace  yeah like anyone would want to r her  this is what im talking about michael  now that your father has deserted us busters become impossible to control  suddenly hes too much of a big shot to brush mothers hair  well im not he  im not helping you with buster anymore  im not helping

somebody else i hope she doesnt kill you  ill kill her first  and good luck trying to find someone else to run the business by the way  gob instead of always coming to me asking me for money  saying ive made a huge mistake  you can bail yourself out next time  ive never admitted to a mistake what would i have made a mistake about  lindsay instead of sleeping in twin beds you and your husband take the master bedroom  its not like youve never come to me with your marital problems  saying oh help me michael i think my husband might be a     ohh    well its   here we go   and so once again the guys were on their way to phoenix never to look back   its just the lab calling  well give him the bad news in phoenix   they know were gone  great  you did say phoenix again but what do we care  sorry  now do you want to steer or are you too old to sit on your pops lap and drive  i think i might be  okay    cars registered to george bluth so we had to check   but hes been caught so youre free to go  hes been caught   michael knew ifhe went back to see his father  he would only end up saying something hurtful  were goin back   in fact the police only thought theyd arrested george sr  do you have any cookies with no preservatives   but had gotten his twin brother oscar instead   oscar a tall tea for oscar  yeah  oh good grief its oscar  oh thank god youve come    lucille had a relationship with oscar years earlier   which she was not eager to rekindle  what is wrong with you   the boy is here  oh   they said my father was here  did they   lets get out of here  whatwhat about oscar  yes they impounded my uh my humble trailer   youll stay with us  no he wont  youre the one who says i need a father figure  yes a father figure  fine but youre not sleeping in my bed   okay  okay yeah   soon michael arrived to claim his father  and was met by the family attorney barry zuckerkorn   hmm  no i know i know i know  everybody says leave it alone leave it alone  does this look contagious to you hey kiddo  all right it wasnt your father  it was your uncle i ran into them as they were leaving  there he is got ya   oh for gods sake   yeah  i only came back to tell him i was leaving so i guess its time to go son   where you going  we cant tell you  no no we can tell barry were going to phoenix  oh i wish you hadnt have said that  as your lawyer i have to inform you you cannot leave the state  with your father gone they want to hold you   mme  theyre going to indict you tomorrow  all you have to do is come up with the bail take it out of the business  but l i cant i quit i dont want to follow in my fathers footsteps  then you might wind up on his cot  oh man i wish you hadnt said phoenix wow   michael hadjust found out he couldnt leave the state   michael hadjust found out he couldnt leave the state  unless he came up with bail  okay listen im gonna get the company checkbook and dont tell the family  we cant give them the satisfaction of telling them that i need money okay   do you remember what we say about the family  its not aunt lindsays nose  yes but no  dont dont tell them that we were goin to   we say we dont need them hmm  oh yeah okay  the new one i didnt   it comes from knowing youre toned and fit   what are you doing  im exercising michael  i see you found an exercise tape made for people as lazy as you are   i do have a love life  tighten one two three  okay this is going off  one night in the master bedroom and you got yourself a love life again  well ill be honest at first it was awkward   together two three four   release two three four  oh lindsay     uh well this is exciting   finally we can be a normal couple  nice to be back in a queen   its too much pressure  i cant do this   so lindsay and tobias finally took a hard look at their relationship  you know lindsay as a therapist i have advised a number of couples  to explore an open relationship  wherewhere the couple remains emotionally committed  but free to explore extramarital encounters   did it work for those people  no it never does  these people somehow delude themselves into thinking it might but  but it might work for us   we could give it a shot  great well hammer out the details later  right now weve got a daughter to tell  maeby were having a family meeting    on her way to the family meeting  family meeting   lindsay had an unexpected encounter  hello  oh hi gob told me to come by  well uh i dont think hes here  well tell him i like what i see  and we probably wont even act on it were not gonna get a divorce  if anything itll bring mommy and daddy closer together  i met someone ive got a date  im dating someone  well let the great experiment begin   youre not using my master bedroom for that  i believe you left  or did you realize how much you need us after all   actually i came back because i need something  hmm  some things like the checkbook wheres the corporate checkbook  gob mustve taken it to the office  mom put him in charge thats right michael hes got your oldjob  well i better get over there before he brings the whole company down  its only been three hours how much damage could he really do  and release   in three hours gob had done 45000 in damage  in there please  hey wheres my desk  oh i think its the massage table in the break room now   take the window  no hold it  gob mom may think that shes given you my job  but the board still has to approve that decision   actually they already have  why should we believe in you  for the same reason you should believe that a hundreddollar bill  is no more than a hundred pennies     they approved me unanimously  why wouldnt they youve only lost them 99 so far  ive already been pretty successful  showing the model house again sent a realtor over there yesterday   it was this realtor whod run into lindsay thinking she was looking for a home  i have an open thing goin on too ill give you the address and you can come by  and i think youll really like the neighbors  okay  so what brings you here i hope its not for a handout  i run a pretty tight ship around here   with a pool table  its a gaming ship  im here because i thought you might need me   i need you  thats right  oh boy thats good  cant wait to call the guys in to hear this one  listen how do you intercom on this   star two  yeah at the same time  yeah just no the star in the corner the star   so if i do it like that  no turn it around the other way star   oh that star  lets just hang it up there we go  li thought that you might need me to help you with the books  you know the corporate checkbook where is it  actually moms got it she wasnt comfortable with me   michael now had the distasteful choice  of either asking his mother for money or going tojail  maybe buster killed her already   tobias was also having a bad day  lindsay had met someone and he hadnt  and thats when he found what he thought was a support group for depressed men  well if it isnt the boy who cried phoenix  ohh no i was just uh just worried about buster  i thought maybe i should give him a little guidance  write him a check be a role model wheres the company checkbook  i already have a new role model michael   his uncle oscar is living here now  wow  you guys have accomplished a lot in the last three hours   where is he  i sent him out for a new air horn          yeah   weve got it all under control  great  im just worried that its only gonna be a matter of time  before the media starts putting together all the pieces of this iraq story   michael had recently found out that the model home  he and his son currently lived in  was very similar to some his father may have illegally been building in iraq  they havent yet and frankly its a very difficult charge to prove  man that jurys gonna fall in love with you   what do you need michael  i dont need anything  im great cause everyone else is great  i cant tell you how nice it is to not be needed anymore   i want you  okay the jury might actually like that   it was at that moment that gob found something thejury might not like  hammer oops   and lindsay arrived at what she thought was a date  hey you found it  so shall we start in the kitchen   i thought the bedroom  sure  ill meet you up there i gotta make this place smell like cookies  and you should know i am anticipating multiples on this  well i wouldnt be doing this if i didnt think that was a possibility   lindsay was nervous and took a shower to relax  i cant do this im not ready for this   come on kids well go downstairs and have some cookies   the kids were in for some bad news too  tobias meanwhile discovered that what he thought was a support group  turned out to be a team ofbald men painted blue  even lucille was about to find herself in trouble   oh youve done this before    you know you should let your hair grow long  yeah ive thought about it i guess id look like you     more than youll ever know  are you living in one of saddams many palaces  they may have been built by the same developer  and a seal attack meet one surprised bather coming up     seven minutes had passed since gob had discovered the document   gob your mother on line one  im coming over dont talk to anyone  it was at that moment that lucille was stopped by a documentary filmmaker  uh your companys being accused of profiting off the building of houses in iraq  thats crazy were all loyal americans  oh yeah would you enlist your son or daughter in the army  yes   michael was out of options  and knowing that his father had a penchant for hiding valuable things in walls  considered one last desperate gambit  this is crazy what am i doing using a hammer to try to        are you crazy  are you blue  only in color michael only in color  it seems i might have stumbled upon an acting opportunity  as a member of the blue man group  oh no youre thinking of the support group  i made that same mistake myself theyre called the blue man group  but its funny if i hadnt sought out a support group  i never wouldve gotten this gig as an understudy for a performance art group    you know the universe works in mysterious ways michael  you never know where help is going to come from until you look for it  why does everybody think that i need help   michael look at you  i mean youre holding a sledgehammer your shirt is cov oh i did that  um here let me uhwell   and michael realized that he too had been too proud   i need money  i cant help you  i know it did bother me that they did so well without me  but li do have to ask them for help  and i have to ask for an audition  you havent auditioned yet  oh no no im not in the group yet  no im afraid i just blue myself  theres gotta be a better way to say that   tobias rushed to the theater hoping to be seen  unfortunately it was dusk and he couldnt be seen     what the hell was that   so for the second time in two days the family gathered at the hospital  everythings gonna be okay im sure hes gonna be fine  im so sorry that this happened i spoke to him just before he left the house   oh really what was the last thing he said  i just blue myself  he said some wonderful things  including the fact that sometimes people  are too proud to ask for help when they need it   oh god fine i need you  i need you okay michael  no li didnt mean for  he was a realtor michael now my husbands in the hospital  mom volunteered me for the army just because the fat man dared her to   we cant let them take buster  i lost my wig my uncle sam wig  michael i am sitting on some very hot information here  i know too much ive got the thingy  half in english half in scribbly  michael please we need you  well i hate to cancel my medical followup in phoenix  but you give me the corporate checkbook ill see what i can do  excuse me mrs fnke   oh this guy again  how is he doctor  it uh looks like hes dead   oh my god   oh little guy   the tears arent coming the tears just arent coming  okay okay  uh just to be clear   looks like hes dead or he is dead  it just looks like hes dead  hes got like blue paint on him or something but hes going to be fine   what is wrong with you   what a  doctor   ill let you celebrate privately  hey we want this comped  well im gonna im just gonna head out  you dont need some uh piece of  uncle hanging around  hey hey thats not my dad thats not the guy you want if you want anybody its me    what   michael  yeah i gotta turn myself in or make bail  uh maybe by like 800  hey hey hey thats enough  whoa hey you might want to have that looked at  thanks mikey   they think im involved in this iraq thing  and i cant prove that im not with dad not around  so i need your help or im gonna go to jail  weve got the proof michael dad signed a contract with saddam   hussein  use it  if it makes your father look bad then so be it hes long gone now   hey uh wheres the briefcase  oscar has it  hey im awfully sorry im late  i got here as fast as l oh how is he  did you just change your clothes  hey look what i found on windowsill  just hat someone take wig   in fact it was george sr who took wig   hit it  and was fleeing the country with the evidence  michael so badly needed  you made a huge mistake   on the next arrested development   lindsay almost stumbles upon a dating opportunity  you look really hot  but instead is admitted to the hospital with a fever of 104  michael finally gets the corporate checkbook  only to find that the family has gotten to it first  and barry lands in jail  youre glad tobias is pressing charges  i am having the time of my life   hey  hey dr hate   no touching
