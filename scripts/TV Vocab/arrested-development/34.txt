so is this one   michael found this out after having lindsay and tobias  break into maggies house and hide in the bathroom  to collect and test her urine   it was there that they stumbled upon a fat

ocean   where he was attacked by a loose seal    if only your father was here   oh that george god only knows where he is  the car   up yours granny  you couldnt handle it   in fact george sr had

son the juice  buster its okay doctor says youre gonna be fine  and if they can find the hand theyre gonna be able to reattach it   you know like a transplant  im fine  this is a blessing and speaking of blessings i heard theres gonna be a baby     oh yeah yeah but please dont worry about that  whats more important is that youre really doin well with this pal  my hat is off to you  and my hand is off to you       no no i meant dont get your hopes up about that   hand transplant    no the uh baby the mother doesnt want me around  we kind of had a little bit of a fight   you obviously care about this maggie woman dont you  yes i do of course i do  i mean a seal didnt bite your linus off did it   no a seal didnt bite my linus off  good   then go to her ask for her hand  yeah  and uh maybe  ill get one for my brother while im at it   yeah get him out of here     hmm  get him out of here  get the  out of my room   oh my god buster  oh my god   buster whats wrong nurse     so at his brothers suggestion  michael went to the courthouse determined to win maggie back   have you seen maggie its kind of important  oh you just missed her  shes in the bar what a spanking i gave her in court today   go get em  he spanked me   did you spank her  no  you know that waitress shes representing is suing my client for making her fat  but heres the thing loretta is not fat  maggie bought her a fat suit and ive got the receipt to prove it  of course thats what the fat suit is for  well ive gotta find her i owe her an apology you said shes at a bar  friday night you might want to try miss temples tell her barry said     ooh i did good today   and michael caught up with maggie  you know there have been lies yes  but its not like either one of us would ever do anything to hurt the other person  hello officers  well theres no further sign of a breakin at your house  and since you havent called us back we again left the number in case theres a problem   thanks officer taylor  just next time uh call us back  hey the breakin i told you that was us  well maybe i did want to hurt you because i was hurt   the only reason youre here is out of loyalty to the baby  its not just about the baby  maggie there was a reason that you and i got together in the first place  when we made this baby okay  theres something here as long as we never lie to each other again  well then i have to come clean about one more thing   oh no  youre not the father  come on  i went to a sperm bank okay the week before we even met  the fathers some guy from harvard but thats all i know  thats great hes probably some geek simpsons writers kid  i never thought id meet someone like you   mmm  but come on  i mean do you still really want me  are you really that great of a guy   michael had always thought ofhimself as that great a guy   the kind of guy who could raise someone elses baby  of course i am   but he wasnt   and he regretted it the moment he said it     the next day the family gathered to welcome buster home from the hospital  hes coming what hes wearing is temporary  please dont comment on it or salute him like that idiot guard down there did to him  well look whos back   lets all say hello  hi  and while youre at it lets all give me a big hand    george michael get your uncle a bandage for his forehead  and while youre at it uh get two  oh my god  guess this means you dont wanna play got your nose with me    oh whats the matter buster   did you hurt yourself  uh hi gob  oh my god whatwhat happened to your hes got no hand  buster went swimming in the ocean  and according to him a seal with a bow tie bit off his hand  bow tie  its merely the playful mutterings of the shock victim  a seal would never prey on a human  unless of course it had acquired a taste for mammal blood   gob had recently dressed a seal in a bow tie  and used him in a magic trick   when it failed he released the seal into the ocean    youre back in the real world youre not gonna be handfed anymore  how the hell would a seal know how to tie a bow tie anyway   i can barely tie the yellow one that i wear in my act  this one had a yellow bow tie  really   and later lucille could not contain her guilt any longer  i did this i prayed that god take anything he wanted from us  so that buster wouldnt have to go to war  oh mom after all these years gods not gonna take a call from you   i did this  i think that the seal with the yellow bow tie might be the one  that i released into the sea after giving it the taste for mammal blood  okay youve got a better case than mom does  still i could hunt down that seal  they said if you retrieve busters hand they might be able to do a transplant  at the very least i can remove that incriminating bow tie   and michael told lindsay about his commitment to maggie  and the child that wasnt his  well first of all im sure there are writers on the simpsons who arent geeks  and secondly i think this commitment youre making is great  it is its great its great  i do think something might be up though what if shes still lying  oh no youre trying to get out of this arent you   li thought you were a good guy  i am a good guy   is he trying to get out of having this baby  we want this child  its given us a reason to stay together   in fact it was investigating the pregnancy  that had reignited lindsay and tobiass passion  it was weird   wheres your child  i dont have a child michael   we dont have a child michael  thats why we want    oh  did you mean maeby   i did mean maeby  well shes hardly a child is she michael  yeah and we know where she is  shes with her debate club and theyre on their way to sacremende for the semifinals   she wasnt  and a google search of the word sacremendeonly came up with this  in fact she was overseeing a remake ofthe old man and the sea  for the film studio where shed bluffed her way into a job  what on earth is taking so long  am i the only one who wants to get home and see their kids  so please dont tell me i dont know where my kid is  all im saying is that maggie claims that no one else is involved  but what if shes lying again and there is someone else involved  you know a boyfriend a husband  someone that got dumped when something better came along   of course why wouldnt she  im a good guy you know  so im thinkin maybe you can break into her house again for me  and see if you can find some uh  way out of this for you i dont think so  no i was gonna say find some evidence of who the father is but forget it  ill find somebody who wants an adventure   george michael how would you like to get away from uncle buster   id really like that  good shh shh shh   and so with his sons help michael went to maggies  to find some evidence of another man  its another bluth boy adventure were like a team   were like red mcgibbon and bullet  who  theyre this old uh never mind okay listen  anything you find in therename phone numberyou bring it out to daddy all right   you mean youre not going in with me  hmm no  i cant fit through that doggy door  but i am gonna risk being caught out here be careful  okay i got a phone number lets go drive   lets go hit the gas  you didnt even go inside   it was taped to the door  its probably the sparkletts guy  listen its okay im telling you theres nothing to be scared about  im not getting that vibe hey   everything all right  yes officer   just waiting to see if maggies home  oh  i was making sure there wasnt another breakin  my partner is inside with his gun drawn  everythings gonna be just fine  close call there bullet im so sorry about that  but listen i think i think that you do have something here with this phone number  really eager to hear from you  you know thats something a guy would say if he was the father of her child  and the mother stopped calling cause she found a really good guy  i think this is him im gettin that vibe were havin some fun arent we  im really sorry about that   gob arrived at the dock hoping to recover his brothers missing hand   im lookin for the seal thats got the taste for kitty blood     ill pay you handsomely     in fact the skipper had already rented his boat to be shot in maebys film   so neither he nor gob were prepared     for the challenges of using cats to catch a seal     god its like herding cats    heres your kitty cat aah fine  you dont get to be bait  why are there cats in the shot  this is the camera boat can you lose the  cats please  uncle gob  maeby   and michael traced the phone number he found on the note to an address  thank you mr parmesan okay  in there is the father of the child that maggie wants me to help her raise  and he probably doesnt know that shes got another man involved  so i want you to stay here and enjoy the adventure from the car  this one could get a little ugly  and hey id like to see that cop of maggies do detective work this good huh       oh come on is this your phone number  hey i told you at the bar i left that on maggies door  and why are you hangin around maggies house anyway  l im sorry im in this crazy relationship  she wants me to raise this child with her because theres no father   no father  i thought id come here  theres a father theres two fathers david   im making gravy  that bitch is gonna keep our child   i knew she was up to something  hot cops  hot   michael had tracked down the couple whod hired maggie to carry their child   so thats why you guys are staking out her house  she hasnt returned our calls   theres something about her i just dont trust  ill say  she said she doesnt know who the father is  in a funny way neither do we wejust gave her a mixed cocktail   two parts taylor  two parts carter  and let her do her thing  we decided we never want to know which of us is the real father  well why should you  i just hope you find out which one of you can breastfeed   you know were in a loving relationship  andjust because we dont have breasts does not mean we cannot nourish our child  im sorry i didnt mean to  i dont want you guys to worry about getting that child back from maggie  because im gonna help you  wow what a good guy  i know and for once im one lie ahead of maggie lizers lies   in fact michael was one lie behind her  and what if i told you that loretta was not fat  but actually a very greedy woman  in a very cheap fat suit  what do you think im kidding huh   what are you doing  okay so shes fat   your honor this is an outrage  wow did i lose this one  mr zuckerkorn youve been warned about touching   you said spanking  i want this case thrown out immediately      in fact loretta wasnt overweight    oh no my water just broke  quickly your honor quickly throw it out   but was carrying the child that maggie was supposed to  you see it was lorettas urine that tobias and lindsay ended up testing  a fact they missed when they were making out in the shower  and maggie did buy the fat suit to serve as her pregnancy belly  all right this is goin back   but soon upgraded to a higherquality latex model   its time   is there a doctor in the house  oh my god my water broke too  im in labor   maggie wasnt but had no choice but to pretend to deliver at the same time  and gob caught up with maeby and made a confession  i think im responsible for busters hand  yeah and im responsible for an 80million movie without an ending  i know those problems seem big when youre a kid maeby  look this is kind of weird advice for me to be giving  but why dont you just tell him the truth  i mean hell respect you for it  thanks maeby  okay now im just lying for no reason   and michael arrived at the courthouse  only to discover that maggie had already been rushed to the hospital  and back at the penthouse lucille was praying for the second time in her life  lord let buster forget everything  and if you need to take another hand to make that happen  please make it gobs   it was at that exact moment that buster did forget hed lost his hand  oh no stop it stop it stop it  oh you caught my tendon in your claw  my claw aw god   im a monster    no    whose idea was the temporary hand  buster  hi theres something you need to know  theres nothing he needs to know take his hand take it now  it was my fault it was my seal  i released him and he bit off your hand  wow truth feels good    you did this to me  yeah   and gob was about to experience something that didnt feel that good     no buster oh  michael meanwhile notified the policemen that maggie was in the hospital   i will meet you there  were on our way  im getting goose bumps  hi okay im gonna go in

is over  no more lying no deceit no sex everything  no more lies   but that too turned out to be a lie  on the next arrested development  buster and gob find themselves closer than ever  and there you
