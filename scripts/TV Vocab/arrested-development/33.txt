                now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything  and the one son who had no choice  but to keep them all together  its arrested development   michael was having brunch with sally sitwell  i still cant believe we got in this place is usually so packed on sundays   in addition to its sunday popularity  the bistro was also famous for something called the skips scramble   an egg dish that contained everything on the menu  dont order the skips scramble  just more good luck everythings been going so well since we started goinout  i think weve actually gone out eight times now   which included a recordtying  three lovemaking sessions in one night for michael   yes  just think  how different everything in our lives would be if wed gotten together in high school  of course i wouldnt have had george michael  we probably wouldve had an entirely different kind of child    i really hope hes okay with us goin out  were very close we dont keep anything from each other  oh no its my dad im supposed to be at work  you know george michael you worry too much  its sunday youre allowed to have a couple of hours off  you dont see me nervous about being on my third virgin mary  why would you be nervous theres no alcohol in a virgin mary  there isnt this is unbelievable  can i get a virgin pia colada when you get a chance  now well get things started  hi this is so uh  i was just   hey okay  i want to introduce you to sally this is george michael   my niece maeby  its nice to meet you  i just shut down the banana stand for a half an hour   i can keep it open late tonight if you  no hey come on  make me sound like a taskmaster  but if if you want to keep it open an extra hour you know  so this is sally   is she your girlfriend  no   yes  a little  you know what im gonna meet you in a few minutes okay   okay  and maybe well work on breaking that record huh  okay  shes a shotputter and im dating her  but i just want to make sure that youre comfortable with everything  well of course we could doubledate you and sally and me and ann   who  wann   yes yes  yeah we had  of course i know ann yeah see i didnt mean who  i meant uh her thats a great idea   i love ann  great  excuse me maam  george michael you said that you couldnt come to church  because you were working and now youre doing neither  thats quite a lot of sins for a sunday afternoon dont you think   your virgin pia colada  and now youre drinking  no were just having a little fun you know  i think the church and studying are fun   i thought you felt the same  well i do  l i like not having fun  i like your idea of fun i mean  our idea of fun i like not having that  im going back to church  well she just killed my buzz  so youre still enjoying this relationship  i mean i guess weve lost some of the heat since we have kissed  i mean how do you relight that fire  but i cant break up with her i always assumed she would break up with me  well we may have to find a way to speed that process up   and later that day michael caught lindsay up  on the emotional bond he was forming with sally  oh big deal three times ive had three times plenty of times  yes  did you call my name  absolutely not  i just hope that george michael is really okay with it  i think youre looking for a reason this isnt going to work  because you cant handle happiness and you like to suffer  oh how delicious  oh hey lets not spin in the comfy chair  look at this delicious piece of irony im being sued for divorce   me  thought you were single  yeah i keep forgetting that i got married   gob met a woman one night  and after a series of escalating dares married her  yes but its all coming back to me now  she was a seal dealer  she raised and sold seals to aquariums and marine parks that sort of thing  then she went off to fight her war and left me to look after them   it was while in the service that her penchant for daring  found a natural outlet  ive never known you to look after a seal  turns out its a major hassle tried to include one in my act once  theres a reason you dont typically see live seals in a magic show   so with a simple wave of my     oh lookit over there    well one of the desperate housewives looking so desperate    so i released them from whence they came and now shes stomping on my heart   whats her first name quickly  krindy  names not krindy gob  ah saul zentsman no thats her lawyer  well shes got a name and im gonna find out what it is  and then im gonna make a pun on it and thats what ill call her  bad example if her names amy ill call her blamy  thats a strong defense ill tell you what  ill help you look for barry tomorrow i think dad prepaid him  for lindsay and tobiass divorce anyway  look at us three relationships all falling apart  maybe its time we actually took some responsibility for that   i think its moms fault  i was gonna say the exact same thing     no thats not a spinner  so this is how my children speak of me when im not here   what are you doin here mom  your brother buster  wants to meet me at the beach tomorrow  do you know what this is about because if its about going in the ocean  the answer is no hes not going in the ocean  well there are bigger dangers mom  like say signing him up for the army during wartime  what the hell was i supposed to do  michael moore confronted me in front of the whole country  first of all it wasnt michael moore it was a lookalike  and it wasnt in front of the whole country  it was for a bit on jimmy kimmel live  i dont know who that is and i dont care to find out   but the next day she did find out what buster wanted  okay i think we have enough of you two kissing  oh i cant believe you hired a photographer  we havent done this since the balboa bay window magazine  so i wanted you to have a recent picture of me  because they want to ship me out tomorrow with army  what to where  iraq and i just might be out of options  i dont want to go but they keep  i know what this is about you want to go swimming in the ocean  well you can forget it   i dont think thats what this is about  yes it is  hes trying to punish me or something   whatever happened to keepin it fresh  i was 30 years old then mother  im 32 now and im not trying to teach you a lesson  well i may not have been a perfect mother  but you know kids dont come with a handbook   in fact there are thousands ofbooks written on childrearing  but lucille was in denial  if he wants to go swimming let him   and buster was far from ready to go swimming in the ocean     and later michael and gob tracked down their attorney   barry zuckerkorn  thank you so much for coming down here  ive got a big case im representing skip churchs restaurant   i dont care  a waitress that works there is claiming  that by eating skips scramble several times a week is making her a fatty  we need to speak to you about getting a divorce for gob   oh well i got michael out of his marriage didnt i  actually she died   youre kidding ive been taking credit for that for years  credit   whos their lawyer  saul zentsman do you know him  i have chinese with him every friday night at miss temples   hes tough  i just want my wife back  save it for the stand okay tom jane  fine ill get into this as soon as i lose this case  you know whos defending the fatty maggie lizer  maggie lizer our old prosecutor   michael had an affair with maggie lizer  while she was both pretending to be blind and prosecuting the family  it was with her hed first set the threetime record  yes   their relationship ended somewhat abruptly   wow how does she look  well shes get  if you ask me bigger    she was bigger   are you sure youre okay to go on  because she was pregnant  its not my belly we have to worry about your honor  its lorettas  being tempted day in and day out by those skips scrambles  bring em in boys   oh im cooked they love her  tell you the truth i preferred it when she was blind   and so michael caught up with his onetime lover  how you doin wow you look fantastic  wow havent seen you since we had an affair and you ruined my career  yeah i was gonna call you a couple of times and then i just  i got to thinking uh what if she brings that up  to tell you the truth i am so relieved not to be pretending to be blind anymore  its actually taught me not to rely on cheap tricks to get the jurys sympathy  im sorry i know im not supposed to do this  but we just spend so much time in that box   i knitted you something   oh juror number four  gosh thank you i feel so bad i fought so hard to keep you off the jury   oh  ms lizer can i see you in my chambers  oh yes your honor   in fact judge ping had a gift for maggie too  an oceansounds toddler rocker hed asked his bailiff to assemble  too bad the trials not going longer she couldve knit you something that fit  i know im so big now  no no come on they look great  you look great you look fantastic  last time i saw you was in that jury box right there wasnt it   wasnt it like a year ago  oh chip you know what  can you take this back to my house    actually its been about eight and a half months  eight and a half months huh wow  i see somebody has been counting the uh  eight and a half months wow really couldve sworn it was a year   michael hadjust learned  that the woman hed been intimate with eight and a half months earlier  was eightandahalf months pregnant   didnt i use something  no  you thought i was blind remember   dont worry youre not the father michael     no problem  really   right  you sure i mean uh  i could be what if i was dont you want to discuss this maybe  michael i havent heard from you  l i really dont want to hear from you now  listen if youre interested come to the baptism  you can hurl a bible at the baby   and that night michael met up with sally  where he felt he needed to be honest with her  sally  you need to know about my child  george michael he approves  no there may be another child in the mix  i ran into an ex we had a very messed up relationship  it was based totally on lies but shes pregnant  she said something that led me to believe that it might be mine   but you said she was a liar  shshe is  she said it wasnt mine so   why are you telling me this  well because obviously  if it is my child im gonna have to be responsible for it  and thats going to make things awfully complicated for us  michael you know what youre always looking for things to get between us  first it was whats your son gonna think  and now you think youre having a baby  because a woman who lies told you you werent  thats a great way to say that we really do communicate well do you know that  are you insane you broke up with her because  somebody who doesnt want you might be pregnant with your baby  no sally broke up with me and as for maggie  i didnt even know that she was pregnant when i first saw her  all i could see was her giant chest box  she had this some people call it a chest i call it a box  she was holding this giant box maybe i shouldve just stayed out of it  she did make it pretty clear that she doesnt want me around  come on michael shes probably not even pregnant  you said she was carrying a big box  pregnant women tend not to do that  it did say 60 pounds on it  okay live done this wrong  i shouldve found out whether it was a real pregnancy before i told my dream girl about it   you know what i do mike check their urine  make em pee in a cup and pee in a cup right in front of me  yeah well thanks gob but uh i think we should just keep on lookin  i dont know how i can make that sound like me  so you get someone to break into her house rig the toilet  collect the pee test it and expose the lie  i mean id do it but im goin through a divorce here guy  oh a pregnancy test   theres something we never had huh lindsay oh no  we had to create our little frankenstein monster  out of science and money and just a dash of  maeby what hhow long have you been standing there   i just walked in  just walked in   seems like only yesterday you were bursting forth from your mothers fertile womb   you know what tobias and i will break into her house and get the specimen   weve been looking for a little excitement   yeah   itll be fun we will be like tracy and hepburn     what do you say you old poop  oh god hes hepburn  i am done with buster  he pushes my buttons thats all he does  he also zips you up and sands your elbows  not anymore no no no hes pretending hes going to war  mr big shot god knows what hes really doing  wait a minute he said hes going to war arent you worried  oh youre sounding like your uncle  and ive had enough of his attitude too   the boy is going to war youre gonna have to face that  its none of your business  he is my boy   i need macaroons  oh youre high  oh well you can win every argument like that but that does not make you right  i dont want you telling him youre his father i need ice  cant you see youre in denial   youre high  youre drunk   where did buster say he was going  iraq  which is a shot at your father thank god hes not here to hear this     excuse me one second   its the pipes  you know mother lucille  theres a psychological concept  known as denial that i believe youre evincing  its when a thought is so hateful  that the mind literally rejects it  you are a worse psychiatrist than you are a soninlaw  and you will never get work as an actor  because you have no talent  well if shes not going to say anything i certainly cant help her   and maeby saw a way to help her cousin  i know how to get rid of ann you put her in a room with gangy   shell criticize her away  but what would gangy have to criticize about ann  oh george michael   in the attic michael met with george sr   whod overheard about buster  he cant go you cant let him  i command you  i really hate it when you put on the god costume   george sr had always worn the god costume  at the annual living classics pageant  where he and buster recreated michelangelos the creation of adam  what if i never get a chance to reach out and touch that hand of his again   i gotta go to him  pop youre a wanted man  you cannot risk leaving the attic all the time  oh when when have i ever left the attic  two days ago right saw you floating around the ford dealership  yeah well have you seen the new ford mustang  you could hump that hood   and michael set the plan in motion to get   maggie out ofher house  hi maggie   are you blind again  for the pizza guy  i give him a five i tell him to keep the change  what are you doin here michael im with a client   is that the pizza  no  youll get your pizza  shes taking the stand tomorrow i want to make sure it creaks  theres so much i dont understand about the law  look maggie if this child is mine i really need to know  so can you spare a few minutes for someone who might be the father of your baby  of course i can   okay  but its not you  oh for gods sakes  oh come on   fine let me get miss fat ass outta here   and ill meet you in the car  okay   meanwhile on the other side of maggies house  lindsay and tobias were putting their plan into action   im cloaking myself in her scent  oh shes not blind  well she was when she bought this        oh my god thats her  get in the tub   buster meanwhile received an unexpected visitor  i want you to know that its okay for you to hide  a man can hide theres a quiet courage in that  youre a good uncle  im not your uncle im your father   what  shh shh quiet courage  quiet courage hide   but buster was confused  you lied to me uncle oscars my father  he just told me so and maybe youre not even my real mother  for all i know lucille 2 is my real mother oh  buster you were never supposed to know  oh yeah well heres something you should know im going to war   buster hadjust discovered hed been lied to by his parents  im going to war   you told him you were his father  i did no such thing   youre high  youre drunk   george  he mustve come here to say goodbye to buster   and thats when lucille snapped out ofher denial  my babys going to war   lindsay and tobias were gathering evidence  that maggie was truly pregnant  and they were having fun doing it  thats the first time we were in the shower since our honeymoon  and this time no tears  tobias this is the box that michael was talking about 60 pounds    but it didnt weigh 60 pounds    michael was stalling maggie and they were also having fun  sally sitwell you know i think i had her little play oven  yeah i know its a funny name but shes a doll   yeah i had one    if you pull her hair shed cry or something  this one kinda does that too   hello  we got the pee and were gonna get it checked  but listen you should know that that box that says 60 pounds  its actually like two pounds  i think shes pregnant michael i mean theres baby stuff here and   tobias stop it thats for the baby its not   were having a really good time  yeah   well i kind of am too  bye  so no more lies tell me the truth  iflf that baby is mine maybe were meant to be together  of course it is michael   but thats when the fnkes discovered what was in the box  that was so easy to lift   thats what it is  okay the box was light cause it had a fake stomach in it  it looks like shes faking it oh god i hope you get this  wait up please   and george michael and maeby brought ann to the penthouse  in hopes that lucille would drive her away  isnt ann great   oh shes lovely   unfortunately  she was distracted by the thought oflosing buster  hey do you have any bread pudding  cause youd be surprised how much this one can put away   ha  now that busters not here theres no one to finish it  i dont care if i ever eat again  you know when times are tough  you can always turn to the power of prayer  here we go   show me     this was a big get for god  and michael brought maggie home to meet his son  this is gonna be easy hes been signing off on everyone lately maybe he called     hey so whats the deal on zuckerkorn  cause you know my fat case its really pretty thin   lying untrustworthy  yeah  plus i heard he hangs out at rest stops  no no im talkin about you maggie  i dont know why im surprised i shouldnt be  youre a liar you lie  well i mean i heard he hangs out at rest stops okay  and i keep buying it too and so maybe there is something wrong with me  i thought we were startin to trust each other  i got a message from my sister saying theres a box at your house with a fat suit in it   whatve you got a different one for each trimester  you had your sister   break into my house  which one are you wearin right now  is this the readytoburst model  now theres zero trust here goodbye  its been fun   not   michael had hoped something more dramatic  would have come out ofhis mouth  or at least more current  oh youre so right michael i really cant be trusted  cause im fakin it  not  hello michael well my wife and i  finally had the thrill of seeing a plus sign on a pregnancy test  youre gonna be a daddy   on the next arrested development  barry gets a big break on his case  the fat girl in my skip churchs case not fat  the attorney bought her a fat suit oh ive got another case  maggie is suing you for paternity   and for the first time lucille prays  take something else from us do whatever you have to  to keep my boy from going to war   and buster is on his way  when he decides to pursue a longdelayed rite of passage  loose seal watch out for loose seal  i dont care about lucille  she lies   and then a seal bites
