                now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything  and the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together  its arrested development  michael bluth paid an unexpected visit to his mother  you look pretty mom  what do you need  need why do you think i need something  well youre too busy for us no ones seen you  going on all those dates with rita  or should i say play dates  michael had recently dated a woman he later found out was mentally challenged  were not seeing each other any more but its for the best  im actually kind of relieved its over  actually michael had been so devastated by their breakup  that hed even broken out the old guitar  maybe you should talk to someone  like my mom  i dont know does she play guitar  so cant a guy call his mom pretty without it seeming strange  amen  and how about that little piece of tail on her  cute  ive opened a door here that i regret  oh hes just talking about his stupid turtle  she has a name mother  and its mother  buster had recently brought home a turtle  in an incredibly misguided attempt to make his mother jealous  stay in this box that unclefather oscar left behind  in fact it was a box of oscars legally obtained medical marijuana   oh good youve already got grass  primo bud real sticky weed  although i was getting a little worried because she was moving really slowly last week  and then she stopped  yeah well in any event im here mom because you need me  as you know the bluth foundation dinner is a week away  i am your cochair and we dont want to relive the tba debacle  years earlier the bluths had a hard time agreeing on a cause  for their foundations first fundraiser  herpes  shrinkage  somebody saw seinfeld last night  neck flap  ovarian cancer gee i wonder who that was  im more for neck flap  yes  well ill be honest i havent heard anything that beats herpes  so they sent out invitations with the disease still to be announced  and much to their surprise  the bluths ended up raising over 25000 to fight tba  and then and heres the really horrible part  they did it again the following year  keep fighting little guy with your support of the bluth foundation  well live in a galaxy where tba does not exist  when people at the last gala found out we almost had a riot on our hands  well you dont have to worry about anything like that this year  because warden gentles is the new cochair  the guy who ran dads prison  hes here now installing cameras because of all your fathers escape attempts  uh yeah looks like i wont be going anywhere for a little while  what do i care huh i have a beautiful wife i have a wonderful hobby  hah look at me im having the time of my life  his hobby was making papiermch copies of his own head  oh before i forget do you know if these cameras are hidef  i certainly hope so  itll help me better understand george bluth  the main character of the latest and i pray final draft of my screenplay new warden  you wrote a screenplay huh  i promised myself i wasnt going to become one of those people  who were always going on about their screenplays  so ill just say i put together a staged reading with some fabulous young actors  and it was very well received  warden gentles had convinced his granddaughters teacher to mount new warden   as a school play  i understand ive been causing problems  nobody sells any coke in this pen without daddy getting a taste  beat him with a pillow case full of batteries  wards letting us hold the event in the new wing of the prison  after lockdown everyones going to spend the night in a cell  are they color or black and white  so michael i dont need your help at all  unless you need something from me  no im fine just thought i could help  relieved i dont have to  but he wasnt relieved  so he went home to complain to his sister lindsay  prisons the last thing we want people associating with the bluth name  plus whos going to want to go  wait this is going to be at the prison  oh great probably going to run into that warden  how do you know the warden  oh right uh he spoke at my school for a startled straight assembly  actually shed met with him in the hopes of using his prison as a location for a film  i think you will find the dessert both engrossing  and high grossing  so we dont get dessert  guess i have some reading to do  besides i doubt very much moms come up with a real disease to have a fundraiser for  i forgot we have a real disease i chose it  gvh graft versus host  its new its fatal and guess whos got it  youve  heard of bodies rejecting transplants  well in this case your transplanted hair is rejecting your body  either you remove your hair graft or the host you will get sicker and eventually die  can you think of any benefits  benefits no hell die  oh yeah no i get that but have there ever been any fundraisers  a husband with the headlining disease  everyones going to want to talk to me  youre making him keep the hair  did you see the attention supermans wife got  besides  tobias wants it too  oh shes right this is going to be great for me  because im going to star in the video gobs making for the gala  oh yeah itll be very uplifting  oh here let me get that for you  thank you  oh oh this is going hurt  you know what were going to need this from another angle  and you sure youre okay  oh probably i cant feel anything  hows my hair  its fine its sucking the life out of you tobias  i mean everything has gone crazy the gala mom and warden gentles  i mean what is in it for him i think hes taking advantage of mom  did it ever occur to you that maybe warden gentiles likes her  likes her what  no i mean likes her like is attracted to her  whos the her in that sentence  mom warden gentles likes mom  her  im afraid im with michael on this  the guy runs a prison he can have any piece of ass he wants  and if he likes her in that sense it makes it even worse  i dont want mom mixed up with the sort of creep that would have her as a fetish  oh michael youre just feeling neglected by your mother  you wanted to go to this with her didnt you  hey i dont need to take my mom to a gala okay  only losers go to those things with their parents im going with my son  oh i may skip that i dont like galas  actually he loved galas all kids do  oh come on dont leave your uncle teabag hanging  please dont call yourself that  what he was having trouble with was looking directly at his dying uncle  i cant stand by and watch mom get hurt i have to get down there  this is heartbreaking  got to get this for the video  hey george michael you want to put your head down there by his drainage shunt  buster meanwhile was also feeling abandoned by mother  mother  i have no one now  but at that very moment his true father returned  unclefather oscar what are you doing here  well you know me  i could never leave a little bud behind  oh a hug nice  you havent seen a little box with a turtle on it have you  oh yeah my turtle was living in it before he ate all the grass and died   he ate all the grass  yeah   well its been great catching up  wait wait where are you going  no i cant stay because if my brother finds out that im here  he can try switching places again and i cant go back to prison  wait wait wait  if my father comes in you can hide in one of gobs tricks  i cant  at least you can stay and help me bury my poor turtle  or we could cremate it  and maeby was having a harder time finishing warden gentles screenplay than he did  youre a reader  howd you like to read something fun that we could talk about  on the way to the prison gala  oh im actually going to sit that out  im just burnt out on prisons lately  well this might change your mind  is that a screenplay  well thats what youre going to tell me  and michael raced to warn his mother of the wardens intentions   you cant park there no stair car parking  sorry i forgot  sorry  everything looks delicious  oh  one eyes a wonderful chef  ive had to go to his parole hearings twice and lie through my teeth to keep him here  hi i just uh wow  what are you guys doing  its perfectly innocent  but i can see how if our roles were reversed  i might have you beaten with a pillowcase full of batteries  ill give you two a moment  thank you  i dont know why i always assume everyones read my screenplay  what is wrong with you  that man is being wonderful to us  and that doesnt concern you mother  for all you know he could be trying to seduce you  oh michael youre crazy  i certainly hope so  im trying to seduce him  whos the i in that sentence  me  you  her  michael had just discovered that his mother was interested in another man  mom wants to sleep with the warden  what oh god   great  great  the man is old enough to be her contemporary lindsay  plus shes married okay she cant be writhing around underneath  what is wrong with you  its disgusting god  take it easy  no its just ive always had a thing about mom and dad being together   i know that  i have a sense of propriety my god  gob weve had this conversation  when  the last time you ended up seeing mom and dad go at it  what no god michael i did no such thing  he did very much that thing  when his parents got intimate in the conjugal trailer two years ago  but thankfully hed found a way to forget that  ive got a thing of pills in my pocket  i dont suppose i could convince you to grab me one  luckily that worked too  i  cant even hear this  you may not like it that mom has needs  but it never bothered you when dad was running around  well that was different  well how about when she was sleeping with uncle oscar  the guy looks just like dad i dont know hes family  it seemed very natural theyd be together  ooh whatwhat what is natural  is there new legislation on this now  george michael was concerned about family love after reading maebys script  which he took as a subtle message to him from his cousin  listen new fish that bunk was open  because the last guy wouldnt do the things that youre going to do  were going to do things  anything can happen when two people share a cell cuz  um ill ill go with you to the prison  george michael what i want you to do is run upstairs  and run a nice bath for uncle tobias  and i want you to help him get in the tub can you do that for me  thanks  and dont make the water too hot the scabs come right off  so come on lindsay what are we going to do about mother  honestly michael all this mother talk  youre starting to sound a lot like buster  and michael realized there was somebody else in the family that would care about this  busters going to take this so hard  i cannot let my brotherget hurt  oh its on standby  got another one in you  buster meanwhile was enjoying being with oscar  but oscar was longing for his sweet freedom  say you dont have any sweet freedom or tropical leaves  or  any of the hawaiian blends do you  someones coming  oh get in the cage and hide behind the mirror itll look empty  oscar never got a chance to hide behind the mirror  although it wasnt the first time hed been knocked out by a powerful lid  hey buster listen  i got some bad news about mom  shes planning on spending the night with another man  gob  no not another brother  oh then why do we care  what is wrong with everyone buster  youve got to talk to mom about this she cant possibly do it  if dad finds out hell go berserk  dad finds out about what  well i guess ive got no choice now  dad ive got some bad news about mom and warden gentles dating  better sit down  okay whats the news  theyre dating  oh yeah because shes my wife oh yeah damn it  surprised youre not more upset about this  when you first told me but you see time passes  besides its only dinner in the office its not le cirque  howd you know it was in his office  well where the hell else are they gonna go at 400 in the afternoon  it was around 400 you already know about this   come on   youre up to something right  you both are  shes working the warden youre making fake heads  youre planning an escape  how dare you i ought to shave your head  and make you sit under that camera all night mister  unbelievable i was worried that this guy was gonna take advantage of mom  you both were taking advantage of him  i dont know why i work so damn hard to keep this family together  michael can i talk to you for one sec  and thats when george sr got a call from lucille  p2252  howdy doody thats it  now you get back here so you can smuggle me out past the guards  before michael starts blabbing  you know what you can smuggle yourself out  you want to get away from me so bad youre free  but im free too baby  im staying in the conjugal trailer with the warden tonight  him  hey why is there an ambulance out front  honey the car is here  hey do you need a ride youll have to lie down  im not going the whole thing is a scam  mom was just using that warden to try to get dad out shes not trying to seduce him at all  oh no she is shes spending the night with him  she just called to ask me to bring her a tube of vag  table paste hi george michael  youre going too huh  yeah i thought i would um just go with maeby  and support her through this whole graft versus host thing  and michael himself was feeling a little like the host  that the grafting family was rejecting  great go  its a very important cause  ill just stay here and read  but this too would prove challenging as the family had no books  other than those  and thats when michael got a glimpse into the wardens true intentions with his mother  you were just using me to get even with the man who broke out of your prison  that escape cost me my promotion  and youll pay for the loss of 2300 a year  but you gave me presents  we made love  ive given you one last present  enjoy the chlamydia lucille  take this newlydiseased woman to the hole  i wish id read the man inside me  george sr needed to escape  but his handmade replica would never fool the cameras  so he searched through gobs magic stuff to find something that might  well that was a freebie  hey gob glad youre here i thought youd be at the gala  yeah dad made me move my stuff out of busters room  but only after hiding himself in the cage to get past the cops at the door  go  moms being set up we have to get into that prison  its after lockdown  come on gob you were gonna break out of this place once  i know you can help me break in  its not a jamba juice michael  shouldnt be that hard to break into  and buster returned only to find no evidence of his unclefather  hey fatheruncle dad  i was just bringing some juice for my pet  wait a minute youre not really smiling  im oscar  he  did it again i told you he would  i cant go through this again i cant be caged  and buster realized he needed to give his true father his freedom  but it was a freedom that didnt last long  and as the prison gala was underway  the guys arrived for their break in  with the help of one of george srs instruments of escape  you think this is gonna work  its a jetpack michael what could possibly go wrong  now just make sure you tell me before you hit any buttons  good now we know what the strap was for   okay under the crotch  need a new plan yeah  wish i knew the layout of this place  way ahead of you michael  drew a map of it on my stomach its upside down so it might be a little awkward  it was awkward  i drew us i think were like right there  hey guys  if youre gonna party you want to bring it inside  that was a freebie  well the new facility isnt so bad huh  its a lot like school only its airconditioned  so i guess we can just uh just choose a cell to stay overnight in  oh great you could take me through your thoughts about the screenplay beat by beat  sure yeah  because anything can happen when two people share a cell cuz  its a line from new warden  oh oh okay yeah  i dont know what i was worried about  that would be the happiest moment george michael would ever experience in his life  and the warden was happy too  what a treat  the man who cost me my promotion ends up back in my care  and i dont think theres going to be an im oscar website this time  i think this time ill do a podcast  graft versus host  sounds like a tennis match between steffi graf and happy days star donny host  its most  but its far deadlier  hello im gob bluth  as a magician i can make a lot of things disappear  there are some things i cant make disappear  no not that candy ball machine  the disease gvh without your help  this is tobias  when toby first came into the family none of us much wanted him around  but thats because we couldnt see what was on the inside  but lately thats all weve been able to see  but what was tobias to do  have his hair plugs removed  the doctor says id be completely healed if i were to do that  he just needs his hair plugs out  doctor says thats the cure  theres a cure  no way that horse hair is my ticket back into society  youll cut it after those idiots at the gala accept me as one of their own  were giving money for this guy to keep his hair transplants  id rather give to tba this is bull  bleep   the crowd began to grow unruly  and just as the prisoners had proven they could throw a gala as well as the rich  so the rich proved they could throw a riot just as well as the prisoners  and lucille was brought to the conjugal trailer  mom  michael what are you doing  i cannot let you go through with this you cant sleep with him  oh yes i can  im making up for the heartbreak your father has caused me  he doesnt need me you dont need me  of course i need you mom  my heart is kind of broken too  ive been kind of denying it lately but you know its just i cant deal  with the fact that my familys falling apart now that i really need you  oh michael honey  i want to cry so bad  but i dont think i can spare the moisture  well listen heres  the problem is that gentles doesnt really care for you  hes just using you to get back at dad for escaping  at least thats according to his screenplay   you read it   yeah  did you like the chlamydia thing i gave him that  you gave him chlamydia  he had crabs and i said youre gonna get laughs  then what am i doing  if dad doesnt care theres no real threat and i guess just knock yourself out  wheres gentles ill kill him   george   dad  i cant let you do this  i cant let what we have as lousy as it may be at times be destroyed  this is where you escaped to to prison for me  no one is breaking this family apart no one  you know what i think i needed to hear that  sorry about the wait george  if youre here who do we have in the delousing tank  im guessing oscar  no  i cannot take another 2300 hit  ill tell you what  you let oscar out and you give us an hour in here and  well call it even  please ward  i cant say no to the woman who gave me chlamydia  one hour  we ready to have some fun  im so glad i didnt cry  that i didnt need to hear  on the next arrested development  george michael gets closer to his family  that was close huh maeby  oh shes in the next cell  looks like were gonna be sharing a cell all night cuz  george michael experiences his unhappiest moment ever  buster tries to forget his recent losses  by breaking out the old guitar  and gob finally faces a phobia hed faced before  no not here  wait ive seen this before  oh god ive seen this before
