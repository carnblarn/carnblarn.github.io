                now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything  and the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together  its arrested development  michael was heading to work when he saw something he had never seen before lunch  his twin sister lindsay  youre up  yeah i work for our attorney now  bob loblaw of course  what is he thinking  i mean hows it going  lousy  i only took this nanny job so hed give me a free divorce and then marry me  so id never have to work again  but all he seems to care about is that daughter of his  i got my horse to canter today first time  ive always wanted to make love on a horse  and tomorrow were going to work without a lungeline  thats so funny because i can put my leg behind my head  i mean come on im the nanny  of course who wouldnt want to snog the nanny  snog is that another one of your new britishisms  it was  michael had recently fallen bumovernoggin for a beautiful englishwoman called rita  did i say snog again oh bloody hell  listen you want to win over bob you got to win over the kid and heres what you do  you find something that youre good at and you share it with her  and while youre at it share it with us too  and try to not to act so desperate  oh my god did i miss a call  this is rita just wanted to say hi  im on my way to the train station byebye  shes leaving ive got to get over there  michael raced to the station  god is that how i look  where rita was being given her ticket  and your instructions  call me if you get in over your head  hey hi there rita hey michael  hi where are you going and how long you going for  youre right do not answer that  you know im not getting clingy  why are you breathing like that  oh i wasnt hurrying to come stop you i was out on for my daily uh  do you run at all  oh yes  i was in the olympics once  i won a silver medal  youre that rita leeds oh my goodness  and the silver medal yes and you came in second  now im very embarrassed to be out of breath in front of you  but you take my breath away  oh michael  youre such  bleep   michael was stunned  he assumed rita was using the word  bleep  in the american sense  meaning weak or cowardly  in fact rita meant it in the british sense  meaning sweet or gentle as in pussycat  the jerries arent so bad  theyre just being led by a rotten apple  oh reggie  fighting for your country youre such a pussy  when i miss your lips ill put a  bleep  in my mouth and think of you  that also had a different meaning over there  michael returned home hoping to take solace   in his sons company  hey just the guy i was looking for  thinking you and i should maybe go play a little catch you know  maybe go for a run do some guy stuff  but were not good at that stuff  yes i am  we both are  michael and his son had never been a very successful athletic team  in fact the only thing george michael really liked  was hanging motionless from the monkey bars  which the presidents council on fitness ranks as  slightly easier than the slide  anyway i was just thinking that maybe we should  emphasize athletics a little bit more in this family  im gonna start us off with a protein drink okay  still doing that huh  well i do think we should go for a run huh some real guy stuff  im supposed to go fabric shopping with ann today  i think we can go butcher  uh uh no were making a gown shes gonna be in a beauty pageant  yeah whos ann  mymy girlfriend shes  youve met her so many times met her and met her  no i know who annabelle is  whos the ann thats in the beauty pageant  thats her her name isnt annabelle thats ann  no i know her names not annabelle  thats how i remember her name cause her bodys kind of shaped like a  shes the belle of the ball  what is she doing in the beauty pageant  shes she running the lights or something  shes in it shes a contestant  its sort of an inner beauty pageant  ah  there it is  is it like a christian thing  well its half its at the state fair which this year is gonna be a church and state fair  it seems the state had run out of money and was going to cancel the fair  until it was resurrected by this man  who agreed to cover the fairs costs if it included a church presence  i got some news for you  theres no such thing as an inner beauty pageant  theyre just gonna pick the chick with the best t and a  as a child maeby had been entered into a number of progressive pageants  that claimed to celebrate beauty in all its forms  but the winners still tended to have it going on in the conventional sense  remember how badly you used to want to win  no i remember how badly you used to want me to win  yeah we should have  i dont know where that hair of yours came from  shameless plugs on placentia  looks pretty good huh  and theyre not licensed which means big savings  thats been happening a lot lately  you know what this is the perfect thing to do  no mom im not gonna do it  oh no no not you bobs daughter hope  if i can get hope this crown  maybe her father might just want to crown me  if you know what i mean  im guessing have sex but thats meeting you more than halfway  tobias  want to clean up that mirror  and the vase  perhaps if i can coach a certain young lady to victory in this pageant  i can gain back the respect of my wife  ill show them a little t and a  you cant make me do it dad  tobias and ann  my ann  no i dont think we need any help  oh george michael shes a girl  i need to teach her how to be a woman  within her lies a queen  let me out that queen  yeah i think you just did  michael  gob  oh let me get that for you  um so  a young neighborhood tough by the name of steve holts gonna be here any minute  your son  according to him  and a dna test  i heard the jurys still out on science  anyway he wants to go to the fair but i dont want to hurt his feelings  so i need you to do it  just tell him that im out of town on one of my trips  im not gonna lie to your son  come on i lie to yours all the time  michael im not ready to be a dad  plus im gonna be very busy this week being a judge for the pageant  gob had been a pageant judge for years  you cant believe what it does for your sex life  i dont want to hear it  i dont want to say it  first place chick is hot but has an attitude doesnt date magicians  second place is someone weird usually like a chinese girl or a geologist  but third place although a little bit plain has super low selfesteem  so i step in and uh lay her crown upon my sweet head  have i missed this euphemism   steve holt  i should go  hes hiding from me isnt he  you know uh you got to stop saying your name all the time  its just they have this fatherson triathlon and  i just wanted him to do it with me  stupid huh  oh thats a pretty tough race  only for a wimp a wuss a  bleep   and steve didnt mean pussycat  uh steve howd you like to do that triathlon with me   are you serious  yeah  uncle mike  steve holt  both men felt good about themselves   uncle mike  steve holt  but gob didnt share their enthusiasm  so this is how michael gets rid of my son  by stealing him  well ill just have to steal something of his  like say his bicycle  as a placeholder  michael was trying to prove his manliness with steve holt  rita hey its michael  just want to let you know that im running the triathlon at the fair and if youre back in t  oh i cant believe i chose this moment to call you  meanwhile at the church and state fair  maeby was trying to enroll in the pageant  sort of  your situation poses a problem  let me talk to our chairman  hey what are you doing maeby  its surely  im just here to prove that all these pageants care about is looks  just watch surelys inner beauty will get trumped by her outer icky  what happened to your nose  its part of the disguise  isnt it cool  the same one nicole kidman wore in the hours  it had been purchased for her at a charity auction shed attended as a studio executive  10000  by jamie kennedy  oh youre such a dear  but im not putting you in my remake of a thoroughly polite dustup  miss woolfbeak although it costs quite a bit to put in a ramp for you we got approval  youre in  as maeby found herself stuck in a beauty pageant  lucille was meeting with attorney bob loblaw  about getting her son out of the army  my god hes already lost a hand  if he loses a leg how will we ever get him out of the apartment  well the army does have a oneinoneout program  where the inductee is relieved of duty once he enlists someone to take his place  so im supposed to find some poor innocent soul and hook him  well thats not going to help sign anyone  wheres your hand  oh it got stuck in the prize hole again  i told you not to play that stupid game anymore  ah  there goes number three  i wasnt playing it  i was just trying to get my other one back  hi sorry sorry totally forgot about this meeting  whats going on  your fathers gotten a lot of bad press because of the escape attempts  volunteer for something  ill do anything to get out of this  bleep  apartment  youll do anything to get out of  bleep  in this apartment  ah youre drunk  yeah mom can you just and dad  you know why do we even need the surrogate   you know dads in the apartment  dont come in here   dont come in here  dont come in here   i said not to come in  would you get out here please   im watching the game  i said not to come in  i did not spending money on a surrogate so you can just  im watching the game  i lost him  youve got your hands full trying to make this guy look good  theres a startled straight program at the fair  which involves you speaking with atrisk male youth  to scare them away from criminal behavior  okay i can do that  uh im gonna need some big blown up photos of your mother  theyre talking about your time in prison dad  oh okay  why not i mean uh if i dont win this thing im gonna be back there anyway  at risk male youth  that spells army  and thats when buster discovered a recruiting pool the government had been fishing for years  i may head down there too  i dont know dad startled straight  im not sure youre the guy for that  but ill look into it while im down at the fair signing up for a triathlon  triathlon do you know how hard a triathlon is  people lose control of every bodily function  didnt you ever see that video  its like your mother on new years eve  actually lucille went down faster  youre not even in shape  youre gonna fall apart in front of everybody  youre kind of scaring me dad  you see  perfect for this startled straight thing  tobias was getting ann ready for the talent portion of the pageant  i think we need something with a little more spectacle in the act  something that will make you look small and pretty in comparison  a camel  you know she has a really lovely singing voice  ill sing to the camel  yes we can google some disco songs with the word hump in them  cute  no that sounds a bit racy  okay  he may be afraid of sex but youre not going to win without it  no im not afraid of sex  oh good have sex with this girl right now  do it go  get in there have some sex with her right now  i didnt think so  ann you need to decide whether you want a man or a boy  i know how id answer  give us some room george michael i cant breathe  okay now youre upsetting the talent out  michael meanwhile had begun training for the triathlon  to keep from humiliating himself in front of rita  dont ask can i ask i can  you can control your bladder when youre dead  no blood no oil  theres no i in win  michael returned confident in his manliness  when he ran into his son who was questioning his own  hey how is that pageant going  well turns out ann doesnt want me around during it  really  hey now you and me can go to that fair together tomorrow after all  yeah  yeah do some man stuff  hey actually i have already signed up for the fatherson triathlon  oh okay great yeah i did want to do that with you  i mean ive already promised steve holt  i thought he was older and more manly  you dont think im manly  no no its just uh  darn that annabelle she ruins everything  but the next morning michael awoke to discover  every muscle in his body was exacting revenge  oil  and so was his brother gob  hey does anyone know why my handlebars are in my bed  the church and state fair was in fall swing  and lindsay watched with pride as hope loblaw  did an original number that lindsay herself had written  all state on you  and now please welcome annabelle veal  performing we three kings with a camel tow  we three kings  michael arrived at the fair sore from overtraining  cant really go that high im in a lot of pain here  yeah you know i figured youd be that way so uh coach gave me these   theyre uh pills filled with oxygen  yeah  they keep you from being incontinent  have one theyre called oxyincontinent  steve didnt have that quite right  but michael thought rita might be coming and he was desperate to impress her  meanwhile maeby was trying to get knocked out of the pageant  pope impersonator church  how has god influenced your life  about just as much as big bird and the keebler elves  well my faith wouldve been shaken if he had taken my legs too  gob bluth state  i was betrayed by my brother michael  whos your favorite family member and why  definitely not my shallow materialistic mother  who only cares about looks  i think we all feel that way about our mothers and we all have legs  meanwhile george sr arrived at the startled straight tent  ill be waiting out here with my enlistment forms  so go in there and scare them right into my open arm  but as it turns out the fair had two startled straight tents  george sr had wandered into the churchsponsored one  do you want to become some guys girlfriend  intended to scare gay young men into a heterosexual lifestyle  you want to have some guy reach around you in the middle of the night  start messing with your junk  is he ugly  no its pitch black  you dont see him and it never stops guys  and everybody acts like its no big deal  is there a cover charge  and the inner beauty pageant was down to the final three  will it be the beautiful hope loblaw  the stalwart annabelle veal  or the justifiablybitter surely woolfbeak  it became clear that surely was going to win  im sorry  this is wrong  and thats when maeby displayed some real inner beauty  one of these girls deserves to win  she can stand  the lords blessed her  maeby  thats how i know her  let us pray  oh for gods sake  and michael now feeling a little woozy  arrived to see the triathlon course  which consisted of several tricycles five inflatable pools  what the hell is this  and fathers and sons being manacled together  dont let it psyche you out  did that oxyincontinent set in yet  you knew this is what the race was  kind of i mean they change it every year so you cant replicate it on your lawn but  why did you let me train so hard  i just thought you wanted to hang out and do guy stuff  this isnt guy stuff  i dont know why i thought youd want to do this   its stupid huh  no steve steve  youre not going anywhere  youll do it with me  were chained together but you know ritas not here yet and what the hell  lets go win this thing  lets win this thing  what the hell  come on lets go ahead and start up  and after the pageant george michael went to congratulate ann  well congratulations on coming in third thats amazing  and i heard youre the first camel act to ever crack the top ten too  so thats like a record  and im a bit relieved because um  i was i thought maybe if you came in first you would have outgrown me  outgrown you  that is the term ive been looking for  it seems gob was right about what happens to thirdplace contestants  i met a man  george michael was devastated  it seemed hed lost his girl and his father because he wasnt man enough  and he was faced with a choice  michael and steve holt finished their triathlon in first place  of course they were way older  believe it or not that took about everything ive got  i dont know what was in that pill but i do not feel great  gonna get a little worse before it gets better   really  but we won  okay  hey possible nephew   oh hey  michael your sons signing up for the army  what you signed him up for the army  youre right if he goes in i get out  ive got to get my name on his form  hang on hey i got to get there i got to stop this  hey do this with me  and thats when rita noticed michael  wait for me wait for me  michael  hey  could you not finish  no first place first place i swear but im sorry i got to go do something  wait im dizzy  uncle mike come on ill take you  no no steve steve steve  hiya  no lets go come on come on lets go  and meanwhile george sr hadnt succeeded in startling anyone but himself  i mean theres nothing to do all day except lift weights  and fold laundry get thrown into a cage with a bunch of sweaty men  excuse me  i cant go back  i cant go back  well im glad he wont be there  george sr came across a us army combat humvee  and the pope mobile  and he decided to escape in the bulletproof one  no no no no no come on  i cant go back  and michael caught up with george michael  what are you doing   who was three rungs away from being in the army  im becoming a man dad  isnt that what everybody wants  of course not gob can you get us out of these chains please  so you steal my son and now you need me to save yours  all right one key coming up  hes a magician  we need you to sign this form  no its good dad theres all sorts of benefits and its like a
