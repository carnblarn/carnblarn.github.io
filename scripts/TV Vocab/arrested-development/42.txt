like that michael can end your career  not in every case  these are dangerous people michael  theyll do whatever it takes to get inside this family and just bring us down  british people  oh theyre polite and the men all sound gay but they will rip out your heart  and their breath  and you want to go after these people  well yes it takes a little courage michael  i know thats not your strongest

perhaps if youre willing to lose 20 pounds  the clerk was asking for a bribe but this was lost on michael  well you guys do go for the jugular  if you find someone with a passport were here til 800  and do stay for the poppuns  so michael went to the local pub  bloody yank  to see if he could find someone with a british passport  welcome to the yellowfang i am lionel and the soup of the day is  whats the soup of the day mum  bread  and the soup of the day is bread  unless youre just here for the poppuns  and thats when michael saw the most beautiful woman hed ever seen  not her  wait for it

some stupid person in your family  now back off you  bleep  ponce  wow  dad was not kidding about their breath  michael had just been threatened by a foulmouthed british man  its michael im not dressed  gob this is michael  shouldnt you be getting ready for your free bird trick  i couldnt get the rights to free bird  im thinking about calling it free i dont know chicken  i thought you were investigating dads sinister british connection  yeah i tried but but when i was leaving  one of those british guys came after me and told me to back off  cant believe it but dad may have been telling the truth this might be dangerous  so you came back here to hide like a child  what are you doing locked in my office exactly  hiding from a child  big difference  gob steve holt is your son he probably just feels a connection  he doesnt know what he feels  im tired of being told  my god what is this feeling  well you know thethe feeling that youre  that youre feeling isis what many of us call a feeling  but its not like envy or even hungry  could it be love  i know what an erection feels like michael no its the opposite  its its like my heart is getting hard  maybe i am ready to be a father  hey dad  its my son gob  what is it with the fathers in this family always trying to deceive their  and thats when michael realized that the man who threatened him must have been hired by george sr  im the patsy  well i got to go  george michael im sorry but were going to talk about that girl later okay  now all i have to do is find that lookalike michael  michael  hey  thats a womans wig  i was told it was a bob  and michael confronted his father  find out anything  yeah i did dad i found out that no matter how many times i promise myself  that im not going to fall for it i always end up getting hustled by you  what are you talking about  the guy that you hired to threaten me after i looked into the british connection  wait wait wait wait wait somebody threatened you  thats a wonderful performance dad youre a regular brad garrett  but i dont watch tv at 300 in the afternoon and you can forget about pleading not guilty  guilty we got to plead guilty  what  michael i didnt hire anyone iii swear  if someone came after you theyre for real  come on youre serious  i told you these are bad guys  they do not want this information out  he said that he was going to come after somebody stupid in our family that could be buster  could be gob  youre not guilty  we have to plead guilty  weve got to plead guilty  weve got to throw ourselves on the mercy of the court   we got to get andy griffith  andy griffith in the suit  and michael went to cancel with rita  sorry i just wanted to let you know that im not going to be needing your passport after all  were just going to go to court plead guilty thatll be that  so its byebye to rita then  actually i was wondering ifif you might want to  i wouldnt  ill make you blue  rita was just talking about the fingerpaint  but michael didnt know that  i was just wondering if you might want to bid me fair morrow  thats all see ya  michael was filled with selfloathing  had he been jack the ripper he would have soothed himself in a most unsavory way  but instead he just sat in his car and ate a whole thing of candy beans  and back at the penthouse gob had been called to see his father  its a new plan right you put me in the trick  you make me the guy in the cage  okay i just got to say im really blown away by this  you really want to be part of my world  i do  god i feel like my heart is straining through my shirt  they take the ankle monitor off when i get to court  so you make me disappear you put tobias in the cage  and by the time they realize that that guy is not me  im running through the storm drains to freedom  where every day it rains  pennies from heaven  it was bird today  gob i know youre looking for a twin for your illusion  and theres somebody id like to put in a plug for  uh correction make that 4000 plugs   oh god  oh come on  meestagay  hes bleeding meestagay  no no no no ii was scared too but i realized it was of being a leading man  oh i can just taste those meaty leading man parts in my mouth  all right listen to me the trick has changed we want you to play me now  oh but that would mean id have to sh  shave my very tender head i see okay  well perhaps i jumped the gun on those new head shots  and later that day michael arrived at the courthouse  i cant believe youre just giving up like this  the guy threatened our family we have to plead guilty  no im talking about that girl you said you had a date with  all right so i lied it wasnt a date  but you could have made one with her  i think that poppuns knocked the courage out of you  i guess im just not in her league  how did you hear about the poppuns  it was on the news  an unlicensed mary poppuns takes down another tourist  is this the work of the itsybitsy ira  i dont want to talk about this right now dad were going to go in there  andy griffiths going to whisper something were going to plead guilty nice and simple  you didnt hear we lost andy  what what are you talking about  he didnt like his trailer  he thought we were making fun of him  no one was making fun of andy griffith  i cant emphasize that enough  oh god dont look now but gobs doing his magic show  oh boy a stupid magic show we got to watch this  a big turnout  i think a lot of people are probably here for the free chicken  gather round humans  and i will show you the plight of an innocent man who yearns to be  free as a bird  ive got to start labeling these suits  who shall i send on this journey to that dangling cage  oh pick me oh  look can i be in his stupid trick please  steve holt what are you doing here  i just came to see the magic show  i didnt know it was you  do you like magic  no  i love it  and at that moment gob chose to show his own son what he was capable of  ive decided i will be performing the feat myself  wait were back to hair  fortunately for tobias however  hed found it too painful to part with his new hair  boy did i catch a break  so he opted to wear a bald cap  this chicken shall be wrongly cooped  whats in his hand is that chicken  oh my god dad are you all right  i fooled his own son  i am a leading man  and gob himself was running through the storm drains  free as a chicken  and george sr needed to escape too  i got him  keeps him out of the kitchen  and michael seeing what a life of cowardice leads to  decided hed had enough of it  and soon george came to and it was time to render a plea  the prosecutions got that stud from la law  i love my trailer  in the matter the of people v bluth how do you plead  we plead  not guilty   michael what are you doing  im tired of the cowardice  youre not guilty were going to fight this weve got the truth on our side  they dont have a  bleep  prayer  send the check to my accountant  this is where andy could have helped us  well im proud of you  its about time i showed a little courage  i just hope those brits arent as dangerous as dad says  well theyre not going to get any closer to us if they do were going to see them coming  oh my god  thats rita  i told her i was coming here and she came   thats rita  yeah  wow she is way out of his league  im glad youre here  i want to call you sometime and take you out  oh id really like that  good  and then just to prove he wasnt a coward  he went one step further  and rita was happy to be in michaels life as well  for you see rita had a secret of her own
