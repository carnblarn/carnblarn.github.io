                now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything  and the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together  its arrested development  michael was trying to include his brother in the business at his fathers request  so the last couple of months have seen us hemorrhaging money  but he was finding himself overwhelmed by the change  is it my turn to speak yet ive got a good one  were gonna wait till after lunch for the tricks  thats not a trick michael  its a business opportunity  okay you can turn the music off i already shot my wad  off  no thats tape  i have got a quick way for us to literally be showered with money  thats where the penny thing with the  bonus  anyway it involves us making some money with our mexican friends from colombia  i think theyre called colombians  oh i forgot were being politically correct now  anyway theres a company there that wants to develop some timeshares with us  i told them that well sell them our blueprints for 100 grand  gob were prohibited from doing any business outside the country  while were under investigation  translation wish id thought of that  nice translating dad  oh also had this slogan made up  a colombian cartel that wont kidnap and kill you  i underlined wont cause it makes the competition look like  im serious were not doing it  its illegal and uh its also kind of a stupid way to make a quick buck  its not stupid youre stupid  nice pout dad  i wasnt calling you stupid i was calling the idea stupid  and if youd spend a little bit more time learning about the business  and less time with tricks youd know that  if i didnt have a live dove in my pants right now  i would leap across this table and you know what forget it  lets go ahead and take five  michael was frustrated  and returned to his office to find lindsay  boy gob is driving me crazy  i finally got rid of him for a little while and dad put him right back in the business  you two have always fought  i think i even have video of that  you and half of orange county  as children george sr would often provoke the boys to fight one another  hes calling you a liar  i dont want your cards michael  he believed it created a competitive spirit  which equipped them for the challenges of life  lets keep it in frame  he also believed footage of the tussles would be a big hit  in the burgeoning home video market  he soon franchised the concept with such titles as  boyfights 2  a boyfights cookout  and backseat boyfights the trip to uncle jacks 70th  how do you think i feel  you werent even in the tapes  uh no i was talking about my marriage  are we still talking about the tapes  apparently not whats going on with your marriage  well as you know bob loblaw and i have had a secret little thing going  very secret he doesnt even know does he  he has not known of it thats correct  but last night he finally responded to one of my little hints  why wont you  bleep  me  look im not blind  youre an attractive woman and youve been dressing like a common whore  well ive been trying  but you asked me to represent you in your divorce  i cant see a client  well then recommend somebody else  well our copy boys very striking but he often has toner on his fingers  i meant another lawyer  so now i have to tell tobias were getting divorced you know break the news to maeby  plus fit an eyebrow pluck in there all before the weekend  perhaps you can talk to maeby while youre getting your eyebrows plucked  itll look like your eyes are watering cause youre sad  later that day michael went to his parents apartment to talk  about the problem he was having with gob  whats going on here  well theyre painting the whole building so im having the inside done too  and that goes into storage right  not into your apartment  que  whats spanish for i know you speak english  mom if youre gonna speak to these guys like this  you might want to sleep with one eye open  actually ill be sleeping at your place  paint fumes are deadly  you know dads under house arrest here  itll be nice to get a break from him too  besides i certainly cant recuperate here  recuperate  i didnt want to worry anyone  its a routine procedure very common for women my age  i see the apartments not the only thing getting a facelift  hope you kept your punch card youre about due for a free one  no  no no youre not getting a centavo until you finish all the work  you guys are both gonna be sleeping with your eyes open  mom however will not have a choice  dad need you to help me get rid of gob  that ship sailed 35 years ago  doesnt know anything about the business  today he suggested that we do an illegal colombian deal  you said that was legal  that was your idea  i may have mentioned it  you  told gob to do it didnt you  did you just want to get us at each others throats again like you used to do  with the boyfights videos  boyfights   luchas del muchachos   si luchas del muchachos   we had this video  si  the tapes were a big hit in latin america  dont look at me i had nothing to do with them  except for some of the baby buster shorts  maybe i was trying to teach you something  maybe i was trying to teach you how to compete  i didnt do it with buster and look how he turned out  hes buster  bebe buster  yo quiero leche yo quiero leche del madre  even though im so old  boy those tapes made quite an impression on these three painters  i think i turned out pretty darned well myself  oh you just turned out great  i used my contacts to get you a job and you quit  the job was at an iraqiowned toy store that was hoping to deter shoplifting  okay ill just take off this cheap fake huh  and we going to put on this sign  beautiful you like  they only wanted me because i had one hand  and i wont do it  thats not the way mother is raising me  like i wont compete with my older brother anymore  despite the way father raised me  well show you  just like i showed mr aljibaaly muhammed aabat  i stole the sign  of course i left my hand there also  but fao aljabaaly muhammed aabat wasnt the only one having trouble scaring kids  so was hollywoods third youngest movie studio executive  maeby funke  the creatures in your imagination  thats a bloodsucker  it looks like alf  you got a week to fix it  you must be the creature that ate our cat  and michael met up with gob  hey gob why didnt you tell me that colombian thing was dads idea  well dad said not to because you dont think im smart  and that i should take credit for it  well it was just dad trying to turn us against each other again  and of course i think youre smart okay  hey whats going on down there what are you doing  you dont want a hungry dove down your pants  thats how tony wonder lost a nut  look i know that i dont know about this housing stuff  but ive got this christian girlfriend now  and shes trying to get me to be a better man and reconnect with my son  and im trying to get her to renounce god and  bleep  me  and i just want to prove to her that im worth it  well as always gob a mixed bag there  but the middle part sounded pretty admirable for a second so heres what i want to do  i want to get you your own banana stand franchise  and you can have steve work at it  youd do that for me  yes yeah you can design your own shack  choose my own location  whatever you want youre gonna be 100 in charge all right  but the most important thing is that we never let dad turn us against each other again  thanks michael  if you feel something moving down there its just the bird  i know it  and a few days later michael got a call from his son  hey dad did you know gob started a banana stand  yeah  that was my idea im trying to get us to be less competitive  thats gonna be difficult  plus they have a very aggressive slogan  gob had opened a new frozen banana stand like   whats going on you just thought youd put the stand right here  did the research  did you know that more frozen bananas are sold here  on this boardwalk than anywhere in the oc  dont call it that  also gonna need a check cause i went out of pocket on the new sign  oh and i need some bananas and some chocolate from the other branch  just take the sign down take the whole booth down youre cannibalizing our business  youre just scared of a little competish  you know you guys dont even have bananas so im not too worried  in fact you know what  me and my son are gonna kick your little shacks ass  dad its okay we can just work together with them  dad that makes sense we dont really even know the recipe  theres no recipe you just freeze a banana then you stick it in the  dont tell them stick it in the what  its okay son well figure it out  when we do well have the last laugh  well be the laughingstock of the boardwalk  meanwhile lindsay was preparing for her own competition  this is treat hell be representing you  he started off as my paralegal but hes a lawyer now  as of next monday  well well fudge that  lindsay just do me one favor  dont mention me by name when you talk about your future plans for dating  it reflects poorly on me  right right the conflict of interest  yeah that too  hello lindsay  tobias did you get a lawyer  only the bestlooking and best educated lawyer in the whole oc   dont call it that   okay  bob loblaw how are you  bobs representing you  he was  one day earlier tobias had spoken to him on the phone  whether  or not those promises were made explicit  you want me to be explicit  anyway as it turns out bob was offering to be my lawyer  and that night buster arrived with a postop lucille  there she is  she wants to know where you want to put her  she can take my room  she wants to know if i can sleep there too  she said thats very important to her  all right ill meet you up there mother  you better not lock it ill kick it in  oh by the way doctor said no kissing her on the face for one week  i was like make it two weeks see if i care  got a new hand  oh yeah im trying it out  guess who i ran into at the prosthetics shop while i was waiting for mother  sorry no refunds  and thats why you dont take your foot out of its wrapper  j walter weatherman  youre the man who used to scare us as children and one time as an adult  george sr had always used him to teach his children lasting lessons  they usually involved his prosthetic arm being ripped off  and thats why you always leave a note  you one of george bluths kids  hey i guess youll be scaring children yourself now  as a matter of fact i wont  if anything it strengthened my resolve to be more than just a onearmed man  even if it means me never taking a job again  a pulse makes him worth it  hello  listen i heard that you gave gob a banana stand  they did great he and steve took in over 700  they  did  yeah  so i guess the bluth companys got a new heir  and thats when michael realized it was time to get serious  george michael  you know where the banana suit is  that night maeby displaced by buster heard a noise  hello  george michael  im thirsty  and maeby knew she had found her bloodsucking creature  the next day michael took off work to man the banana stand  while his son manned a banana  how you doing there champ  is my name champ  its so hot  okay why dont you take five  not including the five minutes it takes to get out of this right   youre not getting out of it  attention everyone  why go to a banana stand when we can make your banana stand  i give you barbara and dee  dont worry these young beauties have been nowhere near the bananas  dad are they strippers  if i know your uncle theyre at least strippers  well i guess we have to up the ante  you know dad then theyre just going to up it and itll go back and forth all day  if thats what it takes thats what were going to do  and they did  but it was less entertaining than you might imagine  no matter what music was put under it  it was kind of funny to yellow submarine but who could afford it  so heres what happened at the end  hey stop fighting stop  theyre right okay this is insane were just boyfighting again  and for what  a hefty bagfull of pesos  youve been taking pesos  well dad said i should  dads involved with this  well he chose the location  and the strippers  and the sign every part of it really  wait a minute dont you see whats happening here  dads clearly going ahead with the colombian deal  and hes just laundering it through your banana shack  he pitted us against each other so id be too busy to notice  well you know what i think its time for us to teach dad a lesson  get the person who terrorized us the most in our childhood  shes still healing  lets get j walter weatherman  michael and gob had decided to teach their father a lesson  so we need the number of the onearmed man  im not giving you that  you want to use his disability to scare someone  thats everything im against  read the button mister  the only scary thing about a onearm man trying to scare someone is the fact  that he feels that his one arm is good for nothing but trying to scare somebody  its upside down  well lets see you try to put a button on with this  stop screaming its not scary  im going to get the number myself okay  because were not going to go through our lives being controlled by this guy  what is more pathetic than grown men being scared of their father  im thirsty  this continued for a while  and later michael and gob went to put their plan in action  well i gave the colombians back their money and i told them  you had no right to make the deal  have to warn you though they didnt sound too happy about it  lets just hope they dont try to get even by trying tocirsumventing the law  what is that supposed to mean  kidnap or michael said  what are you kidding i have an ankle monitor  i cant even go into the hallway without the cops coming up stop it  so clearly you know what youre doing  theres an off chance they might just want to take you leave the ankle  but anyhow  stall him  and michael went to solicit help for the lesson  how would you and some of your friends like to help us teach mr bluth a lesson  maybe pose as colombians  but we are guatemalan wont he know the difference  i think anything south of san diego will be just fine  rolando was in the groundlings  just classes  is it going to be unscripted like curb  george sr meanwhile had grown suspicious of his sons  what was that with michael just now  he wants to teach you a lesson  what kind of lesson  j walter weatherman lesson  hes going to fake a kidnapping and helicopter ride to colombia  hes going to teach me a lesson using my own scare toy  the  weatherman wouldnt do it  i think buster turned him  yeah well hell say yes for me  all right well go along with his lesson but were going to teach him one of our own  its got to be a secret okay  between a dad and his  his favorite son  dont worry pop   gob bluth doesnt cave  yeah you just did for me   well you asked me to so i thought  go go go its fine  and lindsay and tobias were back with the arbitrator  as you know it is very difficult to establish fault in a divorce  but one indicator is fidelity  now my client has not pursued sex outside of this marriage  nor in it  i got this one  can the same be said for you  oh absolutely ive done everything to make this marriage work  thats interesting can you tell me what your plans are for this evening  uh  i have plans with a friend  a man whats his name please  dont answer that  i withdraw the question  why dont we stop for the day  so mrs funke can get to her date with her mysterious mister  blahblahblah  at 830 unless you want to sit at the bar   it was the first time someone took tobiass side  bob bob  and he wanted to thank him  listen uh as much as i hate losing lindsay and everything  i feel like im making a friend in you  so i was wondering if maybe tonight you just want to uh  take in a movie or a shvitz or just stay in and nest  actually i was going to stay in my office tonight and work on my law blog  of course the bob loblaw law blog  wow you sir are a mouthful  while tobias was trying to get his mouth around bob loblaw  maeby was showing mort myers a monster of her own  ah oh its terrifying  who did that for you industrial light and magic  kopelson plastic and silicon  did he do land of the dead  yeah hes been in beverly hills for years  lets get our makeup people on it  and george sr waited for the fake kidnapping he knew michael had orchestrated  dont move  okay well lets do it  get into the box old man  oh a blanket who thought of that that is very nice  come on get in the trunk  what about my ankle monitor  we have have an ankle monitor deactivator  oh good see ive been meaning to get one of those  im not going to resist you guys because you know i dont want you to beat me  but the mistreated painters were actually looking forward to that part  oh i forgot my ipod  start the helicopter  and so michael believing himself to be aided by gob set to work  but this too produced lessthancompelling footage  and this is how that ended  put on the sound effects put on the sound effects  cd cd one cd one  track two track two  put the hostage here by the ottoman  get it out of here whats it doing in here  ottoman out  and george sr was released from his long journey into the living room  where am i  colombia where do you think  and you just missed the last train that will come through the jungle for three days  hes good he was a groundling  you have betrayed us we will make you pay and then we will go back for your sons  oh my sons no  they too will suffer for your terrible decisions  and you should really pay your workers what they deserve  not make them have to buy their own supplies  not just the painting the sanding too  yeah and the taping is very timeconsuming  and michael decided his father was ready to learn his lesson  and that is why  hes got my gun its loaded  get away ill shoot i will i will ill take you all out  this is all fake these guys are painters  ill kill you  oh god my arm  dad you just shot off this this guys arm  and thats why you dont teach your father a lesson  now whos the stupid one now  thank you gob  gob  you told him i thought we were a team  its not fun feeling stupid is it  you son of a  wait a minute i have to get my camera  what is all this whats going on  cheat out   i will kill you  im going to kill you  youre going out of frame  oh my god michael  dad it was an accident im sorry  and thats why you dont pit gob and me against each other  yes  yeah  you set me up  thats right  no more boyfights  j walter weatherman was in on it too  right from the very start  so you did use him  look at this place look at my home  freeze   drop the gun   oh god  were just trying to teach this guy a lesson  drop the gun  oh my god  busters good hand just came flying off  and thats why you dont use a onearmed person to scare someone  on the next arrested development  maeby finds a way to scare an entire generation  this christmas terror has a new face  im thirsty  gangee  we should start production on gangee 2  well i know she wanted a skin peel
