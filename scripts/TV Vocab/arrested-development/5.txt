                now the story of a wealthy  family who lost everything  and the one son who had no choice  but to keep them all together  its arrested development   michael bluth was  visiting his father in prison  anxious to get to the bottom  of some mysterious bookkeeping  it just doesnt make any sense dad  where did this money come from why did it  end up in the international accounts file   george sr was also  anxious but less about the bookkeeping  this game is never gonna happen half  of these guys are still in their cuffs  i hate to be a buzzkill but  im trying to get you out of here  well im trying to get us out of last  place michael were playing rahway next week  word has it that theyre getting jose canseco  im starting to wonder why i even bother coming    bluth right  field  that is ridiculous   you wont even talk to me   im catcher or im nothing   michael returned to work  where his assistant kitty  greeted him with some startling news  your wifes on line one    michaels wife had  been dead for  two years  my what  kitty  realized her mistake  i said your wife is on line one  but not immediately  oh oh god  im sorry georges wife your mother  im so used to being georges assistant   kitty had been george sr  s fiercely loyal assistant for years  and michael suspected that she  had the information he needed  hey kitty listen you wouldnt know  if we had any documentation on  these international accounts would you  thats actually not any of your business  my business thats not any of my business  hey mom  are you aware weve been downgraded to  being just pool members at the club now   michael yeah its a real shame  whats going on with this family  youre stuck by the pool and  dads getting picked last for softball  nonetheless you can free up a little  company money to get back our golf privileges  no i cant mom you dont even play golf  no but i use the clubhouse dining  room until i was turned away today   its embarrassing  take it back   woman gasps  if i wanted something your thumb  touched id eat the inside of your ear  you should see the looks im getting  if you cant free up the cash have  your father call the club president  ive got news for you mom im  not visiting dad in jail anymore    gasps  no ive had it  im down there every single day trying to do  what i can to get this company back on track  and he barely even acknowledges me  that is disgusting  talk to your father i will not stand for this      groans  gob  can i uh get you to stop doing that  im just setting up an office  gotta write a strongly worded  letter to one warden james buck   in order to restore  his career as an escape artist  gob had recently checked into  prison as a publicity stunt   you really think you can break out of my  prison   you wont even know i was here   but after a shiv to his side  gob was rushed to a local hospital   thus fulfilling in gobs mind his  contract with the  public   tadah  and yet the warden had refused to  acknowledge the legitimacy of the escape  so i am going after this guy  with everything ive got  art  now we are writing a letter  gob  i wish i wouldve known  you were coming i am a mess  dont know if a call from  me wouldve changed that   snickers do you like my outfit  not as much as i like whats underneath it  gob  no i need your chair get  up ive got a letter to write  whoo youre all business  just like your dad   mutters my god shes repulsive   michael realized that  kittys obvious attraction to gob  could perhaps be of use to him  how would you like a touch lamp  youre the one who needs therapy  meanwhile lindsay and tobias prepared  for their first session with a therapist  yes tobias i want the marriage to work  i just dont know if therapy is the answer  because you didnt respect my old career  and you certainly dont respect my new one  you dont have a new one   things had been tense since  tobias left his psychiatry practice  to pursue an acting career   i have needs  you know  and  how i am not addressing your needs   how can you even ask that what  is this  oh  go right to that  good go right there real mature really great  okay kids mommy and daddy  are going

the very notion of prison  since as a young boy he  accidentally watched hbos oz  mistaking it for the classic judy garland musical    im an innocent  man   eat it bitch   lots of times  whats it like  you know what you should do you  should go get your moms date book  oh yeah she must have  written down where theyre going   i still wanna hear about  prison okay   if you can handle it     michael arrived home in a good mood  with gob getting the information from kitty  he would no longer have to visit  prison and deal with his father  hey buddy came home early  wanna do somethin anything

yes all right   sighs   michael headed back to the prison  despite his earlier vow never to return   you always say family  first i should see my grandpa right  im not stopping you its just  after this im not going back there  why is it scary  scary no no  its the opposite of scary its like a carnival  without the halfperson on the skateboard  that grabbed your knee to steady himself  its like a country club all the guy does  is eat ice cream and play softball all day   in fact george sr s  softball game had taken most of the day  it was the 14th inning and  tensions were running a little high  ill give you a thousand bucks you call the  next one a strike my knees are killing me   no batter no batter here   strike three  strike three my ass     ohh   down in the yard    no batter no no

carjacker   aaah  well shes  certainly toughened up since then  shes eating lunch by the pool now  theres a big difference between the  country club pool and the conjugal trailer  thats not what i meant when i said visit  its too bad i really  miss that personal contact  it was the one thing that  calmed me when i got stressed  it just felt humanizing   michael for the first time  saw his father as a vulnerable human being   whimpers daddy horny michael  i just havent had sex in a month  youve been here two months  its hard to gauge time   yeah ill bet   clears throat     hey mom  i

middlemedium hug  its hard to tell sometimes  that was a good hug thats plenty for now  hugs gotta end sometime obviously   soon michael was  driving lucille to prison  and she seemed to be looking forward to it  where are we going after   hey dad  michael  what are you doing here  you needed my help and it was hard for you  to ask so i took it upon myself to bring her   that doesnt make you  uncomfortable   the  drive was a little awkward  not every son would do this for his father  thank you for this   hello george  what the hells your mother doing in here   who were you expecting   oh

delivering this  strongly worded letter i wrote  lit by nothing but natural light  well how would you like that  touch lamp and the office  and what the hell full use of the secretary  thank you for

appreciated my body  can i help it if youve got a fantastic body  and youre as powerful as a bear  my husband the bear  this bear needs some honey wife  oh god i missed you  gasps groans   gob meanwhile stalled  to keep kitty in the other trailer  glasses off  glasses on  hair up  glasses off  down on have we done up off   oh gob this is so wrong  and bright  wrong aand bright  this  thats be brighter  god damn  im just gonna wash up real quick  uh i think im gonna go  with with down and off   gob had to do the right thing  but as he headed to his  car he ran into the warden  who hadjust read his strongly worded letter  well if it isnt sincerely yours  and so gob was detained  against the window of the trailer   his parents were  becoming  intimate in     sobbing oh god mommy what did you do   hey buddy  hey where were you  i had to help out your grandfather  and then i had to vow that i would  never help your grandfather again  pretty much a normal day for me  how are you doing  im fine i guess its just  you think of prison as this place full of  guilty people and it  doesnt bother you that much  but if poppop could be  there then anybody could be there  and i dont wanna go to prison  dad i dont think i could take it  i know i act tough but l  is this what youre worried about  cause i got news  hes uh hes guilty  he is  oh yeah  incredibly guilty   george michael exhales  on the next arrested development  tobias talks lindsay into another session  ive decided that   sighs i want to become an actor too    laughs  and george sr makes good  on his promise to come clean  on the international accounts  theres a good chance that l that i may  have committed some um  light treason   groans
