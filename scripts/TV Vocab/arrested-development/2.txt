but  for your  information i did go shopping  you spent 68 on hair conditioner  a small price to pay for selfesteem michael  or are you still jealous that you lost best  hair to me in high school and got dorkiest   lindsays  achievements in high school  had always overshadowed michaels  i agree with michael its  important not to tie your selfesteem  into how you look or what people think of you  i mean look at me im an actor  an actor for crying out loud  you know how much rejection i face every day  but in this business of show  you have to have the heart of an angel  and the hide of an elephant  but youve never actually had an audition   chuckles  well   imitating steve martin excuse me  excuse me  some really great spousal  support you know something lindsay  you might wanna start thinking about the  example youre setting for your daughter  unless you want her to end up just like you  yeah shoot me when that happens  is there a carbon monoxide leak in this house  george michael youre  taking your cousin to work today  thats your new employee i do not want my  niece to end up just  like everyone in this family  uhuh youre not telling my  daughter what to do shes a child  no

not be afraid to ride her hard   george michaels  attempt to distance himself  from his cousin proved unsuccessful  i cant tell you how many health  codes youre violating right now  i cant believe i volunteered for this  this is my stupidest rebellion ever  hey do you wanna go play skeeball      wait this is the cash drawer  my dads gonna come by at  the end of the weekend  and the number of bananas has to  match the amount of money in here  oh so it all has  to even out   exactly  easy banana  buck  banana take a buck   and michael went to  his mother for the flight records  his father wouldnt give him  then why dont you marry an ice cream sandwich   i gotta go  who was that was that dad   that was gob  uhhuh   so mom im trying to  find   i dont  know where they are  these flight records  you know its really more  believable if you let me finish  why am i the only one that seems to  get how much trouble this family is in  oh i get it michael i get it  but how should i know where the records are  kept your fathers in charge of all that  no im in charge of all of that  and i think that you do know where they are  oh its probably all in a storage unit somewhere  where is the storage unit   i dont remember  try  something with dale i dont know brookfeather  raintree its hot its very hot there   ive never been get a  warrant   dont think i wont  mother mother i care about this family  and i do too my darling  thats why im worried about gob i  was on the phone with him this morning  you mean just now right when i came in  yes just now when you came in  and hes upset hes very upset   you havent included him in  the business at  all   scoffs  hes your older brother you  could find a little job for him   make him feel special   but hes not special mother  no  but he loves you we all love you   wheres the storage  unit  its  with your warrant    luz that coat cost more than your house  oh thats how we joke she  doesnt even have a house   the next day tobias looked for work  hmm actor pull  ooh  oh look at all these parts  tobias nice to see you off the couch  i was looking for work and  i blew it michael   i guess youve already seen that huh  yes i have oh right this one  yeah ill call them again i guess  ill give them one more shot   and thats when michael  figured out how to get his mother  to lead him to the storage unit  where the flight records were kept    hello   hey mom its michael listen  before i forget i talked to the ir s  and they wanna come by your apartment today  to see if you charged any  bigticket stuff to the company  furs or  i dont know just a headsup  oh that poor woman   so michael followed luz  who had been sent to hide the evidence  meanwhile tobias had arranged an  audition for a local commercial  lindsay came along to appear supportive   this could take a while  honey its one line  not if i do my job right  first of all i love it quick question though  am i panicked about the fire or  am i being brave for everyone else  the fire its its a fire sale  oh oh  chuckling  okay i didnt um  well lets give it a shot   deep breath  oh my god were having a fire sale  oh the burning it burns me  evacuate all the schoolchildren     singing this isnt a  fever   singing continues  i cant even see where the knob is   grunts sighs  and scene  um  would you like to try that a little simpler maybe  no  okay anybody else anyone  lindsay bluth   its fnke  roger danish  look at you i cant believe its lindsay bluth   oh  fnke  roger was my male counterpart in high school  remember how crazy our hair was back then  what were we thinking so what are you doing now  hes uh casting  my commercial   oh  yeah trying to the south coast  boutique is having a fire sale  south coast boutique theyre having a fire sale   meanwhile michael was  still following his mothers housekeeper  and she did finally lead him to the storage unit   unfortunately it was  on fire   siren wailing    somebody wanted this place to go  yeah what do you mean arson  oh definitely the work of a flamer   shouting  it shoots tomorrow and are you ready for this   it pays 1000  bucks  mmm i  thought that was tobiass part  yes no no i did not book this one  i uh i think i made the  uh fire too real uh for them  and uh and probably  failed to highlight the sale  so good for her and uh  will you excuse me please   chuckling  well thats great but ive got my own problems  the flight records they burned up  thats fine thats over with  but i think dad is behind it  i think dad is trying to  run the business from prison  well isnt that ironic im  making a fortune at my newjob  and you dont even have  the job you thought you did  but you dont have a job youve got a  job offer anybody can get a job offer   sobbing  so im gonna go see dad  because this is my business to run now  your business  hey there you are gob  i have been looking all over for you  i could really use some help  well i was gonna return this dove  what are you you want me to  run a meeting for you or something  or even better could  you mail this letter for me  you cant just give that to a mailman  i cant trust a mailman  with this this is important   gob was  intrigued he also suspected  he couldnt return a  completely frozen dove to a pet store  and get the full refund  he felt he was entitled to   ill mail that  letter    michael then went to confront his father  you are not going to keep  running the company from in here okay  thats why you wanted me to give tbone a job   to pay him back for burning down the  storage unit   michael thats ridiculous  well im not hiring him no  we dont have the money pop  theres always money in the  banana stand  clicks tongue  the banana stand you know thats  exactly what this feels like huh  like im still stuck in that hot booth  all summer with you pulling the strings  what was i gonna do put a kid in  charge of a frozen banana stand  sure thats what i did i  just made my son the manager  george michael is running  the frozen banana stand now  thats right yeah you sit with  that you think about that for a while   george sr did think about that  well now that weve got an  employee we can go have dinner  we throw away a banana for every  buck we take so no one finds out  wait a minute i think you  should do that math again   why is it wrong  its fine   hes an arsonist not an  embezzler    no audible dialogue   meanwhile michael  got an urgent call from his mother  gob is unhappy  again i tried to include him i gave him a job  you gave him a letter to mail  dont tell me that was too much for him  no michael he mailed the  letter thats not the point   gob had not mailed the  letter but in an act of defiance  dramatically hurled the letter into the sea     this proved a more difficult  dramatic gesture than hed anticipated      so what do you want me to do  about it   dont take that tone   hes my son i want you to make  him stop calling  me    am i the only one who works in this family   yes thats my gal  who would have imagined two  actors in one family  chuckles  were like the lunts   chuckling you see excuse me   mama   and so lindsay and maeby  separately went to the same restaurant  to celebrate thejobs they  hadnt actually performed  with money they hadnt actually earned  did you enjoy your meal  mom you drank it fast enough    hi lucille  not  as much as you enjoyed yours  you want your belt to buckle not your chair  okay this is what i told tobias youd do  say what you will about him  at least hes happy for me   sobbing  you know i think we might  be doubling our losses here  because i mean for every dollar you  take youre actually taking two dollars  because we paid for the bananas   chuckles oh my god youre right  i am oh god ive screwed  this up okay we gotta go   oh my god its your mom and  gangy  what  are they doing here  theyre grownups theyre  allowed to have fun whenever they want  were kids were supposed to be  working now theyre gonna tell my dad  and hes gonna come check the  totals and know we took the money   oh god this is bad  what are we gonna do  look  poppop hes a  business man what would he do  bananas foster  you might wanna let that fire go  out before you stick your face in it  thats funny cause i was gonna say  you might wanna lean away from that fire  since youre soaked in alcohol  mine was better  mine was better  welcome to bluth bananas  where bananas are our business  may i interest you in a banana this day   tbone what are you doing  here  your dad  gave me this job   michael realized that  his father had even taken control  of the banana stand  but he still had some unanswered questions  so he did a little detective work   you burn down the storage  unit  oh most definitely  michael having a nice day at the beach  while the rest of us are busting  our asses to deliver your mail  what do you want me to say  you go and complain to mom   and i tried to include you  include me   yeah  i should be in  charge im the older brother   please do you even wanna be in  charge   no but  id like to be asked  this is just like when we were  kids and you were the only one   he let work in the banana  stand  well i  got news for you  dad still doesnt trust me to this day  he treats me like a lowlevel employee   scoffs better than being  treated like the goofball  the joker the magician  i thought you were gonna do like a trick there   a fireball or something   i was it didnt go off   these things never go off when  you want them  to     my least consistent  trick  hang  on one sec hello   hey uncle michael its me  maeby   wheres george michael  at the banana stand hes about to  do something really irresponsible  you think its  irresponsible ill be right there   im gonna get blamed for  this    george michael   dad  hey what are you doing  i was just uh i was  burning down the banana stand  what   im  sorry i screwed it all up  ive got no right to call myself mr manager   manager  manager im sorry dad   oh george michael  i  am but ill make it up to you  ill work weeknights  ill lay people off  ill give up my summer all my summers  just just tell me what to do and ill do it   michael realized he had done to  his son what his father had done to him  so he came up with a solution   burn it down  what  lets burn this son of a bitch  this is gonna be our best summer ever buddy   and so michael his son  and his brother together enjoyed  the cathartic burning of the banana stand  you mailed that insurance check right gob         the next morning  lindsay woke up late in the day  hungover from celebrating  her one day of employment  which it turns out she had slept through   roger all right lindsay  forget it well get someone else    tobias was next  on the call  list     but unfortunately couldnt  hear the phone     over the sound of the  shower    he did however use lindsays conditioner   and was surprised to find that it  did help his  selfesteem  mornin   you look nice  what  you look very handsome today  thank you lindsay   and michael finally  got to show his father whos boss  you what   burned it right down to the ground  are you crazy there was  money in that banana stand  well its all gone now  dad and it was my decision  so the next time you wanna  have a little power struggle  just remember that youre playing with fire  there was 250000 lining  the walls of the banana stand   what  cash michael   why didnt you tell me that   how much clearer can i say   shouting theres always  money in the banana stand   no touching no touching  no touching   no touching no touching  no touching  on the next arrested development  gob protests the pet stores  frozen dove exchange policy  return from whence you came  and michael realizing the banana stand  is the only profitable part of the  bluth empire decides to rebuild  you couldnt have called  me i cant swing a hammer   i got a rabbit to buy   engine revs
