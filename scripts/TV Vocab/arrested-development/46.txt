                now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything  and the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together  its arrested development  michael was sharing some very important news with his parents  i am getting married  who the hell to  who do you think rita  her  why  well first of all she needs a green card to stay in the country  there it is  she needs a green card to stay in the country because secondly  were really crazy about each other  you hardly know her  i know all the important stuff she was in the olympics  shes sweet shes smart shes beautiful shes special  she was special  are houses terribly hard to make  actually the hardest part is finding the land  but she wasnt smart  instead of making houses maybe you should make land  for rita had only mentally progressed  on the ocean  to the level of a first grader  theres no land on the ocean  michael might have noticed her disability  if it had not been masked by her english accent  youre brilliant  yeah she wasnt  i know shes a really really good person and everything else  is going to be little surprises along the way  with the exception of that one big one  the wedding  is in one month  a month  all right now look just because a woman gets pregnant  doesnt mean you have to marry her  too many lives have been ruined because some cheap waitress  at a hojo said she used an iud  it was stuckeys  but i believed you  shes not pregnant truthfully we havent even slept together   this is funny  hes gay  wheres your hand  oh im having my high school ring put on it and my hook is stuck in the staircar  domo arigoto mister roboto  do you think getting married will solve your sex problem  no and we dont have a problem  we just havent had the right opportunity yet  lindsay said rita slept over last night  yes but i gave her the bedroom because i didnt want her to feel pressured  actually it was michael who felt a little pressured  and i like to keep the light on  that way i can see if you have a monster  nightnight  can you shut the door on your way out  i cant believe youre not supporting this  because it is obvious what shes after  our money  oh god our money  lets just all relax and remind ourselves that we dont have any money  shes already gotten our money  lets not forget shes the one that gave us the idea  for that oceantop town called bluthton  oh big deal i had that same basic idea years ago  i thought youd be happy and i should have known better  michael be careful  people just see what they want to see  if she loved you shed show it  michael was worried  his mother may have been making sense  so he returned home to talk to rita  ah here comes the bride  hey what are you doing in a wheelchair  no no no its a dolly to help videotape your nuptials  i dont think i need any footage of my nuptials  tobias are you sure that this dolly isnt related to your recent health problems  okay so my legs and my left arm occasionally go to sleep  and you want to call it a health problem  hey hey hey hey  no i can get up myself  here we go  let me get in the dolly  no thank you i dont need your help  it does seem like youve been having a whole lot of trouble since the hair transplants  maybe you should see a bubuman  a bubuman  oh uh a doctor  its a british expression like they say goup box instead of elevator  oh like when they say poofter to mean tourist yes  boy that ritas a smarty  true but its not like anybody appreciates it mom and dad do not like rita  are they crazy  shes amazing  i saw her last night and she helped with this little project i was doing  maeby was struggling with a screen play in her secret life as a film executive  is that a story  not yet it doesnt have an ending  hes in la shes in japan how do i get these two characters together  maybe they could walk  across the ocean  if its not too deep  no deep is good  people are going to say what the hell just happened i better say i like it  cause nobody wants to seem stupid  i like it  the ocean walker  holy crap thats going to look good on a hat  and michael caught up with his brother  pal i need a favor as you know im getting married in about a month  say no more  great are you sure that you know what  yup yup yup got it super  andand just so that were both clear  you want me to do a magic show at the wedding im on it  so glad we pushed through that  no magic  why because the one little screw up last time  put her out put her out  tracy  thank god we already did the pictures  which reminds me that rita shouldnt wear any hair spray at this thing  i just want you to be my witness  oh you want me to  be your best man  its just a signature i need on the license  my sons not old enough its no big deal  i will not take this sacred duty lightly  i am going to get you the single healthiest call girl that this town has ever seen  this is why im calling it a witness and not a best man  all you have to do is watch  oh im not going to spend this kind of money and not watch  this may have been a bad choice  hey hello well look at you two tweedle dee tweedle dum  michael didnt mean it in that way  how could he he didnt even know  we had the best time  shes got such an amazing fashion sense  you guys have these jackets on inside out  yeah that way you see the label  yeah i mean thats what youre paying for right its a great statement on fashion  plus it doesnt tickle your neck  michael took lindsay aside to share his concerns  so lindsay when did you first realize that you and tobias  had no chance at a physical relationship  oh my god do you think we have no chance at a physical relationship  just now  um see rita and i have not been physical yet and  you dont think that shes doing this just for a green card do you  no no shes not that kind of person  no you just havent been alone with her  ask her to stay over at a hotel with you tonight  shes going to know what that means  that is not a bad idea dont dont do that  and gob began to prepare a magic trick for michaels wedding  king takes his queen  and showers her with diamonds  clubs  club sauce  he covers her with club sauce  right thatll be my line if that happens  is that a magic trick  i love magic  i dont appreciate the dry british humor  please do a magic trick for me  well i shouldnt  id hate to be blamed for setting another one of michaels brides on fire  oh lighter fluidlike uncle trevor uses  but wherever did it come from  okay ive got to get you into an illusion at the wedding  how long can you hold your breath  oh long one time 20 minutes  actually her record was 20 seconds  you can stop it  okay ill take your word for it  now i just need to find a trick that puts you out of oxygen for 20 minutes  sorry did i hear the word trick  and it smells a lot like lighter fluid in here  you know i did say no tricks gob and i mean it  what if i find a trick that has her float to the alter or something  no no love for her to walk and not to drown  or fly through the air or catch on fire  is she allergic to cat fur  oop no tigers  right  so uh rita um  i was wondering if maybe you and i might head down to a hotel  maybe some alone time   oh yes  yeah  maybe our rooms could touch  well iii was hoping maybe for more than just our rooms to touch  i was thinking maybe we could be in the same room  be in the same bed  oh i see what you mean a real sleepover  well maybe  okay  really  well maybe i should go home and get my things i do kind of miss my jammies  i think theyre going to have a lot of that stuff there  and my tiny teddy  good yes get that  and so george michael drove rita to wee britain  its nice to be with someone young  we can listen to young peoples music for a change  great yeah please   hot potato hot potato  hot potato hot potato  thats when he first grew concerned  and rita packed for her sleepover  do you have any idea what a sleepover is  cause its not just sleep  i know what it is trevor ive seen your secret magazine  i want to have grownup fun  spoon and figgy pudding  rabbit downdum druggarys hollow  and i want to have poppop  well the very fact that you call it that tells me youre not ready  oh and for your information thats a cricket magazine  whether you like it or not youre still a child in many ways  ive got a problem with you having sexual relations with that man  so do i  i mean its not your fault your parents were cousins but here we are  now ive been charged with taking care of you and im bloody well going to do it  well michael will be my cousin soon enough cause were getting married   married  married  totally out of the question  married married married  all right that does it youre not going anywhere  im putting the invisible locks on the door  thats not fair   lock lock lock   thats not fair   its just not fair   lock lock  ive got to find a new hiding place for that magazine  and michael was waiting at the hotel  hey dad  just wanted to let you know that im at a hotel with my wifetobe  and were very very much in love  put her on  michael briefly considered faking the voice  i shes in the shower   ill wait  lets wait  unless you want me to just call you back or  no i have nowhere to go im under house arrest  lets watch something together  wow that blossom blew up huh  say hows that shower coming  all right look shes not in the shower  really  she said that shed meet me at the hotel and ii called you a little prematurely  but she is coming  really  hey put rita on  and thats when michael finally accepted that rita wasnt coming  and that local calls were 295 a minute  come on  thats where they get you  michael drove to wee britain to call off the wedding  that he now realized was not based on love  who is it  its michael rita can i come in  i cant let you in  you know you didnt show up last night  i think the least you can do is talk to me facetoface  i cant  trevor locked the door  he doesnt want me to be with you  what he locked the door you cant unlock this door  i cant even see half the locks   rita what  theyre invisible   trevors the only one who can see them  im trapped listen ive got an idea  go next to the window im gonna climb up  be careful  i will  and so michael set about rescuing the beautiful sweet mentally challenged woman  hed fallen in love with without realizing she was mentally challenged   yay michael yay  whats this   someone undid the locks  okay come on out   trevors back  oh fine come on hop on   what   hop on  ready  hey stop that both of you come back  you cant stop us  nothing can stop us now  nothing in the world of man nor beast nor time is  i hate that  bleep  doll  and so reunited with rita  michael told his parents hed be getting married tomorrow  well god help her if she tries to rename bluthton  ill sink it first  i swear ill sink the whole damn thing  theyre going through with it tomorrow  but thats when george and lucille had a surprise visitor  all right where the hell is rita  im her uncle  let the handouts begin  theres not gonna be any handouts and she is not gonna marry your son  youre against this marriage too  well of course i am  ritas not capable of making a decision like that  you are not gonna get ritas millions just because shes mentally challenged  millions  millions  mentally challenged  shh its not polite  she owns all of wee britain  and also the wee britain in cleveland  of course were probably gonna lose all that  if her ridiculous idea for sea britain goes through  we are not after her money  and i dont think michael even knows about her condition  yes its funny how americans dont pick up on that  i think its cause of her accent and the plastic surgery shes been able to afford  we wouldnt have this trouble if theyd met last year  i got to put a stop to this  were gonna search every bloody hotel in town  oh legoland   i think they said they were going to legoland  they did say legoland  i didnt hear anything about legoland  he doesnt know whats talking about  we think he may be mentally challenged  what  all right then  we have got 24 hours to get them married  before michael figures out what she really is  this the first time in two years youve sounded like george bluth  later that night michael was at the hotel with his bride to be  rita ive been really looking forward to this  me too  i want to have sexual relations  mere fact that you call it that tells me that you are ready  thats why i brought this  no  why dont you go ahead and whip out that tiny teddy  and then were gonna think up a fun safe word okay  george michael i did not know that you were  um go ahead and talk out here  we just got back from the bumpaddle courts tomorrow im teaching her baseball  yeah that may take a while  sorry  well listen dad ththis is hard for this is hard for me to say this  i was videotaping rita  lets just say it would be cute if it was someone much younger  im sorry we really should get another tape  i mean theyre not expensive  its the plastic fruit dad  its very convincing fruit okay  is she going back in for another  well you know they dont even have bananas in england okay son  now i know this is hard for you but it would be nice to be supported in some  oh no shes going into the grapes  yeah she really liked those  im sorry  i think she might be  retar retarded  im sorry  im really sorry  say hello to my tiny teddy  oh tiny teddy  and thats when it dawned on michael  oh you teach kids huh  oh i like to think they teach me  that way i can see if you have a monster  be careful  ive made a huge mistake  michael had just been shown that his fiance might be mentally challenged  but he needed proof  are you ready for lie down kisses with me  maybe we ought to just talk a little bit you know i mean what the heck  for instance youve never told me how many houses there are in the british parliament  seven  are there  the answer is three  does sound about right  three is the correct answer   come on   whoa whoa whoa whoa  lets have our fun  rita corny michael  so michael used a line that was just as corny  you know i think that we should wait until after were married  married  married married married  okay nightnight  and michael felt he deserved a 15 thing of candy beans  the next morning however as michael prepared to let rita down gently   he was met with another surprise  surprise  whats this  were throwing you a wedding  oh how lovely  on us  everything you see  show them the waffle bar larry  its over there  and check out banner michael  im gonna go set up  yeah you know ii was just gonna talk to rita about all of this  rita i think that we should um wait a little while  wait why i dont want to wait  i want to get married  and have sexual relations like you promised  where did you get this firecracker  i love her michael  so do i i want to kiss my new daughterinlaw  hey not on our time larry  right on the lips  no no dad please take it easy  im gonna go get my dress from the from the room  yes ill help you put it on inside out  letslets not all get um  hey mom whatwhats going on i thought that you guys were against all this  well we figured you know best and who are we to interfere and you love this girl  and the rest will just be little happy surprises along the way like you said  yeah with the exception of the retard thing  oh god  tell me you didnt just say that  you knew  you knew and yet you still wanted me to go through with this  what can i say  im crazy about the little dullard  oh my god  shes rich  this is a new low even for you mom  what is wrong with you  larry go to a mirror   youre fired  youre fired  what  its over  and this is how you tell me in the middle of a wedding  you shouldnt have said anything  so you were right now what am i gonna do  well ive been thinking you know i mean every society has their own rules about this stuff  for instance in some states its legal to marry your own cousin  californias blocked it twice  but thats only because they tacked it onto an estate law thing that wasnt gonna pass  we had the signatures  youre 16 and you know all that shes 30 and a half  she probably cant list the seven houses of parliament  theres three  now i got to break her heart  well doesnt she have to leave the country if you dont marry her  yeah i guess i can keep my promise about that huh  there wouldnt be any real intimacy andand it would be the strongest marriage in the family  but you know as much as id like to you cant ignore the fact  that she is mentally disabled  oh my god  im wearing an inside out bridesmaids dress  you better catch her dad  thats not gonna be easy shes an olympic silver  just figured that one out  okay well ill have to go stop production on the ocean walker  you found out  took me long enough  maybe youre not smart either  i didnt know until they told me  no im just a narcissist who was too selfinvolved to see the truth  that makes no sense to me  yeah maybe youre right maybe im being too hard on myself  you know the truth is is that i did just see what i wanted to see rita  youre so beautiful and youre so sweet  and you deserve to find somebody a lot more like you  i dont think that either of us would be happy  so its byebye to rita then  unless you really want to stay in america  i wanted to be with you  oy rita  time to go now  back to england love  oh michael will you come visit me lots  thats gonna be difficult rita youre gonna be across an ocean  well you can always walk  not on the water  oh michael youre such a grownup  hey hey  hang on a sec thats part of your trick right  no  thats not my trick michael  on the next arrested development  its my illusion  michael relives a wedding nightmare   oh put him out put him out  my hair my beautiful hair  push him in the pool  why am i not going under water  dear god why am i not going under water
