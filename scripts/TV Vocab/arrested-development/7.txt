mothers extravagant spending  hey mom remember we had that  conversation about trying to  cut back on things that arent necessities   like it was yesterday  it was this morning  and now i hear that

much as the  next guy mom but were not doing that  my neighbor lucille austero is  constantly throwing parties for herself   shes having another one in a  week  im not going to that   buster had been  avoiding lucille austero  since he accidentally flirted with  her while not wearing his glasses  and then accidentally bid on her  at a charity bachelorette auction   ten thousand dollars  buster  and then accidentally entered her  apartment thinking it was his mothers  i need you right now  gasps  fellas take a powder  oh here comes the 1015  conniption right on time  honest to god buster its like every  little thing makes you seize up in terror lately  i have no idea where you get that from  get away from that stove youre  going to light your hair on fire  hes weak  speaking of weak mom what  do you got in there gold bars  protein bars for your  father hes pumping up in prison  no more  parties okay mom  youre my third leastfavorite child  i can live with that   michael came home to find  his mothers fourth leastfavorite child  heard youre selling the yacht  yeah i had a couple in there this morning  yeah i know  well they got the asian right  hotties might be a stretch  well lets start with the little one   youre not staying on the yacht  are you  what  do you want me to do  live fulltime with marta   or break up with her  im sure thered be somebody else  out there that would appreciate her   in fact michael  felt that man was himself  he had become infatuated  with his brothers girlfriend  and was having difficulty  keeping his love a secret  you have 48 hours to vacate the yacht  guys ive got a great  idea i wanna throw mom a party  would you i just told mom no more parties  i know michael thats why this is the  perfect opportunity to  throw her a surprise party  shed never suspect it   is this her suggestion  no i just think its  important to honor your parents  why dont you start by visiting dad  in jail youve never even been there  michael do you have any idea what  would happen if i were to visit prison   hmm  it would be pandemonium   mmhmm  itd just give  dad one more reason to think  that ive got nothing to offer but my looks  yeah i got some of that  except he also didnt like my looks  okay michael i will go visit dad  if you drive mom to the  restaurant for the surprise party  ill just pretend that im  taking her out that evening   come on that would never  happen  she  cant drive herself   i mean shes the worlds worst  driver   lindsay  was not exaggerating  lucille had recently been  featured on foxs worlds worst drivers  yeah i cant believe she got  that drivers license renewed  she didnt i dummied her up a new one  not my best work though she wanted to look 48  i nearly airbrushed her into oblivion  we ended up checking albino on the form  come on michael who knows how long  our parents are going to be around  i gotta tell ya i was over at her  place today and she looked a little frail  she was having trouble even  lifting up this bag of groceries  all right we will do the surprise party   for gangy   yeah how did you know   she called and invited us   okay so it was her idea   we dont have to go do we  come on this is a bluth family  celebration its no place for children   and lindsay went to the  prison to visit her father for the first time  but didnt get the reception she was expecting  i wanna thank you for coming  here it took a lot of guts  the reason im here today is because  i felt that i needed to say something   oh okay  my whole life  all youve ever praised me for is my looks   oh no your looks  yes dad  i mean its always been  michaels got the brains  gobs got the charm busters got the   highfastening pants  have you said that  no im saying that now  so anyway look if youre  wondering why i havent visited  maybe its because i wanted to be  thought of as more than just a beautiful face  and a gorgeous head of hair   lindsay was surprised  once again that no heads were turned   scoffs  im gonna go shopping  ill be back tomorrow   george michael was  finally moving beyond his crush on maeby   george michael was  finally moving beyond his crush on maeby  and felt happy to have a cousin  he couldjust see a movie with   it was a love between two  cousins that the world thought was wrong   but it was the world that  was wrong    speaking french   we have got to see this  movie  excuse me kids  can i see your ids   and michael was driving  his mother to her surprise party  where on earth are we going  left at the next corner   you know michael  yeah  id be happy to drive if you want me to  its better than sitting here  with busters stupid rock behind me   buster had  recently brought the rock home  from an  archeological dig but had yet  to find a way to get it out of the car  mom youve already got  two strikes on your record  you strike one more person  and its technically a spree  are we going to the back  is this what i think it is   surprise    and she was surprised  that her family didnt show up   s  this is what my children think of me           where the  beeps was everybody  what are you  talking about  moms party where were you guys  its the first ive heard about it   what about you neimans  prison  then neimans but only because im going  back to prison and theyve seen me in this  buster you of all people where were you buddy  you barely even leave moms apartment   in fact buster was  worried about running into lucille 2  so he never left his mothers apartment  lucille 2 was also supposed to go but  was waiting until she saw buster emerge  tonight mother was humiliated  and i wanna throw her another  surprise party a real one  one where shes not the one  thats yelling surprise   mom yelled  surprise  yeah  she went from giddy to devastated  i mean it wouldve been funny if it wasnt so  well it was kind of funny  what frail act got you this time michael  she couldnt open a jar what did a  clump of her hair come out in your hands    laughs  no it was  something that she said at dinner  its dry  you know mom im sorry  youre upset but you know  if you were nicer then maybe your kids  would take better care of you you know  oror wanna be with you more  ive been a horrible mother  no mom youre great  youve been a great mother   well you know shes been a horrible  mother right  you  dont have to tell me  but what was i gonna say  all

got in a car accident on  the way back from her birthday party   man i told him not to let her  drive  no it  was him driving  shes taking good care of him too  she wont even let him use the phone   so youre telling me that he cant go  anywhere and hes  incommunicado   right   thats when gob decided to take  the yacht to south america for the summer  i gotta alert this boats crew  theyll be devastated   lindsay put on her  new outfit and returned to prison  back at lucilles michael was  still piecing together the accident   hey buster  hey brother   dr miller  yeah  i just jumped through a plate  glass window on a date  laughs  oh well women love to laugh  it was worth it to be away  from moms controlling grasp  buster whats going on  what happened to your head  nothing gob was just teaching  me how to hit it with a hammer  gob was there  gob was on his scooter   gasps i think i wanted to hit gob  yes that is exactly what  happened you wanted to give gob a scare  i dont know why  i think i do  thanks mom   george sr was once  again being visited by his daughter  thats it i dont  want you cant i dont  please you gotta stop coming here  it is obvious im not wearing a bra right  i cant take this anymore i um uh  im paying far too big a price for this  well what about me this is  the third time ive come here   i havent even been remotely  harassed   that is  not what im paying for  have i lost it did i ever even have it  im paying thousands of dollars in krugerrands   what  gold krugerrands  your mother snuck em in here  stuffed in energy bar wrappers  to keep me from getting  strangled in the shower or worse   stabbed  in a way  i used them to pay off the other guys  to stop them from hollering  obscenities at my my little girl  but you keep coming back  here honey and im going broke  thats all i ever wanted from you daddy  for you to spend money on me   no touching  gob i want you to move back on to the yacht  the yacht what makes you think id want to now  well i know that youve been looking for     what was that  i think that was on your end  the truth is i can wait on selling  the yacht its just money right  wow how hard did you hit that steering wheel   i actually hit the back of my  head  the back of your head  yeah gob the accident only happened because  i was trying to scare you   maybe even hurt you   that doesnt sound like you  it sounds like mom  can we please just lay off mom for a change  shes the one that helped me remember  what happened im the bad guy here not her  and definitely not you so  would you please just take the yacht  ill think about it  south america sounds good  but a chance to expose mom   turn this skiff around   we havent even left the dock  but skiff is appropriate right   gob rushed to  shore to spare his brother  from what he was certain  were his mothers machinations    michael what are you  doing  hey open this door   youve been set up  michael  theres no way you were trying  to hurt me you dont hate me  mom hates me you kind of like me   yeah i kind of like you  yeah   michael i  need your help   coming   ow i got hit back there  right  on the back of the head which means that  you couldnt have hit the steering wheel  mom must have clubbed you with a  champagne bottle or something so she could drive  gob howd you  figure it out  its funny you should ask that  no he didnt figure anything out  i probably got hit on the back of  the head because of busters rock   hey big shot    which was behind the passenger seat  which means that she picked you up and  dragged you over to the drivers seat  mom cant pick me up she could  barely pick up that bag of protein bars  guess what they werent protein bars  they were gold krugerrands and dad  finally paid attention to my intellect    lucille open this door  gob this is nuts   mother is frail   clattering   stop this nonsense this  instant  you  set him up mom  i was halfway to south america but i  couldnt let you get away with it  because were brothers mom  and we kind of like each other   you were going to south  america  i dont think so  mom you and i were getting along so  well i was thinking so highly of you  how could you make me think this was all my fault  because if you knew it was my  fault you wouldve turned against me  and i had finally gotten you on my  side you were sticking up for me  li dont even remember  you ever doing that before  i just want my children to love me  stop lying stop manipulating just be nicer  but  youre right  im a horrible mother   no no mom youre great  thats crazy talk   youre a  fantastic mother  i  cant believe what im hearing mother  oh we do we really love you   on the next arrested development  george michael and maeby sneak  back into les cousins dangereux  excuse me youre too young  to be holding that ticket   lets go  i cant go to jail   lets just watch  cartoons  sir we  will not be starting with les cousins   until you  leave  excuse me  but i thought my aarp card  was good for one  and a guest   you kno  what i knew society would never accept this   and they never  will    michaels insurance takes another hit   grunts    groans ow    rock  i was definitely driving that time
