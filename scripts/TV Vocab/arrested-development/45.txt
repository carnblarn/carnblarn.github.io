                its arrested development  michael had snuck out of work to see a british film with his british girlfriend rita  i hate it when they hire yanks to play brits you can always tell  when they came upon a toy store  we should get george michael one of these  oh no thats not really him  besides i already got him his big present for his birthday  a suit  dad its a jack welch  i want you to look under the pants  quicken premier  dad i hope you kept the receipt  you want to return that  what no i want to deduct it  oh come on lets get him the train  its really he would only like it for the receipt and this is crazy  i really i cant be seeing movies in the afternoon and then go into toy stores  i have to work im not even supposed to be here  michael couldnt tear himself away  could you  i cant promise itll be fun  okay that was fun  still the land probably shouldnt have given out underneath us  but weve got a mole problem  a mole problem  yeah theyve undermined this whole hill  and we probably wont be able to build on it for a few months  but its my own fault this is exactly why i should have been coming to work  the japanese backers if they find out about this that we havent started building  they might not come through with their investments  i wont tattle  i really fancy you  i fancy you too  michael was falling for rita  whoo  and rita was falling for michael too  but that wasnt part of the plan  rita  youve dirt on your face  its from school  i called the school and you werent there  you know were here to learn things not to fall in love  well so what if i have  ive got feelings all right im a woman too  not some robot you get to tell everything to im sick of it  im sick of it all  your instructions and your letters  and your little missions and your stupid assignments  you do the math rita well no you do the math  oh god  do you remember this  and the pledge that you made when you were promised it  i said id do anything for it  i want him out of the picture can you do that  im a big girl  and michael returned home as well  hey what happened to you  oh i got highlights  itll blend in in about a week  yeah i actually meant the collapse  oh i dont know  it probably has something to do with the 4000 hair plugs i had in one sitting  maybe you ought to see a doctor  yeah but hes too busy going to the gym to see his friend frank  oh were more than friends  im kind of his spotter  you missed a spot  anyway we should be looking at some big yen coming in from the japanese  and when it does im taking my gym buddy out to dinner  i barely even know you  whos frank  well ive been wanting to talk to you about that but its a little awkward  oh well  ive been wanting to have my own awkward talk as well  i think we can be more than just gym buddies  youre blowing my mind frank  im an agent and id like to work with you  oh oh  well this is great news okay good  im so glad you went first what agency are you with  frank said cia a government agency that was responsible for this catastrophe  but tobias thought he said caa  a talent agency which was responsible for this one  franks in the business michael  hes got a big project for me says its top secret  he kind of looks like you same size same curly hair  well tobias maybe you should spend less time focused on your looks  and a little bit more time focused on your daughter okay  her grades are terrible shes going to start getting fs  actually she had already gotten one  as the movie shed released in her secret life as a studio executive was losing money  but maeby had a way to fix that  we turn it into a ride  a ride  on the studio tour  what used to be the hell tunnel now becomes  the tunnel of love indubitably  but didnt some people die in hell tunnel  that is an urban legend  two elderly people got badly scalded when they tried to climb into the lava cauldron  but ive got that covered  theyre just like the poster  grades like those shes going to be taking tickets at a movie theater the rest of her life  you know youre one to talk  youve completely ignored this family since that british bird flew into your life  no i havent  well maybe a little  but you know shes amazing  you know she was in the olympics  she wasnt  shes that rita leeds  wasnt she on the cover of newsweek  no  yes  michael was thinking of this man  she even plays the banjo  although i do have to spend more time at work  i was at the property the japanese funded today  and the whole backside has moles  yeah thats franks problem too  later that day michael went into the office to find the rest of his family  well look whos finally gracing us with his presence  whats a surrogate doing here  were meeting with the lawyers  so ive hired this guy to be my eyes and ears  you know dad this guy costs us a fortune  hes worth every penny  hey i didnt say that   oh michael  mr loblaw  ill catch you up the japanese are coming  they are  somebody tipped them off that the property wasnt ready for building  which it would have been if michael hadnt been so busy with his  english muffin   typical  delicious  i need a drink  ill take an english muffin  well just have to be honest with these japanese investors  they uh come from a culture that values honor and respect  and godzilla  godzirra  godzirra  this needs to stop now  this is exactly what we shouldnt do when they show up   mom thats enough  what   were out of vodka  sorry  thought you were doing godzilla  mom thats enough  what im laughing  okay maybe thats it  maybe we should do to the japanese what they do in their movies  build a miniature city put it outside the window  tell them its far away itll look real if you squint  god knows theyre squinters  what do you think dad  a whole tiny town  another brilliant idea einstein  really  youd like to build it with me  larry really never knows how to sell the sarcasm  its a stupid idea  uh ill build it with you gob  oh great thats another brilliant idea steinberg  i agree with michael  if you take money from these people under false pretenses youll be committing fraud  the governments already watching your father pretty closely  theyre going through his mail  they want to put your father in prison for good  yeah bobs right weve got to start thinking practically  life is not some cheesy japanese movie  where the hero pulls on a pair of jet pants  and flies off the balcony like astro boy  and thats when george sr did a web search for the words jet pants  even better  the bigger problem is who alerted the japanese  i think you might have a spy  this room or someone in it might even be wired with a listening device  and you need to find that leak and plug it  your father said that he was set up by a british syndicate  maybe you should look for somebody english  what  i think michaels already plugged our leak  what is that supposed to mean  youve been spending a lot of time with rita and shes britishish  shes a spy  i havent told rita anything  this was not strictly true  lets start with my familys misdemeanors  and then were going to push right on through to the lighter treasons  the japanese backers if they find out about this that we havent started building  they might not come through with their investments  then he siphoned off the entire pension fund into a dummy corporation  filed for bankruptcy and used  do you know any other songs  shes a spy  rita is not a spy okay shes a beautiful elegant woman  it doesnt make sense  what doesnt make any sense is why shes dating you  no thats a good point  actually my sources tell me that the leak goes by the name mr f  ah mr f  ritas not a man  as far as you know  and it could be an alias  alias is a show about a spy  all right thats it i finally find someone that i really care about  my family tries to drive us apart its not going to work  so you know what i got a switch for you  you guys handle this problem i am going to go have some fun  unbelievable  deserting the family when we most need him  shameful  gob im sending you a package youll know what to do with it  michael was upset  and he called rita  hello  hey ive been thinking  im going to start working less and i do want to start having more fun  so id like to take you out tomorrow  all day anywhere you want what do you say  hell tunnel takes another name  will it take another life  oh i say yes  only im going to take you out  the next morning michael was heading out for his day with rita   george michael  i love my present dad  id wear it to school but who needs a welch wedge right   thats when they  enough business  in fact i got you another present its something i saw yesterday when i was out with rita  its time for us to start having some fun  i dont know fun and failure both start out the same way  well lets just go ahead and rip this down hmm  and larry the surrogate showed up to pick up the jet pack  that george sr had sent to the model home  what is that a train set  look down larry  no not down at your feet  left  my left your right  what is the matter with this guy and let me guess hes probably  saying all that too  it is a train set those japanese sites   im never going to find my way  past that hallway sensor  dad what are you doing here  is this the package you sent me  tiny town  this is for tiny town isnt it  you did like my idea didnt you dad  i think hes in the can  actually george sr was in the kitchen  trying to soothe himself with an ice cream sandwich  and thats when he discovered a way to possibly slip by the sensors  if mother sees this she will blow a cow  uhoh  dad  oh cool a train set  oh ive always wanted one of those  maybe we could build our tiny town together  do you want to dad  buster had always wanted to do the same with gob  goody yeah i do want to  yay i do want to goody  gob was thrilled as was buster  only larry was disappointed  but he was such a pro youd never know it  and back at the gym tobias was finding out more  about the project the agent had suggested  come on what are you gonna tell me what do you got for me  the japanese investors you told us about are going over to your place today  i need you there when they are  we need you to be a mole  oh kind of a backers audition okay i get it all right  well then frank i shall be a bigger hairier mole than the one on your inner left thigh  and later michael and rita were on the tantamount studios tour  he doesnt understand about bovine sponge  hold hold tram lets get out of here folks  make some room make some room  look its malcolm in the middle  in the middle of shooting i guess  oh thats okay its more important to show  how we make the show than to actually make it   bleep  tantamount  hello  hey dad they just dropped off the package you sent but i dont think im old enough  of course you are i told you i want you to have a little fun  youre not gonna break anything  but of course michael thought he was talking about the train set  not the extremely dangerous jet pack the boy had just found at the front door  well what if i crash it  thats half the fun  and soon the tour arrived at the tunnel of love indubitably  so take the hand of someone you love  as we enter the tunnel of love indubitably  tunnel of hell  but michael was happy to hold the hand of someone he did love  and then he noticed her bracelet  michael had just noticed that rita was wearing a suspicious bracelet  what does your bracelet say  nothing  oh look look there they are on the bicycle made for two  says mr f doesnt it who is he  nobody i cant tell you  oh god he followed us  wait a minute you know that man  its not what you think it is hes my uncle  is that mr f what does he want  he wants you out of the picture  bloody right i do  hey hey  you lied to me rita  you made me turn against my family but its over now  oh me  bleep  are wet  and maeby received a call about the latest lava cauldron accident  already its only been an hour  im going to lose this job  maybe i should let mort take me out to dinner  maeby  okay im definitely gonna lose this job i can explain  rita set me up set us all up  this beautiful funny brilliant woman was a spy  everybody was right it was too good to be true and i am turning her in  let me tell you something else  i would not want to be the next woman who tries to fool me  well that was a freebie  george michael meanwhile was trying to solve a mystery of his own  the jet pack had come with an instructional dvd  that seemed to confuse more than clarify  what was clear was that the gift was extremely dangerous  and it did seem like a lot of work  for a little pay off   have fun  have fun  meanwhile gob was bonding with the man he thought his father was controlling  almost done with the water tower  neato  his real father however had gotten lost within the walls  where the hell am i  he was actually somewhere between the linen closet and the guest room  you know im really glad that were doing this together  ive never felt so close to you  oh i feel the same way  hes crying now  god look at us  were like a couple of girls on the last day of camp  and right outside the house  tobias was working with the man he thought was a talent agent  you ready  oh yes im going to be a great mole  check two three  let lily lick lionels lusty leathers  the levels are fine  remember no one can know its you we need to capture george sr  capture george sr  is that what you hired me to do  you didnt realize that  no  but it does make perfect sense i have played him before  he had in the poorly narrated reality series scandalmakers  its gonna be tough to work that into the character  and its going to fight the costume i rented  but i didnt take six weeks of improv classes at the groundlings for nothing  and michael was on the phone to bob loblaw  i dont even think shes here legally all right  shes taken advantage of me i want you to take care of this  call the cia do whatever you have to do  fine but you take care of your family  i think theyre going ahead with this hoax  and if money changes hands youre all going to jail  unfortunately the roads are out so we cant take you up there to see it in person  but if you stand absolutely still right there and just  squint into the light and behold sudden hill  gob dont  it actually looked pretty good  even the financiers thought so  ishiro said i am reassured and they treat us with respect this time  motoyoshi said i thought the woman was pretending as a monster  but she was just out of vodka  lets go ahead and close the curtains and not accept any money while were ahead  so as you can see any rumor of a mole problem is completely untrue  but unfortunately this was just as tobias appeared in his rented mole outfit   no the village  families should come ow  ow  im very particular about building codes  and this water tower does not pass muster  who can save our village  as it turns out it was george michael who had finally gotten his grandfathers jet pack to work  i cant stop this thing  youre blowing my audition  i ache with embarrassment  the japanese were never to be heard from again  okay whats going on here  okay thats no surprise  george michael  dad im sorry i cant fly it very well  i think i really would rather have the welch  i didnt buy you that i bought you the train set which you guys just destroyed  did you keep the receipt  what is that  feedback is someone else wired  oh thats me my friend frank wired me  he wanted me to be a mole   our covers blown  lets get out of here  goodbye tobias  he wanted you to be a mole  oh my god tobias funke youre mr f  which means that man was ritas uncle what have i done  i have to get this suit back  they destroyed our town but they cant take away our memories  oh ive had the time of my life  i think hes being sarcastic gob  no im not mother  i mean lover  i like making love to mother  i mean lover  oh my god buster is that you  yes  gob its just i wanted to spend some time with you  thats all  and you enjoyed it you cant deny that  i guess youre right  maybe we should spend more time together  oh id really like that  its weird  it took some idiot parrot man with a camera in his hat to bring us together  but even a pro like larry has a breaking point  rita  what do you want i have to pack  pack where are you going  someone called the bobbies on us  oh no  my uncle and i have to go back to big britain  oh that was me rita im so so sorry  i didnt know what was going on  why did your uncle threaten me  he thought you might be trouble  that was actually very astute of him  goodbye michael  you know i really did fancy you   i cant stay here now  marry me   what  let me marry you  you can get a green card stay here and we can see if this works  i know it sounds crazy but  this will give us a chance to get away from both of our families and see if this works  might be fun  yes  really  yes  yes  yes yes  but lets go right now  before my uncle gets out of the shower for some more cigarettes  you take that i got to leave a note  but there was one piece of intelligence that michael didnt have  interesting  dont even think about it jay  shes an mrf  mrf whats that  mentally retarded female  that explains what shes doing with him  and the hats  oh my god  shes gonna marry him  on the next arrested development  george sr disoriented in the walls almost makes contact with a new mole  not that one  wait for it  annyong  hello  and michael and rita start a new life together  whats that  a prize  a lovely lovely prize
