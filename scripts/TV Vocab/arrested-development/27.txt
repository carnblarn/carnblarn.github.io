                now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything  and the one son who had no choice  but to keep them all together  its arrested development   it was monday morning  and michael bluth was nervous about meeting  with the new prosecutor ofhis fathers criminal case  i dont know what youre so nervous about michael  its a new prosecutor its a whole new beginning  a new day a new case a whole new set of lies   im not lying anymore mom   michael was lying  he found his fugitive father earlier in the week  and he was hiding him in the attic  where george sr was currently waiting for his breakfast  about the business just for the record  i was not involved with dad building houses in iraq   thats exactly what im gonna tell them  is that for lindsay  because shes not scared to eat in front of me anymore  those are the whites only yes  these arent for lindsay these are mine  anyway im not lying anymore either michael  im being lied   on    wow now mores gonna come up than go down  i gotta get outta here   hmm  i cant take this anymore  i mean shes just so loving and affectionate  l lthis is not the woman i fell in love with  oscar please you cant go you gotta stay okay  this is the nicest shes been since she found out rosa could breastfeed buster  oh buster dont even bring that up hes well into his army training   actually buster had hit a wall in his army training  i cant do it i cant make my bed and i cant do this either  arent you supposed to yell at me and call me homo and motivate me over this wall  we cant do that anymore lawsuit   in fact it was a recent ruling  prosecuted by the same man who michael was soon to meet with  its going to be a long time before sergeant wendell baker  calls someone private homo again  god willing hell fail boot camp  well why wouldnt he he already failed day camp   hey  hi hey dad   you ready for the prosecutor  hi i hope so   howd that math test work out  oh it was okay i guess  but i dont know it was weird i studied with ann  but i still got a bminus   ann got you a bminus  well it wasnt ann shes an expert in math   isnt that cute  is it   michael felt his son was setting the bar too low  with his dating standards  no it wasnt anns fault i think i just ended up thinkin about the questions too long  and so by the time i put an answer down i went with like  my fifth choice or somethin like that  george michael never settle for fifth choice  something better is gonna come along she just has to  i think maybe sitting in the back of the class with ann is a bad idea  you know shes just so pretty   i get distracted i guess  do you   i wish i could draw her nose  maybe its your eyes  maybe you need glasses for your grades  didnt you say you had a hard time readin the board   sittin in the back row  no i said i was in the back of the classroom   thats what i mean yeah  its different no no  well i dont know maybe   no definitely ill call the eye doctor  i guess  im gonna set you up an appointment okay   hey gang  tobias  oh ooh im afraid ill have to take them to go im late for the gym  oh and also heres a number  in case the blue man group calls and needs an understudy  i just found out that my cellular telephone was a lemon   it didnt work   neither do you     pretty brave card for you to play   i just cant stand it tobias getting in shape    for a bunch of slutty gym rats   whats wrong with your voice  nothing ive been going out   lindsay had been frequenting singles clubs  also still hoping to make her open marriage work    whoo  which it wont   i didnt catch that  whoo  i wonder how many women hes slept with if any  lindsay its not a competition  of course it is michael thats why they call it scoring   maybe in the 70s  that many weve only been doing this for a month  instead of competing with tobias why dont you try spending   a little more time with your daughter  why tobias doing that    at that moment lindsays daughter     was in the process of wooing her own man  who is it   steve holt  maeby had even started ordering unnecessary items  just to have more occasions to see him  uh you ordered a memories ofthanksgiving basket   wow that looks great   maeby whos your friend   is this your sister  no  but you just made my day  thank you for the basket see ya   he thinks im cute  hes 19 hes a senior at my high school   and had been for several years   you know what  i think i am gonna spend more time with my daughter  i cant promise you i wont tell the prosecutor about that   where you been  are you wearing my dead wifes maternity clothes  yeah its the only thing i could find   where are the eggs  doctor says theyre bad for the baby   so you ready for this new prosecutor  i was until you came back  youre not gonna turn me in are you  because i had no idea there were sanctions against uh iraq  you know ththey sent me over there they said go build  uh uh do i look like a criminal mastermind to you  how do you get this ham open i cant i cant get this ham open  im not gonna turn you in but you have put me in a position where im gonna have to lie  why did you come back here in the first place  oh no reason your mother happens to be shtupping my brother thats all  im only here to find out if i have a shot with her  if shes really in love with oscar i dont know to hell with her  ill just ill just leave   ill never come back  great shes really in love with him  thats very funny i need you to find out okay  cause ever since l i heard about this    i cant sleep  i cant i cant eat  oh look it just peels off isnt that clever   later that day george michael was having his eye exam  and finding it to be just as difficult as his math exam   one or two  two no no one   okay two or three  three  uh unless three is too much of an improvement  im sorry is one is one in the mix still   and michael met with the new prosecutor waynejarvis  im sorry i dont understand how this is not a conflict of interest  you almost represented us and now youre the prosecutor  the patriot act read it  lim not even the president anymore my brother gob is  i spoke with gob he appears to know nothing  yeah thats not an act he twice tried to microwave  a ding dong while it was still in its foil   twice  twice   two times   in fact gob had been grilled earlier   i dont know anything about the business  were gonna get you bluth  well give you a few minutes to think about what you want to do  he knows less than anyone we have ever questioned   gob knew too little to know that however  and his confidence had never been more shaken  andjust when he thought he couldnt handle another embarrassment   youre free to go  things could get very messy for you michael unless you have something to bargain with  like say a fugitive   i dont know where to find such a thing  look harder   there might be something in it for you  something to get me off  if you could find a certain someone  can i have a moment alone with my client please  did you follow any of that  yeah hes hinting that hes gonna grant me immunity  but only on the condition that i turn in my father  you know where your father is no wait dont tell me now  okay if you know give me a high five  mmmmm   michael hadjust found out   that his legal problems might go away ifhe turned in his father    its just you and me now huh  no barry l i know where my father is okay  he came back to make sure that my mother wasnt really in love with my uncle  he wants to know if hes still got a shot with her if he doesnt hes leaving  if hes got a shot with her just give me a little tap on the fanny   thats not gonna happen  okay  then look just tell him anything he wants to hear to keep him from running  we just have to keep him here until we can hear  what kind of deal theyre offering you  you just trust me im a lot more competent than you can imagine  oh i forgot to take the tinfoil off too  i really wanted that   buster meanwhile was sharing his failure  with someone who was wellversed on the subject  i mean i couldnt get over the wall they put me on suspension until i can  perhaps you need to find somebody who can motivate you   yeah but who   and then it hit him   gob had always proven a good motivator for buster   do it      when you do this without getting punched in the chest youll have more fun    thanks brother  hey brother  how would you like to go to the old playground with me  im sure as hell not gonna go back to work im never going back there  oh well then perchance i might be able to borrow your cellular telephone  im not fit to run a company  and i dont deserve a fancy phone  well the blue man group might need me and i do deserve a fancy phone   they didnt and he doesnt  michael knew he couldnt let his father get away  so he decided to see ifhis mother and oscar really were in love  so come on arent you really just dating oscar to get back at dad  oh it may have started as that  but i have fallen in love with oscar  and its so nice not to have to worry about getting pregnant  the doctor said i couldnt be a mother now if i tried  and that was without even interviewing me  here you go hot tea  because thats what you are a hottie  stop me from pouring this on myself i cant take this anymore  all right now listen oscar  maybe you should think about moving on you know  this really isnt your scene with the sweaters and the furniture  maybe you should take a leap at freedom like my father  just run     is that her rape horn  its more like a starters pistol   run   meanwhile tobias set about learning how to operate his new cell phone     oh   and lindsay tried to spend more time getting to know her daughter   hi baby oh steve hi   hi  what are you doing here  i thought id spend a little time with my daughter  after all it hasnt been that long since ive been in high school     is that a fire   we have to go to class  okay well this was fun  maybe later we can all spend a little more time together go shopping get a drink  im in school and im 15  oh well im much much much  older than 15   you dont look it  oh steve  he thinks im young you made my day again     your moms pretty uh out there  shes not my mom  but she said you were her daughter  his daughter thats my dad   thats a dude  and the worst part is  he thinks hes passing   right outside the school buster tried to put his own plan  into action by stirring up old memories  what do you say i need your help to get over the wall push me  im the pathetic one buster not you  i totally freaked out in front of that prosecutor today  like a little girl in a little dress  little saddle shoes little pigtails  wow that does sound like a little girl  come on get my ire up  push me   oh  oh this is turning out to be much more fun than id hoped   it was fun but it wasnt making him a better soldier  push me higher   ooh ill do it  whoo   and michael reported to his father about his meeting with the prosecutor   prosecutor offer you a deal  that was not said  but uh more importantly you should know that it seems like oscars on his way out   really  yeah so just sit tight and everything should be fine  wow hey by the way i broke this thing l    what the hell is it anyway  thats a breast pump dad  oh well i did not use it for that   and so michael went to meet the prosecutor  i felt obligated to share some photographs with you  i obtained these from the bluth company email server  you tapped into our email thats legal  im going for a hot ding dong  hot ding dong yeah  michael this is a closeup satellite photograph of the iraqi countryside  see this little series of hills around that stream  those are bunkers we believe that those bunkers  contain weapons of mass destruction  we also think that your father was building on that land to hide them  which is why that photograph was on his email   are you serious  almost always  i was once called the worst audience participant cirque du soleil ever had   this is a big accusation  i did not find their buffoonery amusing   about my father  hes guilty michael of medium to heavy treason  that proves it you cant protect him  turn him in and immunity is yours    michael returned home to confront his father  michael  mom was just here looking for you  shes claiming oscars disappeared because of something you said   cant talk right now  really  whats wrong with your voice  i can talk sure i didnt say anything to oscar   anything else  no  oh hey did i tell you i accidentally ran into steve holt  wow everything about you is so womanly  youre everything a woman should be   thank you steve  we ended up making a lunch date  i thought you were spending time with maeby  yeah ill have to reschedule her  but mom isnt the only one finding love where she least expects it her words  whwhoa finding love she said that where here  yeah she wont shut up about him  she said tingling like 75 times   gets me tingling and you know with oscar theres tingling   she said those words in this house  yeah  dad  hello   michael hadjust discovered that his father had escaped from the attic  hello  this is gonna sound like a strange question but have you seen dad  of course not and im not talking to you  you tried to scare away oscar which didnt work   hes back  i just uh  i just wanted to have sex with you thatsthats all im good for  did you hear that he said he just wants to   goodbye mom  have sex with me   you smell like a pinecone  yeah thats the weed  i went to my uh my  hole trailer  and l i smoked some like a cigarette  should we take it into the bedroom   only if you really love me  of course i do   ohh    whats wrong with you where are you going  im on mushrooms  im on bad mushrooms   and soon the prosecutors evidence became public  weve obtained photographs that officials call definite proof of wmds in iraq  what that means for your weekend at 1000   it seems that due to the new informationsharing provisions  in the patriot act the photos had made the rounds  through several branches of government  and ultimately to the us army itself  i just came back to tell you i cant do that wall  theres no time for that were shipping out without you   what  didnt you see    pick it up pick it up  weapons of mass destruction    those bastards  i did not say that  are you gonna let that slide are you gonna allow your children  and your childrens children  and any children that i might have out there  to live in fear for the rest of their lives  climb that wall homo  climb it   andjust as the men thought the day could get no more surprising     it did   ohh ooh       when you do this without getting punched youll have more fun   oh hey george michael  oh hi  they found wmds in iraq so we got a halfday  cool so i got a c on my math test  not anticipating a good reaction on that  well the b got you glasses maybe this time youll get a neck brace  anyways have you seen my mom  seems possible   shes on her way to meet steve holt  i thought you liked him  i do im crazy about him but hes obsessed with her  thats all he wants to talk about   lindsay felt bad perhaps she had hurt her daughter  by putting herself first  but she would have felt worse if shed remained even a moment longer  but its only because he thinks shes got a penis  oh i told him she was a tranny   meanwhile michael was still up in the attic  dad whats goin on somebody could see you  whats the difference mike youre turning me in arent you  they say youre involved in something real big dad theyve got photos  not true but go knock yourself out turn me in  i went and i saw for myself  shes in love with him  then why did you come back why didnt you just leave forever like you said  and go where   make a deal for yourself mike  i got no love in my life anymore   and michael realized for the first time  that his father was capable ofhaving his heart broken  later that day michael had his meeting with the prosecutor  so where the hell is he come on bluth whats it gonna be  your father or your freedom   and michael had to do the right thing  i dont know what happened to him  michael when we started talking to you we didnt have anything  but now we got something   and youre gonna do time for it  those are the pictures  theyre all over the news   those are balls  what   barry was right tobias had inadvertently photographed himself  while learning to use his camera phone  see uh this close they always look like landscape  nope youre lookin at balls   soon forensic scientists confirmed this  and for the second time in two days  the informationsharing network put into place by the patriot act  was put to use  theyre balls   were looking at balls lets turn it around   copy on balls were turning  and eventually the news traveled back to the source  we got one wrong and we do apologize  im on tv   and michael returned home a free man  you got the glasses now youll do better on those math exams  i think i blew the eye exam too every time i take these off i feel better  let me see em   ive seen this before   for a while george michael  had shared a room with his uncle tobias   oh ththeres a ladder   i dont need it  yeah i dont think you need glasses son  well if the cops are waiting im ready to go  i got nothin since your mother deserted me  you know youyou deserted her dad  you know you escaped and then you faked your death  im not so sure she sees you as that reliable  but listen for what its worth  i did not turn you in   you didnt  no  and i dont know whether its just tracys maternity clothes  but its very nice to see a softer side of you  although im sorry that you feel you have no love in your life  well i dont i dont feel that way anymore  thanks  been a long time since someone stood up for me   found her perfume huh  just a little left in the bottle   well that was the end of it  yeah   its nice on you  thank you   on the next arrested development  oscar returns to find a nowdistant lucille  im back but just for now  cause you get on
