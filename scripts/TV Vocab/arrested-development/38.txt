family of course knew it was tobias  but the house had never been cleaner  hello young lady i havent seen you in a week  oh right that means mrs featherbottom isnt here  which means she didnt iron my blouse  which means i dont have anything to wear for my premiere  the premier of canada  hes going out with my gym teacher   maeby was actually referring to the premiere of a film  from the studio where she had conned her way into a job  hey jeff did you get a chance to do coverage on  voices in america history in prespective  yeah i looked that up its a ninth grade history textbook  yeah and if i dont get your report on it i wont be able to pass  on it because i have a feeling its a piece of    unfortunately thejob was wreaking havoc with her language  maybe we just need a new  housekeeper  okay im sure she would have ironed it for you  had you told her about it before she changed out of her bloody work clothes  but i am off then     i gotta keep him trying that is the job  michael what are you doing tomorrow  having my day ruined with whatever youre about to ask me to do  its my wedding anniversary and oscar wants to throw me a party  he is aware that hes not married to you right   in fact oscar had started to perceive that lucille was pulling away from him  not now its my time of the month  not now i dont want to risk having a baby it could kill me    so he went to buster for advice  i think she misses my brother   my father  yes i mean yes   maybe i should throw her an anniversary party   oh  so when he doesnt show shell realize that you were the one who was always there for us  well i was thinking one more party and then id move out  but no i like your plan better  the only problem is we know hes hes around somewhere  well he didnt return when i lost my hand  but you you not only embrace it  but i saw you kissing it while you thought i was sleeping         who knows what goes on in that potaddled mind ofhis  anyway its a party and i want the whole

as it turned out he got too serious with the teddy bear  ill see you at the anniversary party   gangys having an anniversary party  seems that way   is franklin gonna be there  see that mike kids love franklin  i just dont want him to point out my cracker ass in front of ann  imagine what hed say about her  so you were listening in on george michael  can you believe what he asked me this morning  do you think my moms engagement ring is still around  of course it is your father would never part with something so precious   in fact lindsay was currently wearing it on her middle toe roast beef  im thinking of asking ann to get preengaged   you are  yeah i feel like god moved her here from ohio to be with me    her  well thats the first ive heard of this   well then who said her  me that wasthat was me  but um her  look its just a preengagement its exciting  you know its young love  i had it once a man i loved   heres young maebys blouse  and then things took a turn somehow  master

i thought dad  this is where youve been hi michael  i just came back because of your mother  shes with my brother on my anniversary  but i got an idea from george michael  i need to recommit myself to your mother   her  but you gotta get me into that party  then you gotta take me to this church  i found this brochure that ann left behind  thats gonna be tough im not really all that invited  i got it all worked out but i need a limousine  l i can do this dad im gonna make you proud  never too late to start   and michael drove to anns house where he finally got to meet anns parents  this is my father pastor terry veal   hello  oh pastor i didnt know you didnt tell me   i told you  no you didnt  people treat you so differently when they find out youre a man of god   oh believe me i know  oh are you a churchgoing man  i am  sometimes yes i dont go religiously  i mean im not a nut about it  because there is no such thing as a nut when it comes to religion pastor  ive met a few  im sure if you look a bit closer youll find some very earnest people  that are just doing their best   what are you doin dad  im not sure  why dont you kids run along and let us get to know each other a bit better thank you   maybe i should get my wife honey  okay   this is george michaels father  this is your wife didnt didnt realize you could remarry   what  is this anns mother   im mrs veal  im sorry i just  i did not expect somebody so young  next youre gonna say how ann and i can be sisters  no id never say that  listen im here because  i think my son might be planning on asking your daughter to get preengaged   oh my gosh  oh my gosh  well that is something to celebrate  can we open up some sparkling apple cider   no  oh did you want us to go down to the liquor store  and get you some liquor  no dont you think theyre a bit too young  oh we got serious around his age  who can blame you you gotta lock that down  but im not quite sure that theyre ready  michael in my experience there is no recipe for a perfect match  it takes the love of two families  well you havent met my family   and thats when michael devised a new plan to win the vealsdisapproval  you havent met my family  you should meet my family  were gonna be having an anniversary party   what a wonderful surprise  we would love to witness a celebration of their love  that would be a wonderful surprise   but he did want a little bit of insurance  hey gob mom wants franklin at the party  yeah what  no no no i dont want to talk hey franklin   lucille was setting up for the anniversary party  that she didnt expect her husband to attend    wheres the food  sorry just stuffing the mushroom  you realize thats tobias dont you  if hes gonna raid my closet hes gonna work for it   what happened to his ankle   tobias had attempted an entrance  that he hoped would enchant his daughter    ohhhh  we shant be telling your mother this shant we  maybe you can point out to your mother that your father hasnt arrived yet  hmm so my fathers not here  maybe he is  ann just called they had a predawn mass and then theyre gonna go to mass so  well anns got a great deal of mass  anyway i hope that the veals like us  why dont you go top off your gangy thanks  wait a minute you invited the veals  only so that theyll disapprove of us  i gotta kill this preengagement somehow  and after moms second vodka and after busters second juice box  theyre gonna forbid ann from even seeing my son  much less taking his ring and im still the good guy  so the devout religious family theyre the bad guys  youll understand when maeby starts getting proposals   actually maeby had given two that day  im sorry i cant read what you wrote on this buck slip  youve got the handwriting of a 15yearold  fifteenyearold marry me  hey im almost done with that coverage i can bring it to you tonight  are you still at the balboa towers   maeby had used her grandmothers address  so as not to arouse suspicion at home  this required convincing the guard she was several years younger than her age  boy you get a lot of mail from that movie studio  i write a lot of letters to movie stars   you seem a little old for that  babysit me  that place seems so old for you  ill send dr epstein your compliments   and may i add marry me  okay   and maeby realized she might be in need of a new deflection   hi mrs veal welcome  mom this is anns mother

yeah  you know it did kind of feel right to me   but yeah ive gotta trust you right  thank you thank you  damn maybe i should  maybe i should ask if she wants to get prepreengaged add another  the mere fact that youre laughing about marriage   means that youre not ready okay  wha   and lucille was asked to the kitchen  whats so important that youre dragging me away from this miserable party  well i just had an old friend who wanted to tell you  how much i miss you  oh who let this little black   hey brother   who you callin brother you hookass  mother       what the hell kind of puppet
