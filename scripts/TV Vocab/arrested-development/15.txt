solution for his space problem     and then he decided that perhaps he  too should try a little relaxation  back at the construction site gob was  also ready to take the afternoon off  screw this i have my pride  i dont care how much theyre paying me  you got paid i thought we  were all making sacrifices  yeah well maybe its time for some of  those big shots at the bluth company  to start making
