                now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything  and the one son who had no choice  but to keep them all together  its arrested development   michael bluth had gotten up early  in the hopes of avoiding his family  his mother however was already dressed made up and waiting for him    good morning  ooh   which put her wakeup time in the 300 330 area  i couldnt sleep i always get this way before motherboy  oh god its motherboy already   motherboy was a dinner dance aimed at promoting motherson bonding  lucille had gone over 25 times with buster  and on a few occasions had won cutest couple  as one entered sexual maturity and the other one left it  it became harder to win   im so hot  if you were hot mother we would win  its not just motherboy its motherboy xxx   and i think with you ive got a shot  oh no   buster for the first time ever doesnt want to do this  no he does  its just hes been so mopey  that could have something to do with the fact that a seal ate his hand   i dont know what it is  i think thats what it is   who knows   it was that  it had happened weeks earlier when buster went swimming in the ocean   against his mothers wishes     he had become haunted by the loss     seeing reminders of the accident everywhere      mother i cant sleep i may not be able to go to dance practice today  im going out zip me up  i mean look how he zips now  i know what this is youre embarrassed by him arent you  you spent your whole life overmothering the guy  and when he finally needs you youre not there  well i dont see you spending time with him   the bluth children had been uneasy about missing limbs  since their father used a onearmed man to teach them lessons  thats why you dont yell     as a matter of fact im going to see buster today  so youre gonna have to find a different dance partner for motherboy     god not that im in love with my mother dance thing  im so glad there wasnt one of those for daddies and daughters   of course they have fatherdaughter dances  they do he never took me  it was before we did your nose toodleoo   youre up awful early  well my marriage is falling apart   tobias is back with carl   tobias had gotten a call  from his onetime acting teacher carl weathers  hes directing something for tv but he thinks he might have a part for me  if this takes off i might be able to buy you the happiness that you deserve  he said the same thing when he got cast as frightened inmate number two  in that film he got fired from   he had even gotten a vanity plate made up announcing the achievement  and this wasnt the first time  hes so clueless hes not your real take charge husband  lindsay youre still looking for somebody like daddy okay  lets not forget that he was also dismissive and disinterested  no no he had good qualities   actually george sr was secretly living   in the attic above them and was starved for company   nellie  now  who wants to take their top off     when george michael and maeby came in  so you and ann are actually going on a christian camping trip  its called the promise land youre supposed to make promises  about your relationship as a tribute to the generations that preceded you  hey theres booze in this  thats the promise land that anns taking you to  youre gonna need this more than polly here   that ones polly  hey what are you kids doin up here  were lookin for the camping stuff do you know where the pump is for the air mattress  i had to take all pumps out of here a long time ago  take this down to the kitchen will you  i think its getting too risky keeping you up here  you know whats risky lettin your son go on that church thing  her names ann dad and hes not going on her okay   theyre just friends  not for long  theyre making promises to each other  its all that fidelity and pledging yourself to a woman garbage  i wine em and dine em but i dont let em tell me what to do  i dont let em tell me what to do  okay i shouldve never taken the pumps out ofhere  listen unlike you i respect my sons choices  george michael i dont think you should be going on this promise land thing  what why because id miss school   no  you get to miss school for that   and thats when maeby decided to become a devout christian  do you guys know where i could get one of those gold necklaces with the t on it   thats a cross  across from where  um its not about school pal its more about family  your uncle busters been very depressed lately and you havent visited him  family first or did they not teach you that at the promise land   i dont know you wont let me go   attaboy   michael then went to the office where he ran into gob  barry come by yet i need to talk to him about my divorce  gob had once gotten married on a dare  a fact hed only remembered when he was served with divorce papers   that cow is going after me  your wife she was superthin   she was  yeah  what about her cans she have big cans   you dont remember her at all  it was one night of wild passion   and yet you didnt notice her body  i like to look in the mirror  that would be disgusting if youd actually slept with her but i dont think you did   i did and it was disgusting   they didnt but it would have been  anyway remember that seal of hers that i released into the ocean   bit off busters hand  vaguely  her lawyers are claiming that the seals worth 250 grand  and thats not even including busters swatch  listen gob if you admit in court that you never consummated the marriage  you can get it annulled and walk away free and clear  you just cant deal with the fact that ive got a superthin wife with huge cans     all right whos ready to show their lawyer some love  the seal  mustve had a tracking device on it  someone tracked it all the way to a dock in dana point  you know if that hand is still intact inside the seal busters got a shot at a transplant  at the very least we can get busters swatch back right  up top no   and tobias met with carl weathers at burger king   and tobias met with carl weathers at burger king  thanks for meeting me down here at burger king  im tryin to get them to underwrite a new tv project im workin on  get some money in exchange for

spending some time with whats left of your uncle  i was supposed to go away to the promise land this weekend but my dad didnt want me to   family first  well youve done your duty this week  youre a very sympathetic young man  very sympathetic you know what  you deserve to go out of town this weekend and im taking you   really   george michael should have realized  by the sailor suit lucille dressed him in  that he wasnt going north to the promise land  i cant believe you dont know this song george michael    no he was going south   south to motherboy   and michael and gob headed out to find the seal with the tracking device  i guess we should call buster and have him meet us at the dock right  i guess so    or we could make sure its the right seal first   i mean why get his hopes up  yeah thats better   knock knock  oh god   monster  hey brothers   buster  bonster   sorry about the window  not a problem  i really hate this stupid hook but i certainly cant walk around like this   why not  very handsome  we were just gonna call you we think we know where the seal is   the seal that did this to me  yeah   take me  yes thats a good idea  im gonna go with barry you should get in here ill just go with barry  theres not enough room for you and me and the stump and the thing stuff barry   tobias had gotten his first speaking role  simply by signing away the life rights of everyone he loved   and now he needed some research   im george sr  ooh thats good thats the voice ive got the voice   thats not my voice  oh my god   what are you doing here  im havin a  tea party  what does it look like i live here you tell anybody you are dead   tobias saw the raw power of george sr  stop licking my hand you horses ass    apower he needed the man to teach him  thats it   so he explained the project and george sr agreed on one condition  if you play me you gotta play me like a man  and not some mincing little polly or nellie  i get those names confused apologies apologies all around   and the search for busters hand continued  i would love to be able to say look what ive had reattached  while you and george michael were off to motherboy  motherboy wait a minute   mom took him to motherboy    he couldnt wait to swoop in and throw on that sailor suit because hes not damaged goods  wait a minute i dont want him doing that  you gotta go with me down there and help me get him all right   that place is your scene  face it michael theyve won  hes the new buster   this was the worst thing michael could possibly hear  oh im so sorry false alarm what they tracked down was a shark  and he mustve bitten off the part of the seal with the tracking device on it   left flipper  so the seal lost his hand too  yeah poor guys probably out there without a flipper  swimming around in a circle freaking out his whole family  that tracking device tells me he was raised in captivity   theres no way he stood a chance out in the real world  see that he was a victim too  you both were too sheltered to learn how to protect yourselves  and we cant let that happen to george michael  i will help you michael weve got to rescue your son  and ive got to staple this to a seal  and ive skipped breakfast so im off to burger king   and lucille arrived at the hotel where motherboy was taking place  this is nice spending some time just the two of us  oh  me the exact same color  what are the odds  not to worry gangy brought some backups  well get a room so we can change  you think enough time has passed to do sonny and cher    who  were here for motherboy  and you do realize this is not the band    motherboy was also a heavy metal band    that used to rock pretty hard in the 70s  we are legally obligated to make the distinction  maybe i should let my dad know that were here  oh hell know when we bring home the trophy  yeah but maybe ill just give him a call   and what name shall we put the room under   karmopolis   and lindsay was about to see  a tobias with the raw power of george sr  i sort of want to talk to you about some things  its a little late for talk lindsay im a man of action now     you dont need the calories   this isnt working  is it my imagination or is he more commanding and mannish  its like i dont know maybe i do want to be with him  then you should go to him for as it is written  you shall be with whom you have formed a more perfect union with under god   shes right  this isnt working  im sorry youve got the wrong motherboy   this looks like the place   and michael and buster arrived at motherboy  excuse me has a lucille bluth checked in   i have no one by that name  god   she knows youre after her  she does  wait a minute i recognize those outfits   were getting you out of here  thank you thank you   oh god its red  take me with you no please please   its the wrong child  where do we go next  i will tell you this michael if mother saw those two she is going to change clothes  and that means hell be on the balcony  whenever she changed clothes she made me wait on the balcony until zipup  and yet anything goes at bath time   lets check the balconies   and barry prepared gob to meet with his wife  if you really want to settle this your job  is to convince that wife of yours  that you are willing to go in front of thejudge and admit that you never had sex  she has a name barry you dont happen to know what it is by the way do you  thats why i want to settle im not super prepared  well we did have sex and im not a great liar   both things hejust said were lies   but if you think itll scare her off  i do and it will  and you dont want to go in front of that judge i caught him in a drag club   what were you doin there  wow you should be the lawyer   and soon michael and buster surveyed the hotel  iooking for george michael  theres a very boredlooking little sonny bono on that balcony   oh god that means shell be dressed like cher  i have an idea  it is time i used something i trained for in army but i never got a chance to do   you cannot zipline over there  either i zip down or he zips up  and that is a mighty long zipper on mothers cher jumpsuit  you have to get on your knees to start it  this is much less scary godspeed buster     one two three     you came for me        zip me up  were switching rooms again and costumes   tobias had begun work on the set of scandal makers  whats so great about tobias is hes got this obligation to his wife and daughter   whoa this guys straight  yeah  then what the hell am i wearin these for look at that  hey gang im sorry i dont want to note you to death  but you should be wearing those under your pants   why  its a thing theres dozens of us  this whole thing is startin to feel like a real career killer   yeah i know man  also l  tobias why dont you go learn your lines man work on them  did i get lines god  they told me i was just jumping onto a moving stair car  if that mans straight then i am sober  hi um im waiting for gawb bluth  im gob bluth my wife send you   im your wife  i knew that  nice to see you again usarmy  you lost a lot of weight in iraq especially up in the northern region   so wheres the seal  hey thats not my problem  as far as im concerned we were never even married  maybe ill just say that we never sealed the deal   youre willing to admit that  lie about it yes  wow i misunderestimated you  youve got some courage makes me wonder what im missing  you mean other than your cans  no theyre still here   and so gob set about consummating  the marriage hed finally agreed to claim he hadnt    and back at motherboy xxx lucille was finding her new partner an asset   is this your son  no im his grandmother   hes an orphan  oh im so sorry   well you guys should win  im not an orphan i have a dad  well good luck to you  well that little bit of honesty helped nothing  youd better bring it to the waltz young man   meanwhile michael and buster had retrieved busters hook  and were staking out the situation  gypsies  hey   theyve changed into gypsies my army training  tells me that this is going to be a hot mission   one hot mission  yes  i create a diversion and you grab george michael and go  we need a name  maybe operation hot mother   no lets try to top that   they never did   and later operation hot mother was underway    buster was waiting for michaels cue to unplug the lights  but thats when buster caught his hook on a sandbag   hey      and now from the land of gypsies lucille bluth and her orphaned grandson  what the hells goin on buster cut the lights        buster  grab him take the gypsy boy   im

supposed to do it  you didnt want to  no buster l i didnt know how to uh treat you all right  i thought that you would be a little different but youre not  i was wrong okay im sorry  you know youre as good a brother as you ever were    thank you  all right  yes i am no different i am the same old motherboy  george michael still has a chance take him  thanks lets go  boys choice  that is if youre

land  all right  i appreciate you taking me up here to see ann   a promise is a promise and im glad the three of us  yeah   were able to spend some time together  oh yeah   and i finally feel good about myself saddest  and i saw some of those people   that was a very competitive category  oh dont i know it   here we go  i cant get out actually   on the next arrested development  lindsay finds herself strangely compelled to be with tobias  i have never been more attracted to you  wow the service sent you over fast  oh god im so sorry im in the wrong trailer   but not the one shes married to  so you dont cry when you take those off   having finally had sex gob can admit  he never consummated their marriage  judge maybe you should take a look at this it was taken in your office just moments ago   but gob catches a lucky break  theres no way to tell who this man is   but it doesnt last long  thats me your honor l  my wife   we really lost this case   and maeby impresses the kids at the promise land  with her one scary campfire story  knock scrape the only thing more terrifying  than the escaped lunatics hook was his twisted call   hey campers      im a monster  this may have been a step backwards    upon her knee  so fine to be  mother and boy  mother    boy
