                now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything  and the one son who had no choice  but to keep them all together  its arrested development   michael bluth hadjust been stunned to discover  that a contract his company was counting on was being cut back  you initially told us to design and build 22 homes now youre saying 18  that doesnt give us enough capital to complete the job  and weve already got the blueprints drawn up and everything   well that part wasnt true but they wouldve     that was a very important phone call  i dont have much time michael tobias is about to walk in here any minute asking for a job   i need you to hire him     hi im sor  look it isnt my idea its his  but i need a break from mrs featherbottom   since moving out tobias had been pretending to be a british housekeeper   as a way to be close to his family    however his desire to now be discovered as himself was becoming bothersome  cant you just tell him you know that hes mrs featherbottom  no shes the only one who can hand wash my delicates  yeah the real tobias wouldnt do that   wouldnt do what  be michaels assistant  well thats what i came down here to ask about  i think youll find me more than qualified  its really not that simple uh youd have to submit a rsum  booyah   wow gobias industries   gobias   right i remember yeah  as in go buy us a cup of  it looks like you might be a little too qualified  hang on why dont you let your new assistant take all this down   wow you are gung ho  youre getting a new assistant is this because the order was cut back  no but if you are concerned about keeping your job  focus on keeping unwanted visitors out of my office  i have rabies michael you know that today was day four of my shots   starla had been bitten by  a wellknown music producers guard dog  michael starla told us about the cutback  you know a lot of our overhead is tied up in the fact  we are on the top floor of a very expensive building   if we move just one floor lower  ted everythings fine  i got it all under control and nobody needs to move   im sorry ted is it  yes  ted did ted make an appointment   no i just work down the hall and   no  well then ted can get the hell out of this office   im talking  you get the hell out   and thats how you keep out unwanted visitors   thank you  although if i may let me take off my assistant skirt  and put on my barbra streisand in the prince of tides assmasking therapist pantsuit   what  the reason that you cant accept my help  is the same reason you cant hear that gentlemans idea  because you have to be in total control of everything  and its going to make you sick if you cant let go   hey im fine  oh   oh ooh   see hes right youve got a control problem  but i know this eastern medicine store ancient chinese secret   ancient chinese secret huh   i sent gob there for his migraines  its just a cramp im fine   in fact gob was at ancient chinese secret at that moment   but not for a migraine  yeah i need a tea to give my dingle less tingle  me quick want slow wait thats indian   tea for dong     sweet blade  its the sword of destiny its full of ancient magic  oh yeah you into magic  still whered the lighter fluid come from   so is it for sale i could use it in my act  maybe  sword of destiny hundreds of years old  come with ancient story of warning and  yeah i make up my own patter just ring it up with the dong tea   and gob caught up with michael   michael been lookin for you  looks like youre looking for dragons in the future  i wouldnt mock the sword of destiny michael  careful with that gob   bleeding  nope  yeah thats blood itll get better before the show  thats what i need you for michael  i cant perform my illusion at the gothic castle  because ive been banned from the magicians alliance  i need you to register as the magician and im the lowly assistant  then we get on the stage and you ram the sword of destiny into my belly   what do you think  really picked up steam there at the end but i cant  ive gotta teach george michael how to drive and then i gotta get right back here because  michael if i make this comeback  ill buy you 100 george michaels you can teach to drive   youre losing blood arent you  probably my socks are wet  sorry  youll be sorry wait that doesnt work after his line   and michael rushed home to teach his son to drive  knock knock hey maeby george michael ready to drive   i dont have much time  get me behind that wheel  oh no you will not be behind the wheel  youll observe me while i demonstrate some things okay  ill be quizzing you too hotshot im gonna go grab the video camera   and then schools in  id skip  well no i need to learn  you cant get around anywhere without a drivers license   actually maeby had received a company car from the movie studio  where she was secretly posing as an executive  but currently george sr was in the attic making a videotape    this is my demand  when michael found him  whats the deal with the turban  huh  pretty smart huh   andand its warm too  guess that makes sense  oh hey i heard about that reduced order those bastards  this videotape is for our employees  you take this and play it this will reassure them that someone is in charge  well someone is in charge dad im in charge ive never even taken a sick day  no a real authority  my presence needs to be uh reinstated   his first effort at doing so had already failed  when do you start being my mole at my company  actually michael turned me down for the job   what  something to do with their housing order being cut back  oh my god thats a horrible sign ow damn it  im the authority so i will save the company  and i say no videotape ooh   you oughta take a sick day get out of that office  dont count on it dad   and michael was finally ready to make his son watch him drive  all right stair car basics in order to get this thing up to a minimum speed  you gotta jam on the gas pedal for about a minute okay  but in order to slow this thing down  you gotta get immediately back on the brake pedal  cause you got about two tons of stairs behind you  were gonna cover the hydraulic flaps and the riser system  after i tell you the basics about how to avoid a hopon  but the first thing were gonna go over ow   and thats when michael decided that perhaps it was time for a sick day  lets go over the route to the hospital ow  my baby is sick but mother is here to nurse you   well now im a little sicker  well dont you worry about work today  i am ready and willing to step up and take over  yeah and ill get george michael ready for his driving test  im gonna teach him when i get out and no ones taking over for me at the bluth company  michael this is what we talked about im sure theyll do just fine without you  well youre wrong because were in crisis there  they need to know that im in charge and im in con  im peeing am i peeing  im sorry we gave you a little something to relax you  it may have taken the tingle out of your genitals  oh no youre not taking care of my son  im sorry to say this but its too late for me to do anything for your son  let him keep talking  because dr stein here has already been assigned to his case   youre lucky hes the best  well only in the county  but im certainly good enough to take out that appendix of yours   appendix  i dont buy it could be a hernia   or it could be your colon  id want to get in there and find some answers  well i am the best doctor in the state  but if you dont trust my decisions  no no no no youre the doctor you see hes the authority here  we need to respect him just like the employees at the bluth company need to respect me  okay im going to put you on this machine to slow down your heart rate  hopefully not too slow because its already dangerously slow as it is     whatever you think doctor   meanwhile gob was still trying to arrange his comeback in magic  so id be a magician and youd be my assistant  well on paper yes  but once the show starts and you ram that sword through my belly  people will know that im the one who belongs back in the alliance  the kind of trick that i can put on a dvd like tony wonder does   tony wonder had startled the world by baking himself into a loaf ofbread  he sold the dvds of it on his web site   which many claimed suffered due to its popup ads   thanks  im finally being treated like a real person not some deformed   hook forgot about that thing elephant man  gonna have to figure out something to do so that people can look at you  without wanting to kill themselves   that night george sr heard about michaels illness  the employees are gonna panic they need to know that someones in control   and how do we do that  booyah   and at the gothic castle   buster had been outfitted with a mechanical halloween hand  whoa  looks like youve got some dirty ears  well youre not on the banned list so you can go on at 600  600 looks like youll be my opener   tony wonder       you like bread   yeah  have some   wow its warm  how did you do that  oh ho ho magicians only   i folded it up into some squares and i put it in a pouch under my shirt  and then i pull it out and i make it look like it came out of my skin   wow that sounds easy  keep it to yourself  and good luck up there tonight and you youll get there someday  i started out as a little w somehow i became a big one  i dont even know how it happened all right    my eye      enjoy the hanukkah cookie man  what a cool guy   tobias had been sent to the office by george sr  my name is dr tobias fnke  and ill be filling in for michael who is not sick   in fact just today i saw a sliver of his buttocks  and theyre as fresh and firm as a georgia peach so not to worry  but before you all rise up and say well lets make this man our leader  well i think that wont be necessary after you see this  is this right   meanwhile lindsay had also violated michaels authority  and was teaching george michael to drive  sure you dont want me to watch you for a while  driving is about confidence george michael jam on it it feels great right   now put your foot on the brake theres a light in a half mile     meanwhile buster and gob had begun  the sword of destiny illusion at the gothic castle     ahah ahah ahah ooh whoo  stop it buster   and now our magic trick   illusion  silence slave  in this magic trick im going to put a sword   through my assistants tummy  no patter  may i have the trick sword please  its a real sword master   ohho       ooh hoo hoo hoo  weve got em im gonna milk this for a minute   okay          my hand my hand     and the audience wasnt the only one impressed by the performance  bravo hey give us a sec would you candida  my brothers widow its  up  hey so the accident angle right on   oh thank you very much  no thank you  the howd he do dats ate it up  sorry thats what we call the audience  no li know i know about all that used to have a solo act  there

subway sub club card  thats a magician  oh it still needs three stamps   michael hadjust come around from his appendectomy  give me the phone i want to call george michael tell him im okay  hes on his way here we passed him on the road  he was doing really well had his first hopon  what are you talking about hes driving i told lindsay not to teach him   i was going to videotape that hopon  hey dad howre you feeling  bad george michael i just found out lindsays teaching you how to drive  yeah shes still trying to get the stairs unwedged from the emergency room overhang  i was gonna teach you just forget everything she told you and well start over  oh for gods sake tobias is right   what  you have to control everyones life  i dont know where you get that from oscar stop licking that sore   im not  well the operation went pretty smoothly  but once i got in there the appendix wasnt so inflamed doh   i knew it  okay well can we get me out of here  i gotta retrain my son how to drive and i need to stop by the office   to make sure my business doesnt go to hell  and not so fast michael  there seems to be a bacterial infection from the operation   which left an abscess in your abdominal wall  ew  i know its pretty gross it could heal on its own  but i say we go in there dr steinstyle and cut it out  i want to show these interns what the best doctor in southern california can do   well i respect your decision  ill check on you soon  michael this crazy point youre trying to make about respecting authority is absurd  and one day youre gonna wake up and find out it has caused you nothing but trouble   and you are peeing again   and as the anesthesia took hold  michael realized he was going to wake up to nothing but trouble  the fbi has pinpointed the location of escaped convict george bluth today  thanks to a tape turned in by a rabid and disgruntled employee  the fbi has matched the design of the attic to one of saddam husseins iraqi houses   and it appears his son is with him  this is my demand  booyah   buster and gob were waiting to meet with tony wonder  all right hes gonna lowball us so just let me do the talking all right busty  this dvd is the destiny the sword has chosen for me  i wonder where he is  did somebody say wonder  he just appeared out of nowhere in front of that dumbwaiter   actually hed been hiding inside the dumbwaiter for over 20 minutes   waiting for someone to use the word wonder   i wonder where he is  oh hey youve got a piece of lettuce on your shoulder  tada  part of the trick so lets get down to business shall we  hey can you uh go wait with the other assistants over there   what  no whatever you say to me you can say to him  i grant him magic sanctuary   uh you grant me come on you cant just make up   thats fine  i second the sanctuary but with a clause of silence  so i want you guys to be on use your illusion only now its allusion with an a  so if you guys want to put an allusion in there somewhere  like you know poe or something or dont do poe cause im doin poe   what about chaucer  just not poe okay  and uh i dont think we need uh your assistant   what  eh clause of silence  look my assistant is my partner i need him  for what buster huh youre the magic  check out those moves youre doin man theyre in their own orbit  look at tiagra my girl dont look at her  cause you look at her and it affects her in a way that i dont feel comfortable with  or go for it i dont care whatever im just sayin its your world  all right you know what the trick is on you tony wonder  im the magician hes the assistant we dont need him  the real sword of destiny trick hasnt even been performed yet tada  whoa whoa whoa whoa wait  are you tellin me that you have a multistage trick with hidden identities  thats right and im gonna perform the real trick this afternoon   i guess well see what you can do then  i guess we will    ow darryl i told you to move that  chair 10 times  and clean the  dumbwaiter while youre at it  oh i was really hoping for a graham cracker  that would have been a good spot for a trick   michael awoke from his second surgery  morning sleepyhead   did you get the abscess  well uh we had a little whoopsie  see we got the abscess but i think we might have left some snippers in there  its not very likely but one of the assistants having taken them is even less likely   unless i left them in my scrubs  michael good news  they think george is in iraq all the pressures off him  that was on the news i thought that i dreamt that   oh theyre gonna think that im there ow  but not to worry  tobias said hes handling it with the fb i  and the employees have everything under control  no thats the worst thing possible  they think the companys in trouble and that im in iraq  i gotta get down there i need your car keys   and so michael and george michael headed to the office   right here gentlemen   which is how tobias missed him  michael bluth is not in iraq  michael back to bed with you you look awful   michael rushed to the office only to find that his worst fears had come true  were too late its gone everybody said that i was too controlling  but i walk away for one minute look what happens to the company  i mean this is why i didnt want damn it  dad you should probably take it easy  i said that this would happen i said respect my authority but no one would listen  everybody had their own better id ow   and maybe it was the stress or even the misplaced snippers  but michael had never felt worse  however thanks to taking on his authority the employees had never felt better   ted  oh hey michael good news  we leased the top floor to another company and moved down here  but we can stay in business without having to build the extra houses  we did it we did it     youre goin down right  whoo     and back at the gothic castle gob was performing his illusion  hey after i cut the candle in half switch out the real sword for the fake one  what are you doin im gob bluth  im the real magician this man is only the assistant     buster the sword  handle first handle first      oh my fingers  he cut off my  fingers    oh  no        guy is good damn good   bravo   im not kidding he cut off my  fingers   i didnt know we had taquitos   more more   and michael came to a decision  you know what george michael  i think im going to give up some of my authority starting now  you drive home all right   unfortunately michaels decision to let his son  drive a car with a more responsive gas pedal     was not a good decision  your legs gonna be fine michael  and i wouldnt worry about getting hit by any more cars  ive shortened your calf muscles to theoretically increase your jumping ability  but if it works i could be the best in the world  i want the other doctor back   on the next arrested development   michael gets a new roommate  your fingers have been perfectly reattached  go ahead take a look  my middle finger and index finger are  switched for the first time ever   nice job frank  amazing   and the fbi finds footage more troublesome than theyd originally thought   it appears there was something else on the videotape  we think its a terrorist training film  youre not half the man he was   this kids got moves
