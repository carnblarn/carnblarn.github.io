driving his fathers car     why dont you just take your precious portable  stairway vehicle youre always  trying to convince us is a car  yeah that would be great  except our brotherinlaw  left it in an airport parking lot  from whence it came huh   in fact tobias had  intended to park the familys only vehicle  at the airport parking lot  but was waved on to the tarmac instead  where he found a spot close to his gate  here you go uncle gob i had to use two sticks  to support all the extra chocolate and nuts  hey hey hey hey hey whoa  two sticks and extra chocolate  is it mardi gras what are

though i had to ride  my bicycle to work all week  oh dads car  well obviously im gonna  use it if its an emergency   lindsay had such an  emergency three days earlier  when her salon was able to  squeeze her in at the last moment   gasps that colors discontinued  i have to get ready for the bachelorette auction  the bachelorette auction  you know youre married  you just go to dinner with  the guy its for charity  thats what you said about posing  for the ladies of literacy calendar  the one with the pictures of all  the 30yearold women in lingerie  with their nipples covered  by copies of oliver twist  yeah that made a big  difference for the young ones  it would have if it didnt  get banned from the schools  come on face it you do all this  charity crap just to stroke your ego  you dont even know what  the auctions for tonight   the wetlands  to do what with them   dry them  save them  from drying which is more than you would ever do  youre like the least charitable person i know  i dont do anything for myself  everything that i do is for this family  oh you dont do it for us michael  you just do it because you  love being the guy in charge  cause you love saying no like you said  to gob when he wanted a frozen banana  and even after he gave you the rights  to his mr bananagrabber character  you know what i will start doing my  charity work when you start doing yours  in the meantime wheres the car  i think buster has it i  dont know its on the schedule  there is a schedule  i always try so hard not to look at this thing    so michael went to  find buster  who let you in    so michael went to  find buster  who let you in  your new cleaning woman what happened to luz  supposedly luz had to take  her daughter to the hospital  thats lupe her sister   god i hope

you cant possibly  tell me that you care about the wetlands  i care about going for more  money than lucille austero   in fact lucille  bluth had made sure of that  lucille   i got you tickets to the producers  i already saw it in new york  but thats of no use to a woman whose  vertigo makes flying a grotesque misadventure  you must have scrimped and saved for these  but isnt this the night of the auction   is it  you seem pretty confident  oh i think theres a certain bachelor  who wont mind coming home  with me at the end of the evening   buster  where did he go  buster  why do you hide every time the doorbell rings   im not  hiding    buster was hiding from lucille austero  after inadvertently flirting with her at a  social event while not wearing his glasses  lucille had been pursuing him ever since    lucille 2 buster hi  its me again   gasping  ive still got those producers  tickets and id love to share them with you  i dont want you to think im  taking this more seriously than you  are and unless youre planning  some grand romantic gesture  my feelings are just the teensiest bit hurt   what are you going to do  bid on you   how much  ten thousand dollars   when  when they call my name  no theyre not going to call your  name theyre going to call my name   good grief  hey busty you been using dads car  no uh well yes   you got the keys  uh  probably in my school pants

but i guess you get them first  yeah   wait i  need my rape whistle back  you got all your stuff out of the car  yeah i left my um homework in  the backseat but i can get it later   okay  okay  whistle blows   chuckles help   michael surveyed  the damage to his fathers car  the partially excavated  skull the spilled nail polish  the burned seatsand he  came to an important decision  well im getting some ice  cream i can tell you that right now   michael now  able to drive to prison  confronted his father about the permits  how come you didnt tell me  that you didnt file them  im under a lot of pressure im trying  to get my newsletter off the ground  and im trying to decide  which gang to align myself with   is it pledge week already   ive got it down to two  but honestly i just dont even want to choose  i just feel i feel like  the prettiest girl at the dance  listen about that permit  thing thats an easy fix  just break into the permit office  slip the application into the next file  then you tell them you  know hey you guys screwed up   im not doing that dad   michael you lied to your investors  you gotta make that right call gob  hell handle it thats  what thats what hes for  thats what hes for  you better tell him im asking i  dont think hes gonna do it for you  after you wouldnt even give  him a frozen banana michael   what is there a chat room that  you guys   thats not charitable  never mind ill tell gob  that you want him to do this   okay i got a dance i gotta get  ready for   whoa theres really a dance  i dont know both sides  are making a lot of promises  you should call this a gob guy  gob can i talk to you for a sec  listen um im really sorry about before  i said some things and i  got a little carried away  its not the way youre  supposed to treat a brother  especially one that i value so highly  oh i need a favor   that was subtle  whistle   did you just whistle  i  had to buy a candied apple  when you denied me a banana so yeah  im whistling  whistling continues  satisfied   its not  that noticeable listen   dad would like for you to  break into the  permit office   dad  dad said he wanted me  for that   yes he did  will you do it    maybe i have some conditions    whistling terms  boy   one condition and one term  all right   lets have the condition  first   free  banana whenever i want   single dip  double  dip but ill

your son  you better let me do the talking   george michael  your uncle has a request  one bluth banana george michael  go ahead give it to him  gob deserves your respect  and from now on i want you to do  whatever he asks you to do okay  after all he is your uncle and i  think we ought to just embrace that  thank you   have i  held up my end of the deal  i cant believe i gave you animation rights  i hope that doesnt come  back and bite me in the ass   meanwhile lindsay  wanting to prove to michael  that she was a charitable  person joined a group of activists  dedicated to preserving the wetlands  yeah hi im gonna need a taxi  i dont know if that smell is you the car  something you ate or  something youre about to eat  but my god youre in a service business     hello  im in the wetlands  ive got a poker thing  and im gonna clean them up  so the next time you wanna  tell me that im uncharitable  why dont you just ask yourself  who called you from the wetlands  who is this   nice  try youre the selfish one  now if youll excuse me  ive got some nature to save        while lindsay was finding  it difficult to be truly charitable  michael was looking for an  opportunity to rise to lindsays challenge  and thats when he recognized his  mothers fillin housekeeper at a bus stop  hello there youre not riding the bus today  get in this car im not  taking no for an answer come on  dont make me get out of this  car and put you in here myself   thats right here we go   unfortunately the woman he picked up  wasnt lupe but was a total stranger  and upon seeing bones a shovel  and what appeared to be blood  she realized he wasnt who she thought he was  mister please  spanish  this is gonna be tricky i dont speak spanish  yo escared  uhhuh   izquierdo i know that one  left turn it is mrs they call me selfish   michael thought he was  helping his mothers housekeeper  but he had the  wrong woman    guess it would just be a guy who  you know grabs bananas and runs  or uh a banana that grabs things  i dont know why would a  banana grab another banana  those are the kind of  questions i dont wanna answer     hello   lindsay oh  michael its so beautiful here   you have to come down and see  this   im a  little busy right now  ive got someone else in the car with me  and im not going anywhere  until shes taken care of  look i screwed up okay  im lost and i hate them i

gotta make a little detour okay  so i hope no ones waiting for you   in fact the  woman michael thought was lupe   did have people waiting  for her    and they had reported her missing  the real lupe however was  leaving lucilles for the evening   buster l  oh  chuckles hello  it appears my onetime admirer  is not planning some grand  romantic gesture after all   chuckles you know what its his loss  its his loss its his loss   gob meanwhile  was casing the permit office  following the first rule of  surveillance never get noticed  carrier express  whistles    gob realized he needed a new plan  so i need you to give  your father a message for me  all right you heard my dad i  have to do whatever you ask me to  right i forgot about that  all right take this lockpick set  break into the permit office for me   no i think i better check  with my dad first  well  youre gonna break into a  permit office sweet can i come   and george michael saw  a chance to get closer to maeby  you know my dad hates to  micromanage lets just do this   and back at the wetlands  lindsay finally found her taxi  oh good lord you smell worse than before   oh my god  its me    and in her haste to leave the wetlands  she forgot to call michael  hey hey stay there what are you  doing get in the car dont move  lindsay linds  come on im tired of looking  shes not here  she probably never was here she set me

office breakin  so i say to michael if its  so important to dad  whistling  ill look past your selfishness and do it  theres a dentist in here who uh  took liberties with his patients   im gonna ask him to look at  whatever is happening  with you   thanks pop  hey my stock is never gonna be  higher with his gang than it is right now   yeah so have you uh  made a decision  or   sighs  i dont know

oh honey  youre not supposed to show up as the wetlands   while lucille was waiting  for buster to show up and bid on her  buster was waiting for the  other lucille to leave  for what he assumed was the producers  but was now in fact the bachelorette auction  and lindsay was finally up for auction  which michael arrived just in time to see  what do i hear for lindsay bluth  gentlemen  its a good cause   and as  michael looked at his sister  uncertain whether her face was red  from embarrassment or the sun damage  it was clear she had been  in the wetlands that day   one thousand   people gasping  seriously  sold to the man who  truly knows what charity is   and now ladies and gentlemen the  lovely lucille   move move move move  who is the  lucky bachelor   and buster showed upjust in time   ten thousand dollars   gasps      buster   to  bid on the wrong lucille    gasping  how  grand       stammers  how terribly grand    whimpers   sighs  well how embarrassing my own  brother
