to boston where  theyve become celebrated  for their wine and cheese fundraisers  oh no im completely stuffed  michael and his sister havent spoken in a year  neither has acknowledged this  and this is gob michaels oldest brother   so this is the magic trick huh  illusion michael a trick is  something a whore does for money  or candy   gob recently  started the alliance of magicians  an organization that blackballs any performer  who reveals a magicians secret  and finally theres buster   hey buster  the  youngest of michaels siblings  you know you dont need to  do that buddy its

been discovered though  by like magellan and corts   oh yeah yeah  all those folks  those guys did a pretty good job  but theres still you know   he also suffers  from crippling panic attacks  yes this is his family  so why is michael so happy  because hes decided to never  speak to these people again  michael was feeling more  generous about his family  on the morning of the boat party  what comes before anything what have we  always said is the most important thing   breakfast  family  family right i thought you  meant of the things you eat   this is michaels son george michael  i mean

to live  here in the model unit  ofhis fathers latest housing tract  the guys live in the attic so that the house  can still function as a pristine selling tool  and when i do get that promotion  ill finally be able to get you what you deserve  like a real home  this is a real home  no its not its a fake home son  you want the loops or the flakes today   the guys then  headed down to balboa island  so george michael could work  at the frozen banana stand  his grandfather started in 1953  bananas  michael meanwhile was meeting his brother gob  hoping to discuss his fathers boat party  do you

night  bluth development company  president george bluth  was arrested tonight for defrauding investors  and using the company as his personal piggy bank  more intrigue on the high seas tonight  as dozens of local pirates were arrested  for protesting the yacht  clubs discriminatory policies   even michaels  brother gob made the news   mispronounces gob it was mr  bluths son gob a parttime magician  who hid his father here in the aztec tomb  by pushing on this pivoting panel  i have to think the  alliance is gonna frown on this  perhaps a good trick for a human  but the dogs found him almost instantly   free at last darlings   im all right  thank god  oh what an adventure oh my goodness  buster dont do that  what an adventure gang  i thought that the homosexuals were pirates  but it turns out that most of them  were actors in the local theater   chuckles  youre right though it is amazing  ive been waiting for the  universe to provide a path for me and  and i think it has   youre gay  no no  im not im not gay no lindsay  how many times must we have this  no i want to be an actor   chuckles  okay guys um they are  gonna keep dad in prison  at least until this gets all sorted out  also the attorney said theyre gonna have to  put a halt on the companys expense account   all gasping  interesting i would have expected  that after the keeping dad in jail  you know michael dad did  name mom as his successor   and im putting buster in  charge    gob  thats a good choice  buster the guy who thought  that the blue on the map was land   hes had business classes  wawawawait  eighteenthcentury  agrarian business  but i guess its all the same principles  are you at all concerned about an uprising  thats it im done im sick and tired of  the greed and the selfishness and the taking  forget it ive got a son to think about  and lindsay by the way i  expected this from them  because theyre completely oblivious  but you you should know better   in the days that  followed lindsay had no choice  but to check her family out of  the hotel earlier than planned  and her husband started looking for work  my name is dr tobias fnke  i was chief resident of  psychiatry at mass general for two years  and i did my fellowship in  psycholinguistics at mit  and this is im a bad bad  man from annie get your gun    piano      lucille was finding it  difficult to go about her daily life  the sec is making him out to be some kind  of mastermind which  believe me hes not  the man can barely work our shredder  michael was able to secure a job with a  rival housing company almost immediately  well set you up in arizona  in one of our finest estates  attic or main house   laughing   and buster was  discovering his academic pursuits  didnt fully prepare him  for his new responsibilities  have you looked at the latest  figures on the sudden valley expansion  visvis the development versus the tax   you guys are so  smart  two percent  per annum this is a nonrecoupable  we need michael   we need ice    muffled michael we need michael   and so the  family staged an intervention  im sorry what exactly is this intervention for  we need you to come back and run the business  okay so technically  its not really an  intervention its more of an imposition  whatever you  want to call it  id love to call it an imposition  were in trouble here  michael and

  in fact michael had not  spoken to his father since the arrest  and he decided to give his father  the courtesy of a formal resignation   i quit  probably a good career move  you know i parked in the same  spot for the last five years  i was there on time every single day  mike   i was so loyal i worked so hard   why didnt you just put me in  charge   michael listen to me  these guys the sec  theyve been after me for years  i put you in charge youre gonna be  wearing one of these jumpsuits too   i couldve helped  youd be an accomplice  no it had to be your mom  they cannot arrest a husband

youre gonna pull a  muscle   i used  to be able to do this   so michael  decided to stay in california  and try to save the family business  and for the first time ever he  gathered his family together in the model home   dad was always banker so  there was no  beating him  totally  he shouldve been stocking up on  those get out of jail free cards   good one george michael  very good  two
