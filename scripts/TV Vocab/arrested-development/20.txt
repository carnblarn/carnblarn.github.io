line   a matter ofland mom  oh thats funny  i meant a matter ofl  and d life and death  what is the matter of life and death  busters jaw clicks when he eats  i think its whats driving his friends

teacher made an example of him   michael had been suspended  when another boy cheated offhis test  tracy wont marry me i wont get a job and   shushing  what is this whats happening  let mama take care of it  ill have a little chat with mr vandenbosch  the next day mr vandenbosch was not in school  he was never heard from again  i know life is not fair to women your  children grow up and  they dont need you anymore  and i seem to remember  a certain grown man  who completely fell apart two weeks ago  when i taped over the nova special  that had the girl on it he liked  that was buster thats my point   george michael  meanwhile was at the frozen banana stand  when he thought he spotted a familiar face  poppop  sorry miss  chuckling poppop   you think you  saw poppop  but  with hair which is probably why   he asked for my hair  remember  give  poppop your hair   give me the hair  it all adds up  he stole somebodys hair made  a wig knocked out the guard  tunnelled his way through a sewer line  and then stopped to get a candy apple   on his way to mexico  of course   youre mocking me   scoffs of course  listen i know what i saw maeby  and theres no other explanation  so listen my twin brothers in  town i want you to take care ofhim   you still see uncle oscar  tell you what  give him ten grand from the uh new cash   just send him  on his way  dad  the money is for the business okay  im not just gonna  hand it all out   michael  this is my brother do you know  what its like to have a sibling  who has no source of income except for you  just one no no idea it sounds wonderful though  look the board is watching every move i make  especiallyjordan hes just waiting for me  to screw up so he can blow the whistle on me  why dont you just buy him out of his stock  no no he wants twice the value but  listen stop tellin me what  to do with the money please  ive got a plan for the board meeting thats  gonna take the gun right out ofjordans hand  listen youve got the money  now and you know my price  you dont need a whistleblower around here  interesting choice of words mr jordan  hes right we dont need a whistleblower  we need a building full of whistleblowers  okay whistles  i want this place to be honest thats  exactly why i had these made up for us   when you see something  wrong i wa   whistles  there you go i want you to  report it i want you to    whistles  exactly just like that   i want us to police  ourselves as  vigilant    lets wait till something actually  happens though okay good fun  chuckles  all right hey enough   okay theres still three whistles left out there   whos got the whistles   whistles   he kept one  theres a  good example of whistleblowing  but youve kept yours so its hurting your case   i was in the bathroom when you  asked for it  back      no he wasnt  in any event  we are going to be responsible with this money  michael i hope im not interrupting anything   but id love to get a hunk of  that new company  money    i just need to prove to my  wife that i can act like a man  and its not about sex i dont just  lie there if thats what youre thinking   thats not what i was  thinking  sorry i just   a quick question for  michael  is  this about the money   no  chuckles  what do you want  its not about money in the sense that im  saying here michael take some money  its just more of a may i  have some kind of visit  dont you have a wife that you can ask now   she left me  for tobias   she left me  for tobias   for me  no   she doesnt  even like you  im  in love with your brotherinlaw  youre in love with your own  brother the one in the army   no your sisters husband  michael michael   no thats your sisters  brother  im  my sisters brother   youre in love with me  me  im in love with tobias   my brotherinlaw  i know  it can never be so im leaving   im enlisting in the  army  to be  with your brother  no   anyway i  cant be expected to live  on the 800amonth  armywife stipend that im gonna get  they just dont support the spouses  you dont want to end up like uncle oscar  okay living off handouts your whole life  why dont you come up with a way to make money  a suggestion of something to invest  in or maybe uh maybe a business idea  well ive always wanted to remake annie hall  except i wouldnt want to get in bed with a  green producer like a sofia coppola though  oh but give me an old pro like a robert redford  oh id jump into bed with him in a second  and i wouldnt just lie there michael bluth  if thats what youre thinking  actually that time that was what i was thinking    chuckles   and later that day  maeby spotted something interesting  lindsay meanwhile arrived at the  salon hoping to increase her selfesteem  unfortunately her stylist hadjust  been called up by his reserve unit   whats happening where are you  going  im  not allowed to tell   its the war  come on  these salon wars have got to stop  the war lindsay the real war  lindsay was stunned notjust  that she was losing her stylist  but that apparently there was a war going on  well im protesting this war youre my friend  and im not gonna let shauna cut my hair  im going to take a stand   and lindsay found a  solution to her selfesteem problem  gob and tobias meanwhile were  brainstorming at a local coffee shop   i need a cup of coffee to  focus  its  so crowded in here  i cant think okay what is it that people need  people love to carboload   the bagel place  there you go  hey guys  whats goin on  just researching our investment  oh yeah coffee places ive thought about these  ill tell you what you guys come  up with a proposal well try one   gob and tobias  accidentally had michael on the hook  and they didnt want to blow the deal  i guess thats a response   hey nephew  oh hey  chuckles  uncle oscar how are you doin   wow you are like like a  rock   chuckling groaning   oh the tension come on   oh okay thats plenty   okay thats the pancreas  right there   whats happening now   chuckles uneasily   the two men reconnected   neither one anxious to bring up  the issue at  hand  one on the lips  obviously dads in prison now im  running the business a little bit differently  you do the best with what you have   yeah   i have lemons i make lemonade   thats a very positive attitude  i hate the lemonade business i hate the  grind you have to grind so many  beeps   lemons  youre not a very  metaphorical person are you   i need money  i know   sighs ah i cannot tell  you how that has weighed on me     mm  why dont we sit over here  so ive got too many  people watching me too closely  so if youre willing to work or  if you have something of value  the only thing i have of value is my land  i could give you the rights  to all you need are smiles  that was a song i wrote for david cassidy  he was gonna sing it on the mike douglas show  but he was too embarrassed to  do it in front ofjohn and yoko   tell me about the land   its a couple hundred acres  of lemon groves right near camp pendleton  if youre willing to part  with that land uncle oscar  i can guarantee you a little  bit more than that 10000  to be honest ive often thought of  giving it up to pursue mymy lost love  the love that was taken from me     i hope  that was the espresso machine   michael made  the trip to survey the land  it was indeed beautiful  and the next day he went  to his father to tell him  you give that gift  to my brother   gift no  i did not give him a gift i told  you the money was for investing   and thats exactly what i  did with it  pop  oh michael  this guy has got nothing in his  life he wrote one song that  madejoan baez call him the  shallowest man in the world  he has a worthless piece of  property and yes a head of hair  only because hes never had to work for a living   wait what piece of propertys  worthless  the  grove where he lives  i mean you cant build on it the  government has an easement on it   does oscar know this  of course he knows it  i mean they run their  their tanks through there  occasionally they stop for a  little lemonade but whats that  thats a buck fifty you  cant make much from that  indeed the land was  valueless     fellas fellas  so tell me about this investment you made   back at the model  home lindsay had decided  not to take her  stylists departure lying down  im protesting the war  theres a war going on you know  yeah im the one who told you and  you said it happened ten years ago  hey isnt this the same sign you  used to picket the cable company   when they dropped the style  network    actually i used this one  for michael when he was too cheap  to pay for the premium channels  but i added the bit about the stylists  you know that secret you have  the one about the hair  that nobodys supposed to see   hai  i saw it   oh  i saw poppop  oh right poppop with hair   you know i should tell my  dad about   no you  beeps  he might need us to help him so  we should go check out the prison  and make sure hes  not there      michael was embarrassed  about the bad investment hed made  and was hoping to keep it a secret  hi this is oscar im off pursuing my lady love   leave a message ill get back  to you next  summer   beeping  hey its michael i know that  you think that youve disappeared   but i will find you   beeps   whos disappeared  no one   why do you ask have you  seen someone   ive seen no one   then you havent seen anyone  that looks like  poppop  no why  has someone who looks like poppop disappeared  no course not  have you seen the agricultural report  nothings hotter than  coffee so the trend is up  so if we could get that check from you  im not just gonna hand out a check okay  you gotta come up with an investment plan   you gotta call  oh  weve got an investment plan   gobias industries  go bias  hmm   as in go buy us some coffee  its great looks good  so when do i start makin my moneys  well um there uh there may not be  as much investment capital as we thought  uh moneys kind of tied up in this land deal  this is the first any of us at gobias  industries have heard of a land deal  we could  borrow on that land  theres not much to borrow against  the deal seems to be bad  its uncle oscars land and it may be worthless  and the board okayed it   they werent notified  damn it every time dad does this to us   gob dad  really wasnt  he  went around you around the board   he steamrolled gobias   yeah what are you gonna do  go down to that prison and  give him a piece of my mind   you dont need to do that  no im doing it  no because youre in charge  now and im telling him that  no no no no listen gob hes human  hes a human being and letlet me  try to get us out of this you know  let me just see if i can get dad out of this  mess that he has created for himself okay  im afraid this offer comes off the table  at midnight tonight  maybe the worst bluff ive ever seen   even the members  of gobias agreed on that one  the next day lindsay having  heard about a military exercise  joined a protest group and went off to  exercise her own first amendment rights  this way thank you  right here this way  i ask you to make sure youre  fully inside the free speech zone   before beginning your  protest  free speech zone  this is where were protesting this  isnt right where are the cameras  theyre in the free press zone and if  you could save your comments until  youre completely loaded into the cage  well at least the procession will  come through here theyll see us protest  actually theyre using their  right to cut through the lemon grove  okay have fun enjoy your right to free speech  the armed forces welcomes your dissent  well hopefully somebody  will come by we can protest  my grandkids what a surprise   oh hes here  of course  im here where else would i be  well we thought you broke out of  prison and were on the lam with stolen hair  dont you think that if i got out  of here i might want to go home  thats what we thought but then my dad  told us about that lemon grove you bought   and we thought you were going  there  yeah  but dont worry  we would never blow the whistle on family  what lemon grove   and so michael  went back to the board  to take  responsibility for his mistake  my dad screwed up he bought  something that he shouldnt have  but i guess guess thats why hes behind bars  yeah and hes not allowed to  conduct any business from there   inhales right yeah i was  involved it wasnt all his decision  you see it was his idea and  then i carried out the transaction  thats even worse conspiracy to commit fraud  course you can always buy me off the board  we dont have the money anymore  and i assure you that  nothing illegal has happened here  ive misspoke   my dad in no way is talking about  business from  prison     excuse me your  fathers calling from prison  he wants to talk about the land  deal you made with his brother   i found this on your desk  can i keep this   whistles  back at the free speech zone lindsays  protest had started to gain some attention  but not from any key decision makers   thought we were seein a gay  marriage  we can  still hose em down   what do we want   indistinct chanting   what do we want     yelling indistinct  wheres everyone going   what are you giving up   face it lindsay theyve won  well im not going anywhere  all your waters doing is  whetting my appetite for protest  no hair for oil no hair for oil  fine well drown you out with music   crank it up im in the  mood to dance      volume increases  and lindsay discovered that  the activism that came out  ofher desire for prettier hair  really did boost her selfesteem  while michael with nowhere else to turn  made a rare  unsolicited visit to his mothers   michael  yeah  i hope youre here to bring me  a check for busters surgery  they made him stop eating after midnight  and hes hungry and hes in a foreign land  and his jaw is clicking and hes scared   i dont have the money all  right mom   then why are you here  i dont know i dont know  so hows work  itsits not great mom since you asked  itsits just its not that great you know  i got a board member whos trying to extort me  and a seller i

something up mom  li did it and dad is  just you know furious at me  and he should be you know he told me  to pay off his brother and i didnt  instead i bought his worthless land  with the lemons and  the tanks   i know it  first investment i made with the  company money and its a total disaster  then i went ahead and lied about it  which is gonna let this board member  bring the company down  im gonna ruin this family   mom   shushing   continues    whats this whats happening  its going to  be all right   wh  are you squeezing me with your body  its a hug michael im hugging you  why   because you  need your mother right now  but i dont get along with  my sorry that was a knee jerk  michael you made a mistake youre a human being  but youre so forgiving to  everyone else in this family  try

tried to spend on that lemon grove  you got it back how   shushing  you know about what i was saying  about how people outlive their usefulness   that was out of line  i know  but you made a good point  maybe i do need something to  occupy my time other than my children  well if you do want to spend  it together its fine with me  im so glad to hear that   kissing sounds    sighs  all right  lets get this meeting started  why have we been spending  so much money on whistles  on the next arrested development  michael finds having his  mother on the board problematic   we have to be  courageous  i  remember a young man who used to say  but i dont have bad dreams in your bed    laughing wildly  that was buster   lindsay finds her true  calling  i want to be  a cage dancer  laughing   and oscar  comes acourtin      whats that racket     smile
