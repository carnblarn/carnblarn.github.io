                now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything  and the one son who had no choice  but to keep them all together  its arrested development   michael bluth arrived home to find his mother lucille   in a state of agitation  i think the companys in trouble  what tipped you the falling profits  or that were a regular feature on bill oreillys most ridiculous item of the day  im talking about the fact that my friend lucille austero bought our company  and i think shes going for a power grab that bitch  youre not at home mom she doesnt live next door when youre here  secondly shes already grabbed power shes the majority shareholder of the company  ill tell you what she wants to grab your brother gob    in fact lucille 2 was already with gob  you look really nice   but she was growing tired ofhis neediness  where are you going  im going to my spin class     thought you had vertigo  shell sell the company or break it up into little parts or something  all under the guise of caring about our family  gotta stop quoting when you drink i certainly hope shes not planning a move  i wouldnt put it past her shed love to get at me any way she could  thats why shes been flirting with gob  shes trying to prove that shes closer to my children than i am  but the jokes on her because she doesnt know how little i care for gob   think that makes the joke on gob     hey dad  hey buddy  was that gangy who was just  you all right sorry your grandmother had a little accident here  oh does that mean shes gonna have to come live with us  no no no it was it was her drink and even if it wasnt just  do you remember when i bid on sally sitwell at the bachelorette auction  they sent me this basket with all this stuff for our date you know its a whole package  i thought that maybe we could do it together like a valentines present   youre not gonna take sally  sally no no  li wanted it for us i never wanted to be with sally   actually michael had gone over to sitwell enterprises    michael bluth to see sally  one day earlier to set up a date with sally  im afraid shes not here if youd like me to take the package i can give it to her  no no this is uh this is not for her its for my son  just dont tell her i came by   in fact sally wasnt there  and the person michael saw was her father   you kidding this makes me look like my daughter  no ones going to think that  i look like edgar winter forget it i gotta get to spin class  so what do you say we got a basketful of fatherson fun here   whats kama sutra oil   maybe its not for us  ah valentines day which   oh was your mother here  here you all right ill help you up  oh that is quite a basket youve got there michael  that sally sitwell is one lucky lady  well im im not so sure that shes actually right for me anyway  but you got one of these too didnt you yyou bought lindsay at the same auction  well yes but im afraid i prematurely shot my wad  on what was supposed to be a dry run if you will  so now im afraid i have something of a mess on my hands  its justtheres so many poorly chosen words in that sentence   tobias wanted to make sure that everything was perfect for lindsay  so he went to check it out first  oh body chocolate     its a wonderful package ill take it  you just did  why dont you take this i dont have anyone to go with anyway   can you imagine how jealous that would make her   wheres tobias   oh hes just sharing a romantic horseback ride with michael bluth  and theyre dipping each other in   oh you didnt get any body chocolate  li didnt mean with me  li hate to see you struggle like this in fact why dont you let me ask her for you  well michael you really are quite the cupid arent you  i tell you you can zing your arrow into my buttocks anytime  okay you know what you do buy yourself a tape recorder record yourself for a whole day  i think youre gonna be surprised at some of your phrasing   butterscotch want a lick   and later lindsay stopped by the office at michaels request  great thank you listen i want you to take my romance package at the four seas hotel   oh yea  thats great tobias is gonna be thrilled   oh i have to go with tobias  lindsay your husband really wants this to work   come on let me play cupid this year  i thought he went already   im giving you mine  because youre afraid to ask sally sitwell to go with you   thats not true at all  mmm  chawcheechaw cheechaw   what is that is that a chicken  whats this   oh michaels scared to ask out sally  no im not   chawcheechaw  this is priceless   you too this is great come on these arent even birds   i am notthats enough there are people working    listen i think that lucille 2 is up to something  mom said the same thing i thought she was ticked offcause youre seeing her  what youre seeing lucille 2 does buster know  no and im not just dont tell people  im playing the part of the gigolo so that shell keep the company afloat  but something weird happened yesterday when i was trying to find a way out of there    hello      in fact it was stan sitwell calling her  as hed become quite taken with lucille 2 himself  it all makes sense why else would sally sitwell be avoiding me   she thinks youre a loser  and why would lucille 2 be so distant toward me   cause she knows youre a loser  i think its pretty clear  lucille 2 and sitwell are working on a business deal  lindsay id like for you to go over to sitwell and see what you can find out   i cant go there again  why do i have to do that  because youve been helping yourself to the company money for some time  its not like you do anything for the family anyway  gob doesnt do anything for the family  hey im  lucille 2  oh i could do something like that  this is what dad was really good at  getting us out of tight spots   in fact at that very moment george sr was in a tight spot  as hed gotten himself wedged under the furnace  while chasing after a sour ball that had rolled out ofhis pocket     eventually michael rescued him   im starting to worry shes gonna sell us out  i think the answer to this problem is money  now this may just be me having my head against a hundreddegree furnace for an hour  but maybe we should bring in jack dorso   unclejack  well no hes not my uncle hes uh my dads friend  but uh this guy has got a fortune  jack dorso first achieved success in the 40s  as a costar of the radio and then film serial red mcgibbon and bullet nazi hunters  there are two nazis up there in that dance hall    shoot me     happy valentines day nazis   when the actor who played red mcgibbon  was jailed for his communist sympathies  jack dorso made one attempt at a solo bullet feature  but the audience was not ready to accept bullet as a romantic lead  despite his powerful upper body  so he started a chain of gymnasiums  having stolen the idea from red during a prison visit   and as the years passed   hey jack  he became wellknown for his annual birthday feats of strength  five pounds for each year of my life   sadly he lost the use ofhis legs on his 70th birthday    release  at the newlyremodeled jack dorsos in albany new york      too much  if hes got so much money how come we never called him before  but i have i mean there wouldnt be a bluth company without him  i could never have afforded that first tract of land  but he always wants something in return   i dont know  see if you can talk your mother into taking another bullet for the bluth family   the family gathered at lucilles to welcome and solicit unclejack  and remember he wasnt really their uncle  buster nice of you to take a break from that common whore youve been dating  she is not a whore mother she happens to be the new secretary of the bluth company  and yes shes more experienced than a normal girl   but sometimes love should be terrifying   in fact   buster had even started using his army stealth training   buster  ill be right in and then maybe we can talk about   makin that love    i shouldnt complain its better than you dating lucille 2 that bitch  lucille 2s not a bmother shes kind and shes caring  and shes certainly less experienced than that whore that im dating now   and perhaps it was screaming it out loud  that made buster realize that he missed lucille 2  im wondering if you can keep some of the more piercing profanities down  when the 90yearold fitness buff gets here  you know michael i was happy to call unclejack for you  but thats as much as im going to do  if you know what i mean   i need a more vital man     someone order 140 pounds of upperbody strength  well he certainly sounds vital to me   walk dragon walk   enter the room   welcome unclejack  hes half deaf it was a stupid stupid hire  not higher eye level eye level  kisses and then we talk which one is michael   uh  swoop me    oh  i uh really appreciate you coming over unclejack  thank you for having me you may be amazed  uh im invited into very few personal homes  to the nuts  the bridge mix the bridge mix fool  hey fake unclejack  is this the boy is this the little one my god youre an army man   well   i was never in the army i was in the pictures  here comes unclejack shoot me    oh god       look at that i pinned him i pinned the army man  god bless you for being in the army up dragon     lift lift with vigor   remember me  lucille you look younger than you did the day l    oh you old fool im lucille    you look fabulous back to the blonde back to the blonde  isnt she beautiful oh yeah    hes kind of scary that guy huh  not to me i think hes kind of cool  well why dont you go get your kiss from mr cool halfman    id be fine with that  lets go   so whats your point  come on  why shes no bigger than one of my legs  shake them for her   excuse me unclejack im george michael   its okay just ignore it  ignore it just something the body does when youre shaken   dont shake it dont shake it   towel  not the good ones   is he dying what if hes dying    boy that dragons cute huh   what the deaf giant whos holding our fake uncle  hes been flirting with me all night  i was thinking maybe it would be best for the family  if i went on that romance thing with drag instead oftobias  which would be a drag      yeah thats just the kind of joke drag cant hear  no youre gonna go with tobias or not at all now tell me what you found out at sitwell   oh you still want me to do that  you didnt  lindsay i give you one thing to do for the business and you cant even do it  i mean if youd tried and failed id understand but you didnt even try  so i didnt even fail and i dont see you giving me credit for that      michael knew that since lindsay let him down  he had no choice but to ask unclejack for the money to save his company   pretty  yes  do you think you should be perched on the edge of the building like this  oh dragons got me   dragons in the bathroom  mama   come on i got ya i got ya its okay      and so michael laid out his dilemma family company get ruined   i was hoping that this was a social visit  well  particularly when that sister of yours started giving me the cutie eye     she did  unfortunately that moose was holding me so i couldnt make my move  of course i couldnt make that move without that moose but thats my challenge  i wont go wheelchair  twirl me around  hey hey no i got you i got you     you all right  but valentines day is here and im alone  the moose is no one  perhaps if i had a little companionship  id be a little more disposed to whip out  that old wallet of mine  youre saying if i were to set you up with my sister   you would consider bailing us out  oh joy yeah   michael was torn   the business meant the world to him but his sisters honor   lets do it   uh meant a lot too  lets go share the good news   michael had offered his sister to his unclejack  in exchange for money to save the company  remember its not their real uncle   hes cute isnt he  so cute   imagine him without that muscly little old guy in his arms  oh dragon right  well thats why i was thinking maybe you should go with dragon on that romantic getaway   oh  now i know hes working  so unclejacks gonna have to go along  oh well as long as he promises not to shake him   mmm  so what did he say about the money   he said hed like to sleep on it   meanwhile buster had decided to pursue a new girlfriend  his old girlfriend  hey brother what are you doing here  im keeping an eye on the woman who controls our company  in her robe and slippies  getting into her head i think shes planning on selling our company to stan sitwell  but ive lost her trail and i dont think i have the skills to pick it up  skills   these kind of skills  not really  but if you give me one of those outfits we can hide in the bushes and spy on them  i would like to see her again youve got it   and michael told his father the good news about unclejack   you are pimping out your sister  you were pimping out my mother  yes because she was sleeping with my brother but your sister  everythings gonna be fine no ones gonna get hurt  no one is going to get hurt  oh hey michael my dad wanted me to thank you for the romantic getaway  dont tell me what that means   where is your dad  he left dressed all westerny  you could leave me out of that part too   and michael realized that perhaps somebody would get hurt   i just screwed my brotherinlaw  well im all grown up now   so michael rushed to the four seas hotel  to keep tobias from finding out about lindsays date  michael this is jeff he does all the horse work here  youll meet him again at the end plus he gets you your juice  not your first juice but the one you get at the spa   thats right youve done this before  but not with a lovely lady  jeff doubts ones coming at all dont you sorry sorry   about the lovely lady    stop you dropped the boot dropped the boot   michael came up with the only evasion he could think of  tobias the lovely lady shes gonna be a little bit late shes doing some work  she said to get started without her   saddle me up jeff  its gonna take a few minutes to tack another horse   so michael embarked on the romantic adventure hed spent so lavishly for   well you certainly didnt help with my reputation as a ladys man with jeff  but well clear all that up in the spa when i get my facial  hey did you ever get that tape recorder   youre funny come on boy hoochacha   soon the next group began their romantic date   so nice of you to cover this unclejack  my pleasure  its nice to do something you dont need legs for     towel   and lucille 2 showed up with stan sitwell  who did look a little like edgar winter  and one by one they each enjoyed the activities of their romantic getaways   body chocolate  no   of course in the spa  thejets proved too powerful for unclejacks tiny legs  the spa portion also proved challenging to stan sitwell and lucille 2  who in turn were being followed by buster  and gob  and soon michael and tobias awaited their massage therapists     so uh tobias  im afraid that your wife might not actually end up here with you  you know michael perhaps i should buy you that tape recorder  do you have any idea how often you say the word afraid  well i know i used it in thejacuzzi  and i apologize for that i thought it was a pool toy  but you were supposed to be here with sally sitwell  but you were afraid to ask her  so what do you do you create issues and you make up imaginary problems  like this merger i hear youre worried about  well uh youre probably right     about me being afraid of the word no but  you know the mergers real im not imagining that  lucille michael   michael  what are you doing here  following lucille 2 shes with sitwell  she probably figured that wed never track her   but we lost her everyone put on white robes and outsmarted us  lucille lindsay     lindsay  wait wait wait lindsays here with two men  sort of one and a half  tobias hey tobias  lindsay look l oh lucille 2 im sorry   and miss i dont know your name  tobias  lucille sitwell whats this  its our romantic getaway michael  romantic so then the company isnt being taken over  so lindsay doesnt have to be with unclejack  oh tobias we gotta stop lindstobias   howd you like to take a nap baldy   ill handle this  shes my girlfriend pal take him down buster  your girlfriend thats why you were in her robe and slippies  you werent trying to get into her head  you were trying to get into her robe and slippies  shes my girlfriend     so this is who you choose over me   shes not with him shes with the bullet  oh thank god  but if you want a fight you got it shoot me    stop it stop it  look i wasnt trying to sell your company but i am now  the hell with all of you  im gonna try and lowball her   not while were around  were not done here gob   tobias tobias im sorry  i set this up for lindsay lindsay im sorry   you were not on a date with dragon  i know that michael  it was pretty obvious when dragon kept swooping unclejack in for a kiss  you said i never did anything for the company li just thought id try  tobias i never thought youd ever fight for me  i had no idea a 90yearold man could cave in my chest cavity like that  dragon would you mind carrying my husband to the car        oh god  i love takin a guy down  i think i snapped one of his ribs  no its my leg  ill bet that would hurt  i guess the deals off now now that i actually need you to help us out  ill make you a deal you carry me and ill carry you  thanks unclejack   yeah i think we should get to the hospital  let me see  i think this duct tape is the only thing thats keeping the ankle on  okay ah right around there oh i think youre right inside me now   on the next arrested development  unclejack buys the company  but makes some changes ofhis own  and hes gonna make me president     tobias listens to a days worth ofhis own words   to see what michael was referring to     even if it means me taking a chubby i will suck it up   nothing wrong with that   ive been in the film business for a while  but i just cant seem to get one in the can   its out of context     i wouldnt mind kissing that man between the cheeks so to speak   and he realizes there is something distinct about the way he speaks  tobias you blowhard
