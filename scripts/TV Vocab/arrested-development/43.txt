getting pretty serious   they werent   she was just avoiding her   real crush on george michael   that steve sure    knows how to please a lady   good   i was helping he    would be gifted sexually   i guess it    makes sense you know   older guys    expect certain things   they do   what a fun sexy time for you   id be very careful    of these british people   theyre going to try    to get their hands on   any evidence they    can to hurt the family   so youre saying    shred the evidence   no thats illegal   the prosecution is    entitled to that evidence   without it they    dont have a case   so youre saying    shred the evidence   thats a felony  and i certainly couldnt endorse anything like that     got ya   wink   wink   did you say    wink or did you wink   he said that too dad   well talk soon    folks thank you   where you going where    is the surrogate going   stay there   i want to see what hes  going to say dont leave   see you pop  gob instead of trying to impress your fake father    maybe you should spend some time with your real son     steve holts not my son   steve holt   with the moron jock   thats my son you pothead   hey hey hey thats my son  wait so that means   that steve holt is my cousin     and maebys cousin too   i guess   shoot im late for my date   at the kennel   right   sorry you lobbed that one   right over the plate michael   home run   and michael    hurried to the british   section orange    county for his date   american    get out of the road   only to find that    rita had chosen wee   britains one    americanthemed restaurant   oh hello im sorry im late   oh no bother   ive been having such    fun on this space shuttle   strike one huh   shall we go    ahead and sit down  hey dudes ill get you a couple of 64ounce colas     to wash down this basket of   doughnut and get    your nachos started  i guess this is what the british think of americans      they like our food     whatever do you mean   yeah uh   you know rita youre going   to figure this out eventually  but i have not been on a date in a long long time      neither have i     i wonder why   no i bet men ask    you out constantly   not men like you   i seem to only    meet little boys   part of that might be that you   spend your day at a preschool   and they think the    stupidest things are funny  yeah thats a cultural problem is what it is     you know your    average american male   is in perpetual    state of adolescence   you know    arrested development   hey thats the    name of the show   no attention span you know   cant even carry    on a typical conv   michael thought he spotted the   man whod    threatened him earlier   im getting back    on the space shuttle   no no no sorry    sorry sit please   lets talk about you    tell me about your family   no   theyre pushy    bossy want to control me   what about your family   id love to meet your family   michael knew from experience   that this would    not turn out well   if you like the small why   dont you come    back for the medium   i probably should    warn you about my mother   hi   so he came up with a   solution so    simple hed wondered   why hed never    told anyone it before   i dont have a family  i cant believe ive never told anybody that before     thats so sad   yesits sad super sad   shall we eat   michael had    started a relationship by   lying about the    existence of his family   i think this    went really well huh   maybe sometime    we can have dinner   could i see your house   michael was caught    off guard by the question   no no ii cant do that   okay byebye   uh bye   and he vowed not to be    caught off guard again   i didnt mean that   so did he    invite you over then   not yet but he will   so michael went back to work   hey who    brought in the wood   gob you cant shred this   evidence    youll end up in jail   dad told me to   how can i say no to that face   get this stuff    out of here and put   it somewhere where    dad cant get to it   are you in on this too   no im just here to go out   to lunch with your father  the man said hes never felt more free in his life     im like a bird up there   ah did you tell    him about my medal   medal what for   oh who knows    what they were saying  private citizenship and hereby reenlist in    the armed services of the united states of america     if you agree with    this say thank you   thank you wow   i have so many    people to thank    private    ashford step forward   its probably because    a seal bit off his hand  the army has taken to giving medals for being food     just then   its so simple   my ankle monitor only goes   off when go    out the front door   we need balloons   a party   we need to throw a party   for busters stupid thing   larry go get some balloons   and michael found a way to   get rita to his    house after all  thats a great idea   honor buster tomorrow night     well get the    whole family over to   the penthouse    show him our support   well i suppose its    better than drinking alone   what time   it doesnt    matter to me i cant   be there ive    got a date with rita   well moms probably right i   couldnt even    stand up to a seal   i dont real    deserve a medal or a party   no you deserve this   here take my business card   no no its    pronounced analrapist   it wasnt really the   pronunciation    that bothered me   you see buster it wasnt the   seal that you    couldnt stand up to   it was lucille   oh im getting chills   if this was a    lifetime moment of   truth movie this    would be our act break   but it wasnt  and later lindsay was on the phone with bob loblaw     the thing about tobias that   hes never    fulfilled me sexually   can you catalog    for me the various   ways youve been    promised to be fulfilled   whether or not said    promise was made explicit   you want me to be explicit   yes but i will be needing   to get off in four minutes  well lets see if i cant hit that target for you     the next day on the    way to pick up rita   michael stopped    by his house to make   sure there were no    signs of his family   only to discover    there was nothing but   what the hell is all this   oh gob brought    all this stuff in   and mom what is    with all the family photos   oh im teaching buster    to stand up for himself   im surrogating your mother   by wearing her sealskin coat   michael i have tried on   everything and    nothing seems be working   i thought the    donna karan worked   you just didnt    have the right shoes   look ive got    to get rid of any   evidence of my    family and quickly   including you guys   get out of here   see now thats how    you stand up to mother   meanwhile worried about   steve holts    sexual expectations   maeby tried to    cancel her date   my whole family and i now   have to go to    my grandmas house   cause my uncle lost his hand  awesome so you and i can party alone at your house     maeby was too    young to know what to do   ironically in    her afterschool   job as a movie    studio executive   shed just greenlit two films   that dealt    with the very issue   rock the house   all right   george michael also    didnt know what to do   if he pointed out that the two   were cousins to    drive them apart   he might be burning the very   bridge that he one    day hoped to cross   michael im doing    your cousin tonight   so are you   what   shes your cousin too   back at the penthouse party   preparations were underway   hes not wearing that to the   party ive go    the exact same thing   no he was just analraping me   then michael    barged in and kicked us   out so he could    shred all the evidence   shred the evidence   thought he didnt    want us to do that   he didnt want us    to get into trouble   hes taking the heat   hes doing that for us   and on the night    of his date with rita   who he didnt want    to bring over here   probably because    lets face it you   people havent been    great with the others   well in our defense mom   were not exactly dog people   we have got to    start being nicer   im starting right now   buster the partys    not for you anymore   its a welcome rita party   i know where she works we can   pick her up and surprise her   youre so right   this is better    than a party for me   come on grow a pair   you know we need    some weather balloons   for this party and    maybe a tank of hydrogen   you know really    float those suckers   meanwhile michael was hiding   the evidence wherever he could   when he heard    from his brother   hey friend gob here we   really want you at the party   were really nice    now and god we love you   oh damn it   and the family    picked up rita in the   only vehicle big    enough to hold them all   hey excuse me rita   im rita   were here to pick    you up for michael   you can just go in the cabin   michael   oh hes not here   were his family   his family   were nice   im sorry i have to leave   oh no you cant    leave drive lindsay   bye   were doing this for michael   stop her buster   what am i supposed to do    stop her     stop yelling at me   im leaving   and thats when buster   noticed the seal    on ritas backpack   hey talk about cathartic   now thats an act break   buster had    overcome his fear of seals   unfortunately hed done so by   knocking out    michaels new girlfriend   what the hell did you do   you curious mom   i can show you   you made a mistake   youre human   except for the hand   its okay shes alive   and soft soft and alive   all right lets not    add that to the charges   what do we do shes    going to tell michael   and he wont    hear the good stuff   hell just hear    about the beating   wait maybe we can    give her a forgetmenow   here you go hot    dog take the pill   whats a forgetmenow   theyre pills that create a   sort of    temporary forgettingness   so if somebody    finds out how you do a   trick you just    give em one of these   and they forget    the whole thing   its a mainstay of    the magicians toolkit  like how clowns always  have a rag soaked in ether     gob this is flunitrazepam   its a roofie   those are illegal   shut up mom   dont make me give    you another one of these   lindsay help me three   back at the house    michael finished his   work and now late    rushed to pick up rita   moments later    maeby prepared to   tell steve she    wasnt ready for romance   well this    sends a mixed message   just as steve showed up to   call things off    with his cousin   you did all this for me   yes well   im going to go get sexy   and michael missed rita   damn it   strike two   take it down   we dont want anything in   this house that says rita   hi its    michael i will

been caught by a   woman they clubbed    drugged and left on a bench   it was awkward   whos this   mother mother    this is from army   i have to report    for duty tomorrow  it says by accepting this medal i was reenlisting     i didnt hear them say that   perhaps if the sergeant had   spoken more    slowly she would have   in acceptance of    this medal you proudly   waive all rights    to private citizenship   and hereby    reenlist in the armed   services of the    unites states of america   if you agree with    is say thank you   thannk you   what am i going to    do i cant go back there   ive never been   who are these people   this is my family   no no i dont    like these people   me you mean she means me   because i lied    about having a family   because i was

anymore   im getting rid of this thing  it has caused me nothing but pride and selfrespect     buster went to get rid of the   medal he finally    felt he deserved   but it was exactly when   george sr was    making his escape   farewell to you all   but it turns out that hydrogen   is more explosive than helium   and george    michael came home to   find an    unconscious steve holt   what have you guys been doing   i gave him a roofie   a girls got to    grow up sometime   hes your cousin   my cousin   i should have told    you that now youve   drugged him and    had your way with him   how is that even possible   no george michael    we didnt do anything   i just wanted    him to think we did   dont you see i drugged him   not to go all    the way with him   well i think    even the antidrug   people are going    to be okay with that   well lets get    his pants back on   you took his pants off   and michael    tried to salvage the   remains of the    files from the car fire

place   we just wanted to do   something nice    for you michael   because you do so much for us   i guess we screwed it up   well i screwed it up because   i was trying to impress her   and lets face
