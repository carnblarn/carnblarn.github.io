                now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything  and the one son who had no choice  but to keep them all together  its arrested development   michael bluth was working at home when he noticed something unusual    that cant be good  okay i checked underneath and there is a problem   you know this isnt a real house  its a model house  well the drain pipes arent hooked up just empty under the house   plus theres a lot ofblue paint down there  and some pieces of denim   yeah  weve got a guy like that here  well thats why your living room is sinking  and i think the citys gonna have to redtag it  the city is sending out an inspector  theyre gonna be crawling over every inch of this place youre going to need to leave  where the hell do you want me to go back to your mothers  i believe theres a freeloading loser in my bed  buster just lost a hand hes going through a lot  im talking about oscar  oh yes your brother i can see why that would bug you   in fact oscar had stayed with lucille primarily to reconnect with buster   whom he secretly believed to be his natural son  hey uncle  i feel so responsible for that  oscar had gotten injured on a shoddy device george sr had invented   when he forgot buster was wearing a prosthetic hand  buster the cornballer        its my fathers fault  my fault  i was trying to keep you from burning yourself you idiot  i mean yes yes george sr sure rushed this to market  the only reason she likes him is he has hair  and the only reason he has any is because hes never had any stress  yeah well you could save me a lot of stress if you just turned yourself in  no never i cant go back to the joint no i cannot go back there   hey man  yeah   its a hellhole  i finally got the court to try you in absentia  which means were not supposed to have any idea where you are  so you dont have to go to prison but you cant stay here  remember that french movie we tried to sneak into once dangerous cousins  no lwhy did we   i dont remember that no   george michael remembered very well  in fact he currently had a copy of the dvd hidden in his sock drawer  kind of  why do you ask  i got passes to the premiere of the american remake supposed to be great   it wasnt great and maeby knew it  the studio at which shed finagled a job had hoped to avoid controversy  by artlessly explaining that the two leads werent biological cousins   shut up and kiss me   where is everybody  theyve been fired  and you gotta fix this or youre gonna be fired too   cut it down if you have to  but its only 71 minutes long  and its only like 63 minutes long so bring ann  no thats not her kind of thing  i mean if it maintains any of the complex eroticism of the french original anyway  i like the way they think   and later at the office michael had another surprise  this cant be good  michael it saddens me greatly to say to you  that i can no longer work at the bluth company   youve been a great boss  im sorry tobias do you work here  do i work i developed an eating disorder being your assistant michael  i never saw you at the desk  well excuse me if i was too busy on my knees in front of the toilet michael  i have a tremendous opportunity  now that the blue man group has dropped their ceaseanddesist  and invited me to audition in las vegas  also ive developed some issues with food  im sorry to interrupt one more time is this the real blue man group this time   tobias had recently been asked to address a group of depressed men  who had been described over the phone as blue  i feel like a  idiot  fortunately i found a wonderful circle of men to get me through that  oh before i forget your old secretary kitty sanchez called  and wanted to meet with you   i penciled her in for 400 today  why didnt you tell me  oh this is my fault too  everything no no i will not let this make me eat    so get this tomorrow i gotta go on record and say i dont know where dad is  and now kitty sanchez wants to meet with me   and meetings with kitty had never ended well   say goodbye to these  spring break whoo   perhaps thisll jog your memory   oh theyre crooked  plus dad will not leave the attic which means hes gonna get caught  which means im gonna get caught for hiding him  well why dont you get gob to do your dirty work for you  shall i knock dad out and chain him to a pipe somewhere  or should i risk another herpes outbreak with kitty   which is it this time  definitely not one of those two things  but are you upset about something gob  i made you a thankyou gift last week about which you havent said word one  come on you asked me for 5000  so that you could invest in a franklin cd  now i assumed that you were talking about the mutual fund  and not a compact disc of you singing to your hand   gob had recently made a recording ofhis ventriloquism act  franklin comes alive take one  he hoped it would break down racial barriers and maybe be a crossover hit  it aint easy bein white  it aint easy bein brown  all this pressure to be bright  i got childrens all over town  sometimes hey whered the guy go  i tried to express something to you in a couple of those numbers  and maybe just maybe heal this country a little bit  but you you didnt even bother to listen to it  i did listen to it llli am listening to it gob hey  maybe the reason i didnt say anything is cause i didnt want to embarrass you  its my favorite favorite record  well then you you  up   because i am so embarrassed  its a good cd its a really good cd   i cant believe that you love it  i love it so much  oh god oh god look at us  crying like a couple of girls  aw youre the only one crying but i love the music   and the card with your face on it  and the healing  home run  well do your dirty work for you mikey   you leave the rough stuff to franklin and me  now i gotta listen to that cd   hi dad  right  you remember franklin   hey franklin  my man   how bout some tongue  wha oh   but franklin didnt want to kiss at all  gob had soaked the puppets mouth in ether   and downstairs tobias shared his good news with lindsay    once in a lifetime  tobias i am not uprooting my life and moving to vegas  maybe this is a sign that our relationship isnt working and we should split again  wait a second i thought we were split up and this would bring us back together  well maybe the fact that we dont know if were together or not  is a sign that we should split again  or stay split up  okay forget about vegas well stay here and get back together   or stay together and either rekindle or fan this fire     and soon gob was on his way to dump his father on the police station steps  do you forgive me  and he decided to let himself off the hook using his ventriloquist skills   i cherish you gob come here and give me a kiss  im driving dad  now    it was weird    and thats when gob noticed the cd and card that hed made for michael  its not even open michael  meanwhile michaels meeting with kitty wasnt as distressing as hed thought  the program has changed my life and i have a sponsor now  hes famous   thats great  i cant tell you who he is  but lets just say that he was on night court   well you look great  i can tell you who its not  its not bull its not harry anderson   i got it  hes white  i know who it is  what happens is when i dont have a man in my life i tend to go a little crazy   mmhmm  but im keeping it together now  and i wanted to tell you im not gonna try to hurt you guys anymore   dont suppose i can get that in writing  you did try to blow me up   sorry about that  just dont piss me off again       you all right  oftentimes the heart acts without consulting the head and thusly  oh i see you wasted no time in filling my seat hole  oh no no i just came by so that you could say goodbye to these   oh no no no no  its the last time youre going to be seeing these  how ironic i just found out im staying   will you take these back  okay lets just all put our tops down  just put em on down  youre not goin to vegas  sadly my wife said no to my dream  so i shall continue to toil through this waking life  wow you are so real why cant i meet someone like you   and michael decided that he better keep kitty occupied with a man  at least until after his meeting  hey gang i got an idea tobias why dont you take kitty out for the afternoon     huh  are you trying to set up your former assistant with your current assistant  what a great idea for a hugh grantjulia roberts type movie  i recently heard that the actor john larroquette was looking for a meaty character piece   and so free of obstacles  michael prepared to sign the affidavit  maintaining he had no idea where his father was  you have not been in contact with him are you prepared to do that  officers  michael these men are here just a little bit early  because we have photographic evidence  which discredits the affidavit you just signed  are those balls cause the last time we were here they were balls  these are not balls this was taken with a traffic camera  it shows you in your car with your father within the last 24 hours  i wish they were balls   michael was in police custody  after a photo ofhim helping his father escape had turned up  did you see that picture thats you right  were you holdin up a photo of me or somethin  of course you dont recognize it   its the card from the cd you didnt even open  you found that did you  right between the gearbox and the pull back from aircraft lever  so this is how you repay me for how i repay you  i actually did not get a chance to listen to it yet  probably shouldve told you but i didnt want to hurt your feelings  oh youre so sensitive  just like when you whipped up those tears talking about how much you loved it  i will listen to it i promise but im in a lot of trouble here where is dad  ive got him stashed away somewhere safe now   get him quickly otherwise im gonna be stuck in here  good   i hope you rot in here  what  and guess what else dad kissed me  how he looked pretty unconscious in that picture  i didnt say he was totally into it   and george michael tried to break up with ann  i cant go out tomorrow night cause theres this movie premiere at  its kinda racy but  oh the cousin one i cant believe it i was just gonna ask you to go   you want to see that  no i want to get the whole church group together  were gonna picket those bastards   george michael had only heard ann swear once before  when hejoined some ofher youth group to protest the home of marc cherry  executive producer of the hit show desperate housewives   its a satire  theres nothing funny about fornication  the bastard saw us   and the promise of another kiss was too enticing to turn down  well yes the bastards  oscar meanwhile checked in on buster   buster buster be careful   its not a real hand remember  im so forgetful   i hope you dont get that from me  get that from you  do you feel okay      just forget it  i wanted to share my pop secret with you oh but forget it  pop secret  pop se is oscar my real father   lucille meanwhile was on the phone with michael  theyre keeping me overnight could you tell my son im on a business trip   why cant the girl at work do it  tobias  i sent him on a date with kitty to keep her off our backs  you better hope lindsay doesnt find out shell be devastated   find out what  your husbands dating kitty the whore  he is thats thats horrible  do i know my daughter  she only wants what she cant have  since youre devastating people  tell gob ill be telling the cops it was him in the truck  so hell be joining me here  ive got a nice hard cot with his name on it   youd do that to your own brother  i said cot  wheres mother  you lied to me you said my father was my father but my uncle is my father  my father is my uncle   at that moment the guards played a cd theyd recently confiscated   now i got a special thank you to the brother who made this happen  is that franklin   michael realized that he could never turn his brother in   michael   gob meanwhile was having a similar epiphany  barry its gob tell michael not to testify  im bringing in dad  franklin   youve ruined the act gob   and lucille confronted oscar   you told him you were his father  i did no such thing   youre high  youre drunk  not this time ive had enough of you  so say goodbye to these because its the last time   and ann in a protest at the theater  george michael are you protesting this   this isnt the line  yes he is protesting this  he even helped me make the signs  well only mine and the one that says this is a tricky gray area   what are you guys protesting  its a disgusting movie  about cousins who are into each other  are there any more seats  yeah its the best 52 minutes youll spend all day   oh no were making it worse  prepare to be swallowed into the depths of hell   i guess that means no kiss  im not really in the mood for a kiss  this isnt marc cherrys house   wheres your dad  i dont know i just got here  oh thats right mother told me he went to jail   im so mad at her     guess who i just found out my father is  jail  oscar he didnt mean to tell me but i figured it out   no i mean my dad is in jail  i wouldnt worry about it barrys very good  im going to take a long shower i dont even want to smell like mother anymore  i dont think were supposed to shower right now bus   tobias back yet  no  oh my god hes really out with her   are you drunk  not enough  i pushed him right into someone elses skanky bony arms  well let me tell you something george michael  you have to grab love while you have it dont let it get away  oh there you are  oh maeby everythings fine your daddys just out  yeah were doing great  mommys gonna take a bath with a bottle of wine   i dont know if were supposed to use  so get this  all the press actually made the premiere a hit theres lines for the next show  thanks buddy   hey look at that we didnt get swallowed up into hell     and thats when george michael finally got close to maeby  who by the way might not be his biological cousin  just then gob came home to retrieve his father from where hed stashed him   dads gonna be crushed  you dont have to tell him  but gob was referring to his own father  who he had hidden under the house  uhoh   gob had hidden his father under a house that hadjust collapsed  children youre small crawl under there   we dont want to go under there  hes not under there  he got away thank god  but then gob remembered that this meant michael would have to go to prison   we  l  and michael and barry made their way to the arraignment  gob is bringing your father everything is going to work out fine  i wish theyd hurry up but i gotta tell you i am a little torn  my father he has created a lot of problems for the family  and by staying in the attic he was insuring i would go to jail with him but  well maybe im not so torn   michael barry  hey gob   wheres dad  great news dad wasnt crushed to death   was there risk of that  yes  well i handcuffed him under the house  but he got free the pipes i chained him to werent connected to anything   oh im not prepared for this case  are you insane   no thank you for trying  im sick of you needing constant validation for screwing up  let me tell you whats gonna happen im gonna tell them it was you in the stair car  well let me tell you whats gonna happen  first im gonna beat the crap out of you then im gonna call an ambulance  then knowing you im gonna have to wait for some kind of an apology     come here   as the boys set to once again fighting in front of the courthouse    stop it stop it  the family began to show up for the arraignment  i know youre in the middle of something but im afraid i cant work for you today  im going to vegas with kitty   but lindsay wasnt about to lose her man without a fight  over my dead body   oh my   hey hey i said i said enough  now stop it  i am so tired of this family fighting the anger ends now  youre brothers and brothers stick together no matter what  families stick together  i have torn this family apart with my lies and my cowardice  but that comes to an end now  so im turning myself in  i dont want you to come and visit me in prison this time  cause you deserve oscar now  tobias i actually fought for you  i cant believe it    im going to vegas with kitty  huh  oh george ive lost you again  take back oscar mother  i think i lost him too   in fact oscar was on his way out of town  when he was approached by george sr  who hadjust escaped from under the house  i want you to turn me in so you can get the reward take care of the family  why would you do that for me  because were brothers  later while george sr was shaving his unconscious brothers head  he wondered whether there really was a reward and ifhe could get it  but there was no time and getting even with his brother was reward enough  so it was oscar who was going to be spending a little time alone in prison  i guess dad finally came through for us he actually made a sacrifice  although who knows what hes up to  we should just stay away from him let him have a little time alone in prison  he is right about one thing though were brothers we shouldnt be fighting   we cannot afford to lose each other  i cant   i already lost a brother today  franklin  well i didnt lose him but hes all puckered and white  on the plus side you can take him to lunch at the club now  thats the kind of joke he would have loved  oh man     please dont do this   all right     on the next season of arrested development  i burned them on a cornballer  oscar robbed of his fingerprints has difficulty proving his identity  my hairs gonna grow back youll see  tobias and kitty go to vegas   only to find that his dream job has been filled  you found someone already  just came out of nowhere this guy  and the great thing is hes never out of character  and george sr turns out to be right about the effects of stress  whats happening to me why wont it grow back
