  gob was recently hired by the bluth companys rival  sitwell enterprises   although he started off well   fiftytwo percent of the country is single  thats a market thats been dominated by apartment rentals  lets take some of that market i call it single city   his ideas failed to evolve  its like hey you wanna go down to the whirlpool  yeah i dont have a husband i call it swing city  lets get into some new areas if you dont mind   but gob continued to finetune his first one  how do we filter out the teases  we dont let them in  this goes for the guys too  because sometimes the guys are tapped out  but check your lease man because youre livin in  city   youre fired  so get this  i took his dress eyebrows   sitwell suffered from a disease that rendered him completely hairless  hes not gonna be happy about that  no especially when he goes to the opera with two mustaches on his forehead  oh but the good news is im coming back to the bluth company     gob were gettin all jammed up here okay  the only reason that you were president was to appease the board  theyve been appeased i got the job  no i dont need to be president i just liked having an office a title   sure  paycheck  also i need a company car you do have to match sitwell there  hang on he gave you a company car  yeah and it was way better than any of the company cars dad ever gave me   yeah right  i mean the camaro was okay  are you serious dad gave you the camaro  i thought you won that on card sharks  michael i was never on card sharks dad told us not to tell you   michael decided to confront his father  whod been living in the attic since hed escaped from prison   dad  oh thank god youre here  im going crazy with the boredom michael  at least in prison we had knife fights and we had movie night  and once both those men did not enjoy soapdish i think you have to know that world  yeah listen did you buy a company car for everyone in the family except me  well according to the books i gave you four  im serious im driving a staircase for gods sake  it smells like gas i get hopons   well of course youre gonna get hopons  i pull down banners all right  and most importantly dad my son does not like to be seen in it  but he likes being seen with that girl   it makes no sense i know  it doesnt  i never gave you aa company car  no i gave you something far more important  i gave you company which apparently you dont want to give to me   youre not listening to me id love to sit and chat but  im lonely up here  ive got to get an early start im expecting headwinds on the stair car  you see anybody here you could bring me a book poppop gets a grisham  so you take your mom to work every day bummer  moms are such a pain in the ass huh its like die already   i love my mother  huh  shes one of the two most important people in my life  you know she and quincy   a spokesman for mr jones denies theyve ever met  although he could not explain the six signed gold records in starlas apartment  i could never be with a man who doesnt love his mother   oh  wow  so michael listen im here to convince you to hire me back  im an ideas man michael i think i proved that with  mountain  listen i want this michael  im gonna prove to you that im worthy of rehiring  if it takes every ounce of determination that ive got     where are you going  did you want me to stay and do that   barry  good news and even better news  your companys stock is unfrozen  and my lawsuit against the la kings is moving forward   how did that happen  maybe a puck hit me it could happen  no the stock now that means we can sell right we can do whatever we want with it  ill tell you one thing you dont want to do is buy stock in the la kings  do you think i could sell enough to buy a car  i thought you had four oh you mean a real one yeah sure  you can get one as long as everyone doesnt sell the company stock at once  you dont want someone else to get control of the company  right gotta keep the company intact right the other people shouldnt risk selling their  maybe you can draft up a letter to the investors  yes the stock is unfrozen we urge you not to sell   uh yeah whwhat you just said was perfect why do you want me to write it  just send it out on your stationery and do it quickly i have a car to buy   meanwhile maeby snuck upstairs to secretly read her scripts  ow back to film school   and george sr was only too happy to have something to read  armageddon il armageddon   thats a bad title    meanwhile michael went to get a good deal on a modest company car  oh something like this we have like 400 of these  l i dont need anything too popular  oh theyre not popular we have 400 of them  sold  although uh im wondering if maybe it should just be a little bit nicer  i got a kid and safetys kind of a factor but nothing too flashy  this is it isnt it i can tell youre excited   i am  ill draw up the papers  unless you think its too drab  and it gets very good mileage  yeah well it uh it looks light  you know im not so concerned about mileage  i spent the last 10 years on a bike with the exception of the stair car  oh youre the stair car guy you took down our banner  yeah sorry i got a hopon  i got distracted i hate this  i like these sunglasses they come with any car  just this one they throw these extras at you because its so impractical  no back seat it attracts so many tickets  the insurance alone costs as much as the last three cars we saw  the windbreaker windbreaker comes with it too  i guess i dont know ive never sold one of these before so  ill take it   michael hadjust indulged himself with an expensive sports car   and here again please  while buster indulged in a night out with tobias  this place is exactly what i had hoped for   all ladies  mmm  well ive heard that this uniform is the best way to meet    lucille 2  buster   so youre back  oh im back buster   yeah  and i am rock steady no more dizzies   lucille austero hadjust returned  from a monthlong stay at a facility that specialized in the treatment of vertigo  ah ah just a minute youre okay  youre okay youre okay were okay were okay  somebodyll be here in a second were okay were okay  i am stable as a table  so is there a a girl in your life   well i would hardly call my mother a girl  but yeah shes still very much a part of my life  no i mean uh someone who makes you hear music  oh well she mostly likes talk radio  i mean a girl who makes you feel romantic  and also who makes you hear beautiful music   oh no   i guess what im trying to say is    everybody thinks theyre frank sinatra   maybe we could start anew   and later michael got an urgent call from his mother  hes with her again busters taken up with that lucille 2  thats why you called me here  ive got my secretary bringing over a bunch of important papers   i thought this was urgent  well its all your fault  youre the one who insisted he get away from mother  well i wasnt trying to send him to a new one where is he   hes on the balcony    buster  moms becoming a little controlling  what tripped you off when she locked you out on the balcony again  that was half my fault i thought i saw a graham cracker out there    you baited the balcony  prove it  so i dont typically take sides with mother  but lli do agree that lucille 2  might not be the best choice for you  i wouldnt even have been there if mom wanted to go bowling  how am i gonna meet someone who has my interests   hi michael  hey great   i have those papers for you to sign  perfect  by the way i love your mother   oh yeah i do too  oh  i think i may have found a new girl for buster  good that lucille isnt really interested in buster anyway   shes just trying to get even with me  get even with you for what  she wanted me to let in her remodeling crew while she was out of town  wait a minute this tubs a little bigger than it used to be   it was instead ofletting the construction crew   into lucille austeros penthouse   come right in  lucille had put them to work on a project ofher own   whatd you do  well i sat on one of these jets   but i think we can fix it  dont give me that look  i moved the wall a couple of inches into her penthouse  dont think shes not over there right now plotting her revenge  god the new equilibrium really does  it makes the room seem tighter   shes always a step ahead of me  thats what makes her such a worthy opponent   howd you pay for it  i cashed in some stock you knew it was unfrozen  i know i sent you that letter it says not to sell or were gonna lose control  it does i stopped at unfrozen  lindsay you didnt cash in your stock did you tell me you didnt   i didnt   yet  theres a pretty long wait list for membership right now  gob you didnt sell did you  what no im trying to get a job from you mikey come on  okay as long as you two didnt sell i think we should be okay   i was afraid that l  i just bought the queen mary  youre kidding i was just gonna get a yacht  no no no the club i was dancing with what turned out to be the clubs owner  and he was looking to sell  oh he really really did look like a woman  but anyhoo can you believe that the only reason the club is going under  is because its in a terrifying neighborhood   this is unbelievable  tobias i promised that money to the country club   country club  its in such a good neighborhood  i dont believe this did you guys not read the letter   none of them had read past the word unfrozen  i hope youre all proud of yourselves  your careless selfish spending sprees may have cost us the bluth company  hey dad is that your new car in the driveway  i cant believe you got a corvette  its a company car   michael had bought a car  and it had helped put the company in jeopardy  im sorry about the patch im testifying against the kings this afternoon  you cant see it i just winked  so basically youre about 2000 shares short  of being the majority stockholders  now unfortunately its a private stock  so you cannotjust buy up the shares unless someone is willing to sell   are you sure  thats what they said on askjeeves   all right whos the majority shareholder now  a company called standpoor   standpoor  as in the opposite of sitwell  which is run by a certain hairless man  who could be very upset with you right now  what would he have to be upset with me about   youre wearing his eyebrows  they make me feel dressier     hello  is it true michael did we lose the company  kind of to something called standpoor yeah its sitwell   its lucille austero  lucille 2  standpoor because she cant stand up without falling over  i dont know why shed have any trouble a piano could stand on those legs  shes trying to get even with me for the remodeling  i think were gonna need a new floating thermometer  could i have your your blue cross number  well lets think about this mom i mean maybe theres a way that we can reason with her   give her buster  what   we need our company back  mom thats horrible  i dont suppose youve spent money on something you can return   sweet ride dude  lets give her buster  starla do you know where my brother is  yes hes on cloud nine that was me michael  whats going on wheres starla  oh shes saying goodbye to someone named q  if she can get past his security system shes gonna tell him its over  if she can get past his security system shes gonna tell him its over  shes amazing   we completely connected and its all because of you  you made this happen  i feel alive   indeed starla and buster did hit it off well   buster being a sweeter more supportive man than she was used to  and starla being a woman that wasnt 70  im just wondering if you didnt upgrade a little too fast  you know you want something sensible you end up getting pushed into something flashy   what does that mean  dont you think you belong in a lucille     maeby meanwhile gave reading her script another shot  only to discover her work was done  her scripts had been noted  so she went to find the person she thought was responsible  george michael i read your notes  what you oh you found the   well look i dontthat was a long  they were great  i mean they said so many things i wanted to say but i didnt know how you know  dont tell anyone okay  never  i guess she didnt see the drawings   meanwhile tobias prepared to assume ownership of the queen mary  no no its supposed to say tobiass queen mary  no that is not what it says i distinct hello  well i suppose i could just paint over mary  dont bother man this is our club now   tobias didnt want to sell his new club but lindsay did  which is why she hired several members of a local stripper agency  called the hot cops to pose as the roughnecks  all right fellas look i know you know nothing but a life on the street  but id like to offer you something that the queen mary gave me  the joy of the stage  so maybe you could uh start jeting  and stop jeterrorizing me    yeah  absolutely   we could do rent  well this is joyous news   and buster now convinced that lucille 2  was the right woman for him broke up with starla  you okay  it was for the best anyway  a girl like that deserves to be taken care of and im just a poor soldier  you didnt sell your stock  what no your letter said not to  and i would never want to hurt the family   and michael realized his little brother  deserved happiness more than anyone  you know uh i want you to forget about what i said  i was wrong you two belong together  ill take care of lucille 2 for you   really  yeah  let her down easy that right knee could go at any time  starla      and at the tobias is queen mary  tobias couldnt believe how quickly he had gotten through   to his ragtag gang of neighborhood toughs    wow you really have made some amazing strides in a half an hour  we have to take this to the streets  we have to strut   michael knew ifhe had any chance  of getting control of the company again   he would need to charm lucille 2  lucille 2   your hair  can i take you for a spin   but the spin in michaels new car retriggered her vertigo  that night tobiass plan to change the streets with his gang  also turned out to be illconceived  hey fezellaslooks like you guys are up to no good  well this gang used to be like that too three four  so you think youre tough well we hate rappin  but dont bust a cap in cause heres whats happenin  were breakinout some oldfashioned tappin       oh ive been shot   we miscalculated retreat  quick switch to follies   thats not gonna help     meanwhile michael and lucille 2 arrived to find the club nearly empty  although michael would have fit in perfectly  something its probably ill tell you what lucille   im gonna take you dancing huh  no michael please  you have undone all of dr sandor plumbs work  oh im sorry look the reason that i showed up tonight  was because i dont think that its right for you to be dating my brother  i mean hes met someone else and frankly  the only reason that he asked you out tonight  was because i wanted him to get the stock back from you  so that i could regain control of the company  but i would id rather have my brother back  so im sorry   i understand  thank you  and i do not blame you for not liking the bluths anymore  like the bluths i love the bluths   why did you buy up all of our company stock  to support you guys  i have always had a standing order to buy up any available bluth stock  you do know that were about 2000 shares short of controlling the company now   well you could have some of mine  really would you do that   yeah of course  well thatsthank you   actually there is a condition  anything   call me a cab  ah because of my driving yes   and so the next day  michael was thrilled to have control of the company back   i fixed everything  oh  with the business its all taken care of   you didnt think i could but i did  gob whatd you do   hi   gob had run into lucille 2 after michael dropped her off  my mom really took up a bunch of your space huh   what a bitch  what do you mean  when she expanded her bathroom and moved your wall over  thats why all your stuff s sticking out   oh   your mother really has a way of getting my goat     so gob  lucille 2   you what  oh and shes not gonna give the shares back now   you just said that you fixed everything  oh i meant my problems  yeah shes gonna make me the new president  you dont need to prove yourself to me little brother  you will always have a job here  but i do need the keys to the company car   on the next arrested development  lucille 2 reclaims some space  the queen mary changes hands once again  live wanted a small family restaurant since i got the kings settlement  it still has the dungeon area right   and gob gets needy   oh  lets go for it
