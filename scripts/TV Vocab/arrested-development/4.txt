that thing  well we sold the jet and they  didnt want this what am i gonna do  besides lindsay its not  like youre materialistic   well then its all yours  watch out for bridges and hopons  youre

this beloved tree  and refuses to come down  what is he protesting  the expansion of highcost  lowquality minimansions  like this one here   knocks on window glass shatters  you gotta be kidding me   michael met with his  sister about the activist in the tree   michael met with his  sister about the activist in the tree  you want me to get him out  oh come on its one tree  after we get that lot

replace the  stair car with a normal car  ill do it for the cats   meanwhile  martas interview was underway  and gob was getting  uncomfortable playing the supportive role  i just told him that we are this family now  and that careers one  thing but family is forever  i too have an announcement to make  to prove that no prison can hold me  i will incarcerate myself in the  penitentiary that holds my own father  only to escape 24 hours later  no shackles can hold these hands  say that to them in spanish   the next day michael  got a call to meet gob at the prison  youre going into prison i thought  there was something wrong with dad  what no dads fine just saw him in there  throwing the ball around with a couple guys  which of course he never did with me   how did you get them to agree  to this  oh  the wardens a fan  you really think you can break out of my prison  you wont even know i was here   the warden was  intrigued less about the stunt  and more about the prison beatings  this brash magician was sure to receive   well any press is good  press huh    right   so gob went about  swallowing the key to prepare for his escape   laughing  then i pass the key bust out  of prison and into magic history  of course that is gonna conflict  with my going to the desis with marta  well lifes a compromise  i probably would have taken her to the  nice event but prisonll be fun too   thank you i knew youd come  through   howd i come through   thank you i knew youd come  through   howd i come through  gob howd i come through  you might wanna find  something a little stronger warden    electric zap    groans what is your problem   meanwhile lindsay set  about fulfilling her promise to michael  get out of our  beeps tree   at this moment maeby  found another opportunity to rebel   we have to save this tree  we have to   and george sr was  about to be surprised by his son  keep your arm up thats how you get accuracy  thought you said throwing the ball  against the garage door by yourself  was how you got accuracy  gob what are you  doing here   life dad  i killed a guy  nah its just a publicity  stunt im gonna bust out tomorrow   impressive  no  you idiot  youre gonna

what youre doing for the environment  but were not the only ones who destroy trees  what about beavers  you call yourself an  environmentalist go club some beavers  you dont really get nature do ya  it will be torn down with or without you  where are the stairs   meanwhile the desis were underway   speaking spanish  guillermo ortiz como el ratn  pablo dominguez como pepito  felicio coln como miguelito  and lucille was mingling with the  elite of the latino television academy  can i get a vodka tonic please  id like a vodka tonic vodka tonic please  a sea of waiters and no  one will take a

im sure in his own way that hes  i just think he doesnt  understand family you know commitment  but those are the only things that matter in life   at that moment  michael realized that this was  the most beautiful woman hed ever seen  for the first time since he  lost his wife he wanted someone      laughs   at the same moment  gob was ready to retrieve the key  to execute his escape  is there a

with marta and didnt want the evening to end  while lindsay was bonding  with the man in the tree  you have no idea what its  like to save a living thing  well for your information i do  my husband tobias and i used to  do this kind of thing all the time  i guess thats why i was so attracted to him  he was a serious and  committed advocate for change  where is he now  at a weekend stage fighting

area by its points  and you dont let go no  matter what your mom says  mmm   good talk    hello   michael change of escape plan  i unplugged the ice cream sandwich machine  and the guards are all eating  them before they get too melty  so ive got like a half an hour  meet me at the south prison  wall and bring the stairs   michael knew he had  an obligation to his brother   whispering michael  hey gob  where the hell are the stairs  oh i thought you were kidding  hey speaking ofkidding how  serious are you about marta  i get the sense that theres not much of  a future there am i reading
