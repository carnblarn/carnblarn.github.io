 im glad sitwells coming over  let him see that were doing fine as a family  the only help we need is from each other   and apparently whatevers in that bottle  thanks for reminding me   my teamocil  wait a minute teamocil  isnt that that supplement that you and tobias were hocking before the fda shut you down   in the mid 90s tobias formed a folk band  to promote a supplement that promised better unity and teamwork    teamocil  teamocil may decrease your sex drive   teamocil  good job buddy  thanks friend  since ive been taking this again ive been getting along great with my husband  youre taking it for the side effect arent you   michael  oh god  mother not a good time im having a meeting here   look at what buster sent from the army  its blacked out  oh the government keep reading  sergeant blank is treating me very blank  and it looks like ill be shipping off to blank in about a blank   i blank you mother buster  ive done everything i can  i even tried to convince them hes gay but no one would believe  that a woman like me would have a gay son  well you certainly tried you guys wore matching outfits till he was 12   even once on a magazine cover  that had been mocked within the family for years  lucille lill say it again you never know whats going to happen in the army   remember lucille  no i dont   get me a vodka rocks  mom its breakfast   and a piece of toast  please stan sitwells coming over  that hairless freak is coming here none ofhis hair is real you know  you mean the guy were meeting with cant even grow his own hair come on  its called alopecia and id appreciate it if we could all be sensitive to it okay   he happens to be a very modest and generous man   modest and generous  then why is he always waving giant 10 million checks over his head   every time some  go ahead mom finish your thought  every time some childrens hospital needs funding  nonetheless we could get a giant checkbook too  were just not that starved for attention   and later sitwell laid out his plans   sorry that my son couldnt be here  let me guess girlfriend  you know it could be worse he could wanna marry your mother   oh im sorry is your family not laughing at that yet  okay let me tell you what im offering  you got a wonderful piece of property here thats going nowhere  so what i propose is a coventure with your sudden valley development  the first thing you might wanna change though is the name  you know sudden valley conjures up the image of a sinkhole no  i told that to dad i told that to my dad  im thinking paradise gardens     i swear to god i have that written  i want you to see so you dont think i have that written down in my notebook   when george sr was in charge  he had a habit of shooting down any idea michael came up with  and sudden valley just sort of implies that something awful could happen all of a sudden   plus its on a hill  what are you taking stupid pills come on  save us some money   this was a management tool that he used to keep michael   working for his approval  that was a hard one to say no to  the only thing i ask is out of the 450 homes we build  one be given to a disadvantaged family from the inner city  thats great so the other 449 families live in fear  is that what were saying i mean come on wheres your decen  what the hell just fell off your face   one of this guys eyebrows fell in the candy beans  i always carry a spare  well i hope you also carry a spare bowl of candy beans  gob im very impressed with the offer  im gonna run it upstairs see what kind of reaction it gets   hmm  so to speak    michael hoped to impress his father  i think it sounds pretty good  pretty good it was horrible what are you taking stupid pills again   but their old dynamic returned when george sr did  gob was the only one down there who knew how to handle that hairless freak   thank god we have gob on our team  you know dad  gob doesnt really do all that much for our team  in fact i think its time that i get put back in charge  michael listen to me lately your ideas theyre horrible  and sitwells just trying to figure out our batting order  for the softball game on saturday im telling you  gob said the same thing dad but li doubt that this guys  trying to drop 15 million to find out our batting order  hey this game goes way way back   it was a fierce rivalry with george sr using   everything at his disposal to win   no hair hey we got no hair  while stan sitwell used the game to raise funds for underprivileged children   oh i think one of your orphans is heading towards the street  strike three  you go down there and you tell him to go screw himself  and apologize to your brother  we need him on our side and we need him happy   wheres sitwell  sorry i told him to screw off   but get this he offered me a job  what  well im not waiting on my brother i pass   you look surprised  im sorry i mustve put it on too high  but you were right it was a bad offer and you were smart enough not to take it  you got gumption you speak your mind that means youre good enough to work for me   you  and i accepted hes waiting for me outside  were gonna swing by his wigmaker his just woke up hair is finally ready  youre really gonna do this  its ready mike theyre only gonna hold it for 24 hours   tobias and maeby meanwhile had mapped the route to the audition  well here we are and home we go  with plenty of time to get you to english class  wait you cant do a uturn on your dream  i say we get you on the lot and get the fnke name out there   start talking you up around the watercoolers  maeby well never get on here  i mean behind these walls are the biggest stars in the world  americas treasures   damn it  dad youre auditioning for the part of a confidence man  lets try a little confidence  you say confidence man hey im up for that part too   oh  good luck to you  good luck to you too   as tobias was gaining selfconfidence   michael was struggling to keep his  hi dad   wow youre president again  yes this is the way it should be  what do you think of when you hear the words sudden valley  salad dressing i think but for some reason i dont wanna eat it   right but paradise gardens  yeah okay i can see marinating a chicken in that  um im actually here about the softball game we need some girls on the team right  yes we do thats a league requirement   one that was difficult to meet given gobs behavior  in the third inning oflast years game  we could stay here wait for another popup   and in the fifth inning  come on yeah here we go   oh and before the game    we lost our entire outfield and a couple of court cases  well you know who would be great and not at all litigious is ann    mmm not ann  no  cause you know thisthis game is kind of our thing  but anns amazing you know she could play my position  you should be playing the field there in right you know  plus i got aunt lindsay playing this year i cant very well pull her off the roster  lets make ann the backup okay very good way to think about her as a backup   shes gonna be so excited  good   maybemaybe now ill get a kiss  okay  oh i meant from ann  yes i know i just want to get in there first   okay  lindsay wake up i need you to play on the softball team this year   lindsay felt the intended effect of teamocil    a sense of camaraderie  count me in michael happy to help the team   great news im back  you just left  yeah i dont think things are gonna work out with sitwell  i mean we picked up his sleepyhead wig everything was cool  next thing i know hes asking me for a bunch of work ideas  so i thought id just quit and go back to being president here  i need to do this job okay i need to prove that i can do this job   to who  to you  michael im your big brother ill never be impressed with you   still  anyway look you can still do it  i just want the office and my stuffs and title  what about if i help you with your work over at sitwell   youd do that  sure  you really want me to succeed at sitwell  well i just hey come on i really want you to be over at sitwell   lucille was worried that her son buster was being sent into battle with the army  i feel that weve not brought something up that might be a solution  um to spare my feelings  send you in his place i called they dont want you back   oscar had served in vietnam as a croc spotter on a swift boat  croc no sorry wait log  just a log no wait sorry croc     it was there that he met a young uso dancer named lucille   i prefer an older man    hey im free after the show  i said older bob not dead  i swore id never say his name again but  its time to call youknowwho   youknowwhowas an army sergeant named bill anderson  he and lucille were an item before she left him for oscar  at the studio tobias began to create buzz around the watercooler  that fnke is some kind of something  boy this fnke is all anybodys ever talking about  so sick and tired of hearing about how brilliant that fnke is  overrated ill just move im sorry  okay were okay okay  meanwhile maeby looked for an empty office to call george michael  where are you i bought you a day i cant put this book report off forever  sorry is this your office  no im just sitting behind someone elses desk pretending these are my kids  can you getjude law in here for a meeting   oh im just a reader  a reader   yeah  i need a report by tomorrow  before gymlunch with jim carrey  its the grinch guy youre too young  so get this sitwell loved my ideas  well my ideas and i knew it thats great   you know dad never complimented any of those  heres the thing   i need more  there were 34 proposals in there  youd be amazed how fast they come out when you read them all in a row  thirtyone bamboo floor upgrades cheaper stronger i cant read this word  thirtytwo wireless crapability that one explains itself   thirtythree  gob that was sixmonths worth of work   you cant just blurt them all out at once  mr bluth   hes coming ive got to go  you blew them away   bought you something maybe we can play catch sometime   gobs own father had only once played catch with him  and it ended as badly as any game of catch could end   white power  better yet maybe we can play ball on saturday  ill meet you there ive got a neck hair fitting at 1100   gob was both angry and overwhelmed  by the approval from this new father figure  it was confusing  michael was less torn and went to brag to his father  so apparently my ideas arent so bad and that comes from sitwell himself   you let your ideas go to sitwell  uh no i gave them to gob  who uh works there now  you let gob go to sitwell   whatd i tell you i told you  dont let him go i know   but my point is that i do all the work pop  he makes all the plays  dont you understand he was the best softball player in the league   gob was especially gifted at sacrificing his body for the play   plays at second plays at second  yeah suck on that sitwell  although at times even that wasnt enough  your tweety bird dance just cost us a run you moron   why do you think sitwell hired him  you cant do this youre gonna lose the game the company and you cant do this  what are you saying if i win the game youre comfortable with me running the company   thats what im saying  ill win the game  and ill show him that his little plan didnt work all right   we can build houses we can win games  that is what i wanna hear     we can win games  lindsay did that oven vent hit you your foot is bleeding   my foot is bleeding   teamocil may cause numbness of the extremities  youre gonna be able to play on our team right   why do you think im taking teamocil  to curb your sex drive  thats right what team are you talking about   it may also cause shortterm memory loss  okay looks like im gonna need that female backup player after all   and anns really good at softball huh  yeah shes amazing  you know shes got this low center of gravity you cant knock her over   well i could knock her over  dad im telling you you cant  they call her the wall you know  well thats great but i could knock her over i wont but i could    and lucille called on an old lover  william   yes maam  you dont remember me   general anderson had done three tours of duty in vietnam   but the only memory hed blocked was being left by lucille  oh god that touch   oh how could i forget pat  lucille  i could never forget that touch  bill theyre shipping my son buster off i cant have that happen   im sorry theres nothing i can do  is there anything i can do  maybe if you go downtown   oh i havent done that in 30 years   you make me want to puke bluth     and so buster was pulled out of combat training    put em down and halt  and put into uso training   it jolts but its not really doing it right now  and back at gobs new office   michael  do you still need those ideas  come on are you kidding me i cant let sitwell down   lim desperate here  then ill make you a deal   i want you to throw the softball game  never   he gave me this  course he did why do you think he hired you  he liked my ideas  they were my ideas and no he didnt  he wants you for the softball game because hes trying to make our family look foolish  i knew you had bad ideas all right well play him  ill throw that softball game  nobody makes a fool of our family without my help   tobias had talked up the name fnke and it was time to audition   whats your name  tobias  hes too short give it to the guard  oh l im not l on camera i seem much taller  and maeby picked up the readers report which had now become her book report   whatcha got there  i cant

film executive   its all waxed up  all waxed up what do you mean   i need something ajob for my dad  yeah yeah sure okay  listen to me brand new cars dont get waxed   that afternoon it was game time  and michael felt confident about a bluth win  spin spin spin   ann wasnt as amazing as george michael led his father to believe  but gob was playing worse than ever  as per his agreement with michael  your guy cant hit sitwell hes never gonna touch it   time out  time out  gob are you okay  yeah just cant hit today guess youre really disappointed in me  hey everybody has days like this its only a game  after that list of ideas you gave me i dont care if you blow the whole season  come here you  okay were good   and gob finally felt that someone believed in him  even though they werent his ideas  and he decided to make sitwell proud   get on that ball  you go  you better pull an ankle or something  come on george michael get that ball in there   then he went headfirst into the wall   im
