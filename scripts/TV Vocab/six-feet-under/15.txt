graduating from the plan tomorrow  and i would really like it if you would be my witness  the plan what is the plan  its a multidisciplined course that allows you  to think way beyond yourself  and rebuild your life from the ground floor  plank by plank  that sounds awful  it teaches you how to feel really good about yourself  and get what you want out of life  do you want to go  it would really mean a lot to me ruth   wow  pretty sweet huh  each portal is lit by recessed halogens  tasteful signs for the model name materials and pricing  and this little drawer here  this displays your interior upholstery fabric  point of purchase does not get any better than this my friends  its very impressive  impressive its fucking gorgeous  its a completely interactive retail experience  cause human beings  were tactile  we like to touch the fruit before we buy  i cant believe you guys youre still using a catalogue  now these caskets here  therere on the upper level  they appeal to men its at their average height  down below are the ladies favorites  i have seen the future and this is it  dave where would it go  we put it in the second viewing room  what the room that weve been using for storage  david that room needs serious work  so we use this as a reason to do it havent we been  planning to do that with the money mom gave us anyway  dave that money is almost all gone  a two by five like this will not break your back  ill tell you what  that includes installation ill even throw in a fresh coat of paint for your room  you cannot beat that with a stick  nate you always say we need  to spend money to make money  alright how long to install  give me the word and youll be making sales in two days   you really like it  who wouldnt  ive never seen david happier it was like christmas morning when we were kids  whoa working out a little aggression there  were having chicken piccatta it needs to marinate over night  you never cook like this for me you never even cook  and when trevor goes back to new haven i need you to forget that i can  alright what should i wear  speedo hair extensions wear what you want i dont care  dont wear one of your funeral suits  oh i thought you dont care  wear something that makes you look like the sexy bad boy you really are  something that makes mister wife and kids   question all of his middleclass choices  im all for that just as long as you wear something lowcut in the back  so he can see my name branded on your ass  hello hello  hello  hello  hey new casket wall huh  you boys are doing better than i thought  im mitzi dalton huntley  david fisher  do you need to plan a funeral  you have no idea who i am do you  im southwest regional director  for kroehner services international  i was hoping that maybe you and your brother  might share a cup of coffee with me  well hello mitzi dalton huntley  nate fisher  youre a runner huh  its bad for your knees  yeah well everythings bad for something  so i hear  why are you here  i made it abundantly clear to matt gilardi  were not interested in selling  oh matt gilardi is no longer with kroehner  yup i fired his worthless ass  because i didnt like the way  that he was representing our company  and that is why im here today  to do a little damage control  and apologize to you boys  right  oh i dont blame you for not trusting me  frankly id be worried about you if you did   cream with three sugars  well thank you  you didnt put rat poison in here did you  drink it and find out  oh please  you boys arent afraid of big bad mitzi  are you  come on  the economy is in a tail spin  corporations are downsizing and resizing  and reorganizing  including kroehner  we cant afford to take you over honey weve got problems of our own  okay lets just cut the foreplay  but thats the best part  its not that we dont trust you  we despise everything you stand for  corporate profits over personal service  stockholders over clients  greed over everything else  so i think you should take  your gesture of good faith  and shove it up your ass  ooh well thats one opinion  anything that you would care to add david  no i think nate pretty much summed our position up  well alrighty then  ill just show myself out  by the way you might want to clean out your coffeemaker  your coffee sucks  this is not so good  well who the fuck is named mitzi anyway that sounds like something you name a fuckin chiuaua  pretty bitchin huh  when did you start getting all excited over caskets  youre turning into david  dont ever say that again  very nice  oh welcome to casketeria may i take your order  so mr langmead is all ready to go  great  yeah so nate have you guys had a chance to think about what weyou know   uh yeah  yeah   yeah lets go in the office  okay  so do these really open can you like hide shit in here  can you close the door  close the door doesnt sound too good  we cant give you a loan right now rico  look we just spent a fortune on the new casket wall  and now we have to maintain an emergency fund  in case kroehner starts acting up again which suddenly looks very likely  it was a tough choice im sorry  how much did that casket wall cost  rico our first priority is  keeping this house open  the more income we make the more you can make  tell me one thing did you and david decide to buy that wall before or after we spoke  wow you know first you

cannot design a life that works without first drafting a clear blueprint  and you cannot construct a life that has meaning without first laying a solid foundation  you are the architect of your life  not your emotionally distant father  not your overly critical mother  not your petty fairweather friends  you   it was hard the first time i stood up for myself  i always wanted everybody to like me  even though i hated myself you had to like me  when i rebuilt my foundation  and i was able to honor and elevate the better part of me  i realized i really like me  so you dont have to  im not a salvage job  i am not a teardown i am not junk  its taken me many years to say that to believe it  there are days that i slip and i treat people like shit  like i treated myself for the last 30 years  but then i swear im going to win this  im going to build the life that i always wanted to live  i thought it was too late  two terrible marriages  children who wont even return my phone calls  it hurts  im 41 and i feel like im 80  but i have value  im still here  and as long as i believe in myself  and speak fiercely from the eye  then theres still hope  theres no mortgage on my life  i own
