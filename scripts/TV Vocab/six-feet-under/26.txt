then well start with your billing records  its that door directly across  i thought kroehner folded  this must be the final mindfuck of mitzi dalton huntley  claire fisher  can i start again  fuck  claire  claire  so i had this idea we should put a pool in the backyard  careful of the puddle  thats nasty  a little kidneyshaped pool we can dip in the summer its not even that expensive  were paying back your sister  she doesnt need to be paid back she doesnt even want it  you only dont want to be paid back when you want to have something over someone  do you know much shes getting paid to play that slutty neighbor on the wb   wheres my hot sauce  its on there  i dont see why we cant get one thing nice for ourselves  dont talk about the money in front of him  get rid of the food  i hope i didnt interrupt your lunch  im sure they werent eating  this is our embalmers wife she was just stopping by  does she have a license to be down here  shouldnt mr buchbinder be in the refrigerator  im just about to take him to the crematorium  really  it looks to me like youve got yourself a novacancy situation at the fridge motel  hes not even staying here  id love to let this slide  but since mr buchbinder paid for two days refrigeration in his preneed contract  im going to have to write you up for a consumer disclosure citation  and we are kneedeep in human waste  why did your grades take such a plunge in the spring  i dont know i guess i sort of stopped relating to high school  did something happen last year  well bad boyfriend  okay  thats it unless you have any questions or anything else youd like us to know  well good luck claire it was nice to meet you  also not that this is whatever  but my father died last year  im sorry  i dont think it had anything to do with getting bad grades but maybe it did a little  it would if it were me thank you for letting me know  you know im not like oh poor me or anything  you know i just thought of this  but before that happened  i always liked to make stuff for people like presents or whatever  and then when my dad died i couldnt  i dont even know how to talk about it i mean even now you know  but then i started to make stuff that was sort of about that at first  you know and then stuff that was about other things too  and im sorry that im rambling now  but i guess i just wanted you to know that i feel like i have this  way now of like dealing  and its so much better  im sorry excuse me  excuse me im sorry this is so queer  its fine i constantly cry at inappropriate moments  yeah but i really dont  here sweetie  thank you  thanks  well have your ashes on saturday  he actually asked that i be here for it to start the machine  cant do it today  a pacemaker exploded in the retort so theyre fixing the burners  come back tomorrow afternoon well torch him then  is taylor in her room i got her an air purifier thats also a humidifier  taylor  wheres all her stuff  my parents came today to take her down to san diego   for how long  for good  why  theres no way we couldve kept her not after what i did  we could have tried   you could have told me  i got suspended today  oh my god until when  it doesnt matter im not going back there   you dont know how youll feel  dont tell me what i know  you know its summer  maybe its cause when i was growing up there were seasons  but it still gives me this charge and its not just the nipples  its that the whole worlds out there feeling sexy in their skin  i cant sit with a beer in my hand and watch the ass parade anymore  because it takes me out of my fing reality  its a drug  that little shine of sweat  some chick in traffic  i just want to jump in that car and lick it right off of her  on my wife it makes me sick  i can see the stains under her arms  the red bumps where she shaves all the fing details  but thanks to my higher power and this program  i havent crossed my bottom line in three years  and for me that means no sex outside my marriage  no prostitutes no strip clubs no masturbation  and it also seems to mean no sex in my marriage  i stopped doing all the other stuff  because i wanted to learn how to be more intimate with my wife  and i have  i love her  i love her more than anything  i just cant touch her  i couldnt even kiss her any more than i could kiss my own mother  the fact is i have this fing disease and this is how its showing up today  so thanks three years right  you really have to love someone to have their face burned into your flesh  or just be really drunk  the lowest i could get was 38  thousand the lowest  they have to dig up the whole foundation of the house to replace those pipes  we can try another contractor   fuck  what is this  were going to have to shut down the home for a while   what  this inspection just totally fucked us  the maximum fine is 2500 at a time  weve two weeks to fix the drainage system we dont have the money  and kroehner cant even buy us out anymore  so what does this mean  we hope youll consider taking something temporary  so when we work things out you can come back  you mean if you work things out  we know its a lot to ask  scott  candace bouvard  i am so sorry candace i had sex with like 200 women last year  and all the faces are a blur  why are you only taking   thats what you prescribed  but youre still having seizures  you were supposed to tell me so i could adjust the dosage   well you didnt tell me that  im sure i did  now theres a bleed this was so unnecessary  whats a bleed  thats blood  the avm ruptured probably during your last seizure   wouldnt i have felt that  apparently not  if id done the embolization last summer we wouldnt be in this situation  avm is very treatable if you treat it  wait a minute you didnt   okay i want to do it now  so would i if i were you  but at this point my only option is immediate cranial surgery  what does that mean  it means it looks like this sucker is bordering an eloquent area in the brain   well you said it wasnt last time  you must have misheard me  its a lot of information  what does that mean  im not gonna lie to you theres a high risk of paralysis  ioss of speech vegetation or death  but i have a very strong record with this kind of surgery   how many deaths  not many  i cant fit this in tomorrow im gonna have to come in saturday for this  but i need your blood work done today  connie will tell you where to go for that when you check out  i really dont like the idea that im sick  nobody does  come on its a little selfindulgent dont you think  when there are people dying of leukemia or whatever  these guys are like  its not my fault i blew 25 guys last night i have a disease i mean deal with it  when i tried to deal with it i ended up with a sexual harassment lawsuit  filed against me by half the female associates in my firm  fuck  im really glad we didnt you and i  i was spreading gonorrhea all over la last summer  so when did you admit you were powerless   i havent yet by the way  i can tell  five months two weeks and three days ago  and now your life is just one long hot fuck with god   im an atheist actually  yeah  and who do you turn over your will and your life to  i just pray to nothing  i say dear god who i dont believe in help me  with whatever it is  to stop thinking about  undressing this incredibly sexy woman who i am trying to have a real moment with  or something like that  does it work  unfortunately yeah it does  well im not gonna stop drinking or smoking pot  all you can do is just take it one day at a time  all those fucking slogans make me want to tear off my clothes  and run screaming out of the room  you know im curious  how does having compulsive sex with strangers  no close relationship with friends or family  a job that you hate and a broken engagement  feel manageable to you  i didnt say that my life wasnt unmanageable  i just said that i hadnt admitted that i was powerless  i dont want to hate my parents any more than i already do   youll probably end up forgiving them  well i dont want to do that either  i dont want to be one of those people that walks around in pain all the time  what about when you are in pain  i choose not to be  whats so bad about a little pain  i feel like itll kill me  it wont  i cant believe that guy blew up in the retort  we usually check for the pacemaker but this guy was like 20  go ahead  and built he looked like he worked out five hours a day  vanity these guys are out there taking pills getting implants  men are the new women   yeah no kidding  i hate gyms  all those people on machines staring at the tvs  they looks like pod people training to live among the humans  shit  hang on i got to reposition him  ive got to make sure the chest is right under the main burner  thats where most of your mass and fluids are  all that stuff that really fuels the burn  we used to leave it chunky so people would know it was real cremains  not just wood chips like that place in georgia  but then we did this baby  and the dad saw a little tooth and he freaked like this isnt my baby  we had to get a doctor to explain to him that they have teeth embedded in their jaws  man he was upset  but you know when a baby goes its a lot of dead hope  you going to lisas   i have every right to see my granddaughter  im coming with you  did you talk to her  youve got a key  sometimes i stay with the baby when lisa has to work  they should be here soon  see i told you  granny was gonna be here  hi granny  hello sweet pea  carole made me come with her to this intuitive nutritionist  who told her shes allergic to everything  she squeezed caroles fingers for 10 minutes  and i had to spend two hours looking for burdock root  i think erewhon has burdock  thanks  im sorry to show up like this i wont stay long  im really happy youre here  you know who this is  this is your daddy  this is where you get your little mouth from  hi  hi maya  i know youre thinking maya is illusion in buddhism  but its also another name for durga the mother in sanskrit  and in greek its messenger of the gods  and my mother was halfgreek so you know  my gosh shes so small  mom come on  youll thank me when youre old  ill get it  hi barbara how are you  im fine did you get the tape  shes just as precious as precious can be  hold on lisa its barb  tell her ill call her back  whos barb  my sister  caroles movie  no i just dont enjoy films about retarded people  but lisa went to the premiere  she said it was great  sorry about my mom i guess shes been a little ionely  shes a godsend shes been such a help to me  she looked wonderful  we altered a purple chiffon caftan i had in the closet from the 70s  shes just so loving and fun  i just hope i can be half as good a mother as she is  im sure you can  okay bye now   ruth is this the blanket  thats the one i made for nate  i love it  in certain ways lisa really reminds me of myself  something about the way you two are together  reminds me of your father and me  i was raised with a very smalltown mentality  and getting married was really the only way you could have sex at all  so i never tried to find the perfect someone you know  but that doesnt matter when there are children  it becomes its own very real kind of love   mom im not marrying lisa  did i say you should  i think you should consider the profound effect a child can have on your life  mom you should find some place and pull over for a minute   why are you all right dear  no im not  saturday  i kind of need to do it as soon as possible  have you told david  yeah  would you like me to tell claire  she knows  she saw me have a seizure so i had to tell her  im sorry mom  ill go to the hospital with nate  david will take robbies video camera to claires graduation  so we can all watch it later   mom  its fine i already asked him  and hes bringing it over later to show you how it works  were not going to my lameass graduation when nate is having major surgery  claire nate is going to be just fine  there is no reason for this procedure to ruin your special day  its not even special im just going for you  it is special its a rite of passage  im not going to let you get overshadowed by your brothers like you always do  if claire doesnt care about this id like to be with nate too  david god damn it i am the mother here  and i am a good one no matter what you think from your limited point of view  this is what we are doing  now who wants milk  so now you can get them to make you a partner  its fisher  sons remember  its not fisher  sons  diaz  that was before you had 100000 they need  i want to put it in a mutual fund or something  some okay but nothings worth as much as being your own boss  julio check the bath isnt running over  i dont know  the business isnt even going so great  so you go in there you make it go great  he didnt do it  julio turn off the bath  ill do it  no he needs to learn to do something when i tell him  youll let the whole house get flooded so you can teach him something  thank you  i want to be cremated i dont want to be embalmed no viewing  this is very difficult for me  do you want me to fill it out by myself  yes   i dont think we should do this now  we have to all right  i dont want you to have to deal with the funeral  youre not going to die  i have to get ready for it  and i think you should too   what about a service  yeah  i want ari  the rabbi who did jeffrey shapiro  a rabbi why not father jack  is father jack doing your service  no but thats just because i dont want to give him the wrong idea  what kind of idea is he going to get when youre dead  i dont know i just dont want him cruising me in the afterlife  oh god im sorry  what do you think the afterlife is some sex club that never closes  yeah and no one ever tells you if its heaven or hell  fuck i am really scared  me too  i wish you could come with me  okay im not going to claires graduation mom is insane  no go to the graduation thats not what i meant  oh god  youre home early  where were you  just getting something to eat  i was going to make dinner  you can still make dinner  you mean for myself  whatever i might be kind of hungry later  you sure you want to eat that  i was going to make a poached chilean sea bass and polenta  with a wild mushroom cassoulet  you couldve gotten me something  i didnt know youd be home  did you do anything today  whats that supposed to mean  did you call that guy  i dont need to pay to learn i can get a job in security  im sure therere options you dont know about  i know a lot of excops they all work in security  whats wrong with security its a national obsession  its the new freedom  you know what my career isnt your problem  i have new pictures of maya  yes i have seen  the new ones i dont think so  is very cute i have seen  you havent seen these the smiling ones i just got these yesterday  ruth is not my grandbaby i dont need every day to see  i quit consider this my twoweek notice  because i dont looking at your photos  no im not growing in this environment  and i want to be available to help watch my granddaughter  and since i dont have the money to help pay for a sitter its the least i can do  you take other job  eventually i suppose ill have to under the circumstances  okay then ruth is also better for me  this way only have to pay robbie  well yes  and also you should know you may be losing fisher  sons as a client  we may close the business because theres no money to replace the septic system  this is my fault is that what youre saying  no i just thought you should know you might be losing the account   i will pay you back this money  i said it was a gift  even though you said it was gift i will pay back  well thats very sweet but we both know thats not possible  here every week i pay some part of it  here this is the first payment  62  it was a very slow week  i did knock  im sorry was that too loud  i just thought id stop by say hi  okay  i thought you were going to that art school  i so blew the interview  theres no way  i totally started bawling  what do you mean why  i started talking about dad for some like insane reason  and i just fucking lost it  so is this operation really serious  nah i just gotta you know get rid of this thing  its so not a big deal  well good  because  just good  okay that was before you talked to me so  did you take these these are amazing  well theyre okay  this guys a total fucking freak  but the pictures are awesome  thanks  i thought you were going to yell at me  i didnt yell i was just looking out for you  okay dont take this the wrong way  and i know  i have a tendency to fall for kind of insane boys  but you have a tendency  to dole out the wisdom like youre the dalai lama or whatever  and its not like youre incredibly together that im just dying for your advice  i never said i was incredibly together im just a lot older  yeah and i dont think youre that much better than i am  at the relationship thing like at all  well i disagree  no one i dated ever attacked anybody with a knife or a gun  okay  and i dont know what goes on between you and lisa or brenda  or the other million missing girlfriends  there have not been a million  i just get the sense that youre not fully dealing  all right   fine ill never give you advice again  no give me advice  just dont try and act like you really know anything   wait is he nude  no  god  50000  do you have any idea how much this business is worth  not much when its shut down  and i want to be equal partner   rico you  wait  im sorry i have to say this now but i think you might want another partner  not equal no way  75000 for 25  done  all right okay  so i just wanted to tell you that i think a lot of what you had to say   im so sorry  just let me finish  a lot of what you said was true  i didnt have the right to say anything to you  im the one thats fucked up  i am so fucked up  okay  maybe  but you were right when you said that  being with you made it easier for me to feel so together  that i was ready for something real and you werent  and that is just not really true  nate i have a serious problem  i think im  god i so dont want to say this  here  ive been going to these meetings  i went to one of these meetings once up in seattle it freaked me out   why  just the people it seemed like a cult  no what made you go  i thought it might apply  well it says in the book that once you realize what it is  and you work really hard you can  people have this whole new experience of love  some people i mean  so what  i really love you  and i dont think i would have done what i did if i didnt really love you  thats a very strange thing to say  but i think its true  it was the fear of  feeling something  real  okay  i love you too  i just wanted you to know that even though you really pissed me off  i still get so angry if i let myself think about it  of course you do  but i felt like this was something  being with you made me feel more  just feel more i guess  more than i used to feel more than i felt with anyone  everything i was running away from i dont even know what it is  fear i guess  i felt all of that with you  im good at making people feel fear  but i cant   im not saying now  i cant even think about the future  im just saying maybe  im having surgery tomorrow  its an embolization totally routine  can i be with you  no  my moms coming with me  and its really nothing i mean im gonna be fine  nate   look im sorry i got to go  nate please  you know ive been thinking  it really could be good for you guys to have a latino point of view at the home  too bad it comes in the form of a controlling homophobe  when we met you were a controlling homophobe  and apparently that was very attractive to you  will you come with me to claires graduation tomorrow   id really rather not  why not  its not a good time for me to be dealing with your family  its not my family its me and claire my mothers going to be with nate   i really cant  youd miss the young and the restless  god keith i ask you for one thing  what do you think we are roommates its like i dont even exist  in case you havent noticed i have a lot to deal with right now  not noticed it defines my entire life everything is about taking care of you  for once which you cant deal with because youre the one who always needs it  that is such bullshit who were you taking care of  when you sent taylor away without telling me what am i the dog  i made a decision and it was mine to make   why was it your decision  its my family   i thought i was your family  well youre not  yet  david youre not  you just moved in and now theres this pressure to be  whatever family unit fantasy you had in your head  when you got engaged to jennifer  i care about taylor she feels as close to me as  thats not the point its not always about what you want  you are such an asshole  i have been tiptoeing   tiptoeing  get off of me  lying on the couch crying about this and pretending everythings fine  i was crying about my brother you selfish fuck  my brother could die tomorrow do you even think about how i feel   not if you dont tell me  you could notice  you could give a fuck for once in your life about somebody besides yourself  im really gonna miss high school  so why does monty pappas think  getting into williams has made him into someone anyone would ever fuck  as if the name of the college matters at all  i dont even know where williams is virginia  vermont  it has that summer theatre program where movie stars go to have sex and do chekhov   oh my god how did your interview go  it severely sucked   are you suicidal  no  east valley will be fine  theyve got a darkroom theyve got paint  and everyone says you get out of college what you put into it anyway so  whatever  im glad youre so delirious about it because it looks like im going there too  what do you mean  yale found out about my sats that little indian bitch turned herself in  hundreds of people are screwed just so she wont come back as a rodent  okay it isnt that funny  cunt  oh god  you ready to go mom   is it time already  yeah just about   but you havent even eaten  im not supposed to  of course im such an idiot  no youre not  clearly theres something wrong with me  that made you keep this from me while your brother and sister knew   mom im sorry  but why why does this keep happening  i just didnt want to worry you  youre not supposed to protect me im supposed to protect you  but you cant   you cant protect me from this  but i can try thats what a mother does  she tries to protect you and most of the time she fails  but its the trying that makes you feel loved  how will you feel loved if you dont ever let me try  i do  i do feel loved  it was just so many months i could have loved you better  you loved me fine  youre everything  you dont even know youre everything to me  god i dont want to go  i wont go i cant i cant do this i cant  i dont want to go   i wont let you go  i dont wanna go  ill never let you go  almost ready  we caught up with las hottest high school graduate  in a quiet moment at home  so claire how does it feel to be leaving your childhood behind  all right you can really stop that now  for many young people graduation brings up feelings of anxiety and pissiness  no really cut   are you smoking pot  you want some  yeah  god these dust balls are like tumbleweeds  when was the last time anyone swept under here  i dont know when did mom start working for nikolai  your mother is a very good woman  god have mercy  how psyched are we that we never have to call him daddy  thank god she snapped out of it  i think hes the one who pulled the plug actually  really what a pig he thinks he can do better than mom  im guessing she was a little clingy  did nate ever tell you what happened with brenda  no he was strangely nonverbal about it  hes usually so eager to regale us with the details of his personal life  not always  i guess not   so when did they go  really early  i guess its like a twopart thing  yeah first they try to stop the bleeding with glue  they put a catheter in through his groin and thread it up  its okay i dont need the details  sorry  that part must have happened already the cranial surgery is a few hours later  so like now  soon i guess  theres no way were going to this stupid graduation   i know fuck it  seriously   youre driving  fine  youre just going to feel a slight sting okay  count back from 10 please  ten nine eight  seven six
