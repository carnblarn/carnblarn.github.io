away  i see victors a veteran if you like we can research benefits he might be due  no vic hated the army me and him been fighting the army for seven years  his unit cleaned up a place called bunker 73 in the iraqi desert  chemicals all over saddams stuff we blew up  as soon as he came back he got sick  lung cancer at the age of 29 never smoked a day in his life  still no one will say the words gulf war syndrome  he just wasted away in and out of that hospital  so fuck the army let them keep their fucking money  i gotta fly up to idaho falls to tell my stepfather  hes got alzheimers i dont know if hell hear me or not  youre absolutely sure you wouldnt like the opportunity  to say goodbye to victor before  i already said goodbye  just do it  and as for a receptacle for his cremains  a paper sack ought to do just fine  nine hundred bucks  well he obviously doesnt know about the poseidon society  or thats 900 wed be out of  that guy was the shit when i was in high school  you know i never knew he had a brother  its time you introduced yourself hes at the va hospital  first i just gotta talk to you about something  its out of the question i cannot spare you we have three bodies

in chicago  the critic of the suntimes called him the father of the new rustic cuisine  and then he gave it all up to become a hairdresser  and he has never been happier  youre multiplying differing variables so you have to simplify  okay and then finally oops look at that  same variable okay four and four gives us what  eight and finally these two binomials  right here are exactly the same  so we what  combine  two x to the third y to the fourth  okay  any questions  claire fisher  what  can you explain this formula to the class  not really  maybe if you paid attention instead of reading  maybe if you talked about something that was gonna be useful to me i would  oh algebra is useless  i know a lot of physicists whod beg to differ  well i dont want to be a physicist  algebra forces your mind to solve problems logically   its one of the only perfect sciences  you think the world runs on logic   come on open your eyes  ill see you after class miss fisher  what are you doing  all right now lets try another one and im gonna make this a little tougher  okay x to the a power times y to the b power  okay now weve got two  of course we have catalogs for wedding package  but you have to come in and look i cant show you over the phone  website what website we dont have website  mister you have to come into my shop and look at my work  website   the day just gets brighter  hush  so whos dead now and what do you need  nobodys dead i came to return these vases  you should recycle them save a little money  so thoughtful i am touched  dont be silly its wasteful thats all  here   you still have that sign in the window  yes you know somebody good   i do me  you  i am interested lets talk robbie i going to lunch  im not going to lunch with you nikolai im seeing someone   so what this is business  i hope so   because otherwise i withdraw my offer  tell me why i should hire you  ive been working with people for  i respect people too  youre pompous and arrogant and youre full of yourself   you act like the customer needs you  of course the customer needs me   i have what he wants  youll never build a business that way  im better with people and i know about flowers  if you dont think so you can fire me  fire you how i can fire you you dont even work yet  my parish in new mexico i think they were afraid of me   they recommend you highly  they always do after im gone  i wont lie to you david ill push for some change at st barts  this is one of those congregations that thinks sitting through church  absolves them of moral responsibility and they can ignore the plight of others  dont get me wrong theyre good people  theyre just lazy  i dont think thats entirely fair clark we have a homeless outreach  you know youre the swing vote  ive been a deacon three weeks im still getting used to how political this is  religion is politics david  jesus was a revolutionary  he threatened those in power and they had him assassinated  theyd do the same thing to him today  im not sure how much luck youll have getting st barts to stage a coup  the last thing that god wants from us is complacency   you should be in the peace corps  already done it  three years in nicaragua fresh out of divinity school  thats where i lost my wife  im sorry  the hardest part about my work is the fact  that most people dont want a real relationship with god  sure theyll pray to a man nailed to a cross  but theyll ignore the gay kid who gets strung up  or the black man who gets dragged behind a car  or someones mother living in a box  were you this forthcoming with the other deacons  hardly  what did you and walter kriegenthaler talk about  golf  so why did you decide to be so honest with me  because i can tell that right and wrong actually matter to you  fuck  this is medieval we gotta get it fixed before somebody loses a finger  you never cared until it was your finger   rico a little help  why should i  you know its because of you im gonna work double shifts this weekend  thats just david being dramatic  wed have to get at least two new bodies for that to be necessary  they come in bigger numbers than that  just forget it i know the score  its never gonna be fisher  sons  diaz i know that   lets see what we got  this ones a cremation   nothing for you  oh fuck what is that  shouldnt just burn people like theyre garbage  what the  look it came with fries  look at this  doesnt even look like the same guy does it  this says he applied to be buried at the national cemetery  he signed requests for a flag fold military escort  oh man  then you cant burn him  i can make him look like that again  well almost  you could ace algebra claire and we both know it  power rests on the kind of knowledge one holds  whats the use of knowing something useless   dont quote castaneda at me  why not you quote bob dylan at me   you need algebra for college  youre assuming im going to college  youre taking the psat tomorrow that means youre thinking about it  is that the only option go to college get a job be a good consumer  until you drop dead of exhaustion i dont want that  so what do you want  i just want something to matter  maybe i should wander around the desert and eat peyote and see god  yeah be a homeless drug addict  youd get bored with that pretty fast  hey have you heard of the sierra crossroads program  whats that like bungee jumping for jesus  no no its not affiliated with any religion its actually a great program  i spent a couple of years there as an instructor   i think you might really like it  why  because it would get you out of yourself get you out of your head  now ill warn you its hard but exhilarating  it might give you the challenge youre looking for  theres an expedition over spring break  i could pull some strings see if i could get you in   why do you care what happens to me  because i like you  and i want to see good things happen for you and i know they can  we had to dig his service records out of st louis  then theres the question of whether his cancer was service related  that means finding a doctor who thinks it was  it took me four months to get all the approvals  but it means a burial allowance of up to 1500 from the va  might as well take that stuff too i packed it up for him  thats too bad nobody told his brother what he wanted  i did  oh yeah i gave paul the forms i found them later in the trash  its mostly somebody elses writing on the forms  it doesnt match victors signature at all  i filled them out for him  he tried to do it himself but those boxes are pretty small  and he shook a lot  gulf war victory parade  victor said marching in it was the proudest moment of his life  why would he keep it and watch it over and over if he hated the army   did paul visit him much  yeah three or four times a week  he was really good about it   so how come he  he couldnt  paul would say the fucking army stole your life vic  and vic would keep his mouth shut  i can tell you this  victor wanted to believe that what he did in the gulf meant something  that his life was not a waste  i only counsel im not supposed to interfere with what the family wants  so you taped his medals to him fished his files out and passed them to me  well you can always blow it off  i mean you didnt even know the guy right  what are you doing  there was a form that said hes getting a military funeral   who authorized this nate  yeah  how many times have i told you  when nate gives you instructions check with me  turn him off  ill drive him to the crematorium right now  do i have to do it myself  fucking nate paul kovitch is who our contract is with  and if he finds out about this he will either sue us or break our legs   tomatoes right there  okay   look whos here  hello mrs fisher  hello dear   hello im brenda  hiram gunderson  i understand you like to camp  why yes i do  i wish i could tell you where nate is but i have no idea  its okay i can exist without him   toasted sesame seeds

traffic   hi im nate  hiram ive heard a lot about you  well dont believe a word of it  hey im sorry  dont be im having fun   so what did i miss  i want to go to sierra crossroads  well talk about it later claire  mom you should let her go crossroads is great   you went  yeah  we went kayaking down the colorado river the summer i was what 17   i dont think you were even born yet  i dont remember

need you to pick him up tomorrow  oh fuck david he wanted a military funeral he filled out the forms  is he paying our bill  you were with his brother it was clear he did not want the body embalmed  he could sue us and we wouldnt have a case  okay you know what  when you talk to me like this it makes me want to not listen to you  you and i could lose everything mom could lose her home  vic is eligible for a bigger allowance from the va than we thought  really   im leaving  ill walk you down   bye david  bye  why dont you come over spend the night  ive gotta be in pasadena tomorrow it would

people  you know what occurred to me tonight thats really strange  i wish youd known my husband  i think the two of you wouldve liked each other  oh ruth  who would get me a gift basket  its probably some hollywood bigwig that secretly wants to sleep with you  its from my brother and it is addressed to both of us  sorry about this morning have fun at cactus world  who knows  this is nice we can take it with us this weekend  i cannot wait to get out of here im in dire need of some serious relaxation   oh fabulous  smoked oysters  really is there any caviar  no but there are condoms   and okay

to ask you  whats up with those matching tattoos you and he have  we were in vegas we were very drunk and  oh dear  these things always struck me as kind of ridiculous  would you just stop that  what does he think were gonna do with this this is like hostile  look billys bipolar hes medicated  his sense of whats appropriate can be a little off at times  look you have no idea what hes been through  dont judge him please  all right  all right  thank you  youre never gonna get out of this one  i was nowhere near the latrine sir i promise   give it up private your ass is busted  yeah youre in big trouble  but my fathers on the joint chiefs of staff  well maybe we can t courtmartial you but there is something else we can do  yeah come on private yeah  you love that don t you   hello  david walter kriegenthaler   did you meet with father clark  yes today  wed like to meet at 930 tomorrow and vote   can you make it  absolutely  let me ask you a question david  do you think clark is gay  i dont think so he mentioned something about having a deceased wife  i mean i don t care if he is i just don t want him to push that agenda  you know marriage that whole thing  i have a cousin in dc whose church split because of that  literally half the congregation left  i don t want that to happen to st barts ive been going there for 40 years  well its late ill see you tomorrow morning good night  okay i got victor but i called the national cemetery from the car  and you know what they can bury an urn  they call it inurnment we can do it today at 3  why are you so determined to sabotage our business  i dont think paul knew how his brother really felt   nate why do you even care  because its what victor wanted  and he deserves it he got a raw fucking deal  victor kovitch did not hate the army watch these tapes he made in the gulf  yes sir fuck me sergeant   fuck yeah give it to me  come on private  oh come on come on that was funny  i have someplace i have to be  dave dave its okay i watch porn too  so you guys taking the psa this afternoon too  yeah  so what happens to you guys  i go to uc irvine and northwestern law  meet a totally great guy hes a triathlete  we get married and i practice law for eight years  and we get really rich and then i have two great kids   so youre like unbelievably happy  kind of  i get a masters in french and then live in paris for 6 months  and hate it so i come back become a tv development executive  and i work out all the time  im fairly miserable and have a slight substanceabuse problem   but you look great  thanks  i start an interiorlighting design firm with my college roommate  and it totally takes off  and then i die of ovarian cancer before im 30   oh that sucks  tell me about it  well good luck  what a freak   father jack  david come in sit  and call me jack were beyond that   meeting over already  yes   damn  we all admire clarks energy  but there is some concern that he may end up being divisive  as you said yourself if we have to start over from the beginning  and find some conservative lap dog who wont challenge anybody  yeah thats what we need here  scotch  no thank you   clark thought he came on too strong  i liked him jack  the world would be better if there were more like him  i just dont think that hes a good fit for st barts  do you really think that father clark would be happy here  why should he be happy how happy are you  youre right im not happy  my life is very complicated and confusing  ive experienced a lot of loss recently my father and my  and the thing that helps me deal with it is having a place  that hasnt changed like everything else in my life  theres a reason they call it a sanctuary  i think the majority of our congregation feels the same way  and my responsibility is to them not you  well ive got a business to run  yo  speaking  yes  what can i do for you mr gilardi   here this is good choice here  i dont like yellow  the bridesmaids dresses are lilac  if the flowers are yellow its gonna look like an easter egg hunt  how about white tulips very simple  just bunched together with a ribbon  i was kind of thinking i would be the only one with white flowers  or you could be the only one holding a gorgeous bouquet of color  against your white dress  people do that  its your day you can do whatever you want  dont you think that would be pretty   i love the tulips thing  tulips are one of my favorite flowers  so graceful and classic like little ballerinas  only reason i even met victor was i jumped off a humvee and broke my feet  here i am in the hospital with this guy whos dying listening to me complain  playing cards giving me his dessert  i wish he didnt die it sucks  thank you  have you heard from paul yet  not since i told him his brother was ready to be picked up  well without his consent in writing i cannot allow this funeral to take place  fine  at least well know we made an effort  when we were in the gulf  victor used to make these videotapes to send home to his family  we were always giving him a hard time  messing him up he was a real good sport  the perpetual optimist   so my brother ready  yes hes right in here   what is this  victors friends wanted to say goodbye  the hospital referred them its no problem for us  and no charge to you   excuse me are you his brother  yes im paul  this man here i dont know if you people know it  was like a lion for victor  he made federal waves over victors disability case  i found a couple pictures of us playing baseball  vic was a lousy batter but a pretty good infielder  hes grinning like such a fool in these  i thought you might like them   is that you  yeah   you sick  no  never got sick i dont know why  a lot of guys i knew over there did  thanks  thank you for letting victor have his military burial  even though i know you were against it  im sure this means a lot to him  what the fuck is this military burial shit  its an option that can easily be canceled at no charge to you  vic didnt want a military funeral you think im lying  i think he was afraid to tell you what he wanted  he filled out those forms he kept the videos  they filled out those forms this is all fucking army pr   i threw those forms in the trash  ill call the service off  he kept saudi arabian candy for 10 years   you just want to jack up your price  no its paid for  i want your brother to have the funeral he wanted for himself  because thats his right  victor wanted to believe he died for something you wanna take that away  jesus  hes the only family i had left  and he cant even tell me what he wants when hes dead  he thought i wouldve talked him out of this  and hes right i wouldve  why dont you sit with his friends  glad to have you here man   where is ruth  shes in the back  crying  what is wrong  its the smell of the flowers   youll get used to it  i am used to it  today i helped people choose flowers for weddings  for anniversaries for new babies  i cant remember being surrounded by so much happiness  im used to the smell of flowers meaning something completely different  im used to people crying and being exhausted  people being shattered  do not worry we get funerals too  im so happy i cant wait to come back tomorrow  youre not going to be like this every day though right  this flag is presented on behalf of a grateful nation as a token  of our appreciation for honorable and faithful services  rendered by your loved one  give it to one of his friends  i love you david  i always will  i could get hit by a bus on the way to the desert tonight  just wanted to make sure you knew that  i love you too   you did the right thing today  i know feels kind of good doesnt it   hello  she cant go  why not  she has to help me pick prints

these pictures  and sometimes i see amazing things  and sometimes i just see shapes and thats when i go blind  because what if i lost the ability to tell the difference  for real   for good  you wont  you say that and give me your eyes  but what if one day i cant give them back to you  well that wont happen we wont let that happen  god this is crap  this is pretentious derivative crap  well then
