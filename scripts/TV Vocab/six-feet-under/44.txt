anybody right now  even if its just sex then   sex can be very healing  its ok for us to be celibate if we want to   thank you claire  then maybe you should get a job  ive been trying its not easy these days   whos supposed to take care of maya  us her family  i think its best if i look after my daughter thank you  dont you think whats best for maya is to have a healthy father  mom all i do is think about whats best for maya ok  a bereavement group  i was a grief counsellor for three years i know what a load of crap this is  it actually helps to spend time with others going through the same experience   then why didnt you go when dad died  i did   you didnt tell us that  i went once a week for several months   one of us could have gone with you  it would have been wrong to burden you  maybe i could have used it too why is this family so repressed  i can tell you from experience  you wont wake up one morning and find its all over you have to grieve  i know that i have grieved ive done big grieving ok  i just feel like im  stuck in this quicksand and something bigger than me is holding me back  it just doesnt make sense  something as stupid as that  falling in the shower  it was my fault  no no of course not it was an accident  no i dragged her out to the hot tub  made her drink tequila  got her all dizzy   it was our anniversary  mr thornton  i think your wife was very much in love  and did all those things because she enjoyed doing them with you  why did this happen  out of nowhere for no reason  i was a good husband  i loved her i took care of her  why is god punishing me  i dont think god punishes people like that mr thornton  no of course not   hello ruth  hello becky   pyjamas  hard to get them long enough for george   hes such a large man  nothing wrong with that  no no im not complaining how are things with hakim   he got back together with his wife  oh no  yeah i guess i was just a pretty toy to him 2240   im so sorry  im not  i left a bag of burning dog shit on his porch as a little parting gift movin on  you know george has a son   he got a job  i believe hes independently wealthy   whats his name  kyle hes about 40 rather boyish  does he have a moustache i like them   no but i believe hes capable of growing one  why is he still single   hes a very complex man  i like a man who can keep me guessing  maybe ill have you both over for dinner  ill call you  shall we start anyone  they remind me of katy grannans earlier work  yes they certainly do  i like them  theyre really simple unpretentious pretty  like claire herself  i wonder though  if theyre a little too staged  maybe  are they staged claire  well yeah its hard to take a candid selfportrait  not just staged butstagy  and maybe theyre a little stiff  dead  thats what i like about them  this girl whos like dead  and beyond everything  beyond hunger beyond sex beyond boredom  and really its so beautiful to be in that state  like nothing can reach her  nothing can get to her   see i wouldnt say dead i would say empty  yeah definitely empty   was that your intention claire  no  i was trying to capture the stillness i sometimes feel  really not emptiness apathy  no stillness  ok what are you doing in this picture  nothing being still  what are you looking at what are you thinking   nothing  ok  i thought you were actually thinking something deep  ok let me ask you this and feel free to roll your eyes  but do you really want to perpetuate the idea of woman as a vacant vessel  ls this more lesbian stuff  yes i have to meet my quota so i get my toaster oven  im not trying to perpetuate anything i dont have an agenda   i shoot from a more instinctual place  an empty place   im not empty  no of course not  maybe with your next work we can see something that actually is inside you   may i help you  oh im just looking for rico  federico  rico rico   hello  hey its me  god im glad you called i hated the way we left things this morning   how did we leave

wrap him up and take him home   now what  youre being wildly inappropriate as usual  and as usual i am feeling irritated and resentful  well thats your shit   is richard braun teaching here  yeah my cognitive psych class  you dont believe in all that cognitive crap do you  you have to dig through the past  knowing where behaviour comes from doesnt change the behaviour  you just know where the behaviour comes from  ricky braun has the most unusually shiny penis i went on this retreat with him  when hed get out of the hot tub the water would just bead up on his schlong   do you suppose he kept it oiled  i dont care mom hes a good teacher  hes an exhibitionist and an idiot  maybe you should teach the class  here no thank you darling im not that desperate  this happens to be an excellent program  it doesnt matter where you do your training youll be a great therapist  you really have this uncanny understanding of interpersonal dynamics  which youve always had  you have a problem applying the principles to your own life so often the case   i was wondering when the insult would come  were exactly the same  whos a bigger train wreck than i  so hows it going with olivier  hes a very passionate man hes a lot of fun if you dont take him too seriously  he is completely supportive of my decision to have vaginal rejuvenation surgery  oh mom  darling ive had a couple of children you especially took your toll  no one wants to fuck a glass of water if you know what im saying  speaking of children are you still interested in having one   i think so  you think so  and is joe the man you want to have them with   i think he is yeah  you think he is  hows the sex  its fine  its creative its interesting  dear god you have to dump him  mom when i brought him to dinner you said he was the one  i didnt realise at the time that the sex between the two of you was this cerebral exercise  thats not good sex is something you should feel not something you should think  i think to keep from behaving in a compulsive and destructive manner  thanks to my early exposure to compulsive and destructive sexual energy  you just said that poring over the past is not important   change the behaviour  i have changed the behaviour  then what are you complaining about  this is probably the healthiest relationship that i have ever been in  im not gonna dump him  as a matter of fact were talking about moving in together  now thats the brenda i know  i hate your new hair  i could feel the gentle rocking of the train as we started to move  and he was so handsome sitting there against the window smiling at me  when i woke up i could hardly believe i was this old lady in bed all by myself  and whats odd is i had completely forgotten about that trip  it was so long ago  i have so many memories of my time with walter  i cant even remember them all  memories are nice arent they ellen   their atm is down  really  i got no cash so i tried to use my credit card to get a gas can and a couple gallons of gas  im way over my limit so he wouldnt take it  i begged him please and he laughs in my face   how humiliating is that  sorry  man i must have been a serious asshole in a previous life  i dont think it works that way things just happen  at least i stole a pack of gum   you stole that  i figured he deserved it  want a piece  now youre my accomplice   oh shit  whats wrong  poor grandmas still waiting for me id call her but shes deaf she never hears the phone  let me buy the gas can and gas ok   no way  really its no big deal im going to  only if you take me to an atm so i can pay you back  ok  an apple some sharp cheddar and a hunk of crusty bread  and somehow it all tastes little bit better  when you cut it with your grandfathers pocket knife  ive been thinking we should invite kyle over for dinner   why  so he can meet my friend becky  whos quite adorable in her own way and quite single   ruth what are you doing  im trying to arrange a dinner  i can make my vegetable lasagne and becky said she   youre meddling  its not meddling to introduce two people  when one of them is my son who leaves boxes of shit on our doorstep  oh yes thats meddling  but dont you want to help him  i only agreed to meet with him  because i wanted you to see firsthand what a mess he is  if id had any idea  christ  look  just leave it alone ruth ok  you deal with your messedup children and ill deal with mine  i dont care for that tone  im very disappointed in you ruth  very  when you lose somebody you love you truly have lost a part of yourself  you shared a lifetime with this person  so its only natural to have moments when youre feeling completely lost  what if you havent  well if you dont feel lost  i didnt get to share a lifetime with her  im sorry ive been listening to your stories and theyre  theyre upsetting because i dont have that  i dont have a lifetime of memories we were just getting started  just working things through  and  now i have a  i have a twoyearold daughter who doesnt have a mother and so she  she has to get everything from me because im all there is but i dont  i dont know what to do with that  most of the time i just  i just feel numb  and then sometimes i feel justjust terrified  then sometimes i just feel so angry but then i dont want to be this bitter guy  so i try to deal with it because i dont want my daughter to have to live with that poison  i try and be thankful  i try so hard to be thankful  and i am thankful thankful i have a beautiful child that lisa gave me  yet some days some days i just feel like
