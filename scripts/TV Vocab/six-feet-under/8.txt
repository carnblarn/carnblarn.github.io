irreverence was my drug of choice  still is i guess  nate mate  im really glad you and lollies hooked up  i mean personally i couldnt handle her playing freud all the fucking time  i dont give a fuck why i am the way i am  well she is a complicated woman  no shes not  i found this in a shoebox and made you a copy  oh thats killer billy oh its a great shot mate  oh look at you in your sluggos  poor

drongo   when was that taken  two summers ago in perth  i thought you said you hadnt seen him in a decade  no i said connor hasnt been to la in a decade  where do you sleep mate  because that sleeping

man  havent you ever slept with a woman and not had sex with her   no  outside get some air  go outside get some air fuck you  im leaving  have fun with your aussie fuck mate fucker  damn you are versatile  you think im being a possessive asshole for wanting brenda for myself  wanting to feel connected with someone doesnt mean youre possessive  or an asshole but until theres a commitment  you have no claim on her  a woman doesnt have to wait to be chosen anymore   she can do the choosing  lf she waits too long  the right guy might just move on  youre right dear youre so right  a chartered bus out of vegas overturned on the 10 last night  fortyfour passengers most of them dead   you sleep well last night  yes thank you  you sleep at all last night   howd the funeral directors test go  oh man i choked   what a cluster fuck  language   you just said asshole  nate i need you to pass that test  yeah well dave i need you to lighten up on me starting now  hey  first of all i just want to thank you guys for everything that youve done for me  but i think its time for me to move on i have to think about my future   my familys future  youre leaving us oh dear  you havent given us a chance to counter kroehner  am i a partner  you guys didnt even talk about it  thank you federico  im sorry that we cant offer you more  you will always have a job waiting for you here  kroehner will never appreciate how good you are  youll just be a part of their assembly line  yeah well see  a word of advice guys dont turn your back on gilardi  well so much for loyalty  nate hes given us five years he doesnt owe us anything  nobody owes us  my only defense is i think i was hallucinating  that and the thought of you with another man makes me crazy  sorry  im just a guy that way   so wheres connor  oh god i threw him out  theres only so much of him i can take   so you forgive me  sure why not  good now its your turn   you want me to apologize  yes  for trying to use billys meltdown and connors visit to push me away  for being impatient with my very valid emotional response to each one  and for always asking me to adjust my behavior and feelings  but never being willing to do that yourself  okay thats fair  i apologize   part of you wants me to bail  yeah youre probably right  why  because weve already gone further than i have with anybody since  since a long time ago  because every time ive ever believed in a happy ending  ive gotten severely fucked  sorry  well do me a favor  promise me from here on out i am the only naked man in your bed  and in your life  im serious bren promise me  i promise  i love you and i want to be with you for the long haul  but theres a limit to the amount of shit i will put up with  did you just make me a lifetime commitment  right before the thinly veiled threat of abandonment  well i dont remember using the word lifetime  oh well i wont hold you to it  sorry im so weird about intimacy  i guess spending your childhood being picked apart  by behavioral psychologists will do that  yeah well not being able to sleep at night  because you know your basements full of dead people takes its toll too  sorry  nate fisher  remember that chartered bus that overturned last night  they were all locals were getting three   the first family will be here in an hour  im on my way   and try to curb your enthusiasm  this will be tough without rico  see you later   good lord what did they do to you  dont ask  so did mom freak when you told her i got busted  i didnt tell her   okay why  i dont know other stuff came up  it seemed like a low priority   are you going to  probably not  im sorry the crossroads thing didnt work out like you had hoped  actually it was kind of amazing  i think i really learned something valuable  everything i think i know is wrong  hey what happened to that guy keith  it just didnt work out   thats too bad  life goes on  that it does  well theres work to be done
