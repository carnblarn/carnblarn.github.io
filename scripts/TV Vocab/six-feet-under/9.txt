two years ago tomorrow  we dont have anniversaries   i never agreed to anniversaries  just you and me alone in the woods  naked under the stars just like it was at the beginning  tomorrow is such short notice  i cant promise anything but ill try  my mom wants to know how quickly we can do this  well id suggest a viewing in two days to allow proper restoration  viewing  for friends family you can make it as small or as large as you wish  no i cant see him in a box i cant  all right  ms dimas seeing your son before you bury him might help you to let go  no i dont want to see him  of course well arrange for a closedcasket ceremony  will three days give you enough time  yeah thats gonna be fine   nate will show you to the door  thanks  what happened  a 6yearold found a gun and was playing with it   oh jesus  yeah  they gave me this at the hospital  its some sort of receipt i dont know i dont know if you need it but  what was he doing here   gabe  its okay  hey  my brother just told me im so sorry  i didnt know where else to go my grandmothers funeral was here  yeah of course  my moms waiting for me to unlock the car  i thought we were supposed to encourage people to have a viewing  well sometimes people dont want that  well sometimes you dont want to work any harder  when faced with the option of not having to restore a childs head  thats been blown to bits yeah i dont want to do that do you  we cant force someone to do something theyre not ready to do  because we think its the right thing because it will make us feel better   can i help you  roses are if you love somebody right  roses are the classic choice but other flowers could achieve the same effect  what if you were gonna ask her to marry you  oh how lovely  well roses would be the perfect choice  but she turned out to be a cheating coward  and ran off with some shithead that she met at traffic school  what color would you give a coward   yellow yellow  great  twelve dozen yellow roses sent to this address please   what would you like the card to say  fuck you cunt  i think it would be more personal if you write that  yes yes  i have to take the day off tomorrow and saturday  why  i was supposed to have plans with a friend and i forgot  is it with that man  the one with the funny little car that picks you up  its an electric car and its very good for the environment   why are you laughing  because you are not   you like this man  can i have the days off or not  take go i dont care we will miss you  beep beep  beep beep   brenda  hey there  ill be right out i just got out of the shower   how was work  it sucked  like i figured i failed that funeral directors test  there was this intake meeting this morning i totally fucked up  and i just picked up a dead  all in all its been a pretty bad day  goddamn it  sometimes i feel like i dont have any fucking idea what im doing  its like i made this bullshit decision to go into this business  for all the wrong reasons and now its too late   its never too late  jesus billy  what do you live here now  no brenda just gave me a shiatsu ive been kind of tense lately  so   bad day  yeah   well ive had my share of those  well i dont doubt that  i dont really feel like cooking so you guys decide what were having delivered  that shit was all over the news six years old right  fuck some people should just not be allowed to have kids  she just sat there like a ghost  just like shed been erased   i felt so fucking helpless  oh god  that poor woman  theres a tribe in nigeria that throws a dead babys body  into the bush because they believe if buried  the dead infant would offend the earth gods which bring fertility and food  the chinese consider the death of a child a bad death  the parents and grandparents arent expected to go to the funeral  or the balinese mother whos counseled to be cheerful after her infants death  because grief makes one vulnerable to illness and malevolent demons  well that was informative  yeah i thought itd be good to read up on your boyfriends line of work  what a man does is well its who he is  right nate  yeah  a man should know the history of his chosen profession  if he expects to be anything but an amateur   so im an amateur  i prefer the term dilettante  and what are you billy  running around with your camera taking pictures of peoples lives  boys  you think knowing a bunch of arcane national geographic shit is gonna  help me cope with a 6yearold who shot himself in the head  there are plenty of places in the world where a kid dying is pretty common  but we cant deal with it because a dead child  is the greatest failure of a culture that believes its reversed the order of nature  this was an accident this wasnt nature  you know what i find interesting  if you lose a spouse youre called a widow or a widower  if youre a child and you lose your parents then youre an orphan  but whats the word to describe a parent who loses a child  i guess thats just too fucking awful to even have a name   i was worried you werent gonna show  i just got tied up at work  believe me i need this after the day i had  this ought to help   oh what is it  x ecstasy   you ever done it  no cant say that i have  youre gonna love it   are you gonna take one too  im already there lets dance   im not a very good dancer  you will be  david  david here you gotta keep drinking this  she was only 63  thats so young  isnt that young  have you thought about what kind of funeral youd like for your mother  it has to be beautiful it has to be beautiful  well we can offer you a wide variety of services ranging from  simple to more formal to to anything you might need  yes anything at all  its a good thing i was there you know  i mean gabe was so wrecked i was the one who had to trash his weed  seriously if the police found that shit itd be way worse you know   hey andy  hey   hows gabe  hes okay i guess   well have you talked to him  not really  well are you gonna see him later  i dont know its real weird over there   the mothers like all freaked  yeah but what about gabe  look morticia im not interfering its too much to get into you know   i thought you were his friend  why dont you fuck off bitch  if youre so worried why dont you go fuck him again thatll cheer him up  nice thats nice  yeah  by the way parker told me how one of your testicles is like  freakishly small like a peanut   is that true  thats not true  for later   you have a headache dear  yeah i thought i did  im throwing in a load of laundry if you need some done  by the way im going camping with hiram this weekend   im leaving this afternoon  great  im doing whites first   fuck david david  david david  david david  are you all right you look pale  no im fine its just a headache thats all  okay youre in this like total danger zone gabe dimas is a dick  im sorry his brothers dead but dont think that means hes not a dick  i just havent seen him around so i was worried  if you hook up with him now its gonna be like total emotional rape  whatever he feels for you is gonna be wrapped up in some guiltgrief fuckfest  you better stay away from that shit im not kidding  so you failed a test big whoop  you want to be helpful to the people that walk in through your door  so you have to be one of those people  okay  i chose three funeral homes from the yellow pages at random  ive always felt an uncontrolled sample group provides more reliable data  what you want us to pretend to be purchasing a funeral  look up the first address i think its in sherman oaks  come on itll be fun  hello gabe  is anybody home  oh mrs dimas im sorry the door was open  is gabe around   we can still leave  why what are you afraid of  humiliating myself wasting someones valuable time  dont be so leftbrained  im so sorry to keep you waiting  now how can i help  its my parents  they were killed this morning in an accident  im terribly sorry  it was a a helicopter  went down and there was an explosion  oh god i cant do this  its not right they were in the prime of their lives  everybody dies we all die  everything we ever care about will disappear  so whats the fucking point of living  can i suggest matching caskets  thats it  thats what you have to offer me in my time of grief merchandise  we have nothing to learn here  water purifier rope  bear bell flashlight  toilet paper and yes its biodegradable  bird caller binoculars  im sure you have everything i know you have everything you always do  it wouldnt be fun to get up there and realize we forgot the matches would it  or the champagne  hiram thats just decadent  was it expensive we shouldnt waste it  waste it its our anniversary  claire youre home early you remember hiram  hi   how was school  i have a headache  hiram and i are going camping  your dinners in the refrigerator and ill be back tomorrow  its a very beautiful time of the year  okay well you two have fun  we should probably leave if we want to beat the rushhour traffic  ruth honey whats wrong  my children dont need me anymore  lets think of this as a celebration  of your uncles life  now the titan is an excellent choice for a distinguished gentleman  its solid mahogany its handfinished burlwood and nickel accents  and grace field  grace field is a lovely place for interment  its serene its pastoral  how much  well after you sign the contract we take care of everything  theres no worry theres no pain  how much  it comes to just under 20000  youre charging  12000 for the titan  what is that like a 300 percent markup  i could come down to 10  and grace field is in between a power station and a freeway  there are nicer cemeteries  but theyre just a little bit more expensive  no thanks  well try and find somewhere that doesnt just want to swindle us  nice tie   this business is a total racket  what business isnt  you know sometimes i wish i could be this  completely selfish asshole that didnt give a shit about anything  and i could just work at some mindless job that paid me a fuckload of money   no you dont  it would make my life a lot easier  you dont want your life to be easy  gabe  hi  i didnt know if anybody was home  did you ring the bell  i just i came by to drop off this stuff  okay  its my brothers soccer clothes  i thought that he might like to get buried in them  you think thats okay  yeah yeah i think thats really nice  i went to your house  you see my mom  yeah  just like a zombie just sits there  i dont know why she blames herself its my fault i killed him  gabe no it was an accident  it wouldnt have happened if id been watching him  my mom cant even find anthonys dad to tell him what happened  probably moved we havent seen him in like two years  oh that sucks  hes a fucking drunken dipshit he used to kick my ass just to prove he could  you know when people would call you those things like  cemetery girl and vampira  yeah  i never thought that was funny  i should go would you just make sure your brother gets these  of course  hey look if you need anything like to talk  or something you can call me  all right   where do you want to hang the food  cant it wait till after dinner  ive already taken out what were going to eat id rather not risk it  im sorry its inconvenient  but would you prefer we were mauled in our sleep by bears  ruth you need to relax  hello im rosemary how can i help you  hi i need to make arrangements for a funeral  all right  my wifes in the restroom shell be out in a minute   can i ask who the funeral is for  its for me  bet you dont get too many people shopping for

needles thing kind of gets in the way   he just wants you to be happy  he just doesnt want me to die  okay its just too fucked up brenda i cant do it i cant   hes not ready  its hard for him  probably harder than it is for you  that was the most fucked up thing youve ever done to me   sorry  that was like the shit  you pulled on those doctors to get a rise out of them   are you gonna start barking at me  i might   what you did just now was not funny  well it wasnt meant to be  you counsel people about death every day nate  when death is what youre most afraid of   whats wrong with this picture
