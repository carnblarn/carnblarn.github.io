sponge applicator into cold water  and applying it to barbies lips cheeks and eyelids  you get a flourish of glamorous colour  im telling taylor you took it out of the box  when i was a kid i used to have gi joes  they were always getting courtmartialled  which in my version meant that they had to stand naked in front of the other dolls  is that something you wanna act out  i think weve had enough excitement for a while   the threeways  yeah   what about them  maybe theyre not the best thing for us  really that wasnt you the other night begging us to arrest and interrogate you  im not saying theyre not fun   so what are you saying  im just starting to feel weird about it   ok fine  fine   yeah whatever  that is so not fair  you ask me to tell you how i feel and when i do you just shut down  i dont feel like talking about it right now  youre tense because were going to see your father  were going to my greataunts funeral  where your father will be and whose house well be staying at  so i dont have a problem with him  really  ive been working on that stuff in my individual therapy   really  thats all i talk about  how come youve never told me about any of this  some things are between me and the therapist   i tell you everything  because you want my approval  no its because i love you   the other gentleman hes your brother  yes david   thats who helped me  he left this morning for a friends funeral  he sold me a casket   yes the cameo rose  its not good enough  mr fester the cameo rose is an excellent casket  no i want something nicer for martha  it doesnt matter how much it costs  i know when we lose someone we wanna show how much we loved her  and were at a loss as to how to do that  and we spend a lot of money on something that isnt really necessary  i dont care  dont you understand  this is the last thing ill ever be able to do for my wife  i was a bad husband  affairs and all that shit  i got cancer thought i was gonna die  but i got better  i got a second chance  and i realised how much i loved her  and its been really good the last few years  i just want to love her some more  i owe her  god i loved her i really did  of course you did and she knew that  she was everything to me  i am so sorry  nate do you remember when i used to make that casserole with the  i used to do this for your father  his shoulders would get so full of knots  its such a stressful job  its ok baby its ok   you want the front page  no i cant deal with depressing news  i dont remember this book being so dark  these kids in the orphanage are being tortured  thats the best part where they have to take a bath in iced water  isnt that kind of inappropriate for kids  were human beings we all have a sick craving for that kind of dark fantasy even kids  ive got enough dark reality i dont need the fantasy  jesus  nurse caterwauls making nathaniel and isabel cane each other  read that part out loud  youre sick  if you mean suffering from bipolar disorder with psychotic episodes then yes i am  this is good claire its lovely  the blurriness the way the light seems too much  as if theres a secret fire in her spilling out for a moment  and you were there to capture it  excellent work  thanks  it only turned out this way because i accidentally dragged the shutter  i was totally gonna reshoot it  but hes right it works  its really good  i wonder how much of art is accidental  maybe magritte when he was painting his listening room  was like damn i made the apple too big again  hello im being clever over here   shit  what  the blades dull its fucking up everything   use another one  i got ten mats to cut i dont have time   why dont you just change the blade  i dont want to change the blade  its shit i hate it i hate everything i hate it   its shit its all fucking shit  good  a tantrum this is an opportunity to learn people  russell you hate your work because you secretly hate yourself  which means youre still only thinking about yourself   whatever  yeah whatever  but i understand the impulse  i once filled the trunk of my car with all my latest work  and then lit the car on fire  and let it roll down the streets of montmartre  thats interesting because everything you do is just so fucking fascinating  such vitriol and such rage  and why arent you putting this into your work  olivier if you know so much about art and life  how come you ended up being such a pathetic poser  who needs people half his age to prop him up and make him feel good about himself  he could have at least made the effort to slam the door  young people have absolutely no commitment today  go back to work   hey  hey   you ok  yeah   sorry about that just a little meltdown  yeah   i can stay go another time  no youre going  you need a break you deserve a break   you wanna get rid of me  no of course not  you wanna get to your sisters before dark  i feel like a terrible mother for thinking this and i know im gonna miss her  but im kind of looking forward to a couple of days without maya  thats because youre a handful arent you   did you make a list for me  a list for what  i dont know usually you make lists  what time im supposed to feed maya what i can and cant feed her   you already know all that stuff  yeah ok  dont let your mother bathe her she scrubs her like a potato  ill bathe her  ok  im gonna miss you   well walk you to the car  i dont want maya to see me go  i just dont   well goodbye then  i love you  be good to daddy right  i love you  bye   arthur are you busy  im putting away my socks  but ive become confused as to which is paired with which  they all look exactly the same  thats the dilemma  arthur i really need to talk  ok  quite frankly id like to know how you feel about the course our relationship is taking  weve been on quite a serendipitous journey havent we  and where do you think its headed  surely someplace divine  does that mean you know intimacy  i love intimacy intimacy is my best friend  arthur im so confused  do you find me at all attractive if you feel im too old  heavens no youre the perfect age for me ruth fisher   i am  absolutely  so how do you feel about us having you know sex  its just that weve been seeing each other for a while and not even a kiss   well not since  yes  i understand well  i believe that sex can be when two become one  it neednt always be painful  but it is indeed a very slippery slope  arthur have you ever had sex  i think i have in a sense  are there any other topics youd like to discuss  no no   hello  its this way   yeah i know the way  so whats the problem  were a couple and it would be nice if we could walk together like every other couple  especially considering im about to walk into a place filled with your every living relative  so walk faster then   oh please  now what  thats just tacky no one wants to see that  this ground is wet they should have put down more greens here  david its fine not everyone is such a perfectionist  im not a perfectionist just professional  no ones gonna even see these here  lets hope these guys remember to put your greataunt in her casket face up  look david here come my folks   try not to nag at me  i

the whites yet  im doing them right now  i have some kerchiefs and undershirts to do  some people call them wifebeaters which i think is funny  theres nothing funny about beating your wife  no of

that i was traumatised by the way you punished me and carla  that was abusive that was abuse   abuse  i know you did the best you could  you were probably repeating what happened to you but it did a number on me and carla  im to blame for your sisters drug problems  no i wanna acknowledge the truth about what happened so i can forgive you   you wanna forgive me  yeah  so we can have a real relationship while we still have time  what are you talking about i disciplined my children when they deserved it  i gave you a home i gave you food to eat  i taught you how to be a man you wanna

head off  its open come on up  the pizza man ready for your first taste of pepperoni  brenda hey  im sorry i didnt know where else to go and didnt have your number   no thats fine come on in  sure im not interrupting anything  no lisas gone im just introducing maya to some music that doesnt suck   whats wrong  billy  let me put maya down in her playpen  ever since your father died ive just flitted from man to man  i am so embarrassed  i mean look you got married when you were 19 thats how old i am  you never even got to have your sexual 20s so why shouldnt you do it now  you dont have to worry about us any more  no  did you know i got pregnant the first time i ever had sex  my god   with dad  of course  i thought you were gonna tell me i had some love child halfbrother somewhere  which i dont think i could handle right now  no it was nate  nathaniel and i had to get married right away  both our families were mortified  it changed my life for ever  do you ever wonder how your life would be different if that hadnt happened  i used to not any more   were you and dad in love with each other  yes  very much so at first  despite how we grew apart your father was the great love of my life  at least you had that im beginning to think i never will  you will everyone does but chances are it wont be anything like you expect  i miss dad you know  i feel like i hate how i just took him for granted my whole life  and now hes gone and its too late for me to ever really know him  you know like as an adult  i miss him too  there will never be another man who will love me when im young and pretty  and always have that picture of me somewhere in his heart  mom youre still pretty god youre beautiful  why do you think all these men are always hitting on you  youre so sweet but look at the men  im sitting here crying over arthur   what should i do about him  run  i feel sorry for him though hes so naive  yeah i feel sorry for russell too  i mean i hate him  but i feel sorry for him  mom why is it i attract every screwedup guy in the state  because they can see what a kind soul you have  that youre caring and sensitive  its the truth claire youre an angel  but the real question is why do you like them  its like ill fall for any guy who shows any interest in me  i guess we all wanna be loved  its hard to say no to that no matter who its coming from  right from the beginning there was this voice saying dont move in with billy  what do i do i move in with billy  so selfdestructive  maybe you wanted to believe the world is a better place than it really is   so im an idiot  no just a very positive person  that doesnt sound like me  its scary to hope things will turn out good because you risk being disappointed   wow youve really thought about this  no im talking out of my ass  i have no clue whatsoever  look all i know is youre a good person who deserves to be happy  so are you you know  well i should go   sure youre gonna be ok  yeah  youve got my number  thank you
