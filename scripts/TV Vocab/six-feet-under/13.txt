                expansion has slowed but then the economy has slowed  its only natural  no growth is the only thing that is natural mr gilardi  and growth is the only thing that is acceptable  now i

viewing   i just need you to sign  im serious david  dont worry about the cost she practically raised me i owe her  besides  she was loaded  and also i intend to sue the pants off that country club   i still need a signature  ive had it out for them  ever since my debut when one of the chinese busboys  made a really inappropriate comment about the neckline of my dress  ill be faxing you  jesus christ nate what took you so long  i told you i was taking the funeral directors licensing exam  i had to finish or wait until next march to take it again  oh god im sorry  its just  i have to go see billy in the hospital  i have to nate   all right  he needs me i can feel it   will you come with me please  of course  thank you   so whatre you up to this weekend  i dont know  probably come up with some creative way to avoid my family   why  im having this big party on saturday  yeah  yeah my dad and my stepmom are renewing their vows in hawaii   youre not going  no way  they do this like every six months its so not a big deal  and guess who has the keys to her dads total party house in bel air  im beginning to see how this little miss perfect act pays off  yeah why do you think i do it  so whats up with you and mr od  shut up  no i was just wondering if hes like you know  over it  yeah he is  hes incredibly strong  hes much stronger than he thinks  well thats a good thing right  i guess  bring him to the party if you want  okay i will  im sure he hates me  the one person he thought he could count on and i had him committed  well it was for his own good  he always felt the entire world was against him  its all because of my fucking mother  she had children as like fashion accessories  you had no choice he couldve harmed himself he did harm himself  im so afraid of what hes gonna say to me  brenda you cannot let him hurt you anymore  for your good and for his  what if he thinks i hurt him   what if hes right  you saved him  ill go by bristol farms and pick up some of those dried porcini mushrooms  you wanna take me out to dinner  no theres nothing wrong with that its just  hiram do you realize that youve never taken me out before  i suppose because of nathaniel we just always got in the habit of staying in  i have to run  can you pick me up at is 8 too late  no at the house bye now   i need you to stay and work tonight  what  its very busy right now  we have three unfilled orders thats nothing  and robbies coming in at 6 tomorrow morning  its coming up on fathers day very busy time  no one sends flowers for fathers day which is the day after tomorrow  you think well get a rush of orders tonight  yes you have to stay  change your plans  no  this is my business i am boss here  im not debating that but your authority does not extend to my personal life  i dont care about your ridiculous personal life  going to sleep someplace outside in a tent like refugee  yes you do you dont like me seeing hiram because youre jealous  its no longer flattering its just irritating i have chosen hiram  im sorry if i somehow made you feel thats not the case because it is  i wish youd stop behaving like a spoiled child  ive dealt with enough children in my life  im finally at the point where they get along without me and i wont go back  you are fired   you cant do that  i just do do that  now you can go get out of here youre fired go on get out  its a piece of cake  just the one bump on her head and a pretty big bruise  but most of its covered by her hair which lucky for us  is remarkably thick for a woman her age  what  tracy wants to change the casket the flowers  the music and the times of the viewing and the ceremony  how am i supposed to put together a resplendent funeral in two days  when she cant make up her fucking mind  by telling her that once she signs a contract she cant pull any of this shit   thats what id do if i was a partner  which youre not so let me handle this  i need you to do everything you can to make her look the best she possibly can   i always do that david  of course you do federico  its just that its a very important funeral and we stand to make a lot of money   which i wont see any of  we just gave you a raise  do you want me to come with you  no i dont want him to know that youre here  ill be right out here if you need me  okay  billy  hi  hi  howre you doing   fine  yeah  yeah  whatever i was feeling before im not feeling now  im so sorry billy  its so weird  i love you more than anything  and i couldve seriously hurt you  it all made sense at the time   you know  i hate this  i hate that my blood makes me crazy  i hate that i cant function without being chemically altered   i hate that i fucked up your life  you havent   i did that on my own  no you deserve to be happy  i dont  i must have some weirdass karma   we both do  no its just me  the fact that i couldve hurt you like that  upsets me like nothing ever has  and when i look at you  all i want to say is im sorry  please forgive me  and inside i feel like tears are streaming down my cheeks  but theyre not are they  dont cry please dont cry  just because i cant  you be happy  i want you to be happy ill be happy if you are  okay  im so lost  inside  i wish that i could get out   but i dont think i ever will  youll be all right   youll be okay  its all right  its okay  youre so beautiful  how come theres no home movies of me when i was a kid  im not sure  after i bought that new super8 camera we filmed everything the boys did  after you came along i guess we sort of felt like you know  been there done that  yeah i know which made me feel like totally secondary thank you  cheer up kitten  maybe some of that attention you never got will motivate you  to get off your lazy ass and do something interesting with your life  i got fired today   that sucks  yes it does  if you wanna know the truth i was a victim of sexual harassment   what  nikolai wanted me to work late  to keep me from dinner with hiram when i refused he fired me   oh my god what a dork  i know can you believe it  i have a good mind to call a lawyer  well it sounds like youre better off out of there  i have a certificate in floral arranging i can get a job anywhere   screw nikolai  exactly  have you ever thought about getting married   sure ive thought about it but  weve been together almost a year  and you practically live at my house youve seen me at my worst   what other information do you need  weve been together six months bren  i didnt realize you were counting the days   im not  what you mark them off at night  like a prisoner in his cell like the count of fucking monte cristo  since when are you so hot on marriage  well i need to know where this is going i need to know if im wasting my time   what if i wanna have children  well you said you didnt  well do you i mean youre what 35  whats the longest relationship youve ever been in   this one  yeah well thats pathetic  you havent had a serious relationship since fucking high school  at least ive had a serious relationship at least i know what one is  you know how many guys wouldve left after all the psycho shit  youve put me through  now were getting to the point  this is whats really going on you wanna bail  no you want me to bail  look out  hey augustos christening is sunday afternoon  were thinking about having a party afterwards  for my folks and vanessas and  well our place is a little small  you think we could have it here  right now lilian montroses viewing is scheduled for 3 to 6 so  yeah yeah i know i was thinking after that  im only asking because i  i still think of your family as my family  and  i really want you all to be there  sure  wed be happy to let you have the party here  thanks boss  could you load me a hypodermic with some phenol solution for this bump  wouldnt you rather start with a compress  why an injection will get rid of the swelling and take care of the bruising   youre getting better at this dave  thank you federico  oh great now what tracys decided to have aunt lilian cremated  and her ashes placed in a faberge egg  can we do it by 7 tonight   i think you should look at this  well what is it  oh good grief  adult female unrestrained driver unconscious upon arrival  now responsive only to painful stimuli  blood pressure 8640 pulse 130 respiration 36 and shallow   brenda  she has a large scalp emulsion   why wont you talk to me  tracheas midline neck veins are flat   lactated ringers  what happened what happened  patient two adult male  sir youve been in an accident just stay calm okay everythings fine  adult male hes alert now but confused no memory of accident   why is her head in that thing  she had an injury shes gonna be okay   is she dead  shes fine shes gonna be fine   hows your sea bass  delicious thank you  ruth i need to tell you something and   im not proud of this  what is it  ive met someone  i never meant for this to happen i wasnt looking  yes well thats always when it does happen  well im not sure quite how to oh boy   im not quite sure how to say this  for heavens sake spit it out  id like to pursue it  things between you and i have felt well not exactly  and i feel a bond with this new person that  well the beginnings of a bond that could be something quite profound  all right  i thought youd be more upset  i wouldve thought the same thing  hiram please go explore  you owe it to yourself and whoever she is  maybe the two of you could have something as you say profound  lord knows we dont  well if it was this would be a lot more difficult wouldnt it  oh it is difficult  for me  lets order dessert thatll cheer you up  hey you  doctor says youre gonna be okay  well i like hearing that   what about you  im okay  banged up but apparently nothing broken  im sorry i almost killed you  goddamn it this is gonna send my car insurance premiums through the roof  when you were unconscious i prayed  you know how long its been since i prayed  and ive never prayed like this  so because of me youve become  born again  im so sorry  you are one incredibly difficult and sometimes infuriating woman  and i cannot imagine my life without you  promise me youll be a better driver  promise me youll take care of yourself and youll live as long as you can  because i dont know what id do if i lost you  so if you wanna get married im all for it  okay maybe i was overreacting  lets just take one step at a time shall we  okay   oh my god what a bad dream  yeah  father jack doesnt deny he performed a commitment ceremony for two lesbians  privately not in the church  the lambeth conference resolution on sexuality expressly condemns  the blessing of samesex unions  and councils against ordination of those involved  whether or not we agree with this resolution  do we really want our children learning from a man that ignores gods laws  i think we should ask jack to leave  and so do james and owen and im guessing david feels the same  actually i dont  the church rejects homosexual practice as incompatible with scripture  so because of their random genetics gay people should be denied  any romantic or sexual love  that is liberal claptrap  its not genetics it can be overcome  walter the only way you could know that for sure  is if its something that you overcame  and the only way you couldnt know  is if its something youre not strong enough to overcome  are you gay david  yes  then his vote cannot be counted here  thats ridiculous hes a deacon he gets a vote  david does not obey the laws of the church  without his vote its an even split how do you plan to resolve the matter  i think we should get the bishop involved  you sure you wanna do that  okay we talked about the flowers  i gave you the cd i burned with music for the viewing  i wish david were here  id much prefer to go over things with him than with some underling but  oh no no  no this wont do  what  well this right here theres a nick in the wood  oh no thats part of the grain  i dont think so  all right well well just have to return it and then get a new one  thats not possible  im sorry  theres nothing wrong with this casket even if there was its too late  to get another like it by tomorrow  i dont care how much it costs  this isnt about cost theres not another one of these available  we had to ship this one down from san francisco as it was  im very unhappy about this  if you want to call it off i can bring your aunts body up  and you can take it somewhere else  okay  hello  hiram theres nothing to talk about  no im not angry  oh mom ill probably be spending tonight at a friends house  what friend   parker mckenna  i dont know any parker   well you havent met her yet  oh good grief  hiram youre the one who wanted to break up  im sorry if youre having second thoughts because im not  men can be so stupid  yeah  id like for you to have parkers mother call me okay  okay  oh nate glad youre here  need to talk to you later   about what  in private  good morning how are you this morning  oh god  i was having the most incredible dream  i was swimming with dolphins  only we werent swimming we were flying  oh and drew barrymore was there  whatever you are on i would like some of it  she was like my best friend   hows your headache today  its better  oh my god and there was this shark following us  and i think it was courtney love   howd she look  she was in versace  are we supposed to believe that the same god who made us  wants us to be lonely and frustrated while the rest of the worlds  free to make love and have families  no god isnt that cruel   good for you for marrying two lesbians  my high school girlfriend  who do you think sent that fax  walter swears it wasnt him  i am so fucking tired of being ashamed  well just fight back you and me well fight them walters just a bully   well just bully him back  i dont think thats such a good idea  ive agreed to not officiate at any other gay weddings  and you get to stay   how do you feel about that  relieved  ive put in almost six years here at st barts  and id really prefer not to have to start over somewhere new  not at this point in my life  and i have a favor to ask of you  i need you to resign as deacon  otherwise walter will keep making noise until he gets his way  and id really prefer not to get the bishop involved   jack you cant give in to them  i know which battles can be won david  this is not one of them  i guess i just thought that you were  i dont know braver than that  im tired  im tired of trying to make it better here and never succeeding because of politics  i just dont have it in me right now  but how can you  youre gay  no im not  im not  people have always assumed that  but im not  sorry  more scotch  no thanks  i   i really dont wanna be here  oh get over yourself  i know you and parker had sex so what youre not the first guy i slept with  right but am i the last  maybe  if hes gonna get me in here ill use it but  oh my god  what the fuck do these people do  her fathers like some movie bigwig i think  invitation only   okay this is tragic  we can always leave  lets just find the bar excuse me  excuse me do you know where the bar is   over there  right   wheres parker  its not her house  this is a porn party im telling you theyre shooting a porno here  what the fuck is that   faggot  hey shut up my brothers a faggot  oh yeah im sorry  lets just say hi and leave okay  oh no this could be kind of fun  come on   hey parker  hey  this is a really nice house youve got here  i know so like of course i dont get to live here  i just get to trash it when theyre gone  this is warren this is claire   nice to meet you  and  gabriel  this is what concerns me this area of decreased attenuation its very faint  doesnt look like theres an acute injury but somethings not right  well shes gonna be all right isnt she  these are your cat scan results nate   mine  dont worry about brenda  hers was totally clean  so what do you think it is  id like to give you a shot of contrast dye  and do another cat scan to really know  oh hello mrs fisher  this is elise mckenna parkers stepmother claire asked me to call you  yes i just wanted to be sure theres proper adult supervision  if shes staying there  oh absolutely yes of course  dont worry for a minute  all right then  i dont want her drinking  there isn t even any liquor in the house  you see my husband and i are both alcoholics  and parkers fresh out of rehab so well take really good care of claire  i promise kisses   that was mean  what  a hollywood asswaxing party   everybodys wearing leather or rubber  seriously bro seriously   rip those fucking nipplerings out  no shit  where were you last night i called you and your mom was all i dont know  i was hanging with my girl  okay well while you were getting your toes sucked  we sucked down a free sixer from 7eleven   fuck we pulled a beer cow  a beer cow dude thats the shit  hell yeah a fucking beer cow  dink shut the fuck up dude what the fuck is a beer cow  oh shit it was mad so we go to buy some beer right  and we get to the counter but its like nobody has enough cash  so dink just starts fucking mooing at the top of his lungs at this guy right  so im like fuck it so i start mooing too  oh yeah but really fucking loud  like we just might totally go nuts  the guy was so fucking scared of us  it was hilarious man it was a total movie moment  fuck yeah and then we grab all the beer and we fly  we laughed for like five straight hours it was the shit  yeah dude a beer cow right  we gotta do that shit again man  i havent had that much fun since i was like 6   fucking beer cow right  yeah  fuck  well  we did find something that concerns me  my guess would be that its avm   arteriovenous malformation  what the fuck is that  abnormally enlarged and intertwined blood vessels in your brain  have you been experiencing any headaches  yeah i get headaches i take advil they go away  any vertigo nausea problems with your balance  nope   any fluctuation in your field of vision  like what  like a fluttering in your peripheral vision   once  do the headaches seem to affect  one side of the head more than the other  the left side sometimes  well i would like to schedule an mri for you as soon as possible  whats the worstcase scenario here   nate its way too early for that  you fucking tell me  not all vascular malfunctions of the brain become symptomatic  some however carry a significant risk of hemorrhage  so i could have a stroke  you could be at a higher risk for stroke or seizure than most  we need to do more tests to be certain  could i die from this  its possible yes  theres gotta be some kind of mistake i mean i dont smoke  i havent had any red meat since 1989 i run three miles a day  dont blow this out of proportion  there are treatments surgical options  even if it is avm you could live for another 50 years  however i would like to run a full cardiovascular profile on you  before you continue with the running okay  this happened yesterday for heavens sake why didnt you call me earlier  because i thought i was okay   well you are okay arent you  yeah yeah im fine  im a nervous wreck  are you all right dear  yes thank you  well i want you both to promise me that youll be more careful from now on  we promise  oh boy  this time its personal  whats wrong  nothing   so how old did you say you were  how old do you want me to be  parker   oh of course sorry  what do you want  nothing i was just looking for gabe im sorry  you drop a beer you have to pay for it  no no no no  moo  moo  hey say moo   where the fuck did you get that  say moo   moo  now get the money out of the register  go get the fucking car  moo   so do you think i should resign  what do you want to do  i dont wanna belong to a church thats so intolerant  and i dont wanna waste my time with a fight that cant be won  but i dont wanna just take it either  ive been doing that my whole fucking life and im fucking sick to death of it  and to top it all off im scheduled to do a devotional reading in mass tomorrow   you gonna do it  of course  theyre not gonna intimidate me into just disappearing  oh i came out to my mother   youre kidding  it was really uncomfortable   hows she taking it  hard to tell shes as weird as always  thanks for meeting me here today i just had to talk about it to somebody  and i could always talk to you  well im glad that weve managed to remain friends  listen i gotta run im meeting eddie later  hey he said he saw you at the candlelight vigil for marc foster  yeah yeah i was driving by on my way home  okay well thanks again  yeah well let me know how it all turns out  i will   take care david  you too  tell eddie i said hi  dont you

we just went to get some more beer   why did you miss me  not that much ego man  hi  can i help you  id like to speak to david if at all possible  well hes not here right now   well where is he  im not sure perhaps i can help you  perhaps you can that remains to be seen  my aunts viewing is tomorrow  and im not at all satisfied with the state of her casket  i spoke to one of your other employees about it earlier today  and he didnt seem to be the slightest bit concerned ill show you  ill show you  see right here its been nicked  how about we take 100 bucks off   i want a new casket  well im not sure thats an option  why does nobody around here seem to care about doing things right  if im not mistaken you havent even signed a contract right   thats not the point  so you could turn around in the end  say i never agreed and not pay  of course not thats ridiculous  yeah that is ridiculous  so im gonna go get that contract right now  and until you sign it you dont get to complain about anything else  i resent your implication  you ought to be thanking your fucking stars that youre alive and healthy  and that you dont work like a dog just to starve or get shot in the street  ill be right back with that contract  i thought this is what you wanted  its too little too late  what are you trying to get your wings   wheres your boyfriend i do like him  yeah you said that already  hell be headed over to my neck of the woods pretty soon  right here look at this   yeah  i like it  why you are here youre fired  dear lord have you been here all night  go drive in the woods with your man  who burns chicken in the funny little toy car  i came here to get my things before i go to church  i thought this would be a safe time not to run into you   is he rich  what no  so he is a good lover yeah  thats none of your business  because you are the kind of woman who needs a good lover  oh and why is that  because youre so scared of feeling  you are scared of your own heart  you should have a man who can touch you there  who sees your beauty  i hoping  he is this man for you  in your steadfast faith and love that through your grace  we may proclaim your truth with boldness  and minister your justice with compassion  for the sake of our savior jesus christ who lives and reigns with you  and the holy spirit one god now and forever  amen  amen  in thee o lord do i put my trust  let me never be ashamed  deliver me in thy righteousness  let me never be ashamed  theres a concept  ive been ashamed my entire life  i grew up thinking i was unworthy in the eyes of god instead of trusting god  not to be an ignorant frightened bigot  because of this ive made myself crazy  ive put myself in danger ive made a lot of mistakes  big mistakes  which all couldve been avoided if id just had faith  faith that maybe god really is love like we say  how am i supposed to spread gods love throughout the world  when i deny it to myself  god be with you all   really nice job  thanks   congratulations  thank you   oh david wonderful good to see you  thanks  thank you  david  i am so proud of you  that was great david   i didnt even know you were here  i had to see what you were

noticed this but shes kind of crazy  yeah i got a whiff of that  and thanks for staying in la and helping me run the business  things have been a lot more fun around here since youve been home  why thank you dave  look im gonna be late for augustos christening i gotta run  oh that crazyass niece is upstairs crying and wont come down  oh no i think this one is yours  okay  but im warning you i might just fucking punch her  tracy  my aunt lilian was the only person who ever really loved me  my parents didnt  my husband certainly didnt  and now shes dead  her husband died then her daughter died too  in this car crash on her 17th birthday  but aunt lilian just went on  she raised welsh corgis and she took up watercolors  and she loved me and now shes dead  ive never felt this alone in the world  and im used to feeling alone  i know what thats like and  now i find out that theres this  whole new level  why do people have to die  to make life important  none of us know how long weve got  which is why we have to make each day matter  and it sounds like your aunt lilian did exactly that   yeah she did  then you can be happy for her  for a life welllived  thats the most any of us can hope for  i go to funerals sometimes  funerals of people i dont even know  harold and maude is like my favorite movie of all time  i saw it when i was in junior high and it profoundly affected my
