                tad is that you  youre early  time to kiss your sweet ass goodbye cupcake  seriously several people told me that my scene  is really the only one thats even remotely scary  becky you make a major impact in this movie  somebody even said that angelicas scene it wasnt even scary at all  like it was funny and not in a good way  we have to make sure you dont get pigeonholed now  which is why i think you shouldnt show your tits anymore  what a piece of shit  i know it makes fucking blair witch 2 look like titanic  its just so fucking gratuitous  i think that what makes this movie different  is that the violence isnt so gratuitous  its more like the whole movie is about  the whole psychological nature of fear  i totally maxed out his visa card paying for it  then somebody in joe roths office saw it and said it was genius  and now we have three meetings  seriously you could write it ive read your poetry and its really good  i think i should direct it too  yeah and we should have this really hot sex scene all gritty and real  you know like european  im not showing my ass my manager says i need to stop showing my ass  you have a piece of toilet paper stuck to your shoe  shut up where   honey its not working  what  no no its not gonna happen for me  its not its not gonna happen for me  im sorry   whats wrong  nothing dont take it personally  dont make this about me  what am i not allowed to not have sex for once  is that what our relationship is now  wait a minute you woke me up by going down on me  i dont know whats wrong with me  maybe that car accident we had  gave me some weird oliversacksblowtothehead disease  sorry my whole life seems like a bad dream  its like somebody elses life  like if my life were a movie id fall asleep or id walk out   you still not seeing any clients  i cant  i cant face it  you know  sometimes you just got to force yourself to be active   when youre you know  like what  when youre what  you think im depressed   are you  yeah  doesnt mean i wanna talk about it  okay  this is my sisterinlaw angie   angelica  its nice to meet you  likewise and this is brody farrell   are you the next of kin  no  beckys parents died when she was two  she was raised by her grandmother who also died  she didnt really have anybody except us   i see can i ask who will be  the cast of the movie  were all pitching in to pay for it  were going to need one person to be designated as the   brody will do that  yeah  she was sort of my girlfriend  do you know what kind of service youd like  cheap  we provide a variety of services for the more budgetconscious client   sorry just let me turn this off  take it  i can handle it  please excuse me   david fisher  hi david its kevin miller  you answered my personal ad in the la weekly im the fireman  yes hi of course  we can start with the most simple of traditional funerals  which would include our american eagle casket here  i dont think we should bury her  becky was totally terrified of the dark  we can still have a viewing  during which the casket will never be closed followed by a cremation  thats good and then we could scatter her ashes some place she really liked  like griffith park or the lava lounge on la brea  i mean i think we can skip the casket  you sound like a really nice guy too  i am a really nice guy so do you want to meet for coffee later this afternoon  this afternoon sure i have something at 300 but i can meet you after that  great lets say at 400 at the up all night coffee house  ill be wearing a red baseball cap  great i love red its one of my favorite colors   of which i have several  okay see you then  this is a beautiful and unusual cremains vessel  the ashes actually fill these dolphins which are carved out inside  she wasnt really into dolphins  i remember somebody suggesting she boycott tuna  because of the whole dolphinsgettingcaughtinthenet thing  and she said  fuck dolphins i want a nicoise salad   what are these  those are keepsake miniature urns  sort of like lockets if you will  so everybody can get a piece of her  yes its an old custom from thailand   becky loved thai food  so what did i miss  im sorry im late  why werent you at school today  i was in school today i just wasnt in american history  i mean who needs to know that shit anyways right  somebody who wants to have a concept of how the world works  so they can have a fucking chance in life  what crawled up your ass  its all lies anyways  where were you  andy and i skipped out after lunch we went to the car museum  did you get high  im 18 years old living in fucking california im not allowed to get high  im worried about you gabe  in case you dont remember i have good reason to be  im sorry okay  but you dont have to worry about me i swear  just please dont lie to me  im not  im okay  and im gonna stay okay  as long as i have you  lets take a look at your test results  well i have some very good news you tested negative for the hiv antibody  thank god  you need to be tested again in six months just to be safe  lets see negative for chlamydia all hepatitises syphilis  positive for gonorrhea   what  yeah  have you had any pain or difficulty urinating   no  any penile or anal discharge  no  gonorrhea can be completely asymptomatic  but if its left untreated it can lead to severe problems down the line  im gonna give you some cipro it usually knocks it right out  well this is certainly embarrassing  did you engage in unprotected sex  yes  bad boy   how was school  dull and depressing  what are you reading  now that you know  now that you know what  that david is gay  i take it you knew already  how do you feel about it  are you hurt angry   do you wish he wasnt gay  no  those are all valid feelings you know  i dont care if hes gay just as long as hes happy  according to this book  we should all be very open to how we feel  and we should try to express those feelings  because the foundation of intimacy is truth  okay  have you ever had any feelings of samesex attraction  what no mom   its nothing to be ashamed of  i know  when i was your age  i actually had a little crush on jane fonda  shes single again so nows your chance  i just never got into that whole promiscuous thing you know  first guy i had sex with  i ended up in a relationship with for four years  oneman kind of guy always have been what about you  definitely  sex just for the sake of having sex what is that  dont get me wrong i love sex im a very sexual being  i just think its better when theres something emotional going on behind it  i credit my parents for that  my mom and dad have been together for almost 40 years  theyre still hot for each other  and theyve never been anything but 100 supportive of me  wow  i gotta get to work listen its been great meeting you  this was fun would you like to do it again  i dont think so  you seem like a really nice guy but i gotta be honest  i didnt feel much of a spark  cant make it happen if its not there right  it definitely looks like avm  fuck  so now what  well that depends remind me what your symptoms have been   headaches  all the time  no just occasionally mostly on the left side of my head  any seizures impairment of vision sense of smell  once i had a flutter just on the edge of my vision  im as blind as a bat  once i woke up i could see perfectly out of my left eye  lasted for a day and then it went away who knows what the hell that was  so what next  well lets see  its in a not overlyeloquent brain area   you lefthanded  no   thats not good  why not  and its a little larger than id like it to be  yeah its a little larger than id like it to be  okay  you want options ill give you the big three  cranial surgery not a picnic  embolization  closing off the blood vessels by injecting glue into them  sometimes we use platinum coils instead  and finally radial surgery  focused radiation  die you little motherfucker  if id never been in a car accident and gotten a routine xray of my skull  this wouldve never even come up right  until something happened  its possible that i could go my entire life without it ever creating a problem   anythings possible  do you think i need surgery  i cant really say without more tests  i think you might benefit from embolization  however anytime you close off the large arteries going into an avm  the smaller blood vessels feeding it tend to increase in size  okay so it doesnt really work   theres only so much we can do  oh god  fuck fine you know what just dont do anything okay  im going to put this all out of my head no pun intended and just get on with life  im not sure  i dont give a fuck what you think you arrogant piece of shit  okay even if we decide not to do anything at this juncture  theres no we i decide  id still like to get another mri on you in 12 months  and id like a fucking straight answer asshole  its kind of ironic  you dont smoke you run every day eat all that healthy crap  shut up  now me i smoked i drank i ate any old thing i wanted  and i inhaled embalming fluid for god knows how long you know what  if it wasnt for that bus id have lived to be 93  its the first time ive driven since then you may want to fasten your seatbelt  well whos the dead man in this car its not me  fuck you  we thank you heavenly father  for this and all thy blessings in christs name amen  amen  ive invited nikolai to dinner sunday night id like you all to be there  nikolai the flower guy  yes he and i are having a sexual relationship now  im not sure if its something thats going to last but there it is  were all adults were all sexual beings we should acknowledge that  okay  nate id like you to invite brenda claire id like you to invite gabriel dimas  and david if you have a special friend id like for him to come as well  why is my friend special  all right if youre having sex with anyone id like to meet him is that better  not really  stop acting like children   where are you going  im just getting an aspirin  do you have a headache  no i read you should take an aspirin a day it keeps the blood thin  please if our blood were any thinner wed evaporate  whats that supposed to mean is that some sort of insult were thinblooded  mom no it was a joke im more thinblooded than any of us probably  are you seeing anyone  no  why not  sex is an important and healthy part of life its nothing to be ashamed of  yes i know that unfortunately im not having any right now  what happened to that cop  the black man  he met someone else  thank you  you dont have any free time tomorrow   i dont think so  id really like to see you  i have three shiatsu appointments  youre the one that wanted me to get on with my life  you can still come sunday night for dinner right  even if just for the entertainment value its bound to be a freak fest  i think so maybe   i miss you  you just saw me  i know i just  would really like to be with you at this moment in time   right now  ill see you soon  sunday okay  i love you  i love you too   hey rico  hey boss man ive got a favor to ask you  okay  could you please drop her off at the crematorium for me tonight  come on man vanessas just a bit overwhelmed at home  julios got a cold and augusto hasnt slept through the night for a month  no i cant  im sorry rico but i cant  okay  can you at least help me put her inside the box  sure  so cardboard box classy  she obviously didnt think her life was worth anything so it makes sense to me  on three one two three  its kind of sad  its not  she threw her fucking life away its not sad its pathetic  we tend to forget how many gifts god has given each and every one of us  because our lives are so filled with distractions  crowded with messages competing for our attention  encouraging us to be unhappy with our lives  if only we looked younger  had perfect skin  zero body fat  the truth of the matter is god loves us just the way we are  some people said congratulations youve really
