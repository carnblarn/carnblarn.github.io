yeah  oh god   you swear she didnt hold her  yes i swear  would it have mattered if she did  do you care about me at all  you and maya are the most important things in my life  dont let your old girlfriends hold our baby   i didnt so whats the problem  its not that complicated nate  anyone who knows other people exist would have figured it out  you think im still in love with brenda im not   you went to her fathers funeral  after checking with you you said it was ok  why do you spend time with her why cant you let her go   whatever brenda and i had its over  bullshit  it doesnt take

fathers goddamn ashes  well it is kind of traditional  i cant face that not yet  you dont have to hes in no hurry  you know youve never felt so much like my children before  having your father around

it but me  dear carl and cameron greetings from cousin arthur  a babysitting opportunity passed me by today  and left me thinking of you two fellows  i hope youre enjoying spreading the gospel in kansas city  my internship is coming along swimmingly  theres a dear charming woman here at the funeral home  who is very kind and attentive  well i suppose thats all there is  ps keeping in touch
