were going to try to fix that  antidepressants arent magic bullets  nate  david told me about lisa  please make yourself comfortable ill be right with you  yes and  according to statistics compiled by the us census bureau  women are three times less likely to die from misadventure as men  i find statistics to be comforting in times of stress and uncertainty  ive got an intake right now  i was wondering may i join you  you know me im always hungry for new learning experiences  sure why not  we have been robbed before three times in ten years  dorothy wanted for us to retire but i just kept putting it off  maybe next year maybe the year after that  and now shes taken away from me  how can she not be here  one minute shes there the next shes gone like she was never there  at least shes no longer suffering   she had cancer right  no she was shot in a holdup  i am so sorry  what kind of interment were you interested in  we have a plot at forest lawn  i see  would you like to look at our line of caskets  i dont have much money  im sure we can find something to accommodate your budget  right nate   absolutely  thank you  absolutely  he was electrocuted i dont want my children to see him like that   we have an excellent restorative artist  no  i dont want my children to see him dead   if youll excuse me for just a moment  sure   what do you mean missing  she was on her way to her sisters   she never got there  oh man  i still have a couple of contacts with the sheriffs department  do you want me to make some calls  nates already talked to them they filed a missing persons report  if you think you can find anything else out sure why not  we need to talk about us  i know and we will but not right now  i have a woman waiting for me in the pastoral room  ok  ill make some calls ill get back to you if i hear anything  thanks   this is so day of the locust  no locusts here  cockroaches maybe but no locusts  here we are  now that there is a sleeper sofa  they come in very handy when you have overnight guests  like family that sort of thing  you do have family dont you  no actually they were all killed in a flood   honey im sorry  dont be  ill be honest with you we do have the occasional breakin every once in a while  if i were you i would sleep with a can of pepper spray under my pillow  just in case   smells like cats  we dont allow pets   we used to but not any more  how much  and two weeks security deposit  ill take it   what are you doing here  i made this for you  russell  claire i just want you to know  that what happened between olivier and me was totally fucked up  what happened between you and me wasnt fucked up at all  it was the opposite of fucked up   what did happen between you and olivier  it doesnt matter   it matters to me did you fuck him  what we did or didnt do isnt important  whats important is that i love you   did he fuck you  i was drunk and stoned  and he was playing this head trip on me you know what hes like  did you give each other blow jobs   claire i love you  jesus you gave each other blow jobs   i didnt say that  jerk each other off   i didnt say that  what are you saying  that i love you ok  why cant you hear that  when are you gonna get over your wounded pride for one second  and realise what we have is too good for you to throw away  for me to throw away thats funny youre funny  and thats hideous i dont want it  maybe you can sell it to your fucking boyfriend for another 500 im sure you were worth it   i dont wanna live without you  youre gonna have to   im not gonna give up  thats your fucking problem   hello  hello brenda   hi mom  i heard you freaked out on billy  you really shouldnt do that hes on medication  you know how sensitive he is  is there any other reason you called if this is it im hanging up  well were disposing of your fathers ashes tomorrow  i thought you might wanna be there  i really dont wanna be round billy right now  darling we owe it to your father  dads dead he doesnt care  well i care ok id like to at least pretend that we all love each other  and that your father and i created something worthwhile  for a fucking hour however long it takes to dump his ashes  is that too much to ask   have you decided where  no not yet  were all meeting here around 1130 the whole ordealll be done by two   fine ill be there  ok bye  give yourself the grade you think you deserve  is that paying me to keep my mouth shut  im letting every student give their own grade   who am i to judge anyones work  oh god youre ridiculous  you contradict yourself so nothing ever means anything  is meaning what youre really after  your work this semester would suggest otherwise  your technique is excellent but thats all it istechnique  your work is safe limited  cos you hold yourself back from life  well call me crazy but i think an artist has a responsibility  to do more than just give in to every emotional impulse  because some impulses are wrong  and some impulses violate the regulations of this school i checked  exactly how many schools have you taught at  you sit in such judgement of the world how do you expect to ever be a part of it  i dont wanna be part of your world a manipulative loser who fucks his students  what do you wanna be an uptight puritan whos not even in her own body  or a brilliant artist with blood and a heart and a cunt  god youre such a fucking phoney  at first you actually inspired me  it took me half a semester to realise you were using us  to work through your own shit  when are you gonna get over the fact that you never became picasso and now its too late  when are you going to get over the fact that if you take a chance you might fall on your face  but thats the best thing that can ever happen to you  as an artist and as a human being   are we done  absolutely get out of my office  who do you think you are the pope just because i fucked your boyfriend  what a baby you need some real pain   fuck you  fuck yourself  russell will always be a better artist than you hes braver more willing to take chances  hes certainly more ambitious that seems obvious  if it hadnt been me it would have been somebody else trust me   ill take an a  undeserved  unimportant  i know ive already called ive been call  my wife is still missing and i cant seem to get anyone to take me seriously  yes  i have called the sheriffs department and the highway patrol  i spoke with officer polk  go ahead thank you  yes i know thank you  no i will call back in a few hours   any news  no   im gonna take maya to the park  great  nate dear everything is going to be fine youll see  i made some apple crumble why dont you have a piece  heres the gentleman who passed away at the health club what shall i do with him  put him in the reefer  i believe that the refrigerator is already full  then youll have to leave him out wont you   but that would be a code violation  well just have to take the risk   as long as you both understand that i  youre not responsible we are  perhaps i could just try and make a little more  just stop fucking whining and get the hell out of here already ok  ok   you all right  not especially  is there anything youd like to talk about  you really wanna know or are you just being polite  i asked didnt i  my wife is clinically depressed  on top of that my sisterinlaw who i have problems with on a good day  is at my house taking care of her right now  i dont even wanna think about that  on top of that these electrocution burns are a serious bitch   has anybody heard from lisa yet  not yet no  im sure its only a matter of time  a matter of time before what  before she calls and tells us shes had a little car trouble or  i dont know that shes ok  no one in this family ever talks about whats really going on  what is that supposed to mean  we have to deal with the possibility that something bad has probably happened  we do not you may not believe this but i have a lot more life experience than you  at times like this its important that we keep a positive attitude  why must you always be so negative  why must you always be in such deep denial  i am not in denial  im just trying to prepare for the worst so that when it happens its not so awful  well dont lisa is going to turn up and shes going to be fine  and therell be a logical explanation for all of this  yeah youre right  and theyre gonna put an end to world hunger and peoplell stop killing each other  and the oil companies are gonna stop running everything and apologise for global warming  im sure its just a matter of time  when you talked to her she said she was at the ocean did she say where  no she just said it looked nice   how long had she been gone  two maybe three hours  long enough to switch to highway one at san luis obispo  yeah maybe but probably not shes not the worlds fastest driver   why wouldnt she stay on the 101  she wanted to drive through big sur   she loves big sur  did you contact the credit card company   she may have stopped to get gas right  or lunch or a motel room  any purchases that might indicate the cars been stolen  i should do that right now   hello  hey nate its me brenda  i just wanted to call and apologise for last night it was really unlike me and  look brenda i cant talk to you right now  ive got a lot more important shit to deal with fuck  fucking come on  im already on hold  im gonna get going  im gonna stay here  ok   call you tomorrow  or sooner if you hear anything  when im feeling a little bit shaky  ok so we know that she stopped for gas in santa barbara  but that was yesterday youd think shed use the card again between then and now  unless she had a lot of cash on her  she didnt have a lot of cash on her  at least i dont think she did  i cant talk about this any more  whats going on with you and keith  nothing much  you guys seemed a little tense tonight   you think we were tense  yeah  i guess we are  we had this big fight down in san diego in front of his mom and dad  i butted in maybe i shouldnt have  now i dont know where we are  we love each other at least i think we do  lately though i just feel numb when were together  and better when were not  its not like we dont want the same things we do  i think maybe we dont want the same things maybe were just pretending that we do  maybe were just not meant to be together  artefacts from the near and distant past were emerging from the ice  steven hiller reports on the discovery of archaeological treasure steven  during the short siberian summer our anthropologists discovered  hey sweetie  hi my love  where the fuck have you been  do you know how worried ive been how worried weve all been  i filed a fucking missing persons report on you   oh my

talking about  the new shopping mall   the grove  i dont know why we havent been  theres a dance lesson tonight you feel up to it  i dont know but maybe  if were gonna cancel we should let them know otherwise theyll charge us   can we decide later  call me at work after lunch   ok i will  ok   i need the credit card  what for  im taking her shopping a little shopping is good for depression   youre gonna go shopping  itll be fun  were just gonna get her a new pair of shoes maybe lunch at farmers market   please  of course   here  thank you baby  where did he want his ashes spread  he told me to surprise him   maybe we should take him out to catalina  im pretty sure you need a permit for that  why dont i put him in my backpack and no ones the wiser  are you two not speaking to one another its really starting to annoy me   can we do this then i can go  im speaking  ok whatever but i am not going out to catalina in some goddamn boat  just because you were there once when you were 12   what about the beach in malibu  thats where everyone throws their ashes   so  i dont want him comingling with strangers  we drive him up into angeles national forest and plant a tree  plant a tree you must be kidding   then i say we drive him to malibu  im not going all the way out to malibu  besides the trafficll kill us on the way home  this is giving me such a goddamn headache  fuck it  there now hell be in westwood for all eternity   what  we need your help claire  im kind of in the middle of something right now  hurry it up  what am i supposed to do  give these to people and make sure theyre here to see mrs su   you need help for that  yes  and smile not too much compassionate but not happy  that should be no problem   mrs su  mr tully  hes in there  whats up with you  nothings up with me am i not allowed to be in a bad mood  if thats what you want  my boyfriend had sex with another guy and we broke up are you happy   im so sorry  what is it with you people  you cant figure out what you are so youve gotta string along girls to ease the transition  mrs su or mr tully  mrs su please  right through here  its probably best you found out about russell now before it went any further  the timing of all this is just so fucking perfect its not even funny  what do you mean  with whats going on with lisa  and how terrible things always happen at the same time  like when those celebrities die in sets of three  mrs su right this way   you dont think lisa might have  what offed herself no way  things seemed pretty tense between her and nate for a while there  she had that weird look in her eye like it wouldnt take much to send her over the edge  theres no way lisa would do anything like that not with the baby   how are we doing  so far so good  weve only got about half an hour an hour tops to get the sus out of the pastoral room  so we can get mr monroe in there   goodness were not gonna make it  of course we will  we dont have a choice  you must be here for edward tully  no im here for dorothy su   am i in the wrong place  over there  i parked on the street right in front im not going to get a ticket there am i   you should be fine  thank you   he could get a ticket  itll take too long to move it  when were in the weeds the way we are today you gotta move em in and out  you dont understand this is my wifes car  she didnt just leave it here and disappear  theres her cellphone her wallet and her overnight bag but her backpacks missing   you checked the trunk  its not in there  and also lisa doesnt drink dr pepper  she doesnt drink soda at all she thinks its toxic   im sorry mr  fisher  weve got a missing persons report on file  a missing backpack and a can of dr pepper is not evidence of foul play  without evidence of foul play we cant treat this as anything more than it appears to be   a missing persons case  im not gonna pretend theres nothing to worry about possibly there is   my wife is fucking missing  i can see that you are genuinely distressed  but at this point there isnt a whole lot i can do  if it were me id stick around the area in case she finds her way back to pick up her car  theres a motel just up the way  i would make sure to move it by this time tomorrow  unless you want it towed to the impound lot  god how long is she gonna go on like this  with any luck shell throw herself over the railing  tell roberta flack i couldnt take it any more   we have to talk  no we dont  what is there to say   im in love with you  jesus dont  i need to say it i need to say it  i know i cant have you  i know its wrong to want you like this  but that doesnt make it any less true   and what am i supposed to do with that  nothing  i have to let it go  and maybe saying the words will help  i want to let it go  you have to believe that  i just have a feeling about this and everything is going to be all right   ive always been right about my feelings  mom they found her car  there are a hundred explanations for that she could have run out of gas  she has a triple a card a cellphone she would have called   maybe the battery went dead  i just want you to be prepared  i am sick of hearing that i will not be prepared and neither should anyone else  i refuse to believe that anything is wrong  i have to trust my feelings  right now theyre all i have  just where do you think you are going  to relax in my study with a nice cup of tea my succulent compote  you may have some tea later after you find those rats   what the hell is all of this  what  the tv a refrigerator  the delivery guys couldnt get the refrigerator through the door  you have to take out those old cabinets first  oh my god  oh my god ok julio  come on get your brother lets go in the other room   wheres vanessa  shes asleep   we have a dance lesson tonight  wake her up if you want to  but if i were you i would let her sleep  you told me you were taking her shopping for a new pair of shoes   dont start with me  we cannot afford

other   she knew youd be pissed  i am pissed  she takes care of your kids every single day  and works a fulltime job on top of that  look at this place no wonder shes depressed  so she bought a new tv and a new refrigerator  they were both on sale give her a fucking break  she deserves it   may i help you  thank you  i was here earlier today for dorothy sus funeral  i think i may have left my
