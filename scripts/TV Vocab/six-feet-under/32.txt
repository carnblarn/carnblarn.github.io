 the coroner said she died from a nose bleed  thats whacked losing that much blood through your nose  not as uncommon as you might think  your dad and i had a couple of these back in the day  she was probably born with a deviated septum and at some point they fixed it  yeah and they gave her a cute little nose while they were at it  that could be a nose job  sometimes plastic surgery creates this scar tissue  which can end up choking a major artery until it just explodes one day  jesus were all just walking time bombs  you can pop her in the reefer for now  my large friends gonna need both

its about a botanist whos marooned on a space freighter  his only companions are three little robots that look like tv sets  he names them huey dewey and louie   they play poker with him  they sound adorable  oh they are  quite lovable indeed  and yet benign  obedient  much like television itself  perhaps the writers comment on how technology can be controlled  and used effectively for humankind  perhaps not  starring bruce dern   with music by joan baez  i used to love listening to her  ah well ill see it another time   you need more coffee  no i just filled it  of course you did  russell this is gonna look hot hot hot baby  claire i did blue hair in eighth grade  that was sincere blue hair this is a comment on blue hair  maybe it was more magenta maybe this is my first blue hair   tinfoil thingy  yeah  youre taking it from the same place as the other side so its even  if its too even it looks like youre trying too hard  if its haphazard its more like fuck you  just not too uneven  oh good the enter without knocking sign is clearly legible  im only here because rico said you took some of my brushes without asking   russell this is my brother david  hi  hey  im sorry im

round a campfire   you told me to bring my weed  if you have weed why do you need beer  sighs  maybe because i like to unwind and kick back  and forget that i spend my days surrounded by death  all i

everything  uu it stands for unitarian universalist  but its about as not religious as a religion can be  that would be nice  not a place that preaches but one where we can be with people like us  no big god no crosses or dripping blood or shit exactly  just people getting together  anyone wanna catch a buzz shall i go get my bullet   sure  yeah go ahead  all right  how often does jesus come up

relationship of my life  ours is more like we cant keep our hands off each other  she just loves to bang  sometimes i feel when were having sex he secretly hates me  thats not possible  not conscious not like he knows it on any level  i know its stupid but i really feel like that sometimes  it is stupid because youre a beautiful woman and the mother of his child  so why would he hate you  i know its crazy but sometimes its like theres this unspoken thing between us   unspoken what  i dont know  yeah im the mother of his child so he has to madonnafy me  maybe im just mad at the whole world because my orgasm thing is screwed up   since you had maya  youve heard of this  something is different it freaks me out  it took me a couple of months to be able to come after spencer was born  i can
