                trash as in trailer trash  theyre 20 minutes late with my vioxx again  im in such pain  im in such agony  i wish the good lord would take me soon  how are things at home with you and rico he still acting crazy  i dont know but he definitely has a bug up his ass  midlife crisis  hes too young for that  honey men start having their midlife crisis in their early 20s  and they keep on having them every three to five years after that  youre gonna have to eat more than this mrs kippleman   shit  now what  vanessa shes got no pulse  shit   shes a full code  i dont know  come on edith come on  a worldclass complainer like you isnt gonna give up that easy   how about these  the green pants   actually these are olive  i can get myself dressed you know  im just trying to help   did i ask for your help  no  then what the hell are you doing in my room  hey you dont talk to david that way  youd better start showing some respect around here   or what youre gonna put me in jail  what did you say  let her go  weve got to start setting some serious boundaries with her  look at all the shit shes had to deal with  not to mention the past couple of months shes 9   i know how old she is  im just saying  do you want to pick a fight with me  no do you want to pick a fight with a 9yearold about her attitude  this morning i do  too fucking bad i know youre nervous about your old man coming  but i dont have to let you take it out on taylor or me   its 930  so  let me sleep late  its the last enjoyment ill know before i become a cog in the wheel  making mocha lattes for the people who have a life   dont you think thats a little dramatic  not really   can i make you something to eat  no thanks  you never eat a decent breakfast anymore  this is a glass of orange juice this is an apple  thats two of my daily servings of fruit recommended by the usda  claire are you depressed  im not even gonna answer that question  whatever youre going through i hope you dont blame me  i was just calling you  what you can be late all you want but im not allowed to be   calm down  why im pissed off  i get pissed off sometimes i have a right to express it  express it to somebody else because ive got to run  brenda and i have a meeting with rabbi ari   youre thinking of converting  maybe  what im already circumcised   anything i need to be aware of here  i did a pickup this morning at bay breeze  another referral from vanessa  great another chance for rico to act like we owe our entire livelihood to him  hello mr fisher  dave youve got to lighten up man  can i help you   are you nathaniel fisher  no hes deceased  wait a minute thats me im nathaniel fisher jr  consider yourself served   shit  who was that  you remember mrs collins  the waitress who got locked in the walkin overnight  no the wife of the guy who fell off the boat got sliced up by the propeller  yeah the bargain hunter  she wanted to see the body   you didnt  she made me  now shes suing us for emotional distress to the tune of 500000 fuck  theres an ashtray over there somewhere  you should really clean this car out sometime you know  what the fuck is this  its some creepy thing my aunt sarah sent me for my birthday  i dont know what happened usually she has pretty good taste  its filled with some nasty chinese holistic herb shit  newsflash these arent chinese herbs   theyre not  these are shrooms  my aunt sent me mushrooms  whatever you thought you were doing tomorrow plan on blowing it off   whats wrong with today  i have a date with mr schussler   mr schussler the vocational arts teacher  yeah  and you cant fuck for shit when youre on shrooms  marriage is a profound experience that can deeply enrich your life  and even bring you closer to god  but our culture has many misconceptions about it  like marriage will cure ioneliness  or that most of our satisfactions in life should come from our partner  or that good sex means good marriage  and the truth is that marriage is different for different people  so in this and our next five sessions  well talk about what marriage means to you  im curious   have you ever been married  no i havent  but i have counseled many couples in my congregation  both before during and after marriage  one thing i can say without hesitation  is you cant have a good marriage without honesty  yeah  that kind of goes without saying doesnt it  are you completely honest with each other  you dont have to answer that right now  its just something to think about for next week   would you like some cucumber salad  no thank you   i made more than enough  i reading paper  fine  take it go ahead take it  ill be back  like terminator no  what is he did he threaten you  mind your own business woman  can i just say that i think total honesty is not always the best thing  what about privacy  what about trying to maintain the mystery of a relationship  sometimes truth is irrelevant  brenda i did something stupid  im listening  the trip to seattle my friend lisa  i slept with her shes pregnant  i dont even know how to respond to something like this  what do you feel  i dont know what i feel i dont feel anything  i feel numb   when were you planning on telling me  im telling you now  what do you expect me to do with this information  christ nate this whole wedding thing scares the shit out of me  but ive been trying to make myself believe that we could actually  almost done  okay  okay then  how bad is it   your brother showed her the body  yes   it was in pretty bad shape huh  yes  i think shes got a pretty airtight case  i think that you guys are more or less fucked  she made him show her the body  i can certainly argue that point but david she was under duress  and this woman is going to describe in great detail  exactly what she saw when shes up on the stand  on top of that shes hired herself an aggressive law firm  that nobody likes to mess with so i think that we should try to settle  how much money do you guys have   im sorry i was late  where were you  with brenda we were in the middle of something pretty intense  do you know how much trouble we are in because of this lawsuit  i have things ive got to deal with  i have a life too i have a kid now  at least i try to keep it separate from the business  that you seem so hellbent on flushing down the fucking toilet  we are fucked nate  and you fucked us  im afraid my daughters suffering from depression and i dont know what to do  most teenagers suffer from mild depression at one time or another   is that true  true enough  but im pretty familiar with clinical depression   and i dont see claire suffering from that  you dont  look shes the kind of person  that needs her life to be meaningful im sure you know this better than i do  no i dont feel as though i do  and by the way who doesnt need their life to be meaningful  youd be surprised  she has no idea how easy shes had it  do you want to know what you can do to be more supportive of claire  of course thats why im here i think  this is a brochure for lacarts  i think claire should think about going there  its a great school for someone with her creativity   you really dont think shes depressed  i dont   but can i speak candidly  please  i think its possible that you might be  its me im leaving another goddamn message on your voice mail  listen i really need to talk  billy god damn it i need you i really need you  god damn it where the fuck are you  mr charles hey  its good to see you again  you met me when keith brought me down to san diego last   its been over a year ago  i know who you are  hey lucille im sorry im so late i guess i missed dinner huh   i left you a plate in the microwave  thank you   hey youre home  yeah im sorry im so late  did you get my   wheres taylor  brushing her teeth   did she floss first  yes i watched her  listen i put fresh linens on extra blankets in the hall closet  keith your mother and i want to have a word with you   cant it wait until morning  no i dont think it can   i can leave the room if youd like  i dont care if youre here for this or not  keith wed like to take taylor home with us when we go back to san diego   what for a visit  no to live   why  this isnt any of your concern sir   im sorry but i think it is  no david lets hear him out  for one we have a yard big enough for her to play in  well be able to spend more time with her  and well be able to offer her more stability  its whats best for the child and you know it  fine  ari hi  im sorry to just drop in like this so late but i was in the neighborhood  well nearby speaking to somebody whos interested in arranging a funeral   his own actually what do you call that  a preneed  right  so i was wondering if you would be willing to help him  yeah sure just give me his name and number   ill call him first thing tomorrow  okay   are you all right  yeah im great  okay thats bullshit  im coming in and youre gonna offer me something to drink  that is a lot for her to absorb  she already knew about the avm but i just told her about the baby today  you said wed never have a good marriage without honesty   i did say that didnt i  yeah  why do you think you have so much trouble being honest with brenda   i dont think its particular to brenda  with women then   i dont have trouble being honest with you  im a rabbi nate   you dont look like a rabbi  i am a rabbi  unavailable to you not even in your wildest dreams  thats why you dont have trouble being honest with me  theres nothing at stake  how do you feel about becoming a father  i dont know how i feel about it  i certainly never imagined it would happen like this  all of our actions have consequences  we may not even be aware of them but they exist nevertheless  you should consider it a blessing what if you had never known  sorry  just give her some time nate  time right  we got another one from bay breeze thats the fourth one this year  yes im aware of how many referrals your wife sends our way  just making sure you know where the business is coming from   something funny about this one david  funny how  the certificate says the cause of death was congestive heart failure  so old people have their heart quit on them all the time  yeah but shes got these contusions around her neck  old people bruise easily  those probably happened while they were trying to resuscitate her  maybe  what the fuck  a hot dog  you tell me i dont think something this big just happened to go down the wrong way  is it okay if parker spends the night at our house tonight  of course  would you like me to pick you up a frozen pizza and some videos  no i think were good  are you doing something with nikolai tonight  i think hes losing interest in me  hes been spending a lot of time alone lately  he was living here with plastic casts on both legs  and peeing in a bedpan for what six weeks  whats that supposed to mean  just give him some space guys need a lot of space  he doesnt know how to take care of himself and he needs my help  if you say so  im a little confused about this term preneed  its a payment structure that allows you to  make the purchase before you need it i get that  i may be dying im not an idiot  my question is with the choice of the word need  i mean who really needs a funeral anyway  if youre dead you dont need shit  yes the funeral is really for the people you leave behind  to help them come to terms  what if youre not leaving anybody behind  what if your whole fucking life has been one big waste of time for everybody   including yourself  you dont know that  im all for thinning out the human race there are just too many fucking people  anthrax smallpox i say bring it on  youd probably like that huh good for business  maybe i should just leave this information with you and ill come back later  sorry if im being antisocial  sit down  the good rabbi went through all the trouble of setting this up  besides i may not be here tomorrow   you mind if i ask  what i have   pancreatic cancer  im sorry  its one of the worst ones you can get  i did not know that  yeah i should be dead already  so this is just gravy time its extra frosting on the cake  most people last up to maybe six months tops  me ive been hanging in here for over a year  can you fucking believe it  ill bet you never met anybody half as lucky as i am  and you pulled this relatively intact out of the deceaseds airway  thats correct  what made you decide to look in her throat  i would have gone in there anyway to swab her out  before i started embalming her   but i had my suspicions  what made you suspicious  the contusions around her neck  these contusions couldve been made when they tried to resuscitate her  they could have  if they tried to resuscitate why didnt they find the frankfurter stuck in her airway  it was stuck pretty far down  some of these nursing homes arent exactly up to speed on their cpr training  she was brought over from the bay breeze nursing home  thats correct  and who tried to resuscitate her  wait a minute i think i got that  dolores willitts and vanessa dial  diaz vanessa diaz  she is my wife   where is nikolai  hes out on a delivery  tell him i stopped by and i come back later  how much money does nikolai owe you   excuse me  how much money does nikolai owe you   who are you  im his friend   his lady friend  thats right  it is none of your concern  tell me how much he owes you and ill pay you the money   you will pay me the money  tell me how much it is  87000  oh my   i had no idea it was that much  you dont have that kind of money do you  as a matter of fact i do   you would do this for nikolai  please im trying to count  nikolais a lucky man  what is your name  ruth fisher  i wouldve taken a check ruth fisher  whos this pretty little girl who wants to join the party  isnt it way past your bedtime honey  brenda honey  mommy and daddy have company and you need to go back up to bed now  margaret youre stigmatizing the situation for her  no im not bern  keith you cannot let them take my baby  karla theyre only as far away as san diego  i think its for the best  there aint no fucking way its for the best are you crazy  daddy didnt even need an excuse to smack the shit out of me or you   and look what that did to us  look what that did to you  i dont want taylor growing up with that shit  but you dont mind her growing up with a mother whos a drug addict  i might be a drug addict but i never hurt my child  thats the way people raised their kids back then  im tired of you blaming everything gone wrong in your life on dad  please you know how the slightest little thing would set him off  i think hes changed  people can change  people dont change they just get older thats all   david fisher how the hell are you  jesus  certainly not in any mood to deal with the likes of you  honey you could stand to work on those manners hi nate  i understand you boys are being sued  so what youve come here to gloat  i just wanted you to know we are paying poor mrs collins legal fees  and honey weve got awfully deep pockets  yall this thing is gonna go on forever  in the end its gonna drag you boys down i can guarantee you that  now we are still willing to buy this little momandpop shop of yours  at a drastically reduced price im afraid  but i think that if youre smart and im betting you are  youll go on and get out while the gettings still halfway good  im curious mitzi what do you get out of this  i like to win honey its the way i was brought up  i hope you dont expect me to apologize for it because im not gonna do it  i dont expect anything from you  but i wonder at the days end when youre alone  staring at yourself in the bathroom mirror  do you really like who you see looking back at you  i love what i see  see i just dont buy that  because if you did you wouldnt be doing this  you know its a crying shame  that someone as cute as you has to be such a goddamn doomandgloomer  you boys think it over and let me know what you decide  personally i think its a nobrainer  but everyones entitled to their own opinion   but i dont have the money  what do you mean   of course you have the money  i dont its all gone   where did it go  thats none of your business  mom we need that money in order to offer mrs collins some kind of settlement  or were seriously screwed  the only time you tell me whats going on in your lives is when you need money  if youd told me about this before the money wouldve been there its gone   you guys this is my friend parker  hi   were just gonna be upstairs  bye  i give up  that was weird that was totally weird are they always like that  always  my god your room is so beautiful  we should do something what do you want to do  i dont know what do

thank you for seeing me mrs collins  i just want to apologize for the unfortunate incident  that brings us to this unpleasant juncture  my brother is new to this business  he didnt know what he was doing  when he showed you your husbands remains  thats not my problem is it  no of course not  you were vulnerable when you asked him to do this  and he shouldnt have but nevertheless you did ask him  whats your point   whats my point  yeah  do you even have one  you know its not my fault or my brothers  that you allowed your husband to smack you around all those years   thats your problem  youve no right to talk about my marriage  you chose to be a doormat or a punching bag  or whatever metaphor for victimhood youre comfortable with  you stayed in an abusive marriage  and wasted god knows how many years of your life  years youll never get back and that makes you furious doesnt it  youve probably spent your entire miserable life  blaming other people for all the mistakes youve made  now you want us to pay for that  jesus lady just how fucking low are you willing to sink  this lawsuit of yours is gonna cost my family our business  thats my point  there are you happy  now get out  get the fuck out of my house  can you spare a joint  i love haltertops  are you looking at my tits  im talking to you yeah you  are you looking at my tits  my god i wish i couldve lived during the renaissance

beautiful  i love you too  you dont know my dad david  hes like a pit bull when he gets his jaw locked on something believe me  what happened to the keith who fights for something he believes in   for something we both believe in  this isnt that simple  are you taking his side cause looking after taylor is too big a commitment  no im taking his side because for once i think hes right  you know what i think  i think youre not sure that two gay men should raise a child   thats your shit  then why arent we fighting for her  because they have more time to spend with her  please your father plays golf all day and your mom plays with her  for halfanhour tops then pops in a video and gets on the phone  i am not ambivalent about wanting kids  then youre ambivalent about wanting kids with me  of course not i just want to be ready  life doesnt work that way it just dumps things in your lap  and then you try to make the best of it  im tired of talking about this  you know what this is really about youre afraid of him  fuck you  as much as i hate you treating me like a doormat  its even worse seeing your father treat you like one   you think i treat you like a doormat  sometimes  why dont
