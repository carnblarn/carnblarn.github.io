guilty for wasting two years of her life  every woman needs to fall in love with a gay man  its a female rite of passage what about claire and whatshisface  dont tell her i told you about that im serious  just like every gay man needs a period where he tries to be straight  i dont think thats a requirement now we were the last generation that did that  what about claire and whatshisface   so

person you meet  nor do i expect you to come out to every client  whether its celeste or cameron diaz or lan fucking mckellen   but the people you work with  calm down  im not the enemy im your lover

nate are you doing ok  yeah you know  it comes and goes  i can appreciate the attempt but  i think it looks like something youd see on a calendar  like in some bargain bin somewhere   three months after the new year  can you be a little more harsh  no its obviously a stylish calendar in an upscale store  ok so this piece is no good lets move on  i think the question is not so much is this piece good  i would rather we ask is this piece successful  well this is america successful equals good  successful in achieving its intention  anita what was your intent with this piece  i dont know  i liked the way the light was hitting her head  do we have to know exactly what every piece means  no but surely it means something to you  or you wouldnt have brought it in  i cant believe this  i thought arthur was merely eccentric not seriously disturbed  kinda brings new meaning to the term dump truck huh  stop marking it sammy  sloppy you guys blow  hey over there  how many of those guys you think she fucked  them faggots are too busy fucking each other   to ever work her in  right  yo k whats up you coming on the road with us next month  im still waiting to hear  johnny you suck

not good  that is so motherfuckin not good  see if you can at least get some free clothes out of it  these two great black balls of male erotic fury  go to explode on one another  thats when everything started  from those cave paintings the creation of the idea of image  of the representation of ourselves  and thats when we stopped living inside nature  and started living inside our heads  yeah which is why we can just sit back and watch  while greedy corporate bushsuckers destroy nature   since were no longer a part of it  if you take humans out of nature  then all theyre left with is human nature  ok that sounds good but what the fuck does that mean  thats no doubt his new assistant  i heard you fucked him  no i did not fuck him  so why were you so mean during my crit you bitch

arrest is what kills em  but their insides get fried wherever the current goes  in this case his right arm and left leg hence the separate embalming  so he becomes sort of a human fulgurite as it were

you make me sick  i hate that youre gay  i fucking hate it  you dont hate that im gay you hate that i lied to you  you should hate that  i lied to myself too  are you sure you like it  how could i not like the first piece of furniture we purchased as a couple  itll be nice to have a place to display my rock collection  i spoke to a lawyer today about pressing charges against arthur  oh shit  look ruth arthur never sent us any excrement  then who did  my son that toy truck was something i bought him  the only thing i ever bought him actually before he was even born   brian  kyle  i thought your sons name was brian  i have another son  why have you never told me this  because hes never been part of my life  if hes sending us shit in the mail hes a part of your life  no he isnt i was very young his mother and i never even married  her family didnt think i was suitable   so you just left  he wasnt born yet  i was very young  nobody wanted me to be part of his life  are there other wives youve neglected to tell me about  no of course not  art is just a sentimental construct to alleviate our fear of death  no theres no way to even determine what makes art art  much less to teach it  its an illusion that anyone can be taught anything  i mean yes we can all be conditioned up the wazoo  but to really learn something something important  that always comes from within  the cunt has spoken  now the world sits in silence  so why do you teach art then  why  because i need the goddamn paycheck  no you dont baby bern left me very well taken care of  all you have to do is keep making paintings  and ill keep buying them  did you know olivier taught my son   no  im hot for teachers  drink more mom  darling try the shiraz its delicious  no im good  i read in the paper about a student who allowed  some corporation to tattoo its logo on his forehead  and in exchange they paid for his education  what the hell is that  i imagine its an education for someone who wouldnt be able to pay for it himself  its way more than that  my students are all in such a mad rush to become commodities  but thats always been true of artists  where is your bathroom  straight through there to the left  its him  hes the one i can feel it hes the one  youre drunk  now isnt it nice to have someone whos not only great in bed  but whos also your intellectual equal  dont fuck it up this time like you always do  what if shes really not dead   nate they identified her teeth  yeah i know  but what if by some amazing coincidence  somebody had the exact same work done as lisa  i suppose that could be possible   but i think the chances are remote  but it could be possible right   are you high  no im not not any more  maybe you should just like stay in tonight and try to chill out ok  ive got to go  ive got a date with the matthew barney of lac arts  even though im so not the bjrk of lac arts  all the chicks are hatched and fluffy now  listen to them cheep cheep cheep  make the chick sound  hi baby i made some asopao are you hungry  damn i had a sandwich at work  where are the kids  gustos in bed julios spending the night at charlies house  i love you vanessa  i know that  tell me what youd like  i like you  no tell me what you like me to do  just do whatever you want  and ill let you know how it works out for me  why wont you tell me  look  i dont have like a checklist i need to go through   like to have your nipples played with  not if we have to talk about it  how else am i supposed to know what to do  are you telling me you dont  ok maybe we should just go to the movie  maybe i should just go home  all right  youre never gonna learn anything sweetie not in that programme  how could you learn about counselling in 18 months  well after a lifetime of learning how not to do things  maybe im a little ahead of the game  i just still cant believe youre planning on becoming a shrink  the irony  its superb  the real irony is that shrinks are who we hire  to straighten out our lives  but invariably theyre the ones who are the most fucked up  i mean twisted demonic  then it makes absolute sense that brenda would become one  honey come on now a good shrink needs a sense of humour   are you a good shrink  i think im a very good shrink   does that mean youre fucked up  absofuckinglutely  you have no idea  darling do you ever hear from nate  yeah actually we saw him last night  hes still grieving  he showed us pictures of his daughter my god shes so beautiful  those eyes so open and trusting  its mindboggling to think that we were all like that once  i get it  now this makes sense  you want a baby  where did that come from  you are getting a little long in the tooth you know  this would be the time brendas feeling eggy  ok well its time for us to go   nice meeting you  nice meeting you jim  i hope youre up for the challenge of my daughter  i am i am   its joe not jim  bye see you in a few years  terrible evening  what  what time is it  time for you to stop keeping things from me  it sounds absurd when you talk like that  ok  i was just a grad student  and i  accidentally knocked up a young woman from a very wealthy family  i offered to marry her  her family was dead set against it  so i signed something  and we both went on with our lives  what was i supposed to do  youve never even seen this child  yeah ive seen him  he tracked me down a couple of years ago  he was living in some motel over in burbank  and  i didnt particularly care for him  as a matter of fact i found him very unpleasant  and i assumed he never wanted to see me again  why  because he said i dont ever want to see you again  where are you going  im going to the bathroom  george how can you i just dont see how   i feel like i dont know you at all  ruth please  dont blow this all out of proportion  its not good for either one of us   hello  nate   barb  its lisa   where are you  i dont know they wont tell me  who wont tell you  nate the number three is not important  wait what  you buried me how could you bury me   i thought thats what you wanted  but im not dead  its not healthy being so disconnected from your own son  thats why i called him and told him to expect us shortly past noon  his number was in your address book   you looked without asking me  some shred of paternal feeling in you  this is important to me i do not ask you for many things  all right   you look terrible  i feel terrible  im worried about you youre not taking care of yourself  im doing the best i can mom  you pointing out the ways im failing doesnt help  ill be waiting for you in the car  nate can i ask you something  now may not be the best time george  has your mother always been so  anxious about everything  pretty much  shes gotten a lot better since you two got married  howd you deal with her  i moved away when i was 17  for none of us liveth to himself  and no man dieth to himself  for if we live we live unto the lord  and if we die we die unto the lord  whether we live therefore or die  we are the lords  blessed be the dead who die in the lord  even so sayeth the spirit for they rest from their labours   the lord be with you  what  thats not a very nice way to answer the phone  this is starting to get weird ok you are not my wife  i know that  i do not want you calling me all the time  of course im sorry  i didnt think that i  i dont ever wanna be a problem for you  george i have a question for you  and i want you to answer me honestly  ruth i get the feeling you think i havent been honest with you  but i always have  i just dont want to burden you with things that dont matter  thats what i would want from you  what did you want to ask me  i have no idea   we just wanted to thank you  of course  seriously man thanks  jen told me how she unleashed on you  i think she really needed to do that  shes been doing it to me mostly  which was making it harder for him to be there for me  yes thats a scenario im familiar with  the funeral was awesome the old guy would have really liked it   ok ill go get the car  ok thanks hon  im sorry  i said some terrible things about you   most of which were true  no david  i know it was hard for you probably harder than it was for me  youre doing it again making it easy for me   some things never change  yeah well some things need to  so why didnt you just tell him what you wanted  cos there was absolutely no way  i mean it would just be too  seriously you would do that   of course  yeah  theyll never figure it out for themselves  no matter how much porn star screaming i do  i just wish they knew how to do it on their own   its so embarrassing  well thats why girls are better  they know  no thanks i love you but im not into eating pussy ok  i tried it once it wasnot for me  ill just have to keep telling stupid guys point blank   lick my clit while you finger me  my god  but ok  last year i went out with this guy phil  he was so hot and he was like so totally into sex  i mean we were alwaysfucking i mean like always  but every time he would you know go down on me  it was like there was this unspoken time limit  i knew that just when it was starting to get good for me  he was gonna look up at me with these lobster eyes  like can i come up now  so what makes you come  i dont know the usual stuff  why are we talking about this  maybe youve never had an orgasm  of course ive had an orgasm  because if you had you wouldnt be embarrassed  about asking for more tongue time  could i have really never had an orgasm  well ive definitely felt a surge of desire  and then you know a sort of relief of that desire  my god claire have you never even rubbed one out   you dont masturbate  i dont find it that interesting  you know claire  we could show you how to give yourself an orgasm  right now if you want  hello not lesbians  i dont think its possible that ive never had an orgasm  well if you havent  youre seriously missing out  id like to say george has told me a lot about you  but he really hasnt told me anything  thats because he doesnt know anything about me  i know you blame me for everything you dont like about your life  why is he here   this was your idea  well  of course it was her idea  you made it clear you never wanted to see me again  i didnt thanks  kyle look we cant change the past  but maybe we can start fresh if youre willing  you cant walk in here and start saying this is this and that is that like youre god  because you know what youre not god youre not even close  i want all deliveries of excrement to our house to cease  yeah well i want world peace  but i dont see that happening either  why are you so angry at me  its your mother you should be angry at and your grandparents  what is it you find my shit offensive  no i find it childish and hostile  and im completely baffled at the timing   i mean why now  because my therapist says  i need to express my true feelings to you  this is a goddamn waste of time  george please are you all right kyle   do you need anything  like what  i dont know clothing underwear socks  no  would you like a cappuccino from my 7500 espresso machine  which i bought so i never have to leave this room  because im so fucking twisted thanks to you know who  thank you yes id love a cappuccino  i was kidding i dont know how to work it yet  well we could all go to starbucks  i feel so sharon stone  do people still do these things when theyve had kids  yeah some people do  and some people dont  i once walked in on my parents  my father was rubbing a rolling pin over my mothers breasts  is that something youd like for me to do for you  no thank you  but i mean that fucked me up more  than if theyd just been fucking in front of us  which they also did by the way  im sorry   that was fun  no it wasnt  kyle deliberately spilled his frappuccino over me  no it was just that he was so nervous being out in the world  my heart goes out to him he lives in a motel  only because hes too damn lazy to change his own sheets  ruth his mothers family comes from major money old old money  he doesnt need us  children need more from their parents than money  its unfortunate that i was cut out of his life  but the fact remains i was cut out of his life  and thats not gonna change  he seemed so lonely  maybe we should invite him to dinner  yeah sure why not  hey how was the funeral  it was  awesome the old guy would have liked it  whats this  that thats the rock  i would definitely tap that ass  im still not out at work  yeah so  you were kinda pushing me to come out  i dont care about that any more its boring  and id rather not fight  ok  did you have fun huh did you have fun  she had a blast  i can really see lisa in her nate  yeah  listen barb i need to tell you something i  i went to a psychic  was that helpful  she said lisas still alive  jesus christ  i dont believe this whats wrong with you nate  do you need help because if you do you should get it  and not from a fucking psychic  i want to have kids too  or just one or or several  and i want to have them  it  with you  i mean i never really  saw myself as or  i never really thought it was possible  but somehow ever since weve met  everything seems  english
