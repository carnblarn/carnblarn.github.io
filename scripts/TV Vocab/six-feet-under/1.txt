unsightly wounds a breeze  ma you remember that stuffed dog i used to have  i dragged it around until its ears fell off then you made new ears out of a towel  i hated that dog after that and i threw it up on the roof  no  i wanted it back and begged dad to get it but he said no  if i really wanted it id never have thrown it in the first place  your father did so many wonderful things for you and

new bookkeeping system thats what youre good at  you never really had any aptitude for this stuff  i know and what did i do with my life  i went to school to learn exactly how to do this stuff  other kids my age were going to frat parties i was draining corpses  and refashioning severed ears out of wax  thank god i didnt lose an ear i can only imagine what youd do with that  and i did it all for

of this family  id trade places with you in a heartbeat  at least you got out of here  i live in a shitty apartment which was supposed to be temporary  i work at a job also supposed to be temporary

floss daily ive had four root canals  im 35 ive had four root canals  im gonna be a loser who ends up in his deathbed saying   whered my life go  no you wont  youll be saying where the hells the morphine  im just trying to cheer you up  ive spent my whole fucking life being cheerful  im sorry about your father but hes in a much better place now  you are so right about that  who the hell is

yeah i know shirley i remember shirley   really  yes  i was the person who sewed her ear back on that was me thats my work  what shes sad so he has to get her out of sight  they always do that  the second someone starts to lose it they take them off into that room  it makes the other people uncomfortable i guess  this is not about the other people  volume  when i went backpacking through europe after i quit school  i went to this island off the coast of sicily  it was this volcanic island  and on the boat over there was this pine box  somebody from the island being returned to be buried there  and there are all these old sicilians dressed up all in black   waiting lined up on the beach  and when they got that coffin to the beach   those old sicilian women went apeshit screaming throwing themselves on it   beating their chests tearing at their hair making animal noises  it was just so  so real  i mean id been around funerals my entire life   but i had never seen such grief  and at the time it gave me the creeps  but now i think its probably so much more healthy than  this  that cop is hot   oh david david  i know mom  its going to be okay it just takes time   ive done a terrible terrible thing  what  ive done a terrible thing   hows she doing  shes fine  im not fine im a whore i was unfaithful to your father for years  and now he knows he knows  i met a man at church once when your father didnt come with me   mom  and he invited me for coffee  and he said he liked my hair  hes a hairdresser a widower  well they divorced before she died so technically i guess hes divorced  he invited me to accompany him on a hike  this is really not the time   maybe she needs to get this out  i dont want to hear it  i used to love hiking when i was younger and being outdoors  i always wanted to take you kids camping  but your father would never leave the business  well i can tell you i went camping with this man from church several times  told your father i was visiting my sister  if hed ever thought to call  can you even begin to fathom the impropriety of this  your husband is lying in a casket  david shes griefstricken okay fuck propriety  we dont say that word  did

playing mr sensitive with her  while her dead husband lies in the next room its disgusting   breathe youre gonna get through this  oh i know  ill be the strong stable dependable one because thats what i do  everyone around me will fall apart because thats what they do  dont you get exhausted being so hard on everyone and yourself  oh shut up   she met him at church  you met me at church  hands  i didnt even realize how lonely i was  or how long it had been since a man touched me like that  well loneliness is a terrible thing  im still a woman you know  yes i know  and now your father sees me like god sees me  he knows everything im so ashamed  you didnt do it to hurt anybody  you were lonely im sure dad forgives you   and god doesnt  oh yeah yeah im sure he does too  look its okay  everybody forgives everybody for everything  fuck  if youre looking for the olives honey theyre right here  ashes to ashes and dust to dust   is easy as pie with franklin s new leakproof earth dispenser  say goodbye to soiled fingers forever  only from franklin funeral supplies we put the fun back in funeral  in the midst of life we are in death  of whom may we seek for succor but of thee o lord  who for our sins art justly displeased  thou knowest lord the secrets of our hearts  shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer  but spare us lord most holy o god most mighty  o holy and merciful savior thou most worthy judge eternal  suffer us not at our last hour  through any pains of death to fall from thee  in the sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life  through almighty god we commend our brother  nathaniel samuel fisher  and we commit his body to the ground  he looks like hes salting popcorn  earth to earth ashes to ashes  dust to dust  the lord bless him and keep him  the lord make his face to shine upon him and be gracious unto him  the lord lift up his countenance upon him and give him peace   nate  no  i refuse to sanitize this anymore   this is how its done  yeah well its whacked  what is this stupid saltshaker  what is this hermetically sealed box this phony astroturf around the grave  jesus david its like surgery clean antiseptic business   he was our father  please dont do this  you can pump him full of chemicals you can put makeup on him  and you can prop him up for a nap in the slumber room  but the fact remains that the only father were ever gonna have is gone  forever and that sucks  but its a goddamn part of life and you cant really accept it  without getting your hands dirty  well i do accept it and i intend to honor the old bastard  by letting the world see how fucked up and shitty i feel that hes dead  goddamn it  amen  wait  let her  let us pray  our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name  thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven  give us this day our daily bread forgive us our trespasses  as we forgive those who have trespassed against us  lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil  for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever amen  amen amen  the lord be with you  mom federicos gonna drive you back okay  i just need to go over a few details with nate well be right behind you  put her there mrs f  you have such delicate hands federico like a statue  or an illustration in an antique book  or one of those little ceramic hands they use to display gloves  you want to be the alpha dog nate is that it  coasting toward midlife with nothing to show for it  you wanna come back and be the rock for this family to lean on   fuck you  that is not what im  you want to get your hands dirty you sanctimonious prick  talk to me when youve had to stuff formaldehydesoaked cotton  up your fathers ass so he doesnt leak   jesus  yeah  well im sure you just wouldve tossed him out with the garbage  it may seem weird to you  but there is a reason behind everything that we do here  we provide people with a very important  and sacred service at the darkest time in their lives  because maybe they dont wanna make a spectacle of themselves  because maybe theyd prefer to grieve in private  why  why does it have to be such a secret its nothing to be ashamed of   dave please  you know nothing  nothing  you had a responsibility to this family  and you ran away and left it all for me  dont blame me if youre not living the life you want  that is
