                so i say to this guy i cant do anything unless you give me an order number  and i dont appreciate your taking that tone of voice with me  he says he doesnt have an order number  and i say well you should always write down the order number  then he gets all pissy  says he wants to speak to the person he ordered the astoria floor lamp from  and i say well do you remember his or her  right you know name  and he says of course not  and i say then im sorry i cant help you  he says this isnt the first time he had a problem ordering from us  last christmas he bought a cd holder and it arrived all broken  when we told him send it back  he couldnt because hed thrown away the box it came in  so i say i say boohoo mister aint you got it bad  and he says i wanna talk to your supervisor  and i say of course you can talk to him  but unfortunately his hours are only 830  so now the wifes in jail according to the cousin who arranged the funeral  i bet he was abusing her maybe he had some sick sexual thing he made her do  please stop  and youre wrong all she told the police was that he was boring  thats it thats all she said   the sick part is i understand it  i do too   sometimes im boring  i am too  i should be at both intakes with you this morning  but youll have to do the casket meeting  because im really backed up down here  david maybe we need to think about finding a replacement for rico  why were doing just fine without him its saving money thank you very much  is there something youd like to say about my work  look you do a great job  when it comes to people who had peaceful farewells  but the big reconstructions youre out of your league  i see so those who cant do criticize  weve got a body thats a pageone rewrite  we got two more coming in from that nightclub fire in valencia   how bad was that fire  well this is where they ended up  maybe the families want  open caskets they already put in the requests   ill put an ad in the paper today  its taken care of  ive scheduled some interviews for this afternoon  as you can see from my resume ive had the good fortune to study  under a variety of gifted restorative artists  oh you worked over at hope valley ive known pt for years  look that lawsuit about the unembalmed arm was not my fault  i took the fall for some bitch that was supposed to cover me for leaving early  sometimes i wake up with a feeling of panic  like my hearts gonna beat right out of my chest  you know what im talking about but after i spend a few extra hours in bed  and do my chanting the dark time usually passes  i know it sounds funny but the first time i embalmed someone  it felt like i was coming home  i just knew that this is what i was meant to do  that doesnt sound funny at all  theres something very intimate about it  im the last person on earth who gets to know these people  anyway i guess i take what i do very seriously  well i have no further questions  me neither thanks for coming in angela well be in touch  great  it was very nice to meet you   it was nice to meet you  yeah  okay  ill wait an hour before i call her  we dont wanna look desperate  just find out if she can start tomorrow

fabulous oh billy darling  thanks mom  you cant keep him to yourself all the time  okay no offense but your family is fucked up beyond comprehension  shes completely tanked  i brought someone i hope thats okay   hey nikolai  hello nate how are you   this is brenda  good evening   hello dear  its good to see you mrs fisher   wheres hiram  hes visiting his son in portland  im serious darling this new stuff is really visceral  not at all leftbrained like your father  yeah hey so where is dad  oh honey bern sends his regrets hes just heartsick  unfortunately hes treating one of his patients  whos undergoing a complete psychotic break at the moment  that always seems to happen whenever theres something important in my life  i guess thats just typical bernard im sorry bernard chenowith behavior  pretentious dick  now you just hush  i thought this would be paintings  i could take photographs  that doesnt mean theyd be any good  mrs fisher ive never seen you having this much fun  oh no no no its great  i am having fun just watching you  hey mr seattle coop hippie boy  oh margaret chenowith who are you   ruth fisher  nates mother  that explains why youre looking at me  like i just took a giant dump on your lawn  if i knew you were putting on a show tonight  i wouldve bought tickets for all my friends  goody theres dr feinberg   hi  what is he doing here  i invited him  gareth feinberg the guy who wrote the book  yeah he wrote charlottefuckinglight and dark  hes a fucking evil dead fish of a fucking nazi fuck  darling try not to act so adolescent it only makes you look bad  as opposed to being drunk and slobbering all over my boyfriend  who by the way is completely not interested  isnt this fun  billy billy billy  its quite powerful stuff its its potent  thats a word dr feinberg likes to use a lot  brenda i see a lot of you in these photographs  hello gareth  margaret  does this have a theme  i know you like your things to have a theme  mother nothing is more tedious than when you look for meaning in my work  i dont need your fucking approval  excuse me   isnt that beautiful  yeah it is  hes good  yeah he is really good  i only wish hed believe that  this ones got real attitude   oh my god  the lights spectacular  brenda that is a picture of me urinating on a wall   i realize that  hey what do you think  so now youre stalking me  no i just saw you one day when i was taking pictures  so i followed you  you were just out taking pictures  you live in venice theres no reason for you to be in my neighborhood  you think the world revolves around you  bren would you tell him please this isnt about him  its what billy does  he takes pictures of people when theyre off guard   hes got a talent its art  no its fucked  thanks a lot  look thats your son pissing against a wall  so i should let him humiliate me whenever he wants  oh god nate dont make this about you  why the fuck not this is about me you make enough stuff all about you  so what theres a picture of you pissing on a wall  who got hurt who died  you dont think i have a right to not be spied upon  youre talking to someone who was spied on her whole life  god billy is severely fucked up bren i dont like being stalked by a psycho  billy is not psychotic he has a disease hes fine when he takes his meds  yeah well when the fuck is that  look has he ever done anything weird  yeah hes bipolar his whole life hes been weird  has he ever done anything dangerous  oh god nate no  the only person billy would ever be a threat to is himself   has he ever tried to  yes  when i was 18  i went to europe for three months  it was this big reward for me winning a scholarship to yale  when i got back to la my mother was at the airport  she told me that billy had committed suicide  my whole life just collapsed in on itself in that moment  of course she meant to say that billy had tried to commit suicide  she was drunk or else it was a freudian slip  you never went to yale  billy was in a hospital in pasadena  i took some classes at ucla in the spring  then in the fall he was diagnosed manicdepressive  which kicks in in adolescence  so it probably had nothing to do with me getting the scholarship  i cant believe they pressured you into sacrificing your life for your brother  nobody pressured me  i wanted to stay   morning  morning pee on any walls lately  shut up  so mom whats with you and nikolai  i dont know what youre talking about  and dave whatd you do last night  nothing  saturday night what happened to that  person youre seeing  that person is no longer in the picture  sorry to hear it  what about you   you dating anybody  no  if you are you dont need to hide him from us like were lepers  im not dating anyone ive just been hanging out a lot with somebody  who is this person  nobody  david im ready to go to church  thanks guys   hey joey the kids ready  so am i  this is the most terrifying shower scene since psycho  that football game used to make this obnoxious noise  when you scored a touchdown  do you wanna show me how to play it  no  you know theres this theres this little kid next door  and the only toy hes got  is this stupid mousetrap game from when his mom was a kid  maybe you know hed want some of these  its a beautiful day why would you waste your sunday in here watching tv  what are you doing  i thought that tony rechner next door might want some of these  just keep your hands off them  she doesnt even look me in the eyes anymore  come on i wanna show you something funny come on  come on  were going on a field trip  this is like the first day of school  i am so excited  oh and i just wanna apologize in advance  because i had calamari last night for dinner   what do you mean  lets just say this is one time  where the strong smell of formaldehyde really comes in handy  so then i said i dont care if you have a low sperm count  i mean ill just shove a turkey baster up there if i have to  i mean i wanna have a child before i turn 40 thats fair right  hello everyone  hi how was church nate told me youre a deacon  thats adorable  i see youve made yourself at home  angela doesnt like to feel constrained  well you know my glands go doubletime  i find if i wear too much while i work i get all pitted  angela were sort of used to a more professional appearance around here  give me a break david theyre just nipples  i mean weve all seen them weve all touched them  weve all sucked on them its not like this guy will be lying in the casket  and people will be saying oh my god the embalmers nipples were hard  theyll be saying how did they put his face back together  after he went through the goddamn windshield  i told father jack id help with the food distribution downtown  i just wanted to make sure that your first day was going okay  well thanks im all gassy but thats not your fault  angela had calamari last night  boy hes a barrel of laughs  its hard when a new person comes into a situation  it throws everything off balance  bren i am not threatened by your boyfriend  oh yeah your behavior consistently communicates otherwise  you want the picture out of the show fine  but dont spout psychobabble at me like fucking margaret and bernard   youre like becoming them  fuck you  you know what you did was wrong thats why you didnt show it to me   why are you making it such a big deal  because i love him  youre fucking with my life billy and its not fair  you have to stop   or what  goddamn it billy what is it with you  you like fucking with my brain like feinberg   thank you  youre welcome  can i get you anything else  i can always use a good blowjob  hey do i get my fucking lunch or not   im going to get a drink of water  yeah sure  melinda daner mark whitman  darryl heinz keith charles  okay well just tell them well meet them at the usual corner on tuesday okay   hi tracy  oh hi david   how have you been  fine  i love your new hair  what are you working on  st stephens is sending over some volunteers to help out next week  someone told me that you used to go to st stephens  not that ive been asking around about you it just came up naturally  so did you go there i mean   yeah just for a few months last year  theyre a very progressive church  yes they are  the guy who took these is a total psycho  its good  well we should probably get going if we wanna see that movie  i should probably get home and check on my mom  im sure shes doing fine  im sorry  its not like i was dying to see a movie  thats not what im talking about  im sorry  about what happened between us  i never meant for those assholes to write shit on your car  i shouldnt have told andy about us  i was just being stupid that was me being really really really stupid  and im sorry  well thank you  look i dont wanna make a big deal out of this  all im saying is i sat around last week  in that stupid getup you wanted me to wear  and had to say all this you know daddy this and daddy that bullshit  when i tell you i keep reading articles about having this onehour orgasm  well the least you could do is try to help me have one  im sorry men cant have it  since you guys get everything else on the planet  it seems like a fair tradeoff  fine  goodbye  you know angela my brother likes a certain decorum  when youre working with someones loved one  yeah  well the personal calls are probably a little uncool  oh right got it  i wont do it when hes around  hello  hey  really  why dont you want me to come over  damn it brenda you always do this youre shutting me out  look the pissing thing is no longer an issue i swear  look maybe youd feel better if i came over  all right fine whatever fine   girlfriend trouble  not really trouble  tell me what the fight was about and ill tell you what to say to fix it  i mean trust me this is my thing  we didnt have a fight  she just pulls away from me at the weirdest times  well maybe she senses that youre pulling away  so she just does it first  maybe you should mind your own business  shoot i guess this means i cant ask about the pissing  because i had an ex who wanted to pee on me and i wasnt grossed out  i mean i just thought it was kind of silly but thats me  thank you for taking me to the art gallery last night  i thought you hated those pictures  no no its just that i dont like them thats all  but it was nice to be spending time with you  i mean outside of working together  would you like to go to dinner sometime   is that like a date  of course not  good i pick you up tomorrow night 800  i dont wanna go okay just stop asking me  okay fine i was only inviting you to be nice  nobody even wants you there because youve been acting so weird lately  gabe   we have to be someplace  get lost morticia  shut up peanuttesticle  fuck off the both of you  whats his problem  nothing he wants me to go to this party tomorrow im just not in the mood  we can do something if you want  actually i gotta go to barstow tomorrow and spend the night at my dads  i gotta ask him for money for my mom not that hes gonna give it to me but  well do you want company  claire you dont have to keep taking care of me  im not  i just like hanging out  we could just go for the drive then you go see your dad  and ill stay in some like creepy motel and read a stephen king book  okay  meet me after fifth period tomorrow by the gym  oh this is just what i need today  i see this is payback time for my missing your opening  just shut up  both of you for once just shut your fucking mouths  all that comes out of you is garbage garbage garbage  okay  good we have a dialogue   where did you get this  from his office  its all the data feinberg has on brenda its all destroyed  he can go to where he came from before he fucked her up  youre off the hook obviously this has nothing to do with you missing his show  dont fucking talk about me like im not here  even though im not and never have been  son whats wrong just tell us  theres nothing wrong with me  i didnt sell my daughter to some smug starfucking psychiatrist  so he could pick her apart like a goddamn cadaver  and turn her into shit and garbage just like everything you touch   billy sweetheart  you bitch  youre the fucking nurse you wanna tie us up lock us in a room leave us to die  well youre the one that should die you and him  you dont get to touch the children  i refuse to be an audience for this  oh boy you can juice her but you better let me take care of that skin  this guy has a really sinewy neck  sinewy i love saying that word dont you   i dont know  i went out with this guy once  he had a really sinewy neck he was a total animal in bed  i mean the things he could do with his tongue  he thought he was gods gift to women i guess in that one respect he was   so do you like sinewy necks david  i never really thought about it  hey im just trying to figure out your type  believe me i can tell youre single  and i know about a million people i can set you up with  so what kind of guys do you like  what makes you think that i like men  oh please lets not play that game   i think we should fire her  im thinking the same thing   has she made a lot of mistakes  no  shes a little hard to take  shes a lot hard to take  sometimes people are hard to take  but only because the first side they present is annoying or aggressive  because theyre nervous  after you spend some time with them  you realize maybe theres another side to them thats worth knowing  or not i have no idea what im talking about  sorry im late  by the way i wont be here for dinner tomorrow so everyones on their own  actually im going to be volunteering with the food distribution  well that leaves you and me claire you wanna go to the apple pan  cant i have to do this astronomy overnight thing  at the observatory for school  i didnt hear about this  i told you you probably werent listening  thats the type of thing i would listen to  david and nate did it when they went to bonaventure  david you did this   yeah i had to  you too nate  back then we thought pluto was a planet   when did pluto stop being a planet  a few months ago  well i suppose its okay for you to go  luckily gareth isnt going to press charges  but i did promise him that steps would be taken to remedy the situation  i wish id been there to see the look on feinbergs face  im sure he started with his whole blinking thing  brenda we have a serious problem  okay ill talk to billys doctor see if he needs to be on different medication  we were thinking of something a little more involved  your mother and i feel that he needs to go away for intensive therapy  theres a very good facility in colorado  you wanna put billy in an institution  oh please lets not turn this into a 1950s bmovie  this place is run by excellent psychiatric specialists  who may have some creative solution to help billy  you wanna give him shock treatment  darling really this dramatic streak arent you a little old for it  and just for the record electroconvulsive therapys had a real resurgence  in the last 10 years with very impressive results   you cant do this  we think its best  it certainly makes your lives easier  god forbid billy should embarrass you in front of your stupid celebrity friends  unfortunately hes an adult which means you cant  have him committed unless he does something dangerous  darling  we were thinking if you talked to him explained how it would help him  fuck you both youre out of your minds  hi im angela you must be ruth  yes  i spilled some beet salad on someones wig  so david said i should eat up here  i got the stains out  everyone in my family gets cancer so i know tons about taking care of wigs  is that yours the hair i mean  as far as i know  its beautiful  thank you  i dont wanna be one of those menopausal women  that goes all dykey with the butch haircut  so nate says that youre dating a hairdresser  that is so lucky  if hes good id love to know if he can do anything with this mop  does your boyfriend come around  hes not exactly my boyfriend  oh come on youre blushing  must be pretty serious is it  is it serious or is it just hot sex  im really not in the mood to discuss my personal life  you have one new message  hey its me  look its better if i just go by myself  you should probably just not worry about it okay  thank you for trying to to  look just thank you  so thats thats it i guess  goodbye claire  this is disgusting you have crap in here from the 80s  billy ill get a plumber somebody who actually knows what theyre doing  would you look at me id

angela does her job perfectly  what about the hairs in her mole rico wouldve never left those there  angela had a long philosophical debate about it  and decided the nieces would wanna remember her exactly how she was  id like to know the meaning of this  nikolai is picking me up to go to dinner  and i was planning to serve him sherry beforehand  i wanted to use the goblets i got from my cousin hannahs trip to dresden  now i cant because someone broke this and hoped i wouldnt notice it   which one of you did this  it wasnt me  well it wasnt me   it was angela  oh it was definitely angela  hi

be trying them again  im glad to hear you say that  you know what that shit has done to my sister  it can seriously fuck up your life david  id hate to see that happen  it was stupid i know i was just  you know rico left it was just nate and me  not that its an excuse  whats up with that kid i saw you with at the club  lets just say it was a learning experience  everyone else has gone home i dont know what you two are waiting for  david this isnt one of your regular shifts  is there any special reason you showed up here tonight  no  oh well  well good night you two  good night  you hungry  im always hungry  you fucking bitch  i would like to tear your heart out like you have torn out mine  theres supposed to be a picture of nate peeing on a wall   i see it  i dont  four from the left  oh my god  whatd your mom say when she saw that  she was kind of horrified i think  how is your mom  shes dating its weird   why  because shes my mother  shes not supposed to date  people should be with people  yeah sometimes people are just too stupid to know it  hows your taco  disgusting  i had no idea about you and nikolai  for six years every saturday night i cook for him dinner  and then he take me to a 250 movie on fairfax  then you come along and he stop calling  i have to see every goddamn film this freddie prinze jr does  and what do i have to show for it  im sorry  do you want to marry nicky or not  marriage is the last thing i would ever want again  maybe i have an amusing flirtation with nikolai  but he scares me  best of all i have this job  something i never would have predicted for myself  and i love it  because its mine  and i would never do anything to jeopardize that  which means i should probably just finish dinner with nikolai  and go home  thank you ive had the best time coming to this funny restaurant  and having you yell at me in the bathroom  do you realize the whole time we were going out  i was never in your bedroom at night  well  youre here now arent you  whoa this is not the david i know  maybe this is the real me   im not sure we should  why not  well im kind of seeing somebody right now   i dont care  well i do  come on david  whyd you come up here if you werent into something happening  to talk to you to see how you were doing to be friends   i dont wanna be friends i wanna fuck  well im not into that  cant we just have sex it doesnt have to mean anything  its getting late  i should just go  you take care of yourself  claire what are you doing here  i thought david and i covered for you so you could be out having fun  whats wrong  shit theres this really big hole in my sock   maybe gabe just wanted to be alone  i know   is he your boyfriend  no  its just  he needs me  for the first time in my life i felt important like someone needed me  you know like not just like some annoying extra person  just lumped in with everyone else  no ones ever needed me  i need you  right  i felt this really intense connection  now its just gone  and i want it back  i want him back  is there something wrong with me  is there something about me that makes me deserve something like this  deserve what  just feeling really close to someone then having them just disappear  like i mean nothing  claire gabe just went to visit his father for a day  i think youre talking about dad  look we never talk about him  and thats okay if thats what you want  but at some point youre gonna have to deal with how you feel  oh god cant i just get upset  without having to focus on whats really making me upset  well it worked for me for 34

talked billy into committing himself  she just loves saying that it makes her father and i sound more like monsters  well i didnt do it and im not going to  goddamn it  i asked for chives and they

gotten back from a conference to find our house on fire  it started right below the family room  remember we had it redone when you were away  yeah but billy was  i went to visit him in the hospital he was there all summer  your father and i put him there we had no choice  that fire wasnt accidental brenda he was making a bomb  this is getting really fucking desperate what now billys the unabomber  he had written things ugly violent things about your father and me  about you he was dangerous  you let me believe for all these years that billy tried to kill himself  we were only trying to protect you honey  get out of my house  get out of my house you fucking lunatic   its a wonder im even alive  hello   youre like fucking medea  dave this is a really bad time  you know what the really sick thing is mother  you have no idea what youve done to me  brenda   brenda hang on  ill call you later nate  when that assholes out of my house  dave i gotta go  what you fired her already  oh for chrissake  you shouldve lined up somebody why are you whispering  im hiding up here until she finishes mrs sarno  so which of those other people did you like best  look lets not make any quick decisions  i guess i could probably live with the panicattack guy  ive got a better idea  hey rico  bad time  no everyones at lunch except me and pam  youre one of the fishers arent you  cigarette

just tell you  its totally unlike me i usually just say whatever im thinking  i noticed  but i saw that broken glass  and i just was overcome with this feeling that it was  better to just ignore it  just pretend that it didnt happen i get that feeling  from all of you here  everyone is so fragile  and cant bear to hear anything  is that everything  i mean all i did was try to fix david up with this guy  and i thought he was gonna kill me i never met anyone  who was so uptight about being gay  thanks  you know something  i never worked in a funeral home that was this depressing  tell me youre happier here and ill go  its not perfect these body farms are a fucking assembly line  and ive got like 12 idiots breathing down my neck  at fisher  sons you only get two of those at the most  and gilardi lied to me  my hours are nothing like he said theyd be  and the work here is not even as challenging you know  nate  it was kroehner who burned down the house across the street  gilardis told people that hes not done trying to drive you guys out of business  does that mean it doesnt make sense for you to come back  no but if i do you have to match what im making here  plus guarantee me flexible hours for picking up julio  and helping when the baby comes  done  and if i do decide to come back  its not for good  im never gonna become a partner am i  i cant offer you that  unless you wanna marry claire  no thank you  okay i can start in a couple of days  thank you that makes me very happy and it will make david very happy  yeah hey i heard theres some picture of you in a gallery peeing  is that true  i just wanted to get gabes fathers number so i could talk to him  well why would gabes stepfather know where gabe was  no his father the one who lives in barstow  yeah gabes father died when he was 4  yeah  oh if you should run into gabe  would you tell him i really dont appreciate his staying out all night  so thats thats it i guess  goodbye claire  mrs dimas  mrs
