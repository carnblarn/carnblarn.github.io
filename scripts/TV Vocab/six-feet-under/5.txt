church   really which one  st stephens   in the palisades  no st stephens in west hollywood  well i hope you always feel as welcome here as you did there   thanks  your father was a deacon here  and we still havent replaced him  i think it would be good for this church to listen to a younger voice  if youre at all interested i could submit your name  me a deacon  david thats wonderful your father would be so proud  well sure id be honored to be considered   ruth how are you holding up  im doing okay father   each day is just a little bit easier  thats what i love hearing  wow what a small world do you go to this church  i just joined i was raised catholic so i like the whole ritual part of it  you smell good what is that  who are you  oh my god i cant believe i never introduced myself  it seems like weve known each other forever im tracy montrose blair   hi im david  fisher i know i know who you are  okay why  because my uncle walt was buried at your funeral home  old guy cancer

seems nice  she seems nuts  hello  out here  hey   this is the life huh  apparently  so how often do mommy and daddy go away  oh constantly theyre very important people  with very important places to go  lucky for them i have absolutely nowhere to go   how are you  im good   its chilly today arent you cold  nope  jesus its like a hot tub in here  mommy and daddy keep it this hot all the time even in summer  theyre very wasteful  thats just wrong  oh man you are  what  youre unlike any woman ive ever met  good   you scare me a little  why  i dont know  its just  so much i dont know about you  me  i am an open book  im so glad youre bringing your friends home  you know you havent done that in years  you said youd be gone through the weekend  yes its sunday its the end of the weekend  nate these are my parents margaret and bernard chenowith  margaret and bernard this is nate fisher the man i am having sex with  hello  brenda has told us absolutely nothing about you  you know what im not surprised im not sure theres that much to tell  oh dont be so modest  nates studying for his funeral directors license  well nate youll have to tell us all about that   will you stay for lunch  at least a drink or two  id like to but  i really have to study  well then youll have to join us for dinner sometime  that sounds great  great  okay mrs fisher  i asked you here today so we could talk about your relationship with claire   i told her it wasnt my idea  no  claire feels that being the youngest child  perhaps she might have missed out on a time when the family was happier  no you said that  i dont think there was a time this family was ever happy  that is not true there was lots of happiness  when the boys were young when you were young claire  you were a very happy little girl and you know it  thats because i was too young to realize what freaks we were  why would you tell this man we were never happy  because i grew up in a house that was usually filled with total strangers  who were crying all the time  oh boohoo  i grew up in a tworoom apartment over a barbershop  and i spent my teenage years taking care of my grandmother  after her legs were amputated lifes hard  you had a roof over your head you didnt go hungry  she gets up on this cross and then theres just no talking to her  you did not have to go begging for food on the streets of calcutta  because i wasnt dropped in a dumpster i shouldnt want things to be better  this is good this is good for you two to talk like this  these are obviously things you need to say  so were just supposed to fight and get on each others nerves  i prefer the nottalking thing  i think you should try to have more of a dialogue  make time for it schedule it remember any relationship is work  okay excellent session   thats it  thats up to you isnt it  he does this for like five different schools  she should look spectacular thats the most important thing  well make sure that she looks her best  she was the real deal you know she was a star  and i can assure you we will give her a funeral  that befits the star that she was and always will be   you know who she was  absolutely  and im a big fan of hers  hey rico   holy moly  feel them   theyre really hard  no thanks  like a rock see how theyre all cockeyed  they got this lowcut thing they want her in and they said absolutely no bra  shit i dont know what the heck im gonna do  maybe i could like tape them together somehow  you know where this goes i put it in the wrong place david will bitch  top left above the purple stuff  well boys this just might be our highest profit margin funeral this year   shes rich huh  the guy whos paying for it is   she looks so familiar to me  shes an actress viveca st john  oh my god youre right thats her   apparently she was quite talented  she was a porno star   what  she was huge in the mid to late 80s  you never saw any of her videos   no nate i missed those  this chick fucked a snake   this chick fucked 30 guys at one time  i saw that i saw that  my cousin ramone showed me when i was like 12  on the diving board okay they were wrapped around the pool  did you see the one where the guys riding this motorcycle so hes  fucking her while riding in circles  oh shit  nate  could i speak to you outside for a minute  damn it nate the woman on that table is just as deserving of dignity  as anyone else we prepare  and federico is an employee  its up to you and me to set an example for him all right   all right im sorry  show some respect  these are human lives were dealing with here  these are not organic blackberries or granola in bulk   i said im sorry  i dont want you to be sorry  i want you to remember that what we do here is serious  because it really sucks for me always having to be the spoilsport  okay  thank you   hello  nate bernard chenowith  hi  margaret and i were wondering if you would join us for dinner tomorrow night   we wont take no for an answer  you hear that  well actually i have a lot of studying to do for this exam  nate  wed really love to be able to get a sense of who you are  and im sure youre curious about us as well right  good shall we say 7ish  can i bring anything  hello  suck on that you ugly fuck  hi  theres this thing called knocking its like protected in the first amendment  i rented some videos  i thought you and i could watch them tonight  remember when you were in middle school  you and i went to the movies every monday night  remember how much fun we had  i remember seeing a lot of really bad movies  whatd you get  runaway bride and the nutty professor  cool  oz didn t make you a bitch  you were born one  ltd be good for business too dad was a deacon there  its a big congregation people die  their families dont know where to go and the church sends them our way  they know youre gay  i think father jack has a pretty good idea   you think he likes you  keith  does this mean youre not gonna be going to church with me anymore  well if they make me a deacon id have to go there all the time yeah  im sorry i know sundays have sort of been our day  i think its great i really do  one of the things i love about you  is the fact that your religion means so much to you  besides i think it could be kind of hot you know  dating a man of the cloth   but i need you to do something for me  what is it my son  you know the gay firemen and police officers club i belong to  well were having a party in laguna this weekend   i want you to be my date  your date will i get a corsage  i want you to start meeting some of my friends david  id like that  forgive me father for i am about to sin  this is an entire movie about expelling gas  i think thats why people like it   i dont want to watch this  good because neither do i  claire look  i know you probably think im old and stupid  no mom i dont  but i love you just as much as i ever did  and im worried about you and i dont know how to help  i dont need help  why is everyone acting like im in the trenchcoat mafia   you stole a foot a human foot  okay you want to know why  because some guy who scammed me into having sex with him  because i thought he cared about me told the entire school i sucked his toes  and then when i confronted him he showed entirely no remorse  i saw nate drop the foot on the floor i grabbed it to get back at that asshole  it wasnt premeditated im not jeffrey dahmer   i dont get off on hackedup body parts  youre having sex  no jesus no im sorry i cannot have this conversation with you  and im sorry but i dont think were ever gonna have  a touchyfeely motherdaughter relationship like on tv and the movies  because you know what they dont exist  heres our guest  and he brought us a bottle of louis jadot pinot noir   1997 no less  okay a man who knows his wine  im liking you more and more nate  well i worked at a food coop in seattle for a long time learned a little bit  a coop so theres a little hippie in there huh  that makes sense brenda would find that attractive  she likes to think of herself as being wildly countercultural  i think shes actually just jealous of the fact  that bern and i really were hippies briefly   can i offer you a drink  sure do you have any beer  no we have vodka scotch bourbon   ill have a little bourbon  manly but not elitist just her type  down girl  so where is brenda  brenda oh brendas not coming tonight   really  she felt and i have to agree with her  wed have a better chance of getting to know each other if she werent here  she does tend to take center stage so to speak   i wish somebody had thought to tell me  im sorry i assumed she did  there you are  david was raised in this church  he was christened and confirmed here he served as an altar boy  and he was president of the youth ministry in high school   how old are you david  im 31   what do you do for a living  im a funeral director  his father served as a deacon for over a decade he just recently passed away  so you see this as a sort of passing the torch  no sir i see it as a chance to serve god  well im glad to hear you say that because thats what it is  being a deacon is more than just having access to the church mailing list  and passing out your business cards after mass  sir i wont deny that i run a business  providing service to people in times of need  but i would never exploit my relationship to the church for marketing purposes  frankly i consider that to be a pretty grave sin  no pun intended  st bartholomew is an old church  a conservative church  a church that doesnt need to have its boat rocked  which is precisely why i feel david is a good candidate  how many men his age have values as strong as his  i think he would be an excellent role model   are you married  no sir i was engaged briefly  is there anything else youd like to tell me about yourself  before i consider this  no sir  is there anything specific about me that youd like to ask  no  ill let you know my decision in a few days   you impressed him  you think  yes  oh by the way one of our parishioners recently lost her father to liver cancer  sharon murdoch i gave her your name you may be getting a call  thank you   again with the not knocking  pack some things   were going to san bernardino  what  were spending the night at my cousin hannahs   mom im doing homework  well stop   i have school tomorrow  ill write a note  its been a long time since brendas wanted us to meet  any of the men in her life   what was that last one chiropractor  he was a rolfer  he was an idiot  well im not sure brenda ever meant for us to meet  i dont think she expected you guys to come home that day  oh nate  where brendas concerned there are no coincidences   you think she planned all this  of course  shes a master manipulator  i love her dearly but you really ought to know what youre getting into  would you like another bourbon  no thanks  can i ask you guys something  as long as it doesnt involve asking us for money  no it doesnt  does the name nathaniel have any significance to you  well sure nathaniel and isabel  brenda adored these books as a little girl  she could read by the time she was 3   what are they about  two orphans who had adventures  they ran away from an orphanage  there was a malevolent nurse who was always hunting them down  but they always managed to outsmart her  typical infantile wish fulfillment   ive never even heard of them  theyre british quite dark  people die in them all the time  when brendas brother was born  we expected serious displacement anxiety from her but there was none  she would sit next to his crib and read him these stories for hours   she was what then bern 4  5 at most  its all in the book  this book  you mean she didnt tell you about that either  i feel terrible   im sorry i snapped at grandma  yeah huh  that was a pretty freaky friday moment we had back there  ruthie i am so glad you called  ginnie and i would never allow ourselves this kind of food  unless it were a really special occasion  we are definitely gonna have to do an extra spinning class this week  tomorrow morning   whos teaching  derek  im so there  mom and i have the hugest crush on this spinning instructor at the y  he is hot hot hot  so claire have you thought about college  yeah  id love to go to like nyu or columbia  but i dont know if i could ever get in so  well there are some great schools in la  why would you want to go to school in the same town you grew up in  i go to cal state right here in san berdoo   well whatever rocks your boat  claire  hey i love it  by living at home im saving a ton of money for grad school  im not stuck in a crappy dorm where everyones smoking pot  and playing loud music all the time  and i dont have to call campus police every time i walk home from the library  so that i dont get raped   and i like to stay close to my mom  that translates to i do her laundry  oh thats not true  i love my mom and im not ashamed of it  thank you honey i love you too  okay anybody want more   so how was it  oh it was quite informative  i know what nathaniel means now i know you have an iq of 185  i know you had a book written about you  here i signed it for you  why didnt you just tell me about this  people always change after they read it i was trying to make the fun part last  oh god so youre kind of scarily brilliant i can handle that  what i cant handle is the way you keep mindfucking me  for your personal entertainment its really starting to piss me off  im sorry im not a wellbehaved little nothing that never challenges you  but if thats what youre looking for you might as well just leave right now  so what youre trying to drive me away  yeah nate im trying to drive you away  it was my mothers idea that i not be there  which is fine by me i dont really enjoy their company  she said it was your idea  yeah she would she probably believes that shes out of her mind  you couldve warned me what i was walking into  you wouldnt have gone  i just wanted to get it all out of the way  them the book everything  yeah well i felt like a fucking lab rat over there  yeah thats what they do  im 6 years old i score through the roof on some standardized biased test  and it all becomes about them  they hand me over to strangers experts a bunch of academic fucks  who scrutinized everything i did or said or thought even  it is a fucking law of physics that the very act of observation  changes that which is being observed  and now youre gonna read that book and think that you know me   well you know what you dont  yeah because you wont let me  okay fine what do you want to know  ask me anything  did you burn down that house that we made love in  you think i burned down the house  really that is so weird  well what am i supposed to think  you put my brother and me in the bus that killed our father  you get weird phone calls from screaming people you wont explain  now you wanna make me feel stupid for being suspicious  give me a fucking reason not to be  i just want to know what this is  for you  am i just another step along your way  okay look  we obviously have an intense sexual connection  and yes i would like for there to be something more than that  but that cant ever happen until you trust me which apparently you dont  should i trust you  yes  come here  ra  k e  triple letter score for k good one mom  hell  hell  o  hello  d  e  f  t  deft what is deft  well its a laundry detergent from when ruth and i were kids  no its a word it means skilled  really use it in a sentence  he deftly juggled his responsibilities  deft  or deft where ith thy sting  so how you both doing you know with nathaniel passing   better every day  you know shit happens  you know its such an awful thing losing someone you love  in terms of stress its right up there with moving and getting fired  i know when ed and i split up i was devastated  i didnt even want to get out of bed i just wanted to curl up and die  and all i can say is thank god for my precious daughter  well i just wouldnt let her mope just wouldnt let her  dragged her ass pardon my french out of bed  and took her to spinning class with me  and i hated her for it at the time but it really got me back on track  you know endorphins really are natures antidepressants  life goes on it doesnt go on by itself  sometimes you just gotta kick it in the butt  but ed didnt die  hes still alive you can still see him  when ginnie gets married youll both be there  when she has children theyll be able to know him  hes not gone forever  yeah well sure but  in terms of the impact it had on both our lives  its similar  okay i have the greatest idea  you guys are coming to spinning class with us tomorrow bright and early  no offense but id rather drive a rusty railroad spike through my skull  oh just try it once  you might be surprised how it changes the way you feel   i feel fine  you know what ginnie  that is absolutely an inspired idea  okay ladies lets get to bed because if your butt isnt on that bike by 6 a m  derek doesnt let you in  so these tits do nothing for you huh  well i can appreciate that they are beautiful  in their own completely artificial way  men loved them well real men  you think god cares that youre gay  you think god cares that you fucked 30 guys at once  oh so you equate being a fag with being a whore   no  ones okay but one isnt  i think god appreciates it when loves involved  oh honey  i loved every man i ever fucked while i was fucking him   what are you doing  watching you  claire wake up get dressed   why  were leaving hurry  jesus mom im starting to feel like anne frank  if we dont get out of here fast well have to go spinning  oh my god   lets go  wait  what are you doing what are you doing  thanks for buying me breakfast  thank you for finding my gspot this morning  anytime  oh i have something for you  wow   oh come on its just a key  no this is great  im a little surprised thats all  im too nervous to eat  ill just drink coffee until i start twitching and sweating  why does being a deacon mean so much to you now   it wasnt a consideration a week ago  i know you think its naive  but i see it as a chance to make a difference  make the world a little more tolerant  david we have our own church in west hollywood  which means the other churches and dioceses dont have to tolerate us  frankly i resent the notion that i need to be tolerated  so what we should just allow ourselves to be ghettoized  why do you embrace an organization that doesnt embrace you   the church embraces everyone  right hate the sin love the sinner   the operative word being hate  what is with you  the other night you said you liked the idea  i had a chance to think  isnt that your brother  okay look can we just have breakfast  without me feeling like im george will and youre cokie roberts with pms  you probably like george will  dave   hi  hey  keith you remember my brother nate dont you   hows it going  hey  this is brenda  my   my girlfriend  i prefer the term fuck puppet  so what are you guys doing here you just play racquetball   no no we just worked out  oh so you guys work out together  yeah  yeah we do  oh well thats great  okay great  okay you guys have a great day  you too  bye david  oh my god i think david is gay  i think david is lucky did you get a look at that guy  claire  i had an affair  for the last two years i was seeing someone  your father never knew about it at least i hope he didnt  and i called it off after he died  its not something im proud of   why are you telling me this  because its the truth  and whatever relationship you and i have i want it to be honest  even if you hate me  mom i dont hate you  i remember going to the movies on monday nights  but im 17 years old now and i have my own life  and theres things i have to figure out on my own  and thats like normal  and i know stealing a foot is weird  but hello living in a house where a foot is available to be stolen is weird  i gotta get to school   did you see his face  oh man  i know i shouldnt be laughing but he looked so stupefied  the way he was all great great im hip im cool  proud of you man  so listen this thing in laguna is saturday night  i got us a room at the surf and sand you ever been there   no  man its gonna be great  we got a fireplace overlooking the ocean  keith i dont think i can make it after all  i shouldnt miss church not while theyre considering me for a deaconship   im sorry  fine  well come back saturday night   thatll work  i can go to church with you on sunday  thats not a good idea  this hasnt been a good idea from the beginning has it  fine why dont we cut our losses  and call it quits right now  what  look as long as you feel the need to keep our relationship a secret  david youre ashamed of it im not having any of that not anymore   i just came out to my brother  one step forward  now you want to take a giant leap backwards into the arms of the enemy  so now im a nazi collaborator  a lot of africanamericans might say the same thing about you  being a member of the lapd  you fucking coward  keith please dont  it works  i must have left the stereo on again  so you are not too freaked out  a little maybe  it makes david more interesting  no i mean about me giving you a key to my apartment  what do you think i am an aging peter pan whos gonna disappear  at the sign of something permanent  well yeah  youre one to talk you couldnt even allow me to refer to you as my girlfriend  dont mind me  i thought we agreed that you would call before you came over  i did the hot waters out in my building i needed to take a shower  dont be mad at me  you know i hate it when youre mad at me  hey its me i need to use your shower okay  besides i haven t seen you in a while and its a fucking gorgeous day   satisfied  im going to make a cup of tea  hey  ill take one of those  hey you behave yourself  hi whats your name   nate  nice to meet you im billy  hi  so how long you known brenda  a few months  so  who am i and why am i in your girlfriends house practically naked   yeah  shes my sister  shes my mother sister my mother  sorry nobodys ever laughed at that i should know better  its nice to meet you   so you met the parents yet  yes last night  wow  youve made it pretty far  so why havent i heard about you  no idea  well i guess i better go put some clothes on  howd you get her breasts synchronized some sort of industrial epoxy  would you ask colonel sanders for his secret recipe  oh come on im not gonna tell  i stuck a can of cat food under each one  my sisterinlaw did a cat food commercial  weve got like 10 cases  hey im larry wadd  you know  i met viveca st john before she even did her first video  yeah she was  she was the fluffer on the set of dirty larry 3  she was  friendly she was eager  i can honestly say ive never received a better blowjob in my life  and nobody was even filming it  when i first met viveca i met her on deep diving  thank you  and i had never gone down on a girl before so naturally i was nervous  but viveca was so warm and relaxed about it  she really put me at ease  well her and the two xanax she gave me  and when i first had to do a double penetration  i was like a total wreck  but viveca came through like such the pro she is  i mean was   nate what the hell is going on in there  a funeral  for whom a prostitute  a woman who was a star of adult videos  mom were gonna clear  we can finally pay for all that air conditioning work  im just glad your sister is at school  it was awful theyre like best friends  theyre both like cheerleaders with this totally plastic way of life  like spinning class solves everything  and theyre both hot for the same guy it was creepy  my moms  my mom is just so fucking sad  and i wish i could help her  so help her  now mrs murdoch some people prefer the solemnity of a church  and st bartholomew is a beautiful setting  here however one is more free to customize the service  im sorry to interrupt i just had to tell somebody  viveca looks so great her tits have never looked better  she was like a sister to me  im so glad that youre pleased  we want to remember her at her very best dont we  now im sorry but im helping some other people right now   okay  ill talk to you after the service  okay  i think well have dads service at the church  fine  im not a religious man but i do believe in god  if i were to make a list of the things i thank god for the most  fucking viv would be at the top of that list  she was a goddamn force of nature  and i loved her and i know god loved her too  i know he knew just what he was doing  and how much joy  she would bring to the world  for david james fisher chosen deacon in your church  we pray to you o lord  lord hear our prayer  that he may faithfully fulfill the duties of this ministry  build up your church and glorify your name  we pray to you o lord  lord hear our prayer  that by the indwelling of the holy spirit he may be sustained and encouraged  to persevere to the end  we pray to you o lord  lord hear our prayer  for all who fear god and believe in you lord christ  that our divisions may cease and that all may be as one  as you and the father are one   we pray to you o lord  lord hear our prayer  way to go dave  all i have to do is join the kiwanis club  and fisher  sons will have all our bases covered  wheres keith  hes just a friend nate   very good to see you  hello  so mom what are you doing tomorrow night  nothing as far as i know why  i thought maybe youd want to go see a movie or rent a movie or something  okay but if you cry the whole thing is off  thanks for coming today   i know you mustve found this a little  are you kidding i loved it  all that pageantry its so trippy its like a fellini movie  well it was kind of cool being with you here in front of god and everybody   you dont really believe in god do you  well yeah  i mean i dont believe in some bearded old white man up in a cloud  but i believe in something  some sort of undefinable creative force  i think its just all totally random  really  yeah  we live we die ultimately nothing means anything  how can you live like that  i dont know sometimes i wake up so fucking empty  i wish id never been born but what choice do i have
