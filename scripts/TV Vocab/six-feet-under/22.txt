                vance i dont know whats wrong with me ive got no fucking appetite lately   thats a sign of depression  really  oh yeah ive been reading up on it  ever since my wifes hysterectomy shes been real down in the dumps  loss of appetite loss of sex drive  feelings of hopelessness and despair no energy all of which she has  i only got the loss of appetite thing  you know what is depressing  my wifes cooking here  what the fuck is that it looks like cat shit  i think it is cat shit  shes fucking useless in the kitchen she always has been   at least your wife still fucks you  thank god  if she didnt do that id have to kill her  shit  oh fuck  fuck me  this is fucked  fucking fuck   its kind of beautiful isnt it  yeah its way beautiful  you add the sunset factor itll be perfect  theres horseshit everywhere  so  so isnt it gonna mess up your white dress  yeah like im gonna wear a white dress  besides if we exchange vows surrounded by horseshit  itd be kind of fitting  meaning you think us getting married is a shitty idea  meaning were going into this openeyed shit and all  and hopefully my mother will step in some of it  or even better fall face first into it and then it really will be the happiest day of my life  are you sure you want to marry me we can still call it off  of course i want to marry you  but i could die bren  i mean i could die any day i could die any moment  yeah and i couldnt  yeah were all gonna die i know  but the chances of it actually happening are significantly higher for me  thats just a fucking fact and the last thing i want  is for you to marry me because you feel sorry for me  you really think id do that  youve made enough sacrifices in your life without having to go through some  im marrying you because i love you  youre the first man i thought i could stand to spend the rest of my life with  or the rest of your life if its tragically cut short or whatever  youre not some car i want to trade in because it has faulty transmission  jesus do you really think im that shallow  of course not  all we have is this moment  right here right now  the future is just a fucking concept that we use  to avoid being alive today  so  be here  now  so why do we need to get married at all then  so we can rack up all that free shit from all my mothers wealthy friends thats why  hey i know this really cool rabbi who can possibly do our wedding   a rabbi  yeah   why would you even go there  you are halfjewish  yeah im also halfcatholic so you wanna invite the pope  its a marriage its a sacred occasion  youd rather have just some civil servant there  personally i think the two of us should be enough to make it sacred  hey did you sleep okay  no  i finally dozed off around 500  keith go back to bed  im not gonna sleep anymore believe me  maybe you should talk to your doctor about medication  yeah drugs thats the answer  youre right suffering when you dont have to thats much more constructive   idiot  fuck you  is there any more coffee  i really dont think you should be drinking caffeine when your sleep is so erratic  suit yourself  bitch  taylor left her gummy vitamins  big surprise she hated those  i should

thought you and parker had a fallingout  we made up  i figured it was better to have a loser for a friend than to have no friends at all  well what are you doing with her  were going to the getty  do

damage thats a plus  im gonna have to do some major plugins on the top of the head here though  its a good thing hes not bald  whys that  itd be a little hard to wig him  since everybody remembered him with his head all nice and shiny you know  hello  oh for christs sake  i gotta swing by appleby and pick up the parliament   you probably need some help with that  not really  yes really  hello anyone  please im so bored  thats not my problem pal   hes gotta be driving you crazy  not at all  actually our relationship has reached a whole new level  how so  well its not just about the sex anymore  theres more intimacy hes letting his guard down  hes allowing me to see him at his most vulnerable  well thats great cupcake  clarify one thing for me he is bedridden right  hello who is there  can you help me  that depends on what you want  i ate already my lunch and i am starving i cannot walk  she is my favorite this one such a bitch  she would be a wildcat in love i think  shes the kind that leaves scratch marks all over your body  yeah but shes like 60  doesnt matter besides i think shes latin  theyre always hotblooded   what kind of sandwich this is  pork  it is not so good needs salt   lf you dont like it ill eat it  no i will eat  it was supposed to be mine anyway   what happened to your face  its none of your fucking business pal  okay  sorry  i dont understand im his wife  he should be buried with me  well unfortunately he stipulated in his preneed contract  that he was to be buried with his former wife  thats gotta be a mistake he mustve made those arrangements before he married me  this is dated october of 98  i never even knew he had done this  neither did his daughters  god im sure they just love it though  theyve always hated me  they thought their daddy was too good for me  and apparently so did he  im sure thats not true  so this things all signed sealed and paid for  theres no recourse for me  well actually it hasnt been paid in full  really  you know he did leave everything to me  and i hope you dont think im gonna be paying for such a blatant slap in my face  what the hell is mom doing in belize  shes on some sort of cruise for the recently separated  maybe its for people who want to quit smoking  what a freak  im fine with water  have you spoken to dad  yeah right  so whats with you living with her  well it sure beats the hospital  you know bren i still go in three times a week to see dr hanover  shes great   yeah  yeah shes a total genius  shes helped me look at a lot of my shit  thats good  yeah  so hows nate  hes not so great  he was recently diagnosed with this brain condition  and hes had a couple of seizures actually  he could have a stroke  shit   that sucks  yeah  well now i know why youre marrying him  fuck you  wow that hit a nerve must be true  no im just a little surprised at how randomly cruel you can be  i guess id forgotten what a kick you get out of that  see this is what you do  you invalidate anything i say that might challenge your authority  you learned it from mom  the same way that you learned to explain everything to me   like im an idiot from dad  no i learned that from you  apparently youre still angry at me for committing you  no that was the best thing that could have happened to me  then why wouldnt you see me  or take my calls or email  because dr hanover suggested  that i might be able to do more constructive work  if i cut things off with you for a while  because you have contributed a lot to my pathology   you have a medical condition  its not just about pharmaceuticals  i never developed any functional way to deal with the world  because you kept me from it  ive done a real number on you  you were always there looking out for me protecting me being strong for me  i never learned how to take care of myself  i mean shit brenda ive never even had a real girlfriend  i never let you have a girlfriend thats really  you fucking asshole  i thought we could have a rational discussion  how dare you blame me for that billy  im not saying that you did it on purpose  but i do think we need to disengage from each other  because our relationship is really toxic  okay  and i dont know how long it needs to last  probably a very long time  maybe  anyway  i have somewhere i have to be but thank you for the grub   hey you look nice  thanks  where you going   to meet a friend  billy chenowith  yeah  i dont think you should be seeing him  ill just file that under couldnt possibly matter less  he can be dangerous  i can take care of myself nate  okay are you armed in case he pulls a knife on you   how much time have you spent with him  how much time have you spent with him  enough to know he isnt a drooling psychopath hes got a disease  he went through a period where he went off his medication  because he was fucked up and in denial about it  its under control now sound familiar  it was very slow at work today  it is because i wasnt there   you and robbie are lazy  that is not true  why just today i reorganized the ribbons i cleaned the inside of the cash register  and i spent a couple of hours looking at the books   that is not your job  no and its apparently not yours either  ive never seen a messier more incoherent bookkeeping system  i thought my husband was bad  i dont want you messing with my books  this is my personal finances none of your business  may i remind you that ive been paying your medical bills  i will pay back  youre gonna be in big trouble if you get audited   that bullshit  language  so listen i really wanted to thank you  for what  for being the only person who kept in touch with me  while i was in the home for the tragically inappropriate  are you kidding me  your emails were totally brilliant i saved them all  it was the only thing that kept me going  i know i would never have given me a second chance  after the way i treated you the first time we met   so no word from gabe at all  nada  which is fine like seriously good riddance  it was so obvious he was never gonna take charge of his life you know  well its hard few people ever do  yeah but most people are able to avoid becoming drugaddict criminals  yeah most people  hey what are you doing tomorrow  im not sure why  well i need some help with this project  and theres not really anybody else i can ask   okay  yeah  cool  were back with our exclusive visit  with one of the years happiest and sexiest couples david and keith fishercharles  so guys tell me how do you do it   well leeza it takes a lot of work  its not that much work  hes right weve done all the work  i think people dont appreciate how important that is  no they really dont   now youve got kids how many  two   and were talking about a third  yeah were talking about a third  i think the key is to do everything together  from pta meetings to the white party in palm springs  togetherness is the key were a partnership were a team   how long have i been asleep  about an hour i think  shit  im never gonna get back to sleep tonight  why didnt you wake me up  because youre totally sleepdeprived you should take it where you can get it   are you staying here tonight  i was planning on it   would you rather i didnt  maybe i dont know  maybe were moving a little too fast  okay i can go home  i mean its just that weve spent the last six nights together  yeah sure no problem  call me tomorrow  what   its what our father wanted  no its what you want   because youve never liked me  well you got that right  you couldnt control your father when he was alive  and now youre trying to do it when hes dead  it was his decision  there is a significant unpaid balance on the account  well pay for it  take money from them youll hear from my attorney  i really dont think thats necessary  no i gave the last six years of my life to that man  and contrary to what these stupid bitches think  i really did love him and i will not be humiliated like this  well if you do not follow our fathers instructions exactly  youll hear from our attorney   who used to work for disney  bring it on ferret face   fuck you you golddigging slut  how dare you  there are naked pictures of you on the internet my son showed them to me  shut up all of you shut the fuck up  jesus christ a man died  your husband your father  he lived a life and now hes dead  show some respect  and if you really loved him and i believe you did  youll give him what he wanted  if you dont then you never really loved him its as simple as that  thank you  and if i so much as get a phone call from anybodys lawyer  well give the body back  and the three of you can tear him to pieces like fucking jackals if you want to  its not your decision  god  oh my god  hey im right here okay  its okay  what happened to me keith  i used to be okay  i used to be able to live without all this sadness  without all this   never having any hope  youre here arent you  and my baby  shes so precious  i am such a bad mother  hey look at me no youre not  ive seen worse believe me i have  none of its her fault  she doesnt deserve this  look lets just put it all behind you okay  i wish we could just start over   nate hi  what are you doing here  im just  remember when i told you about that movie producer who was looking for a vegan chef  i finally caved in and took the job   cool  yeah finally sold out   so you live here now  well the palisades  since when  since right after christmas  i didnt want to bother you you have a whole new life and all  lisa come on were friends  theres a great juice bar here lets get caught up okay  okay  of all the lies were fed on which we gorge in our comfortaddicted world  none is more insidious than the lie of romance  the seductive but infantile notion  that somewhere there exists someone to complement us in every way  someone who will make us complete  of course this illusion  keeps us from ever being complete in and of ourselves  and eventually encourages us  to despise our shortcomings our flaws  everything in which our humanity lies  our humanity without which of course  we are nothing  its strange i mean shes a strict vegan  but she drinks like a fish and she does a lot of blow  but shes nice to me and i needed to make some real money for a change  so whats new with you  well not much same old same old you know   hows brenda  shes great were  were engaged   youre kidding  yeah i know its   what about you you seeing anybody  no not really  by the way im pregnant   wow thats great  yeah five months  shes a kicker  dont worry i dont expect anything from you   i dont expect anything at all  lisa i dont  dont you remember when you came to seattle last august and you fucked me  then you left the next day like it didnt mean a goddamn thing  it did mean something to you cause you were crying like a baby  thats not the reason i was crying  you were crying cause you knew you were home because you missed me  because you knew that you and i should be together then you fucked me  then you chickened out the next day and i saw you for exactly who you are  a coward who was never going to own up to the way he really felt about me  how could you not tell me about this  because we already went through this once before  but this time im gonna do it im gonna have it without you  i dont know  congratulations you know on the whole getting married thing   she must be out of her fucking mind  just give me  dont  come on in  all right let me show you  you can put your purse down if you like  here it is  this is your focus and this is your zoom  thats pretty much it  so here you go  youll get a feel for it  okay what do you want me to do  just you know follow your instincts relax dont think about yourself at all   i know thats impossible for a 1 7 yearold  eighteen  what you dont know is youre going to be 18 for the rest of your life  ive tried to do selfportraits before  but they always turn out so contrived like im trying to be some version of myself  so fucking juvenile  and i really want to see it you know  i want to  i need to see what ive done  and i think it really is impossible for somebody to see themselves  you need someone elses eyes  i need somebody else to see me  somebody who isnt brenda  she sees things a little too darkly  i mean i dont need any help going there  besides ive looked through her eyes enough for one lifetime you know  what are you seeing  im on your scar really close up  what does it look like  like the surface of the moon  thats good  thats the thing about narcissus  its not that hes so fucking in love with himself because he isnt at all  fucking hates himself  its that without that reflection looking back at him  he doesnt exist  billy are you okay  yeah dont be freaked out this is good this is exactly what i needed to happen  im fucking crying  oh god im sorry this is intense you can go  its okay ill be all right i swear   nikolai  i told you hes not here  where is

way to go buddy boy  nice to know youre not shooting blanks right  oh god what the fuck am i going to do  you dont have to do anything thats the beauty part  no i have to tell brenda  no you dont  i cant keep something like this from her were getting married  not if you tell her youre not  you really think shed stay with you  my guess is shes just looking for a way out anyway  you know ever since she found about the  what  you think she meant everything she said about sticking with you  oh yeah  nothing turns the women on more than a potentially fatal brain condition  try coughing up blood i bet youll be getting laid left and right  you know buddy boy sometimes you can be a fucking moron   i cant  sure you can  you can get away with anything theres shit on me you still dont know  things youll never know and let me tell you youre better off for it  no i should tell her she deserves that  you want to die alone go right ahead  oh my god it was hallucinatory and im sorry but it was so

fucking center of life  wow for a random fuck sounds pretty great  but it wasnt him i dont even remember him  god what was it  ive had spontaneous anonymous sex before  maybe its just the thrill of breaking the rules  you are engaged  you keep harping on about that its not it  its not about me and nate its not it at all  its about me not being outside myself for once  not watching not analyzing every goddamn moment as it happens  not holding back just becoming  pure sensation  becoming energy just becoming nature   sounds pretty great  yeah oh my god  it was such a fucking rush  and then i came home and i wrote a whole 12 pages without stopping  what if im losing my shit  what if this is the beginning of some serious mental illness you know  chances are i am genetically predisposed
