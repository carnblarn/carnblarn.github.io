10 years  chemo 3 times  that was hard i really loved him  i really loved him  im so sorry  when did you remarry  wellthere was one in  between the two that died  he was just a dog  he tried to sleep with every  single one of my girlfriends  he probably live to be a hundred and  screwing other peoples wives the whole time  son of a bitch  oh im so sorry  no its okay it is funny  i just never thought of myself as lucky  having only buried one husband before  lucky unlucky i dont know  im unlucky i ran through 3 husbands  im lucky i got to retire early off the insurance  im unlucky my son

change their lives  now shes hoarding firearms  in a compound in montana  no  shes always been very susceptible  to group mentality  maybe i couldve given her a stronger  sense of self but you know  i did my best some things are just genetic  well what are you going to do  cant you get some kind of a  de programmer to go in and rescue her  you know what shes an adult  i mean its her life now  maybe i screwed her up maybe i didnt  my son turned out fine  how are your kids  finei think  i have to go i have a job interview  in two hours and i have to shower  what kind of job  as an accountant for a

true  i think itd be better to go to breakfast  the french marketplace has a 3 99 special  she was running from a group of boys  who were whistling  and she got scared that they were  following her into a parking structure  so  she ran into the street  the car was speeding it was dark  im so sorry  did they catch the boys  they were the ones who called the ambulance  they were her friends  im sorry i dont quite understand  they were just playing around  they were all in a state of shock  that a woman could be terrified by  a group of men chasing her at night  of course you dont think  its your friends  when they saw her running  they tried calling her name  but it was too late  it was an accident  im here with your cake  thanks just pass it in here  inwhere  are you okay  i just need to have my cake in a safe  white place today  did something happen  i had a very upsetting conference  call with kate hudsons people  its unbelievably demeaning to have  these little girls in their 800 shoes  who grew up watching music  videos telling me what a movie is  ive been in this business for 20 years  ive worked with stallone ellen barkin  melanie fucking griffith  my work is everything to me  i havent even had a life  no im on the fuckin set  dealing with everyone elses crisis  roping in the director firing the  writer wrangling the star  and who takes care of me  who even wants to take care of me  that sounds really hard  uch its so bright out here  careful lisa these sheets  are new from pratesi  do you have your cake towel  its in here  okay ill come back later  for the cake plate  i still need my poopy shake at two  right  lisa honey your husbands car  was parked again in the driveway last night  i dont think he understands how  much of a problem this is  he came home so

womans hair is the gateway  to her sensuality  not the hair on her head honey  what do you think   i think you should try it on  no no its for you  thats not exactly my style  sweetie i say this with a heart full of love but your style could use a tiny shot of adrenaline  i like a classic look  try it just for fun  niiiice  i dont know isnt it a little trendy  are you kidding me its perfect  and 30 off  okay now try the gold silk number  im so psyched for valerie doane  her sculpture is amazing  you didnt hear shes not  coming this semester  what do you mean thats the whole  reason i took this course  yeah i know you and everybody but she got some kind of travel grant  so shes in israel and now we have  some other guy coming  that sucks this place is fucking lame  its just one class  i know but nothings turning out  to be as good as it looked in the catalog  whos this other guy  oliver something something  its olivier castro staal  hes supposed to be awesome  really cause i heard he was kind  of on his own trip  well valerie doane is incoherent  i took a seminar with her at bamf  it was garbage  was that him  this is the wrong room are you here for form in space  this is the right room  its supposed to be a studio class  the catalog said lecture   well thats bullshit  i dont do lectures so this  is going to be a studio class  if anyone needs a lecture for whatever  reason people have for these things then go now  i wont be offended  oh you can just talk  umi need a lecture to balance  out my course load  okay  were going to make art in this class  and in the end ill put lecture  on the forms for people who need lecture  and studio on the forms for people  who need studio and thats it  if this upsets your sense of order  then you can go now i wont be offended  but go now so we dont have to deal with  ambivalence in this room  ambivalence is poison for art  if i ever see anyone tormented  over some decision this way or that way  i will be offended and i will throw  you out for the sake of the class  good that was a bad vibe  okay there are no easels in this stupid  roomso everyone get on the floor  get on the floor  do you have your drawing pads  we thought this was a lecture class  take one and pass it  if you have a pencil youre lucky  if you only have a pen youre luckier  all right you have five minutes to draw  a picture of the day in your life  that was the most horrible  go  wait what do you mean   a picture of the day  go i said  she juiced yet  yeah just about  hey you file that certificate  claires gonna do it tomorrow  stupid kids  doesnt it seem like she really  sort of panicked though  maybe something happened to her before  i dont know  you know vanessa gets scared all the time  even when shes out with the kids  she gets it  ask lisa  im not sure lisa gets it that much  i mean she doesnt wear high heels  or tight skirts or anything  vanessa says she gets it even when  shes wearing her big fat sweatpants  but you know shes pretty hot  lisas hot  yeah l lisas hot i just  i dont want to talk about your wife like that  when does it stop sounding weird  that someones your wife  vanessa felt like my wife already  when we were 16 years old  hey listen nate  the first year of marriage for  most people is the hardest  especially with a baby on top too  that can be tough for anyone  its great  it is im totally into it  alright im just sayingyknow  even if sometimes youre not  thats normal  im into it  come in  are you feeling better  youre a little late with this  i had to go and get more psyllium  oh god the babys here  im sorry we havent quite figured out  the childcare thing  i tried to call nates mom but  i guess she was hurt when  i got so angry about the peanut butter  but it really could have made maya sick  sweetie im sorry you know i love  your little girl and nates fine  but i just i cant get into all this  okay lets talk about dinner  marlos assistant said she is  only eating raw foods at the moment  i really feelthat you are not  being sensitiveto me at all  im sorry i thought you wanted  to talk about dinner  god lisa i mean  ive obviously had a very difficult morning  and youre all about your own agenda  i didnt mean  youre rushing me through the menu  so you can go deal with your baby  shes fine i dont have to deal  with her at all right now  well i really felt it earlier  when i was in a lot of pain  but the baby was crying and that  was clearly your priority  no one was watching her  that is not my problem  when i hired you for this job  you were totally unencumbered  and now now theres nate and his dirty  car and theher and her needs and  nate and the baby have not  affected my cooking at all  they have affected your ability to  support me emotionally  and you live in my house  what do you suggest i do  put maya up for adoption  oh ive discussed this with my therapist  and shes very concerned by the way  that i allow you to treat me because  oh my god  i require and i fucking deserve  a lot more attention and you know what  i will not feel ashamed about that  if i had known you were hiring me  to be your fucking wet nurse  i wouldve asked for health insurance  where are you going lisa lisa  lisa goddammit  the moment was of when my friend oded  write down on a piece of paper  your favorite artist  in fact everyone do this  is it kandinsky  lets see  because youre using kandinskys language here its the same with most of these drawings  we despise ourselves so much that  we consider our own point of view as trivial  but thats bullshit  thats your father talking  or whatever bad teachers  you had before me  you with the red hair who did you write hopper  no i wrote modigliani  were you lying  no but i also wrote nan goldin  because im really more into photography  when did you see the hopper show at moca   last week  okay thats exactly what im saying  she sees 50 paintings by hopper  she starts to draw like him  because its easier than drawing  from the eye inside  yeah but artists get influenced by art  thats part of the process  until you locate the inside eye  its all bullshit  its like a coloring book  every work you make has to be  a surprise to the earth  a seeing that never happened before  because its what happens when  exactly what is inside of you  confronts exactly what is outside of you  okay next  definitely and the black suit  and the cocktail dress  oh im not buying anything   why not  nothing was perfect  nothing in life is perfect  well that makes it easy to  stay within a budget  if you dont buy this black suit  im gonna buy it for you  that is the sweetest thing ive ever heard but id just return it and give you the money  fine im gonna go back for the sandals  where did you find this  oh just leave that there theyll  take care of it for you  i know but it seems so rude  wonderful color for you  how much  too much  what are you doing  its one of my little pleasures  its only fair if theyre gonna charge  350 for a piece of fabric that costs 20 to make  they should lose a few do you want one  i certainly do not  it would be a great help to me if you  tried to look a little less suspicious  fortunately women our age are invisible  so we can really get away with murder  what  i dont want to go to this  stupid fiesta barbecue  oh come on itll be fun  whats fun about standing around a pool  with a bunch of straight people shaking maracas  theres gonna be a mariachi band  why cant there be just one other gay couple  some lesbians from the bay area  hey that kid in the pool was gay  the 11 year old  oh david relax youre letting  this matter too much  well im sorry but sometimes  i just get exhausted by the running commentary  in my head all day long about how to be  is this shirt too tight  is that gesture too flamboyant   who am i offending just by being here   maybe youre beyond all that but  i wouldve thought youd at least understand  it would just be nice on vacation  to not have to deal with that  so dont offend people who cares we paid for our room right  i cant just turn it on and off  well maybe you should try  no one gets a break from their  reality ya know  mexican food gives me the runs  and what about what frank said  it makes me feel like i have the runs  no about us being less isolated  im not doing a limbo contest   thats hawaiian  well good  but if there is one youd be a fool not to  enter it you know youd win that thing  it makes you look 20 get it  do i want to look 20  okay it makes you look 30  for 15 i could buy a bag of groceries  oh yeah but a bag of groceries  doesnt make you want to look at yourself  excuse me excuse me id like to get this  flirtation  let me see if we have  any left its very popular  we may be out  oh she found it  no no sorry wrong one keep looking  were all sold out  oh all right then thank you so much  bye  david salsa come on  well what do we want to do for dinner  go to that cheesy town  its just a bunch of outlet malls  and chain restaurants  the room service menu looked like heaven  good lets go  and if we dont have to drive  we can get really drunk  whats going on  i quit we have to move  whoa whoa whoawhat  i would rather live on the street  and beg for rice with a bowl  than spend one more night  under this roof  all right what what happened  she just unleashed so much  insanity at us  its not good for maya to be around  that kind of hostile dementia  if thats what id wanted for her  id be living with my mother  im not sure mayas really  that in touch with  shes very absorbent  okay  i kind of wish we could have talked  this through before you quit  did you actually quit  yes i actually quit we have to  leave tomorrow morning  so what were you thinking that  wed go stay at my moms i guess  well yeah for now  its not the worst thing that  could ever happen is it  no  its not the best thing  that ever happened either  im sorry i snapped  my humanity just rose up  come here  its alright  oh my god  these walls are like paper  so fucking what were on vacation dammit  yeah were gay in here  come on cowboy bring it on home wa hoo  were having some hot man on man love action  hallelujah hallelujah  hold it hold it hold it you sing i sing  baby everything is alrightuptight out of sigh  im a poor mans son from across the railroad tracks  the only shirt i have is hanging on my back  but im the envy of evry single guy  cause im the apple of my mans eye  he says baby everything is alright  oh youre losing your pillow  oh dammit  would you be careful  sorry  lisa youre carrying too much  its fine i just didnt  realize how tall it was  i dont know how much of  davids furniture you need  but he has some lovely pieces  stored in the garage  we dont really have anything  just that rocking chair  its a much better space than carols  its bigger  yeah theres no kitchen  i told lisa youre welcome to  cook in the house whenever youd like  thanks  it wont be for too long ruth  im happy to have you  ruth you can pick her up  thats nice lipstick mom  why thank you dear its new  when youre done put down your charcoal  okay this is it  can you see why this is good  because its in her own language  yes but the way i tell  if something is good is  does it make me want to throw up  this drawing instantly makes  me feel nauseous  you can tell if something is truthful even if you dont understand it if it affects your body  your liver and your bowels are more  important as an artist than your eyes  because they are so far  away from your brain  i dont know i think  it seems kind of obvious  because youre embarrassed by yourself  in the beginning if you hate  something its good  because you dont recognize  the beauty of your own truth  youre used to being a normal pathetic human  who does only what other people want  but what the other people really  want is to fuck you  and to make money off of you and to hang you  in the living room with the fancy security system  like this who did you make this to please  me your mother your boyfriend  does anyone feel sick from this  no so who the fuck cares  im a friend of callies  and i was there the nightshe died  i wanted to speak because i really loved her  and i wanted to talk about  who she was to meand to us  which is this brave brazen  totally heroic person  this rock climbing body surfing  back talking truth or dare champion  i never even once saw her scaredbefore  i guess what i really want to say to her is  we were just pretending to be this  thing that were not  i dont think and then she was this  thing that shes not  im sorry  but when she saw that it was us  she had this look like  how could this be you   mrs mortimer  im sorry but i just didnt know what to say  what  the mother mrs mortimer yknow i just i dont i didnt know what to say to her  you didnt really have to say anything i didnt  yeah but likehug her dont hug her yknow  i freeze up  you cant think about it you just have to  really be there with them justbe present  i dont think i can  sure you can  no downstairs yknow  its just a body  but up here like this young girl yknow  shes someones sister and someones daughter  and i cant help but to think  well what if it was julio  or vanessa even   yknow and i just cant  you dont ever think what if it  was maya what if it was lisa   i dont actually  not them  i cant bring them in here with me ya know  i just want them to be whats good about life that way i can come here and deal with what isnt  that way i can come here and deal with what isnt  well youre lucky then  so howd it go last night  awesome i mean we screwed up a lot  but no one noticed  it was fucking loud  everyone was walking around with like  cocktail napkins in their ears  so listen  i kind of want to talk about this whole  seeing other people thing  im not that into it  i meanit makes me feel weird  you know its like  if people are into each other  then that should be pretty much enough yknow  at some point yeah  what do you mean  like when it gets really serious or whatever  well when does that usually happen for you  it depends  okay well how about like  after a couple of months  you mean like us now  yeah  i dont know  i mean do you  well yeah thats what im saying  its just not really my thing  to like sleep around  im not sleeping around  i just mean im kind of a like  one at a time sexual person i think  sowhat do you think  i dont think im there  just not at this exact point in time  well why not is it cause you like  someone else better  no so totally not  its justit kind of has  to be more organic for me  like not some kind of contract or whatever  it has to evolve  but im not saying it wont  it so totally could  well not for me not when its like  you cant come hear me play because  theres some other girl thats gonna be there   yeah  sothats like it for you  i guess  well can i have a hug or something  no im just gonna go  hey what are you doing
