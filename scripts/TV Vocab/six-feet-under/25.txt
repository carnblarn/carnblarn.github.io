we can leave   keith i dont think  i dont want to hear it  because im white i couldnt possibly understand  because youll start spouting that child psychology bullshit youve been reading  its not bullshit its called the wholechild theory  and its only the collective thoughts of some of the greatest educators around okay  letting her know that we love her for who she is builds trust  constantly scolding her for behavior we dont like doesnt   i dont know how well raise a child  we just are okay  the board still hasnt cleared me on the shooting  were going to get the guardianship and were going to be good parents  taylor how long is it going to take you to brush your teeth  i would like to go on record as saying  i am in full support of you going to art school  consider it recorded  but im just taking a tour  lets not get our panties in a wad over it  thats such an unpleasant expression  i never got to go to college   did you even want to  i did   i wanted to study french feminist writers  youre a feminist mom  feminism means being accepted for who you are  i wanted to be a wife and a mother  i never gave anything up to be a mother or a wife it was what i wanted  i thought you said you gave up college   why is every conversation with you a trap  sorry im sorry  be a feminist we can both be feminists  check it out cindy sherman went here   and billy chenowith i never knew that  brendas brother   the one in the mental institution  hes out   is he cured  who knows  god i hate my hair  when i go to college im gonna cut it all off like felicity  have i met her  yeah she was here for dinner once  federico are you all right  yeah im fine david  you know her  abuelita it means grandma   federico im so sorry  no shes not really my grandma  shes sort of adopted  she lived by herself right across the street from me and vanessa before we moved  i used to clean the leaves out of her gutters  and bring her trashcans back up the driveway  i mean nothing big just when i was doing mine  we used to invite her to all the kids birthday parties  she used to sit in this folding chair  just happy to be there with a big smile on her face  thats sweet   is that the preneed she and i did together  yeah  is this a new rule wear pajamas to work  sorry i live at keiths now i dont know where half my stuff is  what  she wants the our lady of guadalupe casket i love that one  listen we heard back from the useofforce review board about your shooting  im sorry to be the one to have to tell you this  but youre being brought up on charges  turns out all the perp had was a toy pistol  theres evidence to suggest that if the perp hadnt died  he might have invented a cleanburning alternative to fossil fuels  reducing our dependence on imported energy sources  thus ending the conflict in the middle east  and deflecting the horror of the impending world war  its good  they decided it was a good shooting  thank you  congratulations  well the board ruled im off the hook  thank god   ill talk to you later  love you bye  claire fisher   howd you know  you dont look like a mujadeep siddiqui  im henry ill be your cruise director   excellent  lets go  so let me guess you were like the one total weirdo outcast at your high school  not the only one but definitely one of the top ten  i think thats what all of us are  i think every last freak of every last california high school winds up here  were kind of the island of misfit toys of colleges   can anyone take welding  you have to its a requirement  how cool that welding is a requirement not fucking calculus  nobodyll be looking at my math grades to get in here  even though you dont need the grades  you gotta make sure you rock the application thing   yeah definitely  no seriously  a lot of people want to go to school here so its not like a sleepwalk to get in  your essay your portfolio all that stuff counts  letters of recommendation   who do you know  nobody   i sort of know billy chenowith  hes okay  i think everything he does gregory crewdson did better except years ago  but the alumni thing should work in your favor   this ones called the jesus balls  first year student  no thats fine we dont have to go out tonight  okay  although we did decide that we would get together every other night  but this is actually better because now we can go out saturday  then monday wednesday and friday of next week  wait  then we cant be together next saturday  so truth be told every other day isnt a workable plan  i think we should decide on a number of days of a week  say three days a week or four days a week   three days a week  right or four days a week  and then choose those four days  always making sure we include saturdays  because who wants to stay alone on a saturday right  whatever you decide  nikolai dont let me talk you into something you dont want to do  no is fine  good let me go look at a calendar  so tell me everything  what does the human frymaster look like  the crematory  its a big steel thing in a big room  how does it work exactly  the container is placed on these chrome rollers  then a small door raises and the body goes through  like how your tray disappears through that thing in the cafeteria  yeah  actually its just like that  and then  and then once the body is in there theres a button thats pressed  sounds good  even though the good rabbi said i shouldnt just burn me up   who pushes the button  whomever you specify  buddhists have a family member some people choose no one  in which case the person at the crematory does it  ill take that guy  i guess ill be on my own at that point though  what about family members your parents  they just got to be total downers i told them to stop coming  theyll find out im dead when the rest of the world does   got any other friends  yeah i had some  a lot of work you know  a lot of people freak out when you get sick and a bunch of people betrayed me  some people just got too crazy to deal with   what about a girlfriend  no  i mean yeah i had girlfriends  relationships  but id be in something for whatever like two months two years  and then it would just get too  nothing just too  id start thinking i dont like this about her and i dont like this about her  then id start to feel this thing on the back of my neck  like one of those superballs and it would throb with the word  leave leave leave and so i would  and the second i got my life back the ball would disappear  i suffer from that american thing big time  you know always looking around for someone better shopping   i think a lot of people go through that  no they dont man  okay they dont most people just pick someone  i never looked at someone and just said okay ill take you  you can still connect with people  no i cant  its too late

what a soul twin is  soul mates arent enough i have to have a soul twin now  great more fucking propaganda  brenda soul twin only means  that your father and i made an agreement in another world  to

lifetime of being blocked ive finally discovered my spirituality  great someone whos completely not in touch with herself  now has a whole new vocabulary to not be in touch with herself with  i dont

be just a moment  oh my god  149000 babe  thats like 150000  jeez all i did was clean her gutters sometimes  and all i did was give you some pasteles to bring to her   why would she leave all of this

divinity  all the joy ive brought you and the pain ive caused  and still you hold me in your gaze undaunted by what love demands of us  you give me strength to see you  only you now and forever  and

grade  math is fun  really  and recess   shes good at so much  yeah she sure is  so would you say you two have a parenting style  weve been reading a lot about the wholechild theory  although we definitely like to mix in a little common sense  how so  we certainly believe in setting limits but we try not to be too rigid  i think that should just about do it  thank you for coming mr sherman sir  ill need to have a conversation with your supervisors about your work and so forth  im my own supervisor im a business owner  and as my supervisor id like to say  that david fisher is a great person and great to work with  my supervisor is sgt potts northeast division  ill phone him tomorrow  ill let myself out   whered you get your coffee table  restoration hardware  god dont you just

was sweet  youre joking  i kind of bought it  i mean look at the two of them   who else would have either one of them  well yeah  and they recognize that  for better or worse they accept each other  for better or for worse  by worse do you mean all the people they randomly fucked  stop  please  theyre our parents bren  it cant be good for us to talk about mom and dad like that   i crossed the line  its the way weve always been  its our family ethos i understand why you go there  but i dont want to talk that way anymore  i dont think we have to perpetuate the negativity  god what happened to you  cant we just celebrate this is a celebration right  yeah whoopee  your vows were really really moving  i hope my ceremony with brenda can be that heartfelt  what we have now  is based on real honesty  and forgiveness  that woman sees me always has   she knew you were with another woman  many many other women   past tense  wow  and she not only dealt with the jealousy   but she even renewed your vows with you  her idea  so i sold the house moved in  i say if life offers you a new beginning take it  thank god you know  i cant believe i fell into that midlife crisis trap  god what a fool a man will make of himself for some new pussy huh  to growing up  she forgave me  thank god you know  are we even moving  you forgot to push the button  the manner in which she opens her heart to a moment of visual truth inspires me  i am simply amazed at the depth  of claire fishers artistic clairvoyance  and as a lacarts alumnus  it is with great pleasure that i highly recommend her for your program  thank you   you made up a lot of really cool shit  all true  i still need to get two more letters  this guy who works in my trader joes had one of his collages in a show at moca   i could ask
