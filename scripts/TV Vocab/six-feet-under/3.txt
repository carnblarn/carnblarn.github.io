really  yeah  my dad had all these old bigband records  it always reminds me of  i dont know being a kid  still being blissfully ignorant about what a sick joke life can be  i wouldve pegged you as more of a fan of  what sting  u2 you know grew up in the 80s but too straight to be into the really  hardcore punk stuff  oh yeah  i suppose you were into the hardcore punk stuff  i think it was just the heroin talking  oh man i love that look  no i really should go  mom and david and i are having some sort of family meeting  to discuss whether we should sell the business to kroehner  god i hope we will  why  so that i can get the hell out of here and go back to seattle  why dont you come with me  why on earth would i do something like that  because you are my woman   youre out of your mind

all have problems  this oat bran is stuck on here like cement  because you didnt soak any water in it  listen to me kroehner is pressuring our suppliers  to demand money upfront  now continental caskets wants us to pay  for anything we put in the show room before we sell it  thats thousands of dollars  your father never let these things get to him like you do  he never had to deal with this kind of situation  im sure things will work out they always do   no they dont  good morning  whats going on with you  nothing  youre not leaving here until you put some food in your stomach  im starving  are you bulimic is that what were going to have to deal with now  mom apparently you want a child with an eating disorder  morning  how was your run  i havent gone yet i stayed over at brendas last night  no one cares where you were  why do you have to tell people every single thing you do  sorry i forgot were all supposed to live under a shroud of secrecy  so i think we should sell  im not saying that just because i dont want anything to do with this business  have you looked at their offer a lot of money stock options  do you have any idea how arrogant you are  you dont get to decide what were doing  i own half dave  you havent spent the last  you didnt give up anything for this  is this really what you want  or are you trying to make a dead man happy  we should have this conversation later   why cant she be a part of this  thank you  nate this is all i know  stay and run the place for kroehner go to law school like you wanted  take my trust fund ill take the cash  i think nates right  who knows how long any of us has left we should do what makes us happy  fine sell what do i care   you mean it  sure  lets just invalidate my entire life  ill go to gilardi today and tell him our decision  oh i dont know i guess the one with the satin interior  ma there were five with satin interior lets just go with the classic regal   i liked the white pearl  the classic regal will be fine  who cares anyway  my tommy was cut up into 50 pieces by a big giant dough mixer  oh ma pop wasnt in that many pieces  ma hes gonna look just as you remember him right  it says in your brochure you have a gifted restorative artist whatever  can he make sure pop look good enough for an open casket or not  because you know well go elsewhere  youll be completely satisfied with our

shit but hes your partner now right   hes like in a lot of pieces  humpty dumpty i know  careful that could be his head   jesus  or his pelvis  its probably his head   what happened to rico he get canned  no hes just busy  you new over there  no im just a temp  i heard old man fisher kicked you know him  not really  hey no offense pal you might want to call your agency  and ask for a new assignment  im already on it  hey gabe i looked for you in the quad this morning but i didnt see you so  maybe you stayed home because you were tired or something but  anyway i just wanted to let you know i was thinking about you and  not in any serious way i was just thinking about you casually  okay bye  i wanna kill myself  hey morticia  foot slut  its such a fucking easy decision for him  and then mom takes his side big surprise  its like i dont even exist  like me giving up law school meant nothing  so fight if you really want to keep the business dont give it away  see thats just it all day long ive been feeling this incredible sense of  relief  i dont know if i want to keep it i could do anything im still young   right  are you kidding youre still a baby  what about that one  thats a little mayberry for me  something simple and clean  like the ones that hang in a deserted truck stop  when that handsome drifter blows into town  of course  what about that one  not bad  i could see ava gardner lying beneath it  plotting to steal clark gable from grace kelly  people start their lives over all the time right   that guy just cruised you  really  bitch  right in front of me like im not even here  he did  and i missed it  oh sorry   oh ruth  amelia  another casserole  lemon bars  the kids will love them  dont you have candy striping today  i did but i told them my best friend needed me   youve made the right decision  i know  i never realized how much money there was to be made in the funeral business  deathcare industry  and its only gonna grow with all the baby boomers and all   gee there will be bodies everywhere  hopefully  and all in final resting places provided by kroehner  with a little help from fisher  sons  you know weve had our eyes on your operation for some time  your father was a nice guy but he didnt know how to run a business  well my dad was never in it for the money  i think he was more concerned about you know helping people  you wanna help people join the peace corps   yeah  greedy little nazi fuck  so how exactly will this work  we wont change the appearance of your unit at all  maybe a little cosmetic upgrading perhaps  but preparation of loved ones will now take place  at a centralized location which services several other units  technicians on staff constantly producing  so its like a little factory of embalming  preparation for visitation   we maintain a small fleet of vehicles  hearses   funeral carriages  dead wagons  removal vans  once you centralize operations youd be amazed how you maximize profits  so in the end were all just human mcnuggets  just as we began  i like you nate  you hear that buddyboy he likes you  wow you are so cool  your initial payment sir  the rest will follow after both our lawyers have held up the process  iong enough to justify their fees  in the meantime wed like to send a facilities inspector out to  take a look at things as early as next week  you know like the president   ill see you later  yeah all right later  hey  whats going on  you fucking asshole  why is my car covered with words like toe sucker  i i dont know l  you didnt for instance blab to your friends that you bagged me  and that i sucked your toes  i might have told one person  andy he just he asked me what i did the night before so i told him i mean  its not like i thought this was gonna work out  because i know nothing ever works out  but i guess i just wanted to enjoy this for a little bit  instead the whole worlds calling me this little piggy lover  im sorry  i mean come on so what   so it got out who cares  know what i wish  i wish that just once people wouldnt act like the cliches that they are  this can go to goodwill  and this  and this one too  maybe nathaniels clothes are too dull for goodwill   does goodwill ever refuse anything  ruth if you want to cry cry   what are you talking about  just let it out thats why im here  for the last time im fine  i just think its very interesting youre supposed to be making two piles  one for goodwill and one for memories  and yet you have not held on to one thing  the memory pile was your stupid idea  what can i do with nathaniels old clothes  make pillows a quilt i ought to just burn them all  how can someone with so little clothing have so much clothing  what is this  nothing  its stupid  something about visiting the pyramids taking ballet lessons  i wrote down things i might want to do now that im   i have more time  well i think thats wonderful  no its not  its stupid i dont even want to do any of these things  i just did it because some book told me to   what am i gonna be in swan lake  why not  you see stories like that on the news all the time its inspiring  its depressing it seems so desperate  maybe its a little desperate  besides who knows  its always possible you might meet a man  that part of my life is over  youre supposed to flip this mattress every two months  i do mine every 14 weeks  well i cant remember ever flipping this its probably been 20 years  come on get up  you havent finished going through nathaniels clothes  ruth  ruth how can i help you  you can lift this up with me  an uncovered mattress is so sad  help me turn this over  all right  okay  all right  does it feel any different  no  save our park  save our park save our park  save our park save our park  no more money for politicians money for parks  save our park save our park  what are you doing  you have a gift you can help people  fine  go back to peddling soy milk and nailing waitresses  what do i care im dead  move it asshole  save our park save our park  so now you dont want to sell   i know it sounds crazy  no not at all  well keep the business for the rest of the day then sell it again tomorrow   hear me out  this is a good system  well sell in the mornings keep it in the afternoons  sometimes we sell again in the evenings when we cant make a decision  david youre not being fair  when i didnt want to sell you couldve cared less  when nate doesnt you listen  okay im a terrible mother whos responsible for all your problems happy  so you had some revelation and now you wanna be a funeral director   how long is that going to last  he does have a point nate   you dont always stick with things  you cant be in the same room  with a dead body  i know but theres a reason for that  this is what im supposed to do  which is why ive spent so much time running away from it  my whole life ive been a tourist  now i have the chance to do some good instead of just sucking up air  i know its a lot to ask of you i know but i just really think that we can do this  you and me together  brothers  like we used to be  we could still sell to kroehner and both manage fisher  sons  yeah but then were just spokesmodels  working to make fat republican stockholders richer  kroehner doesnt give a shit about people we care   we can help them through their grief  this is a business nate not a charity  of course its a business but  its more than that and you know it  okay  great  ill call gilardi and tell him he can kiss our collective ass  language  maybe dad knew what he was doing  you did not have to waste this stuff on me  oh please my parents got a case of it  from some tv movie they were technical advisors on  some serialkiller thing for cable  oh theyre such whores theyll do anything  gosh  can you believe this stuff is expensive  you know ive always wanted to tell off some corporate suit some  greedy little nazi fuck you know  thats very hostile  no i was very diplomatic i just said thanks but we changed our minds  what did he do  he didnt do anything whats he gonna do   this is completely unacceptable  the baxters changed their mind   theyre going with the unger mortuary  was there a reason  they probably just underbid you  hal unger never underbid anybody  he moved to florida they were bought out by kroehner months ago  sign here  you know  i didnt just decide to stay in los angeles because of the business   i had another reason  oh please dont ruin this   ive got such a nice buzz going  it was you  nate get serious   its true  no its not  youre staying here because you found something you want to do  i am the extra bonus that probably wont work out  sometimes your honesty gets really tiresome   i dont want any children  who said anything about children  i was referring to you  i got something for you  open it  glenn miller orchestra at the hollywood palladium  brenda this is so cool ive never been to the palladium  you grew up in la and youve never been to the palladium pathetic  these are for three weeks from now  howd you know i wouldnt be in seattle  i didnt  morning rico  just what i need another boss breathing down my neck  put me to work  hello  pregnancys kicked vanessas hormones into overload i gotta talk her down  if you wanna help take mr romano out of the bag and put him on the table  remember breathe through your mouth man hes pretty ripe  oh christ   nate  great look what you made me do  oh gross  i want to talk to you about something  i dont know if you noticed but im a little busy swimming in a mans guts  i dont know what this is  im picking up a part of a person and i dont even know what part it is  fine ill talk to you later  oh god  sorry  what the hell are you doing  i work here now i have to be a part of things  let rico take care of him  i have a job for you thats much better suited to your particular talents  morning nate lovely day isnt it  ive seen better  i only wanted to say hello seeing that im your new neighbor  we just bought that house across the street  got it for a song too  oh and by the way were planning to put you out of business in six months  theyre opening a poseidon society across the street  thats right  what is a poseidon society  they sell cremations cheap cremations now for a fraction of what we charge  you can dump off the relative you never really liked  at the torch mart across the street  i guess we have to just continue to do our best  and how exactly do we do that  you know lou the florist that sweet old guy  he just upped what he charges us by 200 percent  and that chemical dealer on figueroa is now suing us  over some nonexistent shipment of cavity fluid  every other supplier that we have in common with kroehner  suddenly developed some problem with fisher  sons  for some reason by the name of kroehner  the health department is going to inspect us next week  yeah so what isnt everything clean  yes but any inspection means we have to update something  if its the ventilation system were sunk  we shouldve sold  nate im having a problem  you dont happen to have mr romanos foot on you do you  do you remember picking up the foot  i think so but my eyes were shut and i was trying not to vomit  im not happy  well thats very interesting david because im ecstatic  maybe the morgue never gave us that foot  both feet are listed in the paperwork nate  just think nate is there any other point you couldve lost it   lost what  nothing  if you lost something look under the bed thats where things always turn up   i doubt that applies in this case  thats what people always say  then they find what theyre looking for under the bed   mom were really busy down here  the upstairs machine is broken  i called the repairman but  oh my god what is this  someone left a kleenex in their pocket and now its all over everything  its disgusting  nate retrace your steps  is there any other point you couldve lost the foot  i almost dropped him at the morgue but the bag didnt open  i tripped on the stairs but nothing fell out  banged into the freezer spilled him onto the floor   and i picked him up from off the floor  it should be here  id say its an 8 million lawsuit  at least   here she comes  like my new shoes theyre size 12  toe slut  amelia  its me ruth  your best friend needs help  is he all put together   oh hes 100 percent there  absolutely  id like to see him  im sorry our embalmer is a little on the artistic side  he gets crazy if he has any input  its best to wait until were completely done  one more thing  his shoes   what are you an idiot  those are his favorite shoes  he has perfectly comfortable loafers which would be much more appropriate  yes i myself have loafers which are just like walking on air  we shouldve just told her the truth  sorry mrs romano but my idiot of a brother lost a part of your husband  yeah that wouldve worked  where are you going  i have someplace i have to be  when i return i hope to be greeted by a foot  a solution as to how to stop a billiondollar corporation  from putting us out of business and pruned hedges   arent you glad youre out of the house  yes this is just what i needed  we should try and get a seat right in front   im placing a bet  we should just try and enjoy the day  i dont see why we need to gamble  thats sweet  you both look so happy  its just an act  just enjoy it while it lasts which isnt very long  excuse me  you think you have forever but you dont  soon you start to get on each others nerves  then you dont tell the other person as much as you used to  whats the point you thought they understood you   but they never did not really  ruth  finally not only do you not tell him anything real  you actively start lying to him  then when you think it cant get any worse he up and dies   i think i see a shorter line over there  bye  no matter what you do you end up alone  not knowing who you are or what you really want  ruth ruth why did we come here today  to have fun arent you having fun  i think its wobbling  it just looks like its wobbling because youve been staring at it for so long  its definitely wobbling  youre hallucinating  life is strange  if one of those tiny screws isnt screwed on tight enough  that thing could fall and kill us instantaneously  just chop us to bits like a cuisinart  and an assassin with a semiautomatic could walk through the door  and spray our brains all over the place  the sun could become a supernova and engulf the entire planet in flames  david fisher  we just got a call from claires school shes in trouble   cant mom handle this  shes mia  and besides i think you might be interested in what they told me  what start from the beginning  jesus  okay ill be right there until then tell nate to  oh great hes mia too  all right bye  theres a rumor going around school that my sister put a dismembered foot  into some boys locker  shut the fuck up  she did it i know she did  wheres the foot now  i dont know the student who found it  denies that it ever happened  okay wheres your sister  no one knows a police report has been filed  and now mom is supposed to meet with the principal  i dont

going through  sure as much as i can given weve known each other less than a month  theres no big investment i mean thats part of the appeal for both of us  right  right  jeannie fritzen tried to kiss me in this room i wouldnt let her   you cant control things nobody can  shut up  theres only one thing thats certain   everything changes  shut up  i already talked to the cops  i dont understand why i have to go through this again   because this time i want the truth  man  a witness already said she saw you running down the hall  screaming the crazy funeralhome girl put a foot in your locker  it was a joke it was just a joke  shes kind of a loser and we all pick on her   she totally asks for it  modern technology is really something   i dont care man  you should  we have chemicals we put on your hands to see if youve touched human remains  no way  you want to tell me what really happened today  l  whos that  thats my partner  you better be glad you dont have to mess with him  that guys into some crazyass shit  now either you can tell me where you put the foot  or youre gonna be dealing with that crazyass motherfucker  big shirley by a nose  she won  oh god i just cant believe it i won  16  i told you this would be fun   how much did you win  i dont know   four thousand  four thousand what  dollars  and by the way i had an affair with a hairdresser last year   you did  yep  are you a cup how many cups are you  im a loaf of bread  hello  okay talk slowly  im gonna see you in a few hours  slow down slower  well youre gonna have to wait   because you have to  brenda  just stay there ill call you in a halfhour   promise  i promise   who was that  nothing to worry about   i gotta go  brenda who was it  just someone else okay just back off  i cant deal with this right now ill call you  im glad youre staying in town   he threw it out of his car  he was taking it to show some friends  then it hit him he might get in trouble  what with people not supposed to be in possession of others feet   he tossed it out  ive gotta get home  just drop me off and ill pick up my car later  all right ill take a look where he said he tossed it   you dont have to do that  hey how can i sleep  knowing that theres a foot on the loose   you lost 25000 its just gone  i suppose it still exists  its just not mine anymore   im waiting for an explanation  dont talk to me like a child  i was on a  what do you call it a roll  so i kept betting more and more and i just felt so good  like i was living someone elses life i was up 9000  and then i started to lose  and then i started to feel like me again and so i kept betting more and more  and losing more and more  you shouldve been more careful  i dont want to be careful i want to feel alive  there should be a way to do that thats a little less expensive  i have a right to make mistakes nate  you of all people shouldnt begrudge me that  what  i lost 25000 okay you got it out of me now leave me alone  hey  claire   youre davids friend  keith  whats going on  not much  so wheres claire now  i gotta say im totally relieved that i didnt lose it  hey  nice job rico   thank you  boy they did do a marvelous job  they ought to they charged a fortune  can i assist you miss romano  i know its silly  but i just wanted to see with my own eyes that pops all put together right  we get to do that dont we  okay good  i think ill be able to sleep much better now   rico you gave him a foot  yeah yeah  i thought it was for the best  remember that leg of lamb that your mother had  in the back of her freezer for forever  okay stop  embalmed wrapped in latex and duct tape  i was following him home to get it back when i saw him toss it  now ive been here for hours and i cant find it   describe it to me again  its a foot  why did you take it in the first place  well at the time it seemed like a good way to pay him back for something  i just wanted to shake him up  i dont understand how guys can be so unshakable  i know what you mean  did you ever suck a guys toe  yeah  me too  have you been watching mrs romano  yeah  been watching her all night  are you thinking what im thinking  casket climber  her she doesnt look that energetic  yeah those are the ones that really go for it  so we should probably have a conversation with rico  about whats going on with kroehner  okay  so there was no baby christening the other day i lied  but i only took one meeting with gilardi   you met with him why  hey gilardi called me okay  i have the right to consider my options  my father put you through mortuary school   i wanna go with you  mrs romano mrs romano   its okay  mommy  grab her legs its okay its okay here we go   here we go mrs romano  im sorry  i give up  its not here  this probably isnt over  if theres a lesson to be learned its that your actions have consequences  yeah well gabe should learn that  i know you and my brother are like  gay  okay  what do you see in him   hes just david you know  i know thats why im asking  he is smart hes kind hes funny  i know he can be a little uptight but underneath that hes  such a little boy innocent  and i like that  most of the men i meet well  they kind of just want me to be one thing  what like big black sex cop  sorry i was speeding officer i guess youll have to punish me now  yeah  and i dont want to be that rent a video  david  he gets me  when someone sees you as you really are and wants to be with you  thats powerful  whatever  i wish i could know the david you know  you could be a little nicer to him  hes under a lot of stress  with that cremation place opening across the street  what cremation place  she stole a foot  from a person  yes would it have been better if it was an animals  a little bit  you wake up one day and your babys stolen a foot   where have i been  losing 25000  hey  okay ive had a long day  oh david i ran into your friend keith   whos keith  you met at dads thing   i never met a keith  yes you did the cop  i asked him to help out  hell see what he can do about there not being an official report  why does this person have to be so involved in our life  claire we should probably talk about getting you some help  you are not my father  if you need a project get a dog  keith says the schools probably gonna make me see a shrink anyway  oh dear  by the way that house across the street  its on fire  i guess this should solve all your problems  freckles  freckles  here girl  freckles
