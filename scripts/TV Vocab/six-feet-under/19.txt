the end of the year  youre new here arent you  yeah about six months  id start sending out my rsum now  unless youre one of parkinsons fucking inner circle  if you are then  fuck me right   do you wanna go and get another drink  please  excuse me i guess im the asshole  for telling the fucking truth  shit  thats not fair  you suck   morning  god you scared me   youre up early  i slept like a fucking baby   yeah me too  after the night we had  the sheer exhaustion factor alone  yeah i gotta say it was worth the wait   so does this mean the ebb is over  for now  want a coffee   wow this is kind of racy  hey no   is that your novel  i dont know what it is yet   when do i get to read it  when its ready if its ever ready  well whos christina is that your fictional alter ego  your holden caulfield  shes more like my humbert humbert  you know my constance chatterley  shes like hermione in the harry potter books  what would you rather have  some overlyeducated gasbag like trevor  or a semiliterate fuck machine like me come on  thats a nobrainer no pun intended  i have something for you  i know its small but it is a diamond  you think i care about diamonds  will you marry me brenda chenowith  havent we done this already   what  i love you  good  something else  i thought we could announce it to my family at dinner tonight  i was gonna ask my mom to make dinner  look we have to do this sometime   and what about your family  are you kidding  they are way too consumed in their own divorce drama to even notice  lets just not tell them and say that we did  and what about billy  you know i havent really talked to him for a while  why dont i make you pancakes from scratch  like a good little wifetobe  before i fuck your brains out and send you to work  how about we skip the pancakes  shit youre already dressed am i holding you up  no not really   well maybe a little  youve got the best shower  mines just this weird bolt sticking out of the wall that sends out mist  it takes five minutes just to get wet  how come i always stay here its time for you to stay at my place   after that great recommendation  its nice  mgm built it back in the 30s to house starlets  great parquet floors unbelievable molding  but some idiot did an 80s retrofit and ripped out all the good fixtures  ill be happy to stay at your house fixtures aside  you know i never thought youd call me back after that second date  why  because i never think the good guys are gonna call back  who said im a good guy  well its been three weeks thats usually a sign  check with me in three months ill tell you how youre doing  good morning sit have some breakfast   most important meal of the day  good morning dear  apparently  how would you like your eggs  surprise me  now this is good yeah all together for breakfast  well i see its good neighbor day at the fisher house  david was that a new friend i saw leaving this morning   mom please id rather not discuss  what does he do  hes a public defender  you should have asked him in for breakfast wed all like to meet him  yes bring him next time i would like to meet him  wheres nate we have an intake in 15 minutes  he called from the car there was an accident on the 10  and he told me to ask everyone to be here for dinner tonight  he has something important to tell us  a big family dinner  it will be fun  everybody had gotten off  and the lights were on  you could see what a dumpy little boat it actually was  and he just wasnt there   its hard to believe right now but time  i got dumped at a party in college once  it was the kappa sig luau  by some guy whose name i dont even remember  the sun was coming up and i just  sat there staring at this stupid pig carcass  in my stupid hawaiianprint sundress  mrs collins have you thought about  matthew and i had been married for almost 20 years  can you believe that  i met him when i was barely 20  and now hes dead  and im just that much closer to it  im sorry we dont allow smoking inside  please put that out its against california state law we could be fined  sorry  how long will it take  it depends on the kind of service you were thinking of  length of visitation should you choose an open casket  my husband was dredged up from long beach harbor  with a propeller slice halfway down his body  closed casket then  how much i cant spend a lot of money  were probably looking at around 7000  that seems like a lot  its about average maybe a little less  well take care of everything  make it as easy on you as possible  i need to think about this   of course let us know what you decide  i can show myself out   shopping around for the best deal  isnt that her right  shes wasting our time  oh dear when did you get so dried out you must be thirsty  the flowers are lovely sarah thank you  i just cut them on my walk through the canyon  dont worry you didnt put me out one bit  this kitchen is exactly the same  yes it is  you look well   so do you  i only just got your messages  i was in madrid  i wanted to stay through christmas but i ran out of money  the reason i was calling was because  what i want to say was that  i forgive you  youre the only family apart from the children that i have left  i didnt want more time to go by with our not talking  were sisters we shouldnt be estranged  i took this course called the plan  you did the plan youre shitting me  that is so great ruth you of all people   whats that supposed to mean  no its very brave  i know it couldnt have been easy for you i did it back in the 70s  when it was still called transitional focus  before ernst vollhoffer was busted for tax evasion  and sold it to the canadians  thats when it became the plan  i met vollhoffer at a party once  and he came on to me  but id just dropped acid for the first time  and i thought he was some mayan death priest  who wanted to cut out my heart and throw it into a pit  so i blew him off  catherine collins has decided to go with the unger mortuary  well i guess thats that  unger is a kroehner home nate  yeah so  so kroehner charges about double what we do  thats the third funeral kroehner has stolen from us  since mitzi huntley came to visit they are after us again  look now youre just being dramatic  this from a man who basically lives in denial  look stan told me at lunch last week that kroehner stock had taken a nosedive  why would they be wasting their time with small potatoes like us  maybe because you told mitzi to shove her goodfaith gesture up her ass  i told you guys that kroehner wasnt gonna let up but nobody listens to me  not now federico we needed that funeral  how else are we paying for the fine from the dca  thats 1800 we dont have right now  i asked you to check the proof  no license number on a billboard opposite a retirement home  makes us look like amateurs we cannot afford to be vulnerable  im not comfortable starting on this womans perm until i have a photo  any idea when thats supposed to arrive  i have an inspector coming to my house this afternoon  it came in this morning and i put it in her file  which you would know if you bothered to look  im calling catherine and im going to lowball unger  even if we cut our profits in half we can show kroehner were willing to fight  hey mom  hello  who are you  im your aunt sarah  claire the goddess is clearly manifesting through you   its very obvious  thanks  i thought you were dead  the skin like milk treasure it while it lasts  ruth you told your daughter i was dead  shame on you  i never told her any such thing  claire why would you lie about that  whenever you talked about her it just sounded like she was dead  i just assumed  well ive made a miraculous recovery  tell me exactly what you were feeling when you made this   boredom  liar  theres anger and yearning  passion resentment of the status quo some jealousy of it as well  not the most original perspective but its authentic  i love this  the technique very precise very adult  the death of romance in a regimented artificial world  lovely  actually i found it in the garbage  my dad threw it out after a funeral i thought it looked cool so i kept it  youre an artist claire   please  im not saying youre any good yet  but if you focus and live fully you could become something  if youre lucky and dont selfdestruct   right  youve got an eye  you see through the veil  its a blessing and a curse  okay  you need something red in your relationship corner  like a red velvet pillow  something bordelloey  youre resisting the carnal thats your mother rubbing off on you  put a plant in your knowledge corner if you want to grow into your potential  what is that feng shui youre kidding right  you can drop the generic apathy crap  thats just laziness youre more than that and you know it  hey baby sorry im late  rico we are fucked  its definitely mold  i told you so see this is why julios cold dont get any better  maybe youve got structural damage in your chimney  and waters leaking in when the rain starts itll get worse  okay what can we do  i got to rip this all out and see whats going on inside  maybe we can patch things up maybe itll be bigger than that   how much is it all gonna cost  you got serious water damage here  it could be anywhere from 3000 to maybe 7000 if your roof is involved  excuse me one second   we can get ramon to fix it  fix it  he didnt even spot it you heard him theres serious water damage   any idiot would know that  dont call my cousin an idiot  okay no ill call you an idiot  because you were too cheap to get a real inspector initially  im an idiot  maybe it wasnt the smartest idea to go to your sister  and buy this pieceofshit house behind my back now you think about that   god damn it  what happened  i just got snapped running a red light  we are living in a motherfucking police state i tell you what  any calls while i was at lunch  the unger mortuary called to say the funeral we poached from fisher  sons   is going back to them  youre kidding  we undercut them by almost 500  well now theyve undercut us by nearly 1000  oh my god i love this  theyre cute but they are such bad businessmen  well they wont last  what have i got tomorrow  your trainer at 900  then backtoback performance reviews from 100 to 500  cancel everything except the trainer  all right  i think i need to spend a little quality time with the fabulous fisher boys   ruth do you have any tarragon  all the spices are in that cabinet  well now i know what to get you for christmas  dean  deluca have these fantastic spices in test tubes  very mad scientist youll love them   what are you making  im not sure yet  im making chicken kiev  i bought all the ingredients to make chicken kiev  so well make chicken kiev  have tarragon will travel  tarragon is not listed in the ingredients  following instructions wheres the creativity in that  cooking is alchemy not a science  it is if you want it to turn out right  is there anything i can do to help  smell  this vodka is from poland you will like it  ruthie why dont you join us  thank you but ill wait till dinner is served to have a glass of wine  okay suit yourself  where you learning to speak the russian  its a long story lets just say there was a man involved  of course there was  claire when you are finished mixing the herbs in  you want to form the butter into little logs eight of them  no not at all its deliciously sensual  wash your hands first claire  you wild woman  nikolai is adorable and hot  the sex must be spectacular good for you  oh my god  youre all grown up but your face is still 12 years old  david you remember your aunt sarah  yes hi  im sure you couldnt forget her if you tried   david have some vodka  yes  this is so surreal  the engagement dinner  i feel like im in a training movie from the 50s about how normal people behave  well my familys anything but normal  compared to mine theyre the fucking cleavers  just relax and enjoy yourself all right you look gorgeous   everybody loves you  not your mother  all you have to do is sit back  and be the center of attention all right come on  so linda what do you do   its brenda  forgive me im drunk  its all nikolais fault  hes been plying me with vodka since the moment he arrived  im a massage therapist  shes an amazing massage therapist and shes writing a novel  you are  im writing something well see what it turns into  have you ever read charlotte light and dark   yes  well shes charlotte   i didnt know that  what is this charlotte light and who  its this book about this girl whos being analyzed  and shes smarter than the people who are analyzing her  and so shes constantly fucking with them its hilarious  you continue to be drawn to strong complex women bravo  mom this dinner is delicious  i think its a little sour myself   no its one of the best youve ever made  its great   here more vodka  please  i had a lover who was russian  he once told me  that vodka was to russians what therapy is to americans  something habitforming and expensive  that totally destroys your ability to lead an authentic life  sorry both my parents are shrinks  and that was very painful for you  but if it werent for that you probably wouldnt be writing your novel right  speaking of creativity is everyone aware of the budding artist in the family   no who  you havent seen claires work  shame on you she needs feedback  even if its just so she can learn to ignore it  claire i know so many creative people from all over the world  you must come stay with me in topanga canyon and meet some of them  okay  what  nows as good a time as any i guess  the reason that i wanted us all to get together for dinner tonight  is that brenda and i have decided to get married  good married this calls for a toast yes  absolutely  there you go something to toast with  to romantic love  both the inspiration and utter folly of it  thank you thats really kind   cheers  congratulations  so linda i never would have taken you as the type to get married  show us the ring  yeah dont blink you might miss the diamond   here you go  no its beautiful  its lovely ruth did you see  yes very nice  ill go put on some coffee  is there any more of that vodka left  ruthie whats wrong  your son is going to marry this is a beautiful thing  its been a long day thats all im fine  just look at this mess  dont worry im going to help you clean up  thank you  god there is so much emotion to navigate where family is concerned  vicodin anyone  no thanks im fine  okay whats the deal with me going to topanga canyon  mom totally freaked  no one ever told you oh my  it seems im a terrible influence  david and i went to stay with aunt sarah one weekend  and i kind of lost my virginity  how old were you   fifteen  how old was she   im not sure 20something  she was 32  oh my god thats totally fucked up  your mother has never forgiven me and she never will no matter what she says  granted there was an awful moment when david was lost  but he was found completely unharmed in the canyon the next morning  damn i miss out on all the best stuff in this family  well that was a disaster your mother hates me more than ever now   she does not hate you  come on nate  who cares if she does  im just glad its over  on to the next we have a whole lifetime  of tense and uncomfortable family gatherings to look forward to   hello  hey where have you been  we had kind of a family dinner  my brothers getting married   are you drunk  yes  my mothers boyfriend kept pouring vodka  im gonna have such a fucking headache tomorrow  your moms boyfriend was there  so how come you didnt invite me  because i knew it would be excruciating  and i wanted to spare you  i wish you were here or me there  why  so we could have hot sex and then fall asleep together  you could always come over here  im too drunk i shouldnt drive  or i could come over there  im too drunk i shouldnt drive  take some aspirin before you go to bed and vitamin c drink lots of water  ill talk to you tomorrow  okay bye  hey mom  here let me help you  you ready  you should have used your grandmothers ring  god knows your brother isnt going to use it  and who knows if claire will ever settle down  that ring was for you   i didnt even know about it  you are the firstborn  and probably the only opportunity for grandchildren that i will ever live to see  mom you never even told me about it  what i think this is really about is you dont like brenda  thats not true  i just dont want you to get hurt  is she pregnant  no shes not  but she is the woman i love mom  you may not think shes the best person for me but i do and i need you to accept that  were glad you came back to fisher  sons  you gave me the best price thats the only reason im here  that other place wanted me to sign some waiver before i could see the body  do you want me to do that as well  mrs collins i dont think you want to go through that  your husbands body experienced severe trauma  its beyond restoration  restoration no i dont want him restored  whats the point  perhaps we should choose a casket  you think its a day like any other  what you dont realize is that anything can happen  and then it does  it happens  and theres so much left unsaid  and it was all just wasted time  i just want somebody to help me understand  just to help  can you help me  the first line of c s lewis a grief observed is  no one ever told me grief felt so like fear  ill get you a copy i think it will help  its going to be okay  no its not  whats wrong  doesnt it ever get you down  sure all the time  you know i keep thinking its going to get easier but it just doesnt  no it doesnt  it just gets more familiar  hello anybody home  hello  dont you two look sharp just as sharp as a couple of little tacks  miss huntley what can we do for you  well for one thing you can call me mitzi  stop being so goddamn formal  now how come yall have not thanked me for this snazzy casket wall  maybe i should

talking about the twocolumn incher in the funeral pages of the la times  its run three weeks in a row now  so that is three fines that you can avoid if you just  drop the attitude and come with me

my boyfriend  filling my daughters head with all kinds of ideas  and reminding my sons of traumatic events in their lives  jesus christ the boy was gonna lose his virginity sooner or later  and fiona is a great woman very compassionate  he was molested  he was a horny 15yearold who couldnt believe his good luck  i shouldnt be surprised you wont take any responsibility you never have  okay thats what this is about  when mother died someone had to step up  someone had to take care of nanny but you just did as you pleased  you never let anybody help you  god forbid anything should interfere with you feeling sorry for yourself  if thats what you need to believe to justify your own selfishness  what do you want me to say ruth  i want you to apologize  fine i apologize does that make it any better  no because you had more fun than i did  fun  the only man i ever loved  died when i was 21  the children i so desperately wanted were impossible  because my ovaries are dry as stone  and im a terrible artist  but i surround myself with people  who have talent that i will never realize  its all hard ruth  we just made different choices  im sorry i didnt know about the ovaries  its fine  im sorry about nathaniel  thank you  i got your flowers a couple of months later  i was in peru  let me finish mopping   hows the writing  good really good  somebody had a good day  its just this woman  who was screaming at the mangled body of her dead husband who used to beat her  can you imagine hating someone that much and staying with them for 20 years  what makes you think people stay together because it makes them happy  promise me  if things ever start to go nutso or you ever hate me  that well deal with it we wont just cover it up  dont worry ill be long gone before you can hate me  i dont think i could ever hate you  besides we know what were doing here  absolutely  so what did you do today  not much  a client  what do you think youre doing  releasing your cock from the prison of your pants   do you think thats wise  do you want me to stop  its just me  are you busy  i was just chatting with this friend of mine online  i found some things i thought you might want  what things  just some things ive collected over the years   are these all mine  yes  no way  oh my god its blue pajama man  i totally forgot about him  i kept everything you ever did  mom  wheres nate  he had left home already  what about dad  he was probably working  my god
