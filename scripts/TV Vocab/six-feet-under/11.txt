and david and 300 funeral directors  cutting loose in the city of sin  why would you do that to yourself  one we get to attend helpful seminars where we learn new tricks of the trade  two we get to commiserate with all the other sad fucks  who are being edged out by kroehner  three we have the perfect opportunity to get in matt gilardis face tell him  we know kroehner burned down the house across the street  the ongoing pissing contest  thatll be good for you and david youll have fun  i dont know how much fun hes gonna have hes giving this  big speech about the future of the independent funeral home  david doesnt strike me as the type of guy who gives speeches  my dad was scheduled to do it dave volunteered to fill in  its kind of a big deal for him hes pretty nervous about it   call me from vegas  i will  unless im flailing about in a pool having sex with some showgirl  ill miss you  oh fuck you  i know this is an exceptionally difficult time for you  but can you tell us what you had in mind for your sons  im sorry  were only here because the hospital suggested we call you guys  were not even sure what were doing here  he is a perfectly healthy baby  can i ask what was the cause of  sids  yes well if you need to take some time before we start making arrangements  thats completely understandable  the arrangements  what arrangements  for his funeral  funeral   he was only 3 weeks old  it might help  if you think of it less as a funeral and more as a way of saying goodbye to him  i dont want to say goodbye he just barely got here  of course its difficult for anyone to come to terms with something  as unexpected as this but  its not just difficult  its not even remotely possible  some babies are just too good for this world  well fix things so you can spend as much time with him as you need   how old is he  barely 3 weeks  sids  yeah   oh jesus  you shouldve been here for the intake  the parents are practically children themselves  they didnt even know they were supposed to have a funeral   welcome back rico  thanks nate   youre sure youre up to this  yeah yeah its no problem  well only be gone till sunday  if you need anything i can hop on a plane and be

some of the customers  there have not   afraid so  ruth you are not so good at arranging   i am too  no youre not  from now on robbie will handle arrangement  and you will work the register and help with the books  i dont want to help with the books  i helped my husband with the books for 30 years  i want to do flower arrangements tell me whats wrong with my arrangements  not all arrangements are for funerals cupcake  you think my arrangements look funereal  its like robbie said there have been a few complaints from some customers  no we done talking now  robbie will do the arrangement you will work on the register  you gonna nail gilardi for the arson job in your speech   no  why not  lets think possible libel charges maybe   mind if i say something to him  yes dont  pussy  nate do we have any evidence against him no  apparently the police dont either  look i dont want you picking a fight with gilardi  why not you basically threatened to kill him that one time   im coming with you  great   its okay  yeah   i need to get out of here  all right   oh my god is that a penis  rico   im sorry it is isnt it  your wife doesnt want me to say   the babys okay right  babys fine  but you have mild to moderate preeclampsia   what is preeclampsia  a  10 word for prenatal hypertension  your blood pressure is a little higher than wed like  could cause some problems if it gets out of hand  but were not gonna let that happen  what kind of problems  lets not even go there this babys fine  worse comes to worst we go in a little early we do a csection  well take a look at your labs check your blood pressure in a day or two  and see how were doing then until then i want you on strict bed rest  i really wouldnt worry about this the baby is fine  if you came looking to collect more money for anthonys funeral  im all tapped out at the moment  this one  shoots up too much speed and heroin  now im stuck paying for this fancyass hotel room  to the tune of 400 bucks a pop while they keep him under observation  im going out for coffee and smokes  speed and heroin  yeah well i thought id try something different   different like with a needle in your arm  hey what is this  twenty fucking questions ive been through this already all right  with the doctors with the police with my mom   now i gotta put your mind at ease too  im sorry  i wouldve been fine if you had just minded your own fucking business  well excuse me for giving a shit  this wasnt an accident was it  i wish you would just fucking leave already  fine here  the emerging role of funeral directors in mass aviation disasters  that sounds like fun  do you realize how many of these seminars are sponsored by kroehner  whos jasmine brecker  shes either a federal judge or a sex surrogate i havent decided yet   you got any matches  sure  thank you  okay boys lets mingle  when in rome  i think maybe my expectations of this trip were a little high  oh great happy hour  well well the fisher brothers  you know i wondered if youd even bother to show  i understand youll be speaking tomorrow in place of your father  what was your topic again  the future of independent funeral homes  well im certainly looking forward to that  id invite you boys to the kroehner party at the luxor but  its only for affiliates  damn because wed really like to be there  im sure you corporate lackeys really know how to party  have fun with the other dinosaurs boys  oh matt i have something for you  this is a pack of matches  this is for a can of lighter fluid  next time you need to unload some cumbersome real estate youll be all set   nate that was not smart  i shouldve set his fucking hair on fire  bottoms up  i love las vegas it has to be the most artificial place on earth   you think so more than disneyland  oh come

gonna be working on freeform summer arrangements  and if we have any time at the end of class im not promising  because i want us to get to our breathing exercises  but if we have time we might try a spiky arrangement or two  but first were gonna start by doing a little work treating our stems  and were gonna start by working with our woody stems  because they can be a little on the tricky side and require the most tlc  tough loving care  okay lets start with an azalea one of my favorites  starting an inch or two from the bottom of the stem  and if its a thick stem we really have to smash them  we split the stem vertically  does anyone know why we do this  anyone yes   so it will draw more water  very good  did everyone hear that so it will draw more water  okay does everyone have their hammers lets begin  youre supposed to be in bed  i needed to get some turkey franks and milk for julio  why didnt you call me i couldve stopped home on my way from work   he has a snack at 330  why didnt you call your sister  she just got two days on a new nicolas cage movie  she plays this hooker who witnesses a murder then gets raped and killed  shes got lines and everything she wants me to come visit her on the set  well youre supposed to be in bed  i got bored and went to the market whats the big deal   what are you doing home anyway  i came home for lunch   i was worried  rico please im fine  im not just worried about you  okay this is about the baby at work  i just i cant do it  of course you can  he looks like  like hes sleeping  like a baby whos fallen asleep  he was 3 weeks old there was nothing wrong with him  and then just like that  he dies  for no reason  how can that be  how can the beginning and end be so damn close together  and now ive got this real bad feeling  i havent done a baby since julio was born  david always does them   so make david do this one  davids in vegas until tomorrow  the viewing is this afternoon  some babies just arent meant for this world rico  but this one is  turn to page seven in your notebooks  well go step by step through the most challenging  cranial facial reconstruction i ever faced  if we could go to the next slide please   oh my god  oh jesus   that shit is fucked up  nate this is chloe yorkin  the job federico left us to do for kroehner  oh god that is like fucking science fiction  the first question my team and i asked ourselves was not  as it might have been at a facility with less resources  can we do this  they dont even credit rico by name  oh man hes gonna be furious  oh god  well that is a very generous offer roger  but unfortunately i am in a relationship at the moment if i was  deal me in  jesus billy  hold on hey so wheres your boyfriend  what are you doing here  i love vegas you know i love vegas  and sometimes when my sister isnt there when i need her i hop in my car  start driving wind up here  billy youre lying  im really not i just saw you at the blackjack table   it was a total coincidence  youre a fucking liar  youre a selfish manipulative narcissistic liar   what did mom and dad tell you  they told me that you made a bomb  thats fucking hilarious so now im like what a terrorist  billy mc veigh  theyre fucking liars brenda  they hate each other and theyre miserable and theyre jealous of us  and they want us to hate each other too so they lie to us  no they lied to me you lied to me you let me believe you tried to kill yourself  do you know how fucked that is  you know what i was so fucking drugged up  i dont even really remember what happened  dad showed me what you wrote  i was kidding okay  it wasnt serious  do you have any idea what i gave up for you  because i thought that if you tried to kill yourself again and succeeded  i could tell myself that i did everything i could to save you  and you did   youve saved me every day since then  well fuck you   brenda dont fucking walk away  im having a life just back off  hey you heard her now fuck off  nice  are you okay  he followed us here  i hate to say it but im not entirely surprised  very nice  luscious  this is a little  tight   tight  youre not breathing right   im not  youre breathing from here  when you should be breathing from here   but my lungs are here  of course they are  im speaking metaphorically  if you breathe from up here your arrangements will come from up here  if you breathe from down here your arrangements will come from down here   and thats good  thats very good   do you do yoga  no  okay would everybody grab a yoga mat in the next room  were gonna do some breathing exercises before we break for dinner  youre a bit of a control freak arent you  no im not i dont think i am   am i  yes  and control freaks do not make good arrangers  believe me i know i used to be a control freak too  but you know what you can get over it  all you have to do is learn to breathe   are you on antidepressants  no  well lord knows id be lost without my saint johns wort  there are countless challenges facing independent funeral homes today  changing social attitudes toward death and dying  economic hardship in communities both large and small  oh what the hell  we all know what the real challenge is  how are you doing today mr gilardi   fine thank you  glad to hear it  we all know of a certain organization  that controls the flow of preproom supplies  caskets cemetery property and flowers to everyone in this room  and believe me that organization will stoop to almost any means  to make sure that the independent funeral home has no future  but hear me out  my father was in this business for over 35 years  he  he thought it was okay to tell people about a cheaper casket  he didnt always try to talk people out of cremation  there were even times where i actually heard him say  to hell with our profit margin on this  these words are heresy to a certain organization  because profit is all it cares about  no matter how many prmotivated seminars it sponsors  that organization wants us independents to believe  that we cannot afford to be like my father anymore  well im sorry but thats bullshit  dont get me wrong my father worried about the bottom line too  but he worried more about other things  like comforting people  and helping them face profound loss  maybe now more than ever we should all try to be a little more like him  thank you   very motivational  good job  howd i do  are you kidding you kicked some serious ass you big freak  you didnt come home last night  well its not like it was a school night  would you like me to make you something to eat  yeah thatd be great  do you think im a control freak  yeah   where do you think david gets it from  your father was very controlling   not like you  thats not nice  you asked  youre not as bad as you used to be  may i ask where you were all night  in barstow  what in gods name were you doing there  i was visiting a friend of mine whos in the hospital  who  gabriel dimas   the young man whose brother  yeah  what was he doing in the hospital  he odd  good lord  claire  hes obviously a deeply disturbed boy  you need to steer clear of him let his family deal with this  well lets take stock for a second shall we  his little brothers dead his fathers dead  his stepfather beat him up  his whitetrash mother who smokes like a fish could give a shit  that leaves no one  was his overdose an accident   of course it was an accident  because sometimes these things arent  and if it wasnt it could happen again theres an 80 chance that someone  it wasnt a suicide attempt  i hope for his sake youre right  but if youre wrong claire  i dont want you getting too close to him   thank you  no problem  look at him   hes a star  hi really great  i just want you guys to meet
