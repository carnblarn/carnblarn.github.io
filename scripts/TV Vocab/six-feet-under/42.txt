here nowl  me here nowl   and is it me comma here comma now  no me period here period nowl   exclamation  it is strong  its about me being here right now  i want my fans all the girls out there to know that the most important thing is to be yourself  and to be here now  thats right and this is who you are in the now  but if you were someone different yesterday or even tomorrow thats still who you are  its now although it was before or maybe later  but its you in the then  uhhuh and it comes out in two weeks  oh my god creepy colin farrell just left me another creepy message   cant we do something about that legally  i guess thats it  keith did you use the bathroom in celestes dressing room  yeah but thats when she was doing the show no one was around so i thought   its not cool ok  ok im sorry  you do not use the clients can ever  got it  i think i know who sent us the   the shit  yes the shit  i believe it was arthur   arthur  arthur quit today after i confronted him  you should probably know that arthur and i once had something  i dont know why i didnt tell you  no need its none of my business  he doesnt seem like someone youd be attracted to  well it wasnt it wasnt a relationship  but we did care deeply for one another  we understood one another had similar interests  similar interests like sex  no no it wasnt like that  we had our own language we nuzzled   i dont know what you mean  the way horses nuzzle  like a head rubbing  headbutting  you butted heads  you make it sound so sordid  look we did this   stop it it was quite lovely it wasnt funny  no  yes maybe we were a little crazy  its called a folie  deux  two people confusing a momentary insanity for love  is that what its called  im sorry jaden and i have to go meet some people at the grove   no its fine i just thought  hey did you get my bed all wet  i thought you were coming back   i wish  maya and i could stay here with the nanny  i could pop in a movie for her we could be waiting when you get back  youre funny  god these sheets feel so good  ive never felt anything like them where are they from  i need you to leave  right   so its that easy  what is  i mean how are people supposed to do this exactly  am i supposed to avoid that particular mommy and me class  or youll send your nanny so you can avoid looking at me  and seeing what i thought i saw in you until i just cease to exist  and so do you  nateare you ok  im sorry i dont know why im doing this  you have to leave well go  ok ill wait for you downstairs  oh god  you got in trouble  what did you ask for her autograph or something or look her in the eye  no worse i peed in her john   what you mean like on the toilet seat  no i lifted the seat  i just used the same toilet she did which apparently is a major faux pas  well if it helps my day sucked too arthur quit  yeah im in hell and ill probably never be home in time for dinner again  so wheres your other brother  whats your problem in love with my brother now  i just asked where he was  god if no one buys this stuff i am not dragging it back upstairs  im just not feeling this hippydippy paisley crap any more  its like suddenly i just feel modern and simple  i just want like white plastic furniture  why not just trash all the shit you dont want or take it to the thrift store  yeah or burn it  yeah  yeah  hey mom  mom why dont we just burn whats left over   we cant some of this stuff is valuable  sure you wanna save this  that was arthurs pouch  couple pennies in it  i think youre right claire lets burn it lets burn it all  i missed you  you were so far away  all the way across the courtyard  it was nice knowing where you were even when we werent talking  were we not talking  not officially i guess  so this question of normal sex  i know it is so silly  i dont know why i said it i dont even know what i meant  i think i just wanted so much to do it right this time and i thought  funny cos the more i thought about it the more normal sex just seemed like  you know bad sex  i know  i think ideally sex for me should be this  you know revealing of myself  ourselves maybe  and i think that can be a loving thing too  right  dont dont take brenda apart  and just sort of hand me the good stuff  i want all the stuff even the bad stuff  what  so  what was it that you wanted to say  well  remember when i said i could wait on you hand and foot  whats this  you look weird  hey can you hold her   dont let her get too close to the fire  ok  mom im moving back into the house  ok  you can have arthurs room  can i have the coach house then  well i dont see why not  english
