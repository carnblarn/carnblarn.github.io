                 a report by this entertainment industry analyst released today  showed a severe drop in the summer box office results at the major studios  a warner brothers spokesperson poohpoohed the projections  previn  previn are you in there  its george the building manager  i started to smell something a few days ago  but i just thought someone was cooking cabbage  see you can still smell it im not crazy  oh my god  im just surprised  why i told you i was going to write a book   no you didnt  i thought i did   what  i need to get in there  so youre just gonna sit down today and start writing  yeah i think thats how its usually done  except for hemingway he stood   what  i need to get in there now   what you think i cant write a book  no of course not  its just a book is so big  not all of them  well its just the last time we talked about you doing something new  you mentioned getting billys friends to help you open an art gallery  yeah well i got to thinking  i dont need to help others express themselves  i should do it myself  i think this is great  charlotte finally speaks  your fucked up childhood from your point of view people will want to read that  no way im not gonna write a memoir  what is it then   fiction  really  thats so ambitious i love it  i hope im going to be in it ive always wanted to be thinly veiled  you might be in it  if you ever do anything interesting  i need help  do you think the hair on mr petersons forearms is sexy  or is it too unkempt sometimes he gets all tufty  i really dont have time for this  this weekend is my last chance to take the sats i have to do well  just take a break itll keep you from burning out  every fall i rate the male teachers fuckability  ive been doing it since the sixth grade  i am like 400 times smarter than you  why arent you panicking more about this test  because i know how to play the game  i have a tutor ive taken practice tests  and my moms life coach is advising me  your moms life coach  parker do you have any idea what a parody of yourself you are  i feel bad for mr van kirk  if he hadnt stopped working out he couldve easily cracked the top 10  give me that  gittermans coming in at 22  i was feeling generous   hey claire  gary hi   see you this afternoon  yep  gary has a great ass   you think he has a great ass  yeah  like you havent noticed  my mom calls them buns shes so not of this century  i dont care how much she pays her life coach  i could fuck gary easy  so this woman in her 40s just died alone in her apartment  just out of the blue  i mean she must have had some kind of medical condition  no she choked to death  she lay there for a week before anyone found her  why didnt anybody notice sooner  maybe they thought she was on vacation  here are the arrangements for her funeral theyre selfexplanatory  you should be able to take care of it  shouldnt i talk to whoevers gonna bury her  nate its a preneed she buried herself  she bought everything she wanted ahead of time  you have her contacts for family and friends directions for the service  and the specifications about her restoration  she knew exactly what kind of service she wanted  youll need to order the sheet music for the organist  and i am telling you im not going  she certainly had a sense of humor  what song is that  its from dreamgirls you know it  and i am telling you  im not going  youre the best man ive ever known  it must be weird to fill one of these things out for yourself  i had fun doing mine  i have a test on monday i have an art history paper due next week  i know i could do a good job on both if i had more time but i dont   do i have something on my face  no  youre giving me this look  its just nice to see you so involved  are you taking the sat this weekend  i saw the books in the library   i dont know why i didnt tell you  its okay   i just signed up for it i wasnt sure  no its great  youre taking school more seriously and youre gonna take the sat   it shows youre nurturing yourself  give me a break  im so scared of having my own thoughts or going my own direction  that i need some safety or approval  this stuff is just copout distractions  you know what this sessions given me some clarity  i should just blow this test off  and look really hard inside myself for what i really want  claire youre obviously frightened by taking this test why  i dont know  its like when i think about the test  i see this nasty fluorescent light  the kind that shows all your pockmarks and tiny scars that you wish you could hide  i see  so its very safe in the darkness isnt it  okay youre getting kind of corny  all im saying is youre finally in a place where youre coming into your own  youre afraid if people see the real you itll be scary and guess what it is scary  for all of us isnt it  dont be silly david  you dont need to apologize for what you said about the plan  if you live in a neighborhood for a long time  and somebody moves in and renovates the house across the street  that could just make you feel your own house is shabby  i see   did you just insult me  of course not  youll see  when youre ready youre going to live in a palace  claire wash your hands were about to eat  dont set a place for me im not staying   who are you having dinner with  no one  im having coffee with someone i met at st stephens  david if you have a date just say it  nothing ever gets built if the materials arent labeled properly  okay i have a date  david im having a problem with the emily previn funeral  lets hear it  ive called her entire contact list and the friends she listed have moved or died  she has two distant relatives  one of which i cant reach and the other has this phobia about funerals  some people are so sick  now we know why she wasnt found for a week   i dont think she had anybody in her life  how awful  have you called her job to notify her colleagues about the service  no she worked at a temp agency so she just had jobs here and there  she must have had someone that she forgot to list  try her high school everyone has friends from high school  no they dont  maybe they have people they talk to or do things with  but theyre not really friends  theyre just filler  what its true  i want a glass of wine  oh god  its so weird  who the hell was emily previn  nate are you okay   yeah im fine  cause your eyes look really weird  yeah its just this medication im taking it makes me a little drowsy thats all  honestly  maybe emily previn was autistic  i read an article about a highfunctioning autistic person who didnt need people  she just had a job designing these big cattle slaughterhouses  at night she came home and sat in a machine  that made her feel like she was being hugged  and that was all the intimacy she needed  thats really upsetting  i dont see why this person has to be mentally ill  just because she had a life that doesnt conform to a familiar image in our heads  maybe she was living the life she wanted  a life without the hassle of other people  what kind of a life is that  well im sorry your honor  but how was i supposed to know it was your car   i dont think i could be a public defender  no why not  i just dont think i could defend people who are guilty  i guess i could be a someofthepublic defender  so what do you do  me my family owns a business actually its a funeral home  but i got out of that really quickly and now im in textiles  i like fabric  i have to be in court in the morning i have a lot of work   okay maybe well see each other around  david relax  its fine i understand i guess theres not much of a spark here  i thought there was you dont  no i do i was just worried  im sorry ben i get a little nervous at these things  if i seem calm its only because i take a betablocker  before i have to get in front of a jury or first dates  youre still nervous on the inside but you dont show it as much  do you have any extra  lets go on a real date next time like for dinner  okay that would be nice  you seem a little   are you coming out of a bad breakup  no im coming out of a bad celibacy  i was in a relationship but that ended  well whatever happened i blame him  you shouldnt hes a great guy  you get your spoiled little ass into that bed right now do you hear me  you suck  right now i mean it  im not tired  when im at my real home i dont have to go to sleep until i get tired  im going to turn off the lights now and soon youll be tired  what if i never get tired  then youll lay awake for hours and hours wondering why life is so hard  thats what the rest of us do  that sounds boring  you get used to it  do you want to talk about anything  like how you feel about staying here  or being scared because your moms been in oakland so long  no  okay but we dont know how long youre gonna be here  so why dont we both try and ease up on each other a little bit okay  you guys have bad toothpaste  my first instinct is to get angry with her i open my mouth i hear my father  stop being so hard on yourself that child is not easy  i swore to myself i would never be like him  im not in the mood  fine  get up   hello  hi melissa its brenda  chenowith  your massage therapist  hey hows it going  listen i was just wondering if you hadnt eaten yet  if you wanted to have lunch  actually im at a restaurant right now  look im probably breaking all these clientmasseuse boundaries  ill see you at your regular appointment tomorrow  no i was just gonna say im by myself id love the company  thank god  oh jesus  this ones gonna be one hell of a ride  im sure youll be able to take care of it  yeah well dont be  she mustve been laying out for a week in a partiallyventilated space  why cant everyone die in an airconditioned room  her face is discolored from being lain on  that i can fix although its gonna take me hours  her abdomens all distended this womans got a lot of gas in there  when i poke a hole were gonna get some major fumes  whew nellie  i have no idea why i came in here   maybe you have alzheimers  yeah maybe  we really are just biology arent we  you may need to talk the family out of an open casket   theres only so much i can do man  she doesnt have any family   no one  no friends or anybody  i ran an obituary in the paper today  im just praying someone will read it and come tomorrow  preneed  if she wanted an open casket well try to give her one  ill boost up the fluids and see if thatll bring the swelling down  theres a good chance were going to get some skin slippage and then were screwed  maybe she was just some vicious asshole you know  just twisted and evil maybe thats why she didnt have any people in her life  no  you can tell what kind of life people lived even when theyre dead  yeah she was all right  please have your ids out and ready so we can speed things along   claire fisher  id   sign right here  name   parker mckenna  lets see  parker sign here please  next  does anybody have an extra number two pencil  here you go  so it sounds like a pretty serious relationship for you  it is  i love nate i really do  but lately i feel kind of separate from him  which i know is healthy on one level  but on another i kind of miss how it was  when we started seeing each other and werent together  id be wondering what is he doing all day long  now  i never even think about it  i dont know exactly when i changed  but at some point he became less present with me  sometimes i think its because i dont give him enough to be present for  but then i think maybe hes not present because he knows if he was really present  then id leave him  you know its just so sad that you can love somebody so much  and have absolutely no idea whats going on in their head   relationships are fucked  thats what i always say  i havent had a real relationship in over a decade   is that because you  because i blow guys for money  im so sorry that was  its okay  ive only been doing that for about five years  so why then  im just not built for it some people arent i think  its not healthy or unhealthy it just is  oh shit  im being paged by a client  i am not driving out to calabasas in this traffic  let the jerk whack off  you know im really glad you could have lunch  me too  you know it means a lot to me that youre so normal around me  most people have preconceived notions about what i do  yeah well people can be such judgmental assholes  you dont have to tell me that  you want to know whats worse  most girls want to be my friend so that they can pump me  for all the gory details about being a lady of the evening  its just question after question like im some kind of freak   all right you get three questions  oh goody  theres that one  no i think that one makes you look fat  very funny  which one do you think will look better on miss previn  the pink one  didnt she specify which gown she wanted or did dad slip up  no dad didnt slip up she wanted to be buried in her own clothes   the outfit she came in with was shot  give her the blue to get rid of it  its coming apart in the back  david   mom did you want something  i was dusting your casket wall  if this woman wanted to be buried in her own clothes  then one of you boys should go to her home and pick something out  isnt that a bit much  i remember dad doing it once or twice you get the building manager to let you in  fine ill pick out something dressy  considering the shape her bodys in  i should pick whatever covers her up the most  ill come with you   you dont have to do that  i know that  arent the guys scary it must get dangerous  to tell you the truth it doesnt  you just have to trust your instinct its never wrong  were kind of like animals that way  when i first meet a client i take a good long look into his eyes  that stupid stuff they say about looking in peoples eyes is true   you just look into them and you know  know what  you know whether someone is right or whether theyre  you know wrong  and if theyre wrong you just get out of there immediately  no i think everyone has the answers to everything in life   its a matter of knowing how to listen  youre fantastic  fuck you are  there is no bullshit with you you are just who you are period  even the way you talk about your work  you provide a service for which youre wellcompensated   unlike the rest of us losers  please  if there was anything else that paid this much i would do it in a heartbeat  but theres not a touch of victimhood about you  its almost like its empowering in a way  i went through that whole feminist rationalization stuff at first  now im just a little more honest  its just a way to pay the bills  sorry i cant make it to the funeral  my kids got a soccer game  she was one of your tenants for gods sake  she lived among you  hey come on i just started all right  she only lived among me for a week  she never even got to finish her crossword puzzle  all right look   five minutes  yep great  mom  eddie needs to adapt to how things have changed  i have a lot more responsibility now  he needs to be more understanding that sometimes im gonna be tired man   yeah kids come first period  exactly  have you had this conversation with him  hed just say i need to make more time for him which would piss me off  so why bother talking to him about it  because you keep everything bottled up inside you my friend  thats not good that creates cancer   give me a break  it does  my wifes cousin was a very angry person but she never showed it  she just cleaned all day then she lost both her breasts  its weird  you get away from me dickless fuck   you dont own me  what the fucks wrong with you  you know you fucking lie to me bitch  bitch ill blow your fucking brains out you stupid cunt  i wish you would but you dont got the balls to shoot me   police drop the gun  stay out of this fucking cops  drop the gun  you shoot me theyll shoot you then youll be dead  you know what the world will be a better place   shut up  drop the gun now  what is wrong with you what did you do that for  whats wrong with you  i like all of these but they seem so flat  i wish one had a little more oomph   just grab that one that one has oomph  no it doesnt  dont rush me nate im not nearly done  and i havent even started with the shoes and the jewelry  nate fisher  yeah hi i left a message there for father martin farrell  he was requested by the deceased to officiate at her funeral  great well im fucked  im sorry sister  are there any other priests youd recommend for a funeral tomorrow  mom   what are you hungry  of course not   then are you ready to go  i dont know  maybe she liked solitude  maybe she was living the life she wanted and was happy  i hope so  but what if some nights she wanted to talk to someone  and she picked up the phone  and realized she didnt have anyone she could call what then  we dont know that she didnt have anyone to call maybe there was someone  i hope so  no one thinks you did anything wrong you were just doing your job okay  now i know whats different  youre not wearing your glasses tonight  i was getting dressed and nothing looked right  and i realized it was all my glasses fault  so i put in these contacts which i actually hate  but i thought it was worth it if youd  this is me without betablockers  its good  maybe its even better   i still work in the family business  excuse me  im a funeral director thats who i am  i have to say im glad youre not in textiles that sounded really dull  why did you lie  well come on  people always get that look in their eyes like theres something wrong with you  they wait about 5 seconds before bringing the conversation around to necrophilia  i just liked you too much and i was scared it would repulse you  so what made you tell me now  because on our last date i just sort of liked you  and now i really like you   so i didnt screw things up because i lied  no i think its cute   and im gonna wanna take this slow  all right  can we just make out already  we had plans to meet tonight at the tiki ti  did we  claire why did you blow me off and why didnt you return my phone calls  because i have nothing to say to you  look i know this is about the sats but it wasnt my fault  it was my mothers idea she heard about this girl through one of her friends  shes this genius from westlake whos going around taking the test  and let me tell you it works  she got three people into yale and five into harvard   this is so gross  what was i supposed to do  my mom came into my room last night and told me shed already paid the girl 1000  you make me so sick just get out of here  okay i dont feel like ever seeing you again   youre serious  yeah i am  fine fuck you claire  by the way i flirted for 45 minutes with gary deitman outside of school yesterday  and hes this total horny little freak  and im gonna bag him big time  congratulations i hope you and his stupid buns will be very happy together  david fisher and benjamin cooper invite you to a holiday open house   merry christmas from ben and david  happy holidays from the cooperfishers  fish  coop new this fall on abc  keith whats wrong  im not sure  okay come in and sit down  i shouldnt have even come here  its fine  you want a beer   i have rolling rock or amstel light  i killed someone today   oh my god  it was this guy  him and his woman were having a fight  they were obviously both high on something  he had a gun and  im sure whatever it was you did the right thing  hes dead you fucking idiot  i should have aimed at his arm or his leg  im stupid  im so fucking stupid  i never killed someone before  i cant live with this  i dont know how to help you  do you want to pray  maybe that would do something  davids not up yet  so wheres emily previn  shes in there  so shes not gonna have an open casket   i couldnt do it  okay  i was supposed to take the kids to dinner so vanessa could have the night off  but instead i was here  until 900 last night  skin was fricking pouring off that womans face  i get all this shit from vanessa and i wasnt able to restore the poor lady  nobody could have  but here you think you can do it  heres some tools  i want to watch you swim in that skin go ahead  all i said was okay  im sorry  i just wish i couldve done her the way she wanted  if itll make you feel any better i dont think there are even gonna be any mourners  thanks  hello  its me   i thought you were still here  i had to get back home  are you okay  yeah im fine  listen what happened last night that was wrong  i dont know why i went to you but obviously i wasnt thinking right  obviously  im in a relationship  i know that im not an idiot  i just thought you and i could be friends  but i was just kidding myself  look i dont think that you and i should see each other anymore  david  yeah im here sure whatever you want  i knew you would understand  goodbye  bye  thank you that was intense  youre practically like jelly you dont need this  maybe not but i love it  youre gifted you know that  hello  dont give me that bullshit i want your ass there in half an hour  okay fuck you you are officially dead to me now  everything okay  i have a client at 215 and my watcher just cancelled  your watcher  he likes to be watched by another girl while i do him  its the easiest 100 in the world  and this asshole just blew me off for a runway audition  god i hate models  fuck  if youre sitting in the corner depressed pick up  pick up  all right be depressed  listen if youre in a jam  this isnt a science project honey this is business  please you think i cant handle it  like i said its pretty easy  actually its like youre invisible just sitting and watching  i can do that  i sit and watch all the time in fact thats mostly all i do  i guess youve been in threeway situations before   i mean who hasnt  yeah  fuck  ive never seen you this angry before its terrific   no my nephew made that  sorry  here talk to me  this girl cheated on the sats and now shes gonna get away with it  okay whats this girls name  when i realized what was going on i just wanted to run and not take the test  but i did i took it like an idiot and what was the point  its all just some stupid game  i dont know what i want but i dont want this  and this is your excuse to bail  bail whats that some hip lingo you think kids say   you are so lame sometimes  direct your anger at me if you need to  by the way you can fuck parker mckenna but if i were you id wear a condom  because im sure she has hepatitis at the very least  what are you talking about  if youre referring to the conversation i had with parker thats all it was  a conversation  i have conversations with lots of young women they approach me  claire im worried about you  why  youre getting your life together and it scares you  so you want to slip into the old habit of focusing on someone elses drama  instead of concentrating on yourself you need to stop doing that  youre right  and now is probably as good a time as any to talk about the sexual tension between us   what  it exists  its a part of transference and countertransference  so we should acknowledge its out there and itll never be acted upon  because to do so would be irresponsible and destructive  do you have anything that you would like to contribute  no i dont  okay  i bet you i could glue this together if i tried hard  i know people dont really glue things together anymore  but i could probably fix this  youve reached the private line of david fisher  please leave a message after the beep  hi david its ben im calling to figure out what times good for you on saturday  and i had a really good time last night especially the making out part  okay bye  yeah honey  you know exactly how i like it  come on move your tongue around it  yeah  and i am telling you  im not going  im the best man youll ever know  theres no way i could ever go  nate i love you  now that ive heard this song five times in a row i can honestly say i dislike it  im here for the service  look around nobodys here theres not gonna be any service  i couldnt even get a minister and they get paid  ive taken care of that father jack is on his way here right now   just give me 10 minutes  for what   federico  yes mrs f  could you come upstairs please  keith  david i need you for a few minutes   mom i have a headache  too bad   but im in the middle of a show  just do what i say  and get out of those ragamuffin clothes  why is this happening  i dont know our structures probably need new fencing   and our roofs had bad shingles  i had shingles once  she was supposed to have an open casket  i did the best i could okay  i didnt see you down there helping me out  leave it alone  we gather to mourn the passing of emily previn  i did not know emily previn  from what i gather few if any people did  people might wonder what point there is in leading a life  where you dont touch any other lives  but it would be arrogant of us to assume that  every life is a contribution we just may not see how  im glad to encounter emily previn even if it is in death  everyone comes into our life for a reason  and it is our responsibility to learn what they have to teach us  now in accordance with emilys wishes  i will read from the book of matthew chapter 11  strange but somehow i feel like emily won  she remains a fucking question mark right up to the bitter end  basically all i know about her is that she kept wheat thins in her refrigerator  thats something  so tell your mother i have to get back to work  unlike some people  im sorry federico but i have a headache am i not allowed to have a headache   its so good to see you  hello father  how is everything at st stephens  its okay  apropos of what i said earlier i wanted to thank you david  im really glad you came into my life  you will never know how much you taught me about myself  really how so  another time maybe   you look a little sad  i have a headache  well god bless  david come over here theres something i want to say to the three of you  oh lord our gutters are clogged i think we need to see about removing the leaves  thats very funny claire  i know you think the plan is ridiculous   no we dont  we just think its weird  did any one of you wonder why i felt the need to change the structure of my life  did you even care  at first i didnt understand why i was so upset about emily previn  then it hit me i dont want to turn into her  life is hard enough without not having people to help you   but mom you have us  i do not  nate youve been walking around like a zombie for months  youre lying in bed during the day god knows why  i have a headache  claire i cant even look in your direction  without you acting like its some incredible imposition  all i want is for us not to be strangers i want some intimacy  give me intimacy  wont any of you have intimacy with me  okay i guess i have my answer  mom wait  i just think that intimacy should happen a little more organically than this  fine then ill simply wait for it like i have been  i just pray that it happens before i end up like emily previn  now if youll please excuse me  when i saw you typing at your computer you had the strangest expression  i was writing its called flow  you know all about flow dont you  let me ask you a question  do you think you and i have as much intimacy as you want  i dont have as much of anything as i want  thats not really much of an answer  it wasnt really much of a question  did you remember to lock the door  yes i did for the second time youve been acting strange tonight   what do you mean  well youve been all jumpy  oh god  okay something has been on my mind  nate fisher  would you be my wife  my god this isnt what i was expecting   is that a no  no of course not  it is kind of an ugly ring its got these greek letters on it  delta phi delta its my grandfathers fraternity ring  i found it when i was cleaning up  and thats when i got the idea  to propose to you  so why today  i dont know  i just started thinking  i dont know what id do if i ever lost you  well im not going anywhere  promise  of course ill marry you i love you absolutely  i love you yeah lets get married  yes lets get married  come on  i love you too
