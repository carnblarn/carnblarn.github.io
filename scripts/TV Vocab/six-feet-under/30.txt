caused by a severely leaking heart valve  we used to joke about that too bleeding heart  have any of his family been contacted  i called his sister in phoenix but shes not coming  his family was never very accepting of things  bob and i were together for 22 years so im his family  we have durable power of attorney ill have our lawyer fax it to you  im sorry we have to ask you for that  im a scenic designer for the los angeles lyric opera  bob was the lighting designer  i was told that you would be more open to accommodating certain requests  you gotta be kidding me a fucking opera  he just wants to design a set and rig some special lighting   how long is this gonna take  two days  no way we could have three funerals   apparently hes willing to pay for it  for a fucking opera  yes federico  vanessas cousin won opera tickets once and she gave them to us  it was so completely whacked  there was like this magic mirror  and this dead swan and this bleeding spear   parsifal  yeah  and they had these flower chicks who were supposed to be hot  and they were all just major wideloads  and these lameassed knights who were prancing around  and singing at the top of their lungs  it was just so fucking   gay  i was gonna say stupid  you dont wanna do this funeral you think its too gay   thats not what i was gonna say  were doing it  these guys were together for 22 years  were going to show them the respect they deserve  hey  you gotta be kidding me you never had a massage before  no  where have you been living under a rock  lighten up sister this is her first time on the table  what youre doing is just fine dear  nikolai tried to get me to come here   why didnt you  i dont know i was afraid  if youre afraid of something it probably means you should do it  i dont usually like being touched by strangers  but this is invigorating  its mandatory i started getting a massage every week  after i caught my second husband cheating on me  im not a porcelain butterfly you want a tip or not   i cheated on my husband  no way  its true with my hairdresser  he was the one who first took me hiking  way to go fisher  i cheated on number two but only after i knew he was cheating on me  thats fair  i even slept with his gastroenterologist  for some reason i thought that would really hurt him  he just laughed at me  i will always hate him for that  asshole  i still feel guilty for cheating on nathaniel  you gotta let go of that its done move on  careful with that  put it in there just make sure it doesnt lean against the wall thanks  i thought puccini was italian  he is but turandot takes place in china  its big  kevin needs something to pour himself into  to take his mind off such an incomprehensible loss  it was puccinis last opera he died before he got a chance to finish it  bob was much more of a formalist than i am  but i think he would have liked it  i know he would have liked that  jesus you could sit breakfast on that ass  if bob were here hed be all over that boy  i guarantee you hed have him in bed before nightfall  i swear he could charm the pants off any man alive and he usually did  i was never as lucky as he was in that department  but at least he liked to share  eric youll have to make sure those risers are flush let me do it   thats one way to grieve  how did they ever last 22 years  its easy when you get to fuck whoever you want to the whole time   hand me that makita  here  so were you guys a couple or just hanging out  i thought we were a couple but he thought we were just hanging out   he was squirrelly wasnt he  totally  nate used to be like that  sometimes you just have to hang in there and wait  wait for what  for them to grow up  if id known he was gonna be such a jerk i would never have slept with him   ok put me to work  ruth no its your night off  i much prefer to be busy  you should have told me this was a big deal i could have changed my plans   i wont hear of it  youre not going to be here  ive

it worked for queen victoria   come again  its called a prince albert  she liked him to wear tight pants  the ring was attached by a strap to his thigh thus enabling a smooth trouser line  how do you know all this stuff  i read a lot  yeah right  you know what ive been noticing a lot lately  a lot of guys coming in with their balls shaved  whats that all about  actually it makes them more sensitive  for oral stimulation  besides no one likes getting pubic hair stuck in their teeth  do you want to ask me if i shave my balls  no not really  im happy to tell you and i do shave have to lot of hair down there  keith doesnt have to  anything else you wanna know now is the time  no im good  in 1982 ronald reagans deregulation of the nations mental hospitals  left thousands of former inpatients homeless  i believed these incapacitated victims of greed deserve to voice their dissent  so i spent two nights roaming the streets of new york city in the dead of winter  asking them to wipe their asses with this flag  when this piece was unveiled a group of quote patriots unquote  ripped it from the walls of the whitney museum  took it to the streets and burned it  that i was able to motivate these rightwing assholes  into actually burning an american flag  this is what i consider to be the highlight of my career   so whatd you think  i think hes amazing  amazing  hes so unafraid and so committed to what he believes in  you should meet him come on  stop hitting on my students you overrated shit  bite my ass you nazi prick  scott id like you to meet claire fisher and russell corwin  two very promising first years   its a real honour to meet you sir  totally  do yourselves a favour and give up now unless youre willing to live as outlaws  this is a culture where art is not only a dirty word its a fucking crime  im starving im thirsty and more importantly i am your guest   why dont you two join us  seriously  an artist never questions her right to experience everything the world has to offer   never  ok  maybe we can do as much damage as we did in antwerp  hope you got better health insurance this time   ok im officially scared  dont let them see   no thats the goodgood china  yes   we never use the goodgood china  then whats it for  but we hardly ever use the good china  do you want me to put this back and use the good china   if that isnt the good china then what is it  the goodgood china  what the hell lets use the goodgood china  yippee  bettina this is my daughterinlaw lisa  ive heard a lot about you dont worry its all good  she likes

against the window   shouldnt we wait until after dinner  ill be too wasted by then  and i brought some music  i hope you werent planning on listening to this lilith fair crap all night long  ready one two three  being an artist is not about being right all the time  its resigning oneself to a life of masochism  ok just answer me this why are you an artist  because im angry  disgusting what do you have to be angry about you and your fucking grants  i dont use that to make art i give it away  it was your shit on the flag youre too fucking scared to actually go there  youre pissed because you have nothing original to say  you latch onto politics because you have nothing original  there is nothing original to say its all been said before  go to hollywood then that is so pathetic  that is so fucking american  is there anything more infuriating than the moral vanity of eurotrash  fuck you  welcome to epcot kids  i would rip your dick off and forcefeed it to you if i didnt think you would like it  fantastic rage   i fucking love you you stupid bald peasant  prove it  buy us another round  and why are you an artist  because  because i have a lot of pain  good   pain is good for an artist  bullshit  adolescent romanticism all artists must suffer  god you are fucking beautiful  your skin is like carrara marble  is this young man your lover  no  why the hell not  maybe russell doesnt think shes beautiful  i think shes very beautiful  and why are you an artist  because i dont have a fucking choice  if i cant create art i dont want to live  attaboy  why do you validate these infantile notions  because you want them to love you  i want them to trust their own vision something which you have none of arriviste   and you want them to love you  can i get you anything else  my friend will have a shot of ouzo with a big dollop of shit in it  our room opened directly out onto the pool  and the dregs of humanity from the looks of it  and thats the sunday smorgasbord brunch  they come for the breakfast burrito and the free shuttle to the outlet mall  i never really understood the concept of a breakfast burrito  so where are all the xrated ones you leave those at home  you gotta go on the internet and pay 999 a month for those  poor david always looked so funny in a bathing suit   i do not look funny in a bathing suit  actually you do   is she asleep  yeah  you on the other hand do not look funny   bettina  what im just flirting  youre barking up the wrong tree lady   who wants coffee  for gods sake stop waiting on us  sit down you deserve a break after that scrumptious meal  this is david at the geoffrey beene outlet mall  oh my god   now i get the attraction  hes a hottie  i almost forgot   happy birthday  oh dear you really shouldnt have  shut up  its

maybe well all end up naked   i wouldnt bet on that  i would  does this party seem a little weird to you  on a scale of one to ten ninety  which foot first  so what do you really think of his work   i like parts of it  not really though   its kind of on the nose  its way too on the nose  good  because every nasty thing i said to him earlier was the absolute truth  and every flattering thing was a lie  you didnt say too much that was flattering  you are a brilliant artist claire  that piece you did last week in the studio  was better than anything smith has done in the last ten years   really  absolutely  but you russell youre going to be successful beyond your wildest dreams  you honestly think so  would i lie to you  i might  but who gives a fuck the world is gonna love you  no matter what you cannot care what other people think  i dont care what other people think  phoney baloney kaka shit  everybody your age cares about what other people think  you dont even know what you think yourself  i have to pee  im serious about you  russell is good hes gonna make a lot of money  but you your talent is epic  its like the tail of a comet   you can change the world  shut up god  im so envious of you  you see the world with your own eyes  do you know what a rare and precious gift that is  no  and god created beauty and then he retired  promise me youll do great things in your life nothing less  promise me  i promise  all right lets get out of here and leave that imbecile with the tab  oh my god that feels unbelievably good  i have strong hands  right there thats the spot  you never give me a foot massage   your feet stink  they do not  they do you get that from your father  how come you never give me a foot massage  because you never ask  this is really weird  i just remembered this dream i had  it was about a month ago i guess  i was getting a foot massage  you all know i have extremely ticklish feet  you were all there not you bettina not you keith no offence  everyone else you were there lisa david and claire  im getting this foot massage  i cant remember who was giving it to me i think it may have been dad  im holding maya and shes slippery shes squirming like a pig  shes squirming like a pig and then what  i dont remember the rest of it except that  i could never find my shoes  i read somewhere that every person in your dream is actually you  im gonna check on the baby  did you know that there are more bones in the feet than in the rest of the entire body  i didnt know that  but now that you say it i totally believe it  thank you dear thats the nicest thing anyones done for me in a very long time  my pleasure its just my little way of saying thank you for letting us live here  of course youre family  nobody touches anything  i love it  oh my its very large  ive always wanted to see the great wall of china   so have i we should go  what the hell is this  the scenic designer for la lyric opera created this for the funeral of his lover   it figures  what figures  only a gay man would build a fucking opera set for his lovers funeral  i think it cheapens their whole relationship  dont be such a snob its sweet  youd better be prepared to build me something when i go  something involving steve mcqueen on a motorcycle  an entire pow barracks get over here  what come on why dont you loosen up   its unbelievable  its made out of wood   i know  what did i miss  you and me and lisa are going on vacation to china together  me too can i come   are you drunk  its ok  i have four days worth of milk in the freezer  whyd you change your shirt   i just spilled something on the other one  youre such a klutz but youre my klutz  look at the pagoda   you smell like listerine  yeah  im dying  his name was simon rodia and he spent 33 years working on them  when he felt they were finished he gave the deeds to his house to a neighbour  packed up and moved away   theyre amazing  he put everything into them  whatever hed find on his way walking to and from work  steel rods seashells pottery  glass old boots corncobs  he must have been out of his mind  he was a construction worker but he was a real artist  and all real artists are out of their mind  yeah you think so   look at olivier and scott smith  yeah  van gogh cut off an ear   its so weird  what  every single person at our school thinks theyre gonna be successful  otherwise they wouldnt even be doing this  but what is success  is it just money or fame  or is it the critics loving you  or is it you knowing that youve done good work  or what  this is a fucking masterpiece  but maybe the guy who made it just thought it was shit  and now no one even knows his name  simon rodia  god i feel like such a phoney  why youre fucking brilliant  because i cant imagine ever being this dedicated or this consumed by anything  maybe you just havent found whatever it is thats worth cutting off an ear for  i would never cut off my fucking ear   van gogh did it for love  he did it because he was totally insane  its only an ear  its not like he couldnt hear out of it there was still a hole there  its almost two  oh my god  im not even tired are you  no  party pooper  how come youre not upstairs embarrassing yourself with everybody else  i dont know  want a little time to yourself  i know this great little indian restaurant in hollywood  the ownerll give you the room upstairs all you have to do is bury his wife for free   im not quite there yet  wont be long  youre a funeral director which you never wanted to be just like your old man  you married a woman you knocked up because it was the right thing to do  just like your old man   you want one  no thanks  so are you gonna throw away that pack you already have  probably   im not you  you just keep telling yourself that  im not shut down  im not 500 fucking million miles away i havent given up  i love my family  buddy boy you think i would have stuck around if i didnt love mine  check this out  ambiguous figure between curtains by olivier castrostaal  that is so intense  its part of the permanent collection at the contemporary art centre in cincinnati  reminds me of francis bacon a little  oh my god he was only 20 when he made this  that means we have a year to produce something this good  i think its really cool that you live in a funeral home   believe me its not  are you kidding  im jealous its totally weird  and excellent and perfect for when they write your biography  im not gay you know   what  im not gay  who said anything about you being gay  you thought i was  most people think i am but im not  ok  i dont even know what it is guys hit on me all the fucking time  its probably because youre hot  you think im hot  i do  really  cos usually i get hes cute  no youre way more than cute   i am  definitely  so you didnt think i was gay  i thought you might be  well im not  i think we just established that  ok  i lit it exactly the way bob would have  i always needed his lighting to make me look good  thank you all for joining me today in celebrating bobs life  were all so lucky to have experienced the joy of knowing him  and im not just referring to the joy of knowing him biblically  although a lot of you here have experienced that as well  i know because i was there  i never thought that id be in a relationship at all  i thought i didnt have what it takes  that no one could possibly love me enough to stick around  but bob did  he stuck around  and so did i  and for 22 years we shared our hearts  our bodies our souls  it wasnt always easy  it wasnt always fun  but it was always worth it  i dont know what i did in a previous life  but to quote julie andrews as maria von trapp  it must have been something good  because ive been rewarded a thousandfold in this life  how was the funeral  it was pretty great actually  as far as funerals go  i could hear the singing from here  that guy had an amazing voice  do you think your mother had fun last night  are you kidding me i havent seen her that happy in maybe ever  that was a really great thing you did  im really proud of you   and im really proud of us  for what  for making this work for being present for showing up each day  for being committed to being a family   is it that hard for you  of course not   i thought this was what you wanted  it is   are you sure  of course  totally
