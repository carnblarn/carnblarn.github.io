                pike place market was born in 1907  from citizen outrage at the high cost of produce  when seattle city councilman thomas revelle  proposed a public street market  on opening day august 7 1907  eight farmers brought their wagons to the corner of 1st and pike  and were overwhelmed by an estimated 10000 eager shoppers  by 1100 am they were completely sold out  that concludes the

bus tours  he has   he had a thing about flying  he never flew   im sure given the circumstances  no it isnt what he would have wanted  isnt there some other way  we can make arrangements to have him shipped via rail or freight  like fedex   you can do that  its done all the time  they brought abraham lincoln home to illinois by train  all the way from washington packed in ice  it shouldnt be a problem  keith ill be back up here just as soon as your fathers back on his feet  what if grandpa dies  my friend neishas brother had an operation and he died  i told you taylor its just a hernia its

you to wait upstairs   my tummy hurts  lets go  is that man dead  that man was totally dead  yes that man was totally dead   did you kill him  no   did that other man in there kill him  no  he died of natural causes  my friend renee said sooner or later well all be dead  thats true  so someday ill be dead laying on a table like that  not for a very very long time  my mom says my dads good as dead as far as shes concerned  thats just her way of expressing anger at him for not being around  sometimes my mom says she wishes she was dead  thats just something that people say when theyre upset about something  did that dead man in there have any kids  yeah he had a wife and three children and five grandchildren   i dont ever want to die  me neither  its called arteriovenous malformation avm for short  lots of people have it their whole lives and never even know  and the pills  theyre an antiseizure medication  so what happened to you that was a seizure  sort of   sort of  it was a mild seizure   does david know about this  yes he does  i dont want mom to know cause shell just freak out all right  its no big deal i promise  people dont just spaz out  and hork all over their shoes for no good reason  two words tofu meatloaf  besides now i have these pills itll be totally under control   you swear  i swear  i just have to take them for the rest of my life is all  i dont believe you  just do me a favor and dont tell david about this  this client of mines a prostitute   is that supposed to shock me  what  god not everything is about you  youre such a classic narcissist  just

and theyre not as uncommon as youd think  thats her  shes your age i have to talk to her   mom dont please dont  no wait  im not angry im not going to make a scene  i just need to personalize the

necessary for me to be here with you for this  because you needed a fucking audience   not everythings about you brenda  look at mommy  isnt mommy pretty  isnt mommy fabulous and freespirited and uninhibited  validate mommy kids because shes incapable of doing it herself  no wonder billy ended up in a psych ward not that you care  for your information miss high and mighty this is life  people have crises  they push each others buttons they inflict pain on one another  and once in a fucking blue moon they bring out the best in each other  but mostly they bring out the worst   youre pathetic  dont you dare judge me  you think youre the paragon of mental health  just because youve been dating the same man for the past few months  thats real compared to what your father and i have   youre just jealous  of what  the fact that i havent allowed you to totally destroy my life  like you have everybody elses  what life  youve spent 32 years being your little brothers nursemaid  fuck you  to avoid having any emotional life of your own  and now that hes been put away  youre gonna have to face your own demons  and sweetheart theyre legion  get out of my car  i would be happy to  i hope you

momma calls my uncle keith a punkass fudgepacker  cause he likes men instead of women  i guess that makes you a punkass fudgepacker too dont it  we dont use those kinds of words at this table   we dont use those kinds of words at all  how come   because those words are  hateful those are hateful words  what words do you use  homosexual  my uncle keith has a new boyfriend his names eddie  he drives an ambulance but i dont like him too much  why not  he looks at himself in the mirror a lot and he talks to me like im stupid   im sure thats not true  yes it is  it is true  some people just dont know how to talk to children  tell me about it  i think ill start the dishes  its time for you to leave now  go   is everything okay  claire i thought you were taking a nap  i was reading   wheres nate  hes outside making a phone call  who were you talking to  ants  im being overrun by them  at first i tried setting a little food aside for them next to the back door  then i tried coaxing them out with some citrus oil  now im trying to reason with them  at home my dad used to squirt them with lighter fluid and torch them  im not still in love with your brother if thats what youre thinking  actually i wasnt thinking that  i used to be  i used to think one day he would realize i was the one for him  he never has  do you think he ever will  im probably not the person to be asking that question  hes my brother but to tell you the truth im just getting to know the guy  hes a heartbreaker thats for sure  there are a dozen women all over seattle  who would freak if they knew he was back here   you must think im so stupid  no i dont   do you have a boyfriend  no  not anymore  we broke up  youre better off trust me  fucking ants  i just wanted to hear how your day went  my mother practically beat the shit out of a woman in a parking lot  but apart from that im fine   hows seattle  seattles good  your mother tried to beat the shit out of somebody  i really dont feel like reliving that right now  hows it going with claire  great were getting along great  is everything okay  i just have a headache  were gonna hit the road first thing in the morning  okay ill see you then  i just ran a bath and its getting cold so  i miss you  i miss you too  you never called  how did you know where i live  thats not really important  i think maybe it is  you wanna know whats really important  show me  did she give you a hard time  not really  let me grab her and well get out of your way  thanks again  its no problem whatsoever  shes a great kid keith she really is

it  no i couldnt  i want you to have it   what would i want with your shirt  would you just keep it  we should probably hit the road and pick up mr mossback  right  as always its been great seeing you   take care of yourself nate  you too   it was nice to meet you  nice meeting you claire   thanks  youre welcome  morning mom  its awfully quiet around here with nate and claire being gone  i suppose it is  what time did your friend come by to pick up his niece   thats awfully late for a child her age to be up  she was asleep on the sun porch   is there something youd like to say to me  no  yes there is  im all ears  your father used to say that to me all the time im all ears  sometimes you remind me of him  whats on your mind  you have to be careful with children  because their blueprints are being drafted by the adults in their lives  and this little girl  it seems to me that her foundation is probably unstable enough  without you bringing your  my what  your relationship with her uncle you have to admit  might be a little confusing to someone her age  im happy for you if this whole plan thing of yours has enabled you  to draft your own blueprint  or patch up some of the cracks in your foundation  but just between you and me youre starting to sound like a crazy person  i think its time you kept that shit to yourself  and minded your own fucking business  thank you  its a little weird driving a dead guy all the way back to la  its only weird if you make it weird   its a little weird  its not  you know nate i dont know why  but its comforting to know youre just as fucked up as the rest of us  im not anywhere near as fucked up as the rest of you   you are  im not   yes you are  shut up and drive
