couch your mother bought us  michael claims to love this one  in my opinion hes trying to do what he thinks his mother wants  which is typical really  fine deny it why change now  would you like to sit down for a minute  im fine its just michaels here  he didnt want to deal with this stuff when he was alive  you know the funeral  now hes very opinionated  im a psychic so you know  that must be

right  its all gonna be okay  thanks  okay honey if its what you want its your funeral  look she gave me her card  spiritual consultation and past life regression  for gods sake who does this  who spends 100 to be told they were once eleanor of aquitaine  or whoever the marquis de sade  so what do you think happens after we die heaven   or hell  really  but with angels devils or brimstone or whatever  i dont know what it looks like or whos there  but i do believe there are consequences for the way we live our lives  you know sometimes i kind of feel like dads around  do you ever  nope  you know we have the independent funeral directors lunch today right  why do i have to go thats your thing  its your thing too now these are your colleagues you need to know them  i know who they are i met them in vegas theyre freaks   theyre not freaks  nobody likes the brazil nuts david  not the local guys  im sure the la morticians are a lot more fun than those from montana  youre an la mortician now nate this is your community  its polite for the first person downstairs to make the coffee  even if that person has a penis  its also polite for the first person who uses the bathroom  to spend less than 45 minutes in there even if that person has a vulva   oh goodness everyones here  with all their genitalia   excuse me  mom would you like some toast  no thanks i have to be in the valley by 1030   whats in the valley  im going to a seminar   what seminar  something robbie invited me to the plan  isnt that a cult  no its one of those selfactualization things from the 70s  where they yell for 12 hours and dont let you go to the bathroom  oh no really should i bring some kind of jar   a jar  i suppose thats not much of a solution  youre on your own for dinner i wont be back until after midnight  the thought of mom being selfactualized is kind of making me nauseous  you sure its not the thought of mom pissing into a jar  so tahira why cant you forgive your father  when i was 16  he had a dream that i had given myself to a man  who was not the husband i had been promised to  for that he set me on fire  i was able to save myself  but i had to leave the country so he would not kill me  and always  i will have the scars from this  thats horrible truly horrible  how could he do this to me  but as long as you hold on to that anger toward your father  you will be on fire  you may have left the country but you are still living in the same house  and in that house there is a room that is still burning  who lives in this room   i do  your father is still living in this room  so you never invite anyone in and you go through life alone  you must open that door put out the flames  you must invite your father to come visit you   but he wont even speak to me  that is your old blueprint  that is what you want to believe  because you are too afraid to tear down the walls and rebuild  come on  stop blaming the victim  all right who here thinks im being unfair  be honest  ruth do you agree until tahira forgives her father  she will never feel safe in her home   well maybe but  speak up  we all paid to hear you  why dont you stand  her father did such a terrible thing  i dont see why she has to have him as a houseguest  if you dont agree with me why didnt you raise your hand  i was just trying to understand your point  or do you think that your opinion doesnt matter  that perhaps you are just a guest here  are you a guest in your own house ruth  i dont think so  yes she tiptoes around herself like shes afraid of waking someone up  the only person sleeping in your house is you   i do have three children  see shes not even listening  ruth you have to get out of bed  open the windows and let some light into your house  so that you can see the way things are  then and only then  can you begin renovating your life  so tahira are you ready to renovate  yes i think so  so when you call your father what will you say first  hello  sorry my beaker exploded  thats okay catch your breath  hows it going  i have hydrochloric acid in my hair but other than that im fine  really  no but im incredibly bored with myself right now  lets talk about you hows your girlfriend whats her name  jenny fine thanks  hows it going with gabriel  i have no idea i havent even talked to him in two weeks  is that her   what does she do  shes a jewelry designer  really does she have a store  no she has clients and she caters  but were not here to talk about jenny  it might help to tell me what youre going through right now  its no big fucking mystery i mean it sucks  it sucks to be pretty much in love with a guy whos too fuckedup for life   what happened  nothing really just  whatever  its not even his fault  and it fucking pisses me off his whole family thing is so fucking unfair  and i really just thought he needed i dont know   you  no  but someone maybe  some person on the planet who gives a fuck about him for once in his life  yeah i did think that would matter  it does matter no one can ever solve someone elses life  so basically your job is totally pointless  no one but a guidance counselor i mean  there they are  thats the community i thought this was an event  its an event   didnt i meet one of those guys in vegas  bobo from peaceful haven   right he spits  yes he does  stan jack bobo this is my brother nate   nice to see you nate  nice to meet you jack  good seeing you bobo  congratulations  we heard you just got your license to operate a moving funeral  yep finally went pro   well sit  no go ahead   no after you age before beauty  right  david tells us that you are very gifted  he does  we were just giving stan grief  for poaching our customers with false advertising  that sounds like something kroehner would do  fucking kroehner those cocksuckers  sorry those cunts  so this family goes off the 405 we get five bodies right  in truth my walkin only holds three  so my guy is working overtime to get everyone juiced  but sometimes you have to leave them out for an hour or two beyond regulation  it happens right but those kroehner fucks  are just waiting for a chance to send in their flacky at the dca and boom  i get hit with a giant fine and a lawsuit  i will ram a plastic screw up my anus  before i give in to those fucks no offense   do we have a waitress  yeah shell be back with the fries  those fucks  they are fucks theyre fucking evil fucks  theyre sucking up all the momandpops  businesses that people spent their lives building up  they dont care about people and lives  all right we appreciate your passion but  no all they care about is money its not just our industry its everywhere  when corporations try and squeeze out all the competitors  the further management gets from labor the more alienation in the workplace   the more meaningless all our lives become  fuck yeah   its hopeless isnt it  no i dont think it is  we have to stick together and save our energy to fight kroehner   you know stan  yes i love this guy terrific  i dont know gary twice in one day  claire this is detective reese  why dont you sit down claire  any idea where gabriel dimas is   why would i  hes a friend of yours isnt he  yeah so i know where he is every second of the day  you have noticed that he hasnt been in school for the last two weeks  yeah but i dont know where he is  i dont  did you know that he held up a convenience store with a gun   no  did you give or sell him embalming fluid  no my god   so how do you think he got it  i dont know the internet   dont they have catalogs for that stuff  maybe  be a lot easier to get it from you dont you think  no because i would never do anything like that  i dont even know where they keep that stuff  so its between ethics of evolution and biogenetics i think   biogenetics really  what  yawn kind of right  biogenetics might sound dull to you but its actually very smutty  its all about sperm competition and cryptic ovulation  oh yeah what else you taking   im only doing one class  i thought you were going back to school  i said i was gonna take a class i still have to work you know  fuck if its only one class why not pick something interesting  how about this religious studies class  crosscultural perspectives on the afterlife  yawn   its not boring its spiritual  double yawn  why dont you sign up for that and we can meet in the quad for lunch  that would be so fun  we could make out in the stacks  sneak into the pool at night and go skinnydipping on acid  sounds like you did a lot of work at college  i was only in school for two years but i learned a few things  about breaking into school property while tripping  thatll help you in life  what  come on bren   i was just in the middle of something  look its been a while  its not that long  its been threeandahalf weeks and on tuesday itll be four weeks  not that youre counting  yeah im counting i mean have you not even noticed  its normal after a certain point for sex to slow down  yeah slow down okay but stop  people can go months after a certain point  after a certain point okay like six years maybe but six months   seven  not that youre counting  youve never been with anybody long enough to know this  but there is a certain ebb and flow that happens   not for everybody  it does  there will be times when you are not attracted to me at all  its just a normal ebb  how long does a normal ebb last  i dont know but thats the kind of question that prolongs the standard ebb  did you hear about the guy at the nuthouse that walked around naked  except for a hat and gloves  and this nurse came up to him and said  what do you want you cant walk around  mom  and the guy says its okay nobody comes around here anyway   and the nurse says well what do you have on the hat and gloves for   its so late i was kind of worried  it goes until midnight  was it fun  it was horrible   so youre not going back  no im going back   why  i dont know i dont want to be rude  they dont care about that they already got your money  well theres that too   dont you get bored around here  well sometimes  do you want some tea or something  all right what did you break  nothing i was just being nice god  im sorry  i was imposing my old blueprint on you  excuse me  in the old blueprint of my old house  youre only nice to me when youve done something bad  or when you want something   that makes me feel like shit  im sorry  but it really does seem that way to me  i should go do my homework  they give you homework  i have to write a letter to my dead mother  and forgive her for all the terrible things she did to me  that sounds fun  and then i have to write a private letter to myself  outlining how i want to renovate my life  good night dear  good night  the shovels in the truck   thats good  rico you forget something there  shit  sorry man i got about two hours of sleep last night   augusto  no angie vanessas sister  she walks out on her boyfriend  and comes over to wail in our living room all night long   women  yeah im telling you man  and she shows up with this suitcase like shes got some right now that  she has fancy hollywood friends who flash their money around all the time

the escrow closes next month  that is super man  you and vanessa have been together what  five years now  married five together eight man can you believe that shit  okay so this is sort of a personal question you dont have to answer  but do you guys still you know  pretty much have sex  weve got two kids now so it slows down a bit  right  how slow  right after the baby vanessas got all the wrong hormones and stuff  so now maybe three or four times a week   thats too bad man  yeah that sucks  its not like the first two years   yeah you better enjoy it while you got it  no kidding right  this moron always goes over  i should go in and correct his selfish ass  let them finish their game we go over sometimes   so hows eddie  hes good things are good i guess  keith whats going on  i think my sisters fucking using that shit again  my moms come up from san diego to watch over her like thats gonna fix anything  according to her everything is just fine now  im the one thats overreacting  i dont think youre overreacting  thanks   eddie hates racquetball  really why  poor depth perception  cant play pool either  thats too bad  lets not beat around the bush shall we  biology has a long history of being abused as an ideological instrument  to justify social inequities and amoral behavior  for those of you who have not yet read my book  the central argument i posit  in genes out of the bottle evolution in biotechnology  is that genetic engineering is in and of itself  the most effective argument against biological determinism why  the thesis that you present so brilliantly  is that though biology manifests in behavior  as we can see in the instinct of human males to seek a variety of sexual partners  the fact that we have the technology to modify genetics  confirms the supremacy of culture over biology  excellent other thoughts  i have a question  isnt natural selection still operating though since members of the species  who have access to genetic technologies are more likely to survive and procreate  that kind of reasoning leads us into a very questionable ethical terrain   other comments  what kind of reasoning scientific  you can call it scientific but as i discussed at great length in chapter 2  your argument is a political assertion that privilege is biologically determined  i havent actually read your book  but you cant tell me that survival isnt easier for people  who are born with a private chef and health insurance  maybe you should read the book before commenting on its thesis  other comments   yes  excuse me im sorry  are we not allowed to disagree with you im just asking because im new in the class  we certainly dont interrupt our classmates go ahead  in your discussion of bisexual genital rubbing among pygmy chimps  you note the exchange of sex for meat  i was wondering how this might pertain to contemporary human behavior  any theories  so where do you think he is now  according to his wife hes still here  theres a big chunk of dead meat in a cheapo box thats still here  but do you really believe thats him the essence of who he was  the part of him that hoped and dreamed and all that other crap  you tell me youre the one who has all the answers now  i never said that  youd think getting hammered by a bus would make you a little less of a dick  sure its possible that we go on after we die  its also possible that once the light goes out it stays out  youll never know buddy boy till its your turn  see thats what you were hanging onto  excuse me   michael  is he here  hes been with me the whole time   you think hell stay with you  not like this  hes just helping me get used to it  i hope you dont mind but do you get a sense of my father at all around here  no im sorry  that doesnt mean hes not here this room is packed  i cant get to everyone  i think everything is ready   i do see a child coming into your life  no   well it might be you  i seriously doubt that  im not sure which one of you im reading  but im quite sure theres gonna be a child here very soon  im heading out now okay  this is federico diaz our embalmer and his baby augusto  this is mrs piper   im sorry for your loss  thank you   you made his body look very nice  thank you  actually his body gave me a lot to work with  hardly any decay for a cancer death   okay rico see you tomorrow  okay nice to meet you maam  here we go  eileen asked that i close with a reading from michaels favorite poet walt whitman  what do you think has become of the young and old men  and what do you think has become of the women and children  they are alive and well somewhere  the smallest sprout shows there is really no death  and if ever there was it led forward life  and does not wait at the end to arrest it  and ceasd the moment life appeard  all goes onward and outward nothing collapses  and to die is different from what any one supposed  and luckier  let us pray  o lord bless the departed soul of our brother friend and son michael  im just hanging around to help you get used to it  i am used to it dad its been six months  seven not that youre counting  god is strength in him i will trust  amen   are you done  pretty much whats up   i wanted to ask you something  okay  get this bobo sold to kroehner   bobo sold my bobo  your bobo  i cant believe this he was so committed  think hes got a plastic screw in his anus about now   i hope

you sure can  how was school  all right you have 20 minutes to do whats most important in your life now  what did you write to yourself in your private letter  where are you locked out of your own life  if you learn today that your relationship with your mother  has been blocking the door to your happiness then make that repair  right now waiting only gives you more chances to make excuses  there are phones in the hall see you in 19 minutes  where can i find a snickers bar  cant you think of more productive ways to use this time  like what taking up smoking  why not try rebuilding with someone right now  i read your private letter to yourself if you really want closeness in your life  youre gonna have to start major renovations   in fact i would gut  you read my private letter   why dont you try calling your kids  i dont even know where my kids are  the last thing they want is for me to call on a friday night  so i can put in new flooring  ive wanted to hear that my whole life

feel like even though ive been trying to be closer to you  it hasnt really been working  i wish you felt you could confide in me  and maybe you dont because you feel my opinion is worthless  because i

believed he was there you know  well she has to say that right if she claims shes a psychic  you dont think that thats possible  what about you saying that things happen that leave marks   in people in places in time  thats physics  energy affecting matter  talking to dead people is delusional  so you definitely dont believe in any kind of a life after death  i think people live on through the people they love  and the things they do with their lives  if they manage to do things with their lives  but thats it thats all there is  theres nothing more theres nothing bigger  just energy   but theres no plan  no theres definitely no plan  just survival   should i have ordered the salmon  i dont know  how can you live like that what if you found out you were gonna die tomorrow  ive been prepared to die tomorrow since i was 6 years old  really   pretty much we never got butter  why since you were six  because i read a report on the effect nuclear war would have on the world  and it was pretty clear to me at that point that this was definitely gonna happen  when you were six  and i wake up every day pretty much surprised  that everything is still here  i dont understand how you can live like that  well i thought we all did   who was that  i went to high school with him  hes clearly had a nose job  close your eyes  go on  and imagine that everyone in this room thinks youre an
