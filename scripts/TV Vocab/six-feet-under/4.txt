we fucked   you were there for an hour or so  tops  could you walk us through what the two of you did for that hour  we made love  could you please be as specific as possible  just to establish a timeline  well he went down on me for a while  hes really good at it  i dont exactly remember the specifics  he was in a state like he had a lot of aggression to work out  she said that i was aggressive   man she should talk  then he fell asleep   what happened then  we were exhausted so we left  i left to meet somebody he was just waking up i dont know what he did   can i go  i think we have everything we need   thank you for your cooperation  peace out guys  well yeah she left first i left right after that  are you aware that the property was purchased by kroehner service  yes matt gilardi said they were planning to open a cheap cremation place  and put us out of business  was that the point where you called him a greedy nazi fuck   is that correct  yes that is correct  you think i set the fire  well you have to admit  it does seem like a beneficial turn of events for your business   so what do i need a lawyer  not yet  youre free to go  actually one more thing  do you know where your sister was on the night of the fire  no why  i understand she had a runin with the law recently a missing foot  if she is developing a pattern of acting out subsequent to her fathers death  claire had nothing to do with that fire  how do you know  i knew passing the health department inspection was too good to be true  it just meant something else would go wrong  great there goes a months profit  we can live without air conditioning plenty of people do  yeah people in the third world  we cant run a business without air conditioning  if we lose any more funerals  kroehner wont have to take us over well be bankrupt   how much  central air three grand easy  guess what gilardi tipped the cops off   think im a suspect  thats ridiculous   wheres claire  school i hope  do you

funeral   you let down huh  a little  a detective mcbride just called they made a determination of the house fire   they termed it cause unknown  so they ruled out arson  no they just cant tell either way the case is closed  which doesnt rule out the possibility that claire set that fire  she didnt do that nate  well what if she did mom pretending it didnt happen is not gonna help  im sorry about last night with brenda  when you walked in on us  i know what youre talking about   where have you been  none of your business  when did this become a police state  i need an altoid  the original sin wasnt eating the apple  it wasnt questioning authority  it was not giving god the chance to give his side of the argument  it was just taking the serpents word as gospel  it was not going back to god and saying hey what gives  he said you are lying to us  it was just assuming that god lies  im sorry about the other day  arent you gonna say hey man im sorry too  for revealing my dormant psycho side and scaring the shit out of you  you really think i hate myself   good to see you david  hi  i know where you are i was there ill wait for you because i love you  but im not moving backwards for anybody  im not asking you to move backwards im just asking you to be patient  and a little calmer  do you have any idea what i put up with on my job every day  how many times the word fag has been written on my locker  how many times i wonder going into a dangerous situation if ill get back up  we were stepped on yesterday david  and i did something about it because i am tired of it  when you get tired of it you let me know   morning  hi  you think i should make a peace offering to your mother  no thatll just make things worse  i brought it up yesterday she nearly bit my head off  oh jesus its no accident you guys are undertakers  because you take every fucking feeling you have put it in a box and bury it  better that than examine every fucking moment until the joy is drained out of it   come here  no  just do it  sex does not solve everything nate  you wouldn t have to worry about us   while youre working and were out of school  right the family that plays together stays together  and itd be a groovy way to find out exactly whats wrong with this country  id be able to see all the injustices firsthand  look kids everything you say makes sense   and it would be marvelous if we could go but theres one  claire are you okay   no  well do you wanna talk about it  sure  my pimps threatening to beat me up because i cant turn enough tricks  whats worse is hes threatening to take away my smack its hell   why do you have to be such a bitch  why do you assume im in trouble  like you guys are such shining examples jesus  shes right mom do you want chris to pump gas all his life  and tracy to wait on tables in some sleazy strip joint  kroehner is going to keep strongarming our suppliers  undercutting us stealing funerals  were never gonna be able to compete in terms of size or market presence  where we can compete is quality of service integrity   well give them the human touch  it all sounds good to me  is this over  but we have to get our message out well need to market and promote  replace outmoded equipment and install computers  fine  in order to make this all work well need a significant financial investment   how much  ninetythree thousand  you want me to give you 93000 from your fathers life insurance  nobody else is going to do it  were still paying off a bank note dad took out years ago  we hate to ask mom but were desperate   of course youre not obligated  i know that  when do you need it   you sure mom  but its not a loan  im now an investor in fisher  sons  well establish a fair percentage of equity and rate of return  i can invest in either my boys or tech stocks  anythings better than the track  david id like it if youd come with me to church every once in a while  now that your fathers gone i shouldnt have to go alone  okay  well that was weird  it gets weirder there was a message on my machine from gilardi  he wants to meet with us today  hey dog getting ready to throw some blows  if you were me paco what would you say to gilardi what would you do  if i was you  shit if i was you i wouldnt own a fucking funeral home  but all right  all right say im doing my thing selling my shit  some punk ass tries to clock me from my corner  you know what i say  i say peep this motherfucker 500 you near me my corner or my shit  ill cut your fucking stomach watch your guts spill out  ill let you live until you slowly bleed to death  in front of your fucking kids  feel your heart racing  because when the other guy feels like that you won  come on david  you gotta stand up man you gotta step up  yeah you stepped up look what happened to you  thats right for 20 years i lived my life like a man  when are you gonna start   you lowered your offer  what can i say the market fluctuates  thanks but we dont see a need to align ourselves with kroehner right now  okay  ill make it simple  you accept our offer by the end of the day  or ill make it my personal mission to bury you by the end of the month  david you in on this suicide mission  david   you just threatened my family  lets not be melodramatic  what do you expect us to do run and hide   sell and be grateful pack up and move  lf youre smart  you have the kroehner organization behind you and what do we have  you  one day when your mind isnt on fisher  sons  i will find you or someone you love  im not saying anyone is going to die  there are tragedies far worse than death  things you couldnt even dream of you spineless candyass corporate fuck  just give me a reason  its your decision are we really worth the trouble mr gilardi  lunch is over get lost  are you deaf   what the fuck was that  i think im gonna throw up  hi  i hope you like fancy bath stuff i went a little crazy at the beverly center   thank you this wasnt necessary  yes it was  im afraid you might not have seen me in my best light the other night  i saw more of you than i cared to  okay  look im not a very traditional person  and i dont really know whats happening between me and nate  but every once in a while i get a glimpse  of things maybe working out for us  and im really sorry about what happened  be careful with him  hes a lot more fragile than hed like to think  arent we all   well thank you  my pleasure  are the fishers around   you need david  all of them and you too  just tell me what youre unhappy with  just get them all right  will you join us  merciful jesus  please bring rest and peace to our fallen brother  son  friend  manuel paco bolin  may he live with you forever in your lightened truth   almighty father amen  amen  we also wanna thank the fishers  who lost a father and husband  lord bring peace to them in their grief  as you have in ours  well miss you  hey let go of me you fucking fag i gots to go  jesus youre just a kid  so are you
