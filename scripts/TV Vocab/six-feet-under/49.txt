some sort of ceremony in front of family and friends  would make it more real  i dont think nows the time to go into eventplanning mode   why  all the shit youve been through lately  i just dont think its the perfect time  it never is sometimes you just have to pick a moment and do it right  like nate moving in with brenda and taking maya with him   if you ask me thats crazy  you think  well fast  lifes so short i dont know what fast is any more  here it is  225 theyre not getting this from us  yes they are just bite the bullet  right here a garlic press for 30 bucks  you want to be the guys

thought here  if youre going to be my husband  and im gonna be your wife  it will have to be it can only be  if some conditions are met  shoot  mainly that you behave like a husband  and to me that

got strong connections in guatemala  with the bureaucracy which is great  but theyre kind of religious if you know what i mean  i think so  they dont work with gay couples so  you might wanna try rainbow kids or some place like that   thanks for the tip  sure  you came back  wheres maya  shes playing with her cousins for a couple hours  miss me  no i was too busy having a totally surreal phone

 yeah this is the whole you know clientprivilege doctor thing   yeah  its very professional  how do i know this client exists anyway  how do i know this isnt some hot guy youve got on the side   i was kidding  i know   im not really worried  i know  i wouldnt have moved in if i was worried  you know this is  like the first time weve been together  what do you mean  the other times we never really

here  good were good  yeah  if you pucker up  yeah  the problem is not nuclear war  the problem is whats gonna cause nuclear war  i dont see us living through a nuclear war george  of course not not a whole lot of people will  i mean in our lifetime i dont see it happening  i married the glassishalffull girl  which time  this time of course yes what was i thinking  this decaf is so cinnamony  isnt it  i think when the next abomb is launched itll be over god   whose  exactly  the fundamentalists lslamic christian and otherwise  will all conspire to end the world the way their holy books said it would   with a big war  but all those theologies have a message of hope and brotherly love too  to counterbalance the irresistible force of selffulfilling prophecy   whereas corporatism  we know dad  you think itll all be about oil just like everything else oil  close  water  the apocalypse will be over water  who has it who wants it  and what theyre willing to do to get it  but global warming isnt it  i thought thats supposed to melt the glaciers or something  if you like salty water i guess thats good news  but what about rising sea levels or the disruption of the thermalhaline conveyor  thats the gulf stream  have you checked out the pentagon report on the guardian website  no   you have a computer here  sure downstairs in the office   were done right  i think so  you have to see this  so show me  this stuff was actually published by the pentagon and it basically says  anywhere between two and 20 years from now kablooey   kyle loves online  george too  its absurd the idea that there are kids waiting for homes  and people still have the nerve to say whos good enough and who isnt  based on are you gay or not  people are stupid what a shock  theres nothing in here but fuckin eggs  yeah im sorry i thought we needed them and we didnt   twice  whats this  oh god just throw that away trust me dont even wash it out  i think we might have some ricearoni in here or something   oh my god  what is it  its a chinese baby   whats it doing in the cupboard  someone must have left her here for us   who  i dont know someone chinese  what  couscous  its all weve got  what are you doing its past midnight  its fucking unbelievable  when you have all this information in front of you  its a wonder anyone can get up in the morning  no ones getting up in the morning at this rate come to bed  in a minute  take a look at this site  the graphic is a little simplistic it was obviously designed for the layman  but you can literally watch the worlds potable water supply  dripping away moment by moment  but thats just some peoples opinion  its not an opinion its a scientific hypothesis  but lets just say theyre halfright  which chances are they are but even if theyre only halfright  were not doing any of the things we should be doing  in order to prevent it much less reverse it  but its all so pessimistic if it happens well die  but in the meantime cant we be happy   happy  yes happiness  dont you remember happiness  ruth im crawling my way to comfortable  i cant even think about being happy  unless im doing something to help save this planet  or at least prepare myself and my loved ones for whatever it is thats next  were talking about the end of life as we know it here   but youre obsessing about these  i dont think im obsessing  well youre down here instead
