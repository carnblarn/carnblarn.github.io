 i got a map from the internet and a list of all the haciendas and i made us a reservation  its the offseason and everythings reduced  yeah what the fuck lets go to mexico  its not like i have to cross a bridge every day  i never have to cross bridges but  i think about crossing them constantly  youre talking metaphorically  no im talking about literal bridges  did anything bad ever happen to you on a bridge  no  did anything bad happen to someone you love on a bridge  they collapse all the time if you google bridge collapses you get a thousand hits  and youre worried that if you cross a bridge itll collapse   yes  thats a phobia byron  i know that  i want you to try something for me  i want you to imagine  that youre walking down the street and you come to a bridge   but i wouldnt i would go around it  you cant going around its not an option   i dont like this  its just a short bridge  just imagine  youre walking across it  and it doesnt collapse  now youre on the other side safe and sound   no im not  youre not  no halfway across i jumped off  are you taking any medication at the moment   ok i have to check in with my supervisor dr kee ok  so well be right back  i dont think hes suicidal i think hes phobic and i think he has ocd  i think you might be right  ill up his prozac and see if that helps  id like to address his behaviour   want to force him to walk across a bridge  no  yes gradually  youve got a real knack for this brenda but you cant just force someone whos phobic   to face their fears  why not  you have to be more patient someone like byron might never get over his phobia  then what is the point of continuing his therapy  maybe its the one thing that keeps him from jumping off a bridge  i think we can do better than that  hey   hey did you hear  hear what  professor pope she got in a car accident   shes dead  no no she just suffered internal injuries   shes gonna be out for at least a month  but shes going to be ok  yeah well i mean that depends on your definition of serious internal injuries  if she punctured her gall bladder shell be fine apparently we dont even need it  but if its her liver or lungs or something more vital then its not so good  what if it was her labia wouldnt that be totally tragic for her  why are you looking at me like im a retard  because i swear russell sometimes you are  and for your information labia are not internal organs  hello everybody my name is billy chenowith  ill be your sub for the rest of the semester   you know him  yeah i do  until then you guys are unfortunately mine  hey   oh god i feel

family maya  i need you i need you so much  thats the problem  youre so full of holes youre this gaping bottomless pit of need  you neurotic tedious selfabsorbed bitch  hey   move it  fuck off you stupid bitch  he turns waste into black gold  oil and gasoline  the amount of waste out there is enormous  12 billion tons of solid waste produced each year in the united states alone  it takes the nations dump trucks 323 million trips  to carry all that trash  but some say theres more than rubbish in the landfills  brian appels company believes there are riches  a renewable energy resource  we open this valve and the oil comes out from here  theyre turning waste into fuel and theyve invented an ingenious new technology  thats ok  thats ok thats ok  life is a series of accidents  one after another  ok well now we know the reason it was so cheap   its a dump  its not a dump  its rustic  it just needs a little maid service thats all   at least we can see the ocean  well theres that  i made a terrible decision and brought us to a horrible place  oh come on its rosarita  were in a foreign country fisher  horrible and terrible are underrated qualities when travelling in a foreign country   they often lead to fun and adventure  really and truly  know the saying you cant make chicken salad out of chickenshit  i dont believe ive ever heard that one  well im here to tell you you can and i have  i was in patagonia for a while unbelievable how cheaply you can live down there  then i got amoebic dysentery  my grant money finally ran out so i figured time to head back to the states  thats when i got the call from dean perelli about filling in for carolyn pope  the fact that carolyn pope is tenured blows my mind  what can i say shit definitely rolls uphill  you dont think shes any good  well shes strictly academic  muffin  hows brenda  we havent spoken in almost a year  i guess you could say were officially estranged  whats going on with you  i dont know i guess im depressed  i dont think its clinical but   i just cant seem to have a normal healthy relationship with another person  right get in line nobody has normal healthy relationships  my theory which is yet to be put into practice is to pick someone slightly less crazy than you  society propagates this vision of people hooking up and staying together forever  in reality how often does that actually happen  i think it all comes down to basic animal chemistry  if you get the chemistry wrong its bleach and that shit that makes bleach explode   right i think its ammonia  ammonia  yeah i hear you  you know i think like you start out  with whatever your fucking parents and their sickfuck gene pools stick you with  but if you see enough shrinks for long enough  when you get your cocktail right  then you can  get over yourself have a life  i wonder if theres a cocktail that can make you compatible with someone else  i sure as shit hope so  dig in guys   these are mushrooms  giant portobellos the best  the filet mignon of fungi  if you wanted a filet mignon why not just eat a filet mignon  do you know how many units of caloric energy it takes to make a single calorie of beefsteak  no but ive a feeling youre about to tell me  for every calorie of beef protein  the meat industry along with most of the agribusiness  is completely and utterly unsustainable   so we shouldnt eat meat  meat isnt the problem  its how far away from the table food is produced  if its produced locally its not just fresher its less wasteful  i used to work at a food coop in seattle we used to hunt for chanterelles  i read somewhere that mushrooms are grown in dung   everything organic is grown in dung  what do you think fertiliser is  these i believe were grown in sheep dung in ventura  evening gentlemen  david care to join us for dinner   george grilled some portobello mushrooms  they were fertilised in sheep dung  no thanks im going home to my husband  you guys have fun  i know its a period piece and a presidential biopic  but what most people dont realise is that william howard taft  aside from being the fattest president ever was also like this underdog and a rebel  he was kind of like the eminem of his day  yeah sean penn would be totally awesome but would he be willing to put on 150 pounds  yeah all right yeah listen man i gotta go ill check you later   hey bren i havent

my friend and i are paying guests of your motel and we would like the heater on in the jacuzzi  whether or not its the offseason is none of our concern  you can turn the damned thing on or give us a full refund  we cant give you a refund for the room youve checked in  then well check out  and ill call the credit card company and have them refuse payment  ill turn the heater on in the jacuzzi but only for one halfhour  thank you very much  i dont know what you did in there but this baby is cooking like a lobster pot  gimme some more of that  what do you think  just remembering the first time i realised what dad really did in this house  i had this dog yippie i found him underneath my bed and he was already dead  so i wrapped him up in a blanket and i brought him downstairs to the prep room  i thought maybe dad could fix him you know bring him back somehow  then i realised there were all these bodies down there  and they were all dead  dad was fixing them but not bringing anybody back he was making them more presentable  i always thought they were so sad and alone in the dark down there  they just needed someone to come and sit with them  yeah i thought that too  sometimes i still do  thats you  thats me  wheres dad  hes not here  is this for class  no im not sure what its for yet  maybe its just for me  i love that little coffin refrigerator  thank you  i mean i still always think about acting out  but now when i get in the car and take a drive  instead of picking up a hooker i just go to the krispy kreme  so now im addicted to krispy kreme and im 40 pounds heavier and  even my wife doesnt want to excuse my french fuck me  im sorry someone here tonight reeks of marijuana  its not aa  no but its still against the rules  i think you should leave and come back when youre straight or sober  youre right  im sorry but   i really need to be here  im  i need to be here  im really scared about whatll happen to me if i leave so please dont make me leave  thank you  hey buddy boy  yippies dead  can you fix him  im sorry kiddo but i cant  ill tell you what we can do though  we can give him a real nice sendoff  we need something of yours to put in with him   he has my blanket  something more personal  i know why dont you climb in with him that way hell never be lonely  nate im sorry but i have to take something with me  being alone for eternity sucks like you wouldnt believe  i need something really personal like a piece of me   ive decided it should be maya  no  nate you know what dad used to say we all have to go sometime   who are you supposed to be

depressing how alienated they all look  well from us maybe but iook at them theyre a community  this is who they are  her name would maybe have been linda   are you crying  no no  ok you know something youre acting like a serious freak  maybe i am a serious freak  i dont know what the hells going on with me  i love this  i feel like butch and sundance  isnt this beautiful  going on a beach
