alive  maybe you think thats cool but really  its just irritating  okay thanks for the input which is totally irrelevant but  apparently you need to feel all superior or something  i mean if you just take a look at your life  you really dont have that much to be angry about   you dont know anything about my life  yeah and im not really sure i want to  considering how you like to shit all over everything  you know what  i fully support your little desire to have a life youd see on nickelodeon  but i dont support you being a judgmental dick  maybe i should just go  maybe  okay merry christmas  whatever  im glad i could spend one last christmas with jesse  he was a crazy son of a bitch but i sure loved him  i can tell  god did he know how to live it was full throttle all the way  we met in sturgis back in 78  i was sitting at the broken spoke with the biggest badass in town  but jesse  he had some balls on him  he walked right up to me ill never forget it and he said  if i dont ask you to take a ride with me ill regret it the rest of my life  and that ride lasted 23 years  he always said his two favorite things were riding his hog and riding me  and he treated us both like queens  youre probably wishing he treated himself as carefully  honey it just wasnt in his blood  if he were a careful man he might have lived longer  but would he have enjoyed his life as much  would i have enjoyed his life as much  i had a bike in high school  had it for about a week before i wiped out  just fucked it up royally  i still have a pin in my foot   i never got back on a bike after that  i could never give it up no way  closest thing to flying without leaving the ground  sometimes i fool myself into thinking ive lived my life to the fullest  but compared to you and jesse i think ive got a lot to learn  honey if i were a few years younger id be willing to teach you  i just might let you  jesse always said you gotta live every day like you might die tomorrow   cause you know what  you just might  heres a glass of water  i couldnt find a bell  so if you need me during the night just yell very loudly  i will be fine  did you call the police yet to file a report  no i will do that later  ill put this where you can reach it   i dont like for you to do this  dont be silly  you have two broken legs and you need someone to take care of you  and im happy to do it so stop making a fuss  what  nothing  what i told you before  that you are beautiful  stop it   i had the swirl in the dip just right  just one for the road   airport traffics gonna be murder  then you should get going  all right  i want to stay up and play with what santa claus brought me  give it up taylor  i could make you guys a cupcake with my easybake oven  hes a cop he doesnt take bribes   merry christmas baby  mama  i drove all day long just so i could be here thats how much your mama loves you  i love you too mama i knew youd come  billy didnt call or email me all day  so  so you know its christmas  you didnt exactly give him a warm greeting last night  thats what im saying if hed written me told me hed be there  i wouldnt have been so freaked out by the whole thing  do you ever call or email him  yeah i emailed him in the hospital last summer  but he never wrote back  he emails claire all the time  what  yeah even while we were there she was running off to check her mail  wait when did this start   did you bring any of that reindeer cake  i asked you a question  i dont know she just told me tonight  i dont want billy having anything to do with claire you understand that  why not you said that he was okay  hes okay enough to walk down the street without a leash  but hes not okay enough to be near my sister  who we both know has this fuckedup attraction to sociopaths   dont tell me  i am telling you he is your brother  you keep him away and if you dont i swear to god i will  what are you gonna do nate   challenge him to a duel  brenda would you knock it
