                mr willimans last statement may be offensive  it may contain expletives or matter of a dark nature  when mr williman expires you may hear what is known as a death rattle  or a snort or a cough of some sort  some fellas bleed from the nose  its not common but it happens  or he may just appear to fall off to sleep  with his eyes either open or closed it can go either way  im sorry if

one woman eat broken glass  dont tell me   its bad enough things like that happen  i agree   but rico  if he did something like that to vanessa   id happily flip the switch  what about the value of

depends on what you mean by settling down  well getting married   dont you think i deserve to be happy  of course  but youve only known him for a few weeks why do you have to rush into it  because  when im with him life is full of possibilities  and i havent felt that way in so long ive forgotten what it feels like   i dont want to forget that again  its your decision  i just dont wanna see you get hurt thats all   sushi  like what  like spicy tuna or yellowtail i dont like it when it gets too baroque  like frozen spider roll of the 10000 secrets   yeah i dont need that  me neither  what

peril of the sword  no  in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loves us  for i am convinced that neither death nor life nor anything else in all creation  can separate us from the love of god  carl williman was a part of gods good creation  susceptible to sin yes but worthy of grace  may his soul and the souls of those whose lives he took  find peace in the infinitely complicated and eternal life of god  i knew her at st barts  yeah  she was pretty fucked up  seems like it   so i came out of the closet  and that was good  yeah   and im in a committed relationship  with keith  yeah thats supposed to be a good thing too right  thats what ive heard  so shouldnt my life be better  truth and relationships dont make life better they make life possible  so you think i should stay with keith  i think you should do whatever brings you deeper into the reality of your life  the reality of my life  yes but not the life you think you can have the life youve got  hi  what you doing  i am just checking things out you know keeping track  i had a really good time last night  and i think we should  i think we should do that again  i dont think thats such a good idea   how

gonna cry  fuck me fuck me fuck me fuck me  you dont get to cry  where were you last night i was looking for you   to watch maya  yeah  i was busy sorry   can i have these  sure i dont care   thats weird  what  russell used to say the whole house smelled like the colour wheel   yeah  he liked it here  well somebody should get something out of it  nate maybe you could give brenda a break shes only trying to help  things between me and brenda are a lot more complicated than you might think  yeah im sure i could never imagine  so what went wrong  well the first one was susie  and we just got married too young thats all  wasnt anybodys fault  number two  gloria yeah that one was my fault  i screwed around   i know better now  you better know better  number three  she was the one i was screwing around with  tanya we were at rutgers my first job  assistant professor  she cheated on me all the time  how do you not see that coming  andrea died  im sorry  cheryl that one was only for nine months  and doris  the last one died  im so sorry  well if you marry six people a few of them are gonna die  thats the odds  and youre ready to try again  with you of course  why you dont want to

house was built over a stream  literally over it  it had been a mill at one time  and someone had taken the wheels and grinding stones out  but it was still over the stream  and after we moved in i wanted to put a new floor in the kitchen  so  so i tore up the old floor ripped up the linoleum  pulled up the plywood  then i pulled up one of the original boards  this 200yearold pine board  and there was the stream  not two feet underneath me  id always known it was there but there it was  you knowreally  there it really was  this live sparkling water  flowing right underneath my house  thats how i feel about you  what  did i say something wrong  im sorry  you make me miss nathaniel though  im sorry  its ok  i miss a few of mine too  he was like im paying your rent i bought you all this shit  i expect you to have dinner with me whenever i want  and i was like no  glad we could be here for you  yeah me too  but you gotta treat my sister better or shes gonna leave you like i left
