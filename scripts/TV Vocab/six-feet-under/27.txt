happen does   somewhere  shit i seen this one before   tell me whats going on  i need you to answer some questions  do you believe your consciousness affects the behaviour of subatomic particles  am i alive or am i dead  do you believe that particles appear in all possible places at once  and if i am dead is this heaven or hell  do you believe the universe is splitting into billions of parallel universes   what the fuck do i care  you only get one choice think about this  just tell me am i dead  yes or no  yes  and no  some places youre dead some youre alive some places you never existed  possibly theoretically  or who knows this could just be the anaesthesia talking  go ahead  open the box  fuck it  no i never actually flatlined i just woke up  later they told me the avm ruptured in surgery  what does that mean ruptured  well just you know exploded my head actually exploded  i should have died or had brain damage  but i pulled through and seven months later nothing even shows up

weird  say in your chart mars is in scorpio well what about when people are born on mars  their mars isnt in anything but their earth its in virgo   honey no ones listening  i know im boring myself

oh ive heard of that how  its amazing  nursing was so painful for me at first  my milk production would never catch up with her demand  put the kitty down  but now theres always enough  the only drawback is my sweat smells a little like maple syrup  thank you  breasts are actually modified sweat glands  and i hardly ever sweat which is maybe why it was so painful for me at first  i wish i got more of those elliptical ones theyre better for your knees  but im sure i wouldnt be using that one either   todd thanks for having us  taking off so soon   i got to work tonight  want a hit for the

like nothing i do is good enough  i feel ashamed of who i am  like ill never be the person you want me to be  i dont want you to be anyone except you  keith now is about you listening  youll get your chance in a moment  yeah ok  i feel like im living in a minefield  sometimes your anger is so random and arbitrary  lets try to avoid making judgments about keiths behaviour right now  and really stay focused on what you feel  im afraid of pissing you off so  im constantly editing myself  i guess im confused i dont even know who i am any more  im done  now keith what did you hear  a lot of whining  perhaps you have some feelings of your own youd like to share  yeah i hate my job i feel like a fucking loser driving around in a home alert uniform  answering alarms set off by poodles  and sucking up to rich assholes who make more in a day than i make in a year  i ought to be able to blow off steam when i come home without you taking it personally  because its very rarely about you   david  i dont think thats fair  you dont want me to have any feelings  no id just like to have fun now and then like we used to   we dont have fun  rarely  rarely  on occasion  hows your sex life  its kind of great  yeah that part works  so it seems engaging passionately is comfortable in that arena  but not so in other areas  what other things do the two of you like to do together  we go to movies sometimes we go to dinner  we used to play racket ball  he was so much better than me it was a joke i wasnt challenging enough   i never said that  it made me feel inadequate  what kinds of things do you do on your own   besides work work out  yeah  my job kind of keeps me from doing much else  friends  most of my friends are cops  but i dont see em any more since i left the force   david never really had any close friends  thats not true  theres a group of independent funeral directors i get together with every month  you hate those guys  were out of time  this week should any conflicts arise  try to focus on expressing what youre feeling  instead of criticising and blaming ok  change  good russell  change  fuck its almost five ricos gonna have my head   mom  hello  how is my

it is  can you help with her today lisas got to help carol  carols having this big hollywood asslick dinner  of course  you guys she took the most amazing poop this morning  who lisa  seriously it was just so perfectly formed so healthy and compact  it was like an adult poop it made me so happy  when you live with a baby you see the world as being totally new all over again  theyre just so pure and uncorrupted its a fucking privilege  how come neither of yous been over to visit recently  because being a father has turned you into a dithering idiot  wow youre so tough and cool and above it all i wish i was you  does anybody want the end piece  oh nate can you drop mrs folger at the crematory this afternoon  no ive got the polp funeral   yeah well ive got the bennett funeral  cant rico do it  his exact words were no fucking way im not your fucking gofer any more  claire can you give us a hand  sorry i have homework  pay you 50 bucks  youd pay a delivery service more than that  all right   as long as i dont have to touch dead skin  shes all boxed up  i cant do it till around four cos i have to practise drawing a perfect circle  that takes seven hours  i have to be able to do it on command in class tomorrow its not as easy as it sounds  is that the box that needs to go to the crematory  the  yeah  well i can take it now   youre taking it  yeah  they hired me to do runs since nobody else wants to do it   really  yeah for 50 bucks a shot  but youre gonna need to help me get that into my car  so what kind of music do you guys play  its kind of like early peter gabriel meets tool  emotionally vulnerable like sunny day real estate  but politically conscious like public enemy  were still working on it  when you guys play let me know ill come  why dont you hang out while we practise  i dont think i can  ive got this thing im supposed to  ok   im phil  im claire   you want a beer  sure  you really amaze me lisa   why  your energy its boundless  you should be bottled as an alternative energy source youd save the world  well thats kind of funny because i feel tired all the time   really  yeah i think it comes with being a mom   yeah  not that im complaining  i mean mayas totally transformed my life  i cant even imagine going back to the way things were before   wow  so what if i have to work extra hard  i want to  its worth it it is so worth it  carol  dont pay any attention to me  im just nervous nervous about this meeting next week  i have to pitch to mcg in person whoa is he intimidating  can i make you some camomile tea  for christs sake im not your grandmother im your boss  stop looking at me lisa  carol im always here for you  also i swim laps in the morning  i used to be able to do that naked which was a great way to start the day  like i was artemis  i went out feeling like a warrior a huntress which is what you have to do in my business  now i cant do that any more because theres a man here   im sure nate wouldnt mind  i would  i dont appreciate the hostility he shows by parking in the driveway  im sorry i will talk to him about it  im going to swim some laps   are you ready for the pakchoi  yeah   what are you doing  adding pepper  i already added pepper  ok i feel shamed   what  when you said i already added pepper  my perception was that you were irritated with me for not knowing that  and that you were angry with me that i shouldnt have done it  why would i be angry with you  maybe you dont want me to be involved in the cooking process  maybe you just want me to prepare the ingredients  maybe you want total control over what happens in the wok  so we have a little extra pepper in the wok  its not a big deal  i know its not a big deal  ok i heard what you said  it was not my intention to shame you  i know  good i love you are the carrots ready  i grew up in a family where people express their anger on a regular basis  so thats what intimacy feels like to me  you grew up in a family where no one expressed anything  we also never hit each other  so whenever im slightly irritated it scares you  right  it just means im comfortable with you  it doesnt mean i dont love you  did you pick up the drycleaning today  yeah its in the closet  there isnt that delicious  your daddy used to love peanut butter too yes he did  so did your uncle david  not your aunt claire she absolutely hated it always did  still does  isnt it funny  they were all little babies once too  but their daddys mommy never liked spending time with them  the way i like spending time with you  she never really liked me and she never liked my children  she was convinced id gotten pregnant on purpose  to trap nathaniel into marrying me  which wasnt true at all i certainly never intended for that to happen  especially when i was so young  i was terrified when your daddy was born absolutely terrified  hey mom   goodness you startled me  she give you any trouble  heavens no shes an angel  are you ready to go home angel  i made you a chicken breast  no thanks i got to be getting home  but put it in the fridge ill eat it tomorrow  if you and lisa want a night off id be happy to watch her  you could go out to eat see a movie i could keep her here overnight  thanks but lisas working tonight and maya hasnt slept outside the family bed yet  well maybe it might be better for her to try a night sleeping on her own  mom we know how you feel about it  youre very clear on that we feel differently  shes almost nine months old shes going to have to leave the family bed sometime  maya will let us know when shes ready to leave all right good night   good night grandma  good night  are we having sex  ok  just let me take a shower first  morning  what time is it  a little before ten i think  how do you take it  black  so what do you have to do today  class   what kind of class  drawing class  were learning how to draw a perfect circle   that sounds cool  its not its stupid and tedious  and pointless  i went to art school to be expressive not to perform some pointless task like a lab rat  you want to play hooky  yes  nate i need you to do me a big favour and cover the folger funeral today   whos frank muehler  frank who  muehler hes in the date book every wednesday at two  i have no idea must be somebody rico put in there  theres a phone number im gonna call and find out  all right no  keith and i are in couples counselling   really  its not that big a deal   are you guys ok  of course were ok  were just seeking the advice of a professional to help us to establish boundaries  and write the rules of our relationship together   what happened  nothing happened  keith has anger issues he inherited from his father  and i have a lot of doormat issues i inherited from mom   can we never talk about this again  sure youre ok though   can we never talk about this again  got it  and how are you and lisa  were great  its still a little bizarre to me  all the possible ways my life could have gone  i mean its just about a year ago i got engaged  you remember that  i thought i loved brenda  maybe i thought i could make it work just out of sheer will  but you just never know  you have no fucking idea what life has in store for you  so can you cover the folger funeral for me or not  are you sure youre all right  im fine  ive got an audition for the gay mens chorus of los angeles   what  that sounds fun  im trying to create something for myself outside of my job and my relationship   i could use your support  all right dont worry  the folger things a walk in the park you just knock em dead  no pun intended   im so nervous  david youll be great  from your mouth to gods ears  all right   thanks nate  any time   hello  hi its lisa   hello  ruth did you give maya peanut butter  yes and she loved it nate  you never give babies peanut butter under the age of one  they can develop horrible allergies didnt you know that  no i didnt is she all right  yes but thats not the point you should never give her peanut butter  or honey or strawberries or egg whites   please  of course   im sorry to be so abrupt with you  no im sorry  i had no idea  peanut butter was never a problem when my children were young   are you sure shes all right  shes fine  do you need any help with her today i could come over  ruth no you spend so much time over here i feel bad   its no problem i like  seriously take some time to yourself  i hardly saw maya at all yesterday i really just wanted it to be the two of us today   ok  but thanks ill talk to you later  thank god its very frightening  i didnt know who to call  maam calm down and tell me what happened  come ill show you  its weird when you find stuff like that out later in life  i mean i had no idea that i wasnt planned  im not sure what difference it makes  i mean maya wasnt planned and we couldnt love her any more  its just  i dont know  what  i dont like knowing that my whole existence is an accident  its just too fucking random  yeah but thats the way it happened  things happen the way theyre meant to nate  see thats a kind of fatalism that i just dont buy  well whats the alternative  we make choices  but maybe your parents never would have chosen to get married if you hadnt happened  and then not only would you not exist but claire and david wouldnt either  its just not what was meant to happen  but surely were more than just things that happen  maybe we are maybe were not  i love it when she does that  when she sort of jerks  right before she falls off to sleep  wakes herself up  you freaked out the first time she ever did it  i remember that feeling of falling when i was little  like i was falling out of bed it always woke me up   like i was scared of what  you were going to fall into  yeah  it never happens to me any more  dont be so sure of that  whats going on with you   i think i dreamed this  what  this moment  just this this life we have together you and me maya  here  now
