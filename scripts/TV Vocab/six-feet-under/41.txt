husbands need to surrender as well   praise the lord  women have desires too  those wifely desires are meant by god to be satisfied by their husbands   even when we may not feel like it  like that ever happensl  so this is how through marriage we create the garden of eden again   without shame without sin  amen  oh my lord  oh my lord sweet jesus  sweet jesus  oh sweet jesus  those are good

last night before we went to bed  you see this this is called a horse  thats funny where daddy comes from its called a rock  its greywacke l found wedged in the walls of the san andreas fault near pescadero  a horse is a piece of displaced rock between the walls of a fault line  thats very helpful george thank you   hows our little girl today  good eating some eggs wearing some   is this a new table  its persian   persia does that exist any more  persias lran and this is a horse   rock found between the walls of a fault  very good claire  george has told me about his rocks whod have thought they could be so fascinating   arent they  its like going to school in your own home  you know claire maybe you could take photos of some of georges keepsakes   each has such an interesting story behind it  not all of them  i mean its been a while since you did any of your you know art  i just thought it might inspire you   do l look like l need to be inspired  actually you do  oh im sorry   dont be silly arthur  ill just grab my cottage cheese  take it up to my room   is this persian  yes it is  im not sure if it works in this kitchen but its very beautiful  thank you   i think it works in this kitchen  i love it because its yours  apparently according to witnesses  she just got out of her car and ran into traffic  do they know why  no i suppose well never know  well my heart goes out to you  its horrible not knowing exactly what happened to someone you loved  it was her time thats all  the lord works in mysterious ways  yes  he certainly does   mr sheedy would you prefer an afternoon  im sorry im sorry  i think in the interest of healthy grieving  you need to give yourself permission to at least be curious  as to why your wife would jump out of her car and run into traffic   for no apparent reason  why lts not going to bring her back  nate l believe rico could use your assistance downstairs  right  im very sorry for your loss  some of the most striking medieval tapestry art  is to be found in central france in the chteau of angers  during the 14th century a more gothic style would take root in england however  introducing intricately carved  youre claire

truth  the man lost his wife  hes facing one of the worst things that can happen to a person  and l just think that he needs to feel  he needs to really really feel the loss and the rage   everyone handles grief in a different way  he was nowhere near actual grief  maybe hes keeping it together for his son  wouldnt want him to bump up against reality prepare him for life   maybe the man has faith  in what god  yes in god and maybe his faith in god is what sustains him  hes not sustained hes totally fucking checked out  you gotta go through all the necessary stages of grief  thats how you honour what the person actually meant to you   how long were you with the lapd  almost six years  and why did you leave  i  l went off on a guy during a domestic abuse call   did you kill the guy  no

replacement for mica a silicate mineral  hence the word formica  actually thats not true  mica whether biotite or muscovite is a silicate mineral thats true  but formica is a plastic laminate  developed for kitchen furnishings in the 1920s  the one has nothing whatsoever to do with the other  i stand corrected then  theyre both such interesting explanations arent they  by the way thats my yogurt youre eating my name is clearly marked on the side of it  i hope youre planning on replacing however much of it you consume  man id fuck her  me too   id tap that ass  oh yeah no fucking doubt  check out that  you cant have that   i could if l wanted to  in your dreams you could  ive had finer than that  id definitely tap that  ass  ok l think you should go home   its still early though  i know  i just want some alone time  ok  so when do we stop doing this going back to our respective places   at the end of 90 days  90 days right  a good healthy period of rehabilitation thats all  some people go to rehab for 30 days  those people usually relapse   what about the 60day people  still pretty iffy  ok l see  so  or is it the evening of the 90th day  it would be the 91st actually  that is so not fair  come on youre not 17 you can wait  itll be worth it trust me   just wanna see that weird tattoo  youve seen it  without all that annoying clothing to distract me  just once l want to get to know someone before l sleep with them  people used to get engaged before theyd even met  and stay engaged for years while they got to know each other  people also used to think cats could suck their souls out of their bodies  they do  you know technically  l could stay over before the 90 days  wed just have to sort of keep a lid on it  i dont think l could do that  ok  im gonna go across the courtyard count to 91 and then ill masturbate  you want more pizza babe you barely ate a thing  no l had two pieces im full  usually you eat the whole pizza yourself are you feeling ok  yeah l feel fine   can l get some more tokens  yeah   keeping an eye on your brother over there  yes  here one for you one for him  how was work  same shit different day   you dont want to talk to me about

pizza night its meant to be fun   the kids are having a blast  its supposed to be fun for all of us   im having fun  youre a lying sack of shit  you had nothing to talk about for six months can l be distracted for one night  your clitoris  hot burning wet pinkness  i wasnt the first and l wont be the last  the crack of the world for all to explore except for me  been there done that  thats the end thank you   i feel violated  i dont think hes ever been laid  thats edie  ok  can we make a rule for open mike night  no more angry poems or songs  with clitoral or vaginal references in them

happened to me edie what happened to my life  shes a fucking victim whos never taken a chance in her life  and has nobody to blame but herself  i wish l was dead  actually my mom is the vice president of the midwestern direct marketing association  i can get you any targeted list you want over 65 under 21  married single gay lesbian smokers racists cancer survivors  shes plunging headlong into the abyss with all her guns firing  you just tell me what you want and l will deliverl  lt will take you 32 hours of physical agony and you will never let me forget about it  edie  you made her look so beautiful  well you and god  thats our job  me and my associates l mean not me and god  so how are you holding up  quite well thank you for asking   its ok for you to be angry  im not angry  maybe you dont realise it anger is a natural and necessary stage in the grieving process   nate  you cant just skip over it ive been there  you have to live with it and allow yourself to dwell on it you have to own it  only then can you move through it and get on with the rest of your life  i know theres a reason god chose this for dorothy  and l know that his wisdom is infinite   what if youre wrong  im not   what if there is no god no heaven  nate  what if shes gone forever like she didnt exist your child will never know his mother   that doesnt make you angry  its all right  no its not if youll excuse

bunch of bullshit right  sometimes yes sometimes no  sometimes id even surprise myself at how heartfelt id find myself in a given situation  and then sometimes youd just say the words and hope nobody
