what olivier called it its learning to see things differently  without all the same tired associations  weve made all our sad lives blah blah blah  that ones pretty cool  yeah that one is cool theyre all really cool its fucking nan goldin hello  so youre back together with keith huh  i dont know maybe  do you wanna be  what l want is  l think l could be happy going back if l could  break your eye open a little  yeah if we both could   why ls it that hard  you tell me  yeah its the hardest fuckin thing in the world  yeah it is  are you seeing anybody got a thing for anybody  are you kidding everyone is an asshole who ultimately fucks you over  i am totally done with that  im thinking about becoming a crazy hermit recluse   you wont always feel that way  yes l will  what   everybodys waiting in the dining room  kitchen  gotta go thanks for the hideout  thanks for listening to me complain about my cushy alienated life  any time  ok here we go gentlemen  thats not what lisa wanted  with all due respect nate  you only knew my daughter for a few years  i think l have a little better idea than you of what she would have really wanted  if she hadnt been so busy throwing everything in my face with her strange ideas   mom  no barb  she is getting cremated  and she is going in the family mausoleum in coeur dalene  that is final   peg at times like these  the kimmels have always done it this way  tell him ed  weve got a real nice space set aside for her  its almost like a little chapel unto itself up on the hill there  thats not what she wanted does that matter to you people at all  did she have a plan or a will or something that we could consult   of course she didnt  honey   she wanted she didnt want  what  she didnt want to be embalmed or cremated she just wanted to be put  back into the earth somewhere  no casket nothing  well that is just the sickest thing ive ever heard  mom   to be eaten by bugs and worms  yeah well you should know  that a lot of her already has been eaten by sharks and fish and shrimp   nate  stop yelling at me tell him to stop  she just wanted to return to the earth is how she put it  well ashes to ashes dust to dust right  seems pretty clear to me  i cant believe you dont want to honour your daughters wishes   it seems to me  what  i think we all need to be a little more aware of each others grief right now  and a little less aggressive  it would be nice to do something that bears some relation to what lisa would have wanted  thank you  but if thats not possible  im sorry l cant deal with this  david youre gonna have to deal with this  why not  why not what david  lets all start to try thinking in terms of a middle ground   yeah  hey its me  hey  whats going on  not much  or a fuckin lot l guess   where are you can you talk a second  sure  yeah i was just on my way to grab coffee with these  two idiots who think theyre revolutionaries  because they just went to their first flash mob  so the later l am the better  say something speak  well  you know my sisterinlaw lisa  she was missing for like a really long time  they just found her body  shes dead  holy fuckin shit claire  yeah its really fucked up isnt it  claire im so sorry  yeah  shes their girl if something happened to maya youd be a nightmare to deal with   thats not the point  its their last chance to be her parents   im her husband so the fuck what  should i perhaps leave   no look you know im with you on this  im sorry thats not fuckin obvious  thats because im trying to keep everybody happy   its working  i know its not working  i could go realphabetise those unclaimed cremains while you guys   arthur  or l can do that later also is good for me too  you just tell me do you think its ok for that fuckin hydra  which was what lisa called her ok  do you think its ok for her to burn my wife up in an oven and stick her in a drawer  when all that lisa wanted was to be outside somewhere under the stars  no but what youre suggesting is against the law we could lose our licence  look l know you want to do a good thing for lisa  they do too so do i we all want to do a good thing  im over here  what can l do for you  im looking for someone to  l wanted to make a confession   do l know you  no no i didnt want to go to my own church  oh ok well have a seat  were not going in there  we can if you like but nowadays a lot of people prefer to do it face to face  well  ok  i say everything else the same right  like the official way  you can say it however you like  well  im married and l have two kids  but the other night l went to a strip club called the seventh veil  im not really familiar with it  neither was i  but this guy made me go  and l met this girl and l let her give me a  you know she  she orally  do you know what the scriptures say about marriage  yeah yeah kinda you know  i know the basic position of the scriptures and whatever yeah   good do you know the act of contrition  yes sir yes  oh my god l am heartily sorry for having offended thee  i detest all my sins but most of all because they offend thee my god  who art all good and deserving of all my love  i firmly intend to confess my sins do penance and amend my life amen  that was fast  hello  hi its me  whats up  i just wanted to know when lisas funeral is gonna be  yeah im here  its tomorrow ten oclock  do you want me to come   honestly no  ok  its just theres a load of people here brenda lisas family from ldaho   its a mess  you dont have to explain   is that all right  sure  you do what you got to do to get through this  yeah im trying  thanks  ok bye  bye  my sister lisa didnt believe in borders  she didnt see the edges and the lines in between things  that most of us think keep life manageable  and this meant if you were her sister growing up  she would always come into your room without knocking  or she would come into the bathroom and open the shower curtain  just to tell you about some article shed read  or some boy shed met  and it meant later on that she would  call me on the phone sometimes very very late at night  just to tell me about a new recipe l needed to try  or more recently  some new completely amazing thing that maya had done  or about how well things were going with nate  it also meant that she looked for ways  every day to reach out to the people around her  to extend kindness to strangers when it wasnt expected  and to push everyone around her to see the things that unify us with nature  with each other  with life itself  lisa didnt believe in borders and thats why l know that wherever lisa is right now  shes  everywhere  shes everywhere and that means shes home   so you ready guys  yeah  i guess  this was one of aunt lisas favourite songs  one two three four  that was an amazing service nate  lisa would have loved it  so where is she gonna be buried or scattered  were gonna put her ashes in the family mausoleum in coeur dalene  oh good idaho good  see l didnt even know she was from ldaho  weve lost three friends in the last month or so  its kinda taking a toll  oh you poor thing  and were not even 40 yet you know  whats it gonna be like when were 50 or 60  theres so much death  and maya what is she gonna do shes never gonna know her mother  i dont know how you deal with it   thanks for coming  yeah  im just sorry its under such totally crappy circumstances  but its so good to see you   what have you been up to  not much  making bad art  saying stupid things  continuing implementation of my master plan  to be completely forgotten when im gone and totally forgettable while im here   you  not much  i got an abortion  when  like right after we broke up  so ok give me a minute  did youjust tell me that  we got pregnant  that you had an abortion and it was mine  ours yeah  and you didnt call me  you didnt think you should at least tell me  im telling you now  why are you telling me now when theres nothing l can do about it  because im lonely  because l need somebody to talk to about this  claire l couldve been there i couldve done something  russell believe me theres nothing to do   there would have been if id been there  like what i wasnt gonna have it  i know that   i could have comforted you  with what flowers  balloons   believe me youd already done enough  jesus   look im sorry that  just give me a second  ok just  just give me a second to get used to the idea of living with this for the rest of my life   are you fuckin kidding me  no im not  im not kidding you claire its fucking sad  its fucking sad and its fucked up  i mean did you cry  did you  i cried more than you have ever cried in your whole life  then give me one fuckin second to feel bad about this ok  just a motherfuckin second   is everything all right in here  yes george were fine thank you  ok sorry  do you need me to come with you to the crematorium  no thanks  it will be good to have some time alone  i could run by in the morning and

really sorry nate  thanks   well im gonna go straight home  ok  say hi to vanessa and the kids for me  i will  so ill see you in about an hour  yeah  you could take a handkerchief and drape it over the top and youd be in business  hey  hi   nates gone  yeah  i hope this whole thing helps him  move on  it probably will  if l lost you keith l dont know what id do  youd find somebody else  i dont want anybody else  i really dont  and neither do i  then why do we   keep fuckin it up  yeah  because were human  if there was a way to start over  if there was actually a way to start over id do it l really would  but is there even really a way to start over really   just even in general  i dont know  i mean l was talking to claire and shes trying to see in this new way you know for her art  i dont know how it happens i dont know where the new comes from  the genuinely new  god l dont  so stay with me maybe well find out together  things would really have to be different though keith   i think so too  i mean it l cant  l mean l dont want to sit through any more therapy  i dont either  butwe have to look for ways to bring the good things we feel about each other  more into the way that we get through each day  see that sounds a little like therapy to me   well its cheaper  yeah  and its true l know   quit my job thats the one thing l gotta do  you should  i mean it this time everybody in security is an asshole   then quit  im gonna  jeez  so did we just what did we just do   did we just get married  no   it seems kinda like we did  yeah well dont overthink it  come here
