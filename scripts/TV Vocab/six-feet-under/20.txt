                 following wall streets sharp rebound  and boosted by a renewed hope in a government plan  to lift the banking sector out of its doldrums  in currency trade   hey  hi  me and my buddy

your shit  im sick and tired of you taking it all out on me  this is way more than i signed on for  ive got an idea find whats yours and take it when you leave  then ill never have to look at your ass again  i have a better idea ill go right now  if you find any of my stuff you can shove it up your tight white ass  who the hell you think youre talking to i know you didnt call my ass white  my tummy hurts  the answer is no im sorry  its not like its some stranger its your sister  its not like its kabul its topanga its not even an hour from here  you heard what was done to nate  i dont think anything was done to him  in case you havent hung out with any 15yearold guys  theyre like total hornswogglers  it was a much more innocent time  what the 80s  your brother was a much more innocent boy  to say nothing of what happened to david  he hiked three miles down the canyon in pitch dark  to get away from those people  he cut his ear on a bramble the answer is no  have you thought at all about scaffolding  when your house is falling apart you build scaffolding  to support you while you are doing the work  and i think a great way to build scaffolding  is to revisit old experiences but try them a new way  so im going out there after school today  and spend the weekend and be back on sunday  i havent even told justin yet  he doesnt know his fathers dead  jewish tradition says we have to bury him tomorrow  you have had jewish funerals here before right  of course  we decided not to do this in our temple because of the way jeffrey died  jess if you want i can do this with jeffreys mother  fuck it i can do it  what do you need to know  he killed himself for no reason  while i was at goddamn gymboree with tess  tess is four  while i was with her my husband jeffrey shapiro  who worked for the third best law firm in la  and was three months away from making partner  he came home  on his lunch break and he hung himself  with his pants around his ankles in our goddamn sunroom  theres your fucking eulogy can you say that in hebrew  so youll be conducting the service rabbi  i love my new place you have to come see it  its a condo but its like a hotel too  its got a concierge and a bidet  get me one of those jumbo beers on the side as well   ill share it with her  get your own  make it two thanks  to living alone finally  to bidets  and to starting over with us sweetheart  i think i was under much more emotional pressure than i ever realized  and im actually so sorry for those awful things i said to you  thank you  arent you sorry for hitting me  yes that was insane of me but  no buts brenda just be sorry  i know it was probably my fault but i dont want to know why  so now the headline  that whore has moved in with your father  dads seeing a whore  the whore of tranquility spa brenda  has your father said anything to you about her  whats in it for her money  i know shes not in it for sex  your fathers not what he used to be after years of paxil  okay thatll be fine mom  all right then lets talk about you  you sure you want to lose the focus just yet  come on now whats up in your world  nate and i are getting married  is he smart enough for you does he have what it takes up here  like you like me  no mom hes not like us  he doesnt think so hard he wants to put a staple gun to his forehead  i get it hes uncomplicated  ive been with a man or three like that  but bern always had me because i knew he was much smarter than i am  thats why its still so hot with us all these years later  and were back  im sorry  so how did he propose  i asked him  you didnt  yeah i know its really funny  its almost as funny as the notion of you trying to build a life on your own  i dont see how he could kill himself when hes got three kids   i dont think he meant to  he hung himself  i talked to the quincy down at the morgue  and he says that the cops said there was a porno playing in the vcr   and they found a bottle of astroglide  whats astroglide  its lube lubrication for sex   thank you david  no problemo  wait a minute i know about this he was doing autoerotic asphyxiation   like the guy in that band  you got it  see you cut off the air supply  and that heightens the stimulation in the ensuing orgasm  heres the giveaway they found a lemon wedge on the floor  you keep the lemon in your mouth  and at the moment of climax  you bite down on it to wake you up so you dont die  see the lemon was lying on the floor untouched  im calling to let you know that eddie and i broke up  im so sorry are you okay  i broke it off with him  all right then  thank you for telling me im going to go now  so theres this part in my book  where the main character meets a highclass hooker  is this fiction or nonfiction  its still kind of working itself out  theres definitely someone based on you   part of her is you  excellent  as long as she doesnt get raped and murdered to pay for her sins  im so sick of that tired old story  shes way beyond conventional morality  i cant wait to read it  i jerked off a client the other day   i didnt know you did release  no i dont  he didnt ask me to  so im sure you can imagine sometimes the guy gets a hardon  normally i just ignore it  so what was this guy just exceptionally hot  no not even  so im giving the guy a massage  he flips over theres this hardon  it was kind of huge but youd never guess by looking at the guy  i could tell that he wanted me to touch it  i thought well i would be crossing a line  and then i did  i crossed a line  you are hilarious  i mean what is that am i trying to be you or something  i dont know howd you feel afterwards  i was weirdly kind of inspired i wrote this really cool chapter about it   as long as its all for your art  yeah  aunt sarah hi  baby is

god  i dont even know if i believe in god  maybe its time to find him   maybe gods a woman  maybe  there he is now  jeffrey shapiro  ill wait here by the car  come and watch him be buried  jeffrey cant repay you so its considered a great mitzvah  kindness love for its own sake  some people call that god  what im saying is yes definitely forgive your mother and father  i mean weve all heard that before but whats become clear  is that my family of origin never really lived in a house  they lived in this tent city psychologically  its no wonder that my own house never felt remotely like it was built on solid ground  shut up shut the mouth  it was built on this quicksand of emotional incest   if there is such a thing  shutting it now  shutting it and stopping it  but the plan would call that old blueprinting  if you say another word i will stab you in the heart with a fork  thats about the size of it  if there is a god in heaven he will surely shut your mouth  you never stop renovating  robbie i have to tell you something now  i do believe ive learned everything i needed to learn from the plan  and i no longer feel the urge to speak in building metaphors  or talk about myself or my feelings in this way  any longer  i dont know what kind of power trip youre on but it seems cruel to be honest  oh god keith you poor thing   you mind checking on her one more time  sure   hi  hey   how is she  shes in surgery right now  i guess her appendix was huge but they got it before it burst  and shes going to be fine im just waiting its been an hour and a half  she kept telling me her stomach was hurting  and i thought it was some kind of game  you cant be perfect all the time keith  thats what lifes about striving for perfection  and when that fails accepting ourselves for being imperfect  not in my book   god you are so selfrighteous sometimes  yeah and you are a doormat  do i really come off as being a doormat   how is she  great  it went very smoothly shes in recovery  good when can i see her  you can wait for her in her room  when she comes out of her anesthesia she might be a little weepy  dont let it concern you  thank you   oh god dont let her come over here  no its too late  beat these gourds  no spectators  oh my god is there a lock on this thing  they use this place as a meditation hut  but its been my safehouse more times than i care to remember  what fucking freaks  yeah at least two of them arent your parents  im their designated driver every year  sorry  its better than getting a call from the sheriff  saying your parents are laying in the bottom of topanga canyon  and would i like a ride in a helicopter   we shouldnt be doing this  why not  because you know like  people are having like endoftheworld sex  and just i didnt bring condoms
