to do with that  nothing i dont know  this isnt right  what isnt right  this us   but i thought you loved me  i do   but not enough  its enough for me   its not though  its not enough for you  im totally fucking fine with what we have  youre not happy but you have to make it about me  thats what i cant live with any more   so what are you saying you wanna leave  leave  i would have to leave because i moved my whole life to this shithole city  not for me you didnt  so you wanna split up  maybe yeah  i dont know maybe  just a moment   why hello  i hope im not interrupting  not at all please come in  that last song was so beautiful did you write it yourself   i did  it was just wonderful  im so pleased that you liked it  i thought i would call it semiprecious   for your aunt pearl  in part yes  i dont know how you can get such a beautiful sound from a computer  its unexpected  as a child i played the violin but when i went to college i  i had a very cruel roommate who threw the violin from our dormitory window  it was handcarved by my uncle gunther before he died of polio  i gave up playing the violin altogether and left college to go to mortuary school  it was there in the computer room that i discovered another way to make music  oh my  i wonder if youre available tomorrow night to come with me to this art opening  its a benefit show for claires school  apparently some of these alumni are quite wellknown artists  im afraid i dont know any of their names  claires very excited shes one of the few students whose work has been selected  i think its important for her that we all be there  i would be honoured to go  if you feel it would be appropriate  well of course youre a member of our little family here  thank you  that means so much to me  the secret is the new threeinone invention called the fanny lifter  part one is a sixinch segment used in the cardio sculpting  part two an eightinch section  what are you doing   whats going on with dinner  couldnt decide  why not who cares meatloaf is fine  then i have to go out for meat  so well make some rice and beans   kids had rice already for lunch  thats ok its one day  i couldnt remember what we had last night  we had burgers last night  thats where the meat went   are you taking the medication  yes  its only been two weeks he said it takes up to a month sometimes  for anything to happen at all  i gained five pounds already so somethings happening  her moms pretty much crazy she couldnt deal with arranging the funeral  i dont think melinda even told her we broke up  did melinda leave any instructions for what she wanted in terms of a service  no she did leave me a note  but it wasnt about her funeral  i tried to end the relationship before  but she always said she was going  i never thought she was really going to do it  but maybe in some way i did  because i stayed for years after i wanted to leave  i finally moved out about two weeks ago  and i thought she was ok  she seemed really  calm about it  and then its like i keep waiting to find out its all this mistake  its not your fault  this note  its so horrible  you had to live your own life   was she depressed  for years yeah   what was she like  rico  it was like those tribes or whatever  they think if you take their picture theyll lose their spirit  it was like her spirit got stolen  and all that was left was this body that she didnt even want any more   was she on medication at all  everything all of them  mostly it just made things worse  then she was on something that was really working i thought   what was it paxil  paxil made her really jittery  this was a combination of zoloft and something else  she did seem better  id have never left if i didnt think shed be all right  its ok  mommys ok  i hear that when i rewash the dishes after youve washed them  it makes you feel like i dont think youre good enough   did david hear you correctly  yes  so im sorry and ill try not to do it any more  thank you  has anything else come up since our last session   not really  david  we did have threeway sex with a stranger  i just wanna make sure frank thinks thats a healthy couple activity  how did it feel to you  fine it was a lot more enjoyable than the paintball   what do you think though  were you safe  of course  there are certainly a variety of ways that couples can enjoy their sexuality  then its totally ok to just have sex with whoever  generally its best when theres an open negotiation between partners  as to what the rules are in these situations  so that both people are comfortable  were you both comfortable with what happened   yes  we didnt exactly negotiate the rules  it just sort of happened  is it something you might wanna do again  it was very liberating  to be spontaneous and kind of wild together  instead of always being so careful about everything  it was fun to be wild  if this is something that you think you might like to do again  then i suggest you take some time to lay down some ground rules  ok  do you need to borrow some blush those peach tones youre wearing just dont pop  thats ok i dont need to pop tonight   want some of these for your bag  i quit remember   i didnt know you were still in that mode  thats the goal to stay in the mode  im just curious what makes you think that was such a problem for you   being stoned all day and night  it was never like that   how would you know  i work with addicts youre not an addict  you went through a difficult breakup and needed to act out but that was just stress  im not interested in discussing this with you  you seemed very defensive when i offered you a joint  i would appreciate it if you respected my choices  if i thought that they were your choices  and not some 12step christian dogma id feel much better about it  whenever in my whole life have i ever wanted to take on someone elses dogma   that is not a big problem of mine  but you do tend to overdramatise yourself  im sorry but ive known you for a long time  thanks for your support mom  but i am sorry if you feel ive been insensitive  thank you   you guys ready the cars doubleparked  i just have to do one final coat   how you doing  ok  im sick of being so fucking conscious all the time  its like im this incredibly boring watereddown version of myself  i know what you mean   what piece have you got in this thing tonight  its a new one might suck   thats all right sweetie its for charity  im sure it doesnt suck  that blouse might actually work if you got rid of the bra  that skirt might actually work if you got rid of that ass   its 715 wheres the babysitter  im sure she just hit traffic  oh god   you dont have to come if you dont want to  im not going for you im going for claire   i have a relationship with her  i know  i thought maybe we should talk some more  obviously  thats kayla  fuck it ill just be cold  come here baby  im pretty sure thats jan vanhoosen   look hes going straight to his own piece  narcissist   whod ever buy that  moma   lets go see if anyones looking at my piece  narcissist  i just feel bad for it back here all by itself  no one coming to see it  oh my god someone bought it already  do you think its a mistake  russell its a really beautiful piece  maybe thats why i got such a good spot  do you think somebody actually thought i was somebody  you are somebody  its pretty good dont you think for a 19yearold  yeah i guess looks like art   its dark  really i think its kind of funny  funny  its so whats the point  come on its like life goes on  i so totally dont get that and i know claire a lot better than you do   she has no sense of humour  she has a very dark vision  i think you just have this one really old idea about who she is  maybe but it happens to be accurate   its magnificent  its great  thanks   its so incredible  awesome   god you guys didnt all have to come  why not its a big deal   its so not  is that vigo mortensen   how did you get the plasteredout look  who   its infrared film  no it says duratrans  its like this process they use for ads in airports its really boring   no its not  i love that movie i wept   i remember  fiona kleinschmidt  shes got some pots in the next room  nate was deflowered by a mildly famous ceramicist  i dont think shes coming though i heard she was in japan  whered you guys get the drinks  i pumped so i could drink tonight because i wanna drink tonight   the bars over there  need anything  so what happened to you you were showing everywhere and then nothing  did you get married or something   i went crazy  what a drag whered they put you   clarendon  that place isnt too bad  i had another student who used to go there micky herschel  i think they had some of his feeling art hanging in the cafeteria   how was it  not bad   he had a breakthrough with me  who doesnt   the repressed people  right them  billy   how are you  great how are you  im good  you guys know each other   olivier visited for a term while i was here  he was my best student  after i cracked him open before it was all too pretentious right   the first class i ever taught  you said you taught in argentina  i lied theres jani i have to go pretend i like his piece of shit  jani its so good to see you  his best student  i dont know about that im pretty sure i was the only one sleeping with him   really  yeah  it was a pretty amazing experience for me  i had a lot of static around my sexuality  it was totally suffocating my work  it was a sex thing not a gay thing  wasnt that sort of a fuckedup power dynamic though  theres always a fuckedup power dynamic in sex isnt there  not always  how you doing  fine  this dip tastes like vomit  cheese is ok here  its all right thanks  i dont want that thanks   you eat it  i just had some  so throw it out  you dont want that   i dont  im told it tastes like vomit  brenda this is my wife lisa lisa brenda  nice to meet you  you too  so what can i eat here  disturbing work always takes longer to sell most people want something thats pretty   like the cleaning supply installation  he was on the cover of art forum  oliviers right you cant give a fuck about what sells   its easy for you to say  yeah but that was just a fluke  my mom probably called from florida to put a hold on it  thats sweet  if my mother buys mine ill kill myself  any asshole can take a camera to a cemetery  its better than my lame selfportraits from my first year  thats true  baby its so nice in here  angie and her boyfriend took the boys to shakys  and then to play goofy golf  baby i cant drink on these pills  i forgot   even if theyre not working yet  youre not supposed to   sorry  its ok  you know if this medication isnt working you can try a different one  i know im a nurse  im just saying sometimes it takes a while for you to find the right one  baby i know im a nurse  billys   its really different for him isnt it  yeah  i like it i think  its very  cool   and sort of painless  you havent seen it before  no  he doesnt use me that way any more  that sounds like an improvement  its my new thing  i wont take care of anyone else so ill be forced to take care of myself  theoretically   hows that going for you  im still living with my mother   who isnt  god thats right you too  temporarily  weve really evolved   excuse me sorry  come on in  were smoking some of my husbands cancer pot  its incredible and i got a ton of it  went a lot faster than anybody expected  jani was just talking about that pyramid   you been in it yet  too much of a line  its fantastic sensual   its plastic  i thought i heard your voice  i looked for you  are you ready to go out and get that drink  in a minute  youre smoking pot   you want some  its california pharmaceutical grade   no thanks  oh god bern   its lovely claire  lovely  the way it looks   did you make the frame as well  no i bought the frame   it was the perfect choice  well done  this must be your mother  mom this is olivier castrostaal my formandspace teacher   its so nice to meet you  and you   this is my friend arthur martin  it is a pleasure and an honour  i know youve had quite an effect on claire  not as much as you have  thank you  what do you think of her piece  i think its very sweet really   its supposed to be disturbing  it is  great art often provokes controversy  and if i may i also feel the image is quite tender  it suggests the quiet dignity of eternal love  would anyone care for a refreshment or an hors doeuvre  no thanks  ill come with you   you think theyre fucking  no  im sorry if that was weird before  it was a little confusing   i didnt tell nate wed met  but you did know who i was at the spa   no i just figured it out  just now  then why were you pretending wed never met  i dont know i just didnt wanna get into it with him  i think you did know who i was when you came in  im sorry i just wanted to know what you were like  thats weird and dishonest and kind of stalkerish  getting a massage isnt the best way of finding out what happened between nate and me   he hasnt been very clear about it  why does it matter  i dont know  im such a wreck right now  hes pretty good at making people feel crazy not that i wasnt  i am too i think i feel like ive totally lost my mind  what was i doing sneaking around like that its so desperate  its not desperate  its just trying to get something you dont have   you mean nate  you have nate  i think youll have him for ever if you want him  he doesnt love me the way he loved you  he didnt love me  not really  he was just trying to get something he didnt have  hes such a fucking idiot  hes living life  it doesnt feel like plastic  it feels like those shells abalone  i know  kind of makes you wanna build a pyramid to live in   i understand why you wanna leave  i dont wanna leave  im not happy either i wanna blame you but its not your fault  ive known you for so long i dont know why i thought getting married would transform you   it has transformed me  i know i didnt mean it to sound like that  i know how committed you are i just mean it didnt change the way you feel about me   god it did though  not the way i wanted it to  its not fair to you and i guess its not fair to me either really  its good we tried i think we had to try  dont you think we could maybe now just  start from a different place  neither one of us is ever gonna be what the other person wants  this is bullshit this idea of what we want maybe its enough now to just stop pretending   and be like friends you mean  yeah but not just that   and you wanna be lovers still  yeah  without all the pressure to be something were not  but what if its never any good  then well know we really tried  really tried   i feel really relieved  you do i do too  you see these fucking pyramids really do work  sorry  its ok come in  its really nice in here  its supposed to have the same proportions as the pyramids in egypt  i thought it was supposed to be this horrible plastic version of a sacred space  thats kind of a reverse message  like modern life isnt always so bad  i dont know like  even though we feel like weve lost touch with this more authentic history  theres a continuity that we dont even realise  thats really comforting  i wish we never had to leave  excuse me do you know who bought it  fifi rochedale   is that you  no  it isnt  your old cats name was fifi and i dont know where you got rochedale   its the street its your porn name nice  god youre fast   it doesnt make it ok that no one wanted it  i wanted it   i love it  youre in debt  its a good investment  the things gonna be worth so much more in five years   weird  checked all the stalls  yeah and upstairs  what shall we do  fuck it shes got a cellphone she can call a cab  might i remove my glasses   please do  thank you  how weird was it that brenda was there tonight  i dont know how weird was it  she dropped off the face of the planet as far as i knew  what do you think about him   hes pretty sexy  so   so what  do you wanna go for it   really  unless you like someone better  i just thought we were supposed to be negotiating if we did it again  we are negotiating you can pick somebody else  frank made it sound like there are rules or something   like what  i dont know  maybe certain things we only do with each other  like what   i dont know like kissing maybe  that sounds ok  would that be rude to the other person  im sure he wont care  ok lets start with that  thats patrick  what about him  for us no way  why not hes so nice  were not doing it with somebody we know its just creepy  im gonna talk to the tall guy  i thought you were at your sisters art thing  we just came from there  how is this place  i dont know it seems pretty much like a freeforall  i think im not so much a gaybar person is that really sad for me  i think thats really happy for you  mom  darling youre home  im sorry it was too late to stop  honey i bought a painting  all right then  thank you for a lovely evening  i should be getting back now  you can stay if youd like  no i couldnt  i really should be getting back  all right  thank you so very much  thank you  thank you  let us know if theres anything else we can do  thats hard to live with   someone kills herself over you  she was depressed  but he said she was doing fine she was on the right medication  she did it because he left her  its depressing how deluded people are about what love is  wait what do you mean  like its gonna make their lives better  it does a little right  its just not like someone else can change who you are  like this woman melinda  that guy was the only good thing in her life  he didnt seem that great to me  i wouldnt wanna be him right now  me neither  it takes all my heart to keep from giving that asshole in five  a triple dose of this stool softener  it would hurt us more than it would hurt him   how are you doing on the paxil  not great   all i can feel are the side effects  so when are you gonna go see rogers  i should try and stop in this week but i always feel like he has no idea who i am  i go in there for five minutes and he goes down some list  they dont give a fuck they just give you whatever samples came with the best gifts  when i was depressed the only thing that worked was celexa with ativan  i should probably ask rogers  just try it and see if it works for you  you can tell rogers that you saw another doctor while you were on vacation  here  gave you generic  still the machine  i already left a message saying i was coming over  so if she wants me to walk in on more fucking thats her choice  i can do it for you if you feel like youve seen enough of moms pussy for a few days  who could ever see too much of moms pussy  its like a trip down memory lane   really though  i know thanks   i dont even know where everything is  i can come with you  that would help  good   i appreciate you letting me stay here  i have the space  its just until i get my client list back together  stay as long as you can stand my friends  is kenny still over here all the time  you know what hes not that bad  he used to come into my room and fart on my pillow  he was ten  get up  i cant believe how much money ive spent fucking up my life   did you ever find out who bought your piece  yep   was it your mom  i wish  you wish who could be worse than your mom   it wasnt my mom was it  no  it was olivier   thats flattering  im sure its just some kind of head trip  why  to teach me some kind of weird lesson or something   what kind of lesson  like he owns me  his whole power thing  maybe he just really liked your piece  kind of doubt it  tickles   i fell asleep  its ok   is it late  its not even five   is maya  shes fine shes sleeping   how long have you been here  i just got here  what  nothing  im just happy to see you   you are  yeah  im happy to see you too
