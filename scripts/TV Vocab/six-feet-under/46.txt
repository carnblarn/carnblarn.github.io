new beginning  do i know this person  no  so what do you think of it  being like a beginning  not much   what do you think it all means  ok  heywood jablome  heywood jablome this is a tough one  the obvious answer is that he wanted to blow me  sure  freud would say that on some level  he wanted to blow me whether he knows it or not  i dont recall freuds position on the heywood jablome phoney message  how do i know if hes conscious of wanting to blow me or not  that is the question  it is and it is an important one  i dont know i guess i could make some sort of pass at him  what do you think i should do  are you still there   i dont want to do this any more  what  us this having sex with other people  we said if one of us was uncomfortable  we could stop doing it i want us to stop
