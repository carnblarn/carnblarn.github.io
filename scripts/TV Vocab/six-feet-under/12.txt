fuckedup thing billy does  you need to do something now  do you think that was easy for me just cutting him off like that  do you even comprehend what its like  to be responsible for someone your whole life  do you even get the concept of loving somebody that much  yes i get that concept  hes sick  hes not just sick hes dangerous  he built a bomb he broke into our hotel room and took pictures of us in bed   whats he gonna do next time  i took his key away from him  yeah well he didnt have a key in vegas that didnt keep him out  im sorry i know you dont trust your parents  but i really think theyre right on this he needs to be somewhere  this is so not how i need you to be right now   what are you doing  i dont wanna discuss this with you  in fact you know what why dont we just take some time off  you dump billy so now youre gonna dump me  dont you fucking analyze me  you might as well throw away your key because i changed the lock  wheres claire  well she claims to be at a movie but what do i know  nobody ever tells me whats really going on  that boy who got beat up on the street  was he doing something  he was getting cash didnt you read the paper  yes i just thought you might know more about it  do you like the hen  yeah very much what did you stuff it with  chestnuts bread crumbs celery  do you wanna know all the ingredients  no thanks  are you going out tonight  no not tonight  are you  me no  but you know  sometimes i do see hiram on occasion  and i know you dont like that  but i also know you love me no matter who i see in my private life  well thats good mom  whyd you drop jazz vocals sophomore year  because the music teacher was a crackhead  im serious claire  so am i he got busted and fired and then jazz vocals was discontinued  do your homework  what happened with the literary magazine  censorship i wrote this totally like harmless  like cartoon story about this girl who can make peoples heads explode  and apparently it was too disturbing to publish  the debate team  they debated what the prom theme should be  i mean god the people in this school they have the mentality of teenagers   you are a teenager  yes  but i actually think about things beside trying to figure out  how to puke after lunch without anyone noticing  so what do you do for fun  i dont know what do you do for fun  i go bowling with my friends i take hikes with my girlfriend   i bake  you bake  your turn  i read  i go online and make up freaky cyber identities  you know sometimes im a scientologist  sometimes im a young christian wife  what about friendships that are based on the truth any of those  sometimes i hang out with parker mckenna i kind of like her  even though shes pretty much a splitpersonality freak  dating anyone  dating you mean like getting drunk and screwing   lf thats what it is  yeah thats what it is no im not  keith got a minute  yeah sure whats up  i wanna put you on security for the marc foster funeral on thursday  okay why  the wackos turn out for these things   why me  come on keith  youre a good smart cop and you use your head  before you use your gun all right  so it has nothing to do with the fact that im gay right  what do you wanna do sue me for discrimination  or show up and protect this kids family  oh god i look like something chef boyardee makes  so you never told your parents you were gay either  oh please they knew  i just didnt want my dad making me feel guilty about it all the time  maybe he couldve accepted it if youd given him a chance  you heard him he thinks its my fault im dead  thats not what he was saying he was saying its a sick world   im the one who was sick  shut up  so i liked men i never shouldve given in to it  its not what god intended  i couldve had a family and a normal life you couldve too  that life wouldve been a lie and unfair to your wife and children  who wouldve hated you  not if i never looked back  not if i had faith  god challenges us like this so well choose good  so well triumph over evil  only thing is so few of us do  its not a choice god already made the choice for you  thats just liberal propaganda to justify your own depravity jim  no matter how nice you fix me up im still going to hell and you know it  because youre going there too  brenda pick up the phone  dont just lay there and say fuck you  okay im sorry i pissed you off i know youre under a lot of pressure  but so am i  so lets talk about it okay  call me  hey  yes this is fisher  sons can i help you  im terribly sorry  yes we can pick up the body the deceased  which morgue  a residence okay whats the address   robbie  oh im sorry did my tree hit you   do you have a moment  well i dont know ruth  i got a whole big bunch of ferns out back i gotta cut up  so you can make some more of those beautiful oneofakind arrangements  how did you tell your parents you were  into flowers  well it was obvious from the beginning my first word was perennial  how did you tell them you were gay  what makes you think i am gay  just because i have a refined aesthetic  you make assumptions about my personal life  im so sorry youre not gay  yes im gay  but i certainly dont see how thats any of your business  do i ask you about your intimate sexual life  even though it is on full display in the workplace no i do not  i tolerate the repercussions but i dont pry  im sorry im asking because my son  oh dear lord save it for geraldo  someone in the family shows signs of homosexuality  and suddenly its a national crisis coming out to my parents  honestly why dont you tell me the most horrible moment from your intimate past   it was horrible  its none of your business  im sorry i offended you robbie  that is a shitty place for the lily  mr jacoby  oh fuck  jesus billy you fucking psycho  did i get you  come on man its paint why arent you laughing  i dont think its funny  oh no its just plain fun  you know if you mix up the letters in funeral you get real fun  how much do you love that  you stay away from my sister shes just a kid  now thats kind of ironic dont you think you telling me that  whatd they tell you  they tell you i made a bomb  they tell you who it was for  i know you wrote things about your family  liar  dont fucking lie to me  he thought he was such a genius everybody thought  he even had brenda fooled which blows my mind  well okay she was young   are you talking about dr feinberg  no trevor you fucking moron  trevor perfect fucking trevor  he thought he was the king of brenda which is such adolescent shit  as if you could know somebody for a few months and replace their whole life  their family  brendas not allowed to love anyone as much as she loves you  able  shes not able  you know what youre right  bren never even told me about trevor she doesnt trust me  you dont get to call her that  you call her brenda  you know she broke up with me today   really  yeah took away my key  well its probably for the best  you and brenda was never a good idea  yeah tell me about it  listen i gotta go so you take care  hey  hey   ready to go  yeah just  give me a second to recover  still bad huh  its just fucking tiring trying to act normal all day  i know what you mean  so whats the stupidest thing anyones said to you today  packy walker told me that he once had to get his stomach pumped  because he ate his dogs deworming pills  he thought they were ludes  well isnt it comforting to know that being miserable  is still better than being an idiot  all right  you wanna hear the most horrible moment from my intimate past  no sister i do not  i was married to my husband for 30 years  i never slept with another man until i started having sex with my hairdresser  and the first time my hairdresser friend and i had intercourse  he asked me to pleasure myself so he would know  you know how i did that  and i couldnt  because i had never pleasured myself in my life  i was 52 years old  and i had to learn how to  masturbate  from a hairdresser  oh my  oh my  well ruth thank you for sharing that  but im still not gonna tell you about coming out to my parents   why not  because i never did cupcake  my daddy wouldve never spoken another word to me  and my mother wouldve just gone insane right there on the spot  how do you know  a child knows what his parents need him to be  my mother is one of those women that never did anything but raise children  so if you came out wrong like the opposite  of what she was trying to make you into then you know  her whole life is a failure  im not like that  did he ever actually threaten you  telling the new boyfriend you wanted the old boyfriend dead  while youre playing with a knife yeah that seems like a threat to me  how come you never told me about trevor  its such ancient history  you said youd never been serious about anyone  i was 18   did you love him  yes  so what happened  billy got sick  trevor went to yale without me  billy got rid of him because he was jealous  everyone was jealous of trevor he was ridiculously gifted  one of those people everybody secretly hates  because hes good at everything and always gets what he wants   well he didnt get you  oh please he could do better  he did actually the woman he married won the national book award last year  you know youre ridiculously gifted too  you could be one of those people who has everything  if you dont wanna deal with this i might have to wanna call your parents  well you might have to wanna call my parents  but unfortunately theyre in south africa at the moment  i have absolutely no idea how to contact them  would you stop fucking around  i love you and im sure whatever you feel about me  you dont wanna see me dead  are you okay  no  do you want me to take you to a doctor  what now you think im crazy too  no no  goddamn it why are you shutting me out  i just wanna be alone okay  i just wanna go to sleep  well good night  why didnt you tell me about your relationship with gabriel dimas  i guess i just wasnt in the mood for a lecture on inappropriate friends  what makes you think id do that  well some people dont think hes the greatest influence  and what do you think  i think that im as much of an influence on him as he is on me  so its not like it only goes one way  right  relating to another person is a way that we relate to a part of ourselves  its like hes like an extreme version of me you know  i can see that  but what hes going through its so much more  but i understand you know  feeling like youve got this shadow over you all the time  whats your shadow  death i guess  death and silence  is that crazy  whats the silence  i dont know its like sadness  or fear maybe  its like you know everybodys so scared  that theyre gonna say the wrong thing  because like you know when you bury someone  thats like the most sensitive time in a persons life  so its like my family theyre just so careful  its like they almost become invisible  that was heavy  whats going on  nothing im just being a freak  you dont have to be afraid that youll say the wrong thing  thats just it im not  i mean i do say the wrong thing  but its like this is gonna sound stupid  but like i talk so much shit all the time you know  and thats just another way to not say  whatever  to not say what  im not here for the school or for your mom  im just here for you  this is confidential right  gabe didnt od by accident  he did it on purpose i think  well most ods arent really just accidents  right so what can i do as the friend of a person  who would do something like that  like i know all the i cant save him stuff and i went to the websites  and its all like what you cant do so what can i do  try not to make yourself invisible  this isnt about me  thats not a very good start is it  at least my tie can be straight right  you shouldve left me the way i was  let the world see me for who i really am  an abomination of nature  shut up  who you are is nothing to be ashamed of  thats a little hard to buy coming from somebody  who cruises for dick on the internet and has unsafe sex with prostitutes  they made a shrine at the place where you died  with pictures of you and flowers  people go there and hold candles in your honor   what people  your friends your community  bleedingheart faggots with nothing better to do  guys who fucked me when they were drunk and then never called me back  there are people who love you  but not as many as hate me  and you  nice job  man that is the best work youve ever done david   thanks  nice very nice  hey theres like 200 homos outside oh shit  already its only a quarter of  youd think the family wouldnt want all of that coming in here you know  all of what  theres this one guy hes dressed like jackie kennedy  you think this guys mother really needs to see that today  howd you get those abrasions on his cheek so smoothlooking  i used diaper rash cream you left some  you know rico im a homo  i may not dress like jackie kennedy but i have sex with men  dont dont talk to me about that all right  why should i hide it from you you change your babys diaper in my house  you show me a videotape of your wife giving birth  where i come from  if men need to do that sometimes  they dont talk about it  they dont leave their families theyre men  i am a man  so i took the height of tree a and divided it by the length of shadow b  so do you see how i got to tangent c  since when were you such a trig bitch  dont get me wrong i know its totally pointless  just somehow teaching you makes it seem more interesting  it must be the power  well you are  a very stimulating teacher  i love your grasp of the material  well maybe we should grasp the next one  which one  number five  come on   what is it  oh nothing  allergies  hey come on  im scared  its okay  im scared too  im scared youre gonna disappear  im not gonna disappear  what are you scared of  im scared im not gonna finish my math homework  hey i told you  im scared that you  are too good for me  oh youre crazy  i finally find a woman i wanna commit to and she makes it totally impossible  you think thats a coincidence  what is that supposed to mean  maybe if she made it easier you wouldnt be so eager  i need more garlic  youve always been bored with the girls you could have  and fascinated with the ones you couldnt  yeah well whose fault is that  your brothers gay isnt he  i think thats a question for him  has he told you  no he has not told me  but its obvious everyone knows  am i supposed to say something i tried to discuss it he wouldnt let me  i guess he doesnt wanna talk about it  its not good for him to skulk around like that  hes very tense its not good for him   breathe mom  i know how to breathe  i dont appreciate you blaming me for all your problems thank you very much  your carrots are burning  haven t you seen a little girl called bunny   about your age  no   a new girl  no  with a dress just like yours  look theres no point in questioning the children  what are

towel  we just have to get yours now  this way youll be safe from her too for the first time  then we can bury them and you and i can be new people  and we can forget about everything bad that they

agree with them you know  like it is my fault and i should be able to fix it   theres nothing to fix  but its not who i wanna be  i wanna be the guy at church with the kid on his knee  you can have a kid on your knee david  that guy probably hasnt slept with his wife in five years  i feel like my father would hate me if he knew  you told me he did know  and he never said anything  did you  would

because its your job your duty  it revolts you but you make yourself bear it  well youre wrong you dont revolt me  i dont choose which part of you i love like some kind of chicken  it was just so much easier when you were little  and you would tell me everything  and when you were upset i could always fix it  i dont know how to take care of you anymore  just let me  just let me take care of myself
