out of everything until i discovered the miracle of low even heat  the secret is mesquite wood chips do you use mesquite  thats just a gimmick its the marinade that makes all the difference   i just like wearing the apron  nate  where did you put her blue blankie she cant sleep without it   i didnt put it anywhere  i couldnt find it   did you give her mr fat fanny  hes in her sweet little hands  all right  i think were ready  good let me go wash up wheres your little boys room  the bathroom is in the back behind the kitchen  dont flush the toilet we dont wanna wake maya  so hows the choir

man  he had a wife and kids asshole   lucky him i didnt have shit  whose fault is that  you couldnt show up to work on time  maybe if you hadnt been such a prick  its because of people like you that i had to do this  what are you saying this is my fault  im just saying a guy can only take so much before he snaps  hey we all have to deal with a lot of shit all right  but when i snap i throw something or punch a wall  i dont pick up a shotgun and start killing people  yeah so far  god it feels so good to sit here and do absolutely nothing  we relax all the time we have to  how do you like your new job keith  well it pretty much sucks  its temporary were both going through a lot of changes right now   all good though  hows the therapy going  good were not fighting so much  we never really fought that much but were getting along much better   nate and i never fight  never   no  you two have never had a fight   not really  i dont know how you do it  weve known each other for so
