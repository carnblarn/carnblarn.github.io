                why didnt you accept the complimentary map of the trail  ive done this hike a hundred times before  youre the one who insisted on making a left at the last marker   because the other way didnt look like a trail  that was the trail  fine  everything in the entire world is my fault  not everything just the fact that were now totally lost  and im totally dehydrated  if you were so sure about the damn trail which you werent  then why didnt you  what is that down there  i told you there was something  you never believe me you get just like your mother   no i dont  yes you do just be honest for once  oh my god  somethings moving   somebodys in there theyre trapped  no theyre not  must have driven off that dirt road up there  its been sitting here for years  why would they have an accident and just leave their car to rot  maybe because theyre still in it  ok im fading i cant even keep my eyes open  i need to get a cup of coffee   you fell asleep on the phone last night  i did not  i was talking for 30 minutes straight  and i was thinking its so good to get these things out  and then  im sorry  i havent slept in three nights ive been devouring this camille claudel biography  remember me saying my brothers getting married on saturday  to the woman with no chin  thats right so i didnt totally bore you  i know its kind of last minute  but i was thinking if you werent doing anything  i mean if it wouldnt be completely painful for you  to come with me  its not a date it sounds like a date but its not  ok its a date you can be my date  sure i mean  why not of course ill go with you  ok it got weird didnt it  and i did it  i hate life  claire i really like our friendship  and i would never  whats with the chittychat  you can focus on your work or you can gossip like old blind women  its your decision  finally you draw what you see not what you think you see  i like it  claire you and i should talk  look everything i do sucks today i know  this isnt about your work   thank you  of course  youre not gonna believe this olivier asked me to be his assistant i start tomorrow  i dont believe this  i feel like i just won something i never win anything

hardly remember how he took his coffee  i myself like the deluxe aegean  its a little on the high end but its very calming  its like a slow lulling ride on  on the aegean i guess   i need to sit down  take your time  we know how hard this is for you  he  went out for a newspaper one day  and never came back  so i figured hed deserted me  which made sense because we were one of those horrible  got married too soon for all the wrong reasons couples  now i find out  he didnt run away at all  he died in a freak accident  what am i supposed to do with all these years of feeling like he deserted us  honey we dont even need to do a funeral its just an empty ritual  actually the closure it provides is quite powerful  and quite healing  the strange part is where they found him in that canyon  it was ten miles from where we lived what was he doing there   maybe he got lost  right  looking for a newspaper on a dirt road in the middle of nowhere  do you think he was seeing someone else  i have no idea  he could have been  diane lets make a decision on the casket and get out of here  will was jewish so  the sampson  its plain cedar got it  i can finish out the week if you need  claire you got another job go do it  its an amazing opportunity  to learn from olivier castrostaal maybe help him with his art  do something meaningful instead of just you know  fine i wasnt crazy about you doing pickups and deliveries anyway  we have enough actual employees here  ok thanks  wait this is for you  whats that a goodbye gift  its a box of bones i just picked up from the coroner william jaffe

looking to improve my interview skills  fair enough  it was between you and judy lindeman  we just thought you would fit here better   based on  well  there was something in the way you talked about your grandmother  my greataunt pearl  she was a very special woman  i barely knew my parents they burned to death in a fire when i was five   im sorry  aunt pearl gave up everything for me   she

this is tom jaffe   william jaffes son  i didnt realise he had a  look im so sorry for your loss  i was only a few months old when he  when it happened  i never even knew him  tom was dropping off some of his fathers belongings  seems strange considering that theres no real body  in situations like your fathers it helps the family to put his belongings to rest also  i hope thisll do  was your father a little person  no this was the only suit of his that my mother could find  it was in some box his family had  its from his bar mitzvah  and theres this it was in the same box it either belonged to him or my uncle  my mother thinks she remembers my father liking blue bayou  im gonna get fired if im not back by two so if thats all  yes well see you tomorrow at the funeral  whats wrong with you  i dont know  can you imagine being so calm about your fathers death  he probably thinks of his stepfather as his real father as he should  he doesnt know anything about his dad not a thing  whether he even liked linda ronstadt  do you know if our dad liked linda ronstadt  as a matter of fact i do  in his record collection there was a copy of a heart like a wheel  here are the teacups and these are dinner plates  those up there are for casseroles  and these are the cereal bowls  please feel free to use any of the dishes  is there one i shouldnt use  silly that one was davids special yellow bowl  he got upset when anyone else used it im sure he wont mind any more  lets not take the chance well keep it out of rotation  thank you  now you see the chart i made  each meal time is divided into two shifts  one for each of us  so we never have to suffer the awkwardness of eating at the same time  thank you thats very thoughtful  we just sign up each day for the one we want  so my dinner can be from six to seven  or from seven to eight  exactly which do you want tonight  ill take seven  actually ill take six  oh good i had a late lunch  just use that pen there to initial it  of course other people also use the kitchen  if you want to make a schedule with them feel free to use my system  laundry facilities are in here  sunday nights are off limits im sorry but thats when i do my linen  yes maam i understand completely  i should make a note about not aiming the shower at that tile  no need its all in the little booklet thats hanging by the sink  what a lovely room  such warm light  it does the trick  second drawer sticks  unless you lift as you pull  thank you thats very kind  all right thats the end of the tour   youre on your own now  thank you  nate  oh my god   what are you doing here  i shoulda called first  i was afraid youd  i need to talk to you  it wont take long  i wouldnt ask if it wasnt important  i dont know ive got a lot of errands today  can i come with you  please  it seems like i just got this smogchecked last month  i called you when i first got back into town  couple of months ago  i hung up when you answered  i just wanted to make sure that you were alive  im sorry  after everything we went through  to not even know if youre alive thats  sad  but apparently your surgery was a success right  yeah  well the avm ruptured in the middle of it and all hell broke loose  but they fixed it  thank god  use your fucking signal woman  you can go up my ass  claire  i once had an affair with an older married woman  her name was astra  that means star did you know that  have you ever committed infidelity  no not yet but someday hopefully  infidelity is not funny claire its tragic all betrayal is tragic  i was 21 when we first met the radio was playing  i wear my sunglasses at night  such an insipid song  but now it always makes my heart feel  squished  shes beautiful  shes the best fucking thing that ever happened to me  so whats gone on with you  went to santa fe for a while i was in austin texas  couple of weeks in tahoe but i really hated it  what were you doing there  just trying to find a place to make me feel better   are you still living in venice  im staying at my moms  hows that  its the hardest thing ive ever done in my life  bad news your car didnt pass   i can fix it but ill need about half an hour  all right  totally fucks up my whole afternoon  you know i saw a place up the street we could get a drink  so whats your life like  youre married a father  its great  its really great  im glad  you so deserve to be happy  after everything youve been through  i mean its hard sometimes  you know relationships arent easy  really  you just have to work at it every day  cant expect everything to be perfect all the time  cant get shaken when it isnt  and if theres a moment where i feel like im in prison  i just have to think about all those moments when it feels safe  and remind myself that those moments outweigh the prison moments  being alone is the prison just thinking about yourself  just being trapped in this vortex of always watching yourself  which i suppose is ok if youre interesting  truth is nobodys that interesting  listen to me  lets just talk about movies or something  i havent seen a movie in a year  anything else  just the check  ah fuck  so bren whats this catchingup session all about  im not sure  actually i am sure  this is so difficult  i apologise  for having sex with other people while being in a relationship with you  for not showing up to our shared reality  by altering my consciousness with various substances  but you already apologised  youre making amends   i hate that word  still doing the whole 12step thing  im doing a lot of different things  my life is  complicated right now  yeah well whose isnt  no let me  thanks  i dont even know if shes alive now  all i know is that before i met astra  i was consumed by this passion to create  a passion i seem to have lost  i was never really in love with her  of course you were  you ripped a jasmine bush out of the ground and put it in her car  i had just had my first real success and all eyes were on me  what was i going to do next i was a coward  i focused on another person  i could have been great  and so can you  if you get lonely have sex  but if you meet somebody who you think means something to you youre doomed  car 438 do you receive me  yeah go ahead  alarm going off at 5636 fremont place  got it im on my way  youre a little late  insider job mustve known the owners were away  got the jewellery upstairs and the cash box in the library real clean  you boys gonna be ok closing up by yourselves  i think we can handle it  fucking cops  think theyre such hot shit   dion corelli  keith charles  you were hoping for some action right   yeah i guess so  i know that feeling  how about i buy you a drink   is that comfortable  i dont know when i got so clumsy  i never used to be this way   i think its too tight  no its fine  it was so strange i put my finger right on that nail when i heard you coming up   id seen it sticking out of the wall  why didnt you tell me about it  it was almost like somebody pushed me  like some kind of invisible person wanting to hurt me  and earlier in the day i twisted my ankle coming down the stairs  i was looking for you or something it was around four   couldnt find you anywhere  i went out for a drink  with brenda  why  she showed up i was running errands she came along  getting a drink is an errand  what did she want  to apologise for being such a crazy bitch when we were together  actually it was pretty decent of her  what lisa it was just one beer  i really dont appreciate finding out about it after the fact  its no big deal but next time please tell me first before you go do it  im supposed to ask permission  no but you couldve said i want you to meet my wife  then said you were gonna catch up with an old girlfriend  youre right  im sorry  relax guy the owners are in antigua theyre not gonna mind   we shouldnt be doing this  come on  we deserve it  its not like were gonna get caught  were the only ones who would catch us  this is some place   i bet the people dont even appreciate it  probably not  no one appreciates what they have  especially the ones who have more of it  fucking rich people  what can you do  dont you ever just wanna  that felt so good   what the hell are you doing  lets fuck this place up  those idiot cops didnt check in here  well go to town and say the robbers did it lets break some shit  teach those rich fuckers a lesson   youre crazy  come on guy you know you want to  cut it out  cut it out  jesus  you did a great job tonight david   you were amazing  dennis  can i borrow you for

the sears bathroom  honey i know it was you  i never forget a face  god it feels so good to say it i dont know why i wouldnt admit it yesterday   it just seemed so  sleazy repressed not that pretty  something like that  that time for me was so difficult  i mean really difficult  i tried to compartmentalise that part of my life but you cant  sweetie you dont need to explain it to me  i dont know why things have to be so hard  i think its because we make them that way  so  you ever jerk off anyone else in the chorus  of course not   you  a couple  so if let you up no more crazy stuff  no sir  holy shit man  you didnt have to play so hard  i was just blowing off a little steam  get your things and get out of here  you ever a cop  whatever you are  you got a lot of shit to deal with  i could
