pen once  i wasnt speaking literally  oh heres a good one  old but recently reopened   youre so full of shit  well were all wounded  we carry our wounds around with us throughout life  and eventually they kill us  things happen that leave a mark in space in time in us  im sure this is all very deep and profound  but you know i get enough depth at home  youre supposed to be my haven away from all that  im not supposed to be anything  morning dave  arent those the same clothes you had on yesterday  everything i own looks alike  i sense youre not being completely honest with me dave  have you

outside your pod  shut up asshole  thank you claire  why are you still here anyway why dont you go back to seattle  because i would miss the joyful sense of belonging i get here  i have no idea what kind of service hed want  well at this scale it depends on who he was  and how he saw himself the statement that he made with his life  he was like so dynamic  he had his own business beauty vision   from the infomercial  chandler invented it  large scale  ill arrange viewings for tomorrow and the next day  interment at cedar hill service for 200  now we should choose an appropriate resting vessel  one that befits a man of his stature  may i ask what kind of car your husband preferred  he drives a bmw  do you know which model  the biggest fastest one  i recommend the titan series  solid mahogany panfinished with burwood accents  the same wood used in luxury automobile interiors   it looks expensive  nine thousand  its more than just a casket its a  tribute really  okay   are we finished  a major credit card to get us started  hi  i nathaniel samuel fisher a resident of los angeles county california  declare this to be my last will and revoke all former wills and codicils  first to my wife ruth  i leave all bank accounts stocks and bonds that are in my name  thats in addition to the life insurance  second i bequeath the company fisher  sons funeral home  and all real property and business interest attached as follows  fifty percent to my son david james fisher  and fifty percent to my son nathaniel samuel fisher jr  what  what was he high why would he do that  david   wow i guess i dont even rate  no he set up a trust for you  david  hey wait david  david david david i dont want it  well excuse me while i go contemplate the irony of that   whats my recourse

not just to succeed but to survive  okay spare me the toughlove rationalization just bottomline it please  should you decide not to go the money will become available to you  when youre 25  so this is like blackmail from beyond the grave  what in the hell was dad thinking is this some sick joke  its fisher and sons youre the sons  mom gets half a million in life insurance  which is fair but i have strings attached   lets not talk about whats fair  have my half  no your father knew exactly what he was doing  he wanted everybody happy and we will be happy  i guess what i want is totally

california  and were inviting you to be 158  you should discuss the situation with your son david   i have two sons  really i was only aware of one  i know how many sons i have mr gilardi  yes maam

hollywood know where that is   you mean right now  yeah  id love to but ive got a dead body in the car with me  i can certainly understand why you wouldnt want to get away from that  come on just a glass of wine   do me a favor keep it out of the sun  yeah sure  i had forgotten they make these noises  the air comes out its like  no  dad knew that i hated this whole fuckedup business  he should respect that  well poor dave id be pissed too  although he does seem to take it to this extra old testament level  so does this mean youre not going back to seattle on sunday  fuck  okay dont think about it tell me about yourself  like this is our first date and we never had sex before you knew my name  you mean the recap of major life events  told in a humorous and selfdeprecating way  which almost always gets me laid   no  why not   im not that guy with you  who are you  i dont know somebody new  its because of your father  youre with me at your most vulnerable  you felt comfortable you felt really accepted  you always analyze guys on the first date   only if theyre interesting  oh so you think im interesting  yeah i dont meet that many men with dead guys  with hardons in their car  when mrs swansons credit card didnt go through i ran a check  and they were in debt up to their ears  we have a 3200 titan casket being delivered tomorrow  why didnt you tell me theres an offer to buy us out  i knew what you and dad thought of kroehner service international  you dont know what i think  not that it matters to you  and nate is not your enemy hell do whatever you want  why do you say that he spent his entire life doing what he wants   dad mustve really hated me  hush  its fisher  sons thats gotta continue and youre never gonna have kids  well its about time what took you so long   i stopped to eat  i wish youd called  i think mr suarez kind of shit himself is that normal  stopped to eat do you have any respect for human life  i have a huge respect for human life i didnt know they can take a dump   well they can make a note  i dont like this bickering  yeah well i dont like you sleeping with hairdressers  look dont take this out on mom what is it you wanna say to me  well theres a body that spent over two hours in a van  unrefridgerated decomposing at a rate much faster than you could ever imagine  thanks for making my life just that much more difficult  thanks for undermining my authority with our employees  and thanks for making it clear that my choice to dedicate myself  to this business and to this family was really stupid  apparently i would have been rewarded just the same for wasting my life  oh my life is a waste fuck you at least i enjoy it  yeah well lucky you   dave at least let me help  youve helped enough  its just not fair that my life is being decided by other people  hey college is paid for  they have great parties no student loans to pay off  im not exactly a party person  by the way that shit you gave me  the night my dad died it really fucked me up  im sorry about that  you should be  just why is college the only option i dont even know what i wanna do  i just feel like theres something inside me  id just like to figure out what it is before i get completely reprogrammed  hey nobody could reprogram you  youre the most original girl in the school  come on look at this car that you drive  this face that you drive   thanks

what  do you have to be anywhere tonight  not really  the other mr fisher recommended the 9000 coffin i didnt ask for it  i think cremation is much more dignified  and its within range given the financial situation  chandler created beauty vision  we have franchises in 13 states and the nation of uruguay  how much did you know about your husband  because hes been running up bad debts for some time  we were always moving i thought it was  because he was making so much money  each place was nicer than the last  former partners are suing him  he had several credit cards maxed out  runins with the irs dating to 1996  and yale university would like him to quit telling people he went there  this cant be happening  i have a baby i cant go back to waitressing  and now youre telling me that we cant even afford a coffin  what will people think  mrs swanson im sitting here thinking why dont you rent it   how much would that be  how much do you have  i dont know my atm cards not working  well

9000 retail item  our cost is 3200 we eat that and plus we lose the profit  wait theres a 6000 markup  mr suarez we cannot let you have that casket   sorry to hear that  we cant legally sell it
