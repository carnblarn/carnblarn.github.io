outlook on things   did an old lady spit at you  no  i mean yes actually but it doesnt matter  but thats whats so great about what you do or aleksandra mirs work  it happens to people its not just some image hanging on a wall doing nothing  i think these images are doing something  is this because carolyn reamed you out for being vacant  no i want to make work that does something   we should make something together  like what  like some kind of mixed media thing in some space people have to be in   like an elevator  bigger  like a mall or something wed invite artists who make totally different kinds of work   wed do things while people walked around  to make it unavoidable   yeah  i totally love that  hey rich  oh good  george hello  ruth this is the famous dean kekalos howard

their minds back and forth these people  the mother wanted one thing the wife another calling all day changing the casket   so i shouldnt have cancelled cassidy  can you get her back  i hope so   hear him going on about global warming  no  he was making the point that we dont have enough oil left in the earth  to generate the emissions to create a greenhouse effect   was one of your exgirlfriends at the party  i dont think so  a very thin woman with a mysteriously international accent  i did date a lady from the archaeology department some time ago  and how did it end  gosh i dont really remember  did you lose cell phone reception and never call her back   did somebody tell you that  did you  i have no idea it was a long time ago  it couldnt have been that long  as i recall we just drifted apart  thats not how she recalls it   did you talk to her  i happened to overhear a conversation  thats not the best way to get information now is it  in any case the greenhouse effect will definitely come to pass  if we start to burn coal as oil supplies dwindle over the next 20 years  but i dont think even we could be that stupid  hey  hey  how are you doing  fine   how are you  ok

upset with you  what have i done to you  you embarrassed me in front of your entire family instead of confronting me directly  i did confront you directly you made it clear you did not wish to be confronted directly  that is completely untrue i answered every question you asked me as i always do  you pretended not to remember something that happened less than a year ago  you forget things that happened yesterday  look ruth  the past is not important to me  i just want to be here in the present with you  yes but there was a time when you wanted to be in the present with that woman at the party  she had no idea you were going to leave her  she went from being in the present to being in the past without realising it   you are really starting to sound hysterical  what changed for you   with that woman or your first few wives  it doesnt matter  it does why would you leave so many  because they asked too many fucking questions thats why  a very outgoing girl named sophie she said  oh sophia yeah shes a young mother from church that im helping  a young mother from church  i told father deegan i wanted to do charity work he gave me this family to help  you know like a big brother thing   how come you never told me about this  it was just between me and the father  and this outgoing young mother what kind of help are you giving her  just like cans of food old clothes and toys and stuff like from the fishers  youre giving her stuff from the fishers but ruth doesnt know  no no she knows she just doesnt know that sophia is the young mother in need  i dont know why you would keep charity a secret   its the way youre supposed to do charity  come on you tell your wife  well the truth is  this is something i started doing when you were  you know not that easy to tell things to  when your own family needed you you started helping someone else  sometimes it makes your own problems seem less bad  when you help someone whos got it even worse  hey  hi  what are you   whats up
