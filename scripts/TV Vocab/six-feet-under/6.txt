sorry  its okay  so jim  what do you like to do   can we sit down  sure  had a little too much to drink there jim   you okay  yeah  i want to apologize for what happened yesterday  its okay  i should never have lashed out at you like that its  i dont know whats wrong with me l  i was holding a saucepan the other day  and all of a sudden i remembered making creamed corn in that pan  some night when it was raining outside  and both the boys had colds and my husband was on a call  picking up a body  and then yesterday i was cleaning out the cabinets  and i found a jar of baby food in the very back  strained carrots from when claire was a baby  that jar had been sitting there for over 15 years  i am surrounded by these  these relics of a life that no longer exists  were here for the jones

school again today  not really  come on claire youre what 16  what do you think i am a pedophile  well  i dont know what you want me to say  i dont want you to say anything i just thought you should see it  well ive seen it  so dad traded a room for a funeral no wonder we never had any money  didnt dad ever say anything about this place  dad and i never talked about anything but work  thats exactly the relationship you and i have  nate people are allowed to have private lives  so what if dad had a secret room  i dont care if he brought women here to fuck  i dont care if he brought men back here to fuck  you think we should tell mom about it  sure why not you wont be happy until this whole family is in therapy  thats kind of a leap  i know youre pissed off about a lot of shit  but i didnt make any of that shit happen right i abandoned you  well you know what im not your father im not the one  whose responsibility it was not to abandon you so get over it please  life is just too fucking short  thank you nate i appreciate your honesty  wrapped as it was in such a bouquet of condescension  if i were you id pack this place up before they start charging us rent  quite a hottie huh  this is mom  you have no idea how beautiful she was buddy boy  i have no idea who you were  i really wasnt that interesting  no i think you probably were  i think you were this great guy who was funny and weird and high  i was just always so afraid of everything you did  death  i made the decision to become a fucking undertaker because i thought it was  something you believed in now i find out  you think running away is the best thing i ever did   maybe  i kept us from selling to kroehner  and im taking the funeral directors license test next month  maybe i was just covering up for how embarrassed i was when you left  is that why you left half the business to me   to get back at me  maybe  maybe i wanted to see if you had the balls to go against me  or maybe i really wanted you to have it youll never know  goddamn it when are you gonna stop fucking with me  when are you gonna stop caring what i thought  i never knew my father  get over it please  life is just too fucking short  my brother is a very complicated man  and very highmaintenance  dont get me wrong i love him dearly  but i pity the woman he ends up with  see thats the same thing id say about my brother  nate is not even in the same league  was i crazy  i mean billy was really acting like  did you fuck him  no  well you dodged a bullet there  is every man alive a total asshole  at some point or another then again so are we  come on we gotta go  i still cannot get over the fact that you are charlotte light and dark  you have to because its very irritating   mr jones is still downstairs  i know  this silver has been in your fathers family for three generations  i dont believe ive ever used it  im going to put an ad in the paper and see if i can sell them  mom i found something you probably should have   where did you find these  in the office among dads things  look at what a child i was  your father was leaving for vietnam  hed volunteered as a medic  your grandfather was furious  you dont remember your grandfather do you  no  he was a very unhappy man  and he wanted everyone else to be unhappy too  we were all living in this house  you were a baby and there was no privacy so  nathaniel and i got a room at a motel  some seedy place in the valley  and we made love like maniacs  like it was the last time  your father took these pictures  in that dank little room  told me he kept them in his pocket in vietnam to protect him  its frightening how much we change  are you staying for dinner dear  yeah  mr jones probably should think about heading home  youve got a long day ahead of you tomorrow with the funeral and  mr jones  mr jones  mr jones  oh shit
