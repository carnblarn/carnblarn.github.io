but im not convinced you know what it means  and also im not making out with dennis later  cause it says were supposed to do that at the end of the song   and thats not going to happen  im not sure if im comfortable with that either bro  well this is why i didnt think you should be playing the boy okay  i dont want you guys kissing either  what if its just a sexually charged embrace  okay artemis

and take it away from charlie and ruin his hopes and dreams  so let me tell you something dee let me break down a scenario for you  i could cut the song okay because i wrote it  i could have artemis do the song okay because you did not write it  or i could strap on a wig and i could do the song myself  so you tell me little miss all that what do you want to do  song or no song  song  song   yeah

talking theres no rape scene  well sure i pay the troll toll and then i rape dennis  no you dont rape him you become him   you do not rape him  he doesnt  no look let me just walk you guys through this okay  heres what happens once you pay the toll  i want you to come over to dennis over by his bed here okay   ill be lying back  you want me to cross the stage   yes  all right this is a great opportunity  to showcase some skills and like just put on a clinic   i would rather you didnt  well i think the people are gonna want to see that  and then ill hop up sort of like a cat like so  jesus christ just leave it at that  okay once he gets near you you have to sense him okay  suddenly you sense him  what if i were to position him in a way where i get behind him  and then frank could throw that blanket that hes got right there  over us and then that way you cant see the penetration  thats a good idea you know what charlie  because the blanket will make the rapings im sorry   the sexing from behind feel more classy  thats good  and what i can do is thrust this way and you can struggle  now im here okay i am im past where i thought i could go  im like all the way up here with it   oh
