you would not bring up the helicopter  youre not the boss of me so quit  technically charlie i am the boss of you because i own half your shares  since when you sold me half your shares of the bar for goods and services  wait a second youve definitely given me half your shares too  maybe i gave you guys a couple shares when my back was against the wall  and i needed a little breathing room  you gave me a shitload of shares for a half a sandwich  what are you guys doing is this a hose job where youre hosing me down  you hosed yourself down you hosed yourself up and down charlie  what do you want me to do i dont care get a job  oh get a job just get a job  why dont i strap on my job helmet and squeeze down into a job cannon  and fire off into job land where jobs grow on jobbies  now were wasting time will you get outta here  you know what im walking i cant stand you guys  whew now that we got rid of that dead weight lets come up with a strategy  whats your plan im thinking if this fat cat is not gonna woo us  then we gotta woo him  yeah uhhuh  i thought you guys were taking me to dinner  come on who doesnt like to watch a naked woman swing round on a pole  gay man for one huh  im gay no  youre so big and tough you do not come across as gay  you dont look like a gay guy thats cause hes a bear  huh hes a bear  some gay guys are twinks and others are bears this gay guys a bear  by the way were totally cool with that to each his own  wait im a little confused here whats a twink  a twink is small and slender like mac  no im too muscular i would be a bear  dont think so not hairy enough  smooth i would be a bear  see i dont think youd be a bear either  i dont know what you would be youre definitely not a twink  id be a top thats for sure maybe  can a twink be a top or is that reserved for bears  im sure theres a great deal of switching back and forth  but i think more often than not bears are tops  unless they happen to be power bottoms whats a power bottom  a power bottom is a bottom that is capable of receiving an enormous amount of power  actually you got it backwards  a power bottoms generating all the power by doing most of the work  does the power have to do with the size or the strength of the bottom  dennis ive heard that speed has something to do with it  speed has everything to do with it  the speed of the bottom informs the top how much pressure hes supposed to apply  speeds the name of the game right buddy  goddamn it  now that you have your silverware all set out  youre gonna need to refill all the ketchup bottles in your sections  ooh that sounds like a whole thing  know what ill do if they start to get empty ill just grab some from other tables  no because then someone else is doing your work for you  yeah which makes my job easier  thats not how we do it here  you actually have to follow the rules were very strict  which means you probably shouldnt be drinking beer while  you probably should get used to it because im gonna do it anyway  dee perfect there you are look i need a  hello this is a surprising turn  hello charlie how you doin this is good  you working here or wow look at you you cracked the case  why are you here
