                you better have a good reason for getting us out of bed this early jerk  i got a goddamn great reason for getting you out of bed  this bar is hemorrhaging money  you gotta spend money to make money economics 101 dude  youre bleeding us to death  especially with that company credit card you got  that is for business expenses frank everything on there is a business expense  who spent 500 for laser hair removal  right over here slick dont want to have hair down there you know what im saying  who spent 5000 for a samurai sword  your head of security  yeah just wait till he saves your life one day with it  6000 on a camcorder  well i decided what im going to do is im  going to take all those hilarious characters that ive  been creating over the past several years to put them on tape  im going to put them on youtube  that way i can get discovered by like a casting director or  a producer get some kind of a tv development deal  yeah right so the point is frank is that these are all business expenses  i mean some are definitely more realistic than others   yeah not that one  no not at all  but nonetheless it was i believe bought as a business expense  theyre not business expenses  what i bought is a business expense  what i bought is something thats going to save our asses  okay yeah all right   what did you get  i bought a billboard  its alwayssunny in philly 403   okay so im thinking  we write on the billboard in nice big letters we have  twoforone drink specials on thursdays  and on the bottom you have a hilarious picture of green man  kicking someone in the nuts and people will go hey whats this wacky place   where can i have those drinks  it is really astonishing how bad your idea is   how is that a bad idea  go sit down  the adults are working the adults are working  when we need a child well call you  dennis you and i on the same team hot chick up on the billboard   sex sells boom  absolutely  its advertising 101 long legs taut breasts and tight poopers  im just going to jump in here real quick and point out  that this is the point in the conversation where i would volunteer  to be the girl on the billboard and then you guys  would talk about how ugly you think i am and compare me to   some sort of giant bird  you look so much like a bird   dennis i was thinking fish recently  really  yeah her eyes are so far apart theyre like theyre
