in this city where do they go   uh theyre at the velvetrope clubs on delaware avenue  why  dennis our bar is in south philly in a scary alley   might as well call it rape bar  no no no  the problem is that every time a beautiful girl comes into a place like this  its always the biggest asshole that winds up accosting her  carmen you have the most amazing body are you bulimic or what  no i work out like every day   yeah it shows  you look like you work out too  yeah one would think actually  but its pretty much all natural  dennis maybe you need to rethink this whole plan of yours  i dont think getting charlie laid is gonna help his cancer problem   whatever  dennis i found the perfect girl for charlie   smart beautiful the whole thing  where   right there  over by the pool table   yeah nice  thats great mac   good work mac  thats a dude  no the one with the exposed midriff and the cans  yeah thats eric wyzotskis cousin carmen right   yeah  yeah carmen   tranny  implants   yeah  nice

that hes been in love with forever  yes  well okay he saw her wearing one of those lance armstrong race for the cure  i love people that are dying of cancer type bracelets   thats really cool  well so
