hard to say  you know because we start it  in so many ways  seamus perhaps you should start by  kissing her neck lightly  no no because uh   we dont kiss  we dont kiss   at all  no kissing  thats unusual but okay  okay tell me just tell me what you are into  i like to watch so im going to bounce off the bed   and observe  okay  see you see what just happened dee  seamus has just communicated

gotta come clean here because weve been lying to you  deandra just think about what youre doing  im sorry weve been lying the reason is  we havent had sex yet  because were waiting until we get

a licensed minister  so why dont we just do a wedding like do it tomorrow  ive been thinking  and i should never give the money to an unmarried couple anyway  okay  family and friends  were gathered here to  to share in the declaration of a lifelong commitment  between this man and this woman deandra  do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband  i do  seamus do you take this woman to be your wedded wife  you betcha  well then by the authority of god  and the laws of the great state of pennsylvania  i now pronounce you man and wife  congratulations deandra  you made me so happy
