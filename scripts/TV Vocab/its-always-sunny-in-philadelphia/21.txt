met in one hour im going to kill one of the hostages  you hear that  in one hour were going to have margaret shoot one of you in the face  and if any of you try to escape well massacre you in a blaze of glory  then play with your bodies especially dennis  lets secure the perimeter  holy shit  did you hear that i think he means it  theres no way theyre going to get those demands  they cant get a planet hollywood jacket those places dont even exist anymore  they dont even make those jackets theyd have to call stallone or something   hes not going to give his up  maybe ackroyd   theyre not going to part with theirs  shut up  we need to focus okay this is serious  we could get stockholm syndrome  oh my god what is that what is it  does it start with a sore throat because i think i might be getting it  no youre not getting it charlie  im sorry you a doctor i dont think youre qualified  to tell me whether or not im coming down with stockholm syndrome  stockholm syndrome it messes with your mind  you start to empathize and then you could side with your captors   we could turn against each other  dee is right  look we need to watch out for each other okay  the only way were going to get through this is if we stick together  nobody has to die   somebody has to die  oh yeah   it doesnt have to be one of us  no it shouldnt be  it may as well be mac or charlie right what do they have to live for   not one thing  so we need to form a pact  no matter what happens you and i have to stick together   you and i will form an alliance  well form an alliance  dennis is going to try and have you killed  i cant say that surprises me  hes going to sell us all down the river  okay should we kill him first or something  hey look i dont want anybody to have to die but if somebody does   theres no reason it shouldnt be dennis  it should be dennis right   he had a great life  oh yeah sure   he had a full full good ride  oh a fantastic ride   i had a terrible ride  charlie you had the worst ride   i had the worst ride anyone could  you deserve another shot at the ride   i want a better ride  oh you ought to ride and ride  so listen heres what we do  you and i no matter what we got to stick together  we got stick together we should get to mac though before dennis does   mac will be with us  mac will be with us  frank frank come in frank  the mcpoyles have taken us hostage and

real map theres no fake map idiot   jesus christ  are you kidding me   this is just unbelievable  how could anybody like it this hot   i feel woozy  this is bullshit  a couple of glasses of milk lukewarm skim for the lady   look we dont want your milk liam  then start breaking bricks wet nips   you know what i think youre full of shit  is that right  yeah thats right i think i can walk out of here right now  and i dont think youd do anything cause i dont think youre serious   you dont think im serious  no i dont think youre serious   now you think im bluffing  i think youre bluffing   you think im bluffing  i think youre bluffing  than bluff this ryan stab somebody  what have you done man give me the milk  showing em were not bluffing  damn youre supposed to stab one of them you stab one of them  i got to take care of this   oh shit  my bad   oh my god  one of the most terrifying things   i mean  ive ever seen in my life dee  that must have taken so much heart you know to stab your brother like that   i mean that is real dedication  what  whatever okay look i think we need a real plan here   the hours coming upon us okay  yes yes  oh look maybe i can corner one of them all right  ill manipulate them get inside their head  and have sex with them  have sex with them no i was going to say pit them against each other  what i know  what what did i say   you said  no  oh god no those guys are disgusting  dee i think youre starting to show signs of stockholm syndrome  no listen im fine all right  can we just focus here just tell me what the plan is  lets focus okay heres the plan  i know i can get the girl to fall in love with me okay  now i know im not one of the members of her family  i got that going against me but  i do have a secret weapon  boom all right  i just need to get alone with her and let the pecs do the talking  one thing will lead to the next shell lead me secretly to safety  mac whats with the goddamn heat  im roasting like a suckling pig up here  uh yeah man its getting pretty hot up in this piece huh  must be miserable up in those vents frank  charlie is that you  yeah its me  hey are you lost i warned you never to go up in those vents without me  uh yeah a little bit  hey charlie  you think you could give the walkietalkie over to mac  i got to talk to him privately  yeah hold on a second  yo buddy im here  mac go somewhere where youre alone  okay frank were alone  whatever happens make sure charlies the first one to die  what why  because of this will business he stands to gain the most out of it   thats a very good point  thats an excellent point all right  uh thats a good plan frank ill get back to you in about ten  all right get back to me tenfour  okay well i think its pretty clear what we should do   yeah  frank has to die   gotta kill frank  gotta kill him somehow  so once the mcpoyles take out dennis dee and frank  yeah  then you and i will split the money right down the middle  thats kind of a lot dont you think   ill tell you what  no what  ill give you 25   hey ball sacks put those on  why  its too obvious who the hostages and who the captors are  were gonna confuse the cops  all right your time is almost up  and we thought wed spice things up with an immunity challenge the team who wins  will be exempt from the first round of shootings in the face   oh thats a great idea  dee shut up   what the hell is she talking about  shes got stockholm syndrome  no i dont  no i just think its a good way to decide who to kill first  im trying to put myself in their position you know  its called compassion dickheads  maybe if you guys had a little bit of it  you wouldnt be in this mess in the first place  and then we wouldnt be standing here trying to figure out  which one of you we have to kill but  thats where we are so hand me that shotgun  cause id like to do this mess myself  get on your knees bitches  what are you doing now youre on their side  you wanna be a mcpoyle trash bag  if you wanna be a mcpoyle youve gotta earn that the hard way  and you will learn that later on but for now the challenge is this  whoever can destroy more things on the inside of this bar wins  and the teams have changed  its now dee and charlie versus mac and dennis  you have one minute to plan your strategy  starting now  ooh come come here come here come here  all right look man i think i got a plan to get us out of this  but i need you to do the destroying the bar thing can you do that  no problem im a great destroyer  are you kidding me dude youre a born smasher   yeah im a born smasher  all right all
