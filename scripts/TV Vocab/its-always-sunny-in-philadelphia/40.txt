                oh its just so doggone thin   oh its incredibly thin  yeah its thin sure  but i got to say i dont care for it  charlie the thinner the tv the better the tv   thats just a straightup fact  guys guys guys  check it out we got a review in the paper  no way is it a good review  the first thing i noticed about paddys pub is its charm   all right its a good review  thats a good start   it has none  uhoh are you serious  there was an ominous feeling that you could get stabbed at   any moment thats good right  how is that good  thats the exact type of atmosphere ive been trying to cultivate  but while danger may linger im the levelheaded bouncer that  keeps violence in check like swayze in roadhouse im the cooler  in check there have been many stabbings in here   i feel unsafe here every single day  oh very often  well stabbings have been down though  read some more  when i ordered a glass of wine not only did the surly  white trash waitress refuse to make it but she proceed to  call me a word that i cannot print in this paper   surly  i was forced to listen to  the three classless bores who call themselves the owners  get drunk and yell over each other all night  classless bores i am not a classless bore  well i am not white trash i am a kind and a generous  and a goodnatured lady  well i i do seem to remember you calling a guy a faggot  yeah i absolutely called him a faggot but he ordered chardonnay  what was i supposed to do  having reviewed every bar in philadelphia i hereby  officially declare paddys pub to be the worst bar in philly  its always sunny in philadelphia 4x08   hi are you mr lyle corman   yes can i help you  good nice to meet you  were here from paddys pub and we have come down to give  you the opportunity to give us another chance  yeah heres the thing we felt that your first review was just a   tiny bit off base  yeah as you can see  were not white trash  huh really well uh then in that case  can you ask your friend to put down that hammer please  uh yeah dont let the hammer throw you corman  we are classy interesting people  okay im afraid im gonna have to ask you to leave  well dont be rude we just came to have a talk so  this is a private im gonna have to get security  okay we can play it that way corman  but you should know that we would have no problem suing you  suing me what are you gonna sue me for  uh libel slander theres two of the big dogs right there  its only libel if what i write is false  you know what buddy we will jam your asshole up with so many lawyers  you wont know what to do with yourself  ill have you know we have a team of lawyers on retainer just  to deal with people like you   really  yeah  well check this out   youre all out of time bitch  boom   you just got fazed  this just in poopoo pants  people dont read newspapers anymore  hows that for class  nice brandnew bluray dvd player all hooked up   hey all right  where are we gonna put it  we need like a flat surface  here we go you know what well just well dangle it  that looks better were not dangling anything thats very white trash  what is the point of having all this expensive new status  symbol stuff if were just gonna make it look terrible  hey you guys want to see something  what  i did something  holy shit  what you kidnapped corman  i dont really know what happened okay  first i was angry then i was drinking  next thing i know im following this guy home and forcing him   into the trunk of his own car  jesus christ this is bad   really bad  dont panic dont panic  relax i drove him around in a circle for a while okay so  he wouldnt know where he was or how far away hed gone  but then you brought him back to a place where hes already been  and plus he just heard everything you just said  okay maybe we can just release him and that way this wont be a kidnapping  first things first lets just get him out of the trunk  lets get him into the bar and then lets figure out what we need to do  how are we gonna get him in the bar without anyone seeing him  easy we roll him up in a rug   where are we gonna get a rug  we buy a big oriental rug  and we roll him up in it  do you have any idea how expensive rugs are charlie   yeah especially oriental rugs  no no rugs  just get him out of the car and into the bar charlie  help me get him out of the trunk  okay so were were really sorry about this mr corman  watch your head  youre gonna be okay its not a kidnapping so  oh goddamn it  okay i think were on the same page   this is not a kidnapping  no  no okay all right  but we do need to keep him here for a couple of hours   so he doesnt do anything irrational  just borrowing him  go to the police  that being said lets take a few precautions here okay  we need to cover our tracks why dont we shoot over to cormans place  and make sure that charlie left without a trace  im pretty sure charlie left with a trace   he probably did  thats a good idea  okay and ill use my cooling abilities to smooth things over   with corman and then that  jesus christ  are you still going on and on about being a cooler   shut up  the cooler thing isnt helping now  just get into the bar and make sure charlie doesnt do anything stupid  okay but can we establish that im the cooler   oh my god  get into the bar  were surrounded by idiots  look this really isnt necessary you dont have to tape me  im sorry man but this is the situation were in and i  just feel like this is the best thing to do here  jesus christ dude what are you doing you cant tape him up like that  come on man i mean the guy gets my goat man  he sits around all day he judges people with his words  and his fancy newspaper talk its bullshit  what is it that you people want  well ill tell you mr fancy pants writer man  i was thinking maybe you could write a new review you know  and this time maybe add a few less lies  how can i write a new review if i am taped to a chair  come on man see hes twisting everything i say around  hes making me look like an asshole  okay look look nobody has to write anything against their will okay  thank you  i have to go to the bathroom   i have to pee  okay sidebar  how is he gonna pee if his hands are taped down  i dont care let him piss in his pants  no he cant piss in his pants charlie  i dont know why youre so in love with this guy  i just dont want to get arrested for kidnapping   if we just untie him for a second  not gonna work  i used the last of the tape  if you untie him that tapes not gonna stick back up  go down to the basement see if theres any more tape  ill take him to the bathroom ill defuse the situation   fine  play it cool   play it cool  play it cool  im sorry i yelled at you mr corman  i saw that  i saw that i saw that youre out of here bro  what are you doing  what im packing to make it look like corman went on a vacation  yeah but youre all over the place you just put in a tropical shirt  and now two heavy coats i mean  is he going to cancun or canada you gotta pay attention to the details   this is how people get caught  ah shit youre right  im leaving a trace okay no no no no  hes probably under a lot of pressure with the deadlines from the newspaper   he should relax  go someplace tropical   cancun then perfect  tropical  you know what ill do  i will put an outgoing message on his answering machine   that is good thinking sis  were pretty good at this  we are pretty damn good at this were learning  greeting one  hi this is mehar sorry i missed your call  please leave a message after the beep peace  that did not sound like corman  who are you people   friends with corman  yeah  mr corman lives across the hall   oh does he  does he  where is he this is ridiculous   i really have to pee  i hear ya bro  now back to the cooler conversation that we were having earlier  i feel like in your article you missed an opportunity to mention  my bouncing abilities okay  now its really more about smarts than anything else  for example if there was an altercation in this bathroom  i would blast in looking to neutralize yeah  now i would check out my environment and i would look to see  if theres anything that i could use to my advantage  like this pool cue here we go  okay normally that wouldnt happen unless i wanted it to  cause i could fire it right in your chest cause i got skills to do that  dude theres like no tape anywhere  all i could scrounge up was a bandana  no thats too small  oh i could wear it though i should wear it  i know but i found it so i sort of feel like  no i appreciate you looking for me and finding it for me  no hang on a second  that got me to the point of me getting the bandana  oh youve got to be kidding me  just please get me out of this bathroom before i vomit  it is absolutely disgusting  well excuse me mr man  but i happen to think this bathroom is pristine  because i work very hard cleaning it  in fact its so clean i would say you could eat out of these urinals  no you absolutely could not eat out of these urinals   oh really whats this  charlie dont  char oh my god dude  bro i really i just pissed in there   like five minutes before you came in  dont say that   now youre gonna make me look bad  spit it out man youre gonna eat it   youre still chewing it  i have to prove a point  all right all right just let me go to the bathroom  i will write the review ill do whatever you want  i promise  well now that wasnt so hard was it  great awesome  well i think that were were in good shape then  how are we gonna do this  well i think one of us is gonna have to help his  whoa dude im not touching his dick  well charlie youre the one that used all the tape  well i was comfortable with letting him piss in his pants  well all right fine then compromise  well both do it that way its equally weird for both of us  no no no fine justjust untape me  please no oh no  no no  can i bring something up   did he get a little bit hard on us  can we not talk about this  i just felt like you got a little bit  it was very weird   well why did it move  hey guys   we got a problem  we did something   oh man  oh man what happened dude  well there was this a slight mixup with the apartments  this is cormans neighbor mehar  what happened to doing this without a trace  well itits a long story but the punch line is that   he starting asking questions  i asked one question   shut up  no you asked a lot of questions  all right well lets not have him ask more questions  lets just keep him in the trunk for now  you cant kidnap more people to cover up the original kidnapping   its a classic mistake  im sorry  i didnt know there was a handbook on kidnapping   help  we gotta get him inside   its probably very hot in there  theres another bit of an issue  which is that i locked the keys in the trunk just now   what  yeah   are you kidding me  well i didnt want to bring that up  goddamn it charlie  this is what were gonna do you guys  deal with the situation out here  lets go talk to corman hes writing that new review  okay cause i dont want to see that man right now   we dont really want  because we had a whole thing  what happened  something happened none of your business   thank you very much  we had a thing amongst the   lets just go inside  can you just please  how long do you think we can hold that inside  its burning me up inside its burning me up  there he is our little typer   type type typing away  dont mean to disturb ya  oh youre not disturbing me at all its great to see you two again  i get it i get it   you are too much huh  youre being a smartaleck   you are  glad your spirits are still up  listen we wanted to come in and just let you know were sorry  about this whole tieupandholdyouhere thing  we didnt have anything to do with it  no that wasnt us that was somebody elses idea   not our idea  you know what im saying  now if theres anything though that we can do   since we are in this situation  absolutely together we are   you want to let us know  anything at all  yeah how about uh letting me go  there he goes again   i didnt know he was so funny  i didnt know he was gonna  ask for food or something  is there something else we can get you though  cause clearly you know we cant  all right a glass of white wine maybe a chardonnay   now youre talking  you like white wine i know that  um also do you want me to bring you some lipstick with that  boom you got fazed again corman  you cant just tee her up and expect her not to take a swing at you right   cant blame her for that one  cant blame her for that one  hey since you are writing a new review uh  is there anything i can do to help you out with it  uh you want to fire a couple questions my way   no i think im fine  okay yeah hey no problem man  i just want to  just want to make sure you got the total picture on me  cause i do drive a range rover   gas guzzler  well not on the highway okay  yeah its very classy vehicle though

person  i dont know give me something i can work with corman  all right dennis  heres the deal i didnt feel like opening up a bottle of wine  so i brought you some scotch  cause i feel like thats what writers should drink  hey some topshelf scotch  uh i dont drink scotch  well you dont have to be a dick about it  got a real chip on her shoulder this one  if i had to write an article about you it would say that youre very negative  the headline might be most negative man in the world  calls other people white trash to make himself not feel so faggy  faggy  you mind if i just took a quick peek at your new review there   uh but i havent  thats okay  thats okay i know youre not finished  i just want to see what direction were headed in there buddy  whats it say  its uh pretty heavy on the kidnapping aspect  it is  you jam in further though  this is unlock the bottom  im going for whatevers down there and um  it wont catch on to anything is the problem man  damn it dude i feel like this should be easier  people break into cars all the time  you know a piece of me wants to chalk this whole  guyinthetrunk thing up to a loss right now dude  we cant do that bro we gotta get him out of the car  well then why dont you just let me take the hammer  and smash the window and well just pop the trunk  charlie if were gonna smash the window  i would simply do it with a roundhouse kick  oh

up in my neighbors bed with a head wound  yesterdays paper and an empty bottle of sleeping pills  and my nightmare in that putrid shithole of a bar paddys pub  finally mercifully came to an end  the owners all deserve to rot in jail  though having to spend every day with each other  in that violent establishment is a decidedly great punishment  that is why i decided to not press charges  leaving em to live in the hell on earth that theyve created for themselves  for the rest of their pathetic and miserable lives   really cold what hes been writing  its wrotten there   not a good review  no its not a good review  right for the throw  at least he didnt mention our names  no charges no names  i dont know why but im a little irritated that   he didnt mention our names  i feel like hed to mentien our names  i increadibly annoid that he didnt mention our names  i whish i can live with this but i cant  its a history about us   i feel like we go talk to him again  we should talk to him   were capable of being civils right   lets just you know  communication is the key it make sens  uh my hammer again
