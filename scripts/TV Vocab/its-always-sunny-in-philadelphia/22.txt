know  because im going to peak so hard  that everybody in philadelphia is going to feel it  im in my prime  and i bet you that i could sell these dresses to fatty mcgoo  just based on these sketches alone  and your loser friend is going to buy them because shes a fatty  and thats just the way of the world  all i have to do is turn on my winning charm  and fatty mcgoo will be putty in my hands  cause us winners always win  he wasnt talking about you  i think he was   its too streaky  where  everywhere fix it  well im trying frank  ive never spray painted a chair before okay  why are you covering your mouth  because that lead paint is extremely toxic  what is that why im feeling so dizzy  hey all im hearing is excuses and i still have a blotchy chair  wait a second wait a second what am i saying what am i doing here  youre making my chair look like it was dipped in gold  now get back to work  nobody is stupid enough to think that your chair was dipped in gold  frank okay why am i helping you  because im manipulating you  thats the way i get people to do things for me   really  yeah  shit thats awesome how did you do that  if you make my chair look really nice i will tell you  deal   i got it  a drink yes good good good  excellent listen man i need to use your business connections  to see if i can get like a really cheap sewing machine  why  well cause dennis and i are

the operation  its not an operation dude  look i just want your help getting a sewing machine  whoa wait  has that chair been dipped in gold  so we would cinch it up nice and tight through the waist giving  a nice subtle lift to the top of the dress and keeping those  fat tummies in check gorgeous   okay dennis im confused  whys that  these are just pictures of women with giant breasts  yeah  and in some of these sketches the women arent even wearing clothes  yes  well why  listen let me level with you  youre an attractive enough girl i mean certainly youve got some  potential all right  theres no reason for you to be so nervous around me  why dont you just order a couple of my dresses and  maybe if youre lucky ill even make one special just for you  and if you look good enough in it hell  i might even consider having sex with you  how does that sound  terrible  all right lets just calm down  youre youre having a reaction thats understandable  its the nerd in you talking why dont we start over  how many of my dresses would you like to order  none not one  okay well  im not gonna take no for an answer because i  i just refuse to do that because im a winner  and winners we dont
