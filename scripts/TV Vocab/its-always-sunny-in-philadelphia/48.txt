and   okay no problem  all right  thank you great oh shes terrific   i like her yeah shes a cutie  all right now listen mac  i did bring you here for a specific reason okay  i got an idea for a stimulus plan for the bar thats gonna blow your freakin mind   stimulus plan  a stimulus plan you want to hear it   lay it on me bro  take a look around you right now  now at a time where businesses are simply failing left and right whos thriving   dave  busters  dave  busters is thriving  why do you think that is   uh i dont know videogames  video games are definitely a big part of it  i want you to do me a favor break down for me what im holding in my hand right now  ah that is a dave  busters power card  yes now does your dave  busters card work at any other similar establishments like say   tgi fridays  mine does not  believe me ive tried at several locations  okay well yeah cause if you recall ive actually been with  you on  many of those occasions where youve tried  right i dont think ive tried it enough  i think you have because clearly at this point  you shouldve realized that it doesnt work anywhere else  theres one out in franklin mills i havent tried  its not gonna work there either okay  lets move past it im trying to make a point here  when you come to dave  busters you spend your real money  but you leave with dave  busters money okay  that gives you incentive to come back to dave  busters  cause its the only place where your money works  i think thats brilliant now maybe we should take a page out of dbs book  and try the card at the fridays out in the northeast  no you son of a bitch were way past that at this point  i dont understand why you  cant grasp that point  it doesnt work anywhere else its only gonna work here  all right im im getting all worked up okay lets just lets  im proposing that we print our own currency okay   make our own money  yes  and we call it paddys dollars now we  distribute that out to people for free initially  and then they become customers and then they bring in new customers  and then once theyre in they have to  use real dollars to buy paddys dollars  thats exactly right and that  stimulates our own internal economy  yeah dude thats a great plan and then  afterwards well go out to fox chase    and use the power card at that  fridays out there  yeah yeah yeah  no we wont you can though  so look mom um i kind of come on some  hard times with the economy and everything  and i got no place to  go and everything so  i was figuring maybe i should  move back into my old room   for a little while till i get back up on my feet  well i dont think thats  gonna work out charlie   why not  i had to sublet your room to uncle jack  is that why hes here  hey charlie  times are tough and the economy is so bad  i need to get more money in  in order to make the house payments  what are you talking about you dont  make house payments you own this house  youve owned it for years  mom thats crazy you collect social security  i need money  you can share the  room with me charlie   thats a great idea  that is not a great idea   well why not  itll be fine you and me palling around  getting nuts doing  crazy fun things  im not doing any kind of things that you  want me to do with you uncle jack you know  no itsits stuff that relatives do   well share the room charlie  i dont want to share a room with you dude  because ii will spend the  whole night wide awake   just like when i was a kid and  you tried to share my room  you ever seen  wrestling on televesion  im well aware of what wrestling is its just not what uncles do to their nephews  im out of here   hey ill call you later  i know you will   just grab any knife  get the sharpest one in the kitchen  all right now when i cut through  the shoe and make the sale  you suggest casually that we have a drink to celebrate and  then i drop a little wine on the  carpet grab the wet vac and then  call it a deal whatever  this is the best knife i own  all right well thats the best you have  all right now pretend that this shoe is an unboned chicken  and youre gonna cook it tonight make a tasty dinner  its gonna smell all through the house like cooked chicken  actually im vegan  okay then pretend this shoe is whatever you people eat   maybe it is a shoe  nice one  watch the way your knife cuts  oh its just flopping around  its like not even making a dent in the leather  this knife is a piece of crap  now take a look at our knife  beautiful pressed steel   with a nice razorsharp edge  watch the way this knife blasts through this shoe with one motion  is this part of the whole  i cut myself oh oh its a deep cut   i see your bones  its a deep cut   ill get you a towel  oh frank  its okay its all right i got bandaids in my bag  i just i need your bathroom   okay i need to just get my bag  okay  okay   is he gonna be okay causecause  yeah no no hes gonna be fine beth  dont worry i tell you what why  dont you and i have a glass of wine    just bring it down a little bit huh  i dont drink in the morning  yeah me neither  oh shoot oh oh im missing it   oh no  youre doing that on purpose  im trying to prove a point here beth okay hmm  im gonna  okay i  oh boy  goddamn it  these paddys dollars  look great bro  yeah im really glad we  went with the color they pop   a little bit more expensive than i wouldve  thought but thats worth it though  thats an old poor move  you take your money and you put it into something worth it  youre not tacky   see by transferring all of our cash into these paddys dollars  and then printing more of these babies than we ever had in cash  weve upped our value  shit  ah goddamn it  fullblown shantytown were screwed  wait a minute wait wait wait wait wait wait dude  there could be some real opportunity in this   yeah  yeah man  think about this dude in recession times  what thrives more than anything else   prostitutes  no well yeah   but that and bars  oh and bars  right because people got to drown their sorrows   get drunk  we own a bar  so why dont we take these paddys dollars  and just distribute them amongst the shanties   that way  they buy the booze from us with the dollars  right and then they run out of booze then they   got to buy more paddys  dollars from us  thus creating the selfsustaing  economy weve been looking for  it stimulates our economy  thats what dave  busters does  give me one up here  who wants some free  money shanties  when people stop buying vacuum  cleaners and knives door to door   it could mean only one thing deandra  that you blew all of my money on a very stupid idea  no goodbye recession hello depression  youre very lucky that youre with  somebody as resilient as frank reynolds  you tried to off yourself two times in the last 24 hours frank  well listen this business partner of mine called  hes got a great plan this is the man  whos going to make us rich   this is the man  yes   this man lives in a cardboard box  times is tough  goddamn it  hey   thanks for getting down here so quick  its charlie   charlie  charlie is your new business partner  yeah well what do you want i mean were good in tight spots  thats right all right you ready to do this   you got it  okay lets go  youre the man with the plan   lets go  deandra this is going to work  here we go  look at that   feast your eyes  there we go  what the hell is that  these are crabs fresh local delaware runoff crabs  those dont look anything like crabs they look like sea scorpions  isnt there some kind of like  sewage runoff around here  you know crabs is sewageproof  and depressionproof people got to eat  were gonna sell these on the street  were crab people now   crab people  were crab people now  you want us to become crab people   thats your new business plan  yeah  im getting a call  well live and die  by the crab dee  well eat off the fat of the sea  hey will you help me toss some of these babies back  cause legally were not  allowed to eat those  oh thank you very much thank you  great news lets go forget the crabs  okay   nice doing business with you huh  all right shanty    enjoy it  all right enjoy yourselves  hey i think we made every single one  of our paddys dollars back buddy  youre damn right thus creating the selfsustaing economy weve been looking for   thats right  how much fresh cash did we make  fresh cash  uh well zero zero if youre  talking about us currency  people didnt really seem  interested in spending any of that  thats okay so uh so  when they run  out of the booze theyll come back in  and theyll have to buy  more paddys dollars   right  keeping it moving  that is assuming of course that  they will come back here and drink  they will they will because well  redistribute these to the shanties  thus ensuring them coming back in  keeping the money moving  well no but if we just redistribute these  then people will continue to drink for free   okay  how does this work mac  the money keeps  moving in a circle  but we dont have any money all we have is this   how does this work dude  i dont know  i thought y  i thought you   what i thought you  were on top of this  youre the one that  came up with the plan  i did   did i come up with this plan  last night dude   with the db power card and the  i blacked out i blacked out that night   shit dude ive been following your lead  oh jesus oh shit  okay okay we have no  money and no  inventory theres still something we can do  thats still a business somehow  how does dbs do it theyve got  a complicated system worked out  and i cannot begin to understand it  how does a selfsustaing economy work  i dont understand how  the us economy works  much less some  sort of selfsustaining one  i dont understand  how finances work
