into it  and now since im his next of kin the house belongs to me  frank if you want to get your house back check it out  make a vision board put your house on it boom   you get the house back  what the hells a vision board  oh its the secret  yeah the secret is a selfhelp book that dee read and explained to us  its about how you can get whatever you want without having to work for it  yeah man all you have to do is envision all the shit in the world that you want  cut pictures of it out and paste it on a board   and then you get it you get the stuff  check it out  see how i got all these

barrier   well that could be an issue  well no no no no  no hold up uh somebody took a couple years of spanish in high school   okay you rember  im gonna dust off the cobwebs  and see if i can fire off a couple phrases  tell them um to relax first off cause they look a little tense  and then uh were gonna build them a new house  and a new life just like on extreme makeover on tv  okay okay

what man the more i look at this place  the nicer i think it is you know its a nice place  no its a very charming charming place   what are you doing dude  what do you mean   why are you smashing stuff  i smashed it  its important that we get rid of anything  that will remind the juarez family of their old country  bro theyre americans now americans dont hold on to the past  oh the past isnt useful you got to forget about it   okay the past isnt  we got to gut this entire place  heres what im thinking now after we got done smashing all their  old shit im thinking we take out this wall you know what i mean   just let the room breathe a little bit  okay and you think thats better than just like   ripping the whole house down just  yeah why   tearing the whole thing down  were you planning on destroying the entire house   yeah  we cant demolish the entire house  thats what they do on extreme makeover   they rip the whole house down  do you know how to build an entire house   no i dont know how to  i know  well i hadnt thought that far we would have to build a whole house   yeah we would have to build a new  i cant build a whole house  you know what lets just smash the one wall  and then well throw a couple layers of paint up   and then well get our lamborghinis and  okay good  let me see if the lamp takes a little dent out of it  and here comes the pitch   oh it didnt really dent the wall though  no but it did break the lamp   and thats part of this  it did break the lamp   im gonna break this  whats  whats all the racket down here  hey some of us are trying to do some work here frank  i dont know if you noticed  has anybody scored on their vision board yet  how on earth can we score on our vision boards   we just started  yeah weve been doing this for like 30 minutes  ive been sleeping for a day  that broke bastards bed is soft as shit  you think they got any beer in the icebox   i could drink a swimming pool  frank you are a terrible foreman  you know what back me up on this charlie   youre out of here dude  i think so   youre youre done  you cant kick the foreman out  im the foreman i tell you what to do   thats the way it works  oh really   yeah  youre gonna tell me how it works   yeah  i watch extreme home makeover   i know how it works what  charlie  that show is just a bunch of manipulation to get people to cry  and then they trick the viewers into buying shit  buying shit what are you talking about  that show is about how awesome sears is  and how much sears products save peoples lives  and its about caring and sears and  okay im not  now you dont see ty pennington losing his cool   do you want to be like him  yeah  all right well then just breathe for me feel what im doing  yeah dude i just  im sorry bro but i get very passionate about sears  i meanextreme home make i mean what what   helping people  helping people  dont stop  i dont understand why this is happening  our visas came through yes  i dont think these people are the ins  i think were been kidnapped  baseball  frank what the hell are you doing here  those dick wads threw me off my own work site  so hows the old vision board coming you getting everything you want  no actually we just started the whole makeover process  yeah we realized the reason why the juarez family  hasnt achieved the american dream yet is because they havent envisioned it strong enough  right so were having them do their own visions board so here  why dont you be a lamb and pass out some materials   what  be helpful  do something positive with your life piece of shit  magazines magazines here magazines  and cut them out with this   what are you looking at  she doesnt understand what youre saying  no no you got to say corta that means cut  corta corta  i am gonna blast your face off   okay what did you  no ones gonna blast your face  no ones gonna do that what did you say to her  i said what you said to say to her  and she stabbed me in the leg with the goddamn scissors   deal with it  all right all right okay  lower your cutting tool please  man is crazy with gun  right  and make danger for all of us   yes  okay careful watch it  dont make man hurt you   yes  yes yes   that makes sense yeah  they got it  im really good at this  dennis yo lastminute thing  god i have this brilliant idea  we need a project for him dude  you know we got ourselves a little mexican girl here and im thinking  what does a little mexican girl love more than anything else in the world   tacos  tacos buddy  so why not make for her a taco bed   you know what i mean  okay  she gets to like be in a taco every day  so okay i got yellow sheets thats cheese  green guacamole red a little pillow for salsa  and i got these cute little brown pjs so that she gets  to feel like ground meat while shes sleeping   shes the ground meat in the middle  shes the ground meat in the middle  i like that man thats a good idea  what is this blowtorch for man  well thats a propane torch  that things badass man its like a flamethrower  but what function is it gonna serve in the home  its for the renovation man its for the controlled burns  i dont think they do controlled burns man  are you kidding me bro they definitely do controlled burns   they do it off screen  off screen  how do you think they tear down an entire wall so quickly  they burn it up  the community has got a lot to do with it and then  maybe its for burning the extra rubble  its for tearing stuff down   are you sure we need it  they take stuff outside and  im not sure we  im buying it so go ahead and ring that up  what are we looking at here  that will be 321211  were just gonna go ahead and put all this  on the extreme home makeover account  ring it up  i have no idea what youre talking about  really  were performing an extreme home makeover  so do you not have a button for that  were helping out a family in need okay  were gonna do some good deeds  you know we got a vision board thing going  this is a legitimate operation okay  this is the real deal i got a whole taco bed  you know what if you just give us the stuff well be on our way  im sorry we dont just give stuff away  i dont know why youre breaking my balls here  sears does this okay sears gives people stuff  sears doesnt get anything out of it  sears doesnt come in and start  look we dont have any money okay  what are we supposed to do here  i dont know what to tell you  if you dont have a bad credit history you can open up a store credit card  credit card huh  all right just go ahead and sign right there and were all set  now this is smart  the first step to becoming an american get a credit card  we need this guy to build up copious amounts of debt  that is the best way for him to build up his credit   were doing him a favor  were doing him a huge favor  and do you realize how extreme this is  to go from no debt to good oldfashioned american debt  thats the way to do it  plus ive been envisioning someone else paying  for thing the entire time  im also envisioning him unloading all the shit into the car  well thats a great vision  guys no can do were on a very tight schedule  by the way does anyone know why the hell frank  has been pointing a camera at us  ill tell you why because im tired of this secret bullshit  all it got me was a stab wound in the leg  so im gonna record everything you do   why  because i know youre gonna fail  then i can watch it over and over again   thats ridiculous  whatever frank  you know im glad youre getting all this on tape because  then well have proof of how amazingly generous were being today  youre going to prove that the secret is real  gentlemen we are all done here so im gonna roll cause we got to   thank you very much  lets go ahead and lets do this   mostgracias  good luck  all right you got the store card now  lets go ahead and ring that up  bro im not sure i have the right look here  no you do man  you just got to start thinking of the tool belt as an extension of yourself  it needs to reflect you as an individual  do you feel that   is that all that it is  thats all it is  all right let me ask you a question then  how come you have that awesome fray in your shorts  i dont have that  that sir is becauseyou purchased blue jean shorts  whereas i purchased blue jeans and cut em  thus the fray  its a more authentic look i think thats what youre feeling  why did you cut them so high  way higher than mine  i thought you might ask that  see it limits restriction of leg movement  youre going to get more work done cause you got more leg movement  well are you sure about that  let me do a little demonstration on you  take the tool belt off for a second  let me let me let me just demonstrate something  lets get it down  take a wide stance  take the widest stance that you possibly can and let me see what that looks like  leg movement   this is uh  go as wide as you can  if im going wide and im being honest with you  im maxing out about here  thats not bad but check this out  go go go  any more  thats it but thats pretty wide right   that is good you know  looks good right  and youre not getting any high ride   im getting a high ride  thats a better  but the shorts arent preventing me from doing what i need to do  and thats the shorts  thats exactly right man and see your shorts  theyre holding you back man  that and your hips but i got to tell you the shorts arent helping  this this is really all good shit  this is like gold  so what are you going to do next   you are catching all this right  i got everything  this is what were gonna do next grab me that propane torch   im gonna burn the wall  you know what  lets go at it with the wrecking ball for a little while  itd be more extreme and kind of awesome  okay all right lets do that then  all right you do the wrecking ball thing check this out  im gonna do a little introduction thing   and then you do the wrecking ball  do you want to wear the belt  all right im gonna be the only one wearing the belt  just jeans and no shirt  wait can i see the stance one more time  that i can go lower  bro that is bad ass  yours wedged in too  mines completely wedged in there  we cant even get anything past the surface of this thing  theres like a hard surface past the thin surface  concrete or brick or something  i was envisioning this being a lot easier than its turning out to be   abso  use the blowtorch  great its time  hang on a second   let me grab the flamethrower  hold on a second time out  wait i think i know what the problem is  look im the one who watches home makeover  i think i know what were not doing right here  what  we havent brought the neighborhood in yet  absolutely great idea bring the neighbors in  oh my neighbors are great  so did the neighborhood rob us  did the neighborhood rob us   and they took my goddamn tool belt  i could not have anticipated  look into the camera and cry a little  you have been in our face with that camera man  you know what man you know what  just get me the flamethrower  im so sick of this wall i want to burn it up now  okay its time  theres also a fire extinguisher too  great   i think we should use this man  i think we should too  so heres how this is going to go down   i will light a fire on the wall  on the wall  have that extinguisher ready cause  i dont want the fire to spread past the parameters of this wall  i will create a parameter with the fire extinguisher  its the only safe way to do this okay  itll be perfectly safe  then once the walls all weakened from the burnedup fires  then were going to kick it to pieces smash it to bits  and take the rubble outside and probably burn that too  and then ill put it out with this  perfect and then ill get started on my taco bed  that sounds good  before you do that why dont you open that window  over there and get a nice backdraft  now he wants to start helping us  thats the first sensible thing youve said all day frank  its extreme just like we are  go crank open a window  lets get a backdraft going frank you ready  ive never been ready for anything more in my entire life  well all right  lets do this  i think we have successfully pulled off one extreme makeover  yeah i love their eyes  now while we wait i was thinking we expose them to some  good oldfashioned american cinema  apocalypto  they can learn about how their ancestors used to be savages  until mel gibson and the catholics came in and saved everybody  hey youre just in time  why dont you point that video camera at the new and improved juarez family  they look freaky as shit  wait till you get a load of their ancestors  pop a squat bro cause were going to watch a sweetass flick  i got something better to do  bag em and bring em with us come on  yes lets go in fact  bag yourselves too because i want this to be a surprise  come on right this way  keep walking straight  goddamn its hard to breathe in these bags  okay hold it right here  all right now excuse me  please come over here the family  i want you on this side  my head is sweating like shit  take the bags off  you got you got a bus just like in the show  its all about the reveal  ready  one two three   move that bus  unbelievable  i cannot believe the judge made me give my mansion to the juarez family  i cant believe their name isnt juarez  was anyone else surprised by that  shocker  well you know its a its a broken system we got here  but at least we managed to avoid arson charges right  thats good yeah  frank i guess youre right the secrets bullshit huh  you try to help people and you just wind up getting screwed
