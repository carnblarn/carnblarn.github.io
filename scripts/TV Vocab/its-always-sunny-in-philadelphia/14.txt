moses is about to walk on holy ground   no actually its not  yes it is thats the next line  remove your sandals for the place where you are standing is holy ground  but whats in between the lines  whats in between the lines is that he has to take off his damn sandals  because its sacred ground  no sacred ground sacred ground  god doesnt worship the ground god made the ground  and moses is about to step near a burning bush that is gonna be hot  god doesnt think moses is gonna do it  hey moses kick your shoes off  come on walk around a burning bush  you know thats like asking me to take my shoes off and stand on a hot plate  im not gonna do it unless god asks me to  and then i am just like moses  why whats gonna happen to moses  his feet arent gonna get burned  no god is gonna reward him with some sweetass shoes  its like oh oh you risk your feet you get some shoes  thats the way god works cause god loves us  trust in god hell give you shoes  are you kidding me  youre buying this
