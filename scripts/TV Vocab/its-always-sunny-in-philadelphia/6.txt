yeah no absolutely actually ive got a little something prepared  if thats okay mac did you prepare  oh no sorry i totally forgot hes a terrible public speaker  he gets really flustered and he clams up and his thirdgrade stutter comes back  its adorable oh is that your phone   yeah  gonna answer that   well i dont wanna be rude  well the ringers going off in the middle of a funeral  its gotta be pretty important right  excuse me   charlie what do you want  mac you gotta come to my apartment right now  i cant dude im in the middle of something  i dont care what youre doing get over here right now its an emergency  fine   i gotta go its an emergency  you gotta leave thats a shame   so can i borrow your car or what  youve been drinking  uh  hes a good guy hes just got a bit of a drinking problem   who is it  its mac dude this better be good  holy shit  mmm   this is unbelievable  i know that there are like so many medals in there dude  this guy was probably like king nazi   how is this even possible charlie  oh its possible   they came on boats or whatever but theyre here  okay hold on   this could just be collectors crap  no no no no no  look at that   he looks exactly like dennis  i know  all right so heres the deal  he wants me to take all this shit to him so he can be like buried in it or something  buried in it screw that old bitch hes a nazi  let him die and burn in hell right lets sell this shit on ebay  no i thought about that though i think its like  illegal or maybe a little bit immoral   we could sell it to a museum  i could live with that  lionel keane  as we all know lionel could be a bit of a curmudgeon  but he had the heart of a lion  ill tell you a story about him  it was christmas eve last year and uh  i was at lionels house making him dinner  and we got to talking about the spirit of giving  and i said lionel why are we just talking about it  lets put the spirit into action lets go down to the mission  lionel said great thats a great idea dennis  so we did we went down there  and not only did we feed  every last poor miserable precious soul  but we washed the feet of every man woman and child there  in the spirit of christ  and that was lionel  lionel keane  lionel the lion   sorry to keep you gentlemen waiting  not a problem at all   how can i help you  we are going to make your day today sir   is that right  weve gotten our hands on a little something  that we like to think is an important part of human history  and needs to be in this museum  mac if you will  what in the hell is that  this my friend is an authentic nazi officers uniform circa 1942  notice the stitching and fine attention to detail  where did you get this  lets just say it found its way to us and leave it at that shall we  okay i find this offensive for so many reasons  im guessing you acquired this through illegal means  for me to take this from you would be an extension of that  and secondly that you would expect it would make my day  assumes that im interested in profiting off the murder of millions of innocent people  how much will you give us for it  nothing  nothing or  i plan to call the police the minute you guys leave my office   hey poppop  deandra  what are you doing here wheres dennis  oh um i just came by myself  oh well do you know where dennis is  he was supposed to be here hours ago  no no poppop its just me i thought that  you and i could spend some time together  so i brought a couple books that i could read to you  okay fine  come here and sit down  yeah  no why dont you come closer so i can get a good look at you   come here come here  okay thats fine   sure sure sure  good idea  come here a little closer come here  come on come on come here come here  oh now i remember how beautiful you are  and look at these wrinkled old hands against your young face  oh and and these teeth  look look how straight and white  is there a bathroom around here  yeah right down the hall  were doing the right thing here man  yeah but it just seems like a waste of a perfectly good nazi uniform  no no no if we sell it we run the risk of going to jail  and if we keep it we dont get anything so we may as well burn it   thats true  i mean it is always fun to burn things  yeah yeah it is  and we probably shouldnt let dennis know about his grandfather anyway   no  it might just screw with his head   yeah get it going  all right   get on  get on it   auf wiedersehen  auf wiedersehen my friend   whoo  whoo   so its all in there right  yeah   you didnt keep anything or  no did you   no no dude  okay   hey guys  hey
