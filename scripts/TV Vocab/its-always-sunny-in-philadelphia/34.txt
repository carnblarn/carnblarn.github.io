                how are we supposed to  scale back our energy costs when youre filling this generator with gasoline  yeah gross since when did you start running the bar on a gas generator   about a week ago ive been doing it for about a week  why would you do that  well because you know electricitys so expensive man  so i figured lets get a generator and you know run the bar on it  are you kidding me gasolines like a thousand times more expensive than electricity  and you know what charlie you shouldnt be making these decisions anyway okay   youre not the decisionmaking type  exactly  as the brains of this organization i shouldve made this decision   im sorry but when did you become the brains  im sorry ive always been the brains  what are your talking about i thought i was the brains what the hell am i   youre the looks  hey of course im the looks  but i was seeing myself as the brains and the looks  no youre the looks im the brains charlies the wild card  oh thats awesome  yeah yeah thats the classic setup you know this no  look every great crew in history has followed that basic dynamic right  looks brains wild card think about it  the ateam did it  scooby doo did it   the ghost busters did it  oh shit   yes right  yeah  our problem is that we dont stick to that basic format  and it gets us into trouble  so what youre saying is that by breaking from that format  were actually limiting our ability to be as successful as those organizations   totally right dude  great on to the matter at hand  were getting plowed in the ass by the oil companies and the gas  companies with their tengallon hats and their rotten assplowing hearts  so as the brains of this organization   i came up with a plan  lay it on us bud  it involves pulling up our bootstraps oiling up a couple  of asses and doing a little plowing of our own  pow   not gay sex  okay  okay cause thats what it sounded like what did you mean   were going to solve the gas crisis  oh good  its always sunny in philadelphia 402 the gang solves the gas crisis   charlie the plan is simple okay   is it  yes  we go to a bank we talk to a loan officer  we get a hefty loan to buy a bunch of gasoline  we take that gasoline we store it in the basement we wait a few months  when the gas prices skyrocket we sell it make a huge profit  yeah man if the guy doesnt seem like hes going for it  ill show him this uh bigbreasted women chart   and thatll win him over  yeah im sure it will  i mean cause thats great and the plans actually pretty great  the problem im having with it is that i dont have anything to do  no you do have something to do youre the wild card  you sit there looking crazy and capable of anything  yeah  yeah you set the tone for the whole meeting  so if im like there while you guys are talking and im just like like  thats terrible  that was my that was my wild card face all right  what message are you trying to send with that  really was that not a good one well so what if its more like like  and you want him to think that youre going to take a dump or   seriously thats what that looks like  i just dont know what   message youre trying to  oh man youre forcing it   oh my god you know what  yeah youre really forcing it  id better look in a mirror cause i dont know what im  doing and what it looks like feel like two different things  the brains im going to supervise cause there is   no way he should be making this decision  well walk me through it dude   cause i just dont see what youre talking about  its not a rape van its a spy van  it looks very much like a rape van to me but whatever   dennis you gotta look at this  what is this  bruce mathis is about to give away all of moms money  what are you talking about  in two days some muslim cultural center is about to get  a giant check made out of our cash and weve got to get that back  listen this jamoke is giving our money to terrorists  and weve got to prove it  dee mom gave all of our money to bruce  you were never going to get it anyway  oh nonono i was see i had a plan  i was going to eliminate everybody else and be the only surviving heir so help  so when you say eliminate you mean
