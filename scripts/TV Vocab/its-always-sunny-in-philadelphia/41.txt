                what were you even doing in that crawl space charlie  well for starters i was minding my own business  i was also trying to do a little light reading  and then i was putting some cheese in the rat traps  you were putting the cheese in the rat traps   can i smell your mouth  why  you were eating the cheese werent yououtof the rat traps  no well yes i mean i was eating the old cheese  to test it see why the rats werent eating it  why are you always doing such weird things charlie  i do weird things name another thing that you think is weird  i caught you stealing a bunch of coins out of the fountain at logan circle  i was acquiring a little bit of cash to pay my spy dee   why do you have a spy  to spy the waitress   of course i have a spy  is that normal to you  shut up and give me my book back please  hey guys what book you keep going on and on about  its nothing you dont need to see it  my god whoa  these are my these are my memoirs charlie you found my book  i wrote a memoirs hey guys charlie found my memoirs  your memoirs  ive been keeping track of all my sexual exploits  and i was going to unleash them on the world in a fiery blaze of eroticism  slow down a second dennis   you wrote a book  its more of a tale of redemption   told through my erotic travels  giddyup man thats amazing  thats good stuff right yeah  but then one day the book just sort of went mysteriously missing  charlie what the hell were you doing with it  well since he cant read im guessing he was masturbating to your pictures   goddamn jacking off to my  no no  thats not at all you know what are you doing to me  why are you doing this youve been riding me  now youre accusing me of things you just dont get it  you dont know why i do the things that i do  its nuts you dont know how hard i got it dee  youve got it pretty tough your life is pretty hard  how would you like to walk a mile in my shoes huh  try your old buddy charlie on for size  you want me to walk a mile in your shoes  cause i cant handle your big tough life i will  that sounds fine to me i will do that  oh my god shut up  dennis whats the name of this book  dennis reynolds an erotic life  guest  sososeries  i removed my robe and stood before her  taut nubile proud  she was much much older than me but her breasts  were awesome  i felt reborn baptized in erotic majesty   yeah  this is some sweet smut   im all boned up over here  me too  dennis we should try and sell this book  personal memoirs are huge right now  yeah yeah no im going to sell the book okay  but im not going to let you guys be involved  because every time youre involved you get all excited about something  and then you give up the minute we hit the first speed bump  you need us dennis youre going to need some legal help  legal help what the hell you talking about man  bro half the stories you just read us are total bullshit  theyre not bullshit what are you saying  dennis you were never the personal sexual adviser to jon bon jovi  and you never woke up in a rehab facility with the wounds of christ  miraculously appearing on your hands and feet  yeah man but i did i banged that girl in the fountain  that story was true the hot dog the oatmeal everything  dude you dont want to end up like that million little pieces guy okay  oprah made him look like a total dick  that guy was a turd i mean come on  just take some of those stories out  you cant take those stories out thats the rub  thats why he needs us  because the public loves those crazy celebrity stories and rehab shit  okay well so what are you thinking  im thinking we take some of the really good stories  you know the jon bon jovi the christ wound stigmatas  and we recreate them  we make them true so that people cant prove that they didnt happen  my god recreate some of the better stories in here   and then we have proof  yes  holy shit man thats a good idea  now first things first we got to figure out how to get you into rehab  charlie do i really have to sleep here  dee if youre going to walk a mile in my shoes  this is a pretty big part of that mile dont you think   here put these on  no  i dont want to wear one of your dirty sleeping outfits  im sorry dee but my outfits as you like to call them  serve a very specific purpose all right  this isnt just for fun  i dont have any heating ducts in this apartment  it gets freezing in here at night all right  now in case you have to peepee i got this for you all right   oh my god  goddamn it  frank was supposed to empty that  totally no wonder it reeks in here  you have open cans of pee everywhere  well im sorry but you do not want to use that bathroom  now eat one of these all right  youre going to want to huff a little glue and drink some beer   this is cat food charlie  dee i can explain it all right  theres some sort of weird chemical reaction that happens  when you combine cat food beer and glue  it makes you feel like extremely sick and tired   youre able to fall asleep  why would i want to make myself  extremely sick and tired  cause theres going to be about 50 cats howling outside  that window all night long and you have no idea how loud 50 cats can be  okay maybe there wouldnt be cats surrounding your building  if you didnt have open cans of cat food everywhere  i have 50 cats howling outside my window  because i have 10000 rats running around my building dee okay   stop yelling  im not an idiot  theres a reason to do the things that i oh  its starting right on time  if i were you id start wolfing that shit down  i got to go to sleep  oh im not feeling good at all  come play with us forever  and forever and forever  occupado  wake up lets go time to start the day   time to get up  charlie oh god  oh god theres evil twins in the  in the hallway and a twitching junkie in  what how much of that glue did you huff  i dont know as much as you did  as much as me really  well thats probably way too much glue for you dee  hey check it out you just had yourself a glue od  and those are pretty regular in my life  so you learned another lesson dont do too much glue or your night sucks  hold on a second youre saying that your life is so terrible  because you eat rat cheese and cat food and huff glue all day long  uh yeah  those arent real problems charlie  what do you mean theyre not real problems  you make those problems up you choose to do that stuff   those are solutions to problems  oh my god  you know what hold on a second  were going to turn the tables here  youre going to walk a mile in myshoes now  and youre going to see what its like to live in the real world  and have actual problems  okay you got some glue on your face dee you might want to wash it off  damn it  okay plan is simple  youre gonna hang out at the rehab facility for a couple a days  while we get the ball rolling with bon jovi  uh yeah i gotta say im a little skeptical  about you guys being able to get in touch with jon bon jovi  what what do you mean hes from new jersey   piece of cake  have a little faith in us please  plus its easy we just get you into a room with him  snap a couple of photos we got proof bingbangboom were done  now lets talks stigmatas  right do we have to do the stigmatas  dennis you know that this publisher is gonna have a fact checker right   yeah  you dont want to end up like  the million little pieces guy do you  i brought a nail gun  is that what that is look youre not gonna shoot nails in me  no i think a couple of severe burns  from the cigar is whats gonna do the trick  no no no you need deep wounds   thisll give you deep wounds  hold on a second no   nobodys gonna burn me  dennis calm down calm down  you focus on your art okay  frank and i will handle the business end of things  if you guys really want to do the stigmata thing  okay good work frank  now i think we should just probably leave the body right here right  and then in the morning theyll come out and find him  all right give me his hands  so i dont go to a therapist i just go to bars  if you walk up to the nearest drunk guy and bup him from behind  he always turns around and goes hey man  whats your problem  dee this guy is great  do you come here every night every night huh this is great  hey do the have food too cause i could go for some food  no no no food i dont eat when im here   well when do you eat  i dont  why dont you eat dinner dee you got to eat dinner sometime  because when you perform your nerves make you dry heave  and youd better hope that you dont have any food in your stomach   you gonna perform  all right  now this next lady you all know because shes here almost every night  lets hope shes got some new jokes this time  everybody put your hands together  for deandra reynolds  howdy
