really really young  mmhmm  what do you think these kids are in college or what  i dont know hey you how old are you  twentyone  everybody out  but i dont understand how you guys could let this happen  it was not my fault i was working behind the bar  come on dennis you remember what it was like in high school  the minute we caught word that a bar wasnt carding  we would just pack the place the following weekend  they probably had a recon crew come in last week   they definitely had  why you guys why were we not carding   not my job  not my job either  its all of our jobs we could get into a lot of trouble for this  and we also have a social responsibility to keep teenagers from drinking  i guess   i dont know about that though  oh mac   mac dont  hold on a second hear me out  it wasnt that long ago that we were in the same position as these youngsters right  i mean wed get kicked out of some bar and what did we do den  we would get a bunch of 40s from a homeless guy  and wed go sit in some park right   that is true that is absolutely true  and what would happen  we would almost get raped andor murdered andor stabbed by crackheads in fairmount park  you wanna know what else what would happen  we drove nicky potniks car into a tree on kelly drive  with sweet dee in the backseat puking because some guy talked to her that she liked remember  every time some guy talks to you that you like  you get so nervous you drink yourself into oblivion   i had bad potato salad  you drink yourself crazy  you abused alcohol and thats okay  but its very dangerous right right okay  well maybe we should look at this whole thing from a different angle  maybe we have a social responsibility to provide a safe haven  for these kids to be kids   you know experiment  no i dont like where this is heading   we would have to set up ground rules  okay  no drinking and driving no ones gonna crash nicky potniks car   right  everyone has to take a cab  four drink maximum like thats it you know what i mean  yeah yeah thats it anyone causing trouble cant come   if youre gonna be here you gotta be cool  hes gone hes gone  listen we water down the drinks jack up the prices   oh my come on  we could make a serious profit off these kids  and theyd have no idea what the hells going on   we would actually be doing something good  great i say we do it   yeah  i dont know how you guys live with yourselves   one day at a time  one day at a time  yeah i know mom i heard you the first time  im perfectly aware of what time it is thank you mom  do we have to do this right now  yeah i know how old
