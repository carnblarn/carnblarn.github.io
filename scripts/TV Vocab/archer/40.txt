                now tell me exactly  what happened  you through some shady deal with the border patrol  sent us to south texas to capture an individual named moreno   mexicos most notorious coyote  which is espaol for  peoplesmuggler  thanks thats  and also for coyote turns out  archer  its a loanword  or is it a calque  why do you always do this  because im always bored  is he  this is totally nerve wracking  how are you bored   dont engage him  because ive been lying in scorpion piss for two hours  in the sunblasted shithole which is texas waiting for a  stupid truck stuffed with smallish brown people who just want a job  and probably mexican cartel gunmen  whatd i just say  big whoop im spooning a barrett fiftycal  i could kill a building  just put one through the engine block when the truck has to stop  please  this is what he does  he knows were tense because were normal human beings  my theory and im serious is that hes got some rare kind of  pervasive developmental disorder or even undiagnosed atypical autism  your uh mics hot  i know  wow   well here comes the truck  okay were in position  great so after we catch him you can intentionally hurt his feelings  okay first of all  can i hold the fake baby  will you man up   kimberly kevlar   here we go  archer you ready  hang on lana im stacking rocks in order of descending size  see right there thats  oye mueve el coche  hi yeah we broke down  and  bueno pues los traspaso  dont run over us we have a baby  oops  es un robo  vaya  archer  not talking to you  ay  i can do this all day  since i find repetitive behavior so calming  jesus christ im sorry  ow  apologize to my tinnitus  now hands up moreno  its over   whatre you  thats not moreno  i am moreno  moreno is a woman  no shit   i dont understand  if moreno had surrendered how did it go so wrong  uh well kinda slowly at first i said slowly  whoa hey ladies cmon  i know the adrenalines still pumping but lets ya know  deescalate the situation  oh for  deescalate your dick  de  wait  escalate shutting up  hola soy sterling archer agente de  de isis no  wait how did you  lana mexico gets the news  i think do you guys uh las notcias  well heres some news now this is happening  i actually have some thoughts on that  no you actually  do and those thoughts  are how about we let seor ita  s  awesome seorita moreno go with a stern warning if she  promises never to do this again maybe over a drink  hola  oh shit i forgot theres people in there  cyril open the door idiot  dont push me  and do not  open that door  but  cmon they gotta be roasting  well im sorry but if we let em out then boom  they scatter  to where   uh our overburdened health care system  ooh  or maybe our taxfunded government schools for which   spoiler ahead  they dont pay taxes  how is a loraxblowing treehugger like you antiimmigration   because illegal immigration exactly i mean its  not like your ancestors ya know had papers  wow  cyril i said open the door  and i said dont push me  and then very very suddenly  because i couldnt hear you  over the sound  of now im punching you  dammit archer let him  oops  lana  have you lost your mind   no just my temper  now open the goddamn door  and seorita moreno youre free to go  although the appropriate thing would be to buy me a thankyou drink  uh  whatre you doing  what are you doing   you almost killed lana   nnghh  no see shes fine  shes not fine shes at least got a concussion  so  you get like six freebies  no you dont  yes you do cyril now put it down  you put it down  its over  we are turning moreno over to the border patrol and taking lana to a hospital  cant let you do that  the first part hospitals probably a good idea  well then well just see what your mother has to say about it  do not call her i swear to god ill  wait hang on  are you wearing kevlar  yes because im not an idi  oh no  sorry i know that hurt  nnghhhh  there just like the defiant ones  now then i believe there was some mention of a thankyou drink  so just so im clear you expect me to believe  that sterling beat both of you up then shot cyril   uh  uh  for some  haggard mexican   i wouldnt really describe her as haggard  i would  of course you would  but shut up tempers were kinda high about the illegals in the truck  oh who cares about them  not lana  still though it doesnt do you mind   yes its the most stupidest boring job in the whole stupid  boring world  but you insist that we do it  not right this second  remind me pam when did ms archer say she  wanted us to shred this crap  you did say right this second  i said it on tuesday  well   well what   i actually dont have a followup  but speaking of i bet a mexican would do this for a buck an hour  those documents are topsecret  you let pam do it  dicknuts  im just sayin they work hard as hell and they work cheap  cheap because they dont pay taxes  thank you  and when did you work with mexicans  where do you think milk comes from  hows it

sterling drove off in the truck  with this mexican woman  uh no  because if you will recall archer shot out the engine block  and i dont think she was the only one he drove off with  so where did they all go  and how  who the hell knows where   although we do have a working theory on how  hey im serious if i have to pull this car over you will regret it  so share the goddamn doritos  yeah lookin

big risk to help some poor people who just want a better life  for their family  and that to me is muy admirable  see  i knew you wanted to blow m  sorry that was inappropriate  although so was the response  drop the weapon  drop it  here  you are crazy  theyll kill us  uhuh empty  wh  last warning  those are threefiftyseven ow ruger sixes  they each fired six  how did you count them   im just super good at that  oh my god maybe i am autistic  ok ya dirtyass beaner thats it  qu   im sorry i couldnt hear you over the sound of  espera tena algo para esto  but id like to take this opportunity to apologize for that racial slur  s  what about the racial profiling  whatever happened to probable cause  our probable cause is the border  which we protect from terrorists  look were just doin our job here  shittily twofortwelve at that distance  although two does seem like plenty  mijo no debes beber  really you learn that in med school   lo siento lupe tengo mucho dolor  but quit hogging the beads im sure marisol and paz wanna pray  and these people arent  i mean not to sound racist but   we all know who the terrorists are  los musulmanes  lupe  cmon youre in america now you just imply it  hey let us go  you got our first aid kit the radio outta the truck so you   can monitor the police band  and not to sound racist again  but how many mexicans does it take to hook up a car stereo   hey  well   well what   dont actually have a followup  but seriously chuy que the hell pasa  i dunno the police band is working but now the eighttrack is not  why  would we need the eighttrack    oh

actually gonna take that back im glad you took the  time to fix it  eighttrack was the way to go  what do you mean way to go  which you clearly said sarcastically  i mean  thanks to you now there might not be any reward money which i had  earmarked for  vital operations  you were gonna redo your office  picture it all sort of panasian mod and the carpet  just a sea of white  but now im stuck with catpuke green  because you couldnt control sterling  since when is babysitting archer my job my god thats exactly my job  which to belabor the point you failed  now hes run off with this old mexican woman to who knows where  ewww  put a shirt on what is wrong with you   archer  is what is wrong with me  and not that i care at all but have you tried calling him  please with those idiot voicemails  ugh   although it couldnt hurt  hang on i should get that  now   trust me if you knew my mother  please if you knew mine  but you should not be talking right now  and he really shouldnt be drinkin  really  you learn that in med school  that you obviously didnt get into   im sorry veterinarian im in a lot of pain  i dont even know how youre alive  im very strong  and also very drunk  which paging doctor dt  mcshakyhands  seriously get your shit together  mother   listen im sorry i take  equal responsibility with lana  wh   but  ow  cmon katy hepburn  the stupid border patrol shot me twice and i could really  use a medivac chopper  im kinda near  hey where  goddammit man pace yourself  see  they just get more and more elaborate and then its ha ha  beep and then somehow im the idiot  what   no no no this isnt a voi smail  well im sure theres a lesson in there somewhere but  ow  hic  that oughta do er  gracias a dis  and to you doctor  you truly have the gift of healing  boy i wish youd tell that to the licensing board  you dont even have a vet license   thanks to one petty local politician  and one petty barn fulla dead horses  will you shut up and stitch me up   although if that wasnt a prank and the  border patrol did shoot him  inappropriate   oh he just has to ruin everything  yeah so watch   out for dehydration  thank you doctor we will  and also for internal bleeding  we  and sepsis  we  and mrsa  we  and probably not  a bad idea to get him tested for feline aids  we get it  now can we go already   he said in agony because the unlicensed vet drank all his tequila  es mejor no debes beber  lupe ya tengo una madre  now go  thank you doctor  oh dont thank me  seriously i probably did more harm than good so if theres  any way to get to one a medivac chopper wouldnt kill him  less he got flung up into the blades somehow   yeah thatd do it  that will do thank you  i  wait but two border patrol agents are missing  archers missing and you want us to do nothing  yes just like youve done up to now  malory we   but thank you both for  all that you did do  which again was nothing  nothing  i got shot  any idiot can get shot cyril  ask brett  now if youll excuse me i need to make some calls to see if i  can get my son out of this mess  hows it hangin grimace  owww  why  whys the ac on  thats not the ac its the heat  then whys it so cold   porque vas al cielo  really doubt im going to heaven  well dying  no hes not   well you say that  well never make it in  time in this crappy car  you need a helicopter  yeah i dunno if you heard but i dont have access to a helicopter  they do  cmon were in enough trouble already  with who   dammit  you call headquarters you say an innocent amer   republican was shot in a  gunfight with some illegals  wh  no thatll just make you people look worse  no not worse as in  okay screw you guys you know what i meant  but if they call this in youll  we will be far away by then  and besides what kind of car will the border patrol be looking for  a ridiculous lowrider truck with fenderflares and louvers and shit  exacto  and so mr archer im afraid for us this is adios  adios  not hasta pronto or   so im guessing thats a no possible on the blowjob  adios lindo  well if that aint a big loada shit turns out hes some kinda spook  dude phrasing  hes right here  dont listen to him youre beautiful  as is whatever youre doing with the morphinewise  keep that coming  that was my bosss bosss boss  he says yer ass gets total immunity  ha ha  for helping the most notorious coyote in todo
