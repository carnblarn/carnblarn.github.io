                wd40 mother  costs like a nickel  or maybe you could swallow your pride and just apologize to your super  oh and to me for ruining my friday night which is now being spent here  so what why the frantic phone call  hello  malory why did you call us  because if it was  oh  im gonna go out on a limb and assume it had something to do with that  its not what it looks like  oh well thats a relief  because it looks like youre sitting here with a gun  and over there strapped to a chair and shot to death  is a guy in a fullbody latex catsuit  or am i misreading the situation  well technically its a zentai  wh  a zentai covers the face and head   i think a catsuit just stops here  give me that  i didnt shoot him  so youre saying the fact that your gun has recently been fired is    is unrelated to the dead guy over there  whos chock full of bullets   well obviously theyre related  yeah do that  take that tone  but i swear i didnt shoot him  okay  so i guess he walked in here already shot obviously panicking  so you had to restrain him with these leather cuffs  and then to keep pressure on the wounds you greased him up   and squeezed him into this  zentai  and of course not you ass  someone broke in here and shot him  okay malory  well unless it was the creepyold peoplebondagesex police  why would anyone break in here and shoot him  no answer  okay lets ask him  holee shit  because hes savio mascalzone   um  oh for  the prime minister of italy  the what  and wait doesnt italy use a king  wh  no they dont use a king  what year do you think this is  i  yeah exactly good question   and uh speaking of questions  no no no dont   whatre you  dont go back there sterling i i have a question  mother  why does this chair have no seat  and what  is in his ass   mother  what is in this mans ass  oh please dont act like youve never seen a marital aid before  not in a dead prime ministers ass  and you dont have to keep repeating it  weve established where it is  yeah so you wanna move on to why  wait not why that  why hes here  savio and i met after the war when i was in italy with gladio  whos that his brother  no it  ewwwww  are you finished  hang on ew now im done  operation gladio  it was a nato staybehind mission set up to counter a possible soviet invasion  of western europe  but then it sort of turned into this whole weird cryptofascist cia  shitshow starring allen dulles and a bunch of former nazis  thanks holly hindsight  anyway savio was in italian intelligence rimshot   shut up and we were working all these late nights  there was a mutual attraction one thing led to another   please skip ahead  and then he got married  and went into politics  but ever since then once a year hed slip away and  wed spend a romantic weekend together  well you nailed it  i mean if this doesnt just scream romance   archer  what lana  whats more romantic than a dildopartyslashmurder  a murder im trying to get a handle on so could you shut up a second  and he wasnt always into that  you mean vice versa  shut up  as he grew older savios tastes became more and more exotic  and so he started introducing all these accoutrements very gradually  well hed have to  things huge  ow ow  okay okay i  okay god your hands are like cricket bats  shut up  so malory what happened can you walk us through the crime  just the crime of murder not the crime of sodomybyrubbereggplant  savio was in town to give a speech at the un  wed made plans to meet here so he gave his handlers the slip  and arrived here at about seven  we caught up over a glass or two of champagne  then i freshened up while savio got changed and situated   so he put the uh in his own  yes hush  i came out of the bedroom savio sei pronto  si cara mia molto pronto  i crossed over to the chair and tightened his last restraint  oho  mi fai pazzo con libido  then i went to refill my champagne savio loved to be kept waiting   and then bang  in burst three men  aaaaaghh oof  che cosa  cara mia che  savio  andiamo subito  wait whoa whoa back up why did you have a gun  hm oh well savio liked it to seem a little dangerous  you know  no mother i dont  jesus what else was on tonights menu  sex under a hive of africanized bees  archer   so you fired three times  and missed  can you believe it  no  oh sorry was that rhetorical  lawyer up call the cops  what  oh and hit the throttle on the bourbon because im gonna have to  im gonna have to bust you in the face a couple times  what are you talking about  selfdefense  its your only shot  we gotta uncuff him and dedildo him obviously  smash the furniture like he was chasing you around all rapey  fortunately hes italian so that shouldnt be too hard a sell then   i didnt shoot him  on purpose exactly the gun just went off  but you probably wanna play that a lot softer with a jury  a jury  when you dont believe me  mother come on i mean i want to believe you  but those bullet holes dont prove anyone else was ever here   well maybe those dont  puttana  ungh  what  you got  malory you got shot  yes i know dear i was there  well lemme see take off your coat  no im fine its just a throughandthrough  mother malory  what i put bactine on it  mother  sterling  the italian prime minister was just assassinated in my apartment  and so i think an apology is in order  thanks i know thats hard for you  wh  you two owe me an apology  for what  not believing me  how about for you dragging us into your sm  dildosexmurder freak show  i  look  you look  i bet ill never be able to have sex again without thinking about this  i bet i wont even be able to eat spaghetti and meatballs  oh my god  what what  i could eat  i mean not necessarily spaghetti and meatballs but  not necessarily not spaghetti and meatballs  i mean i really like spaghetti and meatballs  man if i dont get some spaghetti and meatballs i may literally die   oh and thanks so much  youre welcome  but you should waitll you try it im just kinda winging it here  i meant for dragging me into this  still welcome  so  weve got dead italian prime minister in the living room which   sucks i bet he knew how to make sauce  which will be hard to explain  especially given the circumstances leading up to his death which were   dildoey  unseemly   potato podildo  so plausible deniability  isnt a superrealistic goal here  so we need to sneak the body out somehow  sure well just walk a dead body right out the front door  idiot  what then  burn the apartment down  were not burning down my apartment  you sure  shut up i hit broil instead of bake  well blood loss can make you stupid  can i please look at your wound  no  nor can you burn down my apartment so think of something else  i shall fetch a rug  something else  youre not rolling him up in one of my rugs  why not  because then what  we get some coveralls and a van  like a carpet cleaning van and just walk him right out the front door  you just called me an idiot for that  your version didnt have coveralls  could we go out through the basement  no  wed have to go past the supers apartment and his door is always open  i assume to let the stink of cabbage waft through the halls but   so you think hed be a problem  god yes   were not on the best of terms  its just at christmas  the tenants usually gimme a small consideration for the work i do all yeer  keepin up the bildin  we surely count on it maam  specially this yeer as we had moren the usual medical bills  your point being  just that fer the tird year runnin ya gimme a potato  oh dear so once again youre faced with the classic  irishmans dilemma  do i eat the potato now or let it ferment so i can drink it later  will i get the operation now da  no son yer gonnaa die  what is your problem with the irish  you mean besides not being on our side in world war two  yeah besides that  wait seriously  they were nazis  no   not japanese  neutral  and now since i dont wanna be an accessory after the fact  hows about we figure out a way to get that body out of the damn apartment  whered we land on the coveralls thing  archer  because i dont even know where wed get coveralls  this time of night so  soooo if we cant get the body out of   here in one piece  nooope  what  lana its the only way  what is  no malory ive done some messed up shit working for you but i am not  repeat not chopping up a dead body  oh ewww mother  what my god do you want me to get the electric chair  for a murder you both know i didnt commit  malory i just cant  me neither  cant  or wont  i  whatever call it her cant me wont  no hey mother cmon  stop that  here here look  im gonna get help  from from whohoohoooo  i need access to a twoinch drain hot water three gfci outlets  this bathroom should do nicely and a pot of coffee just like i like my women  black bitter preferably fair trade  oh and your sauce needs less salt   how can you   put two halves of a potato in with the sauce  itll absorb the salt  oh and i assume thats our patient  not ours krieger  yours  thank you  ugh too salty  yeah you got a potato  what is this christmas  and is krieger hard at work  he literally might be yeah  ew  well say what you will about him i did  hes discreet  so no one else will ever know about this whole aaaaaaaaaghhhh  what in the hell is that  hopefully my greatest work yet  no no no no no  whatever this is i am not getting mixed up in it  too late  hey whoa whoa everybody calm down  its not what it looks like  well then what is it exactly  cause it sure as shit aint a surprise party krieger  ya big fat liar  someones trying to frame malory for murdering the prime  minister of italy  i bet its that wicked king  so  whyd krieger drag us into it  yes krieger  why  i needed help disseminating him  ewww  not what it means  but its still pretty gross though  and brilliant  when im done each one of us will walk out the front door   carrying a small parcel  how small  eh  then on our way home we simply drop the parcels into  seven different trash cans in three different boroughs  thats actually pretty smart  and hopefully when you look at all the  different drop points on a map itll look like a big smiley face  thats actually pretty gross  kind of clever  every time  every single time we come over here we have to help you get rid of  a dead body  well youve only been here twice  speaking of why the hell was the prime minister of italy here  dont ask  and follow up did those dastardly dagoes kill  him and then dress him up like a big giant penis or   oh god that reminds me  krieger  yeah i found it  found what  dont ask  can i keep it  keep what  dont ask  just get it out of here please   yeah take that tone  id like to know this  could possibly get any worse

walther pp chambered for thirtytwo acp  whats the magazine capacity  uhgh eight  eight rounds  plus one in the chamber  for a total of nine  hey thanks rainman  your point being  malorys clip was empty  but she said she only fired three shots  oh my god so youre saying mother lured mascalzone up there  greased him into a sixfoot manrubber strapped him to a chair  sei pronto  si cara mia sono molto pronto  bene anchio  oho  mi fai pazzo con libido  i know dear  but you have to wait  calls us what  mother calm  im on my way  dont move  ill probably be back  then she pulls a gun on him  che cosa  what is this  a crock of shit  because that would mean she called the cops on herself  knowing theyd never come back after they searched her apartment  which was full of people and spotless  oh my god do the math rainman  the wall was shot three times mascalzone was shot five times  for a total wait for it of eight  yeah  plus the one in her arm  wh  so what mother shot herself  oh my god  ungh  mio dio perche  why  ill tell you exactly why  before i kill you  operation gladio  gladio  which would mean mothers been banging him once a year for like  thirtyfive years and the whole time shes been holding a grudge  just waiting to holy shit  she killed him  and got us to dispose of the body  ugh but why  after all this time  well to be honest until recently the sex has been  pretty phenomenal  grazie  and i figured eh whats the hurry  but then you started getting weird  but why you make la vendetta  because one night all those years ago in rome  you and your fascist thugs gunned down a young man in the street  a beautiful man   blue eyes full lips black thick wavy hair  perche  what was his crime  well i wouldnt call speaking out against the rebirtof fascism  a crime  more of a mistake  by a beautiful idealistic young man  who may have beenee my sons father  may have been  you dont know  madon  che tipo di puttana sei  che tipo davvero  cazzo fascista  who knows its malory  you really wanna know why she killed a guy  i do not no  although i am curious why she wouldnt take off that trenchcoat  mm  honey you still got it  bow chicka bow bow  uh huh huh  so much of this i never wanna know the answer to  okay how bout a slice  god whats with me and italian lately
