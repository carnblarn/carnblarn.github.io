                hurry hurry sit down come in  i have the most fantastic news  what did bub finally die  whos bub  my mother and before you make some snotty comment  yes i have a mother do you want to hear my news or not  yeah if youre done yelling at me for no reason  last night an air force b52 bomber crashed off the coast of bermuda  well its about frickin time  what were we not bombing them in advance of an amphibious invasion  why would we invade  bermuda  ah bermuda i was thinking bahamas  same question  same answer why not its how we got the virgin islands  actually the united states bought the virgin islands from denmark   okay mr peabody  are you finished  yes  good because the b52 was   in the middle of the bermuda triangle is this  about the bermuda triangle because thats my fourth biggest fear  its about the b52s payload  namely a mark28  hydrogen bomb  ohhhh  which isis is going to recover  what  and then give to the us government in exchange for a huge reward  so ransom it back  no not ransom it cyril were look semantics whatever this is   treason  a huge opportunity for isis   or the russians the b52 is on the ocean floor here at a depth  of eight thousand feet  or thirteen hundred  thirtythree fathoms  how do you know that  how do you not  so recovering the bomb requires a deep submergence  vehicle the only american dsv is here in the pacific the russians have  one in the north atlantic so if they hear about the wreck and start   steaming toward it  they dont actually steam anymore mother  its a figure of speech like shut your hatch  because my point was the russians will beat them to it so we are going to  beat the russians  give it up folks  mike eruzione  lana well  shut up  since krieger doesnt have a   submersible hidden in his lab  or do i  i dont actually  then how are we supposed to beat anybody to a hydrogen bomb under  twopointtwoseven leagues of water  oh my jesus god damn alright already  can i possibly help you  please i know you were talking loud so  id hear you so whatever but were not speaking so if you  want a deep submergence whatever you can talk to my stupid gross brother cecil  who by the way is here to see you  ms archer will see you now  thank you cheryl i rrraaaghh  i hate you  hello im cecil tunt  i believe youre in need of some assistance  yeah rienpoortvliet just called he wants you to pose for him  cmon beloved illustrator of gnomes  jesus read a coffee table book   wow you own an island an undersea laboratory  and this choppersaurus  guess it doesnt suck to be a billionaire huh  probably not but cheryl and i split our  parents estate so technically im only worth five hundred million  which also doesnt suck obviously  unlike you who totally sucks obviously  will you shut up  i swear to god if you get us kicked off before i get my jumbo scrimps on   youll wish you were michael findlay  a cecil wont kick you off he wants  everybody here for no good reason he doesnt need one  hes an american hero whos going to make me rich  and b thats not even real shrimp  this is all vegansoybullshit  pffrrfft prrfft puh  because hes totally vegan because his  stupid gross girlfriend tiffys a vegan and a brotherstealer  who can also totally heeearyoooou  which is amazing because why arent you dead  from protein deficiency  uh because i get all eight essential amino acids  from amaranth and quinoa without murdering helpless animals  oooooh  kkkuughh  hey tiff  could you instead of antagonizing her maybe go ahead and take off  love yoooou  well rendezvous with my research vessel in a few hours so in the meantime  i guess continue to make such wildly liberal use of the bar  done youre okay cecil i dont get why cheryl hates you so much  right  i mean youve got this whole jacques cousteau   thing going on thats  just one of many philanthropies i have so  much on my plate as it were  children without plates speaking of plates uh doctors within borders  within borders  well of countries ravaged by war  right otherwise otherwise theres not really much point  then theres nourish a child shoe a child bespectacle a child   umm one laptop per child soldier  wait what  which

archer i   you know they wont  let you keep dating cyril  right plus no bacon  you done  well for now but after i take a nap youll wake up just in  time to get shot for treason because your mother wants to ransom a hydrogen  bomb back to the united states government  its a reward and maritime salvage law is very clear on the subject  according to cecil  and whats he getting out of this  i guess whatever useless thing philanthropists normally get from  squandering their money on the poor  so what hes conducting a huge naval operation just for a warm fuzzy  i  hey wait a second  what  i think i have room for a fuzzy navel  wow tiffy who taught you how to fly  was it that goose you freed ruining last years christmas  dinner or  rrrgh cecil i swear to goddess  i know tiffy but please try to
