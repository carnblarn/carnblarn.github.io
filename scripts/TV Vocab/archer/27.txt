                cmon cyril beat it get outta here  this meetings for field agents only  which brings me to item one  we dont have enough field agents to effectively run our covert operations  especially since this one went and got himself paralyzed  yeah thats me mr selfish  more like ms  anyway effective immediately im promoting cyril to field agent  what  do what  hey that sounds great best of luck  where do you think youre going  oh sorry i gotta get back to earth before the stargate closes  get back in here  mother the chevrons are locking  and cyril is utterly laughably unqualified to be a field agent  some offense  some taken  well none of you were qualified when you first started   and youve already given cyril some training  which ended with a dead  hooker in my trunk  no it didnt  it easily could have  malory you cant just  end of discussion  and since this meeting is for field agents only  youre taking me out of the field  well unless we need someone to go undercover as a shopping cart  this is roman calzado the notorious colombian drug lord  and hopefully an infusion of muchneeded capital  since when are we bounty hunters  since the deas budget was gutted by all those federal  spending cutbacks  which is ridiculous given the current economy  the most efficient way to decrease the budget deficit is   to increase tax revenue through um  cyril dont make me  regret this decision  sorry  and if you were in my tax bracket you wouldnt be  spouting that socialist propaganda  or wearing such shitty clothes  or doing such shitty missions  what are you talking about  the reward is a million dollars  exactly and how many drug users could be treated with that money  who cares  seriously  lana theyd just go buy a million dollars worth of crack with it  you dont give them the money  you cant theyll blow it on crack   oh my god  no they wont because itll in the isis bank  account  because youre going to get calzado dead or alive  and cyril dress appropriately youll be helicoptering into the jungle   coool  oh and this whole thing reminds me  pam nine am friday morning all isis employees will take a drug test  nkay  and knock off that damn beatboxing  ugh  last week it was freestyling   yes this lz  you dumbass  where we are right now  in twenty four hours  and you better be here  what a dick  well hes probably just under a lot of stress  since hes our only way out of th stupid jungle dumbass   seriously  thanks ghost of teddy roosevelt  ms archer said dress for the tropics  tropics or busch gardens  hey ya know what  yes  heckle  jeckle  between us and calzados fortified compound theres about  ten clicks of jungle that i just assume is one giant boobytrap showroom  so shut your dickholes get your gear shut up again and start walking  any questions  cyril  whats a click  yeah you say that all the time and i never know what  youre talking about  im assuming its a sound of some sort  nuhuhh  swear to god first thing friday morning we all gotta pee in a cup   which i cant even doyall cleaning out my freezer  last week found a big bag of skank  i guess i brought it back from jamaica but  but its  just a pot test right  no stupid  all drugs  oh shit  i call em grooving bears  how bout you ironsides  you rollin dirty  umm possibly  well then were all screwed  talking about the drug test huh  duh  well  what if i told you i had a way to beat any drug  test in the world  are you telling us that  yes  well  what is it  i call it kriegerkleanse  its an herbal tea allnatural and its guaranteed to rid your  body of all traces of any illicit substance  well here gimme gimme give it  ah ah ahh  i literal  figuratively scoured the globe for these special herbs  at no small expense to myself  ugh how much  hundred bucks each  or you can save your money and try your luck in the  current job market  nonsequential bills please  well then why not just say kilometer  because shut up   jungle ziiing  so it says here that   calzado isnt even the head of the whole operation  cyril  hes actually just a distributor for somebody named la sombra  the shade  cyril  no i bet in this context the shadow  cyril  oof  hey whats your problem  my problem is i dont want a thousand of steel balls  to shred my genitals  huh  claymore mine  full of steel balls that fly a thousand meters  or one click   a second right at dick level   jeezy petes  or ass level which in your case would also  take off your head  so quit reading and pay attention  but theres a lot of useful stuff in here organizational charts  inventory and cashflow analyses spreadsheets  of what possible outcomes with a twentysided die  well you dont need a spreadsheet for that  yeah and you dont need one to know youre gonna suck at  being a field agent cyril  so why do you wanna be one  i dunno i just wanna feel like im a part of the team ya know  i guess i wanna feel like i matter more  wow not afraid to dump out your purse in the jungle huh  okay cyril then lesson onea  in a potentially hostile environment like this the key is total situational  awareness   okay  you look you listen you smell  and you remember to check your six  my six what  is that my gun  the old six shooter  oh my god a clock cyril it means behind you  because the last thing you want is  uh lana hold up a sec  archer we dont have a  cyril  yeah thats why i said hold up  archer  dont yell at me i looked away for literally literally one second  well where the hell did he go   i dunno its like he just  youre looking for  predator arent you  yes  couple things  a hes invisible  not totally he has a telltale shimmer  ow  and b lower your frickin voice  oye  manos arriba  is that cyril  quien es  no its not whimpery enough  cyril cyril  god damn it  well look on the bright side  which is  which is what  whats the bright side  oh  thats a figure of speech  all im saying is there are a million green rectangularly reasons to  complete the mission and zero reasons not to  you mean besides cyril getting captured  yeah besides that  and if calzados men got cyril well rescue him when we get calzado   problemo solvedo  what if it was fark  or veln  then well use some of the million dollar reward to pay his ransom  so shut up cyrils going to be fine  unless a tiger ate him  tigers dont live in south america  well at least one does because i just heard its spinetingling roar  that was a jaguar dumbass  thanks marlon perkins  i think i know a tiger when i hear one  every time your big fat mouth gets us caught every time  not every time like a third of the time  and a thousand bucks thats a tiger lana  if this doesnt work we just paid a hundred  bucks for liquid fart  yeah well heres shit in your eye  oh god it tastes worse than it smells  man if i had a nickel for every time i heard a guy said that  id have eight nickels  archer i swear to god if you dont shut up  im just saying if it comes down to that and i hope it doesnt  theres no sense in us both getting raped  fernando our special guests must not be injured in any way  uh does that include rape related injuries  of course  no one is going to rape you  what is wrong with you  were scared  were just tourists see and our car broke down  so the assault weapons and plastic explosives why do you have these  yes let me explain  busted were arms dealers  no i think not  i think you are hunting roman calzado  in the hopes of a million dollar reward  ok yes busted again  but i think now were kinda rethinking that  so if i give you two million will you go away  and say you never found me  i  oh my god totally yes  then we give mother a million and you and i can  split the other million  calzado youve got yourself a deal  excellent  but of course i was joking  obviously i can not allow you to live  no yes you can  or choose not to whatever besides throwing money away like that  would not please el contador  el contador doesnt that mean  the accountant si  cyril  que  no he said cereal  que  cerealas  el quiere desayuno  and people in hell want ice water  oye  pardon  oh my god  im gonna die in a toilet stall just like the gypsy said  damn that krieger  naziclonebastard  well we dont know it was the tea  aagh  who the hell are you  im your friend pam im  pam   youre not my friend youre a decepticon  waaaagh  how are you both still alive  the floor is lava  the floor is lava  clinical trial thirteen  subjects responses are exceeding expectations  pam youre melting  youre melting  because the floor is lahvuhhuhhhh  must kill decepticon  call terry  rrowwr  the tiger says rrowwr  the tiger also says you owe me a thousand dollars so   no i dont  because i didnt bet   the welsher says  psssst  no thats a snake  oh boy am i glad to see you guys  cyril what the hells going on  are you a drug dealer now or  what no  and you guys arent gonna believe what happened  i had um gastric distress or whatever so i was just gonna duck off the   trail  and you remember to check your six  my six what   before i knew what was happening  oh man right in my new pants  oye   hellooo   manos arriba  quien es  and i only had a second to answer so i thought what would lana do  not archer  no i had to outsmart them  he said suddenly too big for his shitcaked britches  archer  and then it came to me  uh quien soy  soy el contador  enviado de la sombra  donde esta calzado  whats a la sombra  calzados boss dont you remember the dossier  no  yes  but what about the gunshot  then they brought me here and i bluffed my way through the rest  la sombra did not say you were coming  well i assume he did not want to give you the time to cook your books  i  that  i swear i dont do that  well then you are a fool  que  you pay la sombra sixtyfour cents on every dollar you make no   mmmmas o menos pero  i can get that down to thirty cents  and he will never even know  si pero como  you just leave that to me amigo  wait whats in this for you  we split the difference of course  but first i need some clean clothes  this is not mud all over my pants  its caca  holy shit cyril  literally  yeah really kinda wish id skipped the diarrhea part  forget that you did great  really  it figuratively kills me to say this cyril but yeah you did  so now what whats the plan  oh well i was hoping you guys could come up with something  and ideally before tomorrow at dawn  why whats  what is going on here  ah amigo  i was just mocking this giant negress and her sissy sidekick  yes they are ridiculous no  are the accommodations to your liking  honestly  no  you shouldnt even keep animals in these conditions  look at them  cement floors steel bars no room to run around nothing to play with  ah i think perhaps you are confusing this with a zoo  i think maybe its all these exotic animals  yes exotic animals for me to hunt  you hunt them  how can you do that  like this  god damn dude  but you see  even the majestic bengal tiger is too easy to kill  its boring  which is why tomorrow at dawn i will be hunting the most  dangerous game in the world  jai alai  us  what  si  so sleep well amigos  i want you rested and strong for tomorrow  venga senor contador cenamos juntos  so yeah try to think of a plan  well go ahead and say it  say what  how since were gonna die in the morning we should have sex now  after seeing a tiger get murdered lana  no offense but im not really in the mood  if you want i can watch while you masturbate  but i can tell you right now my hes not gonna be in it  it will be with that tigers family  but go ahead start  and so begins the hunt for the most dangerous game   hooray  so what are the les here exactly  lana be still  you get a thirtyminute head start  then el contador and i just us alone will track you and kill you  uh uh oh  can they split up  ehhh sure why not  then i propose a friendly wager  we each hunt one of them and the first to kill his quarry is the winner  i like this idea  but which  i get the woman called it boom  i  alright since you called it  oye cochino okay lets hunt some humans  go go go go gunngh  are you really that selfish  apparently  clinical trial thirteen update  as hypothesized after mindshredding hallucinations  subjects b and c have lapsed into deep unconsciousness subject a however  remains at large   begin clinical trial fourteen  lana lana  where the heck is  shmmpf  dont scream its me   oh thank god i thought those were yeti hands  never gets old  but good idea back there getting everybody to split up  thanks yeah i figured youd know to head back to the uh lz thingy   which weve only got about an hour to get to so    and i figured once i found you we could work together  to rescue archer capture calzado and escape  ya know you dont actually suck at this  really  youre thinking tactically making quick decisions and i gotta tell  ya confidence is pretty damn sexy   reeally  theoretically  sorry  okay youre doing pretty well so far so whats the plan rookie  and sooner would be better than later  yeah calzados on a darn threewheeler  can you believe that guy  who the druglord who hunts humans for sport  i know but thats just lame  cyril  uh uh okay so we have to assume archers heading back to the lz too   but he cant possibly outrun calzado  yeah neither can we so  we dont need to outrun him  just archer  what  come on  oww  oh eat a dick jungle  cover it with malaria and leeches sprinkle some dengue fever on it  and eat a big goddamn jungly dick  yeah you do that and ill just wait here for a bask of orinoco crocodiles to  wander by and eat me  oh great thats probably them now tearing around on speciallyequipped  crocchoppers  wait what the  goddess of the jungle i take it all back  for when i was thirsty you saw fit to slake my thiiiiiirrrrst  goddess of the jungle you are a whore  oh thank god i thought you were crocodiles  crocodiles  on a threewheeler  right  how scary would that be  mmm probably not as scary as knowing that i am going to cut you down  from there and then gut you like a fish  well then youre obviously an idiot when it comes to crocodiles  aka the worlds most deadliest predators  i am the worlds deadliest predator  or are you  que  cyril  no breakfast for you  no thats my name calzado  cyril figgis isis agent  bastardo mentiroso  isis  thats right  and youre under arrest  albeit extrajudicially  over my dead body  well that can be arranged  lana   hellooo ay caramba wh wait a minute  was i just bait  thats right archer  all part of my brilliant plan  lana get some vines and tie him up chopchop  chopchop   here we go  uh yeah it means hurry  cmon we got a chopper to catch tie him up  you do it  okay i see what youre doing here  hands behind your back calzado  make me  i  look she will shoot you  no i wont  no she wont  cmon cyril go all rogue on him  guys cmon this is ridicul  ungh  i think im gonna be  ungh   yeah im gonna be sick  here maybe thisll help  aaagh my eyes  probably shouldnt have done that  not enough left to get drunk on  bastardo  i kill you  lanaaaa  what the hell damn guy   oh thank you thank you thank you  youre welcome cyril  so did you learn any valuable lessons today  yes i did  me too  i learned i dont like being bait  owww  sorry cyril did that hurt  cyril cyril  cyriiillll  yes it frickin hurt  yeah right  what  yes obviously i heard what you said  i just cant believe the head of the dea has the balls to say it  oh is that a fact  oh it is  mhm yep  so uh howd that go  oh fine  he was just explaining to me why isis wont be receiving any  reward for capturing calzado  because apparently theres no proof that we did  we literally handed calzado to them  and in return did they hand you a signed receipt for the prisoner  no they  oh  oh shit  mm so well done  because thats exactly the brand of unparalleled professional excellence that  ive come to expect at isis  no no no no nooo  what the  oh i wish i was still blind  youll never take me aliiiive  what was i saying   oh yes unparalleled  paaaam  for the love of god seal the exits   professional  thats our pee  and thats the last i better hear about it  because this stupid building is a tinderbox and i will burn it to the ground  excellence  oh hey speaking of excellent did you hear we met a tiger  but he got murdered
