youre flying in style and safety  safety  but isnt hydrogen flammable  and how timmy  thats why excelsior is filled with safe natural helium  why its actually flameretardant  neat and safe  so whether youre enjoying excelsiors majestic vistas  dutyfree shopping highstakes baccarat  dancing with your lovely wife  or even a cigar after a french gourmet dinner  youll be enjoying them in style and safety  all aboard excelsior  who would want to put a bomb on that  well thats what were hoping isis can find out  archer no why bother  some broad gets on there with a staticky sweater and boom  its oh the humanity  no no thats   malory sterling  were you watching some other blimp commercial just now  technically its a rigid airship  malory filled with helium  lana which is nonflammable dumbass  i thought our promotional video covered that fairly well  malory oh and how sterling its totally safe  well except for the bomb threat  malory no not to worry dear  isis wont let terrorists blow up your lovely blimp   rigid airship   my top two agents will be on board   nope   and i will oversee the operation personally from  what i assume will be firstclass accommodations  ooh actually we are fully booked  well if you think  oh i dont know   this trudy beekman person can thwart a major terror plot   i suppose we could bump mrs beekman  bump me im not going if these two can share a cabin   nope  not going to let the terrorists win   well pose as husband and wife  nope  cyril would totally freak  malory come on let me stay with you  and well do the whole oprahgayle thing  malory nope i need a stateroom to myself  in case i have a gentleman caller  archer mother please lana please  do not make me do this  malory but lana think of the nocent lives youll be saving  and also the fact that this is a direct order  lana at least tell me its separate beds  lana lana lana lanaaa  lana what  danger zone  terrible awful just gutwrenchingly bad feeling about this  baby i really need you to trust me okay  now is the cabin small yes  and yet surprising amount of storage  ugh and i will hardly be in here okay  because ive got a terrorist to find  and i doubt hes hiding under  whats basically a twin bed  archer  since its all drawers under here because look how tiny this room is  oh my god its like a broom closet  and yet a surprising amount of storage  oh shut up  and cyril very eager to know why youre still here  he was just  helping lana get settled  trust me cyril she already settled  disembark cyril  were about to launch or whatever blimps do  yeah what does a blimp do pam  uh kick your skinny ass  now come on we got to get off this thing before   relaaaxgod weve got half an hour  oh well then make me a double campari and uh  i guess vodka  we dont normally drink on the bridge  well i dont normally fly on the hindenburg 20  and cyril doesnt normally storm off without even kissing me goodbye   so were all out of our comfort zone  not me  my stateroom is gorgeous  malory that  whats her name  beekman  i bet shes just sick she got bumped  yes she literally vomited from anger  so if we could just focus on the bomb threat  lana how about crew members  anyone who might be disgruntled  achtung  thats lieutenant krauss  he and i were both up for command of the excelsior but   you got it  leaving him with motive  release the mooring cable  come on its not larry luftwaffe  thats   oopsie  ugh way too obvious  god damn it  were moving  i know  what happened to half an hour  i lied  wh why the   why the hell are you two still here  because i knew youd be here with mr archer  no no now that is   so ironic cyril especially in light of recent  no rugburny events oh my god  you two banged  i uh   see heres the thing etfruibasket  you are just a dog in a manger  i dont know what that means pam  i didnt grow up on a cheese farm  oh for the  its called a dairy  and even the slightest hint of a problem on our maiden  voyage would kill excelsiors stock price  so lana canvass the passengers and crew  learn what you can about krauss  but please be discreet  lana hey good advice  which maybe ill just sort of  fold in with my 12 years of experience as a covert operative  malory dont be snotty  malory and sterling if there is a bomb captain dear  where would it do the most damage probably   archer uh this new place called anywhere  this whole things a bomb its not   archer jesus  want to blow us all to shit sherlock  malory sterling archer what  for the last time the excelsior is filled with nonflammable helium  although this is a nonsmoking area sir  damn it hes a prospective investor  not after that i bet  forget about krauss  theres your bomber  who  what  that guy  beardsley mcturbinhead  you idiot  thats sandu singh the billionaire investor  hes a sikh  oh so if hes not a muslim he just gets a pass  well thats called profiling  mother and i dont do it  mr singh is excelsiors majority shareholderso  if anything went wrong on this flight hed lose millions  its a perfect cover sterling  lana just go look for the stupid bomb  relax what do we have like four hours before we get to london  lana four hours malory are you joking  the crossing takes 24 hours  archer are you joking  what rigid airships combine the pampering of a cruise ship  with the speed of  some other slightly faster ship  uh hello airplanes  yeah its blimps you win bye  oh god  i hope you didnt invest in this  itll be fine though blimps are terrible  as long as nothing goes wrong on this flight  oh captain my captain with isis on board  what could possibly go wrong  pick one  either a i tell lana what  happened on that scratchy green  office rug or two you get inside me  or c maybe i just  jam this mop into the engine and kill all of us  i dont think thats how blimps work  darn right we just sort of float around  stupid naturally safe helium  but i am liking the jamming imagery  and the killing  and are you just gonna sit there  yeah until she tags me in  what im kidding  my backs all messed up  so youre ruining cyrils life because  in your dreamtheimpossibledream world  itll make mr archer jealous  oh pamela  yeah  whats the poem gonna be about when cyril snaps and murders you  i dont know  worlds gushiest orgasm  can you just get out of the way  what are you gonna shoot me again  yes  oh  well then hang on  cyril is already freaked out enough about us sharing  this shoebox without you airdrying your unkempt bush  unkempt bush  um youre one to talk  my vulva is smoother than a veal cutlet  what terrible timing oh really  baby

off your vealy vulva  cyril  you know your whole trust thing  and ive tried to okay  you know what  we are on a break oh yeah  yeah  well thats fine by me  cyril wait  no running shut up   oh my god

slurps out the stress  cant wait to tell trudy beekman  all about it uh if we ever meet  what about you anything on krauss  no shut up  have you seen cyril  why would i have  and what the hell is he doing  archer hey what did i tell you huh  archer huh there  go buy a nicotine patch  gentlemen  no no no what happened to discretion  lana what happened to that bartender  malory right  guy sees an empty glass and all of a sudden hes judge crater  oh for gods sake nigel some chips for mr   archer archer sterling archer  the minimum bet is 10000 sir  dollars  archer oh i stuffed all my money in that guys mouth  well perhaps we could play for something much more interesting  archer yeah cause that was seriously  like all the cash i had on me so  so if i win i spend a night of passion with your exquisite wife  archer my what  oh yes my wife of course  yeah its a deal  but if i win you tell me where the bomb   baccarat archer what  mr singh wins  archer wait wait wait we were going  the von zeppelin suite  i shall expect her within the hour  archer shes not gonna be happy about that  um what are you mostly paid in tips  almost entirely sir  well whose fault is that  i  you   malory prancing around in your fiacci knockoffs  blathering about your vulva  lana hey first of all   malory im just saying  youre driving cyril straight toward another woman  lana cyril with another woman

suite  theres a von zeppelin suite  which im sure is what i meant so go  thanks archer  youre the best i know  so yes the bottom  line is that i was unfaithful to you two  well three times i guess if a dryhumpy choker counts  and if you cant see it in your heart to forgive me  i will forgive you  because thats what love is lana  its forgivey  which is not a word  come on figgis  all right here we

her to go confess to lana  but so then this one starts  freaking out and long story  short i kind of had to drown her in the tub  so you killed her  apparently not so  good news  shut up pam  and did cyril run by here crying  in a womans bathrobe  well it wouldnt surprise me  youre driving him stark raving mad  what did i do  what you do  running around all up and down  this stupid blimp   against
