bionics  from the greek for like kickass  is there a greek word for insane  yes  i mean i assume there is but  if you think im gonna  let you turn me into some cyborg zombie like katya   whoa whoa whoa whoa no  zombie implies i raised her from the dead  oh then im using it correctly  no youre not  for one thing katya wasnt completely dead  just pretty dead   so pretty  hello  hm  oh so nothing a few hundred thousand volts couldnt cure  the human bodys basically a potato clock  so its gonna look like im leaving  but thats only because im leaving  why wont you let me help you  besides the fact youll probably kill me  yes  because its wrong  and i may have wandered pretty far from the church but i do  still believe there are some things that only god should do  like give you an erection  im assuming you mean give me the ability to have an erection  also yes  no  yes lana  we dont need a  rocket launcher si molto pronto  mmmmmmmneeww not on the preapproved list of equipment for this

 she doesnt know what we need  the last time she was in the field they were still using muskets   really  seriously  no  look dipshit my mother obviously doesnt know about this stuff so   so she goes by my personal professional recommendations  im gonna need you to repeat that  i said  no no shh after i come back there  and pull your tongue out through your  asshole   ew  ew  youd need a bulldozer made of acid to get in here  ooh or spacebot  and if you continue to behave threateningly you havent seen threateningly  youll need one to get out of there  remember spacebot  guys  and so a small power unit goes here on your uh  spiny thing which sends electrical impulses to your muscles and ligaments and  stuff which i will fuse to a vanadium alloy endoskeleton  replacing your current um legbones  i have to say it kind of worries me you dont know the  names of the actual bones  who cares  zrrp theyre in the dumpster  ew  wait then all i need is the power unit not a bunch of vanadium bones  yeah but theyre awesome  but if you dont put everything back where its supposed to go  ive already done it twice  there you go conway  plus when im taking out the old bones i take tons of pictures with my phone  oh well then what could go wrong  seriously  sarcastically  oh  because you could die  i realize that   and ill ya know sign a release form or whatever  oh thats not  necessary  really  no i mean if god forbid the worst happens  theres lots of dumpsters  jesus  sure if he helps  whew okay so when do we do this  well you should already be feeling the effects of the anesthetic

interject here malory this is exactly   what im talking about with the stress  ron  seriously ron why arent you at work  because i spent thirty years building the business so i dont have to be  because i hired good managers  walk into any one of my six dealerships  not six  next year itll be seven sport we just broke ground in white plains  thats actually fairly impressive  you have no idea  with that city council  ron this isnt a car dealership its  the same principle  you build it hire people you trust to manage it  ha  yeah ha   and then you collect the fruits of their labor  because dont please dont take this the wrong way babe   but youre not getting any younger  you said a rocket launcher  i did  i did say a rocket launcher  then give this to whosits  i will  i will give this to whosits  and call me if you ever wanna test drive the new coupe de ville   well i just got a new el camino  oh so youre all set  thatll hold way more hispanics and lawnmowers  wow  i know  thats why i can never stay mad at him  right  wait why were you mad  because i think kriegers doing some kinda bionic shit to rays legs  and archer obviously  would rather see ray dead  jeezy p i mean besides barry and katya what is his deal with robots  servant call an ambulance  yessir right away sir  an ambulance  he needs emergency surgery  and even then itll be a miracle if we can save his testicles  but what could have caused this  mumps  or who knows  the important thing is what are you doing tonight  i  oh  well i said i might meet some people at this thing downtown  but it sounded like itll be pretty heavy on negroes and jazz so   i happen to love negroes and jazz  oh  well then ill just get my coat  and ill wait here  for the ambulance to take your grievously wounded child to the  hospital for emergency surgery  yes woodhouse and then you can go buy some wax for your cross  krieger  oh my god im a little busy right now  yeah i know are you cyborging ray  no  look i think its great if you are  then yes  but i think archers gonna try to stop you  hes kinda freaking out  let him  that door came off the graf spee  to get in here hed need  one rpg7 launcher and two grenades  as per the note from your mother  thank you uh sorry what was your name again  rodney  thank you asshole  what in the  why arent you people on the way to the airport  we may have sort of a uh situation  and what sort would that be   this is what im talking about  ron  if you keep it up this headache you gave me is going to last for  the next three to five nights  look dont worry i can

pretenses is a fireable offense  oh my  i basically just lurch from one fireable offense to the next  ugh like the infamous luau incident  jesus christ how many times do i have to apologize for that  once would be nice  no  rodney open this door  give me that weapon  oh  you mean this rocket launcher  because i bet it would open the door  no that is inadvisable at this time  ya know if i asked it nicely  i seriously wouldnt do that  yeah because youre not awesome  oh and what fresh hell is this  whatever it is they can handle it  they cant even handle a simple luau   my god what they did to
