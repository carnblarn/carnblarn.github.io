for monopoly money oh  minus however much pam ate probably two kilos   or three or whatever  quit eating all the   goddamn cocaine  make me  my point unless pam  ate it is that things could be a lot worse  how you sold a million dollars of  product for this worthless stack of paper  how could it be any worse  i uh hate to agree with archer but it could be  worse these are actually really good fakes  i mean not good enough to deposit in a bank but  good enough to pass in say a deli   yeah i guess but  shut up  so you take a hundred go buy a pack of gum and walk   out with 9950 in change  hey thats brilliant   archer  yeah plus gum  so youre gonna do that 10000 times  well not me personally  not anyone personally its idiotic  what we need is a bigticket item  like a big bag of cocaine  the last thing we need is more cocaine   disagree  because you are   addicted to cocaine  your words  hey wait a second ive got the perfect bigticket  item cadillacs  nope   let me finish  oh im sorry

these  negroes youre suddenly so nuts about   it was 1940  and where am i supposed  to lock up 2000 pounds of cocaine  cyril look around somewhere in this mansion i  have to assume is a gigantic scrooge mcduckian vault  scrooge mcduck eh  sweater   all right where are we  lana did you find an arms dealer  mmm no all weve got so far is spyridon skorpio   and conway stern  geez those are old

oh what about rays brother the pot farmer   he had lots of guns  yeah hes doing life   in prison  now thats the song   you should write  ugh or maybe  one about a crippled cyborg who all he did was pussyache about  being a crippled cyborg  well keep looking and cyril youve got the   product under lock and key  yup in the kitchen  pantry theres no scrooge mcducky   vault  no what  uh how about an oldtimey gymnasium full of   indian clubs and medicine balls  hello   ive finished  there is one of those  oh and it was a good idea to lock up all the   counterfeit money  yeah good job   whoever did that  wait did you not   mmm no i  what   well where the hell is it  welp  ive got good news and good news   amphetamines  right  and i know it sounds crazy but i like them as much as cocaine  where

the deadly and   terrible yakuza  yeah and on a  related note pam what do you thinks gonna happen when they  realize the money is counterfeit  oh my god right can you imagine   yes pam we can  oh my god they chop   off their own fingers  do they know how to   find you  um  well they know i work at isis but that wont do them any good   well thank  although  whooooo domo arigato fellas  two of them

mes not  gonna be playing the violin any time soon   because  because a violin would  probably dissolve in the same big drum of acid they dissolved   that guy in  ew  but if all moto wants is his drugs  then he can give us a refund  of worthless counterfeit money  its not exactly worthless  the right buyer would probably pay about 15 cents on the dollar   for it  what   why didnt you say that  uh i dont know   i assumed you knew  everybody knows that   ron  i say screw the money  lets just give moto his drugs and be glad we dodged   this giant metaphorical bullet  hey and where are we   on that list  malory  oh all right we obviously cant go to war   with the yakuza  uh not without  normalsize nonmetaphorical bullets  but pam if there ever are any this comes out  of your share of the profits   how is that not fair  moto doesnt just want  the pills he also wants my  hehhehhehhead nonmetaphphuhphuhphuhphuh  phorically speaking pam we got it  wait hes still gonna kill you  even if you give back the pills   yes  oh hey hey shh  come on were not gonna let the yakuza kill you  although  christ on drums people what  pam screwed the yakuza out of a million bucks  of amphetamines so

about money he said its a debt of honor  and it can only be paid with pams blood  and since i cant write a genredefining country song  with you people screaming about a horde of chinese  daylight vampires who are probably scuttling up the drain  pipes even as we speak go out there and kill them  dont even get me started on that  how about get started on that list  im not your secretary lana  we dont really have weapons or ammo  youre shitting me   mm no  ugh  whoa i stand extremely corrected  yeah and theyre all loaded  this was the best house to be a kid in  mmm yeah and so anything postworld war i  i dont know i think grandpapa lost interest  once he filled the museum of natural history with  dead animals then he got real big into model  trains and then it was a sort of very long sad slide into  dementia and ultimately into death  and the whole time he was screwing the asses off all the  colored maids no thats a terrible   country song  heres your country  song right here  have you ever heard a country song  um danger zone  okay listen up there are way too many windows and  doors to cover so we need to concentrate on chokepoints  not that kind of chokepoints

hatter  i dont believe it he made it  you never give him enough credit  and honestly not your best trait  you may want to work on that since youll be a mother soon  unless well i suppose that all depends  on what kind of mother you want to be  uh konnichiwa  hmm the doorsan  thanks kato  yoshi  im sorry uh yoshi   is indisposed  you  me scrooch   you must know  hang on  oh god  sorry i dont want to get a dry socket  you must know that even if you kill me the yakuza will  never forgive this debt of honor  they will kill  right thats so bad for your ears  but i get it the bushido code the

what is your proposal  i know the yakuza will hunt us down forever but i  bet you can forgive the debt of honor right  only if blood has been shed  well my stepfa my mothers husband is about a  quart low you shot him so im thinking you take back  all well almost all the pills pam ate a bunch and im  not gonna lie to you i had a couple or six plus you keep   the counterfeit million  but  plus if you dont ill kill you  probably should have led with that  i must accept  but i cannot lose mentsu what you call face  my men must think this was my decision  that you somehow sweetened the deal  well at this point the reds are wearing off  and the bourbons kicking in so uh you can pretty much name  it  that is so true  that was cyril rons in surgery but the bullet  missed everything and his prognosis is excellent  oh my god thats great so   so winwin  wha winwin   ow  malory  a gutshot husband and an idiot son who just  gave away 5 million worth of cocaine  i call that a loseloselose
