tonight im doing a special seating for a bunch of diplomats from the  state department and albania  so not only do i have to create a meal out of yogurt and a goddamn  sheeps head apparently theres been some vague security  threat so my highlytrained staff has been infiltrated   sorry  by shithead squadron  just need to grab some menus for the camera why is there a camera  i assume because this restaurant cant hold three million viewers  twopointeight  because its not promoted properly  this is gonna be televised  yeah the shows called bastard chef  mm scuse me  thank you giraffelady  anyway those isis idiots are doing security and for some inexplicable reason  they have to do that undercover so  whoops  thats probably why i seem annoyed  lets go chet cmon chop chop  youre the one who dropped it why do i have to clean it up  because youre the garon de cuisine which means kitchen boy whereas  i am the sous chef which means shut your face and mop up the damn yogurt  and why do you get to be sous chef  because i have fine dining experience  i used to own a restaurant  it was a burger joint  cyril  i mean chet  archer  she means randy  can i borrow you  sure mitzi  my name is not

be talking to a  tv crew when were undercover  fake names duh followup question do you know how tv actually works  i   theyre not gonna broadcast this episode in this restaurant tonight  wait are you guys  no we  like a closedcircuit deal or  no  because come to think of it i dont know how tv actually works either  how about geopolitics   eh  because if anything goes wrong tonight  usalbanian

no i was obviously being facetious  i would never allow a monkey in my restaurant  except maybe in the form of an exquisitely prepared entre  no i mean youre booked solid for holy shit the next ten months  so why even bother answering the phone  to tell people they cant eat here  so to drive people away basically  those people  thats not even the real phone number for reservations  im sorry  the real numbers a secret  closely guarded by people i deem acceptable  so just so im clear instead of assessing the security needs for  tonight im answering phone calls from people who arent good enough  to eat here in the first place  yeah so try to sound apologetic but not ya know overly so  seize  im sorry we have nothing available for the next ten months  mmmkaybye  keep trying  ugh why  besides i said so  theyre booked  if id known i couldnt get a table id have never  agreed to do security  why do they need security anyway  there was a threat of some sort its all rather vague  but when those
