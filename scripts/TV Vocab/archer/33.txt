so you better break out the purple stuff   im sorry im sure i misheard you sterling has been  missing for two months weve spent god knows how many thousands of dollars and  manhours searching for him and this whole time hes just  down at the shore flipping hamburgers  you know another kind of burger  ostrich shut up theyre good   shut up  yes shut up  then explain to me if you know where sterling is  was  oh according to our intel  he was tracked down by a kgb hit squad   oh my god  sorry  i should have started that with archer is fine  the kgb hit squad  oh my god   not so much  my god   but so where is he now  at a spa  according to hisum wife  his what  linda she said hes name was bob  he wandered in there in full morning dress  married the minute they met   who does that  ostriches  son of a  hes obviously doing this just to get even with me  normally i would agree but after talking to the wife  i honestly think archer  doesnt know hes archer  how could he not know who he is  psychogenic retrograde amnesia  also known as a fluke statement  sometimes triggered by extreme emotional or psychological stress   and we all know what caused that  yes his hatred of seeing me happy  now take me to that spa  and well just see how this amnesia holds up  against a sudden and quite possibly violent confrontation with his mother  babababa  bad idea  according to my clinical research on drug induced amnesia  said the fake scientist   hmm and what are your parents names  what  their names are  um uh  damn it krieger did you drug me  you dont remember  wow memory is such a fragile thing  and if archers real identity is exposed to him too suddenly  his mind may reject it permanently  we have to ease him back into it  like a latex gimp suit  and how do you suggest we do that  well some people use baby powder  im a firm believer in corn starch  not the gimp suit   sterlings amnesia  oh  yes i have a plant  plant  plan  im serious  i want it on record that i think this is a terrible plan  duly noted and disregarded  and i expect you to be totally convincing  as the damsel in distress  have you ever met a woman less damsely  pam and its not you im worried about  its our

the  kgb armed with a frickin cap gun  because unfortunately we were trying to cure your   psychogenic retrograde amnesia  duh  wait so you remember you had amnesia   such a fragile mystery  krieger one more word and  ill make you wish they never scraped you out of hitlers drawers   aww  ew  ew  that is a lot creamier than i remembered  but you do remember why you ran away from home this time  im a grown man lana i didnt run away from home  i carjacked a limo  from a wedding  oh my god its all coming back to me now what part of this  are you not getting  core concept  drive shitheel  wh  where is the limo going  i guess wherever mr archer said to  son of a bitch  your words  burn  ruined  absolutely ruined because of you  i said i was sorry mother   happiest day of my life  wait wasnt that the  day i was born  oww  whats in there  spa buckles  you think that compares to a dream wedding to ron cadillac the biggest  cadillac dealer in new york  technically the whole tristate area    hiya gang  oh ron  thank you for coming so quickly  phrasing first boom  well in a cadillac you dont have to sacrifice speed for luxury  that babyll pass anything on the road except a gas station    and hows my lady love  infinitely better now  i bet now that you found sterling  she was just worried sick about you   well not sick  how the heck are ya son   fine awful whatever great  but mostly mortified  that he ruined our wedding  well alls well that ends well  yeah i dont think it does though  no shit  no i mean the kgb found you at a burger joint when you  didnt even know who you were then they found you here  how did they do that  i  wait yeah howd they do that  barry are we losing our minds  could be other barry could be because even though  i can see archers every frickin move apparently its  impossible to kill that idiot from frickin space  so where are we on the frickin spaceship to get me home  and im lookin your way dr simon   uh well  lemme stop ya right  there in case you were about to say theres been a setback  because thats what dr benes and dr hathaway kept saying  remember those guys  they were workin with you guys on my new spaceship  i murdered them  eh
