newbie  sorry in advance  owww  that hurts like insanely bad  thats why i said sorry in advance and you have to have to  stop yelling extraordinary rendition  a nobody cares  and  be careful  you big lummox   i swear to god if you scuff my bags  oh  i wouldnt dream of it maam  and i can do without the sarcasm  oh no maam that wasnt  enough  with the backchat  ugh lana maybe you can talk to him  um  so this is the infamous kenny bilcoe   you dont look like much of a terrorist  thats because im a  freedom fighter  for a free and sovereign nova scotia  is that why you blew up a donut shop  allegedly  if you believe canadas illegitimate socalled government   im pretty sure we do  which is why were taking  you back to ottawa  and once we do hopefully the mounties will start sending us all kinds of  lucrative work  how noble  speaking of work can i put what i just assume is  your rock collection on the stupid train  yes the  nooope  nice try pam  what  you want to get on that train so you can stowaway  just like on the blimp  the what  okay no biggie  have a nice trip  i  wait a minute  what now  too easy  pams up to something  booooarrrd   well i doubt shell make it on now  ditto for archer  wh  hes not here  mmmmmm nope  need to get these bags on maam  i heard him  george   malory dont call him that  my name actually is george  really  dammit i told sterling six oclock  i thought you meant six am  no six  sterling are you drunk  winnerrrr  nice   archer  you knew we were transporting a dangerous  terrorist to canada  so how and why are you drunk at six oclock  well the hows pretty selfexplanatory and the why is because hic  i thought we were leaving at six am  tomorrow  ergo latin plenty of time to sleep it off  well drink some coffee because theres a good chance  bilcoes terrorist pals  alleged terrorist pals   are going to attack the train at some point  and try to bust him loose  awesome  right  im sorry how is that awesome  because hic pretty much my whole life ive  wanted to fight some guys on the roof of a speeding train  well if i know my boys you may just get your wish big guy  thanks freddy foreshadowing  who is this  please tell me hes a renowned chickenandwaffle chef  because i am starving    so listen you look like a pretty smart guy  well thanks   i like to think so  so why dontcha do yourself a prettysmartguy  favor and just let me go   uh because ms  archer would kill me  well what do ya thinks gonna happen when my boys storm this train  oh im not too worried about that  ya should be  my boys are bad ass  well so am  lana  and im learning  oh and dont forget about archer  the drunk guy  he may have seemed drunk but hes still drinking  relax lana its just a bloody mary  and by the way not a great one  mr vodka and ketchup  archer at any time in the next twelve hours this train could be  attacked by radical nova scotian separatists  armed with what  pamphlets about canadas responsible gun control laws  the new scotland front has guns  and theyre not afraid to use them so  so okay  god ill switch to coffee  hey heinz 56 can i get an irish coffee  no  lana i have to taper off  trust me if these noma scojens are a real threat you do not want me hungover  do you even still get hangovers  normally no but i drank about two gallons of  mamajuana this afternoon  i was playing dominoes with a dominican bike gang or was it mahjong  i dont remember  ridiculous  this things a sardine can  how are people supposed to travel like this  most people bring less luggage  most people fly  so your days of sullen superiority are numbered  i have no response to that  they never do  now lets go find a bigger compartment  im afraid there arent any  nonsense im sure theres one here somewhere  why are these all locked  theyre occupied  so if you dont mind  what i mind is your familiar tone young man  whats through here  those are private cars maam  what do you mean private  i mean theyre not  not for you to be knocking on  now i have to insist that you  get yer panties untwisted   damn wh  i knew it  i want this train stopped immediately and this stowaway forcibly disembarked  afraid i cant do that maam  you can and you will or ill have your job  no she wont george  carol  what are you doing here  uh trying to perform my ablutions  but  this is miss tunts private car  how do you have a private train car  uh cause she owns the railroad  well half  and i knew you wouldnt let us go on this stupid trip to canada so i had my  cars hooked up  cars  plural  this car two sleeping cars a private dining car  and one thats just a teeny tiny skating rink  er two sleeping cars  do you think there might be room for  nooope  its already cramped back there what with that pissreeking ocelot  plus george says you stiffed him  wh  no i didnt i gave him a tip  a stick of gum  well  really  did you not have a button  you button it missy  oh we dont know the meaning of private lets all pile in  lana check it out  actual gas lamps  amazing archer yes so you think we can go guard the  prisoner now or  rrowr  is that babou  or not  apparently  okay  wowww  lana  cyril  jesus  lana  and pam  lanaaaaa  what  he remembers me  cyril why are you in here  i didnt know where you guys were  it doesnt matter where we are newb gingrich   then get out  wheres the prisoner  in my compartment   at least he was  although he doesnt seem to be in here now  no kidding  mmmmmm nope  archer lana  cyril   oh my god  too late hes gone  thanks to cyril  well hes not gonna jump off a train going eighty miles an hour so   so yeah  well sweep car by car moving from front to back  good you guys do that ill get a big raw steak from the kitchen  are you talking about the ocelot  are you not  im talking about the prisoner   oh  well maybe theyre together  although i doubt it babous kind of a loner  like paul newman in hud  if paul newman had constantly sprayed piss all over um oh what was her  patricia neal  who i hate  sorry for the intrusion folks  nothing to worry about just some standard umtrain security  okay thats all the regular cars  now we get to search all the sleeper cars thanks to your incompetence  well you left me unsupervised  so this is my fault  mmm fiftyfifty  fiftyfifty you accidentally shoot somebody newb  now come on itll take us all night to search this damn train   well but with archer helping  i wouldnt exactly call it helping  here kitty kitty kitty  kitty  excuse me is there an ocelot in there  no no no whatre you doing  besides making a ms all over my train  looking for a terrorist and an ocelot what   not necessarily in that order  okay thats it were stopping   frank this is george we gotta  give me that  hes gotta keep the train at top speed so they cant get off  so tell him to keep it floored  i will do no such thing  okay then here hold this  why are you giving me a  oh my  sorry but im not letting a terrorist escape  and obviously an ocelot wouldnt survive in the frozen wasteland  of upstate new york  so  sorry frank uh miss tunt says she wants to beat  the record run to ottawa  those crazy tunts  okay hang on  jesus   boys hang on a sec  okay boys make sure you bring the heavy  stuff cause these crazy isis bastards arent playing  they just killed a black guy  i know right  welcome to america  how is that racist  never mind look  i treat all servants exactly the same  regardless of their race  hang on i hear freedom ringing  at worst im elitist  but not racist  whatever  cyril and i searched the front half of the train but we didnt see any sign of  bilcoe okay so  i bet its hard to see   anything from that high horse  so   unless archer found bilcoe in the back half of the train  which no  he didnt  jeezy petes  archer  is that blood  what  oh  yeah but its from a cow  you shot a cow  and bilcoes not in the back half so you guys mustve missed him  which no we didnt  which yes obviously you did  or you did  or you did  because theres no way he got off were moving too fast  oh my god we totally are  we might beat the record run  you guys probably dont understand because dont own a railroad  but its actually a pretty huge deal  to whom  railroad owners  were a pretty competitive bunch  no pam  no means no now stop it  whatsa matter  ya chicken  im in a wheelchair  ow  bawk bawk bawk bawk bawk bawk  ow  goddammit pam i dont wanna race  couple skate  i cant believe you have a skating rink train car  yeah apparently my greatgrampa was nuts for skating  that and the klan  i  okay so lets try this again  car by car this time back to front  good because miss stingy here wont let me eat in her private dining car  oh my god weve been over thaaaat   so when you pass the dining car have a porter bring me a cobb  salad  before or after we

blood  yeah i assume at some point hell come out to like lick it  come on weve only searched two cars  so weve got a shitload to go  uh speaking of i need to make use of the facilities here  fine but
