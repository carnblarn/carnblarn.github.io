                murphy os time and tide they wait for no man  murphy nor do i mr tunt nor do i and unless my demands are  met i will launch my nerve gas missiles on new york  washington and miami in eleven hours and  oh look at  that eleven minutes hey make a wish  cecil uh i wish you wouldnt launch nerve gas missiles on  new york washing murphy and i wish you fools  would stop destroying the oceans overfishing industrial runoff dont even get me  started on whaling oh and plastic bottles thats   i cant even  there is a floating mass of garbage in the pacific  twice the size of the united states oh and where the hell  is the news crew i asked for  cecil with me and with your permission im sending them down in the dsv  murphy good yes i need to get my message to the world  whod you get oprah  cecil bigger  lana ya know murphy hello is that her  lana i  oh right he cant see us  murphy which has really got me nettled  murphy alright mr tunt send them down but if this is some sort of ruse  cecil are  was there a followup or  murphy no i was leaving the consequences to your  imagination but trust me they are grave as in watery grave  cecil i  murphy sealab out  god damn it off turn

snotty with  me missy you people lure us out here to help the government  recover a hydrogen bomb lana which lets be honest  you were going to hold for ransom  malory reward when the whole time you knew this crazy murphy  character was going to bomb new york with nerve gas  cecil well  lana not to mention dc and miami  malory which no one who matters will miss  lana what about your south beach condo  malory hello florida real estate collapse its farther  underwater than sealab but if my homeowners policy covers  nerve gas attacks thats a winwin  lana wow so my question ignoring the obvious one of why  an ocean research lab has nerve gas missiles in the first  place is how many men does murphy have  cecil mmmmmlike two  lana oh then   cecil score two score so  around forty sorry shouldve  finished that thmmpf  lana sooo since were talking about forty hostiles i  have a follow up question  archer something something danger zone  lana ahhhhh  archer i know im not even trying anymore

archer duh yes lana so obviously theyre gonna search  us for weapons when we get down there so wait whaaaaaaaat  something else danger zone  lana get murphy alone get him at gunpoint and make him  disarm the missiles ya know that might actually work  archer of course itll work ive thought through every aspect of the mission  lana hence those ridiculous fake mustaches since murphys  never seen
