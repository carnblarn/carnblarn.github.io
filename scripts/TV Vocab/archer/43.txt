priest  for your infor im in turn it off  okay  jesus  shit  for your information lana i have totally prepared for this mission  well theres a firs first thing i did was  watch every episode of lucy daughter of the devil which  by the way was grossly inadequate preparation  for an undercover mission protecting the pope from an assassination attempt  i was gonna say underrated but   but even if you were prepared which i truly feel that i am   but which youre not whos your backup if rays not going cyril   no  no it turns out cyril  aaagh  how bout a little warning  has a thing about church stuff  since when  since none of your beeswax and bwoohahaahaaa  aaagh  well  and i think i need a spanking because i have been a very  naughty baaaaagh  guess that explains that but it doesnt explain  how archers gonna run this mission by himself  well if you were confused verging on angry   before  aaagh  what  jesus christ shit god damn it  pam  what  pam  what  paaaam  whaaat  i dunno whatre we

ceremonial  obviously theyre ceremonial they were made obsolete by the arquebus  which is why now they use mp5s  oh  which is why wheres the gear bag with all of our automatic weapons  well i assume in the hotel room but god   i thought they just had halberds  do you at least have a sidearm  it was ruining the lines of my cassock  dammit  and again i honestly thought they just had   halberds although technically i think theyre called voulges  santo padre la porta per favore  i got him just toss him down  im not tossing the frickin pope  somehow this is all your fault  che  oh for the this is the pope  oh then woodhouse  oof  ow oh for shits sake already  archer shut up and find us some  sparale  oof transport are you shitting me  well it was this or the vespas its not my fault  italys

swiss guard uniforms driving a swiss guard car  esatto  holy sh  its a false flag operation to make it look  like the swiss guard  who told you i was to be assassinated  cardinal corelli he he wouldnt by any  chance be next in line for the papacy would he  well there would be an election   right with the smudgepot   but corelli would be sure to win  pretty good motive  yeah you must make a shitlo  ahhhhhhhh  go whatre you doing  im letting them catch up  why  can i finish he asked agentincommandingly  take the wheel and maintain speed woodhouse lighter  im only ninety pounds wet sir  what no

 so the good news is my men have apprehended cardinal corelli who  immediately confessed to the plot  hey heyyy that is good news  you know how the whole the good news is thing works right  the bad news is oh right   the men you killed were camorra  whatre they like the mafia  the camorra is like your mafia like  seal team six is like the girl scouts  exactly  so equally sexy  eww  oww  oww  but the real good news ow dick is that we saved the popes life  for which we are grateful however we cannot tell   these two apart so  so i actually have an idea about that  is it take them both home see which ones a better  butler and give the other one back to the catholic church  never mind  then why dont we leave them both here until they come  to im sure woodhouse never gets a vacation  are you kidding i didnt even let him go to his brothers funeral  what  oh my  you asshole  was he crushed  probably woulda been  if id told him about it  ugh but wait why did corelli hire isis to prevent the assassination  to show the cardinals he was trying to  prevent it all the while assuming what that wed totally  blow my god he assumed wed totally blow it  well isis has a certain reputation  hey whoa not cool payne stewart  oh my god if malory ever  hears about this   which she wont  because pam  what  promise youll never tell mother  okay i promise swear to god  what  pam pam  haaaaa
