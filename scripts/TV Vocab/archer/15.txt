do any work  yeah so can we go home absolutely  right after you idiots deworm the entire computer network  howre we supposed to do that  well i could take a crack at it dont touch it  cyril  go do whatever it is you do like suck at stuff  and leave this to people who are more qualified  at not sucking at stuff  cyril beat it  krieger is on this  i think  i mean least i have a hunch hunch  what what  ahem inappropriate  what do you mean  no i mean the first part worked  i snuck into the mainframe last night after all the champagne and the uh  handjobs  yeah the twins are quite fond of you  i loaded that into the mainframe splendid  then open your dish  but part two where i use your secret code to kill the worm and kinda  be the hero for once that didnt happen  dont worry about it open your dish  no thanks cyril  i got that specially for you and quite frankly youre insulting me  now open  your dish  sorry george i didnt mean to be george theres money in there  oh good for a second i thought theyd brought you chicken toes or something  george why is there money in there  cyril ive been just a teeny bit less than honest with you  oh no no now its nothing sinister  i design computer security systems  cia mi6 odin all the biggies  you must be pretty good at it  too good thats the problem  my systems cant be hacked so now i cant convince anyone to upgrade  which is why i designed this  and thanks for helping me test it  if its that easy on an xl9 network like the one at isis  i think i can convince my clients theyre at risk  wh  what kind of risk  not from this its just a cute little pirate  but it shows there are flaws out there that can be exploited  by bad people  trust me its for the greater good  yeah i guess it just seems look if youre uncomfortable  taking the fifty grand ill just no no fifty grand   wow no i mean as long as its for the greater good  oh it is  and as long as i can still ya know swoop in and save the day  ok  that might be a problem  ya think  i do  because now the worm is in the mainframe databanks and  dammit pam  sorry  i was just checkin to see if its still doin it  of course its still doing it  hunch hunch  what what  pam thats not me  yes it is  pam i swear to god  yeah quit screwing around pam  this is serious very  because if the worm gets into the mainframes encrypted files  holy shit the identity of every single isis field agent is on there  so what  because most secret agents dont tell every harlot from  here to hanoi that they are secret agents  then why be one  hunch hunch what what  just turn off the mainframe  yeah we tried that then how is it still on  because the worm has transformed the mainframe into a sentient being  what  im kidding theres a battery backup  yeah over there  behind about two tons of steel and one electronic lock  which is controlled by the mainframe  well what genius thought that up  this one  sorry  and where the hell have you been  on agency business  at the bank  sesame ginger savings and loan  whats all this  this is the backbreaking work weve been doing while you were getting takeout  from your stupid chinese bank  every single one of these has to be wiped reformatted the whole shmeel  what but its just a little cartoon pirate  was but it mutated and now were like on the brink of world war two  three  its not a competition pam  well is it or isnt it  i dont know i mean the mainframe thinks theyre nuclear missile launches  but its so screwed up hunch hunch what what  sorry  case in point theres really no way to be sure  so what am i supposed to do just look out the window  no you dont wanna be anywhere near a window  same thing in a tornado  and they cant even turn off the stupid mainframe because  some stupid battery thing is in some stupid vault  but they dont need to turn off the darn it i can fix this  oh please he couldnt fix dinner  he doesnt need to with a bank like not a real bank  dammit  sorry but i have no idea how to open this thing  not really my legerdemain  you mean bailiwick  i dunno whatever look out  whatre you archer no  for the love of god man  you massive ssshole  im sorry i thought that would work  really no look at that thing  its like its made out of wolverines bones  you know  cause theyre  does nobody read xmen  so hey how about i take a crack  i bet i can kill that pesky old worm  how  ya gonna disappoint it to death  hey ya know what  yes i do  beat it cyril let the grownups work  but leave this im starving  no gimme that  hey wait a damn minute i said i was hungry  great  rrrrungh  there now we dont have to reformat all those stupid things   brilliant  right  totally  because hows the elevator supposed to work with a jillion  pounds of frickin computers on it  who am i elisha otis  cmon pick up pick up pick up cyril  whats going on with you  nothings going on  hi youve reached george spelvin por espanol  hated that phone  always dropping calls  probably holding it wrong  oh yeah just like cyril figgis always does everything wrong  is that what you mean  basically  well for your information cyril figgis knows how to beat the worm  i bet  the computer worm  krieger cant even beat it  krieger whos virtual girlfriend is so real the state of new york  is allowing him to legally marry her  oh kureegasan  soon we will to be married yes  very soon my little cherry blossom would you please focus  nooooo  kureegasan  nooooo you maniac  you blew her up  oh damn you  god damn you all to hell  so hows this going  not great  the worms decrypting the isis agent list and then apparently  its going to upload them to an offsite server  oh my god plus now im going to die alone  and once the worm decrypts the cover list and uploads it  to whoever is  behind this foul deed  every isis agent in the field will be exposed  and probably killed  oh my archer do something  who am i alan turing  also from xmen  sterling what  are we keeping you from something  no well  well what cyril was just  right here like one second ago  so where are we whats the plan  im going to sell it  the russians maybe the north koreans famine or no  theyve got a shitload of money  but you cant do that  one moment darlings of course i can  once my little worm uploads the list to my server  but its not yours  you stole it  bought it from you  well then sell it back to me  cant you just said you could  well wont then whatever  look take the money back  heres the almost fifty thousand  count it  youd still be about three zeros short  fifty million  sellers market  but thats not fair oww  it is exactly fair  you made a choice  and just like every other choice that every other human being has ever made  it has a consequence  but i just wanted to show them i could them  or maybe your father who never thought you quite measured up  he how did you know that   just a guess really  okay okay what if what if i get you the fifty million  one is inclined to ask how  well i happen to be a kickass accountant  did that sound a lot better in your head  yes it did  damn thas over half the cover list  krieger we dont have much time  can you stop the worm or not  oh i thought we were putting all our eggs in the batteryshutdown basket  no it could take hours for this thing to bypass the electronic lock  well then i better get my turtleneck  archer hey so uh you busy yes  or no i dunno  whos asking
