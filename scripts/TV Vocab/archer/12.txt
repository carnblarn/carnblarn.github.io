idiot   why  why didnt you just get the vasectomy like i ask you to   honestly i thought it would hurt  and this doesnt   itits apples and oranges   im not ready to be a grandmother  really but youre so  grandmotherly  no old  if and when i am ready for a grandchild  it wont be the potato face spawn   of some irish whore  exactly its probably not  i mean seriously whatre the odds on that   so she had a lot of ugh  you kidding  i used to have to book her weeks in advance   although  although what  um whew  wow trinette that was amazing  yeah that wh  wait a minute    you liar  this aint a condom wrapper its from a frickin candy bar  so sometimes i like to treat myself  well sometimes i like to ovulate  well i gotta sleep so do it somewhere else  moneys on the dresser  nothing  hundredtoone hes mine  well he better not be  my god i couldnt bear the shame it would bring on this   family to have um  no  please mother finish that thought  oh my god youre such a hypocrite  you were gonna say illegitimate child  no i was going to say bastard  ouch  i mean thats gotta hurt huh  why should i care if archer knocked up some dumb hooker  because babies are softskulled fat little germsacks and now weve all  been exposed to that ones bacteria  what  dont engage her  but cmon lana you dated mr archer forever and  and you have nothing to show for it  paging doctor loggins  couple things one i dont need a baby to validate my existence  two the absolute last person on earth id have a baby with  is archer because he is not sold separately  did you try yeah ill come over mother  just gimme 20 minutes    well im sorry lana  but i didnt invent the childproof pill bottle  so as far as archers concerned i actually feel like i dodged the worlds most  dysfunctional bullet  yeah but cyril was oh wait  did he have some sort of character flaw  hello hello hello  couple things    yeah we are code blue here  hey yeah blue  like for baby boys   no i meant like for her face but  no like for lets have a  baby shower for trinette and the wee baby seamus  oh my god yes  but youre place is disgusting so where can we have it  well archers got that bangin pad  ooh hell hate that  i wanna come  ooh i think i just did  and so thank you both for coming  even though mr archer is the only party named in the subpoena  well we both have invested interest  in the outcome of this silly test  and said test will obviously be administered by a third party so  a third party  but we have a stateoftheart laboratory at isis    normally i wouldnt let an intern do this on his first day but  chet  hows it hanging buddy  im sure you do  but our client has concerns about the integrity of the test results  given your agencys clandestine nature  oh and by the way supercrazy about that elevator pretending its a dryer  barry  but all kidding aside odin will be providing security for the paternity test   odin  oh yeah  hello archer  barry   hows it hanging buddy  hanging great barry  hows the leg  barry does it hurt  cause it looks like it kinda hurts  it did hurt and it still does so so how can trinette afford odin  this is pro bono  consider it payback for my shattered femur  and that reminds me doctor ben  wh and what the hell is this  we take a blood sample from archer my god  what year is this i know right  why cant you just take a dna swab  a blood sample is enough to determine paternity  and after we take a liter a liter  how much is a owww  archer will be left in a weakened state which should prevent his attempting to  compromise the test  turtlenecks i invented those  youre bleeding him dry  sersly barry how much is a liter  about 8 gills  whats a gill youre just talkin in circles thanks doctor ben  next  under odin guard the sample is taken to the vault of first savings bank  i dont know why i told you where but it doesnt matter as the  bank and vault will be surrounded by odin agents  merely an added precaution as the vault is basically one big  shitstorm of antiintrusion devices  tomorrow in full view of both parties we will test the sample  here along with a blood sample from wee baby seamus thus  ensuring complete accuracy of the paternity test  any questions  yeah barry im still unclear on the liter thing  visavis uh unit of volume  i seriously dont feel good at all  thats because those odin ghouls drained a fifth of your blood  oh hey speaking of fifth a drinks the last thing you need  well you might want one too cause pretty decent chance the babys mine  what  what happened to a hundredtoone  i may have uh massaged that number  how can i show my face around town if trudy beekman  will eat me alive for this  decent chance  oh oh oh and i can just forget all about getting on the board at the met  the museum or the opera  either  sterling malory archer you are going to break in that vault  and replace your blood with someone elses  someone elses blood  yeah great ill just have igor bring a villager up to my castle  oh igor  yeesss  oh evening sir  hello mum  woodhouse what the hell is this  its a baby shower  whats it look like ya puke  ugh  i think i could use a drink  sterling  pick a villager  why did you let

need this  its some plastic dry cleaner bags  oh and a book about sids  wh  what kinda shit gift is that  yeah right  i made mine  me too  thats disgusting  if i wanted to look at your bare feet id sneak in and  do it while you were asleep  well  have you picked out a donor  yeah  i dunno if its the blood loss or what but this whole thing feels  pretty stupid archer  getting a hooker pregnant  yikes  cyril oh sorry ms archer  im sure the board at the met will frown on this  im sure i dont care for your tone  well i dont care to be judged by a couple of lousy hookerbaby havers  you were

maybe that one time when we had that little scare wh  is that a frickin candy bar  yeah but think you need the calories  you are such a prick  who dragged out all this old crap  why are you and mother in my room going through my things  because ill save you some time my diarys  by the barbie playhouse and the keys in a locket on mr teddy  my god i havent seen this junk in look at that his little

where you at mama  and whyre you calling me right now  i had to before its too late i what  i dont want you to do it sterling what  i know you didnt plan on this baby but sterling  sometimes the unexpected things can turn out to be the most  important things in the whole world  wow you sound shitfaced  oh listen to you  mr melon balls  and the yes maybe ive had a few  and even though i was not always mother of the year  i can change  and you can change and maybe together we could  add up to one good parent for this baby  but im like right here and im right here for both of you  mother im not sure im ready  sterling no ones ever sure theyre ready for a child  thats why its scary and thats why its so special  so please dear do the right thing  god the one time in my life she acts like a human being and its now  was it when i wanted a puppy no  was it when i wanted cornrows no  but maybe shes right i mean the kids cool and im  obviously awesome so maybe i would be a good father  ya know at some point in the future  waaaagh  waaaagh  aww youre okay taterhead  they only took a little bit of blood  yeah quit being such a baby  you quit bein such a baby  you prick  shut up  they took a liter from me  and as the 24 hours of uninterrupted vault footage  shows said liter was never except for those nine frames of  static there out of sight of odin personnel  we get it lets move on barry  and since you all witnessed the blood sample being taken  from the wee baby seamus i hereby cede  any and all rights to ever contest the results of this paternity test  move on barry  and so said test results conclude exciting isnt it  not really because its gonna say that archer is in fact the father  what  wait a minute  no thats probably the most expensive candy bar you ever ate ya dunce  really super expensive  thats a schedule for child support payments  first of the month works best for us  no wait  somebody coulda broken in the vault  cmon nine frames is a glitch  because even if somebody did break into that vault no one  no one archer could ever prove it  but and whod even want to  not a handsome blond cripple like me  so kudos buddy  lets go drink some kudos yeah lets do that  clink clink  i dont understand how this happened  well from what i can tell it had something to do with  disgustingly kinky sex and a candy bar but  a candy bar mother  i am not the father it was cyril  that thing is huge  i mean how did you even get you sonuva snackeatinass bitch  im sorry  how can you cheat on lana bareback  im a sex addict  thats not even a real thing  and the guilt from sex makes me binge then i feel fat  then i turn to sex to feel attractive again then its just this vicious cycle  shitass  dont you see  the wee baby seamus is cyrils  and barry just wanted to frame me  you dont fool me  you had the chance to make the switch but you couldnt  no yes i could  and i never thought id say this but sterling you did the right thing  no i didnt  well the thing i thought was right but not ya know  what people think is right  well maybe youre turning into people  but i dont wanna be people  and i didnt want to be a grandmother  but cest la vie dear  yeah and cest la child support  well just tighten your belt my belt  you said you were here for us  i am dear but with the economy how it is what  my money isnt  youre in a limousine  and if i wanted to sit around all day going nowhere id be a teacher  sorry dear i have a fitting  ciao  fitting  and thats why people in this family shouldnt have children  that and a genetic predisposition toward ants  wh wretched horrible ants  ants are gonna be the least of your worries smackhound  running around barefoot like that  hello hookworms  get in my feet  or whatever  some kinda worms  will go in your feet
