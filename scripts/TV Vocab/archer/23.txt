how is it misplaced im on my honeymoohooon  well at least you got a honeymoon  my fiance was murdered   wait what  yeah  oh and you married an idiot  who plays thirtysix holes of golf on the first day of his honeymoon  because not to whatever but that cannot bode well for your marriage  get the hell out you piece of shit  seriously i hope she didnt sign a prenup because  oh my god  hey so what happened was somebody ordered room service  but the regular room service guy uh he died so i came in  here and fell on the bed  wait youre not her husband  and youre not one of my dick bosses so can i help you or  yes you can quickly and quietly walk down to the dock  and board my seaplane  okay a rhetorical and b your what  seaplane  looks like an airplane had a baby with a boat  i know what a seaplane is idiot  and yet youre surprisingly unclear on the  phrase quickly and quietly  and even more unclear on who you are  names rip riley  your mother hired me to bring you back sterling  she what  i mean who  im randy see  so you can just go back to that other guys mother and tell  her that even if you did find that other guy  hes never coming back to isis  wait did you say isis or  how did isis suddenly get in the mix is what im asking  and im asking you for the second and last time  to get on that plane  ya wanna try and make me  no i dont  and i promise  you dont want that either  hey so listen i think we got off on the wrong foot  but im willing to ya know let bygones be gone by the wayside  good to know but im there yet  well give it some time  speaking of how long is this stupid flight   eh about forty hours in the air  hooray  but i have to islandhop to refuel  old lucy goosey here only has a range of about a thousand nautical miles  making it wildly impractical got it  this plane is totally practical  maybe for this ridiculous image youre trying   to cultivate for yourself  what image  sky captain of yesteryeeear  at least im not sky captain of i ran away from home  i didnt run away from home  im a grown man  whose fiance was murdered in front of his very eyes  so excuse me for needing some time to grieve  by tending bar and banging newlyweds  apparently thats my grieving process  and also i need to use the bathroom  a its called the head  and b no  pee in your pants  yeah wrong number  and ive literally had nothing but liquor and mangoes for three months  so unless you wanna fly a thousand nautical miles sitting next to that  okay im setting the autopilot  but this better not be a ruse  a ruse  brrring brrring  hello  hi its the 1930s can we have our words and clothes and shitty airplane  back  lets go kid  call ya back 1930s  and hey watch out for that adolf hitler  hes a bad egg  no one pedal fills it with water   i did that  and the other pedal flushes it  no it doesnt  ugh you come try i gotta choke down this gag reflex  yeah ha ha  quit being a dick for five seconds and unlock the door  it doesnt have a lock  dammit im gonna puke and theres no room  in the toilet or the sink  what the helld you put in the sink  a ruse  you big dumb idiot  and also a bunch of shaving cream and toilet paper  just because  and where does malory get off implying we didnt try our  best to find archer  no she straight up said it  what she implied was that were jealous of archer  and that you hate yourself cause youre still attracted to him  i  thats  what  oh please youre so hot for him i could  reheat this chili in yer cooch  dont you have some humans to resource  actually no  most of my jobs dealing with sexual harrassment  complaints against mr archer so are we gonna some cooch chili  or what  wuzza wuzz what in the holy hell are you doing  well it was gonna be an old fashioned  but i couldnt find any bitters so  how long was i out  hard to say  after i shaved and stuff i took a pretty long nap so   uncuff me you idiot  holy god if we overshot our chance to refuel  i thought you put it on autopilot  it just maintains course and altitude  it doesnt know how to find the only airstrip within a thousand  miles so it can land itself when it needs gas  well then i misunderstood the concept  uncuff me  okay god  wait first promise you wont take me back to isis  isis  youll be lucky if i can get us back to land  now uncuff me  okay god  wait a minute  is this a ruse  because if it is  pretty elaborate  dammit  there goes number two  but it can land on water right  i mean isnt that the whole point  its a kinda different story when were  dropping like a ton of bricks  damn i can barely hold her level  want me to help steer or  havent you done enough already  wh how is this suddenly my fault  okay this is it  cmon lucy goosey you can do it  looking good girl i think were gonna be okay  wait you didnt put the wheels down  the wh  noooo  woooooo  two personal records  for breath holding and number of sharks shot in the frickin face  did you see that  dude are you even alive  no that sides too low  well i cant tell from here  well i can and its too low   i think you mean premature  whatd you say  nothing  its just that archer obviously doesnt want to come back  so i dont know how rileys gonna get him on a plane   which i bet will crash  yeahhh  now you listen  sterling is coming home safe and sound and when he does itll be no  thanks to you people so you can forget about getting carvel  aww cookie puss  wuzza wuzz what the what in the holy  hell are you doing now  ugh wondering why this is called a dration  oughta call it a yration  as in hey this tastes like catshit  theyre not candy bars jackass theyre survival rations  and they might have to last us a while   umm  you son of a  okay that is it  as of right now im  what the  looking for this  give me that weapon  no youre agitated  im agitated because you crashed my plane in the god  knows if its even the middle of the pacific ocean  yeah which youre floating on and not getting shit out of  a shark in  wait what  i saved you from a shark  lets see after i pulled you out of that shitheap of a plane  but before i gave you cpr and bandaged your head  oh  well thanks  youre welcome  sorry i ate so much food  yeah that was a pretty dick move  if it makes you feel any better i puked most of it up   it doesnt  rafts pretty bobby  well weve got a few gallons of fresh water  a desalinator for when that runs out lets see  flare gun and some flares fishing gear oh  and this guy  what is that  emergency beacon   beams a signal directly to the isis satellite  oh well thats  just great  now i get to deal with this as my hot meatball sub congeals  into a big fat disappointing blob of shit  nobodys gonna touch that  yeah  so i figure three days for isis to get a rescue team out here  nice  so we just kick back catch a few rays catch some sushi  well its not gonna be a picnic but   hey can i check that thing out  okay but dont mess with the knobs ive  got the frequency all set so  hey thanks guglielmo marconi  who i think invented the radio  over  but if the emergency beacon is going off   oh my god their plane crashed  i said that would happen and it did  what if i have psychokinetic powers  i dunno just try to only use em for good  no  well  dont just sit there sweating like a gigantic cheese  do something  ow and i am  our satellites locked on the beacon which is jeez  the middle of nowhere  lana ray  get there this instant  uh sorta following up on his thing about the  middle of nowhere how  the black titanium corporate card  i thought it was just a myth  like a big beautiful nolimit unicorn  charter a private jet to honolulu then i dont care if you have  to buy a plane get out there and find him  wait no thats not in the budget  say budget to me again cyril  save your receipts please  and call me the very instant you have an update  and you  you lose my son youll have to drink your meatballs subs through a straw  again ow  and again the satellite is locked on the beacon so unless he  i dunno throws it away wh why the hell would he do that  i told you  im not going back there   well you say that  riley no shit i will shoot you  and then ill shoot you  with a flare  and then ill use a dration bar and two survival crackers to  make smores over the crackling fire that used to be your chest cavity  god damn dude  sorry but youre acting really crazy  well  being a spy makes you crazy  i mean what kind of job is that where your fiance gets murdered  hello stress   dont even get me started on my mother i mean she   she can be  a steelclad bitch i know why do you think i left isis  wh you were an isis agent  briefly way back  didnt work out because ya know your mother  was impossible to please right   god if you only knew  what  how much your mom loves you  you would at least have the heart to go tell her youre  quitting in person  eesh   rather get shot with a flare  oh man up  talk to your mother  then you can go be a bartender and destroy a new marriage every week  cmon that marriage was doomed  and so are we if we dont work together out here so truce  uh ya and hey were not doomed  look  over here hey  no no no wait get down  wh  dont you wanna get rescued  yeah but those could be pirates  okay well theyll just have to do til we  find some cowboys and indians  what  what what  whatre you talking about  im sorry i didnt know pirates werestill a real thing  man this is not at all what i pictured  i mean you hear pirate ship  you think sails cannonballs oh and not one of these guys has a beard   you done  hang on  planks now im done  because the fact that were still alive tells me they  wanna try to r  dont say rape  ransom us  awesome  compared to rape  which seems like a thing pirates would do  but those numbskulls who picked us up were so drunk   now that did seem piratey   they forgot to search me  well unless youve got a bunch of navy seals   stuffed in your pants  no  ive got the signal beacon  so  so we just stall the pirates until the isis rescue  team shows up boards the ship and takes em all out  bing bang boom  which is funny why  well gee where do i start  i will start with the caviar and the 38 montrachet  then do the kobe tartare with this 42 lapin  and then this chocolate terrine looks insaaane  and then i guess just send me to fat camp and pray to god  i dont eat all those fat delicious little chiddrens  because i will gobble them up  wow isis has really gone downhill  but there must be some good agents  it kills me to say it but it maybe lana  ray i doubt thats what malory had in mind when she gave  us the card  ya know we are on a rescue mission  ugh  rescue me from myself such a fatty  but even so i wouldnt put all my rescue eggs in that basket  well  you got a better plan  i dont im not really a planner  my process is a little more organic  datang  untuk kapten  so lets just play it by ear see where the afternoon takes us  see  this is why i like to keep it loose  i mean the wines crap but

thousand miles and the beacons been  headin straight for it at about twenty knots  so a ship must have picked them up  but ive never even heard of pangu  is there a naval base there or  mmmnot exactly   its more of a uh  pirate fortress  no yeah i just wanted to make sure you said  the phrase pirate fortress  which apparently yes you did say the word pirate  followed by the word  fortress   that is the word my english so crap  eh i bet you just need  more practice  try this jerkins youre a douchebag  funny stuff  jehkin you dooshaback  keep at it  oh and hey did we cross the international date line  because i can change the date for you on that omicron spacemaster  eh  yeah okay dumb guy  wouldnt want to be walking around like a  dickhead  with the wrong date on your omicron spymaster  wh
