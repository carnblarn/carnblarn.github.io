with  odin ho oy f barr aoh i  forgot to mention the whole  naked laser thing dillon  odin isnt some coed  freshman dorm where everyone  runs around screwing  im sorry framboise its not you  i mean its not me either  obviously  but in the office  you dont sex on the women at isis  constantly but its not allowed and  actually its probably illegal  but here  framboise here we are one big famille  yeah and the uh famille thing actually makes  this borderline creepy  perhaps if you tried it from behind  yeah lets try that  dont get any on that snappy suit  dont you have better things to  do than mince around and gawk  about a million  but cheryl was scared to come in  here so i took time out of my  busy mincing schedule to tell  you that you have a phone call  is it sterling  i am sure i dont know  do you know youre a little bitch  will you remember this conversation  probably not no  well then off  whoa whoa whoa with the language  you kiss your mother with that mouth  you leave bub out

femur and the gunshot wound  and  i dont know if you knew  this  but framboise and i were kind of engaged  i did not know that  yeah trexler and i served her up like a pudding  well engaged to be

can you do that  oh my god  that framboise is a freak huh yeah  no as a matter of fact i dont have barry on speed dial  well gee thats rather surprising  you know whats surprising  kissing you goodbye at the  airport dozing off in first  class and then seeing you on my  flight when i get up to pee  that to me is rather surprising  and really expensive turns out  just   seriously  i mean i dont want to sound  like a jerk but that framboise  chick mustve been a prostitute  before she got this gig  in like bangkok  i was almost embarrassed for her  where we going anyway  were headed down to
