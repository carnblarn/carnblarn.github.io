                ahhh oh man is this great   no archer its  was that a rhetorical question   archer archer  and also was that  answer yes they both were because new orleans is my kind of town  and i havent had a vacation in forever   lana well thats great but  nola  the crescents city   the big easy  our mission is to stop an ecoterrorist  from blowing up the biggest natural gas pipeline in north america  so i wouldnt exactly call it a vacation  well whatever working vacation  cause im not too worried about some drumcircling hippie treehugger  sir can you find your seat for me  yeah its right there  can you go find some more hurricanes for me  hippies arent the only people who care about the environment  like i happen to care a lot  and so does our target joshua gray aka gandalf  his names gandalf and hes not a hippie  grays an exgreen beret and hes attacked nuclear power plants  hydroelectric dams wailing ships  wailing ships what hes against cleanburning lamp oil  would you relax  we know hes gonna try to attack the pipeline and we know where the pipeline is  yeah running through a couple hundred miles of marshy wetlands  so mobility will be key lana  and how will we achieve mobility huh  an airboat lana  just like burt reynolds in white lightning   great just  not to mention gator  which even though its the sequel i think is actually the stronger of the two films  just try to keep a low profile  we could scare off gray if we dont maintain the element of surprise  hey heres a surprise  this is herms  ooh and heres another one   remember jerry reeds character in gator  no  bama mccall  no  well whatever check this out i stuh  borrowed it from woodhouse  archer what the shit   right its just like in gator  gun gun  drop it drop it  you drop it  lana hijacking  dammit its not a  oh great there better be more of those  sky marshal drop your weapon   oh okay relax its okay were  dut dut dut dut dut  sterling archer and lana kane of isis and were on a mission to stop  an ecoterrorist from blowing up a gas pipeline  so for the love of god woman go make me a fresh batch of hurricanes  great  way to keep a low profile  thanks   this is the ampetco gas pipeline runs right underneath these  swamps supplyin almost twenty percent of americas liquid natural gas demand   right  but theres a pig launcher here  is that what it sounds like  its a pipe inspection gauge for cleaning the pipeline  its the only section above ground so if gray wants to attack our pipeline  hell have to do it there  so well set up a defensive perimeter at the launcher  and catch him when he tries  well wait hang on a second can i get the oyster  poboy and just like a side of crawfish touffee  cause im not sure if ill like it  archer  no just an entree okay  oh so the poboyhello   wow speaking of disastrous  speaking of shut up  think about what will happen to those fragile wetlands if that  pipeline explodes  screw the damn swamps think whatll happen to ampetcos profit margin   what  big money  huge tax credits from that hippie democrat congress  just for making a few simple changes around here  well a lot of these arent so simple  replacing all the lights with high efficiency fluorescents  putting lowflow fixtures on all the plumbing  recycling old batteries  exactly dont we do that already  umm   prrretty much  good  because im not leaving money on the table  so to get these freebie socialist tax credits we are going to make this place  lean and green  typical corporate bullshit thirty acres of wetlands disappear every day  but all you care about is how much natural gas you can pump out  hey were just supplying a demand  yeah ampetcos demand for huge profits  well some of those huge profits are paying isis to   protect that pipeline  which im only doing for the wetlands   wetlands profits whatever  yeah sounds like a winwin  just get out there and do your job  yeah i will  if you will excuse me  i should go with her  i dont think room service is coming  shoulda called first cause dats the only airboat  around for fifty miles and its reserved  what do you mean its reserved  is dat not selfexplanatory  look this is kind of an emergency   can we work something out  maybe  maybe use that money to buy a time machine  go back in time and be the first person  to reserve dat boat  you sure about that   yup  good  cause ive waited my entire life to say this exact phrase  im commandeering this airboat  sorry  it really is an emergency  of an awesome and asskicky nature  and some damn guard dog you is  annie annie  aw well thats just great  now both my dogs is dead  stupid efficient canadian lightbulbs  i can barely even see what im doing  what arya doin  i need six more of these  why do you need seven  one for each cat duh  for gods sake pam  have you no sense of decency  that bathrooms like a a war crime  dont blame me its those new lowflow toilets  with the old ones you could flush a dachsund puppy  i mean not that you would but well next time use the  dut dut dut dut  womens restroom  the what  thanks cyril  woooo seriously lana this must be what its like to have sex with me  how can an airboat be selfish  nope cant hear you im too happy  you cant hear me because youre redlining the engine  thank you certified airboat mechanic  now wheres the pig launcher thing  this heading one mile   but im serious if you dont slow down  ill keep feeling this  incredibly vibrant and alive  yeah right up until you blow the damn engine so  lana  i am not gonna blow  try clearing your throat about a jillion more times lana see if that helps  no  nothing  no no by all means let me do it  you just sit there like the african queen  the african queen was the boat   what no it wasnt it was audrey  katherine  whichever hepburn she was the queen  of africa  yeah  the white queen of africa  yeah back then hollywood was pretty weird about the whole race  thing like amos and andy were white a white guy played charlie chan   archer  pretty sure tonto was a jew  stop  what  gator   gator  talking  but i wish there was a gator  hey cmon not even as a joke   it so wasnt  look i said i was sorry  tell all this wildlife youre sorry when the pipeline  blows up because were not there to protect it  a all this wildlife can suck it  every thing out here either wants to eat me or give me malaria  and b  no thanks to you queen audrey  would you just  okay lets set up a defensive perimeter  yeah right after i set up the grill   dammit archer will you  hey i just dragged this  damn boat through a mile of my three biggest fears  so i think ive earned a kabob  well too bad  your lab uses more electricity than the rest of isis put together  yes and i need every single watt   no  but but i need  we all have to pitch in to make isis green  loot at me chopping ice for a tom collins  like a field hand   but  ooh or do i want a mint julep  but the slightest reduction of power to my lab  could put lives at risk  lives of what a few lab rats  also yes  yeah good great idea do the one thing that  could possibly make it hotter  ya gotta sear em first it locks in the flavor  and if youre hot and also somewhat bitchy drink a beer  i dont want a beer i want water  your funeral  god knows what kinda parasites are swimming around in it  not swamp water ass bottled   oh you are shitting me  i know right  a rainbow should shoot out every time you open it  you didnt bring any water  where would i have put it  great ill just wait half an hour for a cup of ice to melt   dut dut dut dutm dut  oww shit  what the  shit is this  no no no lana its dry ice  hurry put your hands in the swamp  rrrgh  how ya doin buddy  because dry ice is something crazy like negative a hundred degrees  i need you to not talk to me  i know and i know youre in a lot of pain so just try to relax  why are you still talk ow  and say hi to sister morphine  morphine  dammit i dont need that actually feels waaaay better   yeah  yeahhhh  that actually feels better  good then get up youre sitting on the beer  alright so wait a second  whatre your three biggest fears  nope   cmon  no hush im trying to fish  no dont shoot the fish  cmon this is a very fragile ecosystem  too fragile to spare one trout  no but or bass or whatever whats in here  nothing soon if people like you keep destroying the environment  wh its one lousy fish  one lousy black rhino one lousy bengal tiger  one lousy lorax  since when are you such a radical environmentalist  im not radical  well i mean not anymore  back in the day though  fur is murder  fur is murder  fur is murder  fur is murder  hows it feel to be a murderer  shall we find out  lady you dont scare me malory dear this is a fortyfour magnum   youre really not scared are you  newp  then how would you like a job  three weeks later i was in tunisia killing a different man  and how and why is that funny  not that i forgot about that afro  hey ya know what  i know you looked like angela davis had a lovechild  with sweet lou dunbar  shut up you shut up im trying to catch us some dinner   well if youd brought enough food  i wouldnt have had room   for beer and i since i cant catch beer  or a fish  yes i can  burt reynolds is my spiritguide  did you say mancrush  no im pretty sure it was shut up  whatre your three biggest fears  getting stuck on a boat with you three times  ooh here we go  cmere fishy fishy  and while you eat humble pie with a side of crow lana ill be dining on trout  waaaaagh  what the hell is that  what the hell does it look like  shoot it shoot it  archer oh so now its okay  what happened to your fragile ecosystem  screw the damn ecosystem shoot  you are such a hypocrite  i bet you probably eat veal  did you see that  and hear that what is that whats that sound  oh you are shitting me how did you shoot the boat  because i was bucking around like a rodeo clown in a barrel  well did you hit the gator  i dunno   i mean maybe  great so maybe hes wounded  no hes definitely wounded  oh right i forgot he has an arrow sticking out of his head  yeah i think thats what enraged him  and so now all twenty enraged feet of him is swimming around out there   in that inky black water  into which we are currently sinking  yeah its not ideal  i mean even if we had more shells you only brought two shells  no i brought shitloads thank you  well where are they  in the gear bags with your guns and everything else  still got the cooler though so  thank god for small miracles huh  lana lana  lanaaaa  what  i said thank god for small miracles  i heard you  i know  yeah why dontcha have another one  well somebodys got to   and since you refuse to help  you dont need help to get drunk  oh please it takes more than some threetwo or wow  six percent beer to get sterling archer drunk  six really  yeah so lay off  theres a giant wounded alligator out there not to mention a dangerous   ecoterrorist  holy shit totally forgot about him  i didnt but thats even more reason for you to get on board  with my new plan  is it as idiotic as your other plan  thats how brainstorming works lana   its freeform you come up with a lot of ideas  yeah like using the  pipeline to set the entire swamp on fire  which yes bad idea but it got me thinking about chemical reactions  like alcohols effect on the brain  no like the reaction between solid carbon dioxide  also known as dry ice of which we have plenty  and a fun sexy little molecule i like to call dihydrogen monoxide   water  water  combine them in a sealed container   and youve got yourself  some kind of dry ice bomb  arrgh yes ruiner of explanations  i was building to that but yes  well we got plenty of water  no the swamps too dirty  its full of whatever alligators shit out   which i can only assume its people  they dont eat people   they eat people all the time  they dont  last year sarasoni county florida chett willer age 16  swimming in the oak river canal  killed by an 11 footer  two years ago  county georgia  ruth baker age 39  killed in her back yard by a 10 footer  same year pinellas county florida walter jakes age 70 and his dog  killed by a 12footer   three years ago dade county  archer  what  what are your three biggest fears archer  alligators by far the biggest  and so youve memorized every fatal alligator attack  just in the us i cant find any information on tacks in china  they only live here and china  two different species  chinese alligators are smaller but their bellies are  fullyarmored so it kind of equals out and can we change the subject  okay whats your second biggest fear  god will ya just its crocodiles  wait do crocodiles even live here  not herehere but in the everglades  thats like a thousand miles away  well three years ago they caught a 9foot croc in the surf at  myrtle beach so ya know shit happens  wow  not sure i even wanna know what your thirdbiggest fear is   brain aneurysm  what  what does a brain aneurysm have to do with walking around in a swamp  nothing it can happen anywhere at any time  thats why its terrifying  oh my god okay okay so if the gatorpoop water is too dirty  yeah we need distilled water  does your plan include finding some  yes but  but what  youre not gonna like it  do we have to distill our pee  i guess you can if you want   but i was just gonna use this  there was bottled water  in there the whole time  yeah i just forgot  you forgot  thanks idiot  what you still wouldve burned your hands reaching in here idiot  i hope an alligator attacks you at the exact second  you have a brain aneurysm  how could you even say that  thats like me saying i hope you get cancer  what the hell is wrong with you  i obviously dont  but holy shit lana i pour my heart out and you just throw it right back in my face   sorry  well you should be  thats wait okay whats your biggest fear   newp  come on i told you mine  i know you lose   i think your biggest fear is intimacy  ha  when what you should be afraid of is falling in love  with me again because of my awesomeness  check this out  wait how do you light it  you dont the pressure just builds up until it explodes  how long does that take  depends on how much water you add were gonna need to dial it in  so you have no idea when thats gonna go off  how could i  aw shit   asshole  did it getcha   no  me neither   wow again small  dont   miracles  rrgh  how long was that  oh im sorry i forgot to time it  its okay i forgot to measure it  so were both gonna need to do better  every single one  to hell with the tax credits i want every last one of those  lowflow toilets out  dump them on the street with those ridiculous light bulbs  why do i have to carry the toilets  you know why  because of the things that come out of your body  oh shut up  mister bigmouth telling her we have a womens bathroom  where i better never catch you again  okay  jeez hostile work environment  yeah so everythings back to normal  is it  i told you lives were at risk  now behold the horror you have wrought  and pam if youre dumping stuff on the street  this can all go   what is it  shattered dreams  smells like rotten meat  also yes  yeah there we go  okay i think weve got the recipe figured out  yeah that was actually pretty great   duh  shut up  you shut up  okay ill get dry ice in the rest of the bottles  you be ready with the water and well wait for that big fat  stupid gator to come back  destroying his habitat isnt enough  what  i wouldve been here sooner but you stole my boat  do you not understand how reservations work or  reserve this treebeard  oh please its not even loaded   wh thanks lana  shut up   hi josh  hello lana  you know each other  josh was my environmental policy ta when i was in college  and her lover  also yes  wait i thought he was a green beret  i went to grad school on the gi bill  and thats when i realized i had to lead the fight against  the systematic rape of mother nature  but back then you just organized peaceful protests  like that day at the fur store where you disappeared without a trace  i guess i kinda found my calling  what as a hired gun for the military industrial complex  a traitor to the cause of environmental protection  me  what about you   always running around blowing shit up  threatening our supply   of lamp oil  shut up but josh seriously  do you really think the ends justify such violent means  yes  because this is a war  and victory will only come when americans will stop destroying the earth  just so they can drive  bigger cars build bigger houses and eat bigger food   so like never  yeah   oh my god thats depressing  sorry  and im also sorry we cant let you blow up this pipeline  i wasnt going to  well then why i mean i was but i saw you with this idiot  yelling on the plane about working for isis  so technically i saved the pipeline  yeah youre the best  archer whatever i win  suck it samwise   archer  so you need a lift back to land   yeah lemme just grab my cooler and  not you ass  lana maybe we can grab dinner see some dixieland jazz  that sounds lovely  oh cmon are you kidding me  youre really gonna leave me out here  yup  i like your new hairdo by the way  well if you like the collar youre gonna love the cuffs  well thats just great  she gets dinner and dixieland and laid and i get mosquitos and no beer  and not laid  how could this get any w  lemme finish worse  now okay see you ruined it  you ruined the moment
