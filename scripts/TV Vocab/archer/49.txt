                and so if i could direct your attention to these  visual aids you will see that from our  initial supply of 1000 kilos of cocaine we  hang on dummy we had a ton of cocaine  no we well we had a tonne tonne also known   as a metric ton but  metric   who uses metric  every single country on  the planet except for us liberia and burma   wow really  yup  cause you never think of those other two as   having their shit together  anyway as you can   see  why are they  thermometers  i thought they were cocks   wait theyre not  no they are   not cocks  okay jesus you people  next time remind me to get shot in the head  uh ron next time get shot in the head  sterling shut up cyril continue  so as you can see we are already down to 125  kilos of cocaine which was worth about 6 million so  and wait how much is that in pounds  forget pounds were doing kilos   no i meant pounds  sterling  exactly as in doctor who money  how do you stand there and crack wise when this   is all your fault  my fault  i only lost 44092 pounds of it mother  its pams fault we had to give the yakuza 100 kilos  and this other five spoiler alert she ate  yeah and would now be a good time to talk about pams   cocaine addiction  or the inspiring story  of her heroic struggle to finally triumph over it   what are you eating  yogurt  give me that   hey  lick it  well cant unhear that  holy shit yogurt is amazing why have i never tried yogurt  how have you never tried yogurt  mmm i didnt know it was that good  its good because its cocaine  oh my god and little kids eat it  cyril you said it

good place  shes going and thats final and  i swear to god if you send me to freakin rehab ill   go right to the cops  what   oh come on  you wouldnt dare  oh yeah just try  goddamn woodhouse  only thing for a grass mum  and sir im afraid your breakfast will be four minutes late  typical   what are you doing come on tighter  oh for the thats tight enough were not making   tit bondage porn  thats

krieger  right this place is like a habitrail  there are secret passages everywhere  i think thats why the colored maids never felt  safe theyd be polishing a spittoon  or whatever and suddenly

um never mind  archer i s  the last thing you need right now is a big  shiteating i told you so  but its exactly what you deserve  and krieger i hope you have a lot more where this came from   because  super  hunting women to force them to have surgery against their will  its for pams own good  shell die if she doesnt quit eating cocaine  and whos gonna die if you dont get rich managing   cheryls singing career  maybe you  now get out there and have some fun  how could we not  woodhouse i swear to god if you tell me lunch is four   minutes late  no sir  theres a mr holly here sorry an agent holly  from the fbi  but lunch is still a firm twelve  firm twelve  you know as in inches jesus 3048 meters  hi welcome to nazi canada  eh   why is the fbi here  did he show you a warrant  no sir he  then tell him to go piss off he cant come inside   without a warrant  he  well unless you invite him in  hes not a vampire idiot   if  plus its daytime  if invited in law enforcement can enter your home  without a warrant once inside under the doctrine  of plain view anything illegal say a truckload of  cocaine in the kitchen can be lawfully seized as evidence  they can also enter a private residence under any number of  exigent circumstances like providing emergency assistance  to an occupant say if they heard someone screaming   good morning  no sir good day  i insist that you leave immediately as you have entered   this residence unlawfully  uh you want to jump   in here yodas dad  i invited him in   woodhouse  and once you do that  you know we are in not unlike vampires   see  what  be that as it may why are you here  oh just checking in making sure you folks arent  engaging in treason espionage or anything else illegal  well i can assure you   like drugs  hmm   cocaine  nope   yakuza mmmm   shootout  noop  no one here was shot by the yakuza  well i think wed remember that  then whats his problem   vasectomy  piles   gout  mumps   goutmumps  progeria   hes just a little boy  but whatever is wrong   with him  goutmumps  is none of your business and since nothing in  plain view would lead a reasonable person to suspect  illegal activity i demand that you  nobody move   well  they can also   do whats known as a  protective sweep  case law regarding searchandseizure is actually   quite interesting  what about the  cocaine  admissible as evidence but only if he sees   it  so we have to  keep him out of the kitchen all right fan out  agent holly is the prime target but  so just so were clear you want us to   tranquilize a federal agent  do you have a better   idea  i do not  then we just slap some panties and rouge on him  pose him with gillette whose fault this is make some   glossy 8x10s  ill do it   i have a camera dibs  and then i doubt  well be hearing from agent holly in the future  or you could pose him with woodhouse   what  god  knows hes a little gilf   thats a thing  how do you not know   the different kinds of porn  because i have sex

archer  relax they dont send people that old to prison  it costs like two grand a day just to keep them alive   im talking about us  hmm i dont know  a hundred bucks depends who you ask lana  liberals

it back to myrtle beach  i probably wasnt going to anyway  turns out its actually not the best  and you actually have no right to search this house  as you can see theres nothing illegal going on  maybe not now but i know you still have a lot of  international contacts from your isis days  mexico colombia the orient i bet it wouldnt be too hard to   get set up in the drug trade  well   youd be surp oh  were not drug dealers   agent holly  good because ill be  watching you like a hawk thats been bred with an eagle  to produce some sort of eagleeyed superhawk with a  badge  so am i crazy or is he super weird  oh well im torn lana i really am  i want to say both but i also dont want you to stop my heart   again so  whos da widdle baby  whos da widdle baby whos da widdle baby   yes he is widdle little baby  wait the brain chip   is in there  i told you it was   small  said ripley to the   no doesnt work there  yeah its crap  okay i actually only have one brain chip so whos our   lucky winner  hmm i guess we have  to decide if we want regular lame cheryl and a pam whos not  gonna overdose on cocaine and die or potentially famous  country singer cheryl and a pam who tits   flip a coin  no  and yeah hes a weirdo but i think agent  hollys right we do have a lot of   international connections  so im thinking i  should take a trip down old mexico way maybe colombia or  even southeast asia or hey wheres ron   never heard of him  um  lana let it go jesus  but maybe we should try to sell out to an  international cartel but let me be clear  you wont be gallivanting around under the pretense of work just  to visit the fleshpots of the world   this isnt isis  no i  and it definitely isnt your semester abroad  what come on thats  hey i dont think we need to go into all the  cobra whiskey and ladyboys i mean   ha  shut up  you shut up and krieger  i trust the brainchip implant was a success  i think i mean its in there and shes alive  now we just have to see if t were any adverse side effects  uh cheryl  nah cheryls gone  im cherlene now and if somebody dont fry me six  goddamn eggs and some carolina fries i would personally be  shocked shocked i tell you if
