clippings yeah  its pretty hard to stay anonymous when youre the  worlds greatest secret agent  calling yourself that cant help  hang on true story operation cia  that movies basically why i became a secret agent in the first place  really  that movie was just godawful  whats awful is i almost punched you  no you didnt  and ive seen all your other movies like five times  sam whiskey navajo joe

listen i kinda have a date  no no no wait wait wait  sorry lemme buy you a drink i wanna tell you my idea for a gator sequel  gator was a sequel  i know and this will be the final chapter in the mcclusky trilogy  trilogy huh  with twice as many airboats as gator  twice as many would be none  whatre you talking about gator had speedboats  not airboats  really are you sure  pretty sure  i directed it  i  okay but this one has airboats and theyre central to the plot  and it sounds great kid but like i said   i kinda have a date so  i get it  you gonna take her upstairs and give her the longest yard  yoohooooo  mother  what are you doing here  what are you doing here   im kicking it with  burt oh no  yeah so  remember how i said i kinda had a date  its kinda with your mom  hope thats not gonna be a problem   oh please  burt reynolds didnt give you a black eye the floor did  when you fainted like a schoolgirl  it was an involuntary reaction mother  to seeing you all tarted up to meet my hero in a hotel bar for sex  oh for  we were meeting for drinks  i mean obviously sex was implied but ugh  and since when is he your hero  wh since always  eeeast bound and doowwn  i thought that was richard petty  which doesnt even merit a response  and you cannot date burt reynolds  can am and will continue to do so  im serious ill do something drastic  you will not  mainly because youve got bigger things to worry about  ill be the judge of  a cuban hit squad is in new york to kill me  apparently  this intels a week old  why are you just telling me about it now   because pick up sterling pick up pick  mmyello  sterling dear its me  theres a  ha voicemail  you know what to do  oh for gods sake  hello  sterling dear its me  hold on hold on  hang on  sterling  dont hang up  hello  sterling its  elaborate voicemail hoax  leave it  and then i just sort of forgot about it because  that same night i met  burt reynoooolds  is on line oooone  for you for some reason  burt dear what a lovely surprise  im sitting here with just a mustache  and memories of last night   oh burt  rrrgh  and also a blanket  the ac in my rooms stuck on freeze  deliverance gator and this is him in cosmoooh  how totally hot is he  i swear to god you could drown a toddler in my panties right now  i mean not that you would but  hey  shut up  youre not my supervisor  wait who is my supervis carol  oh right  go get my gray fox out of cold storage  burt reynolds is taking me to a movie premiere tonight so  help me god  if you throw that computer on the floor again youll wake up  in a mental ward with total amnesia under someone elses name  thats actually kinda scary  eh  wouldnt be the first time  archer hey about this expense report not now cyril  mother is ruining what remains of my life before a cuban hit  squad assassinates me so  matalo  wh  yeah laugh it up lana  i am  you almost got shot in the face  get off  you get off  cyril  im pretty tense right now  because of the cubans  or because burt reynolds is doing your mom  yeah laugh it up  i am  burt reynolds is actually banging  archer  you broke my frickin nose   whats that  sorry i cant hear you over the sound  of i broke your nose  bullying cyril isnt gonna make burt reynolds stop shtupping your mom  hes not doing that  but even if he is which he is  no he isnt  this cuban hit squad is no joke  so if i were you id lay low in the safehouse for a few days  until we work out a plan to neutralize them  ohh yeah okay  the safehouse  im sorry your words made sense but your sarcastic tone did not  because there are no cubans  mother just wants me out of the way so she can do unspeakable things with  burt reynolds  so nice try idiot   i love it that im the idiot  so unless the building  is literally on fire none of you are to call me  because as i may have mentioned fifty times   tonight i will be attending a movie premiere with burt reynolds  oh my god that totally reminds me  this came for you  from him  and you opened it  thats how i knew it was from him  give me that  dear malory its been   dear malory its been real but im dumping you for a young  starlet and heading back to tinseltown  do not contact me  regards burt reynolds  regards  they werent even warmest  wait a  who calls it tinseltown  carol channing  or somebody who just thinks thats what movie stars call hollywood  stockard channing  archer  his mother dating his mancrush  i bet archer kidnapped him  but how   archer goes to burts hotel room  knocks him out  archer  knocks out burt reynolds   with gas  oh shit  and then hides him somewhere  like an idiot kid hiding a lamp he broke  you really think hed do that  yes really  im serious if you ever go near to my mother again i will  do something really bad  well then you should probably just  go ahead and get it over with  dont worry i  wait what  because if you dont kill me and i get loose  youre gonna wish you were in hell with your back broke  i dont have a response to that  they never do  its my own fault i shouldve known  they tell you they love you and then they just cast you  aside when some young starlet catches their eye with her perky little boobs  i bet they were perky and big  jeezow  why are you torturing her like that  why are you asking rhetorical questions   aww thats actually kinda sad  alright heres the plan  i say we go rescue burt reynolds and as a bonus beat some sense into archers  head and ass  yeah  right in the head and ass  so pam carol stay here with malory  everybody else lets go to archers  hes got a cuban hit squad after him  why wouldnt he go to the safehouse  a because he thinks theyre imaginary and b  the safehouse doesnt have a  new hot tub  fifty jets handhewn california redwood no big deal  the california redwood is endangered  so  i already got my tub  woodhouse burt reynolds  burt woodhouse  hi  loved you in gone with the wind  not him shut up get him a drink  whats your poison  pimms cup  odd choice well this whole things pretty odd  whats odd  is you wanting to date my mother  whys that odd  because youre you   and shes um   beautiful smart funny successful  like one of those tops  not to mention dropdead sexy  oh dear god yes  woodhouse  i shall fetch a cucumber  you have to not date my mother  cant do it  cant or  wont whatever pick one  well then heres whats gonna happen   youre gonna drink your pimms cup  which is exciting  never had one  then im gonna knock you out and youre gonna wake up in a  mental hospital with total amnesia under someone elses name  hey now theres an idea for a movie  yeah i think it already was  i wasnt in it  well maybe not but fade in  a mental ward  white walls white sheets nurses in crisp white uniforms  broken men shuffle like zombies we see a hospital wristband on  a mans arm john doe  and we slowly tilt up to see the mans face gator mcklusky  and hes looking out the window the afternoon sun on his face  and theres a spark of recognition in his eyes cause you know what  hes looking at   no  the okefenokee swamp  theres a mental hospital there  right on the water  and guess whats tied up right out there at the dock  an airboat  and the head nurse falls in love with him and finds out who  he really is so she helps him escape and they get chased by a  bunch of dirty cops but in the end they win  and you just got a screenplay credit  for real  oh yeah maybe even your pimms cup sir  doesnt it come in a silver chalice  ah  that would be a pimp cup sir   ohh  i hate to sound hollywood  but could you put my pimms cup in a pimp cup certainly  it would be an honor mr gable  maybe even what  executive producer  executive producer  but im not falling for that  you big liar  youre not gonna make that movie  oh i absolutely am  and once your isis buddies find out that you kidnapped me and come find me  im gonna give them all an ep credit  no youre not  so drink your stupid pimms cup  yeah  where are we on that chalice  because nobody is coming for you burt  and especially nobody from isis  okay dont take this the wrong way  but im kinda wondering how youre gonna be an effective field agent  interesting  coming from a woman
