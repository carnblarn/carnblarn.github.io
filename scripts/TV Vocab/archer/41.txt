agency  miss spy on people  what i only watched for a second  you need medication pam pills  big pills like they use at the zoo  but we have to go now the vet comes back from lunch in twenty  minutes  lets go bitches tiger tranqs  we are not breaking into the zoo  to steal tiger tranquilizers  cyril they have all kinds  and i have to directdeposit the annual bonuses so if you two  could go be crazy and horrible elsewhere  like the tuntmore towers hotel where lanas shacked up with mr   archer  wait what  yeah we can see if hes into all that freaky genderreversal stuff  that  wait what  cyril i

not swingin by the zoo  laaaaame  whats lame archer  the fact that were up against at least four highlytrained north korean  agents or the fact theyve all got peppercorns lana  well i was gonna say tokarevs and shpagin41 submachine guns but yeah  lets go with peppercorns  thank you  because without peppercorns its not steak au poivre  it cant be by like definition  archer were supposed to be stopping the north koreans  from buying part of a nuclear bomb not ordering every single item on the  room service menu  just the dinner menu   pounding two three hundred dollar bottles of  glengoolie frickin blue  two i ordered three   then passing out on the bed totally naked  for a  whatd you call it  power blackout and youre welcome  yeah thanks the memory of your bare ass will bring  me comfort and warmth during the coming nuclear winter  relax its north korea the nationstate equivalent of the shortbus  nice  whats nice is this hot tub which get in before you blow our cover  any more than you already have by not performing your wifely duties  excuse me  you said my card was used at the tuntmore towers hotel this morning  hm oh yes i remember now yes yes its all fine mmmmmkaybyebye  i am literally going to kill him  well figurative  literally ill lure him to my condo  in miami drug his steak au poivre drive him out to the everglades  slather him with rancid chicken fat and then toss him to the gators   pretty specific for a hypothetical  oh he is going to pay  for this  literally  cyril cyril  ugh fine then ill do it  are they doin it  are they bangin  no pam they are not bangin  well these ribs sure as hell are  oh my god right  we should take some to the tigers  and miss these two doin it   oh my god right  will you hags stop it look  theres nothing going on over there  unless shes screaming at him to get it up  shes not  thats what she was screamin at you  okay so i watched the whole thing  ugh were you raised in a barn  no i just slept out there a lot  sooo you got an eta on when you might possibly be ready to help   hard to say really  chis taking her sweet time here  not criticizing thorough is good  look just gimme ten  twenty minutes and  archer i dont know how  long the north koreans will be out of their room so while you ladies discuss  the pros and cons of a clear coat  you say that like there are cons  ill go be thorough at my job and plant the geiger counter so we know  if and when the uranium shows up  do you even know if that thing works  well pigley three that would certainly explain the glowing  and probably a few other things  grunt  why do you let him push your buttons  why not push his buttons because he has no buttons hes buttonless  the only way to make him as crazy as he makes you is to ha ha ha haaaa  seriously who are you van cliburn  knock off the tickling and work that shit  yeah right a baby could  unghh  im sorry miss tunt did that hurt   yesss  cyril they bangin yet  wh no actually archers alone lanas either in the bathroom or  oh my god what  the hell is this bullshit  what you say you want clear coat  yeah why not i mean its not like  it hasnt crossed your mind and youre not getting any younger so   lanaaa  jesus what is it the koreans  only if theyre who screwed me out of my bonus  which would be weird  your bonus  if you could even call it that  whats yours is it shitty go online and check your bank account  now when im suction cupped on a window  thirty stories above the ground  yeah you should have five bars  okay so its gonna sound like im hanging up but   lana lana  holy shit i think shes gone rogue  but whoa dont pack up my toes arent gonna do themselves  and even if youre not necessarily doing it for the right  reasons hes  archer  hey hey  phone gimme  did you seriously climb all the way up here just to see what my bonus is  no i sarcastically climbed all the way up here to see what your bonus  is he said sarcastically  phone  okay jesus keep your voice whoa  sucks right i mean thats not even  remotely fair what the  shit  apparently were in a crazy parallel universe where bonuses are  based on merit instead of whether or not you crawled out of your  mother  lanaaa  archerrrrr  im comiiiiing  phrasingboom  lanaaaa  aaaaaaaaagh wh  woooohoohoohooooo ungh   oh my god archer that was  a ninetydollar  manicure i know  and i couldnt care less but chi lana she worked really hard on it  oh man they gotta bump uglies now  they  wait what  cyril a neardeath experience is like the ultimate aphrodisiac  penultimate the ultimates doing it on top  of a tranqed up tiger   so listen  no you listen and then shut up   you shut up i was on the verge of  dying  making a  stain on the sidewalk  decision so  so since were keeping  score for bonus purposes lana  in addition to saving your life a gazillion times   since i started working at isis ive  been shot stabbed set on fire poisoned shot sexually assaulted  partially chewed shot and declared legally dead twice on the same day  you said shot like three times  thats just by you  total its more like holy shit nineteen and now you get your bonus and mine  archer i didnt  do anything to deserve it exactly  and again excuse me  there is no excuse for you  alrighty think i made my decision  and it is final  because i borrowed your credit card  you didnt borrow it you stole it  little column a little column  be advised that until   i say otherwise mister stickyfingers  seriously does this  never dry  lana is now agentincommand  wait what  yeah hang on youre breaking up  so my first command as

no obviously it hurts getting tom dempseyd in   the tits like that  archer  but i meant watching me save your ass for the  gazillion and oneth time  archer  shes in command  oh okay so i guess you think this is my fault  you guess  well im not a mindreader lana  silence  we deal with you soon enough  and by deal with obviously he means  shoot  i mean i assume and negativity is infectious by the way youre the  agentincommand lana you should be focused on keeping my morale   hi excuse me could you go ahead and shoot one or both of us now  also a good leader is never sarcastic  oh we dont shoot you after mission  finish we take you back to glorious democratic peoples republic of korea  oh then do go ahead and shoot us  archer  what lana its none of those things  not democratic not a republic and definitely not glorious jesus   watch frontline once in your life  this isis camera yes   uh  yes and as all north koreans know  cameras steal your soul so  it is your  indians who think that  wow

to my board of directors  i dont at all  do you even know what that is  i dont at all  i just cant seem to find the humor in what should  have been a simple mission turning into a total farce  it wasnt  lana it was by definition a farce  capped off by the fact that no one thought to stick  around and catch the madman  selling the uranium  lana was in command  yes was  lucky for the madman  whoever he was  aww maaaan  well there goes my master plan  yeah get in there eat em up  god knows you earned it
