well ill tell you what its not which is um what it looks like  i got caught on the fence then mr archer tried to get me loose and   you better git yer ass in that house  do you wanna have sex with my wife  no i swear this was just an extremely unlikely mishap with the barbed wire  cause we would be amenable to that well  why you look so nonplussed  because i wasnt sure if you knew what amenable actually meant  until you followed it up with nonplussed  see me and janelle got us one of them open marriages  like in france  oh right in europe  and i would really like that open marriage to include rays new wife  what   now look thats in the bible  really   genesis thirtyeight verse eight  really  but even though ray used to be a preacher he was never  big on the old testament  i could see that  so i doubt hed wanna reciprocate  so i just need you to keep him busy while i have sex with his wife  and then i get to have sex with my wife you son of a bitch  yeah i think i got  so where the hells your damn pants  theyre on the fence  goddammit archer  wait hang on  archer shut up  ray he was  and poor janelle was  i gotta go make sure shes okay  and you better have a talk with him  i will randy im sorry  a good long talk  like talk for about forty fortyfive minutes  okay so  stop  i have never in my entire life been as disgusted as i am at this moment   well give it a minute  what do you mean a cyberattack  apparently the uders downloaded a virus into the mainframe  so this all needs to come out  the mainframe is like kriegers baby  howd you get him to go in on this  i told him id get pam to fight in his ultimate bum shockfights  is it called that because paying homeless men to fight is shocking  noop  well hello there gamechanger  he what  yeah apparently its in the bible  no it isnt  it did sound too cool for the bible  but why do you care  a youre gay and b you and carol arent really married  but randy thinks we are  yeah but  thats actually a really good point  im gonna beat him like a rented mule  now that sounds like something from the bible   she in there  yeah wheres mine at  upn the woods with ray  you gotta wait til later maybe after supper  remember no kissing  i was  that is the wierdest rule  i know right  some honeymoon  oh hey do i do the face  and where the hell is sterling when i need him  youve reached sterling archers voicemail  please leave a message  wh finally a nonidiotic greeting  sterling i want an update so call me the instant you get this mess    the voice mailbox of  sterling archer  is full goodbye  idiot  cmere you skinnylegged sumbitch  oh sorry  thats okay theyre not my best feature  no i was  not important  what is important is that randy gave me a bible lesson  yeah  and whatd the bible say  well janelle obviously the actual scripture  is open to interpretation but what i took away from it  is that we should go in the barn and screw our brains out on a  huge pile of marijuana  it didnt say nothin about a rubber did it  it did not  rays still up in the woods right  uh oh  no he actually said he wanted to talk to  randy  whoa whoa whoa now hang on a second  you wifeswappin white trash piece of  ray no  randy  yes randy  which i probably shouldve mentioned earlier  dont judge me  food  you lucky i didnt kill you  youre lucky i didnt kill you  while you were in bed with my wife  our marriage was never consummated   and i think we all know why  stop  carol look theres plenty of blame to go around here  i mean i dont think i deserve any but you were gonna screw her  yeah so is that still on or  wh  carol wh  well somebody cmon promises were made  just like you promised maman deddy youd always take care of me  and here we go  but they werent even cold in the ground before you  were galivantin around europe  it was the olympics  which you lost  bronze medal is not losing  and then it was off to new york city  you can just say new york  to be a hoitytoity interior decorator  you can just say decorator  whatever i dont know why i thought he could help save my farm  because your job  thats a job for sissies  oh yeah  well guess what  ray  is not an interior decorator  i  no ya know what  yes shut up  randy your seemingly effeminate brother is actually a  highlytrained secret agent  pshh  yeah and im something equally hard to believe is true  it is true thats why i married him  well and the bronze medal  prove it  what do you want a business card  where do you think he got a duffel bag full of assault weapons   well yall do live in new york city  just new york  ray is he tellin the truth  mostly  so cause youre a spy is that why you never come back to visit  mostly  and here all this time i thought it was cause you were ashamed of us  oh cmon now why would you think that  i found a buncha your old diaries  well obviously not the one with the miss piggy on it  no deddy said he burned that one   ugh great  and im sorry i screwed your wife  and im sorry if i ever made you feel like i was ashamed of you  the important thing is you came back to help me  cmon thats what familys all ab    dukes  shit  dammit  randy gillet  this is sheriff ez ponder  you come out there with your hands up  that sonuvabitch is early  i dunno sundown  sounds more colloquial than like an actual  well if you wanna back  out on me nows probly the time to do that  randy you may be a racist homophobic wifeswapping drug dealer   farmer   but nobody murders my brother  the gillet boys side by side  janelle cover that winder yonder  archer you got a little fight in ya  yeah im pretty furious about not getting to bang janelle  plus i wanna unleash the power of moonshine  then grab a gun and cover that winder  what should i do  i got some red hot pokers layin in that fire  if anybody gets hit you grab one and slap iron to it   awesome  and remember its us or them  so this is how its gonna be huh  randy i didnt want it like this  cmon i tried to reason with ya  reason with

much  thats a thing  looks like its just you and me brother  randy you dont have to do this  theyll go easy on you  hell the judge is my wifes cousin  i bet hell give you probation  oh please  youre gonna murder him so you can take over his dope farm  what  cease fire  hold your fire  why in the world would you think that i a peace officer  sworn to uphold the law would wanna murder your brother  to get his marijuana farm  i  because thats what randy said   randys a drug dealer  farmer  and i tried to get him to quit  i come to him as a friend i come to him as an elder of the church  but he wouldnt give it up  and so now i gotta come to him as the law  and you accuse me of plannin a murder  well you did used to pick on me a bunch  well im sorry i was a dick in high school  but you gotta admit you were extremely pickonable  theres nothing wrong with capezios  randy is he telling the truth   mostly  randy  you almost got me and my friends killed  because you could never be bothered to get a real job  well i only got to ninth grade  how the hell else was i supposed to earn a livin diggin seng  there is a perfectly good coal mine not a halfmile from here  and maybe you wouldnt get rich but at least its an honest living  yeah but its hard  sos this   randy  shut up  and mama never liked you  easy dont shoot  im comin out  phrasing  heres the files you had me pull  oww  what the hell is on your hands  my bumzappers  for the shockfights  th im doing for krieger which is why he broke the server to help lana cover  up that ray and mr archer are killing cops for a drug dealer and

lyinass bitch  shes mad because i slept with randy  to get food for my fellow hostages  so you really think you can fix it so i just get probation  oh god no i just said that  all these drugs and weapons attempted murder of police officers  youll probably die in prison  oh will you come visit me  probably not  cause youre a spy and all  uh  hes a highlytrained secret agent  is that right  well listen here if you ever find your way back up in the holler  gimme a call  i think i got myself an extra pair of capezios layin  around somewheres  uh  ok  should i just 911  aight lets move em out
