can solve your ant problem  first of all its doctor i can solve your ant problem  and second of all heres your refund  i really thought that would work  what were you going for antstrength relative to the size of a human  shut up  everyone shut up because item six  talk to pam today because somehow and seemingly impossibly soon it is  once again time for peer reviews  yaaayyyy  ugh how can you not hate those  i dunno maybe im the only one who cares about this being  an efficient and supportive work environment  maybe youre lame  maybe you can shut your dickholster  so see me after ive got everyone paired off  well except ms archer  wait why dont you have to do it  well i would if i had a peer in this entire building  item seven  oh  you all remember lucas troy   shitbag  whatre you talking about lukes awesome  hes a kickass agent a great wingman he can drink ireland under the table  back when we were training together we tore it up  just like his isis contract  i trained him for a year and the minute hes worth a damn he  goes to work for odin  she said oversimplifyingly  wh  and so congratulations to all our new agents but especially to our  highestscoring recruit lucas troy  way to go luke  im going to work for odin  he was still awesome  and my best   only   shut up my best  friend mother which is why you hated him because you were  jealous of our relationship   so you two were in a relationship wh  no not the ray kind  meaning  homosexual ray  so so obviously  whats not obvious mother is why my best friend the awesome luke troy  is on your stupid agenda  oh right lets see here doo doo doo dooo oh  hes dead  hes what  dead  jesus clean the secretly gay for lucas troy out of your ears   this is crazy how could luke be    gay  dead lana  and your little whatever gay innuendos dont even merit a   reacharound  owww jesus  ha ha  its just like my birthday party all over again  remember  nooo  yeah  because you werent invited  mother tell me exactly what happened  to lure a black market arms dealer into the open  troy was posing as a nuclear scientist who had stolen enough  uranium for a dirty bomb  oh that is classic luke the spook  hey stupid heres your fake uranium click handcuffs drops mic on stage  yes that was the plan  but somehow thanks to what i just assume is odin idiocy  troy acquired real uranium  even classicer  the bad guys would obviously bring a geiger counter  and ten million dollars in bearer bonds  and when the smoke had cleared four odin agents were dead and  the uranium the bad guys and the money had all disappeared  and so had troy  doesnt prove anything  oh for  archer if it walks like a duck and quacks  like a duck and murders a bunch of its fellow ducks  then maybe the duck knew there was a mole  ever think of that  that maybe theres a fox in the henhouse  a wolf in sheeps clothing  or one of the other tricky animals  well well never know  the plane he escaped in crashed in vermont  what no i bet he faked his own death so he can expose the mole  there is no mole and faked it how  paging dr cooper  dr db cooper  lana he obviously bailed out and  and then  landed safely buried his chute ran ten miles to the  crash site and then strapped himself into the stillburning wreckage  that that could be anybody  well anybody with his dental records  what  yes sterling im  actually no im not sorry  he was a traitor and a thief and so im glad hes dead  if he is  because youve always been insanely jealous of my friends  so if youll excuse me mother i have to go clear  the name of an american hero  does he seem almost a little too fond of troy  yeah and you know he was gay right  as a tangerine  in jean shorts  but i thought troy was already dead  because he wants you to think that  but i have a list of all his known aliases so see if any of  them used a passport  oh or a credit card  yeah like at roughtrade dot net  lana i will hire kenny loggins to come here and  play an acoustic set while i slap some sense into you  pff  ray back me up here  luke troy yes or no gayest dude ever  uh  dude what it was just the tip  meathead fratboy asshole jock maybe but no definitely not gay  what  boom  sorry  what  what  i knew it  where is he  and why dont we leave the terrace door open woodhouse  exactly because hes a frickin lemur  ray call me when you find a lead  ill be somewhere in or on top of my building shooting tranquilizer darts at  the worlds shittiest pet  told him when he bought it  and im telling you these reviews are mandatory and   since i outrank you  hang on lemme check this  imaginary list of all the people i report to doo doo doo doo dooooo  okay  what the hell is this  this mustache on a penis is rodney  and since theres only one name on this list you must be ms archer  cleverly disguised as a large man  mehheh  hes the new whatever gun librarian  armory supervisor  hooray whats with the cage  oh some wacky new thing the kids are doing called inventory control  ms archers pissed cause a buncha guns and stuff keep going missing  oh and lemme know if you want a good deal on a  gallon of irradiated ants  well whatever  i need some range time so just scuttle back into the tiny  little domain over which you have power and get me a  thousand rounds of nine mil wadcutter  absolutely  just fill out these requisition forms in triplicate  wh  for a few lousy bullets  well one theyre excellent bullets are you gonna stand there  in what i just assume are twoinch lifts and tell me  archer filled out your stupid forms just to get a tranquilizer gun  no i am not  well  he filled them out to get doo doo dooooo two hk mpfive  two thousand rounds ammunition for same twenty marktwo  fragmentation grenade  wait a minute  yeah that lemur is hosed  fourteen days survival ration two night vision goggle  two each arctic camouflage parka and pant and doo doo doo doooo  two pairs snowshoe  son of a bitch  that phone call was  loooooooooooooooke  dude i knew you faked your death because a mole framed you  for stealing that uranium  dude that is such a relief i was worried they turned you against me  are you kidding  dude bros before apparent threats to national security  archer you sure youre up for this  because this thing it runs deep  dude i love deep said your mom  haa  classic you  allright gps says ill be there in four hours  dont worry luke im coming for you  what was that  phrasing  nice  queer  wait a  oh my god holy shit  no vermont has liquor stores  right  yeah they have to it sucks there  cyril not now  whats the signal strength on archers cellphone  the doohickey says hes about thirty minutes away  and my point was we couldve easily done it by now  and my point is that pursuing a dangerous rogue  agent isnt the optimal time to do peer reviews  coulda done it ten times by now  god damn it fine frickin review me  section one team dynamics  question one does employee cooperate with  oh these are all strongly disagree  you  pussy  shut up it went down wrong  said your oh  yeah doesnt work there  mmmmokay say thanks for coming  nooope  no seriously if anybody finds out i helped you ill be disavowed  i know  dude i know  thank you  for  nope  god what a dick  said your mom  boom  dammit  so easy  okay i got an el camino  full of rampage here  so whats the plan  right yes okay so i know it doesnt look like much now  but it has tons of potential  as a base of operations while we track down the mole who framed  you for murdering your colleagues and selling uranium on the black market  no asshole  as a bedandbreakfast   uhh  twin oaks  you like that  for the name  twin oaks  seriously  yeah according to the doohickey it says archers in that direction   are you reading it wrong  within two hundred meters  i bet youre reading it wrong  section two interpersonal  does employee frequently criticize oth   strongly agree  somewhat disagree  somewhat shut up  come on were going on foot through the woods  ive got a bad feeling about this  i know but imagine it all fixed up  no yeah i mean obviously its  its gonna be amazing  dude look at these floors  thats heart of pine  yeah so look  look at this mantelpiece  mahogany  theres another seven  eight fireplaces dude how nuts is that   pretty nuts  said your mom  yeahhh so um about unframing you for treason and murder  yeah i dunno man it kinda seems like whats the point you know  i dont actually  cmon theres too much evidence   i mean its all fake obviously but  exactly  dude theres a mole in your agency  we gotta catch him  but then what  then theres another mole or a double agent on and on its  all just secrets and lies man  yeah its espionage  i cant go back to that world man im too tired  hopefully thats just neurological damage from scraping lead paint  no its   because turning  the munsters house into a bb  is an insane response to your situation  itd be cheaper to build a brand new house out of actual money  yeah i know itll cost a fortune to fix her up  but moneys not a problem  why wait why is money not a problem  and my situation is anyone who could hurt me thinks im already dead  i  wait and who was in the plane  hm  i said who was in the goddamn no no no no what the hell  how could you not see that  because i only have two eyes and they were busy looking for hunters  why is it pumpkin season  is that a thing  archer were you followed

archer i thought i had no yeah you did  but then you came back to me  dont take this the wrong way  but im getting an extremely gay vibe  wh  jesus dude im not gay  i  for other men  lost me again  i cant really explain it  i mean you know me ive banged more hot chicks than ive  had hot dinners but theres just something about you  that makes you gay for me  well i dont really like that word  well sorry i didnt invent english  its more like a singular samesex attraction   can i um my heads kinda spinning  i know this is a lot to process  no literally  well figuratively   if it was literally  the wineyou drugged the wine  yeah sorry i thought you might freak out when i told you all this   pfff sunnersannable id do me  and also when i told you i  actually did steal the uranium and murder my fellow agents   you dick  to fund our life together dude  which will start right after i go murder your fellow agents  way way way way hang on  you had same wine how you not get drug  coated the inside of the glass  heh  classic you  well this is a frickin disaster  i know  when ron said we were going on a cruise i almost vomited blood  no nobodys doing their peer reviews  pam the word disaster  implies its something that actually matters  it matters to me  well but you dont  well then maybe instead of doing my job ill go hang out  in vermont with luke troy and all the other assholes  what  oops  trace sterlings phone and scramble every available field agent  i want them all converging on his location   they kinda already are  theres only like  two of em  so why are these damn peer reviews so hard  only like ten people work in this whole goddamn chickenshit outfit  sorry  dont be  it is a chickenshit outfit  look for your information  blaze orange is the safest color to wear to avoid being accidentally shot at  what about intentionally shot at   oh man this is almost too easy  oh for  seriously  yeah gotta give em a head start  one sterling archer two sterling archer ooh sterling archertroy  we can take each others names  id be  luuuuke  cmon youre not thinking straight  a you wildly underestimated my livers ability to metabolize toxins  and b why would you possibly have these  because im not the idiot who took his idiot clothes off  just your jacket cmon im freezing  no  i am gonna give you the worst peer review in the history of them  hey lana  wheres archer  did you kill him  hes fine  unlike your aim  guess you never learned how to shoot huh  what  first of all  shitass  or take criticism  strongly agree  and from where  under  wear  what was it we used to call you  truckasaurus  cyril  no it was oh yeah sprayandpray  dammit  we also called you shirley temper  uh cyril  which ya know lame  but accurate  again unlike your aim  which is why i always thought it was weird that you only ever  carried two magazines  section three organization skills  cyril  employee is often unprepared for important meetings  strongly agree  you left your gun in a pile of clothes  because i had nowhere to put it  and yet you found room for a twentypage wad of pams stupid peer review  its important to her  okay so dont really know what to make of that  unless wait no get it out of your head  predator only hunts in tropical jungles  i assume  and desperately hope  dammit  well  have you found sterling  well his phones in this house  its about twenty miles north of bennington so i assume its a bb  well you would know  and if you want to keep those teeth missy you wont suck them at me   you know  shut up have you tried calling him  ha ha haa leave

entmoot  oh my god what if im gay for tolkien  dude  seriously not that its gonna matter in thirty seconds  but what is your problem   well besides lana ditching me  for what an entmoot  ya know cause
