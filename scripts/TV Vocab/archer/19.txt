kinda curious why do you even work at isis  cherylcarol why do you  lana i because im not worth a billion dollars  cherylcarol yeah me neither  i have to split it with my stupid brother cecil  malory and how much will you be splitting  cherylcarol it actually is a billion dollars  lana i am literally wet with jealousy  cherylcarol jealous of what  being scared of kidnappers the rest of my life  it

is fine pam who taught ya how to punch  yer husband  you better just  kill me  malory and second of all no one is going to kidnap you on my watch  you may consider isis your personal bodyguard  for you know a modest retainer  lana ah malory still shut up  cherylcarol but oh my god what about pam  archer i dunno about pam and i know even less about ocelots  but my gut tells me you gotta get some tree branches or a  tire swing or something in there because he is desperate for stuff to play with  whatre we doing  malory were taking cheryl back to isis and locking it down  until we catch those dastardly kidnappers  because were all she has now  archer okay but on the way we gotta stop at a toy store and at least get him  a stuffed animal  something  its like meowschwitz in there  popeye hmhmm  cyril half a billion with a b  lana followed by an illion  cyril well that little she owes me thirtyseven hundred dollars  lana for what  cyril what nothing whatre we doing  lana locking down isis  because once the kidnappers realize theyve got the wrong idiot  theyll probably come back for the right one  so here all hands on deck  cool  safetys off barn  trust me dear this vault is the safest place  in the entire building  cherylcarol but wait how much are you gonna charge for isis to protect me  malory well thats based on my expenses  plus an administrative fee a small contingency
