 when i get confirmed im gonna be a man  so how come i cant drive  you really want to get into this  who was that man that we had to pick up at camp last year  for bed wetting  that was the year before last  you could have killed those girls  that wouldve been interesting  what  what did you just say  death just shows the ultimate absurdity of life  what is this  are you trying to get me to lose my temper  cause im about to put yo u through that goddamn window  see thats what i mean  life is absurd  dont say that  god forgive you  there is no god  hey hey  where is this coming from  they teach you this crap at school  is this this new english teacher mr clark  where is he from  answer me  oberlin  want him to read something other than hustler  hello he got assigned the stranger  you want him to be an educated person  what do you think education is you just make more money  this is education  do you ever think like why were we born  madame de stael said  in life one must choose before boredom and suffering  go to your room  no im serious  why were we born  we were born because of adam and eve thats why  now go upstairs and do your math  algebra thats the most boring  your other choice is suffering  you want t o start now  move your ass  jesus christ let me think  you wake me up my heads all cobwebs  wyczchuk wyczchuk  waldemar wyczchuk  you had lobster fra diavolo with him in atlantic city  on the 14th of this month  he got blown up  fuck  were not necessarily trying to pin this on soprano  or anybody in your crew sal  were drawing no conclusions  but what do you got for me  if i had some coffee  cut the the quips  tell me about the merger talks  what do you want me to say  philadelphias been putting pressure on the shy business  thats been going on since moses wore short pants  tonys still resisting the philly overtures  sometimes puss you dont act like a guy  thats facing 30 to life for selling h  dont get heavy with me  you come to my house because somebodys leaning on your ass  you come to my house  you know what this looks like  im doing all i can to help you guys  one time tony bought a pool table from wyczchuk  so hes sitting there and he asks me  if theres no god why was i born  he tells me hes got no purpose  howd you answer him  i told him it cost about 150 grand to bring him up so far  so if hes got no purpose i want a fucking refund  are you angry with anthony jr about the car  you cant put shit back on the donkey  boys will be boys  its this other crap thats not normal  adolescent angst is very normal  you never went through it  you think my mother and father are gonna stand for that shit  how is your mother  shes dead to me  and hows anthony jr been taking it  what about the family  about your nonrelationship with his grandmother  hows he supposed to understand that  and in general  the whole strain of the current atmosphere in your household  but that dont give him the right to mouth off  sounds to me like anthony jr  may have stumbled onto existentialism  fucking internet  no its a european philosophy  after world war ii  people were disillusioned  by the sheer weight of the horrors  thats when the whole idea took root  that there were no absolute truths  you believe that  in your family  even motherhood is up for debate  no its not  i teach him to love and respect and appreciate his mother  what about your mother  anthony i think its important we talk about your mother  and what she tried to do to you  dont need to  she showed her true colors thats all  has anthony jr heard you say shes dead to me  i dont know  dont you think that kind of talk  could lead a kid to embrace these ideas  oh so now this is my fault  when some people first realize that theyre solely responsible  for their decisions actions and beliefs  and that death lies at the end of every road  they can be overcome with intense dread  intense dread  a dull aching anger  that leads them to conclude  that the only absolute truth is death  i think the kids onto something  its puttin me off way off  okay ready ready to go  okay pictures up lock it up  ready to roll wait  standby to roll quiet please  roll sound

no youre jon favreau  rocky marciano deep impact swingers  heres the thing  your script is set in the world  that im interested in doing my next project on  a picture on the life of crazy joe gallo  joe gallo  they already did the gang that couldnt shoot straight  yeah but i see gallo as this tragic figure  he was a flawed and blinkered guy  but he wanted to learn to grow  to read to paint  he had this yearning this hunger for  fuck your mother whats the word  you as joey gallo i dont see that  im part italian  vince maybe vaughn  this project happens to be a personal passion of mine  i could play joey gallo  but i dont want to be an actor unless i can play myself  which is totally understandable  listen ever since amy told me about you  i thought maybe we could work together  you could tell me the way shit goes down  what makes sense what people really say  you know what i mean  joey gallo i was like three years old when he got whacked  yeah but speech patterns  you saw swingers  whatever you think of that motherfucker man  its like you can tell its extremely important to me  how people really talk  like that buchiach thing  how could i forget that fucking thing  i mean i grew up right in queens  i guess it is a long time ago  you wouldnt be betraying any oath thing  holy fucking shit that thing is still alive  if i told you 15 years ago that she was a piece of ass  would you believe me  what  what happened  forget it  cmon man were just talking  wise guy friend of mine would kill me if he knew i told you  this made guy right  had the most discriminating eye when it comes to ta  hes at a club one night this broads all over him  and shes got a really nice body  shes horny as hell  they step outside they walk over to this picnic ground  she starts blowing him next to this swing set  hes about to shoot his load  he reaches down to start fingering  undoes the skirt reaches in  grabs hold of a goddamn prick  jesus christ  crying game  this is a true story

anthony  cmon a j  its fun  i know i just dont feel like it  sometimes you got to do things you dont want to  why  cause your parents say so  its part of your tradition  baseballs not part of my tradition  it aint  your dad in high school  was almost all county left field  im not talking about that im talking about your confirmation here  i dont want to get confirmed  why not  dont matter why not  if youre looking for a purpose in life  doing whats right is your purpose  thats not what nitch says  who  nietzsche  let me tell you something  nietzsche wound up talking to his horse  and i know what youre gonna tell me  sartre right  sartre was a fucking fraud  he copped it all from husserl and heidegger  go on  you should start at the beginning  take a look at kierkegaard  whatever  kierkegaard saidevery duty is essentially duty to god  nigga be a leader not a follower  what  master p said that  you still listen to rap  why  its just all about marketing now  hi welcome to soho grand  im here to see jon favreau  one moment please  whom may i say is calling  jerry from newark hes expecting me  im sorry sir mr favreau requested not to be disturbed  tell him his 200 pm is waiting  he has his telephone programmed so as to not be disturbed  its 200 in the fucking afternoon  would you care to leave a message  would you you see if amy safir is in  hey  what you doing here  i was supposed to be meeting jon to discuss my script  but now hes got the do not disturb on  yeah shooting ran late we didnt wrap till 530  cmon in  i brought him jerseys best sangweech  fucking best in the world  that was very nice  you want it  oh no thanks i brushed my teeth  here have a seat  you want some coffee  no i cant stay i got business to take care of  if they ever knew i was into this  what im saying is  this kind of thing is unacceptable where i come from  do you know if he read my script yet  i have your script  what  jon asked me to give it an official read  dont take it personally its his process  billy bob wrote something he wanted to do with jon  and jon had me read it first  hello  hey honey your cousins here  yeah thats right the screenwriter  okay i will  gregory says go fuck yourself  union square cafe okay  alright ill see you there bye  what did you think about it  about what  my script  i love movies i started with the dialogue  but then you gotta find the conflict  and tell the story in picture arcs  i think its its got some real heart  some good raw emotion in it  you should probably try and finish it  yeah i hit a fucking wall  third act shit  vicki king in 21 days to how to write a movie in  she says thats not uncommon  these arent third act problems theyre in the second act  get the fuck out of here  see you ended right here in the middle of page 83  yeah this sentence couldve gone either way  see when frankie says  i dont know whether to shit or go blind  hes at a crossroads he doesnt know  thats an expression right  like a joke shit or go blind  well no cause later on  his father gets that cancer of the eye  what do they call that glaucoma  whatever the fuck runs in the family  they have to get him a guide dog  oh  but the third act starts at page 90  im not in the third fucking act yet  youre inciting incident doesnt happen till page 12  it should be on page three  i knew that arc shit fucked me up  i tried making it all these three dimensions like she said  here sit ill show you  okay  see i was thinking  if you take the scene where rocco  is fucking the two asian strippers  thats a plot point  i know i know  but my question is whats at stake  the jeopardys unclear  what jeopardy  theres a seven part hierarchy of human needs  that explains and clarifies what drives us  starting with the basic needs like food  and water  so you like my script  its very good christopher  you want me to tell you what all seven are  seven what  the human needs  yeah  survival  yeah  safety and security  yeah  the need to understand  hi grandma  grandma  who is it  you woke me  its me anthony jr  i didnt know i had a grandson  i miss you  yeah you should  you never come see me  ive been busy  everybodys busy  and dont lie to me  i know your father forbids your coming down here  he doesnt honest  he just doesnt want us to talk about you in the house  you can go shit in his hat  hes mad at me right now  i shouldnt use that kind of talk  dont let me ever catch you talking that way  now what did you do bad  my dad doesnt like my attitude  so uncle pussy said that i should come talk to you  because youre old and have wisdom and stuff  his mothers another one  well whatd you do  i took moms car out of the garage and it got wrecked  you ought to be ashamed of yourself  was it bad  uncle pussy already fixed it  did you wear your safety belt  yeah  because there was an article in the paper the other day  about a bunch of teen agers  from out near the delaware water gap  they overcrowded their car it hit a tree  and it incinerated  and they got trapped  people could hearem screaming they couldnt get out  the safety belts did it buckled them in  see that s what i mean  whats the purpose  of what  being here on our planet  earth  those kids are dead meat  whats the use  whats the purpose  why does everything have to have a purpose  the world is a jungle  if you want my advice anthony  dont expect happiness you wont get it  people let you down  and im not naming any names  but in the end you die in your own arms  you mean alone  its all a big nothing  what what makes you think youre so special  guess i wont order us any espresso  i took an acting class once  oh yeah howd that go for you  but i didnt need it  oh yeah  i figured out as far as movies go  i want to be a player not an actor  smart man like bugsy  that was another thing that kind of blew about swingers  the acting  you know whats good fucking acting  hanks private ryan  earn it  its kind of unfai r to compare the two  ones about young soldiers dying on the beach at normandy  the other ones about young guys lookin for blow jobs in vegas  well you made the movie  so  listen  you mind if i ask you something  you strapped

if my voice gets scratchy its not cool  whatd you think of my script  well  you know like frankie  i know frankie hes my fucking leading man  hes  hes kind of like a contradictory character  in a good way you know like complex  you think he should wear those taps on his shoes  thats the questio n i was gonna ask you  they sound cool theyre his trademark  but in the hit against rocco  somebodys gonna hear him walking on the roof  thats a problem  what i was thinking was  in this script in all scripts really  it begs to show more of the author in it  your life your vision  the roof is soft tar  thatll work  the roof is soft tar  okay  and the father could you know  go blind sooner and then  then he could smell the tar on frankies shoes  then he knows that his sons the killer  holy fuck
