stocks is a cash business  can i tell you something  sure  i dont think i can have kids  what why  i cant believe im telling you this  its just that i feel really close to you  a long time ago before christopher even  i had an abortion  i didnt want to i know it was wrong  but the guy was such an asshole it was really the best thing  anyway there were complications  my gynecologist says that theres a good chance  i wont be able to hold a pregnancy  oh god i cant believe im telling you this  christopher dont even know my own mother even  sometimes it helps to talk  they can do incredible things these days ade  when the time comes  i know a great obgyn that my sister went to in the city  really  you just show up without calling i thought you were going out  im a man of many mysteries

with those jobs   what did tony say  it was tony made him do it  i wished albert happy birthday for you  whos been to see my ma  i dont think anybody paulie  chrissy says tony sent her some chocolates  chrissy said t made a killing in real estate down frelinghuysen  that assemblyman guy hyped him to it  ralph told this funny fucking joke though  at alberts party  he goes  ginny sack had a 95pound mole  surgically taken off her ass    he said that  yeah  and you think its funny  its in bad taste  the fuck  thats not what i want  i want 50 ts 50 reverse got that  guys  pick up those icecream wrappers  if i were a carpenter  and you were a douche bag  what are you doing  breaking my balls whats it look like  i tell you this noshow shit is tough  deciding what not to wear to work what not

all here  you remember to put the spores in there  thats not funny  what the fucks all that  fiberoptic cable highspeed internet access  lot of money in this shit  the kid was supposed to get a job this summer an internship  then it wasnt right for what she was studying okay  thats one down  then she was gonna be a hostess at artie buccos restaurant i got her that  then she couldnt work tuesdays and thursdays  cause of her babysitting commitment and artie didnt try to understand  so she left  then the babysitting family disappeared to nantucket  then something else fell through and then  so shes regressing  she keeps it up shell be back in the womb  over the course of a childs life  theres a constant moving away and coming back  security versus freedom  but what i find interesting and thats if i hear you right  is that at the age of 19  she actually wants to stay close to home  see thats what i was gonna say   she did have someone close die  jackie  but she brings that up whenever you ask her to clean up after herself or whatever  that shes traumatized  he was shot to death  its tragic that kid  it was some kind of drug deal you said  exactly all the earmarks  its gotta be tough  then again theyd been broken up and he wasnt very nice to her  it may be a manipulation in part  shes got a hardon about columbia its so competitive   but it doesnt mean that her pain over jackies death isnt real  has she said to you or carmela shes depressed  come on with that shit shes gonna be all right  maybe she should be on medication  and her anger is focused on carmela not on you  i catch some shit  but me and mead were always close even in that 15yearold period you know  when she could hardly stomach carmela  you are the dad  the template for all future lovers  she loves me i know that  since she was a tiny baby  might be helpful if she saw someone  dr wendi kobler  shes an adolescent psychologist and an educational consultant  what do you mean  talk about private family stuff like i do here with you  yes  like you said shes going back to school  shes gonna be with her college pals back to the grindstone  thats all good shit  i thought you had final

what the fucks in europe  experience  real life art  i knew all this constant harping on art was gonna cause trouble  gonna work in publicity or something  some friend of mistys is making a movie in denmark  i think we should call that therapist  shes going back to school they got counselors there  better ones ivy league ones  no fucking way shes going to europe  fine  maybe they dont have to talk  maybe theyre the kind of couple that doesnt have to talk constantly  one beer left  danielle was over we had pizza  i figured out whats wrong with that broad and its some bad shit  whats the

of your new job  i am  this is my goodbye party with heroin  you want to do a hit  i dont know i did some blow at the club  its funny with tony  its like danielle was saying how we send food to the poorer countries  no good deed goes unpunished  what is it with you and this girl   what i cant have friends  youre amazing you know that  with all your intelligence you never see the big picture   you met her where  at the mall so  think adriana  girl like that ass like that  she dont have a boyfriend she dont like paulie   like hes jude law  whatever  are you that fucking blind  shes a dyke  you think  use your head its a 250 million job   my head it was your idea  excuse me  when the kid there vito told you how expensive the shit was  i dont know you gave me a look  a look  so now youre

mention  at the winnipeg film festival last year for his short  forget money what about security  you think traipsing around europes a smart move these days  like europes any less safe than here  look you dont seem to get it  i keep having images of jackie aprile lying in a pool of his own blood  in some street somewhere  so what french discos drive away all sad thoughts  what mom youve never heard of the restorative nature of travel  read henry james  why does every college have junior year abroad if there isnt a need for it  then why dont you wait for junior year its eight months  cause i need it now  you want to go to europe go  clear your head run with the bulls  do whatever it is the hell they do over there  thank you i will  dont you think she should talk to someone first  a counselor maybe  maybe the college of hard knocks is what she needs  lets see how she likes it when a gypsy lifts her wallet  or learn you cant work without a permit  which the french hang on to like their balls  thank you for that united front  the more we object the more shell want to go you know her  shes going i dont understand you with this flipflop  shell meet other boys  maybe an italian boy an actual italian one jackiell stop playing a big part   you would want her married to a foreigner  married no jesus  although look at furio whats so bad about him  you do what you want  but i am not gonna stand idle while she throws her education away  what are you gonna do  shes not gonna take this drastic step without talking to someone first  come on  dr melfis person is an educational consultant  maybe she can explain to her how dropping out now  is not going to look at all good to medical schools  we could use an ally here  some adult besides us to toe the line for accountability and responsibility  so maybe you go on an antidepressant to tide you over  youre not paying for it  i dont know maybe  anyway it was supposed to be his funeral  jacks  and they all stood around  drinking and blubbering  at these egregious saccharine fucking italian ballads  it was revolting  after i left the restaurant i actually vomited   you were drinking  smoked a joint with my friends too  thats okay  as long as you didnt deliberately purge  when i asked you earlier what dad does for a living  you said  waste management wink wink  what does wink wink mean  okay  hes like  you know  you mentioned jacks father was in the mafia  i didnt realize your dad was too  theres no such thing as the mafia  i said jackies dad was a loan shark  how did dad react when he heard jack had been killed  he was pretty upset  he used to tell jackie all the time dont get involved stay in school   get involved  with what  drugs  right  the x  so dad was a positive force in jacks life  jackie  yeah  you dont like talking much about dad do you  he doesnt bother me  im gonna ask you a question about dad  this may be very painful for you  did dad ever molest you   no  i dont tell them what we discuss  i dont think so   what about mom  god no  unless you consider obsessing about my fucking gpa an assault which i do  she has to learn that education is a lifelong process  thats what i told them  a college degree is a nice thing sure but not at the sake of emotional wellbeing  thats exactly what i said  perhaps they should examine their own needs to have you stay in school  blow off their selfesteem issues  so you book on columbia you can come back when youre ready  or i could write you a letter to the university of barcelona  its a hot school  im on a consultancy there   busy out
