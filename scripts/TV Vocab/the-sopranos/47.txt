cant fix the shit im talking about  i dont wanna be where ralph cifaretto has been  you prick  a onetime thing is one thing but to get into a relationship  i gotta get back to my dinner  you dont know anything let me tell you whats really going on  he doesnt fuck me  i swear to god hes some kind of freak or something   you two dont have sex  no   sort of yeah but not  all right have a nice life  go ahead  you go back first ill wait a minute we shouldnt go back together   everything come out all right  yeah   its me valentina  you got no reason to be calling me  i have to tell you everything  i mean i didnt want to tell you before because its just so embarrassing  where are you   im at ralphs  oh christ  no its okay  he left  ralph does not have sex like other people regular people  its all some kind of kinky shit believe me i am not hungup  ive done a lot ive done girls  ive done threesomes and ive done   with him  no tony please just listen  ralph is loco for real okay  he just makes me do stuff not realy even sexual  like last night i just wanted him to fuck me just so i can get back at you  but all he wanted me to do was drip candle wax on his balls  then he went into the bathroom and jerked himself off  now i dont call that having sex with someone  oh jesus h christ  last week i swear to god  he told me to rub his dick raw with a cheese grater   get the fuck out of here  i wouldnt do it  i told him to fuck off  my accountant is here   wil you cal me  i gotta go  mozzarella  let me ask you a question  you think ralphs a little weird about women  i dont know ton  i mean he beat one to death just for  i forget what was it again   maybe youre feeling guilty  i dont see that  why would i  because hes a friend of yours and youre cuckolding him  cuckolding is when a man has an affair with anothers wife  shes not his wife anyway shes his cumare   and therefore has no status whatever  cumares have status  i mean its not like in the old days when a man had a wife  and then sort of a second wife  used to be the men would take out their wives on fridays  and their cumares on saturdays  or maybe its the other way around  anyway when i came up it wasnt so formal  business associate of mines got two full families  one up here one down in sea girt  and his second wife busts his balls identical to the first  sounds like a complicated arrangement   im afraid our time is up  just give me another minute   i have a patient waiting  well let him wait  you make me wait out there all the time  i just wanna ask you if its possible for a man to go out with a woman  without really doing anything with them   youll have to be more specific  he likes them to hurt him  and thats it  and then he goes and he  takes care of himself his own needs  he sounds like a textbook masochist   like s  m  the m part yes  i thought all that stuff was just like a runup to the act  thats the case for many people  but not for people with paraphilias  for them receiving pain being humiliated  becomes in and of itself the sexual release  like many other things we believe its rooted in childhood   we can continue this next week  just one more second  i received regular beatings when i was a kid  but im not going around looking for some woman  to hook up jumper cables to my private parts  its not a simple onetoone  more than likely he had a controlling and punishing mother  she loved him but showed it only in connection  with some sort of violent or abusive act  is everything about everybody really about their mothers  all right back to the other thing  for a guy like that hes going out with a woman  he could technically not have penisary contact with her vulva  it sounds like youre asking me for personal information  i really cant give you  good morning pickwick framing  hello  its so heartbreaking to hear those women talk about what they were going through  and what they are going through  the second woman joan her case is realy not very unusual  her husband was the financial planner she realy did not have  much involvement in the finances at the home  what are your thoughts on that  women tend to have the feeling that theyre not confident  men tend to be overconfident actualy in the financial area  and women have to take responsibility and have to accept the fact  that something like this  we dont need no  we dont need no thought control  you have to have a contingency plan if your husband doesnt come home  to take care of the finances  you gotta get up ma you cant lie there day and night  i wanna go home  there is no more home ma we sold it you know that  they keep making me eat all alone  thats that cookie and minn i tried to be so nice  i bought cookie a card from the gift shop downstairs  i cared enough and i sent the very best  dont you worry ma  im gonna talk to this social director shes the one to straighten this all out  but in the meantime maybe you can make new friends  but you gotta get up out of bed at least sit up  no  friggitoria fiorenzano  in my opinion this is probably one of the closest things wei find in naples  to what you realy should open its an al day snack shop pizzeria  friggitoria and rosticceria  roast shop fry shop pizza shop  here are four examples  of the classic neapolitan pride  its in a light batter fried til very crisp  weve got those zucchini flowers you recognize those  were bringing her back to the track in two weeks  lois says shes ready to race   thanks  thanks hon  i like my drink with extra olives  you should know how your regular customers like their drinks  my regular customers are the ones who pay  ill get you your olives  what do you have to give her shit for  she likes it its banter  i dont think she likes it or you  i dont give a flying fuck my brother what any little slit thinks of me  does that include whats her name   who  you brought her to the stables  valentina her especially  and her im crazy about  im telling you this broad knows things  ive never been fucked so long or so good  i may have to marry her  these enough  you know no reason to be snotty  my dear departed mother used to say  you catch more flies with honey  than you can with vinegar   well mine always told me not to let myself be talked down to by losers  she said you can tell everything about a man by the way he treats women   you ever think about your mother  shes dead  you two didnt get along very well right  she had her demanding ways   when you were a kid did she ever  no i gotta go  the mambo queen awaits  im sorry your moms having a difficult adjustment period   sit  its not her  its the rest of them they single her out  sometimes i think this place is like high school with wheelchairs  tell your mother to be patient things will settle down  all right ill talk to her again  but what the hell are you gonna do for us   what we pay here  im speaking from years of experience  your moms going to have to learn  to accept responsibility for her own behavior  like what  go ahead  for one thing she cries a lot  shes always in tears  at mass in the exercise room at music appreciation   shes got a big heart  let me finish  she doesnt always put her teeth in  the girls dont like that   this is not good  right  also shes a tattletale  she tells on the other girls for the slightest infraction  shes just not very adept at making friends  shes gonna have to make more of an effort  you might want to talk to her about this  hey conny contino ever get those washing machines  i dont understand you want to know this shit  cause you go back on everything sil and me get settled  i dont got a right to be concerned  hold on   go  long time no see   is this you  i am me   ive been busy you know  then i forgive you  when can i see you ive got something to tell
