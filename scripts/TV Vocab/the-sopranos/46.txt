the defense requests a conference in chambers  wel stand in recess for 15 minutes  while the court confers with counsel in chambers  bailiff wil you escort the jury out  did she say anything to you

shit in the back  well go get breakfast  oh aspetta ill go with you  any investment advice for an ambitious young man such as myself  buy land i guess god aint making any more of it  thats what will rogers said  its true my house is worth nearly triple what i paid  locations the key right otherwise you get stuck with shit  sometimes theres money in shit  how do you mean   nothing i dont know  were just talking here come on  i dont know some guy i went to school with this black guy  we worked one summer for this notforprofit housing group  told me about some scam his minister was involved with up in harlem  i read about this  forgazee mortgage loans or something right   actually you ever hear of hud  housing development yeah  hud was set up to help minorities and lowincome families to be homeowners  there are more programs for these deadbeats i swear to christ  if the feds guarantee the home mortgage the banks figure why not  theyll loan the money  you get a front man to buy houses in some crummy neighborhood  talking about some real shitboxes maybe theyre worth 100000 apiece  next you tie up with some nonprofit organization who goes to hud  and says they intend to buy these houses from your stooge  theyre gonna convert them to homes for workingclass blacks blahblahblah  thing is though  all right sit tight im gonna be a while  ill be over here  maurice and i met in college all the way to the university of michigan  to make friends with a guy who lived 20 blocks away from me  you shouldve seen the jewfro on this guy out to here  so maurice ron tells me youre from down roseville street  my father was a typesetter for the starledger  no shit   sixth and orange  then we were practically neighbors  yeah thats why he moved   hello  carmela its me furio  i guess i

right  but come july  the newark riots  what a fucking summer that was  later that year maurice and i helped organize one of the first black voting drives  maurice were you around for anthony imperiale   the white knight  around   who do you think he was fighting against  italian pride keep newark white   aspiring klansmen some of those boys  so this group you got now the urban housing league  whats the story there  like many nonprofits  weve fallen on hard times  republican administration plus a proliferation  of new charities post 9l11  sounds like you got a lot to talk about im gonna hit the showers  maurice nice meeting you  same here  i took the liberty of filling maurice in on the broad strokes  okay we got a guy dr fried hes a urologist  well give him 500000 of our money  have him grab up these four houses on garside street  for 125000 apiece  the old first ward  once we own the houses we got an appraiser wholl play ball  hes gonna reappraise them in the 300000 range  what you do maurice is take the phony appraisals to hud  tell them your urban housing thing wants to buy up these shitholes  convert them to lowcost housing for working families  once hud guarantees the mortgage app you take it to the bank  they cut a check and we work it up nice  at which point i assume my organization fails to make the mortgage payment  unforeseen construction delays and repeated vandalism  force the project into dissolution  we all walk away from the houses  your cutll be in the 10 percent of the profit range  my officell write a letter in strong support of your application  sounds about right  tony good  youre still here   is there a problem  no problem i just wanna talk to you  you remember that time in atlantic city  you brought irina your old girlfriend

believe it or not the chilites were signed to the same label  as tommy james and them damn shondells  see a lot of people think that but theyre wrong  chilites were on brunswick  see you soon  so tony

owner  eat my dust donald trump   hey adriana  jesus christ  why dont you go haunt a house or something  its been a while figured id check in  so you crawl up my ass  what do you want robyn  i heard paulie gualtieris out of jail   what do i know  how does christopher feel about that  christopher likes paulie theyre friends  is that a crime now too  how is christopher anyway he looked tired last time i saw him  if youre gonna turn me into a traitor fine  but do me a favor and stop asking about him like you give a shit how he is  how is he doing with his drug problem  he doesnt have a drug problem  how are you doing ade  really  im fine were both fine  as a matter of fact were thinking of finally getting married  you have a good time today  yeah it was cool i love the ocean  feel like taking a ride  see that church  your great grandfather helped build that almost 80 years ago  he was a stonemason the old man  came over from avellino with 4 in his pocket  yeah but i saw in a book where you could get a hotel room  for like 10 cents a week then  room service mustve been like one or two cents a meal  room service  were talking about history here aj  your familys history newarks history   who gives a shit about newark  im making a point  this neighborhood used to be beautiful  hundred percent italian  the 1920s most of them right off the boat  most italians couldnt even find a church that wanted them  so what did they do did they cry  did they go to the government with their hand out no  they took care of their own problems  they said you dont want us here fine well build our own a better one   look at all these buildings around here  most of them are falling down into the ground  but that church is still standing  you know why  the bricks  cause our people give a shit thats why  every sunday italians from the old neighborhood drive miles  to come here to pray  they keep this place alive  so how come we never do  buy land aj cause god aint making any more of it  this is advice im imparting to you as your father  now what  are you afraid  right like i havent seen places like this before  see those houses over there  im buying them  those crappy ones what for  for an investment  what have i been saying  i dont know  real estate buy real estate  dad the black dudes coming over   hey whats up  whats up  fiveo  yeah im starsky and this is hutch  smoke crack or crank  no thank you were just having a look around   no eyeing if you aint buying man  thought this was a free country  unless you want something motherfucker get the fuck off our street  the language on you   you blow your father with that mouth  what the fuck you say to my sister  relax i dont want trouble im showing my son the old neighborhood  this is our neighborhood now guinea motherfucker  yeah i can see that  so thats a crack ho  keep your fucking cracker ass off my motherfucking block  come on ease up  shes really gonna marry him   what is wrong with this girl  come on  moltisantis a great catch  tall dark and sociopathic  from a strategic standpoint do the nuptials help us or hurt us  if they do get married  brings them closer obviously  and by extension gets her closer to tony  it could cause her to stop cooperating  the guilt becomes overwhelming  remember angel diletto  i think its more likely to have the opposite effect  his problems really become her problems  if they have kids thats even more pressure  the dilettos never had kids  i wouldnt count on children  shes had some issues female trouble  maybe darwin was right  nature really does weed out the nimrods  so what do we do people yay or nay  supportive or discouraging  if anyone objects to this marriage speak now or forever hold your peace  i say neutral or supportive  even if we discourage it shell go through with it anyway  agreed then they have our blessing  to the happy couple  these doctors own so much property  youre going to buy four houses on garside street  youve certainly got your work cut out for you  one day at a time  keep on keeping on  tony come on in  you know it really wouldve been better if we met over at dennys  what are you worried about i was in the neighborhood  so whats up  can i get you something scotch right  i sent some of my guys down there to start gutting the place  turned out one of the houses was a crack den   so  what so   we got to get them out of there  why

from a policing standpoint  its one group of recidivists beating on another  stop trying to justify it  its about the 7000  let me tell you something else  guys like tony you dont fool around with these people  my son  i dont know what he understands  im trying to tell him about the immigrants hes talking about room service  we need to talk about your recent behavior in here   your angry tirade  you want to talk about that now  that was weeks ago  it was my judgment that at the time you were in crisis about glorias suicide  didnt you get the flowers i sent  your behavior was unacceptable anthony  you cannot have these outbursts and expect to redeem yourself  with an ftd bouquet  im sorry all right  its good that youre sorry but no its not all right  weve been down this road before  i know  the fact that youre angry is fine  and its okay to talk about your anger  but when it manifests itself in physicality  it becomes unacceptable  i never laid a finger on you  you loomed   you threw my tissue holder  then i picked it up  i was very upset   you lied to me  i did not lie to you  you withheld information about a very sensitive subject  all right look  i know what i did was wrong okay  and you may not believe this  but i did exercise impulse control and i have been controlling my anger  this thing with my son i went to show him the old neighborhood  and we got accosted by these crackheads  one of them had a gun the other one threw a bottle at my car  now it may not sound like much but i let it go i drove away  well in the future ill ask that you extend to me  the

rickys wedding bobby canzoneri didnt cover his plate  shut up  40 in an envelope not even a card  ill tell you though the main thing about getting married  i can never be called to testify  what do you mean   a wife cant testify against her husband  right  actually though i dont think thats actually true  what do you mean  they did a whole murder she wrote about that  this butler thought his wife couldnt testify against her husband  but it turns out legally she actually could  to claim marital privilege three conditions must be met  the communication must be made during the course of the marriage  anything said before you were married is fair game  two the communication must involve only the spouses  the presence of a third party destroys the privilege  three communication cant be made in furtherance of a crime  oh my god its a simple question can they make me testify or not  the short answer  probably  in organized crime a rico the feds will spend a fortune putting on their case  believe me if they want you to testify theyre going to find a way  here you go 10 percent apiece  technically its a little less  but our friend rounded you up to an even 60000  theres plenty more where that came from  a lot of poor families need affordable housing in newark  ronnie listen  i didnt want to say this   no hard feelings  of course not   you sure youre all right  im fine
