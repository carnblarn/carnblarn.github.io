chrissakes  shes wants to be some kind of a professional woman  like you  a psychiatrist  and have to listen to guys like me whine all day  she mentioned bein g a pediatrician once  youd like that

never make it  your father an d i have to drive a j  up to hudson institute for his interview  i would feel much bett er if you were up and moving  jackies dead  and you perseverate on secondary schools  i was up half the night with ro  and this morning her sister and i  made all the funeral arrangements  your brother doesnt a have school  he cant be allowed  to sit around chatting all day on the web  with the other dropouts and the flakes  you know  hes the first person my own age  that i knew that ever died  he knew all the risks involved  what the x  half the kids i know take it  they have to get it from someone  its not something you get killed over  except that he did  or not  meaning  look at who he grew up with  look at who his father was  look at everybody we know  lets not get cute  when im being cute ill let you know  you liked jackie  so you dont want to believe that he did this to himself  so like a lot of other people  you go around looking for boogie men to blame  boogie men with italian names  so whatever youre thinking  you just stop thinking it right now  because that is not what happened  left left left  stealing an exam thats quite a personal defeat isnt it  it was wrong  that sounds pre programmed  that how you saw your future self  when you were a younger man a cheat  no  how do you explain it  theres like all thi s academic pressure  about gett ing into college  my school theyre like obsessed  theres like academic pressure  or academic pressure  theres all this pressure my parents too  my sister she goes to columbia  and i know my parents expect me to go  around here we all call that stinkin thinkin  its precisely the same with an alcoholic  no one makes him put that drink to his lips but himself  im not an alcoholic  how do we do things differently here at hmi  than at your former school  i dont know  i realize you dont know im about to tell you  at your school and its not a bad school  youre right  theres too much emphasis on whats good for you  whats good for johnny whats good for janey  here the higher good is the good of the corps  as general macarthur said  in his farewell address at the point  the corps the corps the corps  now how do we achieve  this revolutionary change in thinking on your part  cadet corps has first call and formation 0530 each day  march in formation to first mess 0620  followed by dorm inspection 0700  classes 0800 to 1440  athletic formation 1500 except thursdays  which is drill or commanders time  evening study time  taps lights out 2200 hours whats missing  give up television  whats 0530 mean   i just outlined for you  a blueprint for total self discipline  that would take you through your entire life  and thats your only question  why do guys in the army or like spies  use that o thing when they tell time  thatll be made abundantly clear to you  for now we have an expression around here  keep it simple  capt delaunay  please give mr soprano the standard t o i  while i meet with his parents  sir yes sir  i for one think anthony could greatly benefit from our program  which as i candidly told him is very rigorous  do you mind  i will be very frank with you major zwingli  i do not agree with this hard nosed discipline  the mother s seldom do  wait till he starts opening doors foryou  and pulling back your chair  that would b e a miracle  but thats not even something we thought we could hope for  what about creativity tony independent thought  i stressed rat her heavily with anthony  the notions of duty and group think  but i didnt for now mention to him  the armys motto of today  be an army of one  why be an army at all  how about a veterinarian  isnt there enough war  amputees  horrible displaced  jesus hes just gonna march around a little bit  i wouldnt get too hung up on the marching aspect  its part of it  but its nothing compared to the mentoring  that comes through small class size  and faculty involvement in dorm life  well that sounds wonderful certainly  weve created too many options for our kids  we cant blame the m for being confused  then when things go wrong  we fob them off onto the ever burgeoning  for profit substance recovery industry  this army of one thing  what happens when each army of one decides  fuck it i not goin over the top of the foxhole  or why dont we just blow the lieutenants head off  because theyve been told you know  youre an army of one  i would submit audie murphy was an army of one  is that what were preparing him for  a career in the military  no no  one day at a time  you want to train him to be a professional killer  oh will you stop  theyre soldiers  and the united states army hardly goes to war anymore  they were marching with rifles tony  theyre symbolic the barrels are plugged  symbolic of what  respect  he will be subjected to the discipline of kids  hardly older than himself  does that seem smart  boys his age still kil l frogs and small animals  the cusamanos binky  the cherry bomb with the nails in it  you think it was a j  no that is what im trying to tell you  he is still a chil d hes a normal child  hes made some mistakes and god knows  hes got a shit lo ad to learn about life  that does not mean that im gonna let you  send him to the type of school whose whole reason for being  is to make him follow orders by instilling fear  he thinks the world owes him a fucking living  what could have given him that bizarre idea  we tried it your way for 15 years now  with the berry brazleton the validating his feelings  and that fuckin school did the same thing  and what a surprise  he thinks the world runs on his feelings  well hes gonna go learn to be a man  i will not send hi m to that place  oh no fuck that allow me  fuck  t  about the sit down  i havent
