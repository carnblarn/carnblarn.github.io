on channel 6  turn on channel 6  new jersey attorney general james d ricci stated at a fund raiser  that a grand jury has been impanelled to investigate  possible mob activities in the garden state with indictments to follow  with us is syndicated columnist and author ofmafia  americas longest running soap opera jeffrey wernick  first of all welcome thank you pleasure to be here  for years now the f b i has been telling us that the mafia is all but dead  let me interject while it is true  that the mob is getting a standing eight count  uh i wouldnt call the fight  the government knows this better than anyone  murder truck hijacking as well as money laundering are expected to be among the inquiries  do we know yet the names of those who will be indicted  well the indictments are sealed  but with the recent death of acting di meo family boss jackie aprile  my sources tell me that corrado junior soprano  was made new boss after the death of aprile  the sopranos have long historic ties to the new york families  what about these possible murder charges  they will undoubtedly be focused on the as yet unsolved  execution style slaying of soprano family associate brendan filone  uh was it part of a power struggle interesting  no one would ever have ranked him as associate my associates tell me that  filone is a loyal soldier if you will and he winds up dead soldier  brendan filone associate soldier  fuck you jesus  georgie did you see it from the beginning did they mention my name  no stop the fuckin chitchat all right i gotta go i gotta go  nobody makes ginzo gravy like you nana  you know im up at bard waiting for my care package  i dont like that word jason   what ginzo  the word is offensive  shes right jason its not a nice word sorry nana   whats it mean  derived from the word guinea   whats that mean  its a derogation  i have a patient you wouldnt wanna say the word guinea in front of him  huh italian male seeing a shrink  let me guess mother issues   why wouldnt you say it mom  you just wouldnt  what youd be scared is he in the mafia i shouldnt have mentioned it  cant we change the subject  no way whats he do mom is he in the mob or what  hes not a mobster is he jen  nobody knows better than you richard i cant discuss my patients  i just hope hes not one of those crumbs theyre talkin about on the news  jen just refer him to another doctor you could do that couldnt you   grate the cheese dad okay  sure she can  that might be what you would do richard  now i remember why we got divorced  why should i refer him to another doctor hes my patient  you know you cant treat sociopaths  hes scum and you shouldnt help him with his bed wetting  you have no idea who this man is and yet you call him scum  people like him are the reason italian americans have such a bad image  i agree ask any american to describe an italian american  and invariably hes gonna referencethe godfather goodfellas  good movies and the rest are gonna mention pizza  good movies to eat pizza by  stop it jason i never said he was in the mafia  why do you think were never gonna see an italian president  and thats my patients fault   hey  i realize youre very involved in the antidefamation lobby  so go after hollywood if you feel you absolutely have to but leave my patient alone  its a synergy news items and the constant portrayal of italian americans as gangsters  wasnt the italian antidef deal started by joe colombo a mobster  italians against discrimination did a study  and in its height the mafia in this country had less than 5 000 members  and yet that tiny insignificant fraction  cast such a dark shadow over 20 million hard working americans  dad at this point in our cultural history  mob movies are classic american cinema like westerns  i have to agree there rich you know  you never saw that scotch irish pissin and moanin  about always bein portrayed as as rustlers and gunslingers  thats absurd see what you started with your gravy nana  to we the 20 million   salute  salute  salute   what   get down here right away were exterminatin  im kind of busy now  and get some sfogliatelle and cannoli and shit for the guys  yeah  twenty nine  here you go

right im worried about you  my god they mentioned your name in the newspaper today  thestar ledger mrs jones told me  with all those scumbags  its been a while since we met for therapy  mm hmm  jason hows bard  im moving into a smoke free dorm  and how do we feel about that  im more interested in discussing what we mentioned before  jason are you concerned that your mother is treating this patient x  i dont care  as a colleague jen i suggest you drop the patient  after her last encounter with him she finally acknowledged  that she saw the different side of him the subhuman  i take it you were frightened  frightened revolted  at long last appropriate emotions  oh for christs sake richard you too sam   when did we become so afraid to get our hands dirty  its what she gets paid for  jason how would you like to see your mother  never mind im not gonna paint any graphic images  see he always does that   what  follow that up jas dad does what  his real issue is that i should distance myself from this man  on the grounds of the stigma that he brings us  i say refer this patient to a therapist  that specializes in mafia depression   sam this isnt funny  no of course not  jen has a real honest to goodness personal  and professional dilemma  you know on my mothers side we have a few dark sheep  excuse me  lepke  whos lepke  louis lepke buchalter  you know murder incorporated  my mothers uncle was lepkes wheel man  his driver  uh huh  those were some tough jews
