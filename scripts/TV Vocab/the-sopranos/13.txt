theyre transferring her to the nursing unit  which is  the thing that she dreaded and feared  isnt it interesting how this memory loss has cropped up  right after you failed to be killed in the carjacking   you think it was a carjacking  course not  but i got an idea who was behind it  and  nuff said   you dont want to go there  maybe you dont want to go there  what are you talkin about well

literally  look ordinarily a patient is helped to make his own breakthroughs  but your life is in danger so okay im willing to put the cards on the table  i say what your mother has at the very least  is what we call borderline personality disorder  a borderline personality disorder  let me read to you from the d s m  iv okay  definitions of the condition  a pattern of unstable relationships  affective instability  it means intense anxiety a joylessness  these peoples internal phobias are the only things that exist to them  the real world real people are peripheral  these people have no love or compassion  borderline personalities are very good at splitting behavior  creating bitterness and conflict between others in their circle  you twisted fuckin bitch  thats my mother were talkin about not some fuck up in attica  stabbed you in the shower relax  see were through you and i were finished  and youre lucky if i dont break your fuckin face in 50 000 pieces  okay  i mean lets face

racketeering charges  f b i and local police talk about fuckin timing   hes lucky hes still alive  along with lawrence larry boy barese  ailing alleged underboss joseph beppy sasso and  oh my god its uncle junior  yeah look at the old guy makin him do the perp walk   a legitimate businessman  dad cut the crap  go blow dry your hair  these indictments are part of an ongoing investigation  stretching back nearly four years  they represent the most crippling blow to mob activities  in the new jersey area since the early 1980s  uncle junior got busted  cool  not seized today although named in the indictments  was alleged soprano enforcer and loan sharking chief michael grab bag palmice  authorities believe palmice may have fled the new jersey area acting on prior knowledge  oh lucky him earlier today  palmices wife denied any knowledge of her husbands whereabouts  yeah he was uh he was so happy  he was going out to try out these new running shoes  you know he told me that he loved me  and that he would be right back   i cant  all right go come on go eat somewhere else  coming up next rain from canada  hello yeah counselor thanks for gettin back to me so quick  he says its a broad indictment that sounds better for the feds than it really is  i wasnt namedcause the focus of the investigation is some telephone calling card scam  that junior and larry had goin  and this diamante technical stock thing that i wasnt into  thank god  that prick altieri gave them reams of shit  they got stuff on me they got stuff on all of us  from the surveillance at the green grove  they just dont have a case yet an ongoing investigation the d a said  they always say that to make it sound good  but this is no fuckin joke  what i gotta worry about now  is the guys that got pinched today if they flip  all right good work  art hello how are things  good father busy yeah  you like the man said rust never sleeps  listen father  i want to thank you for taking the time out to talk to me the other day  ahh did you bring your wife into things no  no sitting there in the house of god i realized  you can either be a yes person or a no person  a positive ion or a negative ion  i im not quite sure i get what youre saying  its just that  this womans always been an odd bird a sea of negativity  even as a kid we all learned to take her ravings with a grain of salt  but you also said the son was unstable  complicated yes he is  little too comfortable outside the law yes he is  but it would only add to the quotient of sorrow in the world to doubt him  when the source unfortunately is a person  who rarely has a kind word for anyone  hmm you seem at peace  i am father  thank you again father sure  okay artie  do you prefer corrado or junior  i prefer mr soprano  your tenure as boss was a short one  actually it was unusual in several ways  let me put this to you as simply as i can  you can avoid sentencing on these charges if you will testify that in fact  you were not the boss of north jersey that in fact  your nephew anthony soprano wasandis  thathe de facto controlled your capos  with the backing of two of the new york families  communicating through their emissary john sacrimoni  we want johnny sack  but more than him we want mangano and teresi  i wanna fuck angie dickinson see who gets lucky first  we want you to corroborate information that we obtained  through informants and wire tap  that you were allowed to profit more or less  but you were not making policy and you were not in the new york loop  you were positioned to take the hits and now youve taken them  question is how long are you gonna keep eating shit  youre 70 years old how many years you got left  my nephew running things  not thatstrunz not in this life  hey here let me schlepp that  you got any more in the car mm mm  how did you get in here liliana  she said to tell you that she left early  so what theyre sayin on the tv about the storm thats headed this way huh  yeah you want some coffee  only if youre makin it  father dont start that  no really i mean its practically the cocktail hour anyway   would you rather have a glass of wine  how about a lillet  you in the mood  just came to check on you guys see how youre holding up with these indictments  were hangin in oh  so what we were talking about a few months back  think any of these recent developments have brought tony any closer  to reexamining his life  making some hard choices i told her she was not to use my card again  no thats mine  one true thing just out on dvd  i was over at video one anyway i thought maybe  you might want to take your mind off these stressors  you want to stay for dinner   something wrong carm  just tell me so i know how many steaks to defrost   tonys not gonna make it  well if  you know as i was saying my real concern for tony  father he doesnt give a flying fuck  you know it and i know it at least for the foreseeable future  then thats even a bigger reason to hes a sinner father  and you come up here and you eat his steaks  and you use his home entertainment center carmela  the dvd is for you really even after just last week i told you  im not a big renee zellwegger fan you did  i i dont remember that you wanna watch one true thing fine  at least admit it  i d i thought you liked movies mea culpa  jesus you know i get exactly the same who me shit with tony  two i dont need  has tony thought about changing father please  you do think im a schnorrer dont you  a a a parasite  i asked you that before and you denied it but clearly thats what you think  no you know what i think father  i think that you like the i dont even know what to call it  the uhwhiff of sexuality that never goes anyplace  i had feelings for you carmela i admitted it  its my job to deal with them so i can  carry on my pastoral duties  how does rosalie aprile fit into your feelings for me  oh so thats it  i really appreciate everything that youve done for me father phil truly  the religious counselling the book on buddhism  the wonderful chats i am very fond of you  more than fond  but i think you need to look at yourself  call this an intervention  because i think you have this m o where you manipulate  spiritually thirsty women  and i think a lot of it is tied up with food somehow  as well as the sexual tension game  whoa  oh mr soprano your wife found you
