why would you do that the prozac seems to be working  well that might be the problem it might be workin a little overtime  what do you mean  umm   im havin a uh  reaction  you know a side effect from the stuff  we talked about that when you started  some people get insomnia  others a stomach ache or headaches   but it usually passes  are there any other side effects that you know of  some people experience a diminished libido   they have a hard time getting or maintaining a  bingo  i see mm  you know not all impotence is a result of the medication  you sayin theres somethin wrong with me  whens the last time you had a prostate exam  hey i dont even let anybody wag their finger in myface  im sorry i shouldnt have laughed   dont apologize  oh boy   you got a nice laugh  all right lets be serious  hey im serious  you know that depression is also a leading factor in impotence  when you awaken in the morning or in the middle of the night do you ever have an erection   you could set your

respect to new york  i dont think you should be tellin my uncle how to run things  you think i got the balls to drive in from new york  and tell your uncle how he should run his family  i shouldnt expect to see the statue of liberty again if i did that huh   all right look tony   hesh isnt only a friend of you guys hes a friend of ours  somebody has to step in so he doesnt get fucked i never said fucked  and you frankly im a little hurt you shouldve come to me first   airin your dirty laundry in public  junior knew how i felt  how would it look if i went to you after i spoke to him hes got a point  bottom line is whatre we gonna do about this  somethin tells me you have a suggestion  junior if therere any flies on you theyre payin fuckin rent  five hundred is a little steep for back taxes no  as far as two percent of his action thats up to you to settle  after all that affects tony as much as hesh  im not out to hurt anyone  god forbid i get in the way of someone earning  lets

sex no  go back to sleep  you know you have a nice body you ought to make it work for you more  oh really you reveal too much  you dont want other men looking at me  no when youre not with me you do what you want  but im sayin maybe you could wear a nice businesslike outfit  i think i could get into that  you want me to dress like a man no  no you fuckin wack a doo i dont want you to dress like a man  im just sayin maybe wear somethin a little more professional  you know like youre in business fuck you im no whore  no thats not what i mean not like youre in the whore business  oh forget it  come here  is everybody in my life bananas or what  get over here  come here go jerk off  yeah go jerk off  look at this she burned me  thats not good  what led up to that  carmela can be pretty violent sometimes  this added problem that ive been havin that we talked about  i just thought that maybe we needed to spice things up a little bit you know  if its not the prozac  then maybe i just needed a little jump start  so i suggest to her that maybe she dress a little differently  something titillating yeah you know maybe itd help  so i suggested to her  not demanded  suggested  you know maybe dress a little sexier  but carmela can be very sensitive  maybe she felt it degraded her  not all women are into sexy lingerie  im not talkin about dressin like that  then what are we talking about  some women are sexier when they dress simple  you know understated  i dont mean  fuck it i dont know what i mean  like you  how like me  you play it down  now its obvious you got a killer body under there dont get me wrong  all right  not only do you play it down  but youre gentle  not loud  sweet sounding  like a mandolin  anthony  its unfortunate that we have to stop now  because i think its really important we talk about this  do you think you could come back later this afternoon  no  till tuesday  okay  yeah all right  see you tuesday  oh motherfucker  ow  shit  its the oddest thing ive had this problem for weeks  but this morning i get in and it starts right up   and then again at the deli  uh looks fine  are you sure i was told i need a new starter  lady as much as i might wish

earner  during the football season he moved more cards than ten guys put together  and another thing a certain friend of ours shouldve checked with me  before he did a favor for the old man capri  youre losin me irish was the one who sold capris grandson that shit  i think you created a fuckin frankenstein in junior  i created  we all agreed to let junior have his day  let him be the lightning rod when lightning strikes god forbid and somebody goes down  its not a young man with a family remember   we all agreed  yeah but who expected to get raped  when jackie was acting boss no one minded cause it all evened out at the end of the day  but your uncle marone doesheeat alone  he doesnt even pass the salt heh heh  what about that sammy grigio card game  that fuckin mikey smacked him around that aint right  come on jimmy even a broken clock is right twice a day  junior was right he had a position that game wasnt payin anybody  the minute sammy grigio used jimmys name it shouldve been end of story   thats right   what do you want me to do we made our bed we sleep in it were all men  but how long we gonna continue to kick upstairs without it hurtin  i mean something anything should

lady finds me  you want coffee  yeah all right bring my cookies  carmela i dont want to sound like  religion is a cure all  but i think if tony got more involved with the church  it may help to expedite things in his therapy  whats killing me is this is a self inflicted wound  i pushed for it  i could deal with thegoomahs i knew i was better than them  as stupid as it sounds i viewed them as a form of masturbation for him  i couldnt give him what he needed all the time  youre a man father you know that thirst  i was too busy with the house and kids to quench it  but the psychiatrist you know shes not just agoomah  for the first time i feel like hes really cheating  and im the one whos thirsty  im not gonna stay in a marriage thats made shh shh  lets not even think about that  divorce is for the weak  for people who never intended on dying married in the first place  you know carm we reap what we sow  what do you mean  you admit to accepting his dalliances in the past they meant nothing to tony  but you said it was like they were lightening the workload  providing a wifes duty when you were too busy with the kids and the house  you practically welcomed it  i want you to pray to our holy mother  ask her for guidance and forgiveness  so that you can get through this as a couple  youre not without sin in this carmela  shes outta control shes spendin money like were the sopranos of park avenue  but youve noticed her which may have been the point  look before we run out of time  id like to discuss what happened when we were here last week  hows your car  did you steal my car and have it fixed  we had an agreement no gifts  i didnt want to see you get robbed  it was you you had no right to steal my car   ive been scared to death  why  its a violation of my privacy what else have you done  answer me  i love you  anthony im in love with you  im sorry thats just the way it is  okay let me talk no its not the prozac  i dream about you  i think about you all the time  i cant get excited about any other women  theres nothing else to say  i love you let me start here  i know this may be very hard for you to swallow  but youre only feeling this way because weve made such progress  what ive been gentle thats my job  i listen thats what i do best  ive been a broad generic sympathetic woman to you  because thats what this work calls for  youve made me all of the things you feel are missing in your wife  and in your mother  youre makin me out to be some fuckin mamas boy  im a man and youre a woman  end of story  and this crap about freud and every boy wanting to have sex with his mother  thats not gonna fly here  i didnt say that  i want to make sure we understand each other  yeah we understand each other  you dont love me  you dont want me to come back any more fine  its quite the opposite  this is all a byproduct of progress  has someone been following me  okay forget it  ill see you next week  all right lets go  move it remember when you used to tell me  i always thought you could make the pros you coulda done it you had a swing like joe di  youre crazy what you think im shittin you  yeah i could barely hit 250 thats because you didnt want it  too busy chasin skirt chasin skirt your average was 500   yeah what happened  so what is it you want to talk about  octavian you know augustus  you fuckin with me no octavian became augustus  forget about that bottom line  augustus was a caesar and everybody loved him right  you know why i dont know that i give a fuck  everybody loved him cause he never ate alone  capisci it was the longest time of peace in romes history  he was a fair leader and all his people loved him for that  this the one that they stabbed in the back no that was julius  im talkin about augustus he shared his wealth and all his people loved him  you said that three fuckin times i heard ithis people loved him whats your point  remember the story you told me about the father bull talkin to the son  theyre up on this hill theyre lookin down on a bunch of cows  the son goes to the father  dad why dont we run down there and fuck one of these cows  you remember what the father said  father says son why dont we walk down there and fuckem all  i told you that yeah  why dont we fuckem all  thats funny  okay i get your point why dont you just come out with it  instead of all this augustus octavian

 junior took the 250 you gave him and whacked it up amongst the top five guys  you know so he doesnt look greedy smart move  yeah your uncle may turn out to be another harry truman  whats that mean truman had a big job thrust upon him  he didnt want it but in the end he made some pretty wise decisions  so who knows your uncle may turn out to be the right man for the job  i fuckin hope so cause ill tell you right now i dont want the fuckin job  let junior die from the stress  its what gave jackie the cancer god rest his soul  boss fuck it who needs it   its nice here  i cant stand the smell
