up dead  what are you saying here  hes a twofaced fucking prick   i thought ralph was your friend  right thats rich  did you hear what my friend said about my wife  he made a crack about ginnys weight  something about her having a 90pound mole on her ass  well thats  thats deplorable  who told you this   whats important is that it was said  lf he did say it i didnt hear it  cause he knows better than to make a remark like that when im around  shes fighting a weight problem since the kids were born  weight watchers richard simmons fasting   she works very fucking hard  youre telling me how hard it is  its different for women body image selfesteem  ill tell you though  i never had a problem with ginnys weight  to me shes beautiful  rubenesque  that woman is my life  to think shes being mocked  all right look john  im not gonna sit here and deny that ralph can be a fucking asshole  and that was a horrible thing to say  but even if it was said you cant be serious about him winding up  you know  shes the mother of my children  i know she is john  at least hear ralph out  how long we go back  all of us  the kid last night  he was laughing  about this  i dont know  all right youre

will be there  now here you see  except in cases of demonstrable fraud  transfer of title is binding once the grantee registers the deed with the county clerk   some people say college only serves to show grad schools  who managed to show up somewhere four years in a row  but volunteering at the law center actually allows you to make a difference  last year with our help  over a half a dozen crack babies were reunited with their natural mothers  several of whom are now in recovery  eventually with the help of aclu attorneys  youll be filing court papers and helping with legal research  theres a signup sheet and some fliers if youre interested thanks  thats so true what you said about college being an audition for grad school  so much for higher learning living in the moment  check out the law center theres some really cool people there  there were 15 guys at the dinner when ralph told that joke   could be anybody flapping their gums  what i dont get is why  whats the upside of telling johnny that   get in good with new york somehow  loose lips sink ships  first john knows about flipping the property by the esplanade now this shit  how about patsy  hes had issues maybe hes holding a grudge  you really think hes that cagey   albert then  wait a minute  what if vesuvios bugged and the fucking feds told johnny   conspiracy theories now  why not  create a little dysentery among the ranks  first of all the place is swept once a week  as for the feds theres more interesting shit being talked about in there  besides ginnys fat ass  sil the liquor inspectors here  what do you think   its not possible right  silvio talking to johnny  you never know t  jasons always been a welladjusted young man  so why now elliot  three years at bard and suddenly now as a senior this epic drift  no focus no drive  hes actually talked about dropping out and joining the forestry service  well some people thrive on solitude  senior year  theres something about the light at the end of that tunnel that can be very frightening  saskias a senior is she going through any of this  sask has always been highly motivated kenahora  wheres richard in all this anyway  jason barely speaks to him anymore   since when  right after the rape  jason may be feeling guilty himself jen  hes powerless to avenge you  and resents his father for the same shortcomings  hey george hamilton  hows the back  oh the

my words not good enough  not if you want him clipped over it  he said  she was having a 90pound mole removed from her ass  the implication was her ass is so big  she could have a mole that size

out he acted all weird i cant believe i actually kissed him once  his mother tells me hes having a rough time of it  jen please im sure shes overreacting  apparently hes talked about dropping out  hes okay but jason is like the clichd psychiatrists kid  slightest bump in the road he knows exactly what to say to get attention   there any of that crumb cake left  counter  whats all that  im consolidating some bills  maybe you dont care about our future tony but i do  where do you get that i dont care   i met with your cousin  yeah you met with brian  you sat there eating cake and making wisecracks  its boring to me okay  you gonna cry now   what the hell is wrong with you  when you ignore me tony  when you trivialize things that are important to me  like this familys financial security it makes me feel unloved  thats your problem right there because you equate love with money  you equate love with money   is it safe  we each got a new cell phone  talk on it once you toss it totally untraceable  its what the taliban used to do  lets get started  my daughterinlaws coming here with the baby later   hello  ls he there  yeah ton  okay youre all set   just talk into there

pick up sophia  junior can we do this already  yeah right  johnny and ralph cifaretto right   ralph insulted johns wife  thats correct   whos on the wire now  lts john corrado  so what did ralph do exactly  he made a very hurtful remark its not worth repeating  its not important lets just agree it was unkind  lets point out too  that its only been alleged something was said  he allegedly said what he said to a group of people friends of ours  if you werent there how do you know its true   im not at liberty to say  al due respect but this is bulshit  somebody in my familys talking out of school  and youre not at liberty to say who i should be making the beef here  my nephews right  lets stick to the issue a horrible insult was made against ginny   end of fucking story  what does he want done about it  i want to avenge her honor as is my right to do  all right fine  you tell me who told you about it well bring him in here  he corroborates what youre saying ill give you ralph on a platter  is nothing sacred  i mean this is my wife were talking about here  if this were years ago would i even have had to ask  i mean what happened to this thing  for gods sake we bend more rules than the catholic church  al right look  lets assume for the sake of argument  ralph said what you think he said   is clipping him gonna unring that bell  nobodys getting clipped  i want satisfaction   will you accept an apology  that ship has sailed  youre being unreasonable  ralph cifarettos the only one who can handle the esplanade   put pontecorvo in there  there are millions of dollars at stake   again with the money  yeah again with the money  its settled john  so either name a price or get the fuck over it  what would you say to a piece of ralphs company  just think about it at least  hello  its me what are you still asleep  no i was doing something  l took john to dinner last night  ralphs got a big problem kid   i thought you squashed it  l did  problem is i dont know if johns hearing me   what are you gonna do about it  me  nothing   what does that mean  i didnt say nothing  we share the esplanade tony  l dont want that apple cart upset  then somebody should do something about it  i appreciate your thoughts   you saying what i think youre saying  i didnt say nothing  all right then ill talk to you  twenty years ive been friends with john now hes gotta go  all over a stupid joke  i was fucking around for christs sakes  youve never made a joke about ginny sack   not like that  of course not  fuck him and his highfalutin bullshit  who does he think he is sir walter raleigh  thats enough of you and your stupid fucking remarks  go back to miami and play volleyball whatever the fuck you do down there  while we clean up your fucking mess  maybe even keep your ass alive  a mole on her ass  whats the joke i still dont get it  its not a joke per se its  you had to be there  real lack of standards your generation  my day john was right  a man wouldnt be expected to stand for such a remark  fucked up thing is i dont even like ralph  if he was drowning id throw him a cinderblock  but not protect one of my own captains  besides its too late anyway   carmine gave me the nod  on johnny  that ones a slippery fuck  him and those big fishlips of his  look at this  the fifth question and the poor prick used all his lifelines  john goes  carmines gonna position himself for maximum deniability  so you make it easy for everybody take it out of the neighborhood   what like an accident  accident stickup  he could choke on a chicken wing  the important thing johnny disappears  with johnny out carmines gonna put his son in there  fucking brainless ii  who knows maybe theres an upside to johnny going  he goes to boston a lot to visit his father  could happen up there  you want my advice youll call lou dimaggio  the atwell avenue boys  what those sick old fucks in rhode island  they may be old my little nephew but those dogs can still hunt  my old man used to talk about them  something to do with drugs  heroin  back in the 50s it was raining cash with that shit  dimaggio and his crew never saw a dime  the guy they worked for lenny caputo he didnt believe in it  for 15 years  everyone and their mother was getting rich dealing h  everyone except these guys  theyre eking a living doing hits running swag  anyway lo and behold one day  lenny gets pinched for heroin trafficking  it turns out the cocksuckers been making a fortune  working with the mulignon and not only that  hes been selling out his own guys to the feds  so he can keep his ass out on the street  dimaggio and another guy in his crew did eight years on a murder rap  so much for loyalty  you go to rhode island and whatever you do dont mention drugs  coke heroin not even tylenol  so what happened to this lenny prick  lou dimaggio his real name is galina  they called him dimaggio when lenny and his wife were found  with their heads bashed in by a baseball bat  anyway

shouldnt have gone down into that garage that late at night  i went to see sask at school the other day  and im in the parking garage over there  i was driving around for 20 minutes  when finally i spot someone leaving this big bluto sort of guy  i must have crowded him as he headed for his car  anyway he turned around  and became quite confrontational  and for a second ill admit i thought of you  what are you getting at  parking garages are not inherently dangerous places  you cannot blame yourself for what happened to you  turns out this guy was probably another parent  or more likely a repairman  but if he had dragged me out of my car and beaten me up  would i be saying gee i shouldnt have tried to park my car  anyway enough about him lets get back to you  you wanted to see me  you can tell ralph ive decided to accept his apology  you know that kid you pissed on donny k  hes got fucking nerve damage on his left side  im sorry tony  i bet you are  ill expect to hear from ralph
