  alright so i cheat i used to cheat  im not getting spayed end of subject  you brought up the vasectomy  now you dont want to talk about it  you asked me what was going on  i saw in the news about a gangland shooting  yeah  is that your nephew christophe that youve spoken of before  in the papers they said he was in critical condition  hes gonna be fine  have they found the person that shot him yet  no have you  im not trying to pry into that part of your life  i know our deal  but ive heard you say before that you love this young man  christopher was  clinically dead for about a minute  he thinks he had one of those near death experiences  says he visited hell  and they told him hed be back permanent  whos they  its bullshit it was a dream  combined with the morphine  but now he thinks hes gonna go to hell when he dies  hes all fucked up over it  do you think hell go to hell  no  hes not the type that deserves hell  who do you think does  the worst people  the twisted and demented psychos  who kill people for pleasure  the cannibals the degenerate bastards  that molest and torture little kids  they kill babies  the hitlers the pol pots  those are the evil fucks that deserve to die  not my nephew  what about you  what  hell  you been listening to me  no  for the same reasons  were soldiers  soldiers dont go to hell  its war  soldiers they kill other soldiers  were in a situation  where everybody involved knows the stakes  and if youre gonna accept those stakes  you gotta do certain things  its business were soldiers  we follow codes  orders  so does that justify everything that you do  excuse me let me tell you something  when america opened the floodgates  and let all us italians in  what do you think they were doing it for  because they were trying to save us from poverty  no they did it because they needed us  they needed us to build their cities and dig their subways  and to makeem richer  the carnegies and the rockefellers  they needed worker bees and there we were  but some of us didnt want to swarm around their hive  and lose who we were  we wanted to stay italian  and preserve the things that meant something to us  honor and family and loyalty  and some of us wanted a piece of the action  we werent educate d like the americans  but we had the balls to take what we wanted  those other fucks those other  the j p morgans they were crooks and killers too  but that was a business right  the american way  that might all be true  but what do poor italian immigrants  have to do with you  and what happens every morning you step out of bed  what the fuck is this all of a sudden  im just asking a question  oh so youre taking a stand here now  huh you pick here to make a stand  after all this time  telling me that nothings my fault  because of poor parenting  you pick now to act like betsy fucking ross  when my nephews in the fucking hospital  he might not get out  what what  quiet  my wind chimes  sorry hon  dont wake up my kids paulie  motherfucker  baby you gotta relax your thoughts  whatever christopher saw you cant take it personal  christophers a troubled kid  who knows whats in his heart  come  youre right  i need to relax with this  let me help you  that is so weird  what the fuck you saying   kenny and i were supposed to be married at 100  in the fountainbleu room at the roman gardens  mikey and jo jo had the bella vista room booked for 300  but the bella vista room is smaller and has no windows  a week before the wedding  mikey saw the bella vista room and flipped out  he almost killed the events manager  so mikey and jo jo got the fountainbleu  and kenny and me wound up in the bella vista room  at 300  fuck  just trying to tidy up the place  go back to sleep  tidying up  how you doing  im doing  ill tell ya  im still baffled by this 300 thing though  i wish i had more for you paulie but thats all he said  let me ask you a question  yeah  that bouncer that sent you back  did he have horns on his head  no  he was just some big irish goon in old fashioned clothes  did anybody there have horns  or buds for horns those goat bumps  paulie it was fucking hell okay  my father said he looses every hand of cards he plays  and every night at midnight  they whack him the same way he was whacked in life  and its painful night after night  does that sound like fucking heaven to you  was it hot  yeah i dont know  what the fuck  the heat wouldve been the first thing you noticed  hell is hot  thats never been disputed by anybody  you didnt go to hell  you went to purgatory my friend  i forgot all about purgatory  purgatory  a little detour on the way to paradise  how long you think we gotta stay there  thats different for everybody  you add up all your mortal sins  multiply that number by 50  then you add up all your venial sins  and multiply that by 25  you add them together and thats your sentence  i figure im gonna have to do about 6 000 years  before i get accepted into heaven  and 6 000 years is nothing in eternity terms  i could do that standing on my head  its like a couple of days here  was i insensitive  and perhaps did i do it deliberately  do i hate him  how often are you taking the ativan  almost every night  and when else  sunday afternoon i took one  theres another thing ive  ive been drinking  alone  im glad youre telling me  part of it is that im afraid  ive told him my son is at bard  why did you agree to continue working with him  i took him back because i felt it was  a professional and ethical responsibility to do so  jennifer im not challenging your ability  or professionalism  or even your ethics  then what are you challenging  what you hope to achieve with this man  what do you hope to achieve with me  no thats a  a facile analogy  im living in a moral never never land with this patient  not wanting to judge but to treat  but now ive judged  i took a position goddamnit and im scared  i feel for you  youre late  does that go on my record  im talking about common courtesy here  i got a life outside of this too  lucky you  so what do you got  i think he knows  knows what  or at least suspects  who what what are you talking about  hes been looking at me different these glances  glances  we had sandwiches brought in the other night  four with ham salami cappicola  one eggplant and the other with tomato and mozzarella  yeah okay  thats six total there were only five of us  but tony said he ordered the eggplant but i did  and i know for certain he ordered the tomatomozzarella  maybe he forgot  no no he never forgets  so whats the bottom line  he let me eat the eggplant and he took the tomato  but there was a moment  a glance  yeah a fucking glance  this is simple and im gonna help you out here  you gotta keep in mind that youre the one whos different now  youre the one seeing through different eyes  youre the one with the new attitude  i know the man and i see hes the one whos different with me  the odds dont favor it  either way it doesnt matter  to you  i wasnt the one selling heroin okay  and i wasnt the one who got pinned for it  so what do i do  what do you do  you do everything you can do do  do what you do to a girl that you want to fuck  make him love you  ill be back first thing in the morning  what do you want for breakfast  you dont wake up till lunch ma  tomorrow ill get up early alright  how about

minutes ago  the painkillers arent helping  no theyre pretty fucking good  i want to tell you something christopher  the other night when your heart stopped  i walked the hall to an empty room  and i prayed to jesus to spare you  and that if he would spare you  i asked that he grant you vision  sight  so that you can see the way to christ clearly  yeah so  and he did spare you  and you saw christopher  you saw something  something that none of us have ever seen  so what did he say to you  who  jesus  i didnt see jesus  tony said that you saw jesus smiling  and he took you to see your father in heaven  and then he said it wasnt your time  i was in hell carmela  you what  my father was in hell  and they said thats where id go when its my time  maybe it was purgatory but i dont know  then you have to look at this experience  as an opportunity to repent  to change your heart  to start to walk in the light of the lord  you were blessed by this christopher  you were blessed with a second chance  i dont know carmela  well i do know  and i am gonna pray like i did the other night  and im gonna pray every day from now on  it is not too late for you christopher  if you pray  will
