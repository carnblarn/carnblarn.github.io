italianamerican antidefamation organizations  okay   this thing gets on my nerves  dont get me started  well lets start with the idea of a parade for a genocidal colonial general  a national holiday no less   such festivities are deeply offensive to us  these are pretty broad charges  all know is italian americans are extremely proud of christopher columbus  admiral of the ocean seas and a great italian  you know very well of the compromised position we put forth  now if you people wanna make it an italian pride parade  we have no problem with that  western history says columbus discovered america  the same america that put your people in bondage for three centuries  but every culture has had to bear the pain  in the making of what i think we can all agree is a startling economic miracle   we cured polio  i have to agree with phil   the right to vote  exactly  take my grandparents  two simple people from sicily   who braved the perilous middle passage  middle passage  thats the term for the slave trade  montel the italian people in this country  also have suffered discrimination  earth to phil were talking 300 years of slavery here  enough  you okay tony you look a

weve both preserved the tradition of our ancestors  and managed to become new italianamerican women  such flair we have added to our image  and yet america still sees us  as pizza makers and mama leones  it is your job ladies to spread the word  our grandmothers may have been dressed in black  but were in moschino and armani  for those who say italian americans  eat smelly cheese and sip cold wine  tell them were from the land of aromatic asiago  and supple barolo  if they say spaghetti and meatballs  you tell them orecchiette with broccoli rabe   if they say john gotti you tell them rudolph giuliani   a princeton study showed that 74 percent  of americans associated italian americans  with organized crime  why would they do this  because of the way the media depict us  again it is our job to make sure people know  the other side of italianamerican culture  the educated wageearning lawabiding side  because isnt that who we truly are  thank you  thank you professor murphy  or should i call you professor longomurphy  longo as you dont call me late for dinner  small point  didnt i read about a more recent study at fairleigh dickinson  that found the opposite was true  that the great majority of americans  recognize these are fictional portrayals  were still looking at the sample selection criteria used in that study  well thanks for an excellent talk  and thank you all for attending today  dont miss professor murphys new book  strega the sorceress as imago figure in italian literature  and stick around for coffee and dessert courtesy of cocuzzos pastry shop  ill say

industry  shes the one who bears the brunt of insults  but there were many of us who were equally offended  i am sorry  this is an open forum you did hear me bring up that new study  if thats your idea of a good luncheon speaker  i suggest you think about who really keeps  this parish alive year after year  the size of your cities pain the eyes of the red man  a man in your cities is numb to

with another woman  which brings me back to my childhood  and my mother and my father  now were talking  where i had no love and no support  and where i was shamed and ridiculed for being artistic  in your relationship with these men  you have replaced your father with your brother  as a figure of authority that you need to prove something to  you set up these scenarios with these men  similar to your father and your brother seeking your brother  i e your fathers acceptance   the hell with them  i know  the work is to make new choices  that have nothing to do with old patterns  i want to sandy

 your teacher said that  its not just my teacher its the truth  its in my history book  so you finally read a book and its bullshit  you had to walk in columbus shoes to see what he went through  people thought the world was flat for crying out loud  then he lands on an island with a bunch of naked savages on it that took a lot of guts  you remember when we went to florida the heat and those bugs  like it took guts to murder people and put them in chains   he was a victim of his time  who cares its what he did  he discovered america is what he did  he was a brave italian explorer  and in
