of a far cry from the seltzer bottle and bicycle horn  im sorry  maybe youd like carmela to be here if im so fucking obnoxious  what im trying to establish is your response to sadness  is usually rage not humor  you two dont have to trouble yourselves because i doubled my dosage  i dont want you taking 80 milligrams of prozac  you kick it up to 80 for a week 10 days  just to pull back on the stick get the nose up  then you duck back down to 40 before the limp dick thing sets in  one thats ineffective  two its not a treatment for grief  lets get back to pieomy  its sad that youve lost something that you love  that being said   it is a horse  what the fuck is the matter with you  the only other time youve become this emotional in here   it was those ducks  that was a whole different thing   they were ducks  is it different  you havent grieved in this way for people  your mother your best friend  cant i just be sad for a horse without some touchyfeely  freudian shit component to it  when it was the ducks it embodied feelings of dread  about your family that something terrible was going to happen  its just the miserable way she died  it just makes me wonder what kind of fucking toilet

now even he smells a rat  if tony suspects one iota you know whatll happen to furio  these guys are living in a different century   it didnt stop you  steve at the gym  i felt so guilty all the time the lies and the sneaking  it took jackie going in the hospital to get me to stop   we havent slept together yet  youre not fucking him  so this isnt really real  it is real  we communicate  he looks at me like im beautiful  he thinks im interesting when i talk  just those few minutes when we see each other i live for those  i feel like my life is slipping through my fingers and i will never be happy  if you havent slept with him yet dont  and dont go over there anymore  were all here  good afternoon  for those of you who dont know me i am dominic  and im an alcoholic and an addict  dont forget scumbag   as some of you obviously dont know  ive also been in recovery now going on four years  i joined aa in prison and frankly it saved my life  okay now were all here today because we have one thing in common  not only do we share a certain background and culture  we care about chris and want to help him with his heroin addiction  any one of you been involved in an intervention before  caught our daughter smoking pot once but   not really no  no problem  an intervention is a nonjudgmental confrontation  a carefrontation we call it  now what i need from you guys is to make a list of specific times  where christophers drug use impacted on you directly  for example adriana is it  you would say something like this  christopher last monday you came home from work high  and belligerent and you were physically abusive to me   what if hes high when we try to talk to him  then we wait till hes sober  my first intervention steven patrano waited 10 hours for me to sober up   your first intervention  in 1997 i suffered a relapse  as in heroin addiction alcoholics suffer a fairly high recidivism rate  great so hes taking advice from a twotime loser  there are no losers in recovery  actually i never really met ralphs kid  i saw him once from a distance though  handsome boy  hes got a long struggle ahead of him thats for sure  doctors rehab  physical therapy  i think im going to have the medallions of veal  you make me late for a table at tavern on the fucking green  hows the real estate business   excuse me  you know hud  garside street you ralph zellman  zellman tell you this  carmine doesnt know anything about this yet  im giving you an opportunity to cut a deal make it right  last time frelinghuysen avenue i cut you in out of friendship but thats over  you got nothing coming to you you or carmine  you sure you want to go down this road  how much to paint a different suit on him change his face a little   pardon me  why throw it away  a stronger chin maybe  i was thinking like those paintings in the courthouse  something classy you know like a revolutionary war general  napoleon and his horse that kind of thing  hes rather portly to be napoleon  not napoleon exactly  like napoleon  sit down relax  whats going on ton  i think i know what happened to ralph and if im right  he aint coming back   it was new york  johnny sack  what was it the fat joke  im sure that didnt help  carmine  this hud thing were into they wanted a piece of it  i think they confronted ralph   things went sour  whatd he say john  wasnt what he said so much as what he didnt say  were talking about new york here  before we do anything in terms of a payback  you go to your people  i want a full investigation  nobody makes a move until we know what happened  you understand  what the fuck   whats going on  have a seat  im dominic i know you dont know me but  youre the guy who broke into stew leonards that time  you stole all those pork loins  yeah but thats not why im here today   were here to talk about your drug problem  what   jesus christ you fucking kidding me  sorry baby please  no fuck this shit  you were told once now sit down  sit down  ma jesus  this wont be easy for any of us  but i want you to know that were here today because we care about you   what was this your idea  all we ask is that you listen  adriana you want to begin  christopher

cant take it   be specific hon  when we first started going out we made love all the time   now because of the drugs   jesus is this fucking necessary  go ahead   you can no longer function as a man  last week when i came home to learn that you had killed our dog  that was the final straw   you killed the dog whatd you do that for   it was an accident  was it barking  he sat on her while he was high   jesus christ  i fell asleep  she got suffocated or something  are you done adriana  you killed little cosette  i ought to suffocate you you little prick  tony were going in order  when i came in to open up one morning  you had your head half in the toilet your hair was in the toilet water   disgusting   i told you i had the flu   i said my piece  great i cant even defend myself now   no ones attacking you  it doesnt change anything  but i can verify that he was sick for a little while  this thing with the dog how could you not see it on the chair  youre getting emotional  thats because i know what its like to lose a pet  i happen to know that you were high at my motherinlaws wake  you were talking nonstop for 20 minutes nothing but gibberish  my mothers wake  jesus christ
