                hows your mom ton  the same  but my ex goomars cousin  i got her coming in to take care of her  russian girl  who was it telling me about the bevilaqua kid  you know that family has money from construction  that fucking matthew  was never any good  he sure cried li ke a baby that night  i think the family was relieved he got taken out  what are you gonna eat  hey waiter  thats the closest cw 16 ever got tony  to discussing the bevilaqua murder on tape  i think at this point its time to consider   bonpensiero  was crucial to the webistics stock fraud case  so rico wise  the airline tickets  mail and wire fraud  especially if the mother testifies  in exchange for immunity  cmon whose own mothers gonna testify against him  i say focus on his garbage business  extortion  interstate trucking  its also the most likely to yield a prosecutable murder  richie aprile exactly  no doubt about it the cartel had him whacked  okay garbage but tony shows real due diligence  when it comes to electronic debugging  what about the home  bonpensiero told me him and tony talk in the basement there  on more than one occasion  his own basement really  wheres the due diligence there  tony avoids talking business in the house if he can  but if he has to hell take somebody out by the pool  except there he fears parabolics  the basement has these noisy a c ducts  he turns on the air and he feels its safe  surreptitiously enter said premises  and leave without notice  this is a sneak n peek warrant  correct your honor  i said you could enter the basement to drop a wire  i mean how many times do we have to impact  this familys right to privacy  first when the home is empty  we enter to take sound levels  determine where to best place the wire  once thats decided  the listening devi ce will be fabricated  and we will reente r to install it  see that they limit both entrances to the basement only  its not a better homes and gardens tour  happy hunting  the coffeemakers gotta be plugged in for it to work  same time as yesterday  listen ill save you some gas  im just going down to the stationary store  then ill be right back  you dont gotta follow me like yesterday  alright
