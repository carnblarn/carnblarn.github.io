the music business  and heres richie this musician who you know  theyre not a hair band anymore and theyre really good  you said yourself how much money there was in this thing  you mean like uh richie santini  you think massive genius would be interested  its a whole different thing black  but hes got a company massive g productions  shit they make movies even  massive does owe me a favor  im arranging a sit down for him with hesh  i was thinking about okay  i know this sounds kind of funny  music management  huh and working here  i have met people important people  learned people skills had to deal with big egos  solved problems  and with my love of all kinds of music  maybe alec baldwin would come to our house  you know who we are you know what we do  were comin to defile defile you  stay out of our way and dont be so gay  were comin to defile defile you  my y y lord   its just an old demo  no you know what  fuck it lets set you up  what i got money  youre right with how much you listen to the radio youd be good  i cant believe it but i get to pick what you wear  dress you up i like that  this place has the flava that gelding  name is sidney  so how come you never wrote a song about him  when you and little jimmy were writing partners on all his hits  did you write the music and him the lyrics or the other way around  we uh we had our own process  so that ooh wacka do wacka dooley do im so blue  that spring from your experience or the little brothers  one could write a song about a horse  but in order for it to be a hit with your target audience  hed have to have a mounted cop on him and ripped up the ass with a mac ten no  so you bought horses with your royalties  and little jimmys royalties whatever became of those  he bought horse  music business back then we were breaking all the rules  makinem breakinem as we went along  you mean rapin and pillagin  things havent changed much huh  were we hard nosed yeah  but we gave a lot of kids their start a lot of negro youth  tookem out of the ghetto kids with talent putem on the stage  herman ordinarily id be more than happy  to stroll down memory lane with you  but its reparations that i seek  why dont we call this what it is a shakedown  your own father was a silent partner in f note records  made sure that the records got airplay isnt that right  yeah that money built my house on the jersey shore  what do you want to do hesh im guided by you   hes got to do the right thing thats what  ohh  hey youre way our of line kid  lets get some cold fucking fizzy water on your head  thank you jen lets get right to the point huh  whats in this for you  if you read chuck ds book  you know he advises that reparations be made  by the jewish studio moguls in hollywood  on account of the way black folks have been portrayed in film  now thats only germane to this argument inasmuch  as i feel that the grievances in the music business are far worse  youre talking to the wrong white man my friend  my people were the white mans nigger when yours were still  painting their faces and chasing zebras  and as far as louie b mayer is concerned what are you fucking nuts  my lawyers have done a little research  i think that the final figure is somewhere around  four hundred thousand dollars  now a cashiers check made to mrs idella willis  will set the record straight  or what  what was it that she called him  oh yeah  that nice man i think she said  so hows your neighbor the one with no neck  the sopranos well theres a new car in the driveway every other week  but besides that  he gave me a gift of some excellent cuban cigars   and you accepted them  mmm hmm  see eroding the neighborhood values  he was thanking me for referring him to a physician  which hes very happy with  really  what does that do to property values  having a gangster living next door  are you kidding safest block in the neighborhood   and bein a gangster what does that mean anyway  yeah thats true  some of the shit i see in the boardroom i dont know if id make a distinction  oh will you please its not the same thing  bugging bribes i dont know  sometimes i think the only thing separating the american business from the mobs  is fuckin whackin somebody  listen to you whackin what  he hangs around with tony soprano for 15 minutes  and its fuckin this and fuckin that  we were over there for that fund raiser  i didnt see any guns anywhere  oh but that bar with the goombah murano glass  i like murano glass  those monte cristos  what do you say after dinner  just jaded tired and bored  right or wrong
