you into 10 pieces  usually they just engage whats called threat behavior  thatscause they did all their mauling  now all they gotta do is give you the look  you know h ow the primates  they groom each other  that i like  whats this  its a tibetan talisman for protection  i knew it i knew there had to be something  what  what is wrong with that  its a buddhist symbol  my sister was a buddhist shes a whackjob  ah i see so i gott a be a whackjob too  well it is a little wacky  whats wrong with fuckin catholicism  oh which you fuckin practi ce every fuckin day  im sure  so i pray a little bit  and i meditate in the morning  it clears my mind and my heart for the day  a buddhist selling 150 000 cars  the first noble truth is  life is suffering  but the buddha preached joyful participation  in the sorrows of the world  so you make a sal e you dont make a sale  its a tiny little thing  whats so funny  you came here today  what the zoo  i saidzoo and you came  this is a fuckin head trip now  huh nice  sorta  i dont like that  youre very sweet  you came  im crazy about you  you know that dont you  ive never met anybody like you  okay class come on come this way  stay together kids come on  were gonna see some tigers  you all remember yesterday  you take your ki ds to the bronx zoo  yeah  and now were here  see ya later  who was that  oh that was my hard on  oh  between the buddhism and talk about the family  poor you  let me see if its really gone  you lie  you know snakes can fuck themselves  give me your hand  oh jesus christ  dont move  what  see  if you  cannot  so what happened  he was at the crazy horse  and some zip he told my man here  new management new rules  so i asked around heard about some guy  multi something  some made guy in the soprano family  was runnin g things now  i gowhoa  chris moltisanti  yeah thats the name  i know chris  whats you r name again  matush  normally i woul d never get involved with a stranger  but if carlo here is vouching for you  im willing to make an exception  and take care of it  thank you  whatd i tell you about my man jackie  you know who my father was  the golfer u s open  chris and me are associates  you got nothin g to worry about  ill call carlo in a couple of days  meeting over  verbum dei has a strict zero tolerance policy  in cases of vandalism  it is a policy that demands the immediate expulsion  of the offending student  i told him  you see  having said that in this case  after much deliberation and assessment  we have decided upon a suspended sentence  this consideration has only been arrived at  based upon anthonys academic performance  and his involvement in extracurricular sport  his academic performance  hes brought his gpa up to a c   so what is the punishment  we suggest and hope  that anthonys punishm ent be meted out parentally  so its not exactly zero tolerance  each child is special  thats a guiding principle of this school too  well what about detention  a lawsuit a few years back  forced us to eliminate our detention program  well hes off the football team right  no  studies done at harvard and elsewhere  have shown that boys have greater success  in avoiding the pitfalls of adolescence  when they remain committed to  and involved in sport  you better wipe that smile off your face  look i told him he wa s gonna be off the team  now i mean youre kind of  undermining  its not only skill that anthony has shown  on the football field  its leadership qualities as well  we feel that it would be against his best interests  and the teams  to sever his relationship with the squad  well if you think thats best  however and i cant say this strongly enough  if there is but one more infraction of our code  the sentence will immediately go into effect  and anthony will be expelled  do you understand this anthony  yes  you completely sold us out in there  whatd i do  they are not punishing him at all tony  and you went right along with it  i suggeste d detention  that whole thing was a disgusting charade  so that the fucking freshman football team  can win the big game  weve been waiting for years for him to get off the couch  this is good for him  oh please  we should keep thi s in the family  punish him at home  he aint getti ng off that easy  overall its been a good two weeks  what about the nightmares  none  i had a wonderful dream  where i lit the big torch at the olympics  what do you think that represented  well work has been good  my sales are way up  and my performance has been commended  by mercedes benz u s a  with a little plaque  whats going on with your social life  nothing  right now  but its okay  what im going to say is a little delicate  but i think its important  when you called me last week to cancel  i heard a mans voice  my car broke down  it couldve been the mechanic  i see  im a little offended th at you put it to me that way  offended why  well i dont pay you to be under your surveillance  how dare you  you came to me after attempting suicide  over the break up with barry  i ask you because youre under my care  i think its very unprofessional ofyou  to confront me this way  suicide is something i take very seriously  well the doctor in the e r said  it was only suicidal ideation  is he trained to give those diagnoses  my car broke down  fine  ill believe you  thank you  to the crazy horse buona fortuna  salut  the club business aint easy  ill t ell you that  with the bing  everybody only sees the glitz and glamour  nobody really know s what goes into it  theres a lot to deal with  i know
