anthony why dont you wait outside  hes suspended for three days  well at least let me pay for the wine  the theft of the wine is not just a crime against property  this is an affront to our holy sacristy  ive asked dr galani hes our school psychologist to join us  hes been keeping an eye on anthony meeting with his teachers  why dont you pick it up from there doctor  um hi  in many respects anthony is a normal healthy eighth grader  sister patricia his art teacher  thinks he shows strong skills and spacial orientation  but the thing is though and its not just this one incident  anthony sometimes has trouble following the rules  weighing consequences  at times doesnt think before he acts  and its thought that theres a good possibility  anthony could be a d d  a d d im sorry  attention deficit disorder i knew it  i always knew there was something well what is it  its an aggregate of symptoms  inattention impulsivity  sometimes although not always hyperactivity  of course to be sure well need to give him a thorough evaluation  all he needs is a whack upside the head  if hes got an illness its an illness right  youd hit somebody who was sick youd hit somebody with polio   you hit anthony  nobody gets hit in our house  not exactly my idea  i dont know what the worlds comin to if you cant do a little tarantella  on the kids every once in a while when they step out of line   so what happens now  hell be given a complete battery of testing  psychological behavioral medical  let me ask you a question  these other kids you keepin an eye on them are you testin them  the ones that arent named soprano  theres no immediate plans for that  we attend every child at verbum dei  according to his own special set of circumstances  and so what dowe as the parents do  nothin  oh no i mean anthonys misbehaved  he should be consequenced  its a crime  to suspend that child from school with all the money you give them  i bet that gym teacher shit a brick  when your little friend puked on his boots huh anthony   wanna encourage him  hey whatever happened to boys will be boys  he stole from the church they dont makeem any lower than that   what a loser  thats enough out of you  his father was the same way  i practically lived in that vice presidents office   could we not please  well you only remember what you wanna remember  yeah well i mustve had another son  who stole a car when he was ten years old  yeah he could barely see over the steering wheel  he was a hellion this one him and his little crew  they used to steal lobsters on the boats on the shore  and sellem for a buck a piece down on bloomfield avenue   really  how many times do i gotta say this  i dont want that kind of talk in front of this kid   that stuff is wrong and i dont condone it  yeah sure   who do you think youre yellin at  what   you stupe  what did you just say   i didnt say anything  whats he doin now whats goin on   he yells at me like amiserable  anthony  i thought this could wait till after dinner but your father and i have talked  you are not to play mario cart or go skateboarding for three weeks  and no tv   no  youre not gonna sit on that internet either  every day you ride your bike to green grove retirement home and visit grandma   oh thatll be nice  its not fair  some fuckin day huh i feel like a bomb went off  all the stuff that doctor was sayin  i never saw any of that in anthony  you never noticed the way he picks at the tongue of his tennis shoe  like he cant help himself  if he even has this thing  somethings goin on  carm yeah  you think he knows i dont know  she knows   are you  really what makes you say that   are you in  i dont know  things she says she makes remarks like this today with him   are you in the mafia  she talk to youabout me  talk to me  did something happen on that college trip   happen    like what   i dont know she seemed peculiar when she got back  i think pretty soon were gonna have to you know  talk to her about the business  yeah the two of us should sit down with meadow  talk as a family  and with him theyll give him the tests and well see whats what  right  good night  good night  maybe i dont wanna admit theres something wrong with my kid  but this all sounds like bullshit to me  what do you mean if hes got a disease why do they tell me to punish him  doesnt that sound like bull a d d is a controversial subject  is it a disease or a way for these psychologists to line their pockets  many children can really benefit by professional intervention   he got in a little trouble  you dont consider his behavior out of the norm  no  i dont know  what do i know about it what do you mean  oh i gotta spell it out for you  do you see his behavior as a reflection of your own  look like i said maybe maybe i dont wanna admit theres something wrong  but you know if hes got this thing well deal with it  if he had polio wed deal with it  you pick up the pieces and you go on from there  so thats what were gonna do  do you have anything else you wanna say about this  well last time you were telling me you had intimate feelings for me  but youve not mentioned it  intimate feelins  i think i said i was in love  how are you doing with it  well  i just cant turn off my feelingscause you tell me its a byproduct of therapy  i never said you should turn off your feelings  well i already got a

how do you account for that  then you got leopold and loeb  they cornhole and murder this kid for fun  and their father was a successful businessman a fuckin millionaire  do you hold your father responsible for what youve become  yeah sometimes i think about  what life wouldve been like if my father hadnt gotten mixed up  in the things he got mixed up in  how life wouldve been different  maybe id be sellin patio furniture in san diego or whatever  we were talking last time about how you felt when you became aware  of your fathers criminal life  do you have any more thoughts on that  when you first started therapy you said  that you had this dream about those ducks  they flew away with your penis it was a bad omen  that something was going to happen in your family  is this the terrible thing  look if you know somethin please quit fuckin around  i think its important to remember  you said you liked the history channel  he who doesnt understand history is doomed to repeat it  lets talk about your father  my father   heads up   why are you smiling  just thinkin about my uncle  he used to throw the ball with me  the one with whom you have all the static  yeah  uncle jun  he

heart was broken  you felt your father was showing favoritism  i still remember that feeling in the pit of my stomach  did you confront them  have you been listenin to what ive been sayin  kids dont

janice as a front  all the guys brought their daughters  so that when they did their business it would look sweet and innocent  that must have been devastating  nah it turned out it was no big deal  to see your father handcuffed being led away by the police  well at the time i thought my head was gonna explode  he lookedhelpless  but when i got home my mother had a different perspective which made me feel better   so in her pain she reached out to you  thats one way to put it  your father may not be home for dinner tonight go wash up  i know what do you know  i saw him gettin arrested what did he do  he didnt do anything they just pick on the italians  still in my heart  i knew my father was no freedom fighter   so he went to jail  no he came home in a couple of hours  we were watchin

was little but they told me he was in montana bein a cowboy  what   my son is doomed right  why do you say that  come on this is the part  where im supposed to tell ya how terrible my father was  and the terrible things he did to me and how he ruined my life  but ill tell you somethin i was proud to be johnny sopranos kid  when he beat the shit out of that guy i went to the class  i toldem how tough my father was  do you think thats how your son feels about you  yeah probably and im glad  im glad if hes proud of me  but thats the bind im in cause i dont want him to be like me  he can be anything he wants to be  he could be like um this guy i knew in high school  his grandfather invented these little ties that go on the end of salamis  he made millions of dollars hes sittin on his ass  have you communicated any of this to your son  not in so many words  probably not at all  what difference would it make you said so yourself  its in the blood its hereditary  genetic predispositions are only that predispositions  its not a destiny written in stone people have choices  she finally offers an opinion  well they do you think that everything that happens is preordained  you dont think that human beings possess free will  how come im not makin fuckin pots in peru  youre born to this shit you are what you are  within that theres a range of choices this is america  right america  so livia what do you think  huh okies and misfits  thats who goes there losers  the beverly hillbillies so now rocco alatores a loser  i know ive had to rough rocco up because of money but the guys got a

real go getter  didnt dad wanna go with him your father  no yeah he did  i remember you guys talkin about it  alatore was gonna start a business dad was gonna do a little thing with him  oh well rocco just got him all worked up thats all  what is this with all these questions  dad wanted to go with him you wouldnt let him  let him mmm  what do you mean you just tell me  one time your father didnt do exactly as he wanted  i dont know  maybe this was his chance to get out  dad was no choir boy but maybe with a little bit of support  oh mr sensitive now  well if it bothers you maybe you better talk to a psychiatrist  whoa what are you talkin about a psychiatrist  well thats what people do when theyre lookin  for somebody to blame for their life isnt it  youre a real stone player arent you ma  you threatened to smother his children what does that mean  everybody thought dad was the ruthless one but i gotta hand it to you  if youd been born after those feminists  you woulda been the real gangster  i dont know what youre talkin about  hi hi please sit  i know youre probably eager to hear the results of our testing  hows anthony doing uh good i think dont you think so tony  yeah i think so okay  well good uh lets get to it  the good news is no evidence of learning disability  cognitive function verbal and nonverbal  intelligence testing arithmetic and reading evaluation  all within the normal range oh thank goodness  got a clean bill of health from his pediatrician  no soft sign on the neurological either  thats all the good news now why dont you tell us the bad news  well  as to whether anthony has a d d  the results were interesting  the a p a standard is for the subject  to manifest six out of nine possible symptoms of a d d  in testing anthony manifested five of those symptoms  five really  he often has difficulty awaiting his turn  is often on the go or acts as if driven by a motor  often interrupts or intrudes on others  and often fidgets with hands or feet  he fidgets with hands or feet  thats right  you mean like he fidgets  uh huh  and thats a sickness the fidget  mr soprano its one of nine possible symptoms  what constitutes a fidget   tony  no no what constitutes a fidget  so what if he fidgets hes in school who doesnt fidget in school  and he doesnt wait his turn the kids in puberty  he gets a hard on every ten minutes for christs sake   anthony is a borderline case  hold it hes not a case  hes a 13 year old boy thats the trouble with you people  every time you see a problem you turn it into a disease  hes a kid who made a mistake and hes gonna pay for it  but hes gonna be fine come on  frankly i think hes right  and i dont think we should have to pay for this testing either  to oppose this massive force bearing down on midway  admiral nimetts had no battleships in shape for the fight  however he had the carriers  yorktown enterprise andhornet  this might prove to be the trump card  you studying  government  its not the end of the world anth  im depressed  youre not depressed  youre sad and youre angry cause you did somethin stupid and you got grounded  and you cant watch tv or play on your fuckin computer for two and a half weeks  its gonna stay like that  it isnt fair  got that right  what are you doin whats it look like  can i have one too  this ones yours  gonna need sprinkles  okay  you want nuts yeah  mms  pretty good
