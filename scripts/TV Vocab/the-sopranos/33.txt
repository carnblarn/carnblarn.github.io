mean  you know angelo was dying to marry you  and now stamfas is a chain of drugstores  so what he doesnt need therapy  he prescribes his own tranquilizers  dont be so sensitive  what sensitive  i gotta hear this angelo stamfa shit again  all i was saying was  i know wha t you were saying  hugh bring your plate  you are blowing this all out of proportion  we worry about you thats all  spare me your concern alright  and spare me your attitude too  or maybe you forgot  dads little strip mall on route 17 was zoned residential  until tony made a phone call  bullshit  oh really dad  the contract

phone  ah  i just wanted to make sure it was okay if i came alone  i mean because tony couldnt make it  i love the artwork you have out there  those country scenes  thank you  that statue is not my favorite  oh come on  look its not lik e this when me and ton y are here together  you never give him the silent treatment  is that what you think  im giving you the silent treatment  maybe you could tell me why you came today  im worried about my husband  the mood swings  i thought  when his mother died maybe  but still half the tim e he doesnt even talk to me  youve seen him get like that  that day he sat here like a wall  i know that hes your patient  and i am only the patients wife  but you try living with that 24 hours a day seven days a week  see how you feel  i see  oh you do  well for your information  i am not the only one  the fact is tony isn t under the weather today  he just didnt feel like coming  fuck that shit i think he said okay  usually happens when we touch on a nerve  he was distressed about this young mans death  in the garbage compactor  see he didnt say garbage compactor did he  see  what is it you believe  you know about his job  he reports to a strip club  who knows how he spends his days  im sorry  im just frustrated thats all  tonys been out of sorts for so long  and there is  there is nothing i can do to help him  i think coming to therapy with him  has stirred up a lot of feelings in you  that you would like to address with somebody  oh please  im just a little emotional today  i would like to help you  but as youve pointed out your husband is my patient  im not the one who needs mental help  i just needed to vent  in case you change your mind  heres the number of a colleague in livingston  he was a teacher of mine  that really wont be

fall  see the large black marble wall  to the right of the entrance  ah yes  thats where the donor names will be inscribed  everybody who donates gets their name up there  the wall is reserved for people whose commitment  begins at the 50 000 level   its what the giving committee felt youd be comfortable with  based on your past generosity to the verbum dei school  you know what we gave to verbum dei  im half embarrassed to say it but its my job to know  all the information including tax benefits is in here  well i will have to talk to my husband   you gotta be kidding me  he talked an

so you can write him a check  and thats it  not a penny more  a five f u based regimen with cisplatin and doxorubicin  this is the treatment i would recommend  are you getting this  sort of  so the chemotherapy would be instead of the surgery  but i cant guarantee even that  well have to evaluate the results of the treatment  i could end up having the chemo  puking my guts out  having the six hairs i have left fall out  and still have to be cut again  im afraid thats a possibility  you see with kennedy you dont get these maybes and possibilities  yeah but you gott a have the surgery again  dr kennedy is an excellent surgeon  isnt there some way you people could just agree  sure  convene a tumor board  what the hell is that  a meeting of the chief of oncology  an oncological pathologist  and other specialists who then work together  to reach a consensus  then i guess you hea r what they have to say  well your uncle will not be present  they will pass their decision along to both of you  what you do then is still your decision  and kennedy will be there  i assure you no surgeon would miss it  not much to him if you ask me  what you mean hes not kennedy  you make life and death decisions  because of a mans name  its only sloan fuckin kettering  the best cancer hospital in the whole world  excuse me  and let me ask you something about this jfk worship of yours  what about

suck it up  the patient soprano comma corrado  male caucasian  presented three months ago with severe weight loss  and early satiety  he was scoped and a four millimeter mass  in the greater curvature of his stomach was detected  a ct scan revealed no evidence of metastasis  dr kennedy was referred in  and he recommended gastric resection for cure  there were no surprises  i thought we had it  i was told we had clean margins  often too little healthy tissue  was taken from around the tumor site  which leaves the possibility a s in this case  for a false negative  you want the mans whole stomach  if theres a problem with the procedure  well take it up on a board level  meanwhile what are we gonna do with this guy  hes high risk  his pressure fell below 60 systolic for eight minutes  on the table  the incisions still fresh  i can do it in half the time  if we dont do surgery we do 5 f u  which works how well on an adenocarcinoma  not very  which is why we decided to go in in the

could use a little extra distance  who couldnt  you know my uncle hes not doing so well  hes got a bad reaction to that chemo  that happens all the time  theres nothing that i can really do  you know there are worse things  that can happen to a person than cancer  my uncle think s hes gonna die  hes convinced ofit  you know how old people are with their superstitions  he thinks itsca use he went against you  i was his surgeon thats all  you got a bee on you hat  show that man the respect he deserves  answer his phone calls  cheryl make sure mr soprano is scheduled for  just rememberit  everybodys marriage has problems  is he seeing another woman  you can make that plural  yes he sees other women  i sort of lo ok the other way  i want to help him  do you  moments ago you used the word divorce  i said i was considering divorce  i may be overstepping my boundaries here  but you are jewish arent you  is that relevant  well us catholics  we place a great deal of sto in the sanctity of the family  and im not su re that your people  ive been married for 31 years  then you know how difficult it can be  hes a good man  hes a good father  you tell me hes a depressed criminal  prone to anger  serially unfaithful  is that your definition of a good man  i thought psychiatrists werent supposed to be judgmental  many patients want to be excused for their current predicament  because of events that occurred in their childhood  thats what psychiatry has become in america  visit any shopping mall or ethnic pride parade  to witness the results  what we say in here stays in here right  by ethical code and by law  his crimes  they are  organized crime  the mafia  oh jesus  oh so what  so what  he betrays me every week with these whores  probably the least of his misdeeds  you can leave now  or you can stay and hear what i have to say  youre gonna charge the same anyway  i wont take your money  thats a new one  you must trust your initial impulse  and consider leaving him  youll never be able to feel good about yourself  never be able to quell the feelings of guilt and shame  that you talk about  as long as youre his accomplice  youre wrong about the accomplice part though  are you sure  all i do is make sure hes got clean clothes in his closet  and dinner on his table  so enabler would be a more accurate job description  for you than accomplice  my apologies  so  you think i need to  define my boundaries more clearly  keep a certain distance  not internalize my  what did i just say  leave him  take only the children  whats left of them and go  my priest said i shoul d try and work with him  help him to be a better man  hows that going  i  have you ever read crime and punishment  dostoyevsky  its not an easy read  its about guilt and redemption  and i think were your husband to turn himself in  read this book and reflect on his crimes  every day for seven years  in his cell  then he might be redeemed  i would have to get a lawyer  find an apartment  arrange for child support  youre not listening  im not charging you because i wont take blood money  and you cant either  one thing you can never say  that you havent been told  i see  youre right i see  youre fucking poisoning me  i dont know how much more of this i can take  you taking good care of this young man  jesus dr kennedy  how you doing guy  i been busy you alright
