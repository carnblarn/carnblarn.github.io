this man dick  dont sit there and tell me  youre gonna take a bullet for some yuppie  who thinks youre his errand boy  your honor  this man should not be removed from custody for medical reasons  every time we get one of these elder mafiosos incarcerated  we get the same bag of tricks  your honor i take offense  to the characterization of my client as a mafioso  mr soprano has not been found guilty of anything  hes awaiting trial for alleged offenses  noted  with all due respect to the states medical facilities  in his condition mr soprano has every right  to pursue the best possible medical care that he can afford  mr soprano is suffering from a very benign illness  a few clogged arteries your honor  im leaning towards releasing this man from lock up  unless you can demonstrate a serious flight risk  mr soprano if i approve this  you will be under what is called house arrest  do you understand this concept  not really  it means that you must remain in your primary residence  and cannot leave  except for doctors appointments food shopping  your honor  the government asks for an electronic bracelet  your honor while we certainly agree to house arrest  we are asking that mr soprano not be further persecuted  for yet to be proven allegations  he shows no prior arrest since 1968  he pays his taxes  and hes a veteran of the second world war  mr soprano do you have any problem  with wearing an electronic bracelet  it sounds like nazi germany to me  obviously you need a history lesson sir  i dont think that we you and i  should let our shared sorrow or biases enter into this judge  hes wearing a bracelet  to avoid any risk of flight  who are you  jesus christ you scared the shit out of me  jesus aint got nothing to do with it  now what do you want here  looking
