 you know i ordinarily dont like to do this  but i got to call the cops  theres a potential shootout going to be happening  t in the trailer park tonigh  and im gonna call in the heavies   you know thats really unfair mr lahey  julians on probation  he could go back to jail for a really long time   julians on probation cyrus isnt  cyrus will kill me  you got any better ideas  if not put your shirt on and shut up    you know theres a lot of different personalities here  in this trailer park  r and every single person tries to respect each othe  except for cyrus  he has no respect for anyone but himself  and i dont really want to call the police in here  o and convince mr lahey not t  because i feel that in this community  we should be able to work things out ourselves   cyrus aint from the park  you know what i mean  round here its all for all and one for one   thats right   when a person aint from the park  they dont understand the way shit goes down  like the j to the roc like tyrone does my man here  you know what im sayin when your from the park  its all for one motherfucke r and one motherfucker  for all my fuckers everywhere you know wha im sayin   but if you come from outside the park you better watch out  cause you got a whole bunc h of park hustlers on your jock   got to stick together too its like a family   your jock dont stick together but the people stick together  thats the shit im talkin about   everyday mr lahey and i clean up this playground  shit its cyrus  dont you move  whats this i hear about you callin the cops huh  whats this i hear

definitely take care of the cyrus thing   its just that number one  were on probation  which is no big deal but you know  i dont really want to go back to jail  and number two or three or whatever number were on  im not going back to jail for julian  cause i dont even hang around him anymore   weve got to make a few things clear   sure  the two of us cant live  in this trailer park together now
