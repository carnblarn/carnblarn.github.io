some shit growing here and i cant fucking grow  that many tomatoes with what i got this is fucked   this has got to be the best idea ive ever had  think about it dope goes for a way more awesomer price in jail  supply and command i mean if youre in jail  youre lucky to get stoned once a week and when you do the dope sucks  i dont see anything wrong with having dope in jail  if theres dope in jail we may as well be supplying it   the thing that worries me right off the bat  is that their hydroponic vegetable garden  was just supposed to be  a small operation now the prison guards  are phoning every day looking for more and more dope   who can go fuck whos self no no  you shouldve been upfront with me and told me   yo yeah whats up  he wants twenty pounds   ricky sorry about that man  alright yeah everythings on schedule here alright  alright talk to you later   great   listen rick this is big alright  theyre selling the dope to ten other prisons across canada  they want it all upfront one shot one deal  if we cant do this theyre gonna find someone else to take this contract  we gotta do this man   julian gets an order for twice as much more dope and he thinks  he can just wave some money around and the magical fairy grandmother of dope  is gonna come and give us twice as much dope thats not going to happen   how are we gonna get the equipment i cant even afford  cigarettes or pepperoni same clothes for three fucking years   i know i know   rickys brain doesnt work like other peoples  ricky can handle one thought at a time  you throw two or three at him hes

chain came off   i understand why julian doesnt trust her she is laheys daughter  and we are opening up an illegal nightclub in the trailer park  which i dont think is a big deal but according to the police it is  and according to lahey it is and we are on probation and stuff so   youre not as bad as my dad says   yeah well your dads a bit of an idiot   somehow trina turned out pretty normal considering how fucked up  her father is and i feel bad for her and thats why  i try to be a bit of a role model for trina and the other kids  around the park if id had a role model when i was younger  learning how to grow dope things wouldve been a lot smoother  cause now if some kid wants to grow dope they can come and talk to me  instead of growing dope six or seven times through denial and error  theyre gonna get it right the first time and have some good dope  well not just that i can show them how to fix cars  play hockey or cutting grass  different things like that that youre not going to learn  from a fucked up father like lahey   i owe you one  actually  if you dont mind you could take those bottles back to the store  and get me two bags of chicken chips and the rest in pepperoni  thatd be cool  okay   and dont tell your dad about that either   no hes having his alone time with randy  thanks  thank you trina  chicken chips dont forget  pepperoni   alright guys lets
