for 28 days not a drop swear to god  i know that sounds crazy but listen randy ive been collecting evidence  videotape evidence  fortyfive hours on tape  corey trevor ricky and julian breaking the law  theyre back at my place   you can have them rand  you can make the bust if you do me one little favour  i need you to testify to my character at a hearing today  will you do that for me randy for an old friend  i dont think so mr lahey  i am truly disgusted at what a little bit of  power has done to corrupt my randy  i can only think of one other person in  the park that has any sort of conscience  bubbles  they very well could reinstate me  who knows maybe ill be patrolling sunnyvale again  oh yeah so then you can just fuck with us whenever you want  i dont think so mr lahey  bubbles if im reinstated youre going to see a new jim lahey  a new era of peace in sunnyvale i promise  i wont fuck over the boys anymore promise  are you prepared to put that in writing in a legal document  yeah  alright so these are the conditions  you agree to deal with randy  and calm him down  he thinks hes so fucking great these days  rays coming back to the park hes going  to be the assistant trailer park supervisor  and you agree not to fuck with the boys and let them grow dope  and sell to the guys in jail  alright bubbles  no no no  i want somebody to witness it  youre not tricking me  alright lets go  lets do it  this is what weve been working on right here   i was in charge of the lights the tube and the bed  im a lot taller so i was in charge of putting the reflective  surfacing up there on the ceiling and all the walls and the floor  this is going to be a huge surprise for ricky  i cant see how hes not going to absolutely love this  this is the best work weve ever done  great job boys  rickys going to be impressed with you guys  i gotta hand it to corey and trevor  they might be stupid but they did a great job in here  im proud of them  this is what i want you to do  get a hold of this guy fill the trailer up with weed plants  can you do it  yeah man thats easy  we can do this  i know this guy  i know you can do it  get back to work  love

work  okay so look i need you to sign here here here  initial here and sign her down there  sound of projector  mr lahey honestly wasnt drinking that night  i mean we threw liquor on him and  liquor got spilled on him a little later on  thank you barb  lights please  chief mr lahey could have chased us that night you know  but he knew we were just kids out having fun on halloween  and he didnt want us to get in any trouble  thats just the type of person mr lahey is  hes a hes a good man  okay i see  right  uh officer green you were the arresting  officer the night of the incident  yes sir i was  and it says here in your report that you came out to the scene  and you found that mr laheys squad  car was partially inserted into a trailer  and that mr lahey was in control of the vehicle  and that he was soaked in alcohol  thats correct chief and based on  what i saw i made the arrest  based on what you saw  okay based on what you saw  but you did not administer a breathalyzer  oh based on the situation at hand i didnt see the need  he pissed himself he was soaked in alcohol  george i told you and you can see it on the tape  liquor was inadvertently spilled in my groin area  he was your partner  you couldnt  give him the benefit of the doubt  he was my partner but he pissed himself  from what ive just seen it doesnt look like you were  doing your job very well officer green  it did not look like you were doing  your job yelling you pissed yourself  mr lahey do you have anything to add  i just want to say chief that all i ever  wanted was to be a good cop  before i was busted by my partner  i was a good cop you remember  you remember  even though i lost my badge i never stopped being a cop  well based on the evidence that ive seen and  based on the very powerful testimony from bubbles uh  i think that i really believe that an unjustice has been done to you mr lahey  and uh i feel that its only right and fair to reinstate you  as an officer of the law effective immediately  thats fine chief  jim lahey thanks you  officer lahey thanks you  yes  ted its randy   i got the evidence we needed  ricky  what are you doing with the gun out man  ive got to go see
