you forgot  he was a little boy who cried for help  because he said there was a wolf after him  each time the people of the village came running  and each time there was no wolf  eventually they got really tired of it  so when he calls for help cause theres a real wolf after him  nobody takes him seriously  nobody comes because nobody cares  do you see where im going with this jim   george i know it looks like im off the mark   listen what we have here jim is a shitwolf  do you know what a shitwolf is  you never seem to have  that crucial little thing called evidence  but each time you cry shitwolf and each time i come running  no more jim never again  now i want you to tell me what the moral of the story is   george  no say it jim  say it   never cry shitwolf    thats right now get
