business  and ricky and julians dope business collided  so the days here finally   basically the hardest part about dealing dope is transport  i mean i learned that back in grade 9  and julians got this plan  were gonna ship it around the province  in shoppingcart handles which is great  cause you got a shopping cart that looks perfectly normal  but inside the handle its full of hash   and it does help get rid of that hash  which i dont like lying around here  with lahey fucking wandering around  drinking fucking huge bottle s of liquor   pictou vocational school  they need hash   cobequid vocational school  shelburne port hawkesbury  fucking digby yarmouth everybody wants fucking hash  so were gonna sell this whole driveway  probably in two days its awesome  music   ricky i need my cart hammer back   do you want trinity drivin g around the park with no brakes  im just changing the brake hose for trinity  i dont want her driving aroun d the park in an unsafe car  when we sell the hash im gonna give her this car  how many fathers can give their 9yearold daughter a car  im just happy im in a position i can do something like that   ricky do you really think its a good idea  to be letting trinity drive around in your car  come on man i need your help over here buddy   julian let me tell you a little story  about something my dad taught me okay   ricky no offence but your dad taught ya  your dads kind of a drunk  chronic vlt gambler  put in jail for defrauding the government you know  s  well hes also one of the best fucking father  a person couldve had well be bailing him out of jail  later on today when we sell the hash   anyway i know you guys think youre smarter than me  and who fucking knows maybe you are  but one thing i know is when youre growing up   you gotta fucking do illegal shit once in a while  have a bit of fun and maturinate into a better person  if you go to jail you learn a fucking lesson  and you dont go to jail after that  you know your thoughts might be better than mine  o but i have thoughts going around in my head to  e about different thinkings an d brain things that you can us   and doing different things  and i think i know whats best for my daughter  so fuck off and let me fix the brakes for my daughter  and then ill help you with the hash  you guys dont always know whats best  so my thoughts have feelings of their own too
