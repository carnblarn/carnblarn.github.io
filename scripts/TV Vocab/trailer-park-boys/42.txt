alright  you cant call it garbageland if youre going on tv with me  well rickys used stuff does that work  i guess so lets just do it  my business isnt exactly the kind of business  you want to promote  on tv because you know ive got quite a bit of stolen  renovation supplies around the park  and yes it is kind of greasy but you know im fixing  up the trailers and im going to sell  them eventually so its a good business move  so i think today the best thing for me to do is to lay low  maybe work on my deck or do some interior work or something  im working really hard these days with julian  uh were getting to hang out quite a bit  he needs someone to help him with renovations and building installation  and stuff like that so im dealing with a lot of the transport  and the delivery of really important materials to get stuff done  this is officer jim lahey exofficer jim lahey  doing surveillance on julian who appears to be renovating  his trailer with stolen building  materials and tools  for the purposes of this surveillance  i will appear to be intoxicated  but i am in fact sober this for the record is iced tea  begin surveillance  corey here  hey maybe i could keep those boxes for trevor  no get rid of the boxes  corey i told you to get rid of these signs  jim  hey listen randy asked me if  id fix bill and alvenas lattice work  some little shits kicked it
