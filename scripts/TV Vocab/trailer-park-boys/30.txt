want things to go downhill  we dont wanna lose our friends our families  and this is all weve got   we spent the money on a couple of things  but really like i think we were kind of owed you know  s we went through a lot of shi t over the last couple of year  and i got like 7500 bucks  and you got like what five grand or something   yeah something like that  but you know where most of the money went   corey and trevor gave me nine grand  to produce one track on the new album dawg  for real know what im saying  thats cheap  thats family rate dawg  yeah man  ricky and julian are suppose to be getting out of jail today  its gonna cause some problems in the park  but oh well what can you do   man come on corey and trevor gave us the money  we aint gonna ask them where it came from  were
