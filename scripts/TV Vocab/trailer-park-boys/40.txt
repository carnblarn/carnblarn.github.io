 a bit of a smell because of the recycles and theres fucking bees  and hornets and wasps and shit everywhere but she spent  friday night in my car we got drunk and stuff so what does that mean  lucy

cat meow  tell me what you think of the rat wheel  you like that  is that going to be a hit  after some tense negotiations with barb lahey i worked out  a deal where i could move my shed  on this lot and just pay half lot fees  i mean its still a lot of money for me but ive been managing it just barely  ive always wanted to open something called the kittyland love centre  a daycare centre for cats and ive always been too afraid because  mr lahey and randy would just ruin it on me with all the drinking  and the craziness but im starting to think this is time open up kittyland  its over im breaking up with mr lahey ive tried everything  with him but the drinking is out of control we tried the twelve steps  i even drank with him mixed his drinks tried smoking  some dope with him to quit the drinking but nothing seemed to work  hes lost complete control of this trailer park and thats where i draw the line  mr lahey mr lahey what the hell happened wheres the roof of our car  wake up mr lahey come on  groan  come on mr lahey  mumbling  morning rand  what happened to the car  barbs going to freak  geez rand i dont remember shit what are we going to do boy  youre going to watch this tape mr lahey  i hope you see what youre really like when youre drunk  its over mr lahey im leaving you for good  well im sorry to hear about you and jim  if theres one thing i can relate to its trying your damnedest  to make things work with that man it is not easy  barb  yes rand  the reason i stopped by is to tell you that ill do anything  to be the supervisor of this trailer park  randy you didnt leave jim just because you want to run the park  no barb its because i care ive been watching mr lahey really closely  for the last few years and i think  i can do this or i could put out  some resumes to some other parks how can i prove it to you  mr lahey wake up mr lahey  hi deputy rand how you doing  nice day for the race what are you doing rand  a little surveillance mr lahey  doing a little surveillance are you well would you like a little show rand  a little little show a little lahey show that would be nice wouldnt it  oh check this one out im going to do a wrap around  oh fuck look what you made me do randy  bottle smashing  you want a show  when was that  ill tell you what randy theres uh  one particular trailer park resident who has got to go  go  thats right go so if you can manage to make that happen  ie evict that person then im going to know that you are up to  the big challenge of running the park and i might see my way  to making some kind of arrangement how does that sound  that sounds great thank you barb  uh randy  look look randy im mowing the air rand im mowing the air  geez  youre the best assistant trailer  park supervisor anybody ever had  you get up in the morning and make me my coffee and you go to the commission rand now  fuck  randy turn the fucking thing off youre embarrassing yourself boy  im taping you mr lahey so when youre straight  you can watch your little show here you pissed yourself mr lahey  officer uh ted johnson gave me his um his card  and uh its his personal line if ever i should need him  now you know he call screens you and jim for obvious reasons  but if you tell him that i gave you this card and call that number  you might find that you get a little bit of help today  go slow randy and dont be afraid to ask for help  thanks barb listen ive got some frozen burgers  and i was wondering if i could put them in your freezer until i find a new place to live  ray can you not throw your dirty old piss jugs around please  hey dad got you some more piss jugs  oh excellent boy youre right on man  ray theres got to be a better system than this peeing in jugs  youre going to make barb lahey mad  barb doesnt care bubbs  its an empty lot  its not like theyre right out in the open dont worry about it  way of the road buddy  yeah i dont know if you noticed or not ray but youre not on the road  your rig cab doesnt move an inch  way of the road bubbs  ray used to be on the road as a trucker and thats what truckers do  theyre driving along and theyve got deadlines to meet  they dont want to pull in park their truck walk in take a pee in the toilet  and get back out and get on the road they just have an old jug  and they put their bird in it have  a pee cap it off and once its full  they just drill the fucking thing out on the highway  i mean i dont agree with it  i see where theyre coming from trying to make their deadlines  but rays been firing them all over the park like hes still driving a truck  here buddy get this into you im on my third  were getting fucking today  ricky youre supposed to pick julian up at jail  hes been calling all morning  well i didnt know im sure hes called astronaut cock  and snoopy the fuckdog by now theyll take care of it  whos astronaut cock and snoopy the fuckdog  the counselors in jail said that we were too dependent on ricky  for our happiness and that that was a bad thing  they also said that he was like a father to us or something  yeah then they told us that we had to think more for ourselves  so we did and now we have a store  and its ours like its all ours  its sarahs too but its mostly ours  well corey and trevor have been out of jail for a little while  and im really encouraging them to branch out on their own  one of the things that i think is important for them is that they have  something from within to give them selfrespect so theyre not  constantly looking for approval from ricky and julian  so theyve started their own convenience store  and i think thats gonna really do a lot for their selfesteem  its a pretty big accomplishmet for me to be running a store  cause growing up in the park i always looked up to the guys  that were running the store almost as much as i looked up to ricky  but you know that didnt turn out to be a good thing  the counselor said i was dependent on him and that i shouldnt do that  so i was like well ill take a negative and turn it into a positive  and become a store a store owner like all the guys i looked up to as a kid  morning gentlemen did you see randy about  no dude but i heard you broke up with the cheeseburger walrus  onion ring sasquatch  laughter  shouting  you better step off mr lahey  step off where trevor  shit ledge  excuse me what the hell is  stop acting hard in the store mr lahey  sarah  excuse me trevor trevor drop him  stay there  these guys were juxtaposing unusual animal names  and greasy fat food products calling randy names  is that true you were calling randy names  i called him a cheeseburger walrus  i called him an onion ring sasquatch cause he is  hey  you guys stop it right now  mr lahey look well give you whatever you want on the house okay  what can i get you  couple of packs of smokes  two of packs of smokes lets go  do you want some matches mrlahey  shove em trevor  alarm rings  jail has been awesome this time like im

to get into real estate  so im looking for a trailer and a lot  nothing fancy you know something i can fix up move into  for a little while sell and make some money  anything available  oh im sure we can come up with something but i would need  the money upfront im sure you appreciate that  oh of course  this should be enough for a trailer  and heres one years lot fees  so when can this happen  well as a matter of fact theres a trailer coming up this afternoon  theres some issues with the lot but im sure we can sort something out  thanks for coming down look mr lahey  is not the reason that i called  its i just need some help with look the whole park its going  to shit and i didnt really know what to do and im really  sorry for calling your personal line  randy you know its alright just relax ive already talked to barb  she told you about the eviction  yeah she did and she also told me to tell you that  you cant be trailer park supervisor and the assistant supervisor  just doesnt have the authority to do an eviction  but she did tell me you can be associate trailer park supervisor  thats a promotion  right on  and uh i heard you broke up with jim lahey and i gotta say  good for you i dont know how you put up with that guy for so long  it was really tough officer  hey why dont you call me ted  and randy you know i can relate i just went through a bad break up myself  somebody i work with down at the station for years  but im doing good now  you look good  thanks randy  now lets go do this eviction  singing his name is duke and he is a good cat  police sirens  cops cops theres randy with no pants on  julian theres your new trailer ray youre a squatter  you dont pay your lot fees you stole your hydro you been  playing loud music and you been throwing around these urine containers  all over the park as associate trailer park supervisor  i am here to inform you you are evicted from sunnyvale effective immediately  what the fuck are you talking about you cant evict him  you dont have fucking authority to evict him randy  frig off  what kind of a cop lets a man with no shirt and no pants into his police cruiser  i think its just a scare tactic cause who wants to grab  a hold of randy when hes just in his underwear then theres  just that one piece of fabric separating  you from his from his package  cause i mean when he has his pants on he can only get his legs  so far apart and hes doesnt have that much balance  but when hes in his underwear  you know he can get like a football player  and hes hard to knock over then big coagulated gravy hot dog bun bastard  youre not evicting me im leaving you hear me buddy  you think i want to stay here you know what makes the park great buddy  its the people you cant treat people this way pal i dont want to stay here  youre going to turn sunnyvale into shittyvale you and fucky the drunk clown you hear me  i dont agree with kicking ray out of the park i mean  i do see the point that the trailer park has here that ray doesnt  pay lot fees and he lives in a old rig sleeper there hes basically  a squatter and he does throw a lot of piss jugs around nobody enjoys those  you know something buddy oh fuck thats great  you know what im going to a much better place than this anyway  you know you wouldnt even understand it its close to hospitals  churches the lc its luxury beyond your wildest dreams pal  you know you think youve done okay for yourself dont ya  yeah go climbing the social ladder gone from drunk male  prostitute to associate trailer park supervisor  youll pay for this randy  way to go mr ambitious  randy  frig off randy  when my dad got kicked out of the park i was really pissed off   but i talked to him about it and hes actually pretty cool with the whole idea  i got a truck coming to get his rig sleeper and all of his stuff  and i guess he found this great place lots of nature and  animals running around and a lot of open space and he says  hes got free cable and everythings included with his rent  and his rents really cheap i guess i just cant wait to check it out  it sounds like hes got a really really nice place to live  that feels pretty level dad  think thats got it buddy listen thanks for the tow i really appreciate it  no problem you sure you wont come back to the park  no  not as long as those two dicks are there   lahey and randy running the place im never coming back rick  alright well i gotta take off  okay buddy   you okay  yup fine  listen ricky dont tell anyone  im living at the dump okay  you got it dad  closed captioning by
