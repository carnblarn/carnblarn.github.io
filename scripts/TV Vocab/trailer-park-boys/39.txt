long this time  gumby and puffuckeo are in jail with them  corey and trevor i mean  thats what ricky calls them  gumby and puffuckeo   in my line of work you gott a deal with the consequences  and you learn from your mistakes i have  i mean corey and trevor that was the whole problem  its all their fault   thing with me is that i am smart  and im selfsmarted basically by myself  basically from nature and smoking drugs  and doing different things  ive self  like selflearned myself  and thats the whole difference i guess  its that i dont need the books or the schoolingtype things  n i just get everything on my ow  and because of that im alive right now  i mean if id read more books or tried to go on to college  and different things like that  id be dead right now  because people say books and college  are for to be to make you smarter  but they can also be for to be to get you dead  which is what couldve happened to me  my brain doesnt use enough oxygen  cause i dont have the whole thing  filled with different stuff  and if it was full its only partfull  and thats why im alive right now  guards in here are here read this book  try to get smarter im like alright   ill pretend to read it im not gonna really read it  cause then my brain would be more full  and if i have another heart attack  im gonna die   im gonna go back to reading  figure out a plan  soon as i get out im gonna work on that plan  its gonna be tight  and im gonna fucking retire in about a years time   i just wanna get out of here now and spend time  with lucy and trinity and get my family going again  basically thats all that matters to me  they come and visit me a couple times in jail  for the first time ever which is awesome  lucy seems to be really digging me  and looking really good   and i just wanna get outta her e and see them exercise a bit  maybe eat better and try to quit smoking  well im gonna quit smoking cigarettes first  and then you know work off the dope or whatever eventually  although i dunno  music
