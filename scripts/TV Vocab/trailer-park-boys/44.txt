                knock  whats going on randy  hey bubbles  i was wondering if i could ask you for a favour  what kind of a favour  well its just im confused about things  mixed up  im attracted to a bunch of different things  what kind of things randy  well you know how mr lahey and i we were  yup  well bubbles youre not going to  tell anybody about this right  right  tell anybody about what

of going to a couple of websites randy  i mean do you like this type of thing  i like those things bubbles  yeah i know  me too  or i mean  theres also this type of things  i like that thing too  alright randy  i mean i think that clears that up  you know youre just kind of attracted  to whatever but lots of people are  thats normal  thanks bubbles  alright  music  hey ted  randy  weve got a problem  problem  yeah the chiefs on my case about spending too much time  in the park and why ive got a  three hundred and sixty five dollar  expense claim for cheeseburgers so i lied to him told him  i was doing surveillance  i need you to do me a favour  i need you to do surveillance on ricky and julian  it doesnt  look good when a peace officer hangs out at a place like  this where there is clearly crime  being committed and driving  around with a former male prostitute and  blowing hundreds of bucks on cheeseburgers  you checked my record ted  yes i did randy  thats my job  i thought you liked me  well i do randy  you know  i mean youre a great guy  but hey dont eat the bun just the meat  its part of the burger ted  randy  it seemed to me like maybe randy and officer ted were  in a bit of a lovers quarrel and then  they came over to the store as usual  hoping to get a little dirt on corey and trevor  hi sarah  can i have an apple juice please  sorry we dont have juice  gee i dont know much about business but if i was going  to open up a convenience store i think the first thing id do  is stock up on merchandise otherwise its not very convenient for the customer  seems obvious right randy  i dont know  well i dont know a whole lot about being a cop but it seems  to me like a constable on patrol should be out patrolling  and not in here harassing me seems pretty obvious  randy my eyes are up here  come on randy lets go  ah actually ted  im not going to go   ive got work to do here  here you go bud  bye ted  i dont think that officer ted and randy are going  to stay together  officer ted is obviously using randy to  his own ends and hes also trying to change him  he brought him an ab flexor the other day  if you dont love him the way he is just leave him alone  i think its fucking great the way hes back in the fucking liquor drunk as fuck  its great you know basically he just roams around this park  doing little chores for his bitchy  little boss

i like talking cheeseburgers  with you and shit but im dont have  those kind of feelings for you  at all  okay  are we still cool  yeah  shit  trevor its not your fucking toke   for fucks sakes  good afternoon gentlemen  sorry to interrupt  i think i might have had a little bit too much to drink  then maybe again  boys get him out of here before he pisses himself again please  dude you gotta let us draw cocks on him  okay knock yourselves out  nice  that wont be necessary boys you see im not the least bit drunk  i havent been drunk for 26 glorious  days of undercover police work  making a little video tape starring julian and ricky  what the fuck are you talking about  youre wasted  alright  you talking about this rick  how you doing buddy  how you doing ricky its a great party you got here bud  hey jules you love a good party dont you baby  sexy  its iced tea  hes not drunk  no kidding  halloween 1977 jules   you remember dont you bubbles  whats at work here is some shit tectonics when two shit plates strike  and come together under incredible  pressure  what happens bubbles  what mr lahey  shit quake  may the force be with you gentlemen  and may i be with the force  oh my fuck  i remember halloween 1977 like it was yesterday  i remember everything about that night  well i didnt even smoke dope back in 77  so i can tell you exactly what happened on halloween  i remember halloween 1977 perfectly  we dressed up as people from star wars   and i remember julian copied off me  i dont even remember what i dressed up as   luke skywalker or dark vader  or something but julian copied off me   bubbles was the gold guy  i remember that  had my c3p0 outfit on  i remember the way the moon was  gleaming off the gold  i just wanted to get candy  and julian was on the liquor  i mean we were only kids  but he was still driving liquor into him  then we see lahey coming home he just got off duty  parked his car got out  ricky decides he wants to fuck over his cop car  bubbles or julian i cant remember which one it was probably julian  but i think it was bubbles said lets got mess around with his cop car over here  julian had the idea he wanted to get into some mischief  i remember is what he called it and he wanted to go push laheys car  put it out of gear and see where it would roll to  they put the car out of gear and started pushing it  and it picked up way more speed than they thought it would  and it crashed right into a fucking trailer  i remember thinking  oh my god now we did it  and lahey he was a cop back then it was his car he ran out  all he wanted was to take julians liquor cause julian was  drinking big time back then julian fought him for it liquor went up  got spilled all over lahey and his uniform  he finally got the liquor  got back to his car and was trying to get car unstuck from  the trailer in reverse and liquor spilled all over his crotch  next thing you know george green shows up he was laheys partner  hes the stupidest cop there is he thought lahey was drunk pissed himself  it did look like he was drunk and pissed himself  he wasnt drunk  i dont think he even pissed himself at all   so it was a misunderstanding  he started saying now listen george this isnt what it looks like  and george told him he was drunk and as they started arguing  all that did is make lahey look more drunk  and crazier than he actually was back then  and next thing laheys under arrest and it was our fault  it came down to two choices and lahey well he resigned  i just cant believe that julian and bubbles they they ruined mr laheys life  he lost his career he lost his marriage  went down the tubes and he lost his mind  mr lahey used to be nice back then  and we turned him into a drunk crazy lunatic  ted unless im reinstated theres going to be law suits for  wrongful dismissal defamation of character and twenty years  of retroactive salary  thats a lot of money  theres the evidence right there   all im looking for is a little justice  but you dont know anything about justice do you  none of you do  all you know about is looking sexy in your goddamned uniforms  jim calm down  you might be real goodlooking you might work out ted  but im ten times the cop that youll ever be  jim ill guarantee you fair treatment under one condition  whats that  just shut up a minute and knock off the sexy stuff  hows randy  hes good jim  so  well let me say jim impressive   you built a pretty strong case  but given your history with guns  dynamite and public drunkenness  theres serious reluctance to reinstate you  whats bottom line ted  no promises but i think theres enough evidence here  to get you a hearing before the police board   excellent  looking good right  yeah and i think you need to get some character witnesses  to prove that those boys drove you to do what you did  now jim do you know anybody who will say anything good about you  bobandy  closed captioning by powerpost
