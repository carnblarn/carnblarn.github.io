randy you fucking asshole  ricky  opening music   guys guys whats up with the bats   it appears that both these gentlemen claim ownership of that barbeque   look i admit the barbeque looks a lot like randys but its not his  i got it at a yard sale and the serial numbers accidentally  got scraped off and it got repainted its not his   i could prove that its mine even without a serial number  and even though its been painted 100   how are you going to do that randy  ill show you ricky lets go   randy forget it hes probably ruined it anyway lets go   but mr lahey you know how much that barbeque means to me it was a gift   its probably corey and trevor that stole your barbeque   its my barbeque dont break it   dont break that randy   ricky what do you think youre doing  how many times do i have to say it  no stealing inside of the park   theres a lot of money in barbeques theyre easy to steal  and the best part is house insurance covers it so nobody really gives a shit  the cops cant be bothered  and at the flea market you know you get fifty bucks a pop  for them which is awesome and if you steal and sell  four at a time its theft under a thousand and community service  worst case bubbles is even helping out   this here is where we repaint them strip em down  swap all the parts out cant tell where they came from then  its just like working on shopping carts really  and im damn good at that check this baby out  that there is called a super double bunkbeque  i built that myself id like to see the red blue green cocksucker  put one of those together ducttaping it   shit  i just wish i could steal more than four barbeques at a time  you know it pisses me off get this over with pay for the cruise in no time  but oh no julians afraid of getting caught and going to jail ridiculous  okay kids the first thing we have to do  is decide what kind of small business we want to start up  when i was younger we used to collect pop bottles and cans  we mowed lawns we fixed up old shopping carts and sold them  so what do we want to do for a small business for you guys  we gotta think about that   what do you do   i uh i remarket barbeques   daddy steals barbeques and sells them at the flea market   could we steal some  sure you could  but its not that simple cause you could go to jail   no we cant go to jail weve learned in school about the youth justice act  kids under twelve cant go to grown up jail   so we could steal as many barbeques as you want and no jail   yes you could   youre doing an awesome job bubbles   i know julian and i love doing this kind of stuff   good afternoon gentlemen   oh every time i start having fun   looks like industrial arts class here julian   no actually jim im fixing some barbeques for some friends  could you please get off my
