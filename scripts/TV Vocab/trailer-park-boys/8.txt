who sewed you up  its such a butcher of a job and i told them it was sam  i didnt know vets werent allowed to work on humans  and he would lose his practice   eight years eight years i worked at that practice  i had it built up nicely  now its gone paying fines and shit   sam lost everything and hes really pissed off  at ricky and julian   so now he feels like the next logical jump  is to run a
