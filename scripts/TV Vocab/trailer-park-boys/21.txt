                 whats wrong sweetie   youre always in jail at christmas   im gonna do my best to stay out of jail this year  were gonna go on the cruise instead of going to jail  ill tell you what i got a great idea  why dont we have christmas today   really   to make up for all the christmas i was in jail  well have real presents and everything   cool   come on out   youre not allowed doing that thats littering   ive noticed that if you throw something into a water body like  a lake or an ocean that the next day you come back and its gone  so somehow it takes it away and filters  it through and just cleans it up  like a garbage compactor or whatever  so its not really littering if you ask me  thats fine the waters gonna wash it all away sweetie  ah shit  were gonna have to borrow a tire from somebody trin  see you have to count the number of bolts  one two three four five  and daddys car has one two three four five  so this tire will fit on daddys car  here try putting your foot up on there like this  there you go see you can do it   i did it   ricky  listen how come youre not excited  about going on this cruise   i am excited bubbles  you know i think its pretty awesome  julian planning this whole thing and it worked out  hes a good fucking thinker  i just dont want to leave trinity man  im going to miss her and i want this to be  the best christmas ever ive got a lot of making up to do  cause im always in fucking jail at christmas   come on boys lets pick up the cruise tickets come on   bubbles get in the back   wait theres uh one more right  bonus ticket special  buy seven get one free  theres only seven tickets here there should be eight   ricky was supposed to phone me back to confirm the free ticket  i left him three messages and he never returned my calls   if you want to get a hold of ricky  youve got to go down to the car  or walk around the park looking for him yelling for him  you cant just phone him up   theres only seven of us going anyway its no big deal   wheres my ticket ricky   julian bubbles  corey trevor lucy sarah erica erica  what the fuck julian wheres my ticket   julian never told anybody that he was going to use  one of those for his new girlfriend   relax alright we can still get the bonus ticket now right   im sorry gentlemen that promotion ended last week  its too late now the ship sails at six   now ricky doesnt have a fucking ticket  sometimes you can just hear the things  fucking shorting out in his brain  i dont know what hes going to do  and were going to try to make corey and trevor  come up with fortytwo hundred dollars in about four hours   its kind of unfortunate that weve been paying  in to the vacation pay  with julian but something there was some kind of a mistake  or an accounting error and our our money got lost   corey and trevor are as stupid as fuck  if this is going to happen  im in charge of how we get the money  cause im not stupid  oh oh julian   the fastest way to get money is to steal a bank machine  you just take a fucking chain hook it up to a truck  and yank the fucking bank machine out of the store   the stupidest thing is the people that make the bank machines  they dont even check with the people that make the doors  all they have to do is make the door smaller than the bank machine  you cant get the bank machine out   dude i dont care how we do it but were going on a cruise man  its all about the ladies dude the ladies   were going to have to come back and get this  cause i still gotta do my laundry   yeah man lets rob the laundrymat  shit they got quarters and loonies  thats a dope idea   do you have any tube socks  fuck man thats what i was looking for   so ricky  uhhuh   corey and trevor stealing a bank machine  do you think thats a good idea   i would have did it myself bubbles ut im not going back to jail  besides julians the one that screwed everything up   ricky i just want you and erica to get along with each other okay  so could you please give her another chance   youve got chicken on your lip   ricky this doesnt look good  ohoh   he was having christmas dinner with his family with his daughter  there was a lot of unnecessary enforcement and reinforcement  and lahey comes in   ricky  what the fucks going on here   ive been waiting a long time for this boy   for what  you know the lease  you signed for your lot rick  yeah   it said if you made more than five sunnyvale bylaw infractions  you were out on your ass  but i didnt so fuck you   oh yeah  outstanding lot fees with written warnings  public drunkenness traffickinglittering excessive firearm discharge  environmental oil test results its all there officer   well when ricky first got out of jail mr lahey tricked him  into signing a legal thing saying
