julian is never gonna let his grandmothers trailer  be sold on the open market  we keep raising the price  julians gonna have to raise more money to buy it  and the only way julian can raise money  is

old man out of jail  thats fucked julian   rick rick rick were gonna sell it okay  we just need a perfect plan  whats wrong  with going door to door lots of people smoke dope  theyre gonna buy it  its careless okay  we start ripping this stuf f and going door to door  youre gonna get caught  and laheys gonna be the one to catch us   dont even fucking mention laheys name right now alright  its his fucking fault im in this situation  sonofabitch prick idiot drunk fuck  where do you wanna sell it   whered you sell the most dope ever in your whole life ricky  whered you make the most money   one of the best thing abou t school from my perspective  is everybody smokes dope so you can sell a lot of dope  i mean everybody smokes  students teachers  guidance counsellors people that work in the library  the guys that polish floors janitors the cafeteria workers  so im gonna go back to school  sell some dope and uh  do a bit of book learning at the same time cant fucking wait  dartmouth regional vocational school  julian are you fucked in the head  i thought we were going to fucking high school  i cant go to fucking vocational school   rick youre not selling has h in high school alright  youre old enough to be a teacher in high school rick  s think  yeah but the learning thing  that you get at fucking spoken out  and trying to get up in ther e and then you gotta fuck   rick rick rick  i cant do this man  my brain doesnt work this way  its not college level   this is the perfect place to sell hash  we are not gonna get caught everythingll be fine  come on  youll do alright ricky   think about your daughter think about lucy  theyre gonna be impressed with you  theyre gonna be so fucking proud of you man  come on lets go   julian this brain barely go t through fucking grade 7  well julians been all paranoid lately with fucking lahey  and all these books hes reading for fucksakes  e he says its too risky for m e to have a bunch of hash on m  around schools that do these random searches  f so he used this bigsmartthinking stuf  n to come up with this new pla  where i just take orders for hash in the daytime  get peoples locker number and combinations then at night  we break in to the school if theres money in the lockers  we just drop the hash off there use the honourly system  and hopefully its gonna work out good  theyre not gonna let me in here if they do  theres not a fucking chance im gonna get a greeting card  think about it im stupid   rick listen to me  dont let school shit distract you  youre here for one reason and thats to sell drugs  stay focused man   theres two ways to look at it really  either you go to school to learn  or you go to school to sell drugs  and rickys here to sell drugs  i mean maybe if it was unde r different circumstances  he could learn something  but julian wants him just to sell drugs  its kind of ironic really   think about selling drugs fuck school alright  good luck man   ricky you cant smoke in here   what  you cant smoke  julian you think theyre gonna let him in here   i fuckin hope so man   look i just wanna basically come to your school  and do some book learning okay  ive only got my grade 10  which i dont think is a big deal   some people might my dad just got thrown in jail  so i need to get some shit going here with a job and stuff  so basically you know  a lot of people might say im stupid i dunno  i dont think i am im probably smarter than that  i mean this thing here is smarter than me i guess  but it has a battery but if i can get  enough good brain thinking going at your school   maybe i can get a job which i need get my dad out of jail  buy shit for my daughter thats what im thinking here   well sorry schools already started  so theres nothing i can do there   ah fuck are you serious   but we are interviewing custodians  if youre looking for work   what interviewing what   janitors  janitors im not  im not qualified to do that  werent you listening  ive only got my grade 10   well you dont need a grade 10  but you have to go through the interview process   really well  how about we skip the interview process  and i give you a little bi t of this stuff  to basically say that ive got the job  and give me one of those jackets right over there  i want ricky on the sleeve and grade 10 on the other sleeve   well basically i couldnt get into school
