                previously on battlestar galactica  some people in the fleet believe that the legend of earth  held perhaps the greatest promise for our survival   do you know how to find it  not really no  there was a hope my hope that if you knew the way to earth  it would justify keeping you alive a little longer  now when i say  that i do not know exactly where earth is that is not to say  that i do not know a very great deal about its probable location  the baseship we sent to investigate the pulsars in the lion nebula  weve lost contact  the missing baseship its been infected by a disease  if an infected cylon dies  and carries this disease into a resurrection ship  it could rapidly spread potentially infecting our entire race  if one of us is resurrected  the disease will follow  then no cylon can board that ship without risking infection  ill go yes ill go  i can go to the baseship  i can make observations about the cylons their physical condition  bring back information about this disease which now threatens all of you  do you know what this is  it must be some kind of beacon  must have been left here by the 13th tribe  the beacon carried the disease  left by some humans like you to destroy us  you noticed nothing suspicious on the infected ship  nothing whatsoever  i am just as baffled as you are  just like the scriptures say there it is  the lions head nebula and the blinking eye  holy crap its the road to earth  this is combat  prep and ready plan a  we are approaching the baseship  this is just so wrong  what the hell happened here  whatever this is its something new  go  apollo galactica you are cleared hot  roger that galactica  were in pretty close now  and by the look of it that ships in no condition to put up a fight  ive never seen anything like this   shall we proceed  hang on guys  use extreme caution apollo  set perimeter up and steady everyone  galactica apollo were in  galactica apollo no sign of life  ship appears to be abandoned and powering down  what the hell  gods what happened here  i dont know but their frakking resurrection ship is gonna overheat  galactica apollo  weve reached the control center  maybe 40 dead skinjobs  mathias set up perimeter  sharon athena  see what you can pick up with the computers  three fireteams each doorway  go  im gonna try to call the database  if i get a connection put the ssr leads in the water over there  reduce the error correction level for higher throughput   are you sure you want to do that  its how it works  you okay  yeah the datapoints are almost completely corroded  i dont know if im gonna get much out of here but lets try  what is going on  frak me this ones alive  weve got a live on over there  danelli peters cover the major  theyre alive  galactica apollo weve got   i say again five living   are you taking fire  negative negative  they seem in pretty bad shape  dont take any chances they make any threatening moves  you can trust me on that one  major what do we do should we take em out  hold your fire hold your fire   heavenly father  keep away from the frackers  i said hold your fire  grant us  the strength the wisdom   what are they doing  and above all  a measure  hey athena what are you doing  athena what are you doing  traitor  save yourself  from what  get away from us  what happened here  the beacon  we brought it onboard  it carried a disease  were infected  infected   son of a bitch  okay okay okay  settle down keep back  watch the doorways get the doorways  galactica apollo  we have a situation down here  the cylons have been infected with  a disease  we have all been exposed  weve all been exposed   theyll have to come aboard under quarantine procedures  clear a path from the hangar deck to sickbay and sterilize it   and the raptors after theyre in  ill handle that  how long will they have to stay in quarantine  i wont know that until i do the blood work could be days weeks  theres no way to tell  you said they picked up this disease from a beacon  according to the cylons  always good to have the source of the pathogen  can you bring it aboard galactica  no too dangerous i want to limit our exposure   what about the prisoners  prisoners  the disease is more advanced in their systems  so itll give at least an idea of what to expect as it progresses  and when they die itll tell me how long our people have to live   how many prisoners  how many you got  apollo galactica alpha check  galactica we have you in visual range approaching starboard hangar  apollo what was that  massive energy discharge from the baseship  it exploded sir  apollo galactica are you all right out there  uh yeah affirmative were still here  what the hell happened  baseship exploded must have selfdestructed  you guys are lucky you got out when you did  roger that  nothing the matter i trust  we have some questions  how long have you planned to betray us gaius  funny  youre joking of course  youre only making this harder on yourself  wait a minute  i have been more  than very accommodating since i arrived here  i helped you find sharons baby  ive helped you with a map towards earth  we know about the beacon gaius  you knew it was out there you knew it contained a deadly virus  no i didnt i didnt  was the virus created by galactica  have you been in contact with them since youve been onboard  or did you plan this before the evacuation of new caprica  this is a most profound misunderstanding  i had nothing to do with the virus or the beacon  yes  yes i did discover it on the baseship  and i should have told you about it sooner  and i didnt  because i thought you know  youd try to link me you know to the virus  which is hello you know whats going on right now  i was wrong and it was a mistake and i fully admit my responsibility  it will never happen again and i hope youll accept my most  yeah my most humble apology  on a brighter note  i have a working theory as to where this beacon may  im sorry gaius  things would have been so much simpler had you only told the truth  we think you know more about this virus and we intend to find out  relax have a drink  i cant  the pain  the pain  its all in your head gaius  pain pleasure theyre just neural impulses sent to the brain  you decide how to interpret them  they can be pleasant  or unpleasant  no please  please  i wanted to stop gaius  i dont want you to feel this pain  and neither does caprica do you  no  i love you  you feel anything yet  yeah i feel sick sick of you buggin me  you didnt touch any infected skinjobs  not my fault youre clumsy  you can kiss my infected ass  well you can kiss it but its not infected  i got your blood work back humans are immune to the virus youre all healthy  all right people nice job lets get outta here  no  you stay put for a while  no no no no no no  please tell me shes okay  i havent done her bloodwork yet  what  oh i see she can wait because of who she isnt  sharon  youre gonna be okay promise  you come for me gods damn it you come for me the second you know  take him hes the furthest gone  you can keep the cylons alive  i cant cure them but yes  how long  indefinitely  i identified the virus  we know it as lymphocytic encephalitis  the disease is carried by rodents rats mostly  but a couple of hundred years ago humans developed an immunity  now i can create a simple vaccine  that will dramatically reverse the effect of the virus on the cylons  but they have an antibody in their blood which  breaks down the rna of the vaccine  so they will need regular closeinterval  injections of the vaccine or they will die  can i ask the ugly question here is there a reason to keep them alive  we could interrogate them for intelligence  i agree  we have a lot of unanswered questions  yeah okay but theyre not gonna talk  well they might if we dangled the vaccine  they dont need to know its a stopgap  not a cure  they prayed on the infected ship  karls wife said it was something called  the prayer to the cloud of unknowing whatever the hell that is  anyway point is she said  they only use it when theyre facing an imminent death that is final  no possibility of downloading  theyre ready to die  they may be ready to die  but it doesnt mean that one of them wont jump at a second chance  it infected everything  baseship  centurions  raiders  until we were finally abandoned  by the other cylon ships  why  why not just put you under quarantine until they found a cure  fear   of spreading the disease  they told us   that there was a bioelectric feedback component  to the pathogen  it corrupts how our brains manage our immune systems  if one of us dies  and is resurrected  the disease will follow  infecting the resurrection ship  and the fleet  why were you in this area in the first place  we were sent  we were sent here   to look for the lion nebula  baltar   said it would point the way to earth  what did you just say  baltars alive  baltar  is on our baseship  hes helping us   find earth  hes using our navigation charts  along with our map from kobol  hes leading them to earth  we   want   a new beginning  much like you  i gave you information  she said that there   there was a cure  doc cottle will be  giving you the medicine   take him back to the infirmary  yes sir  the hells so funny  i think i just  thought of a way to solve all of our problems  to get rid of the cylon threat for once and for all  we can wipe em out  we can destroy the entire cylon race  we jump to an area we know the cylons use as a supply line  ncd2539 we stay there  exposed we look as if were spoiling for a fight  theyll send their fleet  and where theres a fleet theres a resurrection ship  and once the resurrection ship is within our reach  we execute our infected prisoners  we bug out  the executed prisoners download into the resurrection ship  and with them the virus  youre sure the virus will download to a new body  the cylons are sure of it  they left  their wounded out here to die alone with no hope of being rescued  tells me all i need to know  and once the virus is in the resurrection ship  therell be no stopping it  rescuers become carriers of the plague  cylons themselves dont believe  that theyll develop a cure  oh my gods  this could be the end of the cylons entirely  forever  genocide  so thats what were about now  theyre not human  they were built  not born  no fathers no mothers no sons no daughters  i had a daughter i held her in my arms  and she was half human  these are things dangerous things   this is our chance to be rid of them  you can rationalize any way you want  we do this   we wipe out their race   then were no different than they are  captain i respectfully disagree  the cylons struck first in this war and  not being content with the annihilation  of billions of human beings  they pursued us relentlessly through the galaxies  determined to wipe us out  they tried to live with us on new caprica  what did you say  they tried to live with us on new caprica  you were not on new caprica  to my recollection you didnt set foot there  so out of respect for the hundreds of men and women on your  crew who suffered through that snake pit  im gonna pretend i didnt hear that  you would serve your fleet well if youd remember occasionally  the cylons are a mortal threat to the survival of the human race  im talking about right and wrong  im talking about losing a piece of our souls  no one wants to hear that right  lets keep it on me  im married to a cylon   who walked through hell for all of us how many times  and shes not half anything  okay how do we know there arent others like her  she made a choice  shes a person theyre a race of people  wiping them out with a biological weapon is a crime against   is a crime against humanity  but theyre not human theyre programmed  we will take your input under advisement  thank you both  thank you maam  dismissed  i can help you  i can guide you through the torment and beyond  but youll have to do the work  ill do anything  anything  then tell us what we want to know  how was the virus invented  did they make a cure  look at me  look at me  when you make love to me gaius  you dont always think about me  your mind wanders i know that  you think of equations puzzles  your laundry  its the nature of the mind to disconnect  from the body enjoining on its own  separate your mind from your body  keep your mind in that room  use your intellect against her  reason  logic  analysis  find the holes in her psyche  i cant pain  the pains only in your body  so keep your body here with me  dont worry  ill take care of it  you see gaius this is what the absence of pain feels like  its easy to forget  i had nothing to do with the virus  it was a coincidence  theres no such thing as coincidence  god wills the universe according to his design  now  focus on her  as a cylon not a woman  be a scientist  examine her faith  whats your analysis doctor  im a scientist  and as a scientist  i believe that if god exists our knowledge of him is imperfect why  because the stories and myths we have are the products of men  the passage of time  the religion in practice is based on a theory  impossible to prove  yet you bestow it with absolutes like  there is no such thing as coincidence  its called faith  absolute belief in gods will means theres a reason for everything  everything  and yet  you cant help ask yourself how god can allow death and destruction  and then despise yourself for asking  but the truth is if we knew gods will wed all be gods wouldnt we  i can see it in your eyes danna  youre frustrated  youre conflicted let me help you  let me help you change  find a way to to reconcile your your faith with fact  find a way towards a rational universe  i dont know what your game is but its not going to work  you intentionally led one of our ships to that beacon didnt you  give your body to me  only your mind is there  feel me feel this where she wants you to feel pain  look at me  look at me gaius  do you want me to believe youre worth saving  do you do you  say it  i want you to believe in me  dont stop  dont stop  please please dont stop  you have to believe in me youre all i have left  now tell me you believe in me  tell me you believe in my strength  i believe in you  i believe in you  i love you  i love you with all my heart  i love you with all my heart  how  cottle said it had something to do with carrying a halfhuman child  how the fetal blood cells enter the maternal circulatory system  causing the mother to create antibodies whatever  im immune  our baby  saved my life  shes gone forever and she saved my life  hera kept us together  share this  this  you mean us  together   you mean us  them them  i mean them  whos them  theyre gonna execute the infected prisoners  but not until we jump into a cylon region  with a resurrection ship present  the infections gonna spread everywhere  theres a point id like to make  the law forbids me to use  biological weapons without a direct presidential order  which means youre passing the buck  on this one yes  helos right on one thing  we start destroying entire races even mechanical races  were liable to tear off a piece of mans soul  the cylons are coming to earth  if they find us they are coming for us  those are the stakes  they always have been bill  were talking about the genocide of your entire race  yeah  you think i dont know that  i made a choice  to wear a uniform  to be a person  you were a person before you put on that uniform  okay you were a person before i fell in love with you   you dont have to prove that  i have to prove it every day  let me tell you something helo  my people may die  my entire race may be wiped out  but this cylon  will keep her word  even if it means shes the last cylon left in the universe  can a human being do that  posterity really doesnt look too kindly on genocide  youre making an assumption that posterity will define this as genocide  if they do at least therell be someone alive to hate us for it  the cylons are our mistake we created them  all right admiral adama  as president i have determined the cylons be made extinct  the use of biological weapons is authorized  so say we all  so say we all  jump complete  dradis is clear no cylons sir  theyll be here soon enough get our birds in the air  commence viper and nav raptor launch  lets do this racetrack  lets go take up this bird  move that get it out of the way go  come on  cap is away nav bird has them on dradis  dradis contact  a pair of cylon raiders   keeping their distance for now  didnt take em that long  theyre just scouts  theyll jump away and report back to their fleet  see if they take our bait  got em  theres a resurrection ship with them  then its time to execute our cylon prisoners  call it in  terminate the prisoners  head shots okay   yes sir  lets do it  all right lets see if we can frak up some toasters on this joy ride people  bogies holding hands im notching like hell up here  hotdog starbuck  quit your bitchin and continue to cover as fragged  get out of the way  frak  theyre already dead  sir you should hear this  they were dead before the resurrection ship was in range  they didnt download the disease we have missed our window  galactica starbuck a baseship just jumped in  call our birds in spool up  lets get the hell outta here   commence ftl  yes sir  we lost time waiting to hear from quarantine  were gonna take significant fire while we spool up  any minute  continue jump  take us back to our fleet  yes sir  theyll be coming for me  you or me  seems like theyre always coming for one of us  im not a traitor  i love my people i love this ship  besides you the first thing i wanna see on any morning  are the lights in that cic  i did what i thought was right  if it was a mistake fine i can live with that  its you i cant live without  ill always love you helo  no thanks  the prisoners died of asphyxiation  the air purification system was reversed  sucked the oxygen out  when this happens the deadbolts are  automatically activated on the door   someone did this manually  someone  seems to me theres only one or two likely suspects   who will head the investigation  no one   im closing the book on this  how convenient  cottles report on the virus  he thinks  that it was simply an accidental contamination  of the beacon we abandoned on the sick baseship  somebody sneezed maybe  yeah an entire race almost wiped out  because someone forgot to wipe their nose  according to cottle  the virus  was an exact match  to one reported over 3000 years ago  right around the time that the 13th colony left kobol  that beacon  was a signpost to earth  i think were on the right trail laura  yes we are on the right trail bill  so are the cylons
