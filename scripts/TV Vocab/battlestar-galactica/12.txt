standard  no 6 do you love her  did you  roslin dr baltar  if something should happen to me it is vital that you comprehend  and are familiar with the political structures beginning to fall into place here   do you understand this  answer me  yes of course i understand  my answer is no  no i dont think i can handle this right now  baltar the intricacies of the bureaucracy i cant get my head around  this which with all due respect madam president  you have spent your entire political career learning to understand  more to the point  how you could think that my head could be turned so quickly  by a new thing  it just astounds me  how did you seriously think i could cope with this kind of responsibility  no 6 i dont believe you  youre a genius are you not  baltar well quite frankly i dont give a flying frack  whether you believe me or not all right because ive had it  i am tired of being pushed and prodded around like im some kind of toy   im not your plaything  plaything  i dont work for you  and quite frankly i dont have to sit here anymore  and take this kind of abuse from either of you  you either  either in here either in there wherever it is i dont need to take it   i love you gaius  do me a favour  no 6 yeah  i think perhaps you need a break from this  youre right  we need a break  id like to be alone if you dont mind    no 6 how can you love her gaius baltar i dont  you cant lie to me i know everything you know  thats lovely  thank you  did you  did you want something in particular this time  i thought you should know  that its not safe to remain on galactica  what are you talking about  its a surprise  tell me what is it what is it  is it a bomb another cylon bomb right  is it an agent  is a cylon agent about to be activated  tell me  boomer galactica this is raptor 1 preparing to jump to sector 728  lets hope we find some supplies out there  tigh roger that good hunting out there  crash counter our spinner  fuel drives spun up and ready  jump in five four three two one  crashdown whoa baby    frack me    gaeta the fracking idiot  you cant plan a jump that close to a planet what if we jumped into it  it was great its fine we made it were cool  crashdown are you seeing this boomer yeah    crashdown oceans  continents  no let me at this thing  okay atmosphere reads as  nitrogen oxygen looks like enough co2 for green leafy things  im getting excited here boomer  boomer this could be it  this could be the big one this is the little planet that solves all our problems  boomer  do you think this is earth  no its not earth  its more important than that    doesnt really work as well as before huh  you know i do get cold  theres some things you should know helo  dont call me that  youre not even sharon  youre not even human so dont act like you know me  because you dont  but i am sharon and thats part of what you need to understand  sharon was a friend of mine  whatever twisted thing you are you are not sharon you got that  the only thing i want from you is a way off this fracked up world thats it  apollo going hunting  im adding a gunnery run to the jump test tomorrow  see if our boy can shoot anything with our ammo  so its a boy now  starbuck i changed my mind  apollo you ever wonder why everyone calls it a she but to you its a he  its fascinating lee you should write a paper  its not really my scene  im not as smart as say dr baltar  apollo how is the vice president by the way  i dont know havent seen him  so hes a love them and leave them kind of guy i guess  i guess  apollo ships just pass in the night starbuck yup  apollo didnt mean a thing  starbuck nope  just bored looking for something to do  so fracking the vice president seemed like a great way to waste some time   you want something from me  not a thing   i dont owe you anything  you dont owe me anything  because im just a cag and youre just a pilot   right  a pilot that cant keep her pants on  right  its just like old times kara  like when you got drunk and couldnt keep your hands off the major from wherever  starbuck god  why did you do it kara just tell me why  because im a screwup lee try and keep that in mind  billy commander adama is sending out another raptor  to conduct an aerial survey of this planet  billy it appears to have suffered some sort of calamity  but it could actually be inhabitable  billy aerial survey shows evidence of at least one city on the surface  billy it was obviously abandoned long ago  elosha how old are the ruins  we wont know for sure until we send a ground team  but the initial estimates have it  on the order of approximately 2000 years  thats around the time the 13 tribes first left kobol  roslin let me see  ruins what ruins  this is an inhabited city  look at the buildings  buildings  roslin look  elosha what did you see tell me laura    a domelike structure with six roads leading out of it like spokes  with something around it like columns like a forum like the forum on caprica actually  elosha the forum in the opera house in the city of the gods on kobol  this planet is kobol    billy kobol like kobol  elosha the birthplace of mankind  where the gods and man lived in paradise  until the exodus of the 13 tribes  madam president whats going on  its real the scriptures the myths the prophecies theyre all real  so say we all  baltar hello lieutenant  boomer hey doc  this is a bad time right  no im just cleaning my gun  boomer whats going on  i was going to ask you the same question  baltar actually i was looking for lt thrace  but sometimes its good to talk these things over  no 6 deep down she knows shes a cylon  but her conscious mind wont accept it  sometimes i have these dark thoughts   what kind of dark thoughts  her model is weak  always has been  but in the end shell carry out her mission  i dont know  but im afraid im going to hurt someone i feel like i have to be stopped  she cant be stopped shes a cylon  no 6 you cant help her gaius  but you could probably sleep with her thats what you want right  im not sure why  sometimes  we must embrace that which opens up for us  embrace  life can be a curse  as well as a blessing  you will believe me when i tell you  there are far worse things than death in this world  boomer so youre saying baltar no  what i say is meaningless  listen to your heart  embrace that which you know to be the right decision      you might be right this may be kobol  we should seriously consider permanent settlement on this planet  the scriptures tell us that kobol points the way to earth  organise a ground survey team three raptors  i want a complete survey of the ruins immediately  apollo yes sir  no 6 you should go  remember what i said gaius you dont want to be here when it happens  when what happens what would happen if i go  in fact i think im going to volunteer for the survey party  your presence wont be necessary doctor thank you  im the vice president of the colony selected in my own right  and i feel that my presence on the planet will be necessary commander  as your chief science advisor i have to analyse the samples  the team brings and it would be more efficient  if i can gather the samples by myself  unless you have any objection madam president  no objections thank you  we need to talk  sure  you okay  boomer what do you think  i think its hard to imagine that you forgot to check the chamber  i didnt forget  sharon whats going on  i know things havent been so great lately but  i wake up in the morning  and i wonder who i am  i wake up and wonder if im going to hurt someone  sharon you need help  not from you  you made that clear  boomer im on my own tyrol no youre not  thanks for coming out chief  youre dismissed  so according to the scriptures  if we had the arrow of apollo we could take it down to kobol and we could use it  to open the tomb of athena and find our way to earth  i didnt know you were that religious  neither did i  roslin something wrong with that adama no  its just new  there is no earth you understand that  it would seem that we were wrong  commander just because you and i dont know where it is  it doesnt mean it doesnt exist  madam president  i am not trying to mock your faith so please understand me  these stories about kobol gods  the arrow of apollo  theyre just stories legends myths  dont let it blind you to the reality that we face  reality is that the cylon raider has been successfully jumptested  reality is that cylon technology obviously outstrips our own  and reality is there is a good chance  the raider can jump all the way back to caprica and retrieve that arrow  and find our way to earth  roslin the real earth adama the raiders a military asset  i wont use it to go chasing some mythical arrow  im sorry  hot dog i say we find kobol count our blessings and just stay there  pilot but the sacred scrolls say that this could guide us to earth right  okay cut the chatter raptors 2 and 3 on me  ftls spun up and ready cally hold onto your lunch  crashdown jump in ten  nine eight  seven six five  four three  two one  eco jump complete gentlemen  bring the nose down we should see the planet directly ahead  what the hell is that  oh my god    cartman get us out of here  cartman we got a fire in the turbine shutting it down  baltar put it down  crashdown out of the way come on  crashdown get out of the seat doc  tyrol everybody hang on  tyrol can you jump us out  no the out drives been hit  tyrol socinus get on the horn  and tell raptor 2 to jump back to galactica  right now  jump back to galactica    jump back to galactica over  you are ordered to jump back to galactica    whenever theyre within proximity of one another  they send off a short iff burst  essentially they are cylon transponders  programmed to identify themselves to any other cylon transponder   damn nice work lieutenant  thats very good  now that we know what they are i want to test one in the raider  dualla draidus contact  raptor 275 sir  back early  somethings wrong  tyrol what the hell are you doing  baltar oh god tyrol hang on  baltar god oh my god  tyrol do it  crashdown everybody hit the deck    tyrol i cant see  tyrol pull it up  watch the hill  crashdown thanks for watching  how many people did we lose  apollo ten souls aboard raptor 3  raptor 1 last visual contact was seen  under power flight heading toward the surface  we need a way to take out the base ship before we can attempt a rescue  tigh starbucks working on a plan  using the captured raider to get a nuke into the base ship   the raider  when did this happen  tigh about 19 minutes ago  she said shes working on the details and well have a report at 1400  adama go talk to starbuck right away apollo my pleasure  adama and report back to me apollo yes sir  is there something to worry about madam president  why do you ask that   that look on your face  not now  starbuck take that out the chief said we need it but i dont  apollo lt thrace attention  i gave you a command you will obey it attention  you do not take your harebrained ideas to the xo  without going through me first do you understand  yes sir  at ease so whats the plan  im putting an autopilot in the raider jump him to the base ship  engage the autopilot punch out get picked up by a raptor  starbuck the raider heads to the base ship  except the transponder allows the raider to approach  nuke goes off  boom sir  might work might get you killed  would you miss me sir  i need every pilot i have  even the screwups  captain  im really sorry  billy if you do this it could threaten everything weve accomplished  it may bring down the government and you dont have a right  to risk that for a  go on  for a druginduced vision of prophecy  i am well aware of that  but it would seem that the gods have a different plan  roslin would you please get me lt thrace  can i get you some more water  yes thanks  you cant be serious  roslin all of this has happened before and will happen again  that cylon you interrogated he quoted that bit of scripture  he also said that we would find kobol  and kobol would show us the way did he not  yes he did  roslin we have found kobol  do you believe in the gods lieutenant  not that its any of your business but yes i believe  lieutenant i am not trying to put you on the defensive  i would like you to think this through with me  if you believe in the gods  then you believe in the cycle of time  that we are all playing our parts in a story  that is told again and again and again throughout eternity  thats the way i was raised  but that doesnt mean that my part in the story  is to go off on some crazyass mission against orders  may i tell you the part of the story that it would seem i am playing  i am dying   what  i have terminal breast cancer  i have six months at the outside to live and i have only told three people  so id appreciate it if you kept it to yourself  of course  are you saying that you are  the scripture tells us a dying leader  lead humanity to the promised land  if you go back to caprica and bring me the arrow  i will show us the way  this is crazy  people keep using that word it is crazy perhaps  that doesnt mean it isnt true  and it may be our only chance  our only chance  to find earth  the old man is our last chance to find earth  he knows where it is he said so you were there  the location is a secret but he is going to take us there    commander adama has no idea  where earth is he never did  he made it up in order to give people hope   youre lying  go ask him  i will    starbuck i need one more inflight test  for the autopilot and nav systems before i jump for kobol  adama right  can i ask you a question boss  shoot  how much longer till we reach earth  its hard to say  you got a guess  you know i dont like to guess  are we getting closer  im sure we are  adama good luck on the next test  apollo starbuck im ready over here  okay starbuck the board is green  copy that  powering up for the autopilot test  this is starbuck request permission to speak with galactica actual  starbuck wants to speak to you sir  shes on a scrambled channel  go ahead  i believed you believed in earth  what are you doing starbuck  bringing home the cag sir  we can talk about this  no i dont think so  i want you to remember one thing i do not regret anything that i did  be sure that whatever youre going to do you dont regret it later  do you understand me    i guess well find out  commander shes spinning up the raiders ftl drive  tigh what  this is an autopilot test what the hell is she doing  what are you doing kara  galactica apollo she just jumped away  repeat starbuck and the raider just jumped away  she wasnt scheduled for a jump test where the hell did she go    home
