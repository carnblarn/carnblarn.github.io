right  yes  i want to see the master at arms in my office in ten minutes  a cylon  hadrian eyewitness accounts state the bomber was a man  the cylons look like us now  like us  yes they appear human the flesh the blood  the whole thing  the bomber was another copy of a man we knew as doral  posing as the public relations officer aboard this ship  theyve learned that there are multiple versions of the same cylon  i want you to open an investigation immediately  i want to find out how that cylon or any civilian   could break through our security  theres been a string  of security incidents aboard ship sir  the water tank explosion the discovery of explosives aboard a raptor   and now this  your point    i need a free hand  the authority to follow evidence wherever it might lead  without command review   independent tribunal  yes sir  youll get it  hadrian thank you adama that will be all sergeant  i also strongly recommend alerting the public to the cylon threat  if there are other copies of this man aboard the fleet  we should find them before they strike again  ill take that under advisement  adama that will be all hadrian yes sir  open to the public theres a can of worms  keeping silent hasnt helped us very much  maybe shining a light on the situation will make things pop up  adama all right  adama hey  i owe you one   sir  colonel  get me the president  cally dont kink the line jammer there weve got it  socinus okay lets go  so whos first  how about me   hey chief  hows it going there on top   hi  come on lets have it come on  tyrol you people are the sorriest of the sorry  tyrol the dumbest of the dumb  tyrol the only thing youre making out of this  is a oneway trip to sick bay or the morgue  now tonight after night call  one of you brings me twice this length of copper tubing  a spot heater and a co2 scrubber  ill show you people how this is done  tyrol all right  now get the hell out of here before i change my mind  tyrol thank you  children  no 6 hes very handsome doral you really think so  boomer she says that about everyone no 6 you disagree  hes attractive  no 6 i hope youre more convincing than that with him  if he wants to find me hell head north toward cylon forces hes already seen  if he wants to go alone hell go south hoping to find another way off the planet  either way he wont make his move until nightfall  doral if he flees he dies  roslin theres going to be a huge reaction  if there are any other cylons  aboard any of our ships we need to find them  if we enlist the help of the public itll make it a lot easier  people are going to be shocked angry terrified paranoid  there is a price to be paid when asking for the publics help  theyre going to demand at the very least that someone be held accountable  im setting up a tribunal  that tribunal will have to come back to the public with a name  someone who screwed up  we dont know if anybody screwed up  a cylon agent penetrated your security killing three people  at least one of your men or women screwed up  look heres my view  independent tribunal openness transparency it all sounds great  but after 20 years in political office im telling you these things have a way  of inflicting damage on the people you least expect  i do not want a witch hunt on our hands  hadrian so where were you at the time of the bombing  in my rack reading some trashy novel socinus gave me   did you see the chief  chief  he was on the hangar deck going over some paperwork i think  hadrian how do you know that if you were in your rack    i saw him right before i turned in  i was with cally playing pyramid in the mess hall corridor  hadrian you sure jammer yeah shes pretty good   did you see the chief  yeah he was there  i mean not the whole time he dropped in watched us play for a while  okay  socinus i was on watch hadrian did you see the chief  the chief no   he wasnt on the hangar deck  no  wait yeah yeah he was  he came in did some work on one of the vipers that the captain rides  thank you   asleep in my rack  sure about that  positive  i was asleep sergeant  all right thatll be all for now  good afternoon and thank you for coming please be seated  im sure by now word of the explosion  on the galactica has spread to the entire fleet  we offer our continued gratitude to the brave men and women  aboard this mighty ship  in consultation with commander adama  i have appointed an independent tribunal  to investigate the circumstances surrounding this explosion  also in the interest of security and public safety  i feel it is time to reveal certain information that has until now  remained a tightlyguarded secret  this information was known only to myself commander adama   and a few select advisors  the cats out of the bag  the cylons have the ability to mimic human form they look like us now    roslin we have reason to believe that a cylon agent was responsible  for the explosions aboard galactica  this man has been identified as a cylon agent  we believe him to be responsible for the bombing  he evidently slipped aboard the galactica with a civilian group  killed a marine guard stole the explosives and detonated them  killing three members of the crew and destroying himself  roslin this man has also been identified as a cylon  and we now know that there are duplicates of each cylon model  anyone seeing either of these two men at anytime anywhere in the fleet  should immediately contact the battlestar galactica  and the office of the president  now ill take your questions    theyve known about this the whole time and they tell us now  cylon   i mean whos the cylon now  this is too much  i dont even want to know this  excuse me sir will you come with us please  boomer what why tyrol whats going on sergeant  hadrian chief we need you to come along as well  youre arresting the chief  socinus whos arresting him   no one is under arrest  whats all this  hadrian step back  lieutenant asked you a question sergeant  a tribunal has been convened  to look into the cylon penetration of our defences  it requires the presence of lt valerii and chief tyrol  i am here to escort them to the wardroom sir    very well  crashdown proceed hadrian thank you sir  lieutenant chief youll come with me please  youre it till i get back dont worry  hadrian lt valerii where were you at the time of the explosion  i was in my rack asleep  hadrian did anyone see you sir  boomer i dont know i was asleep  hadrian lieutenant  is it true that you and the chief are involved in a romantic and physical relationship  in violation of the colonial code of military conduct   i thought this was about  just answer the question please  are you and the chief involved in a relationship  no  the xo ordered us to put a stop to it and so we did    hadrian sir can you testify as to the whereabouts  of chief petty officer tyrol at the time of the bombing  i have no idea where he was   thank you sir  youre excused lieutenant  but i am sure he had nothing to do with the bombing  you are excused lieutenant  hadrian bring in the next witness please  hadrian the testimony you give before this tribunal may be used  to adjudicate your guilt or innocence in the matter under investigation  do you understand  yes  hadrian the matter being investigated is first  how a cylon penetrated galacticas security system  and second whether one of galacticas crew members  aided and abetted this crime through  conspiracy and collusion with the cylons  collusion with the cylons  hadrian do you consent to give your testimony freely without invoking  your right to remain silent as provided for under the 23rd article of colonization   i do  then lets begin    cally theyre going after the chief jammer theyre going after the cylons   what the hell does that mean  wake up  the worlds changed while you were asleep  socinus frak you  cylons look like people that means anyone anyone   not the chief  how do you know   i know  this is stupid  you two just dont want to deal with reality  jammer you want to keep your heads buried in the sand  thats exactly what the cylons want for us to turn on each other  cally start getting suspicious paranoid socinus shes right  if we dont believe in each other when the heat comes down were nothing  that kind of thinking is over its every man for himself now  you better watch your backs  hadrian you had the midwatch before the bombing correct  yes  would you please explain to the tribunal what you do on watch  tyrol i walk the perimeter of the hangar deck  the tool rooms storage facilities  to make sure all hatches are sealed  tyrol yes  that no unauthorised personnel is poking around where they shouldnt  thats right and there was no one on the hangar deck that night  hadrian i believe thats what your log says  what about the hatch combing for causeway c   anybody see you  no  i went through the hatch combing on c causeway  hadrian your log indicates that all hatches and portals were locked and sealed  if thats what the log indicates then thats the case  which would include the hatch combing for causeway c  i dont know where the sergeant is going with this  tyrol but theyre not related hadrian what if i told you that  i found the hatch open after the bombing  i would say that i dont know how thats possible  its not just any hatch on the hangar deck  it opens onto a causeway which leads directly to a small arms locker  where a marine guard was found dead at the scene  the locker was opened with the correct code  do you have the correct code to that locker chief  yes i do as do dozens of others including the guard  its possible the cylon forced the guard to open it before he killed him  i want to take this opportunity to state that that was an internal security matter  and this falls under the purview of the master at arms  and the master at arms is sergeant hadrian  did lt valerii leave the hatch combing open last night  i have no idea who left the hatch combing open last night  chief were you doing paperwork at the time of the bombing   no  were you working on a viper at that time  no  were you watching a pickup game of pyramid in the mess hall  at the time of the bombing  no as i told you earlier today i was asleep in my rack  hadrian then why do i have three different statements  from three of your deckhands  stating variously that they all saw you and you were anywhere but in your rack  chief tyrol where were you at the time of the bombing    hadrian were you in fact meeting with a cylon agent  i exercise my right under article 23  by invoking the 23rd article at this time the tribunal will look on this  as further evidence of your guilt so i will ask you one last time  who were you with at the time of the bombing  and was this person a cylon agent  hadrian your sworn statement indicates that you were on watch  at the time of the bombing and that you saw chief tyrol   work on one of the vipers is that true  yes sir  specialist can you explain to us why chief tyrol told us in his testimony  that he was in his rack asleep at the time of the bombing    hadrian speak up specialist socinus he said that  did you see him or didnt you  hadrian specialist socinus no i did not sir  so the chief did not come to the hangar deck after all  i dont know  i left my post  excuse me  i left my post sir  i ducked out to get a smoke  i went to the galley to get some chow the chief  i mean i dont know where he was  im sure he was asleep in his rack just like he said  you went to the galley  yes sir  did you go through the hatch combing on c deck  well to get to the galley that would be the best way  yes sir i went through that hatch   did you leave it open  im not sure  yes sir i think i did  the chief had nothing to do with it  it was me i left my post and i left the hatch open  it was me just me  you realise that by leaving the hatch open you allowed a cylon  to gain access to the small arms locker  yes sir  specialist did chief tyrol instruct you to leave the hatch open deliberately  as part of a conspiracy to allow the cylon to gain access to the small arms locker  the chief is innocent he didnt do anything  specialist did you leave the hatch open deliberately  yes sir  whatever happened it was me just me    south  you overestimated his willingness to risk himself for you  he just doesnt love you  wait  north toward his love  seems you made an impression after all  hes a good man he always does the right thing  are you prepared for the next step  yes   hello lieutenant  doctor  i brought you a cigar a recovery gift   how are you  im good  the food is good company is better  yes i just happened to be absolutely nowhere near sick bay  baltar i thought i would   see how you were doing  so doctor  your super secret projects on c deck right  im not at liberty to divulge exactly what i am doing on c deck  but youre more than welcome to pop by  once youre ambulatory   the bomber was on c deck right  yes i know i heard the explosion   very frightening  do you think thats where he was headed     im sorry i didnt follow you  the cylon bomber  do you think that he was trying to blow up your project  no 6 and you along with it  its funny  i hadnt thought of that  kind of hits you where you live huh  yes it does actually  you get well soon  baltar theyre trying to kill me  me always me theyre trying to destroy your work  no 6 destroying you is an added bonus baltar but why  baltar i dont understand why are they trying to blow me up  baltar you told me what to do  baltar i wouldnt be making this cylon detector if it wasnt for you  no 6 but im just in your head gaius  they dont know about me or us or our life together  how romantic  im going to have to destroy that cylon detector myself  blame the sabotage on cylon agents thats what ill tell adama    no you wont  youre gonna complete the project just like i told you  really would i  or what  dont make me angry gaius  you wouldnt like me when im angry  doral sharon  no 6 is that enough    no sharon wouldnt give up without a much earned fight      adama did you read the tribunal report roslin yes  and im sorry to read that one of your men has been charged with conspiracy   and collusion with a cylon agent  specialist socinus  but after reading the transcripts i have my doubts  what about this other man your chief tyrol he took the 23rd   what is that about do you think  its his right  the courts have never held that invoking the right to remain silent  can be used as evidence of guilt  you sound like a lawyer  my father was a lawyer civil liberties  lets set aside the legalities for a moment  obviously you are defending your man  i respect that i do but he is hiding something  chief tyrol has been under my command for over five years  and if he had really wanted to take this ship down  he could this is over      madam president im gonna have to call you right back  what  i have orders to bring you before the tribunal sir  lets go            helo its okay  boomer helo  whats happening  helo can you walk boomer i think so  helo come on i got you okay  now were even   i think we should go  right okay  helo come on  its going to be all right youre going to be just fine    hadrian commander adama when did you first learn the truth about the cylons  on ragnar station before we left  and you chose to withhold this crucial information sir  adama yes hadrian why  i felt that  to alarm the public would only cause chaos and panic  but  you also withheld the information  from your own security detachment aboard ship sir  not knowing who to trust i decided to keep the information  compartmentalised for the time being  sir isnt it true that had we known that the cylons appeared human  different security procedures would have been followed  probably  but i had to weigh the possible ramifications of both  hadrian isnt it also true sir that had different procedures been followed   the bombing may have been prevented  thats speculative   im asking if its possible  i know what youre asking sergeant  i will not speculate as to what might have happened  do you personally believe that  a cylon agent planted explosives in the ships water tank  yes  do you believe that there are cylon agents aboard ship even as we speak  yes i do  hadrian sir isnt it true that you knew  that lt valerii and chief tyrol were having an illicit relationship  in violation of regulations  i dont see the relevance of this line of questioning sergeant  the commander should bear in mind  that my questions are not subject to the commanders review  why did you allow the relationship to continue  knowing it was against regulations  im a soft touch  sir are you aware that both lt valerii and chief tyrol  have been implicated as possibly being in collusion with the cylons  im aware of the allegations where are you going with this  i will ask the questions sir  isnt it true that by allowing their relationship to continue  in violation of regulations  you may have made it possible for two cylon collaborators  to compromise the safety and security of this ship    were done here  excuse me sir but my questions are not finished  youve lost your way sergeant  youve lost sight of the purpose of the law  to protect its citizens not persecute them  whatever we are whatever is left of us  were better than that  adama now these proceedings are closed  youll be transported back to your ships and we appreciate your help  myson commander  this is an independent board you have no authority to close our inquiry  this is a witch hunt  i will not have it aboard my ship  corporal of the guard  restrain the commander and return him back to the witness chair  your orders are to escort sergeant hadrian back to her quarters  and keep her in confinement until further notice  make your choice son  sergeant hadrian youll come with us please  man shes just about to speak  woman yes i tried to get an interview with her myself  good evening have a seat  the investigation into the suicide bombing aboard galactica  and how it was allowed to occur has come to a close  you are all aware that the bomber was a cylon agent  the tribunal has determined  that the cylon gained access to the explosives  by going through a hatch door in the hangar deck of the ship  this door was left open due to negligence  of one of the ships crewmen  his name is specialist socinus  he has confessed to lying under oath and dereliction of duty in a time of war  he has been stripped of his rank and confined to the brig  at this point we have no reason to believe  that there were any other parties responsible  now ill take your questions you sir  tyrol commander permission to enter  adama what is it chief tyrol thank you sir  sir i believe that socinus  i believe that his confession was a lie i think that hes covering for me  for you  i think that hes doing this out of a sense of misplaced loyalty to me  somewhere in this theres truth care to take me to it  sir i was with lt valerii at the time of the bombing  the deck gang they all knew it theyve known all along  tyrol theyre trying to cover for me they started lying socinus  i think that he thinks hes helping protect me by taking a fall like this  you dont really know if he was on duty or not do you  commander hes innocent i know that much i should be in the brig  well thats a fact you should be in the brig  commander this isnt right   you cant let an innocent kid  i cant    what i cant do  is i cant let someone that wears this uniform  get on the witness stand and lie under oath  and thats what your man did  he either lied the first time or he lied the second time  and it doesnt matter  hes guilty and hell pay the price  adama you youll pay a different price  youll have to walk out on that hangar deck every day  knowing that one of your men is in the brig  because you couldnt keep your fly zipped  youre the most experienced noncommissioned officer we have left  you keep my planes flying  i need my planes to fly  dismissed  sir  tyrol sharon no boomer what  sharon were done its over   what do you mean its over  i love you  i really do  im sorry  wait a minute  boomer i deserve more of an explanation than that    sure  one of my men is in the brig  he confessed to a crime he didnt commit to protect me to protect us  there can be no more us no more secrets no more lies thats it  its over  i cant believe you can just turn your back on us  i put everything on the line for you  everything i cover for you i protect you  tyrol i risk my career my freedom my integrity for what   so some innocent kid one of my kids can take the fall for me  tyrol no  we are not worth that  okay  right  i guess ill see you around  one more thing  did you leave the hatch combing open last night  what  did you leave the hatch combing open last night  what are you saying  boomer that i helped the cylon tyrol i didnt say anything  im just asking a question i think i deserve an answer  you have the only answer youre ever gonna get
