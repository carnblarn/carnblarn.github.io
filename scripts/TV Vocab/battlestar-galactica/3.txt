accepted before without thinking  nice to hear im a big hit on campus  you werent the book was banned i read it anyway  point is i understand where youre coming from  but i dont think you understand how critical the situation is out there  people are gonna start dying  hey starke its time for your break  billy how can you say that dualla its the truth  zarek and the sfm they dont care about justice  billy his people your people have been exploited   you cant tell me about my people  im not telling you about your people  all i want the president wants  is to offer you a chance to earn

baltar really starbuck no     oh   i wonder if shes a real blonde  i doubt it  now one of you has been coming in a little hot lately  a little too hot a little i dont know  hes burning up the deck with his skids because  he cant pull back on the throttle who is the speed demon my prince  flattop sir    starbuck flattop you got a need for speed do you  cant wait to get back to the big g and the loving embrace of your fellow pilots  or maybe you have a hot date with your right hand  it never gets a headache  tell you what flattop you come in too hot today  you may have to start using your

boomer  1400 boomers in the tool room  a pilot blows his landings and you make a joke out of it  screaming at people doesnt always get the best results sir  i learned that at officer candidate school  you are right on the edge thrace careful you dont fall off  speaking of falling off    glad to see youve found a way to quench your thirst    they wont negotiate while youre holding hostages   i dont wanna negotiate  then what do you want  to be treated like men not animals   finally have something to bargain with  so what happens now   were gonna talk  what about  your father   is this a monclair original  yes  baltar fantastic adama would you like some water  yes thank you  im not a collector myself but i  i am familiar with his work and may i say  you really do have an excellent eye for art thank you     wheres my cylon detector doctor  oh that  yes its taking longer than expected unfortunately  whats the hangup  its not working this time gaius he can see right through you  there are a number of obstacles  none of them insurmountable but they do tend to slow us down  for a start the lack of proper facilities the water shortage of course  the water shortage not to mention  adama cut the bs  you said you had a way of detecting human from cylon  do you or dont you     i dont  what  i dont think that im the man for this job  baltar im not cut out for this kind of work   you have to do this  why do i keep putting it off  its my subconscious telling me  that im not the man for this job please  listen to me if you dont tell him what he wants to hear  hes going to find you out  and when he does theyre going to tear your head off  and throw your body out of an air lock  pardon me i havent had much sleep recently so    unfortunately doctor for both of us  youre the last man we have  so whats the game plan doc    this is what you say  commander the truth is there is one way   say it  commander the truth is  there is one way   i didnt wanna have to ask you for this  but what i really need to complete the project  is a nuclear  warhead  that how you got to be the personal representative of the president  zarek because of your father apollo hardly    so they dont get along adama and roslin  they have their differences  but not when it comes to dealing with terrorists  i thought you said you respected me read my book  that was before you resorted to violence and hostagetaking  always better when the oppressed dont fight back isnt it  a warhead  no 6 technically i need the plutonium inside  technically i need the plutonium inside  figure out the rest for yourself    as you may know the cylons are  susceptible to certain kinds of radiation  and by taking the plutonium  and embedding it in a carbon nanotube matrix  and it really is that simple  i can construct a filter that will preferentially ionise synthetic molecules  and thus deliver to you your cylons  we have five warheads left aboard this ship  adama we may need them baltar yes of course  if you really think that this project has a low priority  then youre totally within your bounds to    youll get your warhead  good boy  thank you commander  tyrol look the masteratarms has been over every inch of that locker  shes come up with nothing  boomer so theyve got no idea who took those six g4 charges   or who put that detonator in  dont worry about it  ill take care of it okay    i need to speak with the lieutenant alone    you dont honestly think youve been fooling everyone do you  i know the old man knows  tigh hell the whole ship knows about you and the chief  it stops now  sir the chief and i are just friends  when the ship was being decommissioned we let it go  hell we let people get away with murder that was then and this is now  were at war this is a combat unit and youre his superior officer  put a stop to it thats an order  yes sir  gaeta  attention pass the word for col tigh  col tigh please report to the cic    zarek  the crew are my prisoners they will not be harmed  adama are you recording this gaeta yes sir  tigh whats this adama trouble  zarek  but i have two conditions before i release my captives  first the government which controls our fate  is illegal and illegitimate  and it must submit to the will of the people  i demand the immediate resignation  of laura roslin and her ministers  second i demand free and open elections to choose a new leadership  and a new government that represents all of the people  these demands are made not for me or the former slaves held on this ship  but for you the people the survivors of the holocaust  and the children of humanitys future  i am tom zarek  and this is the first day of the new era   weve jammed his transmissions  a little bit late for that   every ship in the fleet heard that broadcast  it doesnt matter  it does matter hes trying to bring down the government  adama no onell take it seriously  you have something to learn when it comes to public opinion commander  tom zarek is a name with weight hes a very sympathetic figure a legend almost  twenty years in prison over a matter of principle  hes a criminal and a terrorist people wont give him credence  roslin dont be so sure commander  rebellions are contagious people are already rioting over the water crisis  we cant afford to destabilise this government right now  adama i agree roslin when are you going in  i assumed you were gonna talk to him first   we dont negotiate with terrorists  i said talk  theres nothing to talk about what he wants i cant give him  were not ready yet talking to zarek gives us a little bit more time  thats what he wants legitimacy he wants to be recognised  he wants his crimes validated  i watched president adar offer him a full pardon if hed apologise  and give up violence as a means of political change he refused     no commitments no deals  ill let you know what happens  three assault teams alpha bravo constellation  we jam their dradis the raptors cut through the hull here here and here  without being seen once were inside alpha takes  whats this we crap   im going sir  like hell  we have a few marines left on galactica   let them handle it starbuck  they dont have a sniper  with all due respect im the best shot in or out of the cockpit  shes right for once  wonders never cease  all right youre going in  you get a clear shot at zarek you take it i wanna control that ship immediately   and i want all the hostages alive  yes sir  i dont even know how i drew this detail   president thought youd be valuable  president doesnt know who i am  i told her sorry  on the other

frequent wireless contact  tigh keep us informed all the way starbuck yes sir  good hunting    who voted for laura roslin you did you vote for her   she was sworn in under the law  the answer is no one voted for her  and yet shes making decisions for all of us deciding who lives  and who dies is that democracy is that a free society  what is it you want from me  you want me to say she shouldnt be president we need a government   we need rules we need a leader  we need to be free men and women  if were not free then were no different than cylons    zarek they call you apollo apollo its my call sign  apollos one of the gods a lord of kobol  you must be a very special man to be called a god  its just a stupid nickname  son of zeus good with the bow god of the hunt  and also a god of healing  now a god  can reconcile those two opposing forces but a mortal  has to pick one side or the other  have you picked a side apollo  astral queen this is the battlestar galactica  commander adama wishes to speak to mr zarek   please respond   zeus is calling  zarek  commander adama tom zarek how can i help you  first i want to make sure that my people are unharmed  this is apollo im fine so are the others  apollo theyre located on the lower zarek thats enough thank you  im glad to hear that no ones been hurt  that would have tragic consequences   how long until you storm the ship  im hoping that wont be necessary  i think that you and i can come up with some kind of understanding  this is not the only crisis that im dealing with    the water shortage affects the entire fleet  your men are on their way even as we speak  theres still time to work this out  have the president step down and call for elections  thats not gonna happen  then i look forward to meeting your men       i

in a cell  now hes got a chance to go out in a blaze of glory  and hes gonna take it  alpha one were in    once roslin uses adamas soldiers  to massacre the people on this ship  prisoners and hostages alike  people in the fleet will never forgive them  the entire government will collapse   she can take care of herself  you sure  shes been trained weve all been trained in capture its    youve been

the moon  youve committed me to holding elections within a year  madam president with respect  youre serving out the remainder of president adars term  when that term is up in seven months the law says theres an election  i only committed you to obeying the law   you were not authorised to make any deal  you sound like a lawyer  i swore an oath to defend the articles  the articles say theres an election in seven months if youre saying  the laws out then im not a captain youre not a commander  and you are not the president  and i dont owe either of you a damned explanation for anything  hes your son  hes your advisor  an election  i guess you finally picked your side  adama madam president        what the hell is this water  bet your ass theres plenty more where that came from  i have my

great importance to me  that theres a future for the people  and i fear that knowledge of my illness will erode hope  so this has to stay between you and me   you can count on me  i know i can  youre capt apollo
