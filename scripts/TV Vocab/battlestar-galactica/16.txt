mission  search and rescue for who  we lose a plane and nobody tells me  for our raptor crew down on the surface of kobol sir  simes is senior pilot now he can plan the sar  you asked me to command the air group when im on duty and im on duty  so am i in command or not  whats the status of the sar captain  apollo well we dont know in what area raptor 3 went down  so the only realistic chance we have of finding her  is the hope that her transponder or disaster beacon is still functioning  i intend to take two raptors  one with medical personnel and make five lowlevel orbits of the planet  what about that cylon base ship that lt valerii supposedly destroyed  what if she was lying  racetrack confirmed the destruction of the base ship  and i checked the guncamera footage from the raptors which verifies it  lt gaeta why are you hovering about  its the press the press  theyre demanding to know how much longer we plan on holding them  and when they can contact their homeships  they demand theyre in no position to demand anything  you tell them to shut their yaps well get to them in due time  dualla excuse me colonel  shuttle from the zephyr has just requested permission to enter the landing pattern  the zephyr yes sir  evidently the quorum of twelve is aboard theyre demanding to see you  they demand  demanding job commanding a battlestar  clear them to land  put them in the ward room and hold them there until i have time to see them  stop  madam president whats wrong with her  i dont know but shes clearly sick you can see that cant you  but theres nothing i can do  madam president yes  can i get you anything while youre in the brig    billy  no thank you  im sorry  im finding it hard to think  its withdrawal  the chamalla yes  im trying to get you more go fast    i count six missiles being carried into the forest site so far  its all so pointless  we kill them and they kill us  so we kill more of them and  so they kill more of us whats the point anymore  you your race invented murder  invented killing for sport greed envy  its mans one true art form  youve done some killing of your own i think  yes well were your children you taught us well  why does god want to bring a child into this kind of world anyway  because despite everything despite all of it he still wants to offer you salvation  our child will bring that salvation but only if you accept your role  as her father and her guardian  im not ready for that all right  im not a father im not a guardian  im not a moral leader capable of leading anyone let alone a baby  be a man gaius  what  be a man whatever else you are you are that  the time is coming when youll have to act like one  tyrol wait a minute wait a minute eltee check this out  crashdown what do you got chief  east of the launcher you see that tree stump  what the hell is that it looks like a dradis dish  or at least a cylon version of a dradis dish  its probably salvaged from the nose cone of a ship  they are building an antiaircraft battery  antiaircraft for what there are no other aircraft around here  the galacticas gonna send a search and rescue team  when they do thats at least two raptors doing a low pass over the crash site  when those raptors come looking for us risking their lives to rescue us  the cylons will shoot them down  seven birds down for repairs three out on picket duty with the cap  com traffic sir  priority messages are on top cut to the chase captain  how long before you launch the sar come on dee these are all marked priority  sorry sir thats how they came in  im cannibalizing  should be up in the air in i dont know 90 minutes  we got men down on that frakking planet  get your head in the game you do your job or go back to the brig  are all the members of the quorum in the ward room  all 12 sir  dont suppose you want to do this for me  never was much at public speaking sir  so why are we here thats what i want to know  what exactly is going on we have been cooped up in  laura roslin suborned mutiny and sedition aboard this ship  she caused a key military asset to be lost at a critical moment  the commander felt he had no choice but to remove her from power  youve said that several times  well l you dont seem to be listening colonel  it does not matter what adama felt he had absolutely no authority  adama knew exactly what he was doing  he was paving the way to declare martial law  and usher in a military dictatorship isnt that right colonel  tigh i cant speak for the commander  hes still in surgery  well you seem to be giving the orders around here  so what exactly are you planning to do  are you declaring martial law absolutely not  i know for a fact that the old man hated the very idea of martial law  he believed in freedom and democracy and all that good stuff  well since this is still a democracy and all that good stuff  i move that the quorum demand immediate access to president roslin  excellent i second it  porter all those in favor  all aye  zarek aye  motion carries  colonel we demand immediate access to the president  i will take your demand under advisement  ellen madam president  anything that impedes that understanding  madam president  i have to consider laura  laura  hello hi  are you all right  i just came down to see if there was anything i could do for you  anything i can get you  i would like to have a conversation with my attorney could you arrange that  yeah sure right  laura do you know where you are  im in jail  whats my name have we met  im sorry excuse me  its just the ringing excuse me  the ringing  right  okay then take care      oh my gods ellen tigh  ellen  ellen  lords of kobol  crashdown the launcher looks like a simple point and shoot  no builtin guidance  tyrol ordnance appear to be standard shiptoship missiles  theyre modifying it for atmospheric flight  cally one cylon centurion walks the perimeter  stopping at regular intervals  baltar the dradis dish that controls the missiles  is on a 45 kg wavelength judging by the diameter  its guarded by two centurions i think  sorry doc did you say it was guarded by two centurions  yes i did  okay is the dradis guarded continuously or intermittently  i saw two centurions through the field glasses continuously for five minutes  in that time they didnt leave their post  so theres three toasters near the launcher two more out by the dish  thats a lot of cylons  you ever handle a weapon  who me no  im not a soldier crashdown  ill try to give you the most simple assignment  but im going to need every man  tyrol youre not suggesting we attack the cylons  we owe it to socinus and tarn to take those frakkers out before they kill anyone else  we have equal numbers we have the element of surprise  therefore we have the initiative  we can attack at a time and place of our choosing  eltee a word in private  hes crazy im not trained for this kind of thing  ive never fired a gun in my life  i havent fired one since basic  you i just joined to pay for dental school  basic ground assault was a long time ago for all of us  those arent training officers out there  theyre programmed killing machines we dont have any choice  galactica will definitely be sending a search and rescue party  its just a matter of time if we dont take out that launcher  we cant go up against an armed and defended position like that  theyll wipe us out in the first two minutes thats enough  chief look under the circumstances its important that you keep your cool  i dont believe ive lost my cool i disagree  look i dont want to attack the launcher either but its our duty  we owe it to the rescue party and we owe it to socinus and tarn  i fail to see what this has to do with socinus and tarn  maybe thats why im an officer and youre not  dismissed  crashdown this briefing will outline a plan of attack in five graphs  graph 1 situation  our situation is that we are stranded on kobol with a group of five cylons  who are planning to use an aau to destroy any sar aircraft sent to find us  there are no other friendly forces present  whats all this graph business graph 2 mission  its a five paragraph order to destroy the aau  its a basic command tool its taught at officer candidate school  its just not usually used this literally in the field  graph 4 execution  we will assault the cylon launch site from the northwest using  oh come on  this is absurd  what were taking on the cylon army are we us look at us  what with two rifles and a canteen  have you lost your mind thats enough doctor  is it look no disrespect but why are we always going uphill  does anyone else think that his plan is frakking nuts  ill tell you whats fair this is fair well have a show of hands  no absolutely not now everybody who thinks its unfair  this is not a democracy well its not  the eltees in charge the eltees in charge  no ifs no ands no buts he say we go we go  theres no questions weve already lost two men chief  how many more people are we gonna lose  you need to sit down and shut up right now  nobody tells me to shut up i am the vice president  you need to sit down and shut up right now  your briefing eltee  thank you chief  graph 4 we will approach the cylon launch site from the northwest  using natural ground cover to mask our approach  our objective is the command and control console  once we reach this position  cally youre gonna flank out to the left  making a feint on the cylon position  hopefully drawing their fire long enough for me and seelix  to flank out to the right and get a shot at the console  tyrol you and the vice president will stay at position one  provide covering fire for both flanking maneuvers  i have been given the opportunity to perceive from the scriptures  in peace i believe  this is ridiculous look  she obviously needs her medication i keep trying to tell anyone thatll listen  it sounds like shes talking about the scrolls of the prophet pythia  i suppose  pythia foretold the rise of a leader  a leader who would lead all humanity to salvation  so say the gods  you seem to know a lot about the scriptures  im from gemenon  we believe in the literal truth of the scriptures  cpl venner theres  a drug that priests sometimes use its called chamalla extract  i guess its happy hour  whats happy about it  yeah the old mans still in surgery    i got a boatload of politicians and press demanding to see laura roslin  let them yeah right  shes crazy i know  no no really saul  shes lost it i just went down to the brig to see her  you did shes completely nuts  she doesnt even know where she is anymore  youre kidding you should let them see her  the press the quorum all of them  i mean the little school teachers mind has gone byebye and the  vice president is either missing or dead  that leaves you in unchallenged command of this ship and this fleet  just until the old man gets back on his feet  well of course  apollo galactica apollo we are preparing to jump to kobol  roger that apollo you are cleared to jump good hunting  thank you galactica lets go find our people  okay cock the rifle click the safety open the scope  cock the rifle click the safety open the scope  cock the rifle  no 6 one of you will turn against the others  during the mission yes  one of us will betray the others yes  during the attack yes  but if the attack fails youll die  not me i am gods instrument  god turned his back on kobol  turned his back on man and the false gods he worshipped  what happens on kobol is not his will  crashdown saddle up  its time to junk some toasters    xo dualla combat dualla here sir  the quorum is demanding to see the former president  theyre being pretty adamant and theyre giving the sentries a hard time  well maybe we should tell them to shove their demand up their collective asses  how about that  yes sir i need instructions for the sentries  theyre asking how to respond  tell them that they are going to get to see  what has become of their precious president you tell them that  i got a transponder signal definitely colonial  trying to establish a lock  got it  northern hemisphere looks like mountainous terrain  theres a valley  take us out of orbit  signal raptor 2 to form up on us  there they are all three of them right where theyre supposed to be  all right people this is it were going in  cally you move up the tree line to point alpha  whoa eltee theres five cylons at the launcher  what  somethings wrong isnt it somethings wrong with the plan  quiet down theres nothing wrong  theres just a couple cylons that we didnt account for  that makes for seven cylons five here and two up at the dish  are you absolutely certain about the two guards at the dish  i know what i saw  maybe there are only five cylons they just changed their deployment  they brought the two that were guarding the dish down here  now the dish is unprotected  god chief that dish is like almost a klick away  so what its unprotected we can go take it out  we dont have to take on the whole cylon army    what the hell was that sonic booms  spacecraft entering the upper atmosphere  its the sar mission theyre here theyre right up there chief  we got to go theres no time for discussion  all right everyone up move out its game time  were taking out these toasters before they kill any more of us    cally i said move i cant  what thats an order  she doesnt

welcome    viewing time at the zoo  glad to see you hold the president in such high esteem  your days gonna come laughing boy lets go  porter what is she saying  bagot i dont know shes not saying anything  i dont know what to do  i feel like shes  all right the shows over lets give her some privacy  everybody out lets go back to the ward room  and well talk about the business of how we proceed from here  thank you all for coming i have a statement id like to make  the attempted military coup against the lawful government of the colonies  is illegal illadvised and clearly doomed to failure  i have not resigned the presidency and i will fight this action  with everything at my command  shes crazy shes nuts  she thinks shes a prophet or some such nonsense  go ahead and ask her ask her shell tell you  just listen to her what was it the arrow of apollo  will open the tomb of artemis or some such nonsense  everything i have done is consistent logical  we have found kobol we have found the city of the gods  and when we retrieve the arrow we will open the tomb of athena  and we will find the road to earth  madam president have you read the scrolls of pythia  carefully and many times and i humbly believe that  i am fulfilling the role of the leader  okay enough of this nonsense everybody out  i dont think so wait a minute wait a minute  sarah you represent gemenon you know more about the scrolls  and the scriptures than anybody else here why dont you speak up  the scrolls tell us that a dying leader will lead us to salvation  shes not dying shes crazy  i am dying  i have terminal breast cancer dr cottle will verify the diagnosis  i have a few months to live  and in that time i will lead the people to salvation  it is my sole purpose  praise be to the gods  here is our salvation  sergeant of the guard sergeant yes sir  remove these people from the brig and escort them back to their shuttle    thank you corporal thank the gods    its a hell of a butchers bill chief  how did crashdown die leading the charge  he gave his life in the finest tradition of the service  yeah he was a hero to the end    im so proud of you gaius  why  because ive taken a life it makes you human  is it  not conscious thought  not poetry or art or music literature  murder murder is my heritage  is that the lesson im supposed to pass on to our child  itll be all right gaius  hey doctor lets go doctor come on we got to go  ill be your conscience  apollo come on doctor we got to get out of here  hell live  when will he wake up  knowing him when he damn well wants to probably  i really frakked things up for you bill  the events which took place aboard colonial one are unfortunate  laura roslins actions in suborning mutiny and sedition  among the military could not be tolerated  therefore commander adama was left with no choice  other than to remove her from office  miss roslin is now resting comfortably aboard this ship  where she will remain until such time as the commander deems otherwise    as it appears obvious that the government  cannot function under the current circumstances  i have decided to dissolve the quorum of twelve  and as of this moment i have declared martial law    get those people the hell off my ship yes sir
