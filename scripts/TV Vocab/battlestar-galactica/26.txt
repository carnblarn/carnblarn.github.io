                previously on battlestar galactica  citizens  i give you your new vicepresident doctor gaius baltar  youre the father of my child  and nothing is ever gonna change that  i know a place where you can stay  where you will be safe  how much time do i have   weeks a month at the outside  unless the cancer goes to your brain that happens you  im afraid the tests are positive  the mass is malignant its advanced well beyond the left breast  im afraid the test is positive  ms roslin  the surgery of course to remove the mass  secretary roslin   yes   naylin stans from the education alliance  you said you wanted to talk   yes  im sorry mr stans  i have to admit i was surprised to get your message  the president was surprised i sent it  once our chief negotiator got a billy club to the head  we figured adars government had written us off as a lost cause  i was a teacher long before i was secretary of education  and causes are only lost when we give up  madame president   can you hear me   lets make her as comfortable as we can  oh gods  season 2  episode 13 epiphanies  starbuck zero four niner cap is away  galactica roger that  zero four niner save flight  safe and 20 frackin minutes late  did you have a rough night starbuck   youre way out of line  just follow my lead  and save the attitude for someone who cares  kat six seven zero roger that  request permission to clear guns  roger that kat  clear your throat  damn it  weapons malfunction galactica  kat you good   im good im good  what the hell just happened   your wing guns out just keep it steady were heading home  galactica this is starbuck im declaring an emergency  weve got two bent birds requesting priority clearance to land  starbuck galactica flight deck is yours  why dont you just shoot us in the locker room chief   save the wear and tear on the ships  kats guns are clean i checked em myself  yeah well i dont believe in accidents  chief  somethings not right  the weights off its too light  i found three more just like it  mixed in with the regular rounds  casings been weakened  falls apart in the barrel next one hits it  bang shes lucky she didnt lose her whole wing  one bad rounds a fluke  more than one sabotage pull em all  all right you heard the chief lets pull em all go  hows the president doing doc   shes dying  and she knows it  i offered her a shot of morpha to ease the pain but  she wouldnt hear of it  tests are positive  mr president the terrorists  mr president we should at least speak with the strikers  before sending in the troops theyre teachers not terrorists  theyre acting like thugs  their last demonstration put two policemen in the hospital  six of them have chained themselves outside the hall of education  as far as im concerned theyre criminals  their pay is substandard their schools are falling apart  and the strike action has been gaining momentum for months and you know that  i dont understand why were not at least talking to them  one of the most interesting things about being president  is that you dont have to explain yourself  to anyone  youve already set a meeting with stans havent you   obviously only if you approve mr president  shes really not in a fit state to do anything  let alone conduct any government business  dont talk about me as if im not here  therell be plenty of time for that soon enough  billy could you  of course  gentlemen i called you here to discuss  the cylon dr cottle would you  would you please tell them what you told me this morning   im no expert in genetics but i can read a blood test  that cylon fetus  is showing some very peculiar genetic abnormalities  i havent seen any of this on your report doctor  no  well as dr cottle says hes not an expert  and i am  ive been through the tests  and i wouldnt say that there was anything conclusive  didnt say conclusive just damned odd  right  madame president  as you know the sharon cylon  is of considerable tactical value to the fleet  perhaps youve gotten too close to your subject doctor  this is difficult so im going to cut right to it  allowing this thing to be born  could have frightening consequences  for the security of this fleet  i believe the cylon pregnancy must be terminated  before it is too late  madame president id like  i thought you of all people would understand admiral  madame president  i dont understand this makes no sense  one of the interesting things about being president  is you dont have to explain yourself to anyone  thank you gentlemen im a little tired  gentlemen  i dont want to seem alarmist but i am perturbed  i think that the presidents illness is affecting her judgment  especially when it comes to the subject  she seemed reasonably coherent to me  then ill have to appeal to you on scientific grounds  destroying this child would seriously impact my studies of the cylon subspecies  the president made the call and im backing her  with all due respect the president made the call  based on evidence presented by dr cottle  pull yourself together  youre about to become president of the colonies  youre going to be asked to make some very hard decisions  act like you can handle it  gods  where have you been   where have i been   i never left you gaius  oh right yeah  yeah metaphorically speaking  its just that it was weeks ago and i  im sure youve suffered mightily in my absence  you know jealousy is a really ugly emotion  what is this lingering controversy over my affair with  your threedimensional duplicate  im not jealous im concerned  oh yeah  concerned about what  our child  now youre concerned  well for your information the president intends to kill it  once roslins gone youll be president  you can use your new authority to save our child  oh like thats gonna did you see the way adama looked at me  the contempt on his face  i will be the president all right  but without the military support i might as well be an anointed dog catcher  yes well you have your own resources if youd use them  what   you dont know what i mean  no i dont know what you mean  the nuclear device  the one adama provided for your research  there is one way  i didnt want to have to ask you for this  but what i really need to complete the project  is a nuclear warhead  is a nuclear  warhead  youre totally insane  im trying to help you you idiot  if adama remains committed to the destruction of our child  it may be our only hope  theres no easy way to say this  its about the cylon  the president has decided  that her pregnancy will be terminated  what  why  doc cottle discovered some anomalies  in the fetal blood work  isnt that expected  maybe  but the president believes  that to allow the baby to come to full term  constitutes an unacceptable risk to the fleet  i dont understand  sharons only helped us  since she came back from caprica she even turned on her own  to save her life  dont mistake the will the live  for genuine compassion lieutenant  shes still the enemy  does she know  not yet  then i should be the one to tell her  if thats all sir  helo  i dont expect you to agree to the decision  but i need you to accept it  were talking about my child sir  a part of me  but i guess its easier to kill when you call it a cylon  dismissed  so youre saying someones been tampering with our ammunition  shells dont unload themselves  whats this i hear about you ordering both  galactica and pegasus fighters to stand down  price you pay for reinstating me as cag sir  maybe that was a mistake  maybe i dont give a damn what you think  take it easy both of you  fact is weve been sharing stories between the ships  and nobody flies combat until our ammo supplies check out  leaving us defenseless if the cylons decide to pick a fight  we were defenseless before this we just didnt know about it  lee find out who did this  all right  excuse me im looking for asha janik  asha shes over there  lets do this quietly  asha janik  captain adama  i have a message for your father  they may take me  okay stop her  but i am one of many  we have declared war against galacticas armies of death  the cylons arent our true enemy  its the military that refuses to negotiate  all we want is peace  demand peace  demand peace  so much for being discreet  we found  these pamphlets in janiks quarters  some kind of a  manifesto  demand peace from the cylons  who the hell are these people  cylon sympathizers  just had no idea they were this organized  i want to know how she got aboard my ship  the hangar decks shortstaffed  weve been forced to import civilians to handle some of the grunt work  apparently shes um  shes a picon worked maintenance on the greenleaf no known criminal affiliations  until now now listen to this  do not be afraid we are not terrorists  but we will not sit back while adamas war machine  continues to press us into cruel and futile conflict  gods damn it  our demonstrations worked news is already spreading across the fleet  i know  we were contacted by a person claiming to speak  for the subversives demanding a meeting on the galactica  theyve got stones ill give them that  well ive agreed  what  were not negotiating  i just want to know what were up against  are you all right madame secretary  considering the stakes you dont seem particularly engaged  the stakes are what we decide to make them mr stans  if the president uses troops to enforce us back to work order people will get hurt  even die  some causes are worth dying for  not this one  the mass is malignant  doctor  admiral  i am royan jahee  you have a unique way of welcoming visitors to your ship  visitor my ass we shoot people like you for treason  colonel im only an interested party trying to prevent more bloodshed  i deplore what happened aboard your vipers  how many sympathizers do we have aboard this fleet  if youre trying to crush an organization  you can stop now  the people in this movement are following an idea  not a leader  what the hell do they want  peace with the cylon  you want us to surrender  they attacked us  only after wed enslaved them  you call yourselves military men strategists  explain to me how our current course of attack and retreat leads to victory  you can play innocent bystander but i think you know more  than youre telling us either way youre a danger to this fleet  admiral arresting me isnt going to stop any of this  maybe not  but its a start take him away  all right get your rubber gloves on  this is everything from the janik womans quarters  somehow the admiral thinks looking through this craps  gonna tell us something new about their socalled movement  so  havent seen much of you since your space walk  hold it  what is this  whats a deckhand need with a portable library reader  the daru mozu  a tylium refinery  and janiks used to explosives  this is the cag  get me a tac team ready right now  i dont understand why are they doing this now  i dont know  the admiral said they found something in the babys blood  somehow president roslin considers it a threat to the fleet  it cant just be that  ive done nothing but help them since ive come here  ive held back my anger  ive tried to show them that cylons are not all the same  that were not all murderers  deep down  i think theyre still afraid of you  yeah  afraid  they wanna be afraid of something  yeah  just let them come  letem  let them try to take my baby  just let them try to take my baby  sharon stop  sharon please dont do this please  listen to me listen to me  listen to me  sharon look at me  letgo  easy easy  when we land move fast  were looking for explosive devices set near the darus ftl drive  captain im getting something on the wireless  i think its coming from the daru mozu  none of us want to die  but the fighting must end  if my sacrifice sends a signal to the cylon that brings peace  then it was worth it  i do this for my children and for the children that will follow them  gods willing demand peace  pull out pull out  demand peace  pull out pull out pull out  people are dead  i grieve for them admiral  and i assure you the tyliums ships just a taste of whats in store  unless someone starts listening  you listen and you listen well  i dont care if i have to interrogate every civilian on board this fleet  this is gonna stop  do you understand   yes  mr vice president president roslin insisted on your taking the tour  shed like the transition to go as smoothly as possible  what are these   cylon agent suspects sir  that number means everything to her  represents hope thats our future  yes yes  being the president is  a lot of responsibility  its tradition for outgoing presidents to leave a letter for their successor  its usually opened on the first day of the new term but  the next few days are liable to prove  hectic so  well lets just pray that she gets better  lets  excuse me  yes  mr vice president   hello  yes  yes  i understand  thank you  i was told i might meet an old friend here  its good to see you gaius  so youve become a member of the peace movement   well despite what you may think  ive always abhorred violence  would you excuse us  please  do they have any idea what you are   of course not even their dedication has limits  i miss you  you look amazing  i cant believe  how real you are  whatre you doing   i havent stopped thinking about you since the second i left the pegasus  no no  i cant get you out of my head  dont do this  not yet gaius  i cant help myself i cant  im sorry  im sorry im just not ready  so is there any reason in particular for inviting me around here   because you saved me  let me save you  here we go again  what are you talking about   you must sense it  gaius the fleets crumbling  people are turning on each other there are serious misgivings about the military  when youre president  you can use the office to turn them against adama  paving the way for the cylons to save us  i would love to be with you always but  i know its hard but its the only way  no  i am not who you think i am  and i will not be responsible for the destruction of mankind  if you would have caught it sooner maybe we could have done more  laura come in  i didnt like the way we left things this morning  richard i  i know  youve been thinking this is a mistake for a while now  i just met with stans  the education alliance is going to back off  back off   laura what did you give them   i made them a promise that we would seriously hear out their grievances richard  i thought youd be happy theyre going back to work  youve put me in a very awkward position  i dont see how  both sides gave ground  its not just about your teachers  its the next strike im worried about  you just showed them that if they hold out long enough this administration will cave  you expected me to fail  i expected you to hold the line  this doesnt have to be the end of the world  you can stay on in an advisory capacity gods know we need your ideas  youre asking me to resign   i dont have any choice  this isnt about you and me anymore  youre right its not  you were willing to attack those people  and up until a few hours ago i was prepared to let you  i am on my way to the galactica to represent this administration  when i return if you still want my job be prepared to fight  when i return if you still want my job be prepared to fight  notify the admiral  this is admiral adama  as you know president roslin  has been aboard galactica  for the last few days  shes a fighter  but as of this moment her prognosis is grave  i know that many of you believe in the power of prayer  if that is your way then i urge you  to pray for our president  as for the others i hope you will join me  in keeping her in our thoughts  admiral please dont do this  stand down everyone  give me room  think about what youre doing helo  youre a soldier  im a father like you  please sir  give me a raptor let me take her off the ship  ill get her away from the fleet  i cant do that son  admiral admiral  admiral  doctor get the hell outta here  admiral  i must talk to you concerning the cylon child  it seems i may have been  wrong  very wrong  when i said that dr cottle misinterpreted the fetal blood work  see i had another look at those samples and i discovered something  quite intriguing  understand cylon blood is virtually impossible to differentiate from our own  that being said obviously it has to be slightly different because the cylon is not human  if um  if our blood  looks like this  for example  and the cylons blood looks like this  then its fair to assume that the cylon human is carrying an amalgam  is this a theory or fact  the cylons fetus contains no antigens  it has no blood type  thats what dr cottle was talking about when he said it was damned odd  except its not damned odd its astonishing  now knowing as we do that the cylons are built slightly better to endure  than their human counterparts i wonder could the cylon blood also be  blessed shall we say blessed  with a heightened resistance to disease  so  i applied  a sample of sharons fetal blood  to some cancer cells i took from the president  what am i looking at  nothing  thats the whole point  the cancer was gone and it was gone within a matter of hours  are you saying you found a cure for the presidents cancer  well its untried  its obviously untried and therefore extremely dangerous but yes  its possible  if you abort sharons fetus now  youll never know  now you may feel a sharp pain  sharon its okay its gonna be all right  i dont like what youre doing i think its unnatural and damned dangerous  yes well  given the patients current condition i am not sure that i see the downside  maybe its just her time  then for once  perhaps i am the beacon of hope around here  its alright everythings gonna be okay  right here with you sharon  if you want to settle this your people have to disengage  no more civil disobedience  no more acts of violence  i want our students back in school  done  im glad you called madame secretary  me too  im afraid the tests are positive  the mass is malignant  whats happening  move move damn  shes convulsing nurse get me 10 ccs  help me get her on her side  nurse nurse  no hold it  ill be damned  madame president  dr baltar  its so very good to see you  no no dontdont move dont move  madame president very good   hows she doing doctor  ive never seen anything like it  itll be a while before shes a hundred percent but  her scans are clear  cancers gone  are you sure  its gone  thank you  thank you  admiral  you seem better  much  are you still holding the spokesman  from the new faction in the brig  yes  would you take me to him please  certainly  thank you  ill wait for you to get dressed  president roslin  mr yahee isnt it  i thought it was time we met  would you open the door please  do it  all these people want is to be heard  a member of your group nearly destroyed our tylium refinery  before we can even begin to talk i need your personal assurance  that there will be no more attacks  as i told the admiral i have had no direct contact  genuine negotiations require trust  do not lie to me  ill talk to my people  make them understand  excellent and ill listen  maybe even act but if you renege  ill insist the admiral hunt you and your friends down without mercy  you seem very content  sharons child is safe  adama and roslin have agreed that more  study is required before any  drastic measures are taken  yes but by saving roslin youve denied yourself your rightful place of leadership  there are many aspects of you gaius  i will never understand  you wouldnt  neither would i suspect your corporeal counterpart  do you love her  what is that  the letter roslin wrote me  to be opened upon the event of her death  president baltar i offer my sincere congratulations  thank you  i say that knowing weve had our differences  and that you take office despite my many reservations  you may be the most brilliant person ive ever met  but your intelligence is unleavened by compassion  you must be reminded of your ethical responsibilities  and challenged to rise aboveyour own selfish needs  i dont write this to hurt you  but to beg you to open your heart  understand that the people in the fleet look to you not just for leadership  but for solace  justice  find a way to give them that  and you will be a great leader  laura roslin  after all ive done for the fleet after all ive done for her  roslins never trusted you  shes undermined you at every turn and now  so now we know shes never gonna trust me  this is not a political struggle anymore gaius  this is quite litterally life and death  the president assured me that as long as there are no further acts of violence  shes willing to bring our concerns to the quorum and admiral adama  shes trying to buy time  shell never be open to negotiating with the cylons  i disagree  i think weve made real progress today  and so does the vice president  baltar  yes  just before i left he asked to meet with me  he encouraged patience while he works with roslin from within  and he offered the contents of this case as proof of his sincerity  whats in it  i dont know  he said that you should be the one to open it  frack
