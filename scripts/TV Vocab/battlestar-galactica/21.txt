the gideon massacre  appears to show galacticas marines firing indiscriminately  into a crowd of unarmed civilians  four dead 12 wounded  and yet as of today not a single charge has been filed  against any of the marines involved nor their commanding officers  this is danna biers reporting  danna thats gonna blow this thing wide open  we need some stock footage of raging marines  we can intercut that with the eyewitness statements    youve no right to come in here like this  maam youre to come with us  what am i under arrest no maam  and what if i refuse to go  hello miss biers  its nice to see you welcome to colonial one  madam president its an honor  cmdr adama where did you get the tape  from an anonymous patriot  so is this a social call or are we on the verge of another coup  funny  just something to break the ice  i take it im here because you are unhappy with my story on the gideon massacre  what happened aboard the gideon was a tragedy  but it was not a massacre  but the tape shows your men firing into a crowd of defenseless civilians  my marines tell a different story  not to me  ive submitted a dozen interview requests all denied  well thats about to change  youve been lobbying to do a story on the galactica for months  cmdr adama has agreed to give you unlimited access to his crew and his ship  thats right unlimited access  all access wont buy you a propaganda piece  we dont want one  miss biers this tape of yours  has put fuel on a fire that was about to die  people are angry they are distrustful of the military  yeah with good reason maam  in some cases with good reason  but i want to show the people what life aboard the galactica is really like  i want to put a human face on the officers and the crew  who protect us against cylons and guard our freedoms every day  you might not like that face when you see it  what would that be  all we really want is a balanced story  show us what the men and women of galactica are really like  thats it thats it  and i need you to do it now before we tear each other apart  the cag had better start cracking some heads  half our supply runs are behind schedule    combat dualla  colonel its

about a dozen co2 scrubbers aboard galactica  they all work  get a closeup of that would you bill yeah sure  we just finished a 15hour rotation  yeah well you better get used to it  we may be short on pilots till the rest of the fleet pulls the stick  out of its collective fat ass    more fallout from tighs moment of glory  you heard about his death threat  couldnt have happened to a nicer guy    i

seen all we need to see here  whose brilliant idea was that  how did your family respond  my dad went crazy when i enlisted  he thought the military was a joke  a refuge for emotional cripples and patriotic fools  but you signed up anyway  i guess i just wanted to believe in something  you think itll give it more memory  yeah it seems pretty simple maybe just a basic adjustment  its a pretty good piece yeah its kind of old  danna maybe i need a new one  what the hell is going on i dont know  you dont know im the vice president  shes supposed to be interviewing me isnt she  well of course she should your title alone commands respect  of course it does its a rare commodity around here  i mean im the vice president  im not going beg ill tell you that much  dualla miss biers our next stop

 hello  hi danna biers fleet news service  oh youre the reporter  thats right cmdr adama said the news service might be joining us  i suppose youre  well very busy doing a lot of interviews i would imagine  well i would love to speak to you  if youve got a second we can do it now  no im afraid not i am very busy  really really busy at the moment snowed under  but if you get in touch with one of my aides there might be a small window tomorrow  im not promising anything honestly  but i might be able to give you an interview then  if thats what you would like  good good well you justcarry on  what a strange little man  danna capt adama  i hardly recognized you with your clothes on  look im sure you thought it was clever  busting into the pilots duty locker but the areas offlimits for a reason  its the one place where my people can unwind be themselves  you seem to think that your pilots deserve special consideration  actually i do  like everyone else  my pilots have lost their families their friends  everyone they ever cared about  but on top of that they are asked to put their lives on the line  every single day  for a fleet that seems more interested in what they do wrong  than in what they do right  theyre not asking for your pity but they damn well deserve your respect    gods chief weve already run this up twice  yeah something doesnt feel right what  something doesnt feel right well hurry up    thats it great  oh thats fantastic thats just great  i knew it how did i miss that  maybe if your knuckledraggers spent more time on maintenance  and less time frakking around  this knuckledragger just saved your ass sir  why dont you say that a little louder chief  i dont think the camera heard you  you know what frak the camera youve been riding my  dont even try defending for no frakking reason  knock it off  chief fix the ship  yeah fix the hey  what hey enough  chief fix your ship you get the hell out of here now  get the camera out of my face    she has been pissing me off all week what the hells going on  im taking her off rotation until she gets her head rewired i mean  cant do it we need the pilots  besides if i scratched everyone who popped off at the chief  the cooks would be flying the missions son of a bitch  did you get all that you happy come on  walk away  we were never trained for crowd control  first order of business when under attack is defend yourself and your squad  but these were civilians  i have 10 stitches that say we were under attack  truth is it was a command frakup the moment tigh put us on that supply ship  im not surprised someones trying to take out that drunk son of a bitch  all right private belay that col tighs been threatened  no this interviews over shut that off  commander watch your step please  okay come on  sitrep  fleets quiet no enemy contact for the last 10 days  no cylon contact anyway  well they have their job to do we have ours  did you hear about the meeting on cloud nine  reps flying in from every vessel in the fleet  for a kingsize bitch session yeah ive heard  well they sent us an invitation to send a delegation  youre it  do you mind danna no no go ahead  were in  im not exactly the most popular guy in the fleet right now  well itll be good then to let your cutters know that youre not afraid of them  that what you think ive been hiding  what the hell is going on here bill  youve been doing this too long we were worried about ulterior motives  youre going because youre not afraid and people should see that  plus itll also give people a chance to vent their feelings  instead of seething in private  and finally i think you need a little rr  so consider this mandatory shore leave  take a swim get some sleep  sir and  stay away from the bar  three theres three so you got lots  starbuck good luck colonel have fun on cloud nine  you bet    initiating preflight  whats going on abort launch everybody out now    everybody back get back now  whats going on  the main bus is totaled looks like somebody took a hammer to it  if this had blown in transit the cabin would have vented to space  someones trying to kill you saul comes with the stripes  its because of that damned gideon incident  ellen we dont know that of course we do  danna biers left two messages already  shes giving you the chance to tell your side  i dont have to explain myself especially to her  roslin wants to placate the fleet  put the great bill adama back on his pedestal  the fastest way to do that is by hanging you out to dry  why do you think adama wanted to send you to cloud nine  the gideon happened on my watch  yes  but you didnt order those jarheads to open fire   this is so like you saul  always the proud soldier taking the heat because its honorable  when are you going to realize were all alone out here    danna are you afraid when you go into combat  first thing they tell you is to assume youre already dead  well that sounds ghoulish  yeah maybe  but dead men dont get scared or freeze up under fire  me im just worried that hells going to be a lonely place  and im gonna fill it up with every toaster son of a bitch i find  whats been the hardest for you  they try to turn off the human part of you because thats whatll get you killed  but when youre out in the field its not that easy  nothings that easy  guard you got five minutes  sharon its me  sharon  give me your light what the hell are you talking about  give me your light now somethings wrong  oh gods call dr cottle  helo now    danna does that help you cope with the stress  not really  look all that i ever wanted was to be an officer on a battlestar  okay i trained my whole life trained harder than anyone in my unit  basically i put my life on hold until i was assigned to galactica  then the cylons hit and i realized that this is all that i know  tech manuals commands and tactics  you know im not saying that im unhappy  just wondering if theres something more  and what have you discovered  i hate cigarettes    ambrosias good with a chaser  and if you have enough ambrosia  they dont really hurt that much  there you go well make this as painless as possible  drink  is this an interview or a cocktail party  are you kidding this is how we keep it painless  just like to keep it casual thats all  please  cheers colonel cheers  before we begin  i had heard rumors that that you had death threats  ieveled against you is that right  this is a military vessel we have rumors for every occasion  was it hard for you to take over your friends command when he was shot  i didnt take anything command fell to me and i did my duty  but you were in full command of galactica for more than a week  and in that time there were a number of controversial actions taken  youre talking about the gideon  i made a military decision  given the same circumstances id do it again  so you have no regrets whatsoever  youre trying to set me up  colonel why do you think there was no official investigation  into the gideon massacre  please come get out of my face  did you get that got it  someones a mean drunk  great i could use a sparring partner  sorry i didnt bring my gloves too bad  capt adama said that i could ask you about the new pilots  yeah well capt adama likes to push my buttons    so what do you look for in a new recruit    coordination  good reflexes  total commitment    most of all someone crazy enough to follow me into combat  danna colonel why do you think  there was no official investigation  into the gideon massacre  please come get out of my face  i want to apologize for col tighs behavior it was uncalled for  seems like a lot of people have been  apologizing for him over the years commander  so level with me  why is col tigh not being charged in the gideon incident  were at war against an enemy  with a vastly superior force  i will not sacrifice the few people we have left on the altar of public outrage  so four civilians are dead  and tigh and the shooters take a walk  nobody takes a walk  we all gotta live with it  kelly viper fiveninerone galactica  you are cleared into the break  portside landing bay handson approach  checkers are green

restricted area  guard commander shes over here  cmdr adama that woman looks just like the late lt valerii  the tape please  why would galactica be harboring a cylon the tape  did the baby survive  you understand that even a hint of this could be devastating  to the morale in the fleet you are the master of understatement  you know after the gideon this could turn the entire fleet against you  then the real question is whether or not it matters to you  you know i am sick to death of people like you questioning my patriotism  we all want this fleet to survive  i think youre doing very well  very well under the circumstances  i understand this has been a difficult job for you  i mean i hear that your reports havent exactly  ingratiated you with the commander have they   or the rest of the crew for that matter  still luckily as a member of the civilian government  im here to assure you that i have no such reservations  i think most of the crew understands im just doing my job  as are we all all just doing our jobs arent we  im just doing my job youre just doing your job  okay cut to the chase gaius  tell her why you deserve to lead this fleet  as i myself discovered when i was stranded  stranded on kobol  i found that the stress of survival revealed  ieadership qualities that previously i didnt even know that i possessed  really yeah  i understand your party took several casualties  yes that was very unfortunate  they were heroes every one  you know what im ready shall we shoot this one    oh its probably just a false alarm ignore it youre okay  bill you take the hangar deck im gonna take the clc go  please youre as safe as houses down here really  man on pa system incoming cylon raiders this is not a drill repeat  thats showbiz  what have we got two raiders

harder  thank you  was 15 degrees sixteen  so howd it go out there  well we didnt lose anyone thats a good day  ellen  im not sure ive found a story in all this yet  go back a bit  yeah there  i know that book  thats by kataris  whats wrong colonel need a drink      you can go to hell  ive been there it was called gideon  i cant eat i cant sleep  i see their faces  those werent cylons we attacked those were real people  they looked like my dad  they looked like my little brother  this isnt gonna change anything  at least the people on the gideon will have their justice  if thats what this is about then do it i will ill do it  somebody has to pay for what happened on that ship  i was in command i sent you there its my fault  come on son  do it  gideon was an accident this is a choice  colonel were all right here  lets go lieutenant    would you get out of my face  what made you do it kat  i was tired    havent gotten any sleep  i felt like i was losing my edge i dont know what else to do  couldnt you talk to someone  who am i gonna talk to were all in the same hole  okay there are no replacements coming up  theres no down time this is it  so i started taking stims  danna you made a mistake it happens  kat yeah except now my flights a pilot short  those guys theyre just as tired  and theyre just as messed up as i was but theyre still laying it on the line  ive worked my ass off defending this fleet  ive been frustrated ive been angry  ive been everything that you can possibly think of  but this is the first time that ive felt ashamed    ive seen enough  kill it  look i understand this might be hard for you to watch  its a hatchet job the fleet already thinks were  a bunch of triggerhappy assassins this just confirms it  you show us with our pants down and our asses hanging out  dont you have anything to say  i think its great  i think she did exactly what we asked her to do  she put a human face on the guardians of the fleet warts and all  im proud of it  you can show it to the entire fleet  doesnt get better than that  id like to see the end  so would l  go ahead yeah  danna i came to galactica to tell a story  in all honesty i thought i knew what that story was before i ever set foot there  how an arrogant military let their egos get in the way of doing their jobs  safeguarding the lives of the civilian population  but i found out that the truth was more complex than that  these people arent cylons  theyre not robots blindly following orders and polishing their boots  theyre people  deeply flawed yes but deeply human too  and maybe thats saying the same thing  what struck me most is that despite it all  the hardships the stress the everpresent danger of being killed  despite all that they never give up  they never lie down on the road and let the truck run them over  they wake up in the morning put on their uniforms and do their jobs  everyday no pay no rest  no hope of ever laying down the burden and letting someone else do the job  there are no relief troops coming  no colonial fleet training new recruits every day  the people on galactica are it  they are the thin line of blue that separates us from the cylons  lt gaeta told me a remarkable statistic  not a single member of galacticas crew has asked to resign not one  think about that  if you wore the uniform wouldnt you want to quit  to step aside and say enough let someone else protect the fleet   i know i would  but then i dont wear a uniform  most of us dont and most of us never will  the story of galactica isnt that people make bad decisions under pressure  its that those mistakes are the exception  most of the time the men and women  serving under cmdr adama get it right  the proof is that our fleet survives  and with galactica at our side we will endure  this is d anna biers fleet news service  that was shown across their entire fleet  their resilience is remarkable  play the footage that was cut  sharon what are you doing stop it cottle im trying to save your baby  guard this is a restricted area  sharon get off of me  im still alive shes still alive  i told you  thats incredible  and the baby  danna it was saved  we lost two raiders relaying the images back to the fleet  but i think the sacrifice was worth it  doral we must proceed with caution  the childs life must be protected at all costs  yeah  it truly is a miracle from god
