                previously on battlestar galactica  twentyfour ships jumped away  thats almost a third of the fleet  theyre gonna follow roslin to kobol to their death    cally shot sharon  there are many copies youll see her again  one of those things put two rounds into my fathers chest  we have found kobol  and when we retrieve the arrow we will open the tomb of athena  and we will find the road to earth  what i need to know  is exactly how to find the tomb of athena  i can show you the path  i dont know how long the path is or exactly where it leads to  but i can tell you that youre gonna have to move very very quickly      i want to see all recon material on kobol immediately in my quarters  kobol  im putting the fleet back together  im putting our family back together again  the scriptures say some of us will die on kobol  like a certain capt apollo    she could be anywhere  if we only use information contained within the book of pythia  which makes sense given the presidents identification with that particular gospel  then the tomb of athena is most likely located somewhere  in the mountains to the west of the city of the gods  lets assume she starts at the most easily recognized landmark  which is the opera house  theyd be setting down somewhere right here in this meadow  then heading west  are you okay yes i am    we got to get out of this ravine  i dont want us to get caught in a flash flood  raptor one went down  right about here just outside the ruins of the city  now we never made it past say here  but we visually scouted the approaches out to the mountains    thanks any time  if this is all shes got to go on  i dont know how the hell that woman thinks shes gonna find this tomb  well maybe shes seen it in a vision    im serious  she says she sees things  images prophecies whatever  the point is that she believes in them and so do the people that are with her  sir with all due respect that terrain is so rugged  i cant imagine navigating it without a map or a guide  okay  king of the hill queen of the hill thank you very much  we should take shelter until the storm passes  sounds good after that  then we start the tough part  lets go  the last rescue team reported no sign of a cylon baseship  or a raider anywhere near kobol  well set the jump arrival coordinates in the upper atmosphere  just in case  sir thats risky and its certainly not possible with a ship of this size  ill be going down in a raptor what  im not gonna leave the fleet undefended  and its too risky to try and take all of us  send a search party for fraks sake  and zeus warned the leaders of the 1 2 tribes  that any return to kobol would exact a price in blood  tyrol it certainly did for us  no more bloodshed enough loss  im only gonna take people who are absolutely necessary  dont try and argue with me saul  truth is  im the only one that can reach out to roslin  its always been between us anyway  we may have gone down separately but were gonna come back together  hopefully on our feet  but even in body bags were gonna be coming back together  im gonna contact the astral queen  see if they can pick us up until the weather clears  youre not in charge here tom all com traffic goes through me  try to remember that  how much longer do you want to wait tom  just keep your eyes on him  boomer  theres a formation of twin rocks up ahead  yeah i got it  i think those are the gates of hera you think  im putting together a lot of pieces from a lot of sources beyond your scriptures  if im right  thats the spot where your god supposedly stood  and watched athena throw herself down onto the rocks below  out of despair over the exodus of the 13 tribes  supposedly  i thought the cylons believed in the gods  yeah dont get her started  they believe in one true god or something like that  and we dont worship false idols  you were quick enough to come on this mission  lead us all to some tomb only actually mentioned in our false scriptures  we know more about your religion than you do  athenas tomb whoever  whatever she really was is probably up there  that part is true  madam president we wont make it up there before nightfall  lets go see how far we get  baltar this is a depressing place  a part of me is glad sharon never made it in here  you decided to brighten up the place a little did you  our child will be born here in this room  youre not listening oh you noticed  no i have had enough  do you seriously expect me to listen to you while you sit around stark naked  prattle on about this mythical baby of ours  mythical yes mythical  do you have any notion of how ridiculous youve become  the whole turn of our conversation is completely shot to pieces  im the father of a baby wholl be born to me from my fantasy woman  who i see solely in my head  my fantasy woman by the way who stopped being my fantasy  youre not my fantasy anymore  no sadly now youre nothing more than a common tease  i never said i would bear the child  wonderful more doubletalk more mind games  all right then who is it gonna be  whos going to bear our secret love child  its not starbuck is it  careful gaius youre in dangerous territory now  then i guess im really scared  so whats it going to be this week what is it  dont tell me ill guess  the ships gonna blow up  no damn  done that one so its gotta be someone else  someone me  but of course me im gonna explode god  god is gonna make me spontaneously combust into a great big ball of flame  and then the whole crew of galactica can celebrate on ambrosia  get really drunk    okay enough i cant do this anymore  youre right games over you win  i win  what did i win you dont get it  come on gaius wake up and smell the psychosis already  im sorry i dont know what youre talking about  okay look  theres no cylon chip implanted in your brain  im not real  youre not really getting secret messages from the cylons  youre just crazy    very funny  hysterical do you write your own material  you dont believe me do you no i dont    thats great i love it is it  good ive had enough of this all right  so can we just stop playing this stupid game  im sorry  but its the truth there is no chip  if there is no chip  then who  or what are you exactly  im you  im your subconscious frakking with your mind  okay check it out  you helped the cylons commit genocide against your own people  and your fragile little mind couldnt handle it so poof  i appear and start telling you how special you are  how god has chosen you yeah right  well i dont know what game youre playing anymore  but im not playing this stupid game sara now youve had your fun  why dont you get yourself checked out  go down to sickbay and get a brain scan that would settle it wouldnt it  go ahead i dare you  tyrol how simple could it be  okay were in the northnorthwest continent  quadrant c sector two which  oh for fraks sake let me see if i can make heads or tails of it  look i marked the terrain as best i could but were not  topographys for pansies anyways  howre you feeling diplomatic  i still dont think this is a very good idea commander  the last time she saw me she wasnt too happy with me  she trusts you values your counsel shell listen to you  i doubt that very much  im her assistant she doesnt put any more stock than what i say  she thinks youll be president one day    excuse me thats what she said to me once  that you reminded her of president adar when he ran for his first office  i dont really know how to respond to that sir  dont let it go to your head adar was a moron  racetrack this is an intraatmos entry  you guys buckled in yeah   perimeters clear no cylon presence  see nothing to worry about  having good luck already  gives me the creeps seeing him acting like that with her  he loves her and yeah he knows shes a machine  he doesnt care he loves her anyway  frak how can one of us get that roped in by one of them  we should keep an eye on him too  helos a friend of mine all right hes one of the good guys  yeah  sharon was a friend of yours too  feel like im back on caprica  no thanks im happy right here  really  yeah actually just being with you and kara feels like ive come home  its like im back in the fleet  but you were never in the fleet that was the other sharon  i know i know that  but i remember all of it  like getting my wings my first trip aboard the galactica  you know the memory of being in a uniform is so strong so potent  its like im sharon valerii and this is my family  thats pretty weird huh its okay  i like weird  zarak losing that priest really frakked her up  shes lost a lot of people  friends supporters  all she has left is her young prince  were here hes here  we know what we have to do  terrains rougher than we thought  dont know how far until we reach this tomb  why are you backing out of this now  im not backing out of anything  getting blood on your hands is a lot harder than washing it off  then let the cylon do it  what if the cylon were to get a weapon and shoot him herself  therell be a lot of confusion stress panic  then the cylon could find herself getting shot real easy  and how would you propose such a thing might happen  this has to happen tom you know that  not until we find the tomb  helo how much further farther  what  farther describes actual distance further is more figurative  youre a dictionary now  im sorry im smarter than you  thats okay the baby can have your brains as long as he gets my looks  yeah thatd be a real blessing for her  her  you know its a girl  yeah  starbuck so from what i could tell  the cylons have a plan for caprica  theyre cleaning up the bodies  bringing in the heavy machinery to fix the infrastructure  i understand  starbuck but they havent killed everyone  theres a resistance movement  once we find the tomb and get the map i think our first order of business  has to be planning a rescue mission back to caprica  lieutenant i hope you know how grateful i am for everything youve done  and what you risked  but right now i cant think about anything but finding that tomb  thank you  comfy cant talk  cant move then you  certainly wouldnt want me to do this  oh for i told you not to move  im so terribly sorry doctor it wont happen again  all right now i have to reset and start from the beginning  now hes got to reset and start all over again    why are you doing this to me  no 6 come on gaius even back when you werent nuts  there was always that little voice in your head  that little voice helping you through the rough times remember  im just the latest version of that little voice  i dont believe that for one moment  no god has a plan for me  gods plan    okay yeah god has a plan and  there is a god and he talks to gaius baltar  okay shut up will you  will you stop going crazy in there  im not crazy  once you find this tomb you know hes gonna have you killed right  hes not like that  hes a soldier youre the enemy nothings gonna change that  your twin your copy or whatever i know  the other sharon shot the old man  ive heard it about a thousand times  do you remember shooting him  it wasnt me  do you remember no  i see  what do you think happened to her i dont know  probably threw her in the brig or something  she was murdered by one of the crew  and everyone aboard galactica just let it happen  think im lying ask lee  theyre not gonna let your child be born  you think theyre gonna let you raise a potential enemy right in their midst  you want to get off this planet alive you better start looking out for yourself     starbuck  helo  put down your weapon captain  commander  its good to see you  madam president  billy  billy you have no idea  what it means to me to have you here  its good to see you too  oh my gods commander  shes with us commander  why  commander no  get off her  i want you to die  commander please dont we need her  commander you got to let her go  die    sir      dad  and you ask why        nothing nothing more nothing  are you satisfied  yes i am thank you very much doctor  just  were absolutely positive arent we that theres no  unidentified objects  you can obsess over these as much as you like on your own time  freaking hypochondriac one on every bloody ship  you interfered with a military mission and you broke your word to me  its the second part that really bothers you isnt it  laura i forgive you  thank you bill  i didnt ask for your forgiveness  you have it anyway  i cant believe the old man reacted like that  you know they killed the other sharon  what  in cold blood not even a trial  hi  hi  sharon  hello chief  you know who i am  yes  we havent met but  i remember you  its good to see you  so where does this leave us  back to where we started  under the yoke of president roslin and commander adama  not if we go back to the ship with a map to earth  and a sad story of how many people were killed down on kobol by the cylons  its over  let it go for now  lieutenant thrace says that there are survivors back on the colonies  there are people fighting against the cylons every day  theyre fighting for their homes their future  i see  doesnt give you pause  maybe your impulse the day the cylons attacked was right  maybe we shouldve stayed and fought for our homes  maybe the president of the colonies shouldve stayed with her people  i didnt come here for this  i didnt come here to navelgaze  or to catalog our mistakes  we made a decision to leave the colonies after the attack  we made that decision  it was the right one then its the right one now  so every moment of every day since then  is a gift  from the gods no  from you  for convincing me that i should go  i would be dead  my son would be dead  whatever else the costs  i wont secondguess that outcome    maybe its time to go find this  tomb of yours  so cally kills sharon  and the old man gives her  thirty days for murder  they dont see it as murder helo  thats what im trying to tell you  thats what youre not hearing  to him to the president to all of them  cylons arent people  im not a person to them  im a thing  i wont just stand by and let them kill you like the other sharon  okay  i believe you helo i do  but if were gonna have any future together  any at all  im gonna have to take matters into my own hands  whatre you talking about  do you love me yes  do you trust me  yes  then dont ask me what i have to do  sharon what the frak are you  trust me  trust us  have you had a chance to think about our conversation  havent thought about anything else and  when we get to the entrance theyll be distracted  ill take the father and you take the son  you should see this  lieutenant thrace i hope you have that arrow handy  i need you to know something  im sharon but im a different sharon i know who i am  i dont have hidden protocols or programs lying in wait to be activated  i make my own choices i make my own decisions  and i need you to know that this is my choice  this is one of the old stallions  its not military issue where the hell did you get this  its his      take it easy  just wanted  to see you get your due  you never did listen to me    stupid frakking thing couldnt come with a handbook  no because that would just be too logical wouldnt it  and the arrow of apollo will open the tomb of athena  yeah well unless anyone sees a keyhole or whatever  then were either in the wrong place or were just perfectly screwed  okay then why dont we just helo come here  on three one two three    there it is oh my god    after you  helo you stay out yes sir  chief  sir  guard everybody  yes sir  if the arrow didnt actually open the tomb  how do we know this is the right place  we dont  but its a tomb all right  the scriptures say you need the arrow to find the map  starbuck these broken statues i recognize them  the ram aerilon  gemenon the twins  these are the icons of the 12 tribes the 1 2 colonies  this is really where it all began  we all came from this place  this could be picon the fish  i guess this little lady could be virgon right  the goat caprica  sagittaron  the archer  hes missing something  where the hell are we  i dont know  tomb of athena i think  i thought we were already in the tomb  i think that was the lobby  again the ancient symbols  these patterns  were on the original flags of the 12 colonies  back in the days when the colonies were called by their ancient names  aries  taurus  gemini  cancer  leo  libra  virgo  the jewels match the constellations  this is the map  this is the map to earth  maybe  so is earth in one of these constellations  were standing on it  were standing on earth  the scriptures say  that when the 13th tribe landed on earth  they looked up into the heavens and they saw their 12 brothers  earth is the place  where you can look up in the sky  and see the constellations of the 12 colonies  i dont know what good its gonna do us though  then what are we supposed to do  search the entire galaxy for one particular star pattern  there there in scorpio ive seen that before  its the lagoon nebula  astro body m8  thats a long way from here  yeah  but at least now we have  a map and a direction    we have struggled since the attacks  trying to rely on one another  our strength and our only hope as a people  is to remain undivided  we havent always done all we could to ensure that  many people believe that the scriptures  the letters from the gods  will lead us to salvation  maybe they will  but the gods shall lift those who lift each other   and so to lift all of us  iet me present once again  the president of the colonies laura roslin  thank you    im okay  im okay really  yeah  its just  i dont want our baby born in this cell  their child  i told you a child would arrive  told you it would be born right here in this room  how could you ever doubt me  boomer is going to bear  our child  an honor for which she is hardly deserving  but one doesnt question gods will  well youre not a chip  that weve established  yes  sharon being pregnant does suggest  that you are rather more than a simple manifestation of my subconscious  im not  crazy no  and who  or what  are you  exactly  im an angel of god sent here to protect you  to guide you to love you  to what end  to the end of the human race
