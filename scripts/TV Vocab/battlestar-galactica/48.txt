                previously on battlestar galactica  congratulations on making captain  sorry i wasnt there  thank you sir  hows your mother  getting married  in the mountains north of here theres this little stream  the water is so clear its like looking through glass  i am thinking of building a cabin   you and cally have a fight  you didnt hear us  i figured we should have sold tickets  to marriage  why we build bars  its not too late for baltar to just disappear  we cant do that  for all his crimes hes one of us  so what happens next  we give him his trial   colonel tight to see you admiral  enter  youre up early  couldnt sleep so i thought id make myself useful  happy anniversary bill  its okay  its okay  i dont know here just doublecheck it for me  daddys getting good at this  daddys tired of burning his wrists  im gonna get ready we got morning watch  i thought were spending the day with nicky  yeah so did i until laskin and perry called in sick  its okay  so  you volunteered us in their place we barely get any time off as it is  cally you know the deck is shorthanded  the deck has been shorthanded since we got here  all i know is frakking daycare workers see more of nicky than we do  yeah well until the daycare workers figure out  how to strip a viper this is the way its gonna be  hey buddy come here  oh oh oh i know i know i know you just laid down too didnt you  come here i got you  there you go  ill take him to daycare  come on buddy come on  hey  forgetting something  whats on duty schedule  nothing sexy a co2 scrubbers out near sick bay  broken water line in the galley oh  now that most of our vipers are out of drydock  chiefs gonna have a look at the servos in airlock 12  would you please  is that it  the fleets quiet  you could use some time for yourself i can handle first watch  ill be keeping my schedule  this is just another day  just another day  maybe i should have married him instead of you  i could have sold tickets to that  we had some good times  but more bad  but you keep bringing me back anyway  just this one day  year after year  only thing i cant understand is  why  either do i  excuse me sir  put it on the table private  jaffee sir  would there be anything else admiral  thatll be all jaffee  its going to be a long day  it always is  morning chief   is nicky okay  yeah hes fine  first time he didnt cry when i dropped him off at day care  so figurski you gonna at least pretend to do something today  frakkin scrubber  it takes adama two seconds to sign off on an order  thats gonna take us all day to finish  itll take you all day anyhow  seelix cally youre with me airlock 12   seelix can you get the door  yep  this place is a frakking mess  yeah the cylons blew the hell out of it  nobodys been down here since damage control plugged the holes   seelix can you hear me in there  yeah  do you want to see if you can find the electrical diagrams of the airlock  okay  ew i did find somebodys yearold lunch  he didnt even cry  cal i told you nicky is fine  yeah and anybody could have dragged a tool bag down here   it didnt have to be me  yeah well it had to be somebody  you know these gearing systems better than anybody  what can i do give you special treatment because youre my wife   how would that look  i dont care  we keep trying to pretend like nothings changed  that our lives are exactly like they were before we went to new caprica  but it is different  were married  we have a son  yeah its just a little rough patch  what if rough patches are all we have left  we swore we were gonna raise nicky ourselves remember  yeah well we swore a lot of things  the cylons didnt exactly cooperate did they  give me those wire cutters  what the hell  oh for frak sakes  seelix what are you doing open the door  i didnt do anything  chief im picking up a pressure differential in there  but nothing drastic  but you guys are definitely losing air  well it doesnt take much  once the airflow sensors detect  a big enough leak all the inner doors are designed  to drop automatically its just a safety precaution   i feel safer already  wait a second  are you saying that the hulls been breached  well breach is a bit dramatic  but the airs going somewhere  one of these patches must have cracked when we came in  soon as we plug it and restore the pressure  door should open  then we can pull the work orders on  whoever made these frakkin welds and kick their asses  the most important thing is to keep breathing so  lets just find the leak  this is it right here this one  leeson takes first watch  kinsey checks the roster  jaffee brings me coffee  jaffee brings me coffee  are you still doing that  the memory exercises  do you really think they expect you to know all of their names  you never change do you  one of the joys of being long dead  i suppose  now hurry youre going to be late meeting laura  maybe shes got a thing for bad boys  she wouldnt be the first  shes the president of the twelve colonies  im sorry im sorry of course  since youve created one godlike facade for yourself  why not invent another one for her  its another excuse to keep your distance  admiral  madame president   how are you  very good  im sorry im sure this all could have been done over the wireless  but frankly i was going a little stir crazy on colonial one i had to get out  deep space pilots used to call it o b e   whats o b e  overcome by events  and youre always welcome here  you know that  well you may not feel that way after you finish this tory drew up an agenda  baltar again  cant we just give him back to the cylons  you know how much i love that idea unfortunately  given what little i was able to glean from the caprica six  i dont think the cylons would take him back so were stuck  fine  then try the son of a bitch and be done with it  we have to give him a trial but under what law  caprican picon tauron  do we give him a jury trial do we set up a tribunal  we dont even have anything closely resembling a comprehensive law library  and this fleet is not exactly brimming with legal talent  you bring lawyers into this  theyre gonna drag you around for months  wasnt your father  an attorney on caprica  yes and i told you that i didnt get along with him very well  all right okay  i am ready to set up an organizing committee  but frankly  trying to get a room full of legal scholars to stay on task  is like herding cats and so  i need to set up a chairman of this committee  somebody who can make a hard decision  and who wont get seduced and bogged down by all the legalese   you have a candidate  as a matter of fact i do  i was thinking lee  like grandfather like grandson perhaps what do you think  im not gonna say is incapable of handling it but  hes never shown any type of interest in law  i know but heres the thing  we can use the lawyers to parse the law but  we really need people who actually know the difference between right and wrong  thats lee   ill talk to him  good  also admiral  i was wondering if youd mind if i  stayed on your ship for the rest of the day  please by all means  this is very difficult for me to say but  im going to go to the gym  prepare yourself  on its best day it smells like the inside of a shoe  see if theres another patch in there i want to double up  on this one make sure it holds  come on faster is better the sooner we do this   the sooner we get out  i heard you the first time  youre getting better at ignoring all of that  that sudden hush  those sidelong glances  i really used to get to you  i dont ever recall being able to intimidate you  thats right  but i knew you long before you were the admiral  back when you were just bill  the husband who wasnt there  the father who left  just bill  who is bill adama anyway still a good question  i wonder if ill get an answer   maybe we finally scared the toasters off  oh yeah narcho your crap flyings putting the fear of the gods in them  whats up buddy  whats the matter with you  sorry ive got the weirdest rash  really  hope she was worth it buddy  tenhut  at ease  before we get started i want a show of hands  how many of you boneheads know how to count  cause i keep hearing numbers being thrown around the hangar deck   and then 48 now 49 days since our last enemy contact  now i realize that any higher maths probably beyond most of you  so im gonna make this real simple for you  one  is the only number you need to remember  because all it takes is for one pilot to let his guard down  one eco to miss a dradis contact  and suddenly the cylons are on top of us  thats when people die  hes like both of us  proud stubborn and angry  but hes coming into his own  especially in the last few months  dont tell me   tell him  he knows  knows what  that the admirals going to give him a good performance review  or that his father loves him  dont tell me the admirals facade extends to lee too  formation flying  deflection shooting tactics  doing touch and goes until every last one of you hits an okay three  red and blue sections will go first  yellow and green will follow  skids up in ten minutes dismissed  starbuck if youve got a problem i dont want to hear about it  my only problem is that you didnt preach that sermon a week ago  you might want to find some new material though  the old mans been using that one fatal mistake line since we got here  well if youre gonna steal  steal from the best  sir  pretty tough on them today  well a kick in the butt is worth a thousand words  gods know you kicked mine enough  everything okay  yeah its been one of those mornings  president wants to take the fast track on baltars trial  shes looking for someone to take charge of the preliminaries  help cobble together the legal framework  she wants me to assign you  youre kidding  interested  more surprised  did she say why she asked for me  well shes gonna need someone she can trust  you definitely fit that  i remember when you were younger  youd go visit your grandfathers house  and you were fascinated with his papers and his law books  and there was me thinking i was being sly  sneaking off into his office all by myself  yeah i guess its a pipe dream now  but for five minutes there i really did consider lawyer  as one of a dozen careers that i could  go into before i joined the service  i never knew that  well it was probably during one of my  angry at dad phases  anyway its impossible  even if i wanted to help out theres no way  the cags duty is already 247 even on a light week  yeah i assumed that  major were ready for you  excuse me  okay well ones gonna have to do  seelix check the pressure if that patch holds  were gonna equalize in a few minutes this doors gonna open   for frak sakes  oh my gods   how they doing  still alive  this is a condition three alert hull breach on deck 14  chief  admiral  i seemed to have turned this into a fullblown fubar  youd be doing us a hell of favor to get those doors open  we gotta get them out of there  keep moving keep moving  the airlocks designed to lock down if the pressure decreases unexpectedly   as soon as  i know the system  we have redundancies we have backups  the manual override is down  there is no way of getting those inner doors to open  the thing mustve taken heavy damage on the way out of new caprica  the whole ships taken a pounding we need six weeks in drydock  just to hammer out the dings let alone tackle the structural damage   how much time do they have  with a leak that size  theyll be out of air in half an hour maybe less  those are blast doors  it would take at least an hour to cut through them  why dont we put explosives in the observation booth  blow the glass pull them out  no the glass is strong enough to withstand a tylium explosion  anything strong enough to take out the glass  will take out tyrol and cally at the same time  i need a rescue plan  not excuses  seven seconds  and another ten to repressurize since well doing this in open space  thats pushing it  this might be a stupid question but  has anyone ever tried a rescue like this before  no ones ever been crazy enough  doesnt matter were out of time prep for launch   weve only got 18 minutes left  all right lets go were on  galen  airlocks still jammed chief  overrides are not responding  guess were kind of running out of options  im gonna take you out through the front door  youll put a ship out there and rig up some kind of docking collar  youll be out of air in a few minutes  theres no time for a collar  sir if youre talking about an eva we dont have pressure suits  we dont have a choice  athenas gonna position her raptor in front of the airlock hatch open  were gonna blow the bolts right off of that door and when it opens up  youre gonna have to jump for it  now listen to me both of you  you can do this  people have been able to live up to a minute  in exposure without a suit  admiral i dont know  well talk later  get ready  athena galactica you have priority clearance  all other traffic is being waved away  wait   what about nicky  admirals right  we have to prep  we gotta move everything away from here to the door  galen  we both know what happens to kids in the fleet when their parents arent there  apollo and dee  theyll take care of him  no  no pilots  hes not going through this twice  sir  theres a civilian family  the mothers name is susan deckler  she has a little girl  if anything happens to us  ill see to it  i was being selfish  i wanted you with me  like old times  i didnt think about nick  im sorry  admirals gonna get us out of here okay  youre gonna take care of nicky  more than a few seconds out there  were talking severe exposure  decompression sickness at the very least hypothermia  they could freeze to death  make sure cottles got his hyperbaric chamber ready  im sorry  galactica apollo bringing raptor into position  abeam lock 12  put your mask on  all right listen up  we dont have time to hang back until the airlock doors blow  so were liable to experience some turbulence from the residual oxygen  maybe even some shrapnel hits athena  youre gonna have to be ready to compensate  im on it major  well hold position until chief and cally are secured  lets just get this done  galactica apollo raptor door is open  were standing by   ready to execute  chief cally  raptors in position we gotta go now  get ready to blow the hatch on my mark  okay  no matter what youll hold on to me  dont let go  okay  three  two  one  do it  wow watch out bank right bank right  im in position   pull up your nose pull up  got it  hold it right there  galactica apollo  raptor secured and pressurized theyre in rough shape  we gotta get em to sickbay right away  come in  so any word on chief and cally  theyre alive but doc cottles still evaluating their condition  so are you gonna tell me whats going on with you  its this day  my gods your wedding anniversary  i had totally forgotten  probably seems foolish  especially the way that it all ended up but  still  it still means something to me  weve never talked about it  the divorce  your mother  it was a bad time for all of us  your mother gave you  and your brother a home  stability  dad i know you want to believe that but  you know what forget it  it was a long time ago  you have something to say son just say it  well dad we had four walls  but stability  my gods you knew what mom was like  i mean the mood swings   its why you left her  we had problems but  she cared deeply for you and your brother  things changed after you left  i mean there were times when she lost control  dont listen to him bill  and she would try and apologize  she would promise that she would make things better  but then she would just start drinking  and all of her good intentions would just go flying out the frakkin window  is it true  i cant believe youd even ask me that  damn it  is it true  and then one day finally the apologies even stopped  thats enough  you walked out on me  you walked out on me  the brilliant commander  who could lead all of his men into combat  but he couldnt find a way to live with his own family  we never lived anywhere for more than six months  just following you around from one base to another  waiting for you to come home  but you werent here for any of us  it was always whatever was easiest for the great adama  they needed you  they were our children  they needed a father  all through your glorious career  you have prided yourself on being a leader of men  judging people  always making the hard call  but when it came to the biggest decision of your life  bill you blew it  we were wrong for each other from day one  but you just couldnt accept that  thats it thats why you keep calling me back  because if you had made  that mistake  it would just call into question  all of your other decisions  she was still your mother lee  i loved her  i believe you  i just dont think she ever loved you  hes right over here  i dropped by daycare  somebody wanted to see you   whos that  hey little man  hows she doing  doc cottle says shes gonna be okay  but its gonna be a while before shes 100  careful  yeah  yeah im fine  i know  come here  i got you  come to daddy  little man  you want to go see mommy go see mommy  lets go see mommy come on  shes over here yeah  cal  cal  sweetie  look whos here  look whos here  seelix  no matter what i dont know how  we will manage to find   find a balance you and me  we will take care of nick  okay  i love you  look this is mommys hand  there  how are you  good   so whats this  it was here when i got in  its from your father  is it ticking  he left you a note  caprican criminal codes  these are my grandfathers law books  your dad mustve had these in storage all this time  whys he giving them to you now  for that day when we all have the time  im glad you stopped by i have something for you  this was given to me by one of the colonists down on new caprica  and i forget about it and tory found it in a pile of old clothes  blood runs at midnight  dont let the title fool you its pretty good mystery  i think youll like it  and its not a loane its a gift  you ever think about the times much on new caprica  i try to think about the good times yes i do  one in particular  stands out in my mind  you were wearing your really bright red dress  said you wanted to build a cabin  it was baltars ground breaking ceremony  i got a little silly that night  you ever wonder what wouldve happened if the cylons hadnt have come back  i think given baltar and the terrain we couldnt have made a go of it  what about you do you think you wouldve stayed on galactica  or do you think you wouldve settled  its pretty hypothetical isnt it  it is until it isnt  did i just say that  its worth just seeing you laugh like that  weve been at war so long sometimes we forget what were fighting for  raise our kids in peace  enjoy one anothers company  live life as people again  like that night on new caprica thats really what we  are talking about here now isnt it  that and   other times  so if the cylons hadnt come back  but they did  we have certain responsibilities  yes we do sir and  i will be back in a few days and if youd like we can   talk more about that night  bill  the answers yes  i absolutely wouldve built the cabin  go ahead  put it away like you have after every anniversary  promise me you wont take it out again  itd be easier to hate you  but that would be a lie carolanne  and theres been enough of that through our lives  we had something didnt we  yeah  we had something  see you next year   thanks for watching bsg with our subs
