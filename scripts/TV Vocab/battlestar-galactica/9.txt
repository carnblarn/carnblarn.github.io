                narrator previously on battlestar galactica    i notice youre calling her sharon now  no 6 she acts like them thinks like them  no 6 shes one of them doral but shes one of us  boomer we gotta go now we gotta travel fast even faster than before  roslin they found him in the storage compartment  hes another copy of the cylon you know as leoben  ill send a team over to destroy it anything it says cannot be trusted   dont  adama is a cylon    commander heres dr baltars report  and the president is waiting for you up in the core  thank you  adama clear the deck  adama madame president we are the proud owners  of the universes first bonafide cylon detector  that is great news  yeah  so when do we begin  dr baltar would like to start widespread testing as soon as possible  but there are some serious limitations  he can only do one person at a time and verification takes hours  so whos going to go first    the tests right  i think people in sensitive positions should go first  i completely agree how about you  excuse me  if youre a cylon id like to know  if im a cylon youre really screwed    seriously i do think that you should go first  show everyone in the fleet that they can trust the people at the top  then maybe you should go first  all right ill go first  i think thats good i do  pilot bank on my advice   they always do that  no theyre just showing off  they know im in here  you date a special assistant to the president word gets out  so this is officially a date    jurys still out  man  observation deck has two minutes remaining  dualla you could pull rank  you could tell them youre on special business for the president of the colonies  your boss pulls more weight around here than mine   you can tell them adama wants you to  yeah what wants me to what  i lost my train of thought    how is he these days by the way   the old man hes fine i guess  you guess  hes been acting kind of funny lately seems distracted or something  hes been making all these weird calls from his quarters super secret   probably a security thing  they dont want me to log the calls though  no trace file nothing   and this just started  a few days ago  billy keikeya are you pumping me for information about the old man  deckhand times up   no of course not  you are   you are youre a spy thats what you are  i was just asking a couple of questions  i hope you liked the answers  because theyre the last ones youre gonna get for a while  roslin what did you find out  dualla couldnt put her finger on it  but yeah she said hes been acting differently  i could see that myself he was distracted and unfocused what else  some scrambled wireless calls he didnt want logged  she didnt know who he called or why but none of this is damning evidence  billy the calls could be securityrelated  and his odd behaviour could be stress pure and simple   exhaustion paranoia  all right it could be any of those things  roslin but what if its not  madame president with all due respect  i cannot believe were actually entertaining the idea  that commander adama  has been somehow replaced by a cylon duplicate  oh my gods billy  i hope youre right    is suicide really a sin  no 6 a mortal one im afraid but its not that bad is it gaius      baltar eleven hours to test each one for cylon indicators  no 6 thatll take awhile   no 6 601534 years  now lets figure in a few hours to sleep here and there  baltar well call it an even 61 shall we no 6 sure  i prefer to kill myself    commander adama are you a cylon  baltar tune in tomorrow  no 6 its hard being a genius baltar yes  no 6 there should be some perks baltar yes                starbuck whats up doc    lt thrace good to see you i was just  keeping up with the old exercises    that should do me for today    baltar i feel all better  baltar what brings you to the lab at this time of the night  starbuck its midafternoon baltar yeah it is  crazy workload i totally lose track of time  so what can i do for you  you can zip up your fly   so  my blood test  no 6 youre right about one thing gaius  there is something very intriguing about her  very good very good  at least i did that much      dradis contact   cylon raider bearing 738 carom 005  galactica apollo   action stations  cylon raider bearing 738 carom 005   relative zero  close with enemy destroy acknowledge  apollo were on it galactica

weapon systems  he jumped  he jumped away before we could zero him out  damn it probably giving away our position to every cylon base ship right now  where in the hell is the old man  order the fleet to execute emergency jump procedures  everyone rendezvous at the standby coordinates  contact  single raider bearing 881 carom 247  apollo galactica cylon raider detected at 881 carom 24  apollo wait i see him same raider tigh what  its the same raider i can see the damage from before  its behaving erratically  he jumped away again  contact single raider same telltales     its like hes just flying around in circles  wounded bird cant fly home  apollo galactica we got him on dradis but hes pretty far out there  take us three minutes to close to weapons range  no this is our perfect chance to get some intel  order apollo to close with the raider but do not engage  put a raptor in the air  as long as thats flopping around out there  tell them i want to suck in every electronic signal it makes  sir colonel commander adamas raptor is requesting permission  dualla to enter the landing pattern tigh permission granted  tigh stand down to condition two dualla permission granted  tigh mr gaeta you

centurions away before theyve never sent an entire army after me  boomer theyre after me helo why you  while they were holding me i overheard some things  helo what boomer plans deployments  theres a big cylon base at delphi a major hub  helo delphi frakking bastards  the best place to try and grab a ship and get off this frakking planet      dr gaius baltar department of cylon detection  how may i direct your call  roslin youre in a good mood baltar madame president    im sorry i was expecting someone else we havent spoken in ages  doctor id like you to call me the moment commander adamas test is complete  will you do that  commander adama cancelled his test a short time ago   why  i dont know  he gave me another sample he said it had priority   whose  ill just check  some woman called ellen no surname he dropped it off and left  is there a problem  dr baltar i would like you to resume testing  commander adamas blood sample immediately thank you   i cant believe youre alive  i cant believe it myself    saul i dont remember the last few weeks  ellen its weeks right tigh right  youve been on the rising star all this time  ellen i guess so  the last thing i remember is being on picon  i was at the airport buying a ticket home  and hearing something about the cylons  and then just dreams mostly dreams  until a couple days ago  ellen they tell me i was knocked out when the cylons attacked the airport  and someone just picked me up  and put me on the last flight out  some saviour i dont even know who  its all right youre here now  starbuck its like we found a treasure chest  one of the major issues weve been having  with the raider we captured is to figure the fasterthanlight drive  this wounded bird is jumping all over the place out there  yeah and every time it jumps it gives us more data that we can use  but what was it doing out there and how long can it keep it up  the moment you have your ftl data give me an update  lets not let this thing linger out there longer than we have to  tyrol yes sir   you wanted to see me sir  stay on it  you have dinner plans   what  come on  ellen i never thought id see you again tigh me neither  the things i said before the things i did  in the past its all in the past   start over  start over       i i cant  forget it  i cant im on duty    xo now  understood all right tell her im on my way  girlfriend   official business  feels like old times   id explain but  its classified  ill be back as soon as i can  ill be here waiting  as soon as i can  you want to be very very careful with what you just said  youre talking about a man i owe my life to many times over  i know these are uncertain times  and this has been a difficult transition for you  excuse me colonel  i do appreciate how difficult this is for you to hear believe me  but i would advise you right now not to say anything that you will regret  i need to know if you have seen anything suspicious   about his recent behaviour  no  what about the fact that he left the galactica  without telling anyone where he was going or when he would return  and at that very moment a cylon raider jumped into view   and started acting strangely  i know exactly where he was  roslin you do tigh he was picking up my wife  your wife  turns out shes been unconscious aboard the rising star ever since the attack  roslin oh my gods  roslin thats fantastic thats amazing tigh yes it is  when ellen stepped off that shuttle i thought i was going to pass out  ellen   your wifes name is ellen  yes it is  ellen ellen tigh  id very much like to meet your wife colonel  resume the test on ellen  no its no trouble at all  tigh ellen   did you shut the door  i already did     surprise  ambrosia where did you get this   i have my ways  ellen i thought it might be just the thing for a little celebration     we need to talk  first things first  there   starting over  starting over   im technically still on duty  i think they can do without you for a day  tigh it doesnt really work that way    starting over          sure theres whining and complaining like you would expect  but the people i talked to are mostly hopeful and optimistic  thats good to hear  there are a few people who still might wonder  if a kindergarten teacher is really the right person to be president  but theyre just a tiny minority  wonderful  everyone is so truly grateful to all of you on galactica   you literally are our saviours  were just doing our jobs  you are so modest    hes always been that way    lee could i trouble you for a little more of this lovely ambrosia   sure  thank you dear  bill you must be so proud of your sons  lee here has grown into such a handsome man  i can only imagine what zak must look like now  you are the spitting image of your mother  and i bet zak takes just after his daddy  adama zak passed away a couple of years ago  im sorry how tragic the death of a child  theres been so much death so much pain  sometimes its completely overwhelming  im sure he was a beautiful boy    the captain of the rising star was puzzled as to how you got on his ship  i know i know some thoughtful soul just rescued me  from almost certain death and put me on the last flight out of picon   how lucky for us all  yes indeed  the strange thing is no one can recall  giving you any medical assistance until about a week ago  i know  its a miracle im alive    apollo i think i better clear some of these dishes   you are so sweet  very good my compliments to the chef  so bill now the question on everyones mind  and i do mean everyone  apollo sorry ellen its okay  is where is earth and when do we get there   thats classified information  that word again  leave the man alone  ellen come on if there are no privileges of being an xos wife  then whats the point  bill were all family here come on  the need for secrecy is paramount ellen  im sorry perhaps you dont know that the cylons look like us now  that yes i knew that  its recent news most people found out a few days ago  a thing like that would travel fast right  any one of us could be a cylon    boo    did you see the looks on their faces   you are too easy  thank you so much for coming  its been a wonderful evening  tigh thought it would never end  i seemed to have lost one of my shoes   i think its right here  thank you  apollo here we are   you look very very happy  thats because i am very happy  thank you     it was nice to see you again  the pleasures all mine   hope to see you soon  im sure you will    hang on  watch your step   good night  lovely dinner  tigh ive got her adama be careful  you actually think that woman is a cylon  if shes not then were all in a lot of trouble  ellen when did bill become such a stickinthemud  the mans a carving  hes one of those faces on a totem pole  she slept with more than half the fleet while saul was in space  why the hell did he stay married to her   its obvious he loves her deeply  blindly  ellen used to encourage the worst instincts in this guy   bring out this selfdestructive streak in him  used to  helo sharon stop i cant keep up      boomer helo come on  you can do it please  you have to get up    boomer there right there    boomer turn your light off  we gotta find another way out of here were going  why arent you waiting you keep going and going   you never get tired  its adrenaline  im not gonna die here and im not gonna let you die here either  boomer okay lets go  tigh dont worry ill get us home ellen yeah right   just like bills getting us to earth  dont start on bill    he doesnt have the slightest idea where earth is  you dont have to yell it through the halls  bill adama doesnt know where earth is   colonel  doctor  baltar actually i dont believe ive had the pleasure   im dr gaius  baltar i know exactly who you are  and the pleasures all mine  something here isnt there  ellen youre still holding my hand baltar thats funny  i thought you were still holding onto mine  im watching you both of you  no 6 and you should be watching her  care to join us for a nightcap doctor  id love to  gaeta  dr baltar report to the lab the commander is waiting   but i cant another time perhaps  count on it  tata   oh saulie are you jealous  you said we were starting over  we are sweetheart we are that was just a little harmless flirting  ellen you should know something tigh what  in the middle of dinner   bill put his hand on my leg  ellen im not falling for this  did you know he came to see me on the rising star  what  hed come into my room id pretend to be asleep  then hed sit by the side of my bed   and then hed touch me  why are you doing this youre lying  i am not he was on that ship  ill prove it  come on  look its not magic its science  if you want the right result you have to wait awhile  i gave you her sample this morning  i have started and stopped the test twice already now  so im running a little behind   twice  my fault long story  your fault   i shouldnt have mentioned that  you shouldnt have   did you tell him to stop ellens test  yes i did   why  i had some concerns  about what  in all honesty i think its fair to say that your behaviour recently has been odd  my behaviour what do you think im a cylon me  you cant deny that youve been making these  offlog calls these mysterious trips off the ship  where did you hear that  have you been spying on me on my own ship  ladies and gentlemen please were in a laboratory  there are hazardous chemical compounds everywhere  thats a thermonuclear bomb for fraks sakes  what do you mean unlogged mysterious trips whats going on  i had to go to the rising star and i didnt want tigh to know  why not  because whether or not his wife is a cylon shes trouble  and i wanted to keep her away as long as i could  then why did you bring her aboard the ship  because shes his wife and i couldnt refuse her access  to her own husband without causing suspicion  besides i wanted her close to me  i told you i told you he wanted me   lovely  what the hells going on  you have been secretly visiting my wife  no yes but its complicated   i told you hes been after me for years  what  now boys boys dont fight over little old me   ellen be quiet  you dont tell me what to do  apollo we should all take a deep breath roslin i will  i was afraid that she might be a cylon i brought her blood here to test it  tigh thats why you cancelled your test adama howd you know that  tigh you didnt tell me he was testing my wife   you met with the president  yes she thought you might be a cylon  i know  gaeta attention pass the word for the commander xo and the cag  commander adama col tigh and captain adama please report to cic  adama mr gaeta  the raider smoothed out its flight path about two minutes ago  it seems to be under control   yeah but hes not jumping for home  no sir he isnt  has our reconnaissance detected any outgoing communications  since he straightened out his flight pattern  yes sir but its likely its just another distress signal  launch the alert fighters  this is the cag launch the alert fighters  sir i hate to tell you this but i think its been playing with us the entire time  it was waiting to see how wed react   playing with us  yeah   order the flight leader to destroy the target  yes sir  galactica hot dog the raider just took off  he doesnt look injured to me hes heading back to the fleet   theyre not going to catch him  action stations set condition one   this is not a drill  he doesnt have any weapons  hes on a suicide run     did you launch the alert fighters  it was the xos call   i had a hunch  good call   one question  because i was worried   that she might be a cylon  and if she wasnt  i know how you feel about her saul shes been a negative force in your life  im sorry but its the truth  maybe she was everything was different then  she was different i was different  ive grown accustomed to seeing you without the cup in your hand  so i had a couple of drinks tonight   i was celebrating i think i deserved to  yes you did  launching those fighters on a hunch  you saved our ship  tigh just doing my job adama you do your job good  thats why i need you saul that and that were friends  i dont want anything to come between that not even ellen  it wont    doral weve searched every street every building  they slipped through hows that possible  she thinks she loves him now that she cant live without him  her passion is making her more resourceful   bothers you doesnt it  well get them in the end  no it bothers you that youve never experienced it    you saw the way helo was when we took her away  he was pathetic  i cant help wondering what it would be like to feel that intensely  even in his anguish he seemed so alive    green green everyone  mrs tigh is definitely human   no hard feelings i hope ellen  i completely understand  but lets be sure and test you next   doctor  my pleasure my job  you dont want to frak with me bill try to remember that  dont frak with me either ellen  if only they knew that everyone passes these days  why its so much simpler that way  no muss no fuss  what did her test really say  ill never tell
