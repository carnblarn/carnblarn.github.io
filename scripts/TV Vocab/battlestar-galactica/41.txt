                previously on battlestar galactica  you can not play god and wash your hands of the things that youve created  sooner or later the day comes  when you cant hide from the things that youve done anymore  attention to all colonial units  cylon attack underway   this is no drill  ill be right there  how why  it doesnt really matter now  what does matter is that as of this moment  we are at war  youre full of bile hatred  poison  and im sorry for what happened to you down there  but i gotta run a ship  the last thing i need  is a oneeyed drunk sowing discontent and disobedience  so you can get your ass back into your quarters and not leave  until youre ready to act like the man that ive known for the past 30 years  that man doesnt exist anymore bill  and you wont be seeing me again  is there really any place left in the universe  deserving of such a rare and distinguished item  i was thinking put it in the bathroom right over the toilet  excellent choice  oh my gods  tory come look at this this is the dossier  that billy prepared for me my first day aboard galactica  i cant believe i was about to throw this out in the trash  the valkyrie  this was adamas command before galactica  look at that this year marks admiral adamas   in fact his commissioning dates only a few days from now  here  i think i want to have a ceremony  lets give the admiral a medal  for 45 years of devoted service  couldnt have come at a better time  give the people something to feel good about for a change  this is the xo set condition one throughout the ship i repeat  set condition one throughout the ship this is not a drill   whats the problem  three raiders  cbdr bearing 145 carom 33  but this isnt their standard wedge formation  wheres the cap  starbuck and kat will intercept in 98 seconds sir  it looks like a pursuit with weapons exchange between them   a pursuit  yes sir  weve got two raiders chasing a third   have they fired on any of ours yet  no sir  what the hell are they doing  lets see if we can climb up their asses without drawing any fire  these two seem preoccupied with the other one  got any idea why cylons would be chasing cylons  dont know dont care  but waitll we close the gap  i wont chase these things any longer than i have to  yeah roger that   two down one to go  kat check six  damn kat flank right this guys headed right for galactica  im on it starbuck  krypter krypter krypter  this is bulldog  get me the hell out of here im wounded   what the frak is that  target in range closing in  krypter krypter krypter this is bulldog   audio lockon  where is that coming from  its the raider sir   take the frakkin shot kat  gimme a sec almost got him lined up  krypter krypter krypter  this is bulldog  kat take the frakkin shot  order the vipers hold their fire immediately  have them escort the raider in  prisoner drill  i want the alert guard in the hangar deck in five minutes  yes sir  all right park that bird lets grab this raider lets go move  make some room for the marines  is it really you sir  yeah  its me  welcome home bulldog   we may never have this opportunity again  im assuming you appreciate the consequences  if youre discovered  and you understand commander  that this conversation did not happen  are you prepared for this  of course sir  on one condition  i need my men  especially for the stealth ship theres only one pilot i trust  who  well  the conspiracy theorists are gonna be disappointed  weve checked your  dna signature against your military records and its conclusive  youre not a cylon  smoke  thats right  hes one of mine  disappeared about three years ago we think that he was captured  id like to meet him  of course ill arrange it  he checks out fine  whatever they did to him out there they  kept him fed and relatively healthy  physically anyway  i know youve been through a lot  i realize that  but youve gotta talk to me danny  how the hell did you escape  off a cylon baseship  well sir  its like this  the enemy had me locked in a cell for three years  the accommodations were lousy  the service was slow  and after a while i felt the institution no longer had anything to offer me  so i left  you had me worried there for a moment  thought maybe the cylons had beaten the attitude out of you  howd you get out  i thought i was gonna die in there bill  but a while ago they all started getting sick  i mean  really sick  you mean a virus  yeah  weve seen that too  i heard them say it was spreading getting worse   but eventually i realize   im not catching it  im immune  so what did you do  i was smart   patient  i waited  well   youre lookin good  strong  me ive felt better  i dont know why you guys do all that exercise  what are you trying to stave off getting old  doesnt seem such a tragedy to me  given the alternatives  you know what im saying  do i look that bad  you know what i think  i think youre afraid  let me try understanding exactly what happened to you  im just gonna go back a little  all right  about a year prior to the cylon attack on the colonies  you were on a mission with admiral adama is that correct  it was a black ops mission  you remember the tauron colonists were such outlaws  always  pushing their luck with the admiralty every chance they got  right  the taurons were drilling for   tylium ore  on a moon that was too close to the cylon armistice line  we knew that they had to get out of there   or risk provoking the cylons  im sorry but how did this result in his ship being shot down  he was my recon pilot  he was there to gather evidence  the taurons mustve seen us coming because they ambushed him  lieutenant novacek was shot down  by the taurons in cold blood  krypter krypter krypter ive got damage to the port engine  bird is down repeat   bird is down request rescue   stealthstar transmission wire  this is bulldog   bird is down repeat   bird is down request rescue  so what did you do  i made a bad call  his ship was gone  no ejection on dradis  no distress call  he was dead  so i left  but the lieutenant did eject obviously and somehow survived  in his ejection seat long enough  for the cylons to find him  could you both give us a moment please thank you tory  and thank you very much lieutenant   i appreciate it  madam president  why dont we check the  fleet registry see if any of your family might have survived  so are you gonna tell me what really happened  youre gonna have to trust me on this one okay  its my miss  ill fix it  this is the last one here  fire  i see it  i see it  i see it  i see it  daniel novacek  just escaped from a pow cell on a cylon baseship  stole a raider flew it here  i just finished debriefing him  bulldogs alive  yeah  my gods  how could he be alive  that tough son of a bitch he actually made it didnt he  yeah i guess he did  so are you here to talk to your friend or to your xo  and last time i checked i was neither  i get it  yeah this is gonna be a little complicated  for you isnt it admiral  you gonna tell him what you did  i did what i had to do  so tell him  its not gonna make any difference the past is the past  youre equivocating   i dont know why the frak i came here  tell him  hes gonna find out  sooner or later  i see it  go away  gods damn son of a bitch  i cant believe it  its really you  danny novacek  i heard you made it  good for you bulldog  oh gods  a drink  you have no idea  yes i do  dad  hey i just i just got your message  thank you for coming  sit down  its time for us to talk  let me ask you something  how often you get out of here  why all the time  ive been a little under the weather thats all  and howd you wind up on this old bucket anyway  what happened to valkyrie  well uh lets just say  that last mission wasnt exactly a boon to the old mans career  galactica was his graceful retirement  heard you and the old man havent spoken in a while  whats wrong  he wont cover your ass day and night like he used to  oh no he still does his share of asscovering  problem is its his main function now  of course  considering how you wound up getting captured in the first place  i guess you found that out the hard way yourself didnt you  whats that supposed to mean  my gods  he didnt tell you did he  did he  tell me what  that son of a bitch  i shot him down  well if you shot him down you had your reasons you were following orders  preventing something worse   right  no  i shot him down to avoid  detection  protect the mission  so it wouldnt be discovered by the cylons  it was a black ops mission  whose sole purpose  was to ascertain the likelihood of a cylon strike  cylon strike  so youre saying  that we knew they were out there  they could launch an attack on the colonies  we didnt know anything for sure  there were theories in some circles  that the reason that the cylons had stayed dormant for so long  was because they were building a war machine  preparing a strike  but i thought  i thought that no one had seen or heard from the cylons in over 40 years  thats true partially  the admiralty  had grown restless with the adar administration  they thought we were resting on our laurels  unprepared to protect against an attack  my mission was to escort a stealth recon ship  just beyond the armistice line  stick our nose over gather evidence  see if there was any suspicious activities  and if the cylons discovered you across the line  breaching the armistice then they would see that as  an act of war  stealthstar valkyrie we register you on dradis  just past the armistice line  youre on full alert proceed with caution  valkyrie bulldog  im exactly two clicks past the line  repeat two clicks and ive got  negative dradis contacts  theres nothing here sir  which is fine by me  company wants to pay me for a joy ride they came to the right driver  helluva moon  dradis contact unknown vessel just jumped in  krypter krypter krypter ive got  damage to the port engine bird is down repeat bird is down  request rescue  krypter krypter krypter this is bulldog  vessel just jumped out sir  bird is down request rescue  krypter krypter krypter this is bulldog  bird is down repeat  two more dradis contacts sir please instruct  what are your orders sir  sir what are your orders  dont do this  think about it bill you dont want to do this  do you want his ship discovered  do you know where we are  do you have any idea what this could mean  bogies on intercept course will merge with stealthstar in 20 seconds  sir  weapons  launch shiptoship missile now  no   there is no way  oh its true  and you know its true  youve known it every second of every day since it happened  and the sooner you admit it  the sooner you might get that haunted look out of your eyes  listen to me  sometimes surviving can be its own death sentence  i know that  so the attack on novaceks ship  the one that winged him  and the two dradis contacts that were following him  they werent taurons those were the cylons  for all those years i told myself  that i didnt know what they were  but i was just lying to myself  pretending that it couldnt be true  it is true  i started it  initiated it  wait a minute  you started what  started what  the attacks on the colonies  by crossing the line  i showed them that  we were the warmongers  they figured us to be  and i  i left them but one choice  to attack us  before we attacked them  no  no  because it wasnt just you  they put you there  they put you there across the line you had no choice  that was the admiralty that was the that was the military  you were one mission  you were one man  one man  it only takes one  youre all right  yeah of course  more nightmares  dreams  something different this time though  i think gods trying to tell me something   its about gaius isnt it  no  its not  its about something much bigger than that  after you execute this command  youll delete the order from your logs  then overwrite the corresponding memory locations  execute  its okay its okay  relax try to breathe through it  breathe  oh theres something beautiful  miraculous between life and death  thats weird  why the hell do they keep missing  frak  adama  admiral you have a call from lt novacek   put him through  bill   yes  this is danny   we need to talk  hold on   i need to see you right now  hold on ill be right there  the cylons are saddled up on him  theyve got a perfect pointblank nodeflection shot   they had him dead to rights  id say so  look novacek was hit and smoking flying straight and level  any nugget could make that kill  the cylons couldve wasted him any number of times and they didnt  they didnt they let him escape  the cylons dont do anything by accident  yeah thats what i was thinking too  did novacek say  how he was able to overcome the cylons that were holding him prisoner  they were sick had a virus  i mean how many viruses do the cylons have sir  who knows maybe it was the same virus  those cylons we found were suffering from  yeah or maybe they just told us a story that wed buy  something that was credible familiar  novacek was held prisonner on a baseship for three years  escapes and then conveniently finds our fleet  with no agenda and no reason to be here  hey dan  its funny how all the training comes back  why did you lie to me bill  all those years  you know what i kept telling myself  what stupid frakkedup dream i held onto  i kept thinking  just hang in there bulldog  bill adamas coming  he wont leave you to rot in here not him he wont leave a man behind  just hold on but you werent coming  you didnt think i was alive you werent even hoping i was alive  and if i hadnt figured a way to escape  if i didnt make my move when i saw they left that door wide open for me  id be as good as dead right now  is that what they did  did they leave the door standing open did they let you escape  thats not what i meant  i know the truth  i beat them do you understand  i beat them at their own game  i frakking killed her and i escaped  you trying to take that away from me  bulldog  stay down  are you all right bill  yeah im okay  you dont wanna believe it do you i know  the truth hurts bulldog  but its better to know the truth than to live a lie  were all soldiers danny  were all expendable  and we did what we had to do to protect the mission  its ugly but there it is the cylons let you go  the question is why ask yourself that danny  because up until a minute ago  you were doing exactly what they wanted you to do  come here and learn the truth and seek revenge  and thats exactly what you did  you almost gave them what they wanted  tell you a dirty little secret  the toughest part of getting played  is losing your dignity  feeling like you are not worth the oxygen you are sucking down  you get used to it  you start to believe it  you start to love it  its like a bottle that never runs dry  you can keep reaching for it over and over and over again  so how do you put that bottle away saul  i dont know  one day you just decide to  get up and walk out of your room  what is this  your resignation you have gotta be kidding me  i said before  we cant hide from the things weve done  i see no other way around this situation  maybe its time laura  sit down bill  i think youre being naive  naive  did it ever occur to you that the admiralty  may have set you up to provoke a war they wanted  its naive to think that horrible things that we cant understand  have simple explanations  because simple explanations make us feel like we have control when we dont  we know why the cylons attacked us and it wasnt any one thing my gods  we did a thousand things  good and bad  every day for 40 years to pave the way for those attacks  something has to be done  you know what that is  medal of distinction  this was before i heard about this resignation of yours  so  id like to propose this  you seem hellbent on paying some kind of penance  for whatever it is you think youve done  so instead of resigning why dont you get up and walk out of here  meet me on the port hangar deck tomorrow evening for this ceremony  and let me pin a frakkin medal to your chest  i cant  its not for you  its for them  stand up there acknowledge your fleet  and give them what they need  a hero  and thatll be your penance  even if it kills you  on behalf of everyone in this room it is my pleasure to present you  admiral adama  with the medal of distinction  for your 40 years of courageous service to the colonial fleet  congratulations  have dr stoffa call me as soon as you arrive  and bulldog youre gonna be fine   just remember itll take some time  all right  lieutenant  you forgot something   i cant bill i  take it  youre not gettin off that easy  once a pilot always a pilot bulldog  yes sir  come in  i heard you won a medal  yeah  they give em out for anything these days  good behavior  attendance playing well with others  i need you back in the cic  it just aint the same without you in there intimidating the inmates  no  thats not what i came here to talk to you about  okay  so why are you here  i dont know nothing  you wanna tell me what happened to ellen  i could use a drink  me too  we thank you  to watch battlestar galactica with our subs
