admiral  wait one  were receiving a download admiral  that is the cylon fleet  are these from our recon mission   no sir the recon mission was aborted these are from blackbird  thrace  she took off and did the whole recon mission alone  my gods look at these shots jack  she put her nose right up their backsides and they never even knew it  admiral i still have commander adama on the line and our fighters are stil requesting instructions  should they resume the attack   all right joint recall  both ships stand down to condition two  then i want you to report to me directly in person  i have no intention of coolling my heels in your brig  fine  neutral ground colonial one  no aides  be there in 15 minutes  stand down condition two  there you are  season 2  episode 11 resurrection ship  lets start this by admitting an ugly truth  what happened out there today was the result of failure in leadership of everyone in this room  we are the leaders of this fleet  as such we need to set an example  we cannot continue to let the conflicts between us  oh lets just cut through the handholding shall we   two of his men murdered on of my officers  while protecting a cylon  theyre guilty they admitted it  and under regulations i have complete authority to try convict and sentence them  and you and i both know that the penalty for that crime is death  admiral surely  the spirit of the law requires something more here than summary executions  is this what the two of you have been doing for the past six months   debating the finer points of colonial law  well guess what were at war   and we dont have the luxury of academic debate over these issues  you wanna cut through it fine  you have pegasus he has galactica  two heavily armed very powerful warships  now i am sure that pegasus would prevail in any fight  i wouldnt count on that  but certainly thered be heavy damage and youd take significant casualties  so you can go out there and fight it out with galactica or you can compromise  and those are the only two options on the table period  how the two of you have survived this long i will never know  all right  lieutenant thrace has sent me detailed recon information on the cylon fleet i want that fleet  and i need galactica to get it so im willing to go this far  ill suspend the execution until after the attack  and i want them back on galactica  i dont give a damn what you want youre frakking lucky youre not staring at your own warrant  the destruction of the cylon fleet will take priority over all other considerations  after that we will meet back here and we will resolve this issue  thank you  stand at ease lieutenant and come forward  seems youve had quite a day  im promoting you to captain im making you commander of the pegasus air group  youre promoting me   i need a cag with guts and initiative to plan and lead the attack on this fleet  now i thought stinger was that man  but he managed to let captain adama contact you and pull off that flyby right under his nose so  hes out  and captain adama sir   truth be told i came this close to throwing him in the brig  but i couldnt exactly charge him and not you so i just revoked his flight status  i want him on my team sir  and do you always get what you want   most of the time sir  good  me too  all right you can have him  i hear you want to return to caprica  yes sir  we have people back there still alive  yes and they deserve to be saved i absolutely agree  in fact i will go one step further  and i will say that our ultimate goal  is that we should return to the 12 colonies and kick the cylons the frack out of our homes  what do you think of that captain   i think thats the best idea ive heard all day sir  im afraid this can only end one way  weve got to kill her  what the hell are you talking about   like she said lets cut through it  the two of you were willing to go to war today do you think shes going to step down from that   shes going to bide her time  and hit you the first chance she gets thats a given  i hate to lay this on you bill but she is dangerous  and the only thing that you can do is to hit her before she hits you  im not an assassin  no  youre not an assassin you are a colonial officer  whos taken an oath to protect this fleet  what do you think that she is going to do with the civilian fleet  once she has eliminated you   you know im right  you just dont want to face it  so the whole worlds going mad   your fluid and electrolytes levels are stable  but i think the babys going to be fine you do have a cracked rib though  hairline fracture which means its gonna hurt like hell for a while  but im not seeing any signs of permanent damage from the attack  the attack  is that what were calling it now   they were not from the galactica  they were from the pegasus  so what   what about helo and the chief   i heard a rumor theyre going to be executed  im not going to let that happen  well how are you going to do that   isnt admiral cain in command    what happened to you  was unforgivable  happened aboard my ship on my watch and its my responsibility  so i just want you to know that i personally apologize  see that shes okay then back into her cell  arent we supposed to be dead   everyone said execution in an hour its been at least two  ah im not complaining  id confirmed  so just how many different kinds of stupid are you   more than we can count  whats going on captain  good news youre not dead yet  bad news its a delay not a pardon  theres a big op coming up and the firing squads on hold till its over  yeah the old man went to mat for you guys on this one  and then some  we were this close to a shooting war with the pegasus  frack me  what the hells going on  thought the cylons were the enemy  yeah now its us  whats wrong gaius   nothing  nothing  i suppose i just uh  lost interest   in me   no not in you in  in this in this place  i suppose i just dont really miss it anymore  you know what i miss   sports  youre joking  no  i used to go the pyramid court just before game time  scalp two tickets  if i timed it right id just be sitting down at the horn  sit back let the energy of the crowd flow over me  waves and waves of emotion  like an electric current  why did you get two tickets   one for me and one for you  i know id never get you to go pyramid was far too lowbrow for you but  i always liked to feel that you were there with me  id confirmed  well i see that you got it to eat  thats progress i suppose  can you get it to roll over beg   see what it can make of these  you know this thing used to sit in our mess  and eat our food and listen to our stories  didnt you   you just sat there  listening to us pretending to be our friend didnt you   admiral please   any physical contact with the subject  will only to set my efforts back at this point  find out about that ship  i want to die  will you help me do that   will you kill me please   hey im just still getting up to speed on the way you do things around here  but im reasonably sure that we can have all our birds in the air for the attack thing sure  i mean um yes sir  thank you chief  cally  lairds not military is he   no sir  he was a civilian aeronautical engineer on a ship called   the scylla  civilian   do you know how he got on the pegasus   scuttlebutt is that the pegasus used to have a civilian fleet  but something happened to them  thank you  lairds ship was the scylla  scylla was uh  civilian transport  we found her and  a few other civvies about a week after the attack  they were good ships  ftl drives and weapons even  a lot of potential spare parts that we could use on pegasus  so the admiral made a decision  military needs  are a priority  you stripped them  you stripped the ships for parts   sweet mother of artemis  how much equipment did you take   you take their jump drives    left all those people marooned out there   no not all  admiral cain looked over the passenger list  and she made a decision about who was valuable and who wasnt  scylla was the toughest  laird and 15 other men and women they were all  all traveling with their families  wives husbands children  the selectees  they refused to go  there was resistance  so the order came down  to shoot the family of anyone  who refused to come  so we did  two families we put them up against the bulkhead  and we shot them  a cags work is never done  hi how ya doing   oh you mean apart from being demoted   finding myself working for one of my pilots   great never better  you know i had nothing to do with that right   never thought you did  i just checked in on helo and tyrol  theyre hanging tight for now  good  help me plan this op  ive been staring at this roster  you wanna just carry on  as if nothings happened   lee shes in command what do you want to do   theres nothing we can do  i thought you might like a fresh set of clothes  were you aware of your true nature as a cylon when you boarded the ship   or would you describe you as a sleeper agent   i knew what i was  i was a soldier i had a mission i carried it out  i thought that when it was done i was going to die  that you would kill me  then i  then i would download into a new body  be reborn  but you didnt kill me  the things you did to me  what they did to you was wrong  evil  but im not one of them  you have to believe me  things are going to get better for you  from this moment on  i promise  i dont want things to get better i want to die  but you know you cant die  you do know that dont you   your consciousnessill merely transfer and youll wake up in another body  not if you destroy that  what this  this ship   tell me  whats so important about this ship   the cylons call this their resurrection ship  at the moment we are too far away from the cylon home world  for the normal downloading process to work which is why they built this ship  it contains the entire apparatus necessary for cylon resurrection  now this ship  has been traveling with the fleet trailing galactica for the last several months  so its a safety net   a place where they fall back to when they die  and if they lose their safety net   then any cylon who dies out here  would be dead  as in really dead  i daresay they wont like that  no sir  they might even stop chasing us  why risk getting killed if you cant just wake up  all nice and cozy in a brandnew body   doctor i think you just identified the most important ship in the galaxy  i have good days and bad days but  dont look so worried im not dying today  sorry  what can i do for you   you were right about cain  pegasus had a civilian fleet with her   cain stripped them  for parts supplies  people  i wish i could say i was surprised but its who she is  shes playing for keeps youve gotta do the same  whats gotten into you   youve become so bloodyminded  i know that as long as cain lives  your survival is at risk i know that  what can i get you   a new body  perhaps one of those young cylon models from the resurrection ship  i cant see you as a blonde  youd be surprised  well see you tomorrow   commander  she wont hesitate to kill you  dont let her  you know when we get outta here  im gonna make some changes  yeah   like what   me and sharon  its done  i mean really done i cant do it anymore  dont get me wrong  lt what we did  i would do again  in a heartbeat  but ive gotta let it go  i so thought i had let go  yeah  i know what you mean  you   yeah me  what   you think i dont have second thoughts sometimes   you think i dont wonder im losing my frakkinmind   im in love a woman i know isnt a woman  im having a baby thats  thats what   half machine   you really do love her dont you   yeah  yes i do  and i cant let go of it  but if you can  let it go  our primary objective is a vessel named resurrection by the cylons  its guarded by two basestars  which have been following us throughout this sector  our plan  simply put is to let them find us  we will wait in this system here  and appear to be conducting mining operations  when the cylons launch the raiders galactica and most of the civilians will jump away  a small group of civilians will be left behind  to the cylons theyll appear to be having trouble with their ftl drives  and attempting to escape at sublight speed  the cylon raiders pursue the civilian decoys  pulling the raiders farther away from the cylon basestars as they can  once the raiders have been drawn off by the decoys  galactica and pegasus will jump in  and attack the basestars  while i jump in  in the blackbird stealth fighter  and take out the ftl drives on the resurrection ship preventing it from jumping away  why not have the stealth ship carry nukes and destroy it right at the start  we ran simulations on that  we determined that the cylons would detect the nuclear warheads  and destroy the stealth ship before it got within weapons range  when the ftl is destroyed  galactica and pegasus will take on the basestars  and our attack squadrons will go after the resurrection ship itself  how many squadrons  all ofem  is there a problem  i need time to study the operational details  suit yourself  ive gone over the details and im satisfied  i want your cag to stay and help me  answer some of my questions  one hour thrace  yes sir  stay focused son  jack i want to transfer a detachment of marines to galactica  and i want you to handpick them  completely reliable  completely loyal  razors  i have a mission for you kara  anything for you you know that  dont accept too quickly  you wont like this one  i dont like it  but ive decided that it has to be done  im transferring you to galactica as well  ill tell adama that youre there to be my eyes and ears  hell hate it  hell think youre my spy and try to freeze you out of decisionmaking  but hell accept it  now i want you to stay in cic throughout the attack  stay with adama  after the attack is completed  and youve accounted for your pilots  i want you to land your bird on the pegasus to report  directly to cic  youll take lee with you  hell watch your back  position marines in key areas throughout the ship and keep a squad posted just outside cic  therell the normal chaos emotional high after the attack  theyll be slapping each other on the back celebrating the victory  theyll keep their guard down  security will be lax  i will ask for you  over the wireless  i will call you directly and when i have you on the line  and you hear me give the command execute case orange  when you hear me say downfall  you are to signal the marines to terminate adamas command  starting with adama  i want you to pull out your weapon  and shoot admiral cain in the head
