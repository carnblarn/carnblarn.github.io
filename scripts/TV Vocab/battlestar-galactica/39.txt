                previously on battlestar galactica  i sharon agathon  will carry out the lawful orders of my superiors  as an officer in the colonial fleet  congratulations lieutenant  were talking about people blowing themselves up  i got one job here lady and one job only  to disrupt the cylons  make them worry about this anthill theyve stirred up down here  so theyre distracted and out of position  when the old man shows up in orbit  you know the mission  you should also know theres only one way that this mission ends  and thats with the successful rescue of our people  off of new caprica  evacuate the entire facility  you should go as well gaius theres a place for you too  captain hi   whos this  this is   kacey  oh my little girl  when the cylons took her i thought  but you saved her  gods bless you  a lot of good people had to pay the price for what they did  choices they made on new caprica  like my wife  thats right  ellen collaborated  gave the cylons information on the resistance and she died for it  i cant believe theres still a question of my value  there will always be a question  youre human  good to see you  i far prefer these picturesque settings for our interludes  dont you  i thought you had abandoned me to your cylon comrades  would i do that  youve always been more unpredictable  than your flesh and blood counterparts  a man that loves women as much as you  should have learned that a long time ago  im a slow learner  then take this period as a time to learn all you can about the cylons   youll need it in the days ahead  something special on the horizon  cylon psychology is based on projection  projection  its how they choose to see the world around them  the only difference  is you choose to see me  what are you  really  youre either connected to the woman i knew on caprica  or youre a damaged part of my subconscious  struggling for selfexpression so which one is it  im an angel of god sent here to help you  just as i always have been  were all part of one big ecosystem  yes i can feel it    breathing  get used to it  so whatd he say  i havent asked him yet  asked me about what  earth   what  earth its the 13th colony  do you know how to find it  not really no  well thats unfortunate  there was a hope my hope  that if you knew the way to earth  it would justify keeping you alive a little longer  come on six  wait wait wait  now when i say  that i do not know exactly where earth is  that is not to say that i do not know a very great deal  about its probable location  honestly i spent hours days weeks months and months  on a map that adama and roslin found on kobol  and i correlated that with  astrometric observations i doubt anyone here can make the same claim  well get back to you  what do you care about finding earth  because were looking for it  you are  yes weve decided that earths going to be our new home   shiptoship training exercise is authorized  you may commence when ready  this is apollo red team set  blue team set  red team apollo  as soon as we clear the moon were gonna be on their dradis  so keep your eyes up  theyre gonna hit us with everything they got  stay in formation starbuck narcho youre my wingman  blue team kat  lets show these lazy fraks how its done  red team starbuck i got hotdog  im hit  red team apollo im going after kat  got you  youre gonna have to do better than that apollo come on  ill take care of kat  starbuck you stay in formation narcho has kat  inbound  starbuck youre too close  frak  compressor blew looks like it threw a blade  severed the fuel line cally check the tank  gods its something  the tanks bone dry theres not even fumes in here  captain howd you land this thing  pointed it toward the deck and stopped when i got here  bone dry she says landed the bird without a drop of fuel  if you want to die  i will open up an airlock for you  but you are not taking one of my vipers with you  the birds on the deck  im on the deck i dont know what youre bitching about  i dont give a frak what youre doing starbuck  youre done flying  i cant believe you did that to me  what   dont look at me like that  oh my gods  ellen  ellen  excuse me hey make a hole  ellen  if ive told you once ive told you 1000 times  ellen im right here  what is this let go of me  kara kara  kacey   kara kara  captain thrace  im sorry dont you remember me im julia prynne im kaceys mom   yeah i remember  give me a hug  weve been staying over in the  everyones calling it camp oil slick part of the hangar deck  and theyve put up cots for you know refugees  yeah i heard  well kaceys been asking to see you for days  i sent messages i thought maybe youd come for a visit  you seem like a really nice person so im gonna be honest with you  the last thing i need is a twoyearold friend  and kacey sure as hell does not need me in her life  so do us both a favor and do not bring her around here again okay  go to your mom kase  sure  sorry dont let us keep you up  sorry honey we gotta go  there it goes  thats it see  see i told you could do it  you did great  remind me never    to let that happen again  you got it slim  ever  ive been trying to reassemble president bal  dr baltars work on piecing together  the 13th tribes path to earth  im curious mr gaeta what is it that you trust about dr baltars research  how do you know its not another one of his lies  if there was one thing i learned about baltar  it was his extraordinary capacity for selfpreservation  i think he wanted to find earth because  he wanted to get there  how far did he get with his research  well as you can see im still hacking through his notes  but it appears that he was trying to correlate  our own astrometric readings  with the map of constellations that we found back on kobol  and apply his findings to certain select passages  within the scroll of pythia  why the scroll of pythia  pythia is supposed to have chronicled  the original journey of the 13th tribe on its way to earth  look at this passage  and the caravan of the heavens was watched over  by a great lion  with a mighty blinking eye red and blue   exactly  exactly what   youre looking for a lions head  with a mighty blinking eye  blinking  well theyre scrolls they speak in metaphors  initially i thought the doctor might be off his meds as well sir  but then i found this note  here  where he had written blinking equals pulsar  that means a star right  plural actually  theyre the rotating cores of dead stars  they emit a blast of radio waves   from a distance they appear to   blink  right  the doctor found two in very close mutual orbit  within this sector  the spectrographic readings that i found  show one will appear to be red  and one will appear to be blue  now  these pulsars appear to be in this nebula  we have never had a direct look at this area  but it is possible with  a couple of eyeballs out there they might look at the nebula and see  a giant lions head  well it looks like this is the best thing weve got going so  unless you object admiral  i suggest we go to lion hunting  the navigational markers you gave us may prove useful  they sent a base ship out to investigate the pulsars  and look for this lions head of yours  look this isnt easy for me  i dont think you fully appreciate just how difficult this is  i have very conflicted  very ambiguous feelings about helping you find earth  funny how all that ambivalence and conflict seemed to vanish  once you thought your life hung in the balance  you should know theres still a lot of skepticism about  whether youre being entirely truthful  im very sorry  we didnt mean to intrude  come on gaius  are we going round in circles  im sure it all looks the same to you doesnt it  be hard for any human to navigate around here especially without projecting  yes youve used that word before im not  quite sure what youre talking about it helps you to what exactly  have you ever daydreamed  and imagined that you were somewhere else  i do have an active imagination  well we dont have to imagine we project  we choose to see our environment in any form we wish whenever we wish  for instance right now you see us as standing in a hallway  but i see it as a forest  filled with trees birds sunlight  like the walks that you and i used to take  on caprica  the aesthetic is what gives me pleasure  not the specific memories  instead of staring at blank walls i choose to surround myself  with a vision of gods creation  right i think i understand projection  but its a bit of a coincidence isnt it  that i could see such  a vivid reality that ive created  and the cylon projection experience seems to be so similar  is it a coincidence  well what are you saying  theres a connection  what because of my experiences with you  am i a cylon  what was that  oh nothing just talking out loud  silly me  so you sure you want to go in the second seat again  i mean i hear youre a pretty fair pilot now  well too many pilots not enough birds  anything to keep me flying at this point  you want me im yours boomer  uh no boomer was she was someone else  listen up  we need a call sign for lieutenant agathon   chrome dome  titanium   carburetor  windup toy  tin can   toaster babe  transistor  how bout athena   digital dame  wait  what was that  you know the goddess of wisdom and war  usually accompanied by the goddess of victory   that works out  i like it  athena it is  so say we all  hey colonel  colonel come have a seat   over here  enough of that to go around  always  dead mans chest cutthroat game not usually your style  it is now  and im in it to win you dont like it find another game  oh theres some straight talk  seen the line up outside the head  in line picking their noses  and waiting to take a shower  frakin civilians think they run the ship now  beats what we had before the ship was like a tomb  you want to know what alone feels like  try spending a few weeks in a cylon holding cell  yeah  it was a bitch on both sides  and it wasnt exactly easy coming up with a plan to save your sorry butts  you guys had it rough huh  hot showers three squares a day  viper jocks didnt even take a shot till you jumped into orbit   we all made sacrifices  is that so  yes thats right  while you were pinning wings on your cylon girlfriend  our people were strapping homemade bombs to their chests  doing whatever they could to take the bastards out  so forgive me  if i dont get all misty over your sacrifices  you seem distracted gaius  do i  you can rest easy at least for now  the data on earths location and your valiant rescue of the baby  has gone a long way toward impressing the others  i used to think you and i would have a baby one day  there are only 12 cylon models  but in the entire occupation on new caprica i only saw seven  now here again the same seven  who are the final five  i cant talk about that   cant or wont  i cant  its complicated but we dont talk about them  ever  but youd know one of them wouldnt you if you saw one of the final five   if they were to walk past here  six we have a problem  a baseship  the one we sent to investigate the pulsars in the lion nebula  weve lost contact  the trouble is we know almost nothing about the missing baseships status  we received a garbled distress call then silence  not surprisingly their hybrid sent us a confusing set of data   our hybrid is analyzing it  what are these hybrids   hes talking about  be quiet gaius  our hybrids deciphered part of the data that we received from our scout ship  this cant happen to us its impossible  it is not only possible  it may have been inevitable once we took human form  were not human  were not like him  god has chosen this time this place to test us  whether we fail or pass the test is up to us  whats going on  the missing baseship its been infected by some kind of disease   disease  yes its killing them  all of them  if an infected cylon dies and carries this disease  into a resurrection ship it could rapidly spread  potentially infecting our entire race  we make sure that the resurrection ship is out of range  then we jump to their location   send in a group of centurions  no  as soon as the hybrid was infected the centurions started shutting down  we dont know how ours are gonna be affected  i assume our raiders and baseships are also susceptible  of course  we are all created from the same genetic pool  then no cylon can board that ship without risking infection  say youll go aboard the infected baseship  and investigate what happened  you sent them to that nebula remember  are you mad  you have to prove to them you can be counted on in an emergency  show them youre worth keeping alive  and what if i catch the disease  what are the chances that a human  could catch something that infects a centurion or a raider  that is if youre human and if youre really a cylon   one of the final five you havent seen yet   wouldnt you rather just get it over with and die  ill go  what  yes ill go  look i am a trained scientist  i can go to the baseship  i can make observations about the cylons their physical condition  bring back information about this disease which now threatens all of you  weve learned the disease thats killing the human cylons  could infect one of our raiders as well  then dont send a raider  surely the wars furbished you with some   colonial vessels  hes right we could program one of our raptors to approach on autopilot  all right then prepare to jump the ship  make sure the resurrection ship knows to stay behind out of range  a truly selfless act  i could use a refill here  here  heres to knowing  that somebody will always have your back  yeah the sentiments right but in my book  trust is an overrated commodity  mmm that one ill drink to  frak you guys   what is your problem katraine  my problem is you captain  and all this us against them crap  truth hurts doesnt it gimme another one  you know what whatever happened to you down there  why dont you take it out on the cylons cause we busted our ass   to get you off that rock  do you think that means anything  every colonist that landed on new caprica was loyal to a point  it was amazing watching those people  that you thought you knew go over to the cylons  at least in the end we knew where we stood huh  is that so  then how come you are off flight duty  and some cylon lover is holding down my post  dont kid yourselves youre on your own in this life  each and every one of us  why dont you tell that to the pilots that died getting you off that rock  and gaetas briefing sharon and racetrack  on the scouting mission to the pulsars  you mean athena and racetrack   word travels fast  yes it does  i understand that morales taken a hit on the flight deck  nothing we cant handle sir  im also told that colonel tigh is spending a lot of time  down in the pilots rec room  both him and starbuck sir  theyve been holding court  secondguessing the rescue badmouthing the crew that stayed up with galactica  suddenly if you werent in the ground war its like you cant be trusted  people are listening  their word carries a lot of weight  youre right theyre destroying morale and unit cohesion  they both know better  i dont think they care sir  two protons expelled at each coupling site creates the mode of force  the embryo becomes a fish that we

paragraph  ftl system check  do you have any idea what its talking about  no  most cylons think the conscious mind of the hybrid  has simply gone mad and the vocalizations we hear are meaningless  but not everyone thinks that  the ones you know as leoben  believe that every word out of her mouth means something  that god literally speaks to us through her  she sort of controls the baseship does she  she is the baseship in a very real sense  mind gone mad  she experiences life very differently than we do gaius  she swims in the heavens  laughs at stars breathes in cosmic dust  maybe leobens right  maybe she does see god  were wasting time   they cry for succor in the dark of the light  jump  there are bodies everywhere  others dying  what the hells that  definitely manmade  youre severely dehydrated you must drink some water  kill me  you dont understand there is no resurrection ship nearby  you will not be downloaded into a new body you will just be gone  i saw how they died  please  please i cant bear that  im here to bring help all right  im just gonna take some blood samples for analysis on the baseship  and then we will be able to make a treatment for the disease  you must breathe please   please take some water  youre  youre from galactica  no  im from a baseship  tell me  do you know what this is  we found it floating at these coordinates  must be some kind of  beacon   or marker  it looks too old it looks very old  mustve been left by the 13th tribe  it was infected poisoned  left by some humans like you to destroy us  what  a human device  filled with a pestilence   you sent us to this place  it wasnt me  you know wed bring it aboard  you dont know what youre saying  this is the disease speaking through you  calm down   i am going to bring help  you knew it was here  you and the other baseships  i would never do anything to hurt you  you and the other baseships knew it was here  be quiet be quiet   be quiet i am going to bring help  you want to destroy us all  its your fault you lie to them   shut up  you lie to them   you want to destroy us all  shut up be quiet  shut up  shut up  gaius do you hear us  gaius do you read are any of them alive  gaius baltar what do you see speak to us  what do you see are any of them alive  this is gaius baltar   im returning to the baseship  what do you see  i see nothing  nothing of consequence  theres nothing left to do here  nobody likes it but we have to make a terrible choice  do we attempt a rescue  and risk the lives of our fleet even our species or do we leave them  the answer wont be found in science because theres no cure in science   well there has to be  do we just leave them  then theyre condemned to death  they must be sacrificed for the greater good  there is a greater question  yes there is  how did this happen   baltar  its baltar  its his fault he led us there deliberately  hes been working with galactica the whole time  it wasnt me  whatever you think i did i didnt do honestly  we followed your coordinates and found a disease with no treatment or cure  clearly theyre doomed never to return  perhaps god would smile upon us for our mercy  oh listen to you you can barely even speak his name  we have to leave them  we have to jump and leave them to their fate there is no other way  mists of dreams drip along the nascent echo  and love no more  end of line  the hybrid objects  she doesnt get a vote  jump the ship  jump  this disease  it mustve come from someplace  so what did you notice on the infected ship  nothing nothing i am just as baffled as you are  you noticed nothing suspicious on the infected ship  nothing whatsoever  admiral on deck  admiral  give me the room  stay in your seat  have a drink  give me your sidearm  what  your sidearm  hey theres a live round in that  now one of you and i dont care who  pick that weapon up and shoot me   admiral i dont know  i didnt say to talk  youve done enough of that already  i said to pick up that weapon and shoot  whats the matter  no guts  you dont got a pair  youre both frakking cowards   watch your mouth  or what  you going to turn the rest of my pilots against each other  poison the crew  youve already done that saul  both of you  yeah well if youre looking for an apology it isnt gonna happen  you were like a daughter to me once no more  youre malcontented  and a cancer  and i wont have you on my ship  so you have a choice  you figure out how to become a human being again and an officer  or you can find another place to live off of this ship  youre dismissed  are you gonna kick me out of my chair too   i know youve been through a lot  dont patronize me  you say what you came here to say  youre full of bile hatred  and i know that it has something to do with ellen and im sorry for that  and if you need time saul well you take all the time you want  but i gotta run a ship  the last thing i need  is a oneeyed drunk sitting down here  sowing discontent disobedience  so ill tell you once again saul  you can pick up that weapon and kill me  or you can get your ass back into your quarters and not leave  until youre ready to act like the man that ive known for the past 30 years  that man doesnt exist anymore bill  and you wont be seeing me again  oh my gods its right there  the lions head nebula and the blinking eye  holy crap its the road to earth  oh my gods  lets get the frak out of here  ill start the jump  when gods anger awakens  even the mighty shall fall  frak athena we need to get out of here   thanks to watch battlestar galactica with our subs
