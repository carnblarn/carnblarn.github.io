                previously on battlestar galactica  colonel fisk is the new pegasus commander  the cylons fetus contains no antigens  it makes it universal donor  are you saying you found a cure for the presidents cancer   yes  ive got ships on half rations  when will some of these supplies start getting out to the fleet   targets ftl is history shes all yours  hes all right repeat again appollo is all right  lets just be glad that we both came back alive all right   thats just it kara  i didnt want to make it back alive  youre not going to shoot  youre not like me  hey hey  hey dont go  sorry  i though you were still asleep  you should have kicked me out of bed an hour ago  if i hold up galacticas raptor  tighll have my ass  which me both know currently belongs to me  all right lets move on to the the next item  oh no gentlemen please dont get up  after the last few weeks it just feels good to be on my feet  thank you though  youve made a remarkable recovery madame president  remarkable indeed  but now im playing catchup  and im afraid during my illness i lost focus  i let some things slide  thats behind us now  yes it is  to the point  supplies are running low and the people are worried  well they wouldnt be civilians if they didnt have something to bitch about  well i think that in this case theyre entitled  our inventory levels are tight  but theyre not critical but all the way across the fleet  people are reporting shortages of essential goods  and what they do get comes at a high price  theyre turning to the black market  last week one of my aides  came down with pneumonia billy had to trade liquor  to get the antibiotics  its the nature of the beast  people want what they want  a few trades would be one thing commander fisk thats reality  but im talking about criminals making outrageous demands on the people  so bottom line is im implementing a new fleetwide trade policy  we need to be in control of our supply chain  not black market thugs  i am hoping that i can have the militarys support on this  admiral  if you want pegasus to run these dogs down you just give us the word  our people will do whatever it takes to get this under control  and its good to have you back madame president  its good to be back thank you admiral  gentlemen thank you  is madame president always so right in your face  her lastminute resurrection seems to have invigorated her somewhat  yeah well maybe too much  she doesnt really think her madeup plans and regulations  to change anything does she   as if we dont have enough to do  no madame president sets a great prestige by her office  and adama supports her at least for the moment  well then so do i just for the moment  by the way did you get the cigars i sent over   i not only got them i enjoyed them as well  oh my pleasure mr vice president  well ive got a ship to run  look forward to our next visit  as do i  i got them from a friend  paya  hey sweetie  you seem to get an inch taller every time i see you  what i dont get my handshake   well its okay paya  i have  a special surprise for you  and its in here  you wanna come see   whats he got   come on  what have we got   paya  ive never been great with kids  maybe next time ill get one with two eyes  see if i can trade her for something else  no its okay  you just surprised her  well well  look im not sure  when ill be able to make it back  i know  im gonna have to ask for an extra hundred since you spent the night  well  i wondered when you were going to show up  season 2  episode 14  black market   raptor onetwoniner you are cleared into the break  galactica raptor onetwoniner has the ball  inbound speed twotwozero  admiral colonel  im just getting started but  from the looks of him id say he was garroted  gods this is the last thing we needed  admiral  you might want to take a look at this  looks like our friend fisk hit the jackpot  cubit  find anything else let me know right away  if i find anything else i may retire early  someones sending us a message  or running us in circles  maybe theres another cylon in the fleet  i almost prefer that to the alternative we start killing our own  all they have to do is sit back and watch  fisk  do we have any idea who did it  no  but we will do a full investigation and i want you to lead it  dont you think it would be better if someone from pegasus dealt with this  even though cains gone  her influence lingers  i need someone i can trust  you know there were times when that was in  short supply between us  weve both been through an awful lot son  and i hope that weve grown stronger for it  i need your help  ill call up a flight to pegasus right away  anyone else been inside  just the medical team sir  what  do you know who i am  i am the vice president of the colonies let me in  captain adama  commander fisk didnt tell me you were invited  let him in  they were going to let me in  oh my gods  whats going on in here  wheres fisk  on a slab in galacticas morgue  what hes dead  isnt this your brand  careful gaius  youve bought yourself some good will by saving roslin but its fading  their old suspicions are reemerging  what are you doing here  captain  i was about to ask you the same thing  wait a minute  are you interrogating me  im not sure i appreciate your tone  this isnt a diplomatic exercise  a man was butchered  his head was practically severed from his body with piano wire  youre vice president of the fleet  why are you acting like a child with your hand in the cookie jar hmm  wonder what she would say if she saw you like this  you know i cant believe its even necessary for me to explain myself to you  but obviously no i had nothing to do with commander fisks death  for the record i just came here to discuss president roslins new trade policy  oh ii thought that was settled  no uh commander fisk had some reservations  ill bet  and as the vice president i decided to assuage his doubts  of my own free will  is that sufficient  or would you like me to provide you with an alibi  im sure i can rustle one up  enjoy the cigars  escort the vice president to his ship  the wireless is going crazy  word of fisks murder has spread out through the entire fleet  when we lose a command officer aboard a warship  people are going to be concerned about their security  crew can fall apart when their commander is killed  pegasus lost two in a matter of weeks  maybe this time they were lucky  his personal log shows that he was rerouting supply runs  on and offloading freighters without command authorization  he raided the mcconnell and at least a dozen other ships in the last week  i also found a small warehouse  of high value merchandise in his quarters  he was working the black market  well half the fleets working it fisk was getting greedy  if he crossed one of his suppliers on a deal  that would explain the cubits that cottle found  still doesnt tell us who did it  well hes going to need trading partners  and they wouldnt be hard to find even on galactica  lee  im scared  payas cough keeps getting worse  ill bring her something on my next trip  which could be weeks if theres another cylon attack  i keep hearing about shortages on the other ships  people trading anything they can for food and for medicine  really  have you seen all the new working girls outside  lee when your babys crying because its hungry  youll do anything to make it stop  come here  mommy  captain  what do you want  is your wife around colonel  no why  is this hers  oh yeah  she lost it a couple weeks ago where the hell did you find it  on pegasus  in commander fisks quarters  shes burning up  what did they say at the infirmary  antibiotics have all been rationed out  they said they might have something by the end of the week  we got shortages across the fleet  people begging for scraps  somehow you and mrs tigh have fresh fruit real liquor  all right  what the hell is this about  you must have known she was trading with fisk  or maybe ill talk to her  she didnt give it to fisk i did  i traded it for a few necessities  a couple of things to help her get by big frackin deal  theres nothing illegal about that  not yet  dont you play holier than thou with me  i havent done anything that most people on this ship havent done  including you  doesnt make us right colonel just a whole lot of people wrong  you didnt make it to class today  yeah ive been pretty jammed up  anyway im not sure you need me holding your hand anymore  is that what you were doing  holding my hand  i meant it as a compliment  permission to speak frankly sir  you dont need my permission and you dont need the sir  maybe thats the problem  i dont really know what to think anymore  so ill just ask  is this going somewhere  dee  please dont pretend like you dont know what im talking about  you know our time together our workouts  somethings changed between us  im just not sure what you want me to say  then dont say anything  communications paging captain adama  you have a priority shiptoship call cloud nine  captain adama here  shevon shevon its me  oh my gods  what did they do  they said they knew about you and me  they wanted to know what wed been talking about  i dont understand why theyd care  all right get what you need  im taking you and paya back to galactica  lee wait  its the only place i can keep you safe  what are you going to tell them about us  im not fooling myself i know what this is  lee  get away from us  you listening  i hear any more talk about fisk im going send your whore back to you piece  by piece and then im going start with the little girl  i know who you are  i know whose son you are  and i dont care  you tell adama to let it go  is that when you knew that you loved her  i thought so  but you hurt her  this is captain adama  i need a medic and a security team on l deck asap  you wanted to see me madame president  yes  thank you for coming doctor  have a seat  would you like some tea  id love one  you know  im never quite sure where we stand with each other doctor  why do you think that is  i cant imagine why  ive never had anything but the utmost respect for you  and your office  i understand that you and commander fisk planned to meet just prior to his death  as i have already explained to captain adama  commander fisk had several lingering concerns about your new trade policy  what can i say  and thats it  gaius shes afraid of you  why  are you asking me this  you saved my life and im grateful  but i sense that there is some unease in you about assuming the presidency and  id like to offer you an out  you what  resign  return to your scientific work on galactica  no one will question your motives  you can consider it a second chance like the one you gave me  charming  doctor  this is a onetime offer  i suggest you reconsider  you know madame president  ive never been particularly interested in politics  i never wanted any lofty position of power  i never wanted to be the vicepresident  that is until this very moment  because right now  i cant think of anything i want more  one to the head  you didnt do this   i was attacked  found him there when i woke up  security bulletin said commander fisk was garroted with a wire  whatever happened looks like you found your guy  what about shevon and her daughter   cloud nines an open port chances are theyre already off ship  ill get a team down here  councilman zarek  lee  i just heard are you all right   what are you doing here   attending a quorum meeting  nothing as exciting as all this i assure you  i know these places are legal but still  the son of the almighty adama  talk to me about the black market  not much to say its widespread inevitable  and according to president roslin  illegal  so its no surprise that you and fisk were in it up to your necks  fisk maybe but not me  i represent astral queen  i have to be careful about the company i keep  this is fisks log  he says  he made three runs to astral queen in the last ten days  and i doubt it was to discuss prison reform  what do you want from me captain   names of ships  contacts  i cant help you  why do you think fisk approached me   to get a piece of your black market scam to offer you protection  you and your father are so blinded by the past  fisks black market  was up and running when he approached me  he knew adama would pick up on his unauthorized shuttles  so he tried to force me into taking over the deliveries  creating a firewall between pegasus and the illegal shipments  so youre trying to tell me that you turned him down  at great cost  check the fleet logs  see how many supply ships made stops at the astral queen after fisks last trip  the answer is none  so if fisk was trying to starve you out  why didnt you bring it to the quorum   roslins acting like the black markets some sort of aberration  but i thought you were smarter than that  did you really expect some  utopian fantasy to rise from the ashes   i heard the security officer  they gave you fisks killer for a reason  theyre offering you a way out  you know something dont you   just rumors  theres a freighter  prometheus  some people say its gone off the grid  but if you want something bad enough  thats where you go  the deals are brokered by an exmilitary mercenary named  phelan  lee  i hope shes worth it  paya  paya  paya  hey paya  its okay  its lee you remember its lee  youre going to be fine i promise you  okay you just hang tight  ill be right back  you may find this hard to believe but my father was in the service too  strict as hell  probably the same as your old man but  when the cylons attacked all his duty and honor  didnt add up to squat  is she dead   i can see why you want her back shes one of my best  one of yours  a good escort  understands its about a lot more than sex  she knows when to listen  and when to call for help  lee i had to  dont blame her  the only reason youre alive is because i was able to see you through shevons eyes  and what i saw seemed reasonable  like fisk  fisk was a pig  he tried to force us to renegotiate  so you killed him  no  i gave you the killer  the murder weapon  the prints  everything you needed to close the case legitimately  despite the presidents objections the fleet needs us  rationings too tight ship comes in too late  were the pressure valve we provide  when shevon needed antibiotics  she knew where to go  without us  people would have nowhere to turn  the fleet would tear itself apart  and what about those children outside   how are they  helping the fleet   everyone has needs  some settle for cigars or liquor  you wanted shevon  others are more  demanding  its hard to find the moral high ground  when were all standing in the mud  im not not like  my old man captain  and you  are not like yours  i came alone  but galactica tracked me on dradis  all theyll need to vent this ship into space is an excuse  so lets make a deal  i want shevon  the girl  i walk out of here  and you shut down this operation  and all of you will live  sorry  the little girls been paid for no refunds  oh gods no  wait  lee dont  come on do it  do it  i made you a fair offer  so did i  yeah youre probably right about everything  you me fisk  nobody can stop it  and maybe nobody should  but it needs limits  theres lines you cant cross  and youve crossed them  youre not gonna shoot  youre not like me  youre not gonna  all right its done  fleet relies on the black market  much as wed like we cant wish that away  so youre still in business  for now  but if they are any more killings  if you hold back essential medicines  if you  ever touch a child  shevon  no i dont want to see  its over everythings gonna be okay  lee let go  shevon its over  i cant be what you want me to be  i dont want you to be anything  you want me to be her  thats what this is about  thats what this has always been about  no  thats not what this has ever been about  come on lee i know my job  im a replacement  for a lot of things  things that men cant get anywhere else  things theyve lost  she wanted to give you a child  but you were afraid  so you pushed her away  and then you ran  and you didnt stop running until it was too late  well im not her  and paya is not and will never be your child  commander fisks murder has been resolved  and pegasuscrew appears to have accepted galacticas conclusions  thats all madame president  not quite  what about the ship prometheus   i understand its the hub of the fleets black market  we will keep an eye on them  keep an eye on em   its not exactly the solution i had in mind  whether or not we allow a criminal enterprise  to thrive in this fleet is not a matter of choice captain  admiral   ive given lee full authority on this issue  the decision is his  i support your trade policies wholeheartedly madame president  but we are never going to have a perfect system  there will always be some kind of black market  at least this way i know names i know faces  i know where they are and we will  monitor the situation  thank you gentlemen im busy   you should be sweating  20  why arent you doing any of these   no talking  no cheating all the way up  sneaky   start again zero  you lost track  president wasnt very happy today  no  ever since you ejected from the blackbird  youve been different  harder to reach  im just trying to understand  well like you said dad  weve all been through a lot  fair enough  but you should have told me about the woman  lords of kobol
