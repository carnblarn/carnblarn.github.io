                previously on battlestar galactica  youre gonna hold me in your arms  youre gonna tell me that you love me  youre insane  you kill me  i download  i come back we start over  i dont belong here let me out  some of those guys who joined up  bet theyre in over their heads you know   one day when this is all over  guys like that are gonna get strung up  guys like you and me  were gonna be there tying the knots  making them tight  where are you getting this stuff  whos your source   i have no idea  the source wont tell me what their name is  its probably safer for all of us   mr president   good morning gaeta  this is a death warrant  have you seen the names on this list   do you have any idea what theyre about to do out there   i got this from the deaddrop  from the source of the administration  its a death list and callys names on it  run  dont look back go   we were ambushed at the rendezvous  the cylons knew exactly where we were gonna be  that doesnt mean ellen had anything to do  this is the map that i drew for you   you were gonna burn it  but then your wife offered to do it for you  you know what has to be done here  now it would be better for her sake if it was you  come on  move   evacuate the entire facility  you should go as well gaius  theres a place for you too  walk   evidence for the following charges have been presented to the circle   that you carried arms for the enemy  that you carried out multiple raids  against the human population  and that during one raid  by you and your men  during the assault on the temple of artemis  thats not true  these are the names of the people killed   by you and those under your command   you look at those names   connor  the circle has examined the evidence and found you guilty of treason  and crimes against humanity  do you have anything to say before sentence is passed   i was trying to help people  you didnt do a very good job then did you   lets just get this over with  wha i helped people  i helped lots of people  chief chief   chief i helped cally i saved cally  i saved cally  what do you mean you helped cally   im the one who did  im the one who let her go when they were gonna shoot her  i took her out of line i said go run right now  run like hell get out of here and she did  she ran and she got away  because of me chief i helped cally  i saved cally  cally did get away somehow  they killed 23 people during the temple raids  and 3 children  children   my son is on this list  his name is right there  and that frakkin sonofabitch put him there  so saving cally if that happened  does that make up for killing my son   answer the question chief  does saving cally let him off the hook for killing 23 others   did you do this jammer   did you kill these people   answer me  it was crazy down there chief  you know that  you make this decisions so fast  youre making an arrest  and people come out with their hands up  but sometimes its just a trick  they tell you theyre surrendering and then they open fire  we thought they were insurgents  it wasnt till after we saw the bodies  what was i supposed to do   no it doesnt  under the articles  the punishment for treason is death  sentence confirmed and carried out  on this the third day of the second exodus   im sorry   thats too much frakkin talk  wait  im sorry   my son  kevin  he was only seven years old  lets go  come on  connor lets go  this isnt what i signed up for  hey sweetie   am i on watch   no no youre fine  here give him to me  come here you come here  come to daddy hey buddy  hey buddy there you go  i know  mommys much more comfortable than me huh   cally   when you were down on their planet  you ran away from the trucks  did anybody help you   one of the ncp goons or anybody   what   no   wait yeah  somebody told me to run  it probably was one of those goons  i havent thought about it since  hey how did you know about that   i mean why do you ask   no reason go back to sleep  okay   in my opinion it wasnt his fault  i hate to admit it but the admirals right  he was in an impossible situation  id have probably done the same in his position  well if thats the way it has to be  then thats the way it has to be  no hard feelings   mistakes were made  of that theres no question  but the past  is the past  i think we can all agree that wed like to move on  you fools  youre being too lenient he betrayed you  actively sought your deaths  doesnt that matter to you   dont you have any selfrespect   wouldnt bother if they cant hear you  dont make me angry gaius  you wouldnt like her when shes angry  ive always wanted you  oh no  what  im dreaming arent i   yes you are  hey  did you get any sleep   sleep when youre dead  nice  what is all that   i got my gear out of storage  never thought id see any of this stuff again   hey  what   just dont okay   excuse me guys  so mr president  how long before the new quorum of twelve  can be sworn in   three days  i will personally place your name  in nomination as my vice president  once they confirm you i submit my resignation  and you get sworn in  the whole thing should take less than an hour  youre stepping down without a fight  means tom zarek wants something  so why dont you put your cards on the table  and lets see if its a price im willing to pay  well im a realist  i never had any illusions about  remaining in office for very long  and the admirals made it quite clear  that hed like nothing better than to put me in a cell  if i tried to hang on to power  hes trying to do you a favor  you and i both know how impossible it would be  to govern this fleet without the backing of the military  i agree  thats why were here  even so i want to be included  in the new government  i dont wanna be on the outside  looking in anymore  okay  okay  you stood up to baltar on new caprica  you nearly lost your life for your trouble  this fleet needs that kind of courage  the vice presidency is yours  if you want it tom  well thank you  youre welcome  you gotta be kidding me   who gave this man permission to enter the cic   admirals orders sir  communications took some serious hits during the rescue  and mr gaetas offered to help with the repairs  well isnt that nice   man can turn his coat  collaborate with the enemy  contribute to the deaths of thousands  but when the old man needs his phones fixed and suddenly all is forgiven  if the cylons find us were gonna need every hand weve got  the cylons found us mr agathon  your friend gaeta was on the welcoming committee  hey look at me   long as youre here maybe you can help me out  im missing something  i lost it in detention  since youre so buddybuddy with the cylons  maybe you know where it is  how bout it  do you know where my eye is   saul   admiral  back to work   walk with me  yeah  we have a lot of work  in the next couple of weeks i need you to get some sleep  get rested and get ready all right  im ready right now  i may be a little rough around the edges but i can still hold my own  and you can tell that toasterlover over there  that i am still the xo of this ship    lets go  get your hands off me  youre embarrassing yourself saul  no youre the one that should be embarrassed  letting one of baltars henchman walk around  like nothings happened  go sleep this off thats an order  oh yeah just go to sleep   forget about it all just forget about everything  well im not forgetting  and im not gonna forget   the charges are   carrying arms for the enemy in a time of war  shooting three civilians and collaboration with the enemy  i call the vote  guilty  guilty   guilty  guilty  yeah guilty  guilty  the vote being unanimous the sentence is death  chadwicks aboard the monarch  ill contact our men there theyll take care of it  anybody got a cigarette    how many more of these we got   57  three days i cant believe  thats all the time weve got  then stop wasting it bitching and moaning  we all knew there was a clock when we signed on  most of these fraks are so guilty they stink  i could get through  you think were a bunch of thugs  handing out punishment on a whim   jammer didnt get airlocked  because you thought he was guilty  there was evidence  youve read the witness reports  he was tried and convicted by this circle  this is about justice you got that    justice   yeah okay okay  now dont get me wrong here  i like you connor youre a good guy  next case  felix gata  charges are  collaborating with the enemy  and crimes against humanity  well i dont want to do this   do you think i like it   i stood beside gaeta in the cic for  almost four years he was like family  but the fact remains he was the chief of staff  of gaius baltar and that alone is enough to convict him  and im saying that on this particular guy  we do not have any hard evidence  we got no witnesses nothing  all we do know is that he worked for baltar   thats it  yeah yeah  i gotta go with sam on this one  we need something specific  you want specific   you think baltar ran things   that guy  he was the public face but gaeta he was the brains  everyone knew that  he ran the operation he did the paperwork   he approved the death lists  how do you know that   were you there  did you see him approve one single death list   he knew cally was on a death list   what are you talking about how do you know that   look there  thats a distribution list  theres callys name and theres gaetas name  he saw her execution ordered  its still all circumstantial  we dont know what gaeta did  or didnt do when he saw that list  i gotta go with them on this one   jeanne   no its him   you see a death list like that you know innocent people  are gonna die and you do nothing about it  youre guilty  i call the question  the question of the innocence  or guilt of felix gaeta has been called  circle will vote  i vote guilty  guilty  guilty  guilty  sam   no dont bother im done  were still voting  im not im done im done with this whole thing  wars over for me im sorry  okay thats fine  still four to none chief whats your vote   no wait a minute we need six votes  no screw that  no screw you were a jury  thats how it was set up  we need six votes  if we dont have six votes im out too  hes right we need a sixth  how are you gaius   im alive  i suppose thats something  thank you  youll have to excuse me im slightly confused  how long have i been here exactly   three days  three days   so its taken you three days to remember where i was   no ones forgotten you gaius  its just theres been some controversy about whether or not you shouldve let on board or not  i cant believe theres still question of my value  itll always be in question  you are a human  now look  i helped you  i gave you sharons child  yes thats right you did  and the childs rescue  did weigh in your favor  however the votes deadlocked  three in favor of your being allowed to stay three against  with one model still undecided  the fact is  the decision rests with the sixes  were starting to see a rash of missing persons reports  well we left out some people on that planet  no this is different these are people known to have survived  but whove gone missing since the exodus jammer for instance  deck hand i saw him yesterday afternoon  yeah but he didnt report at muster this morning  bedcheck negative sickbay negative  its like he just vanished  how many people are missing     every one of them confirmed as a survivor  by multiple witnesses and then poof gone  keep me posted on anymore missing persons  i wanna know about it  yes sir now if youll excuse me  i have a date with a jump rope  hey ive dropped half a stone  keep jumping  hey  how ya doing   well you know im making do how are you   im good why do you ask   well i heard about your situation you were  great im just trying not to think about it anymore  you know   kinda unlike you  sitting in your plushy little office on colonial one  doing all of baltars dirty work for him  probably never even thought  about what was happening to me right   i didnt know about your situation  if i had i wouldve tried to get you out  like i just said about 50 times now  i was serving the legal president of the colonies  we all elected him remember   so thats supposed to excuse it   what do you want me to say   maybe i couldve done more but  i thought that when the cylons landed  it was important for me to keep my job  to help from the inside  by propping baltar up and letting the cylons walk all over us  no  no i fed information to the resistance  i set up deaddrops there was a dog bowl  i passed along cylon positions internal memoranda  hooray felix  youre a frakkin hero   whatever feelings i had for you have to stop  i allowed my feelings to cloud my judgment  i protected you  i gave your species a second chance  i even turned against a sister cylon and for what   im cylon gaius  somehow i lost sight of that  you are much much more than a machine  youre a person  a real person  a woman  and youre in love with me  and it hurts  i know it hurts  but believe me i am the only one that can make it better  dont you see   i am the only one  well this has to end  you need me  you need me  admit it   admit it you need me   and i need you too   did you hear me  i need you too  maybe i shouldve started with that  its a jury i wanna make that clear  its not about settling scores or personal grudges   its a jury  were just dealing with the worst of the worst  people that did more than put on an ncp uniform  or make a deal with the cylons  theyre the killers the real traitors  yeah but none of this is legal right   no no its legal  you gotta be kidding me  thats why we need to know  right now are you in or out    in  good  weve already been through the evidence so just take your time  you telling me that gaeta  saw this list and didnt do a damn thing about it   we have no idea of knowing what gaeta did  or did not do when he saw the list  my gods the whole things like a bad dream  only we woke up and the traitors are all still here  guilty  thats five to none in favor of guilty  its gotta be unanimous  chief  youre the last to vote  get outta here sam  id like to talk to my wife  id like to do it now  we already have your vote take a break  i quit because im not looking for ways  to keep killing people    i need this sam  so what   throwing a few people out of airlock  is gonna make you feel better about yourself   cause believe me those arent the people  that kept you locked in that room   theyll do  and not just for me but for every person  we left back on that planet because someone has gotta pay  so you can either get with it or you can get lost  is that what you want kara  you want me to leave   he doesnt wanna say hes guilty because gaeta  is such a good guy  right chief  everyone likes gaeta so lets let him off the hook  lets just look the other way on this one  well a lot of good people had to pay  the price for what they did  choices they made on new caprica  like my wife  thats right ellen collaborated  gave the cylons information on the resistance  and she died for it  because thats the price of collaborating with the enemy  and i liked her a lot more than i like gaeta  look sam  im in a different place now  i i  i dont know how else to explain it to you  but i got out of that cell and its like someone  painted the world in different colors  and i look at you  and i wanna tear your eyes out just for looking at me  i just wanna hurt someone and it might as well be you  so you should probably go before that happens  baltar signed death warrants organized murder squads  he collaborated with the enemy from day one  baltar not gaeta  its the same godsdamned thing  hes right  a lot of people died because of them chief  fine  guilty  remember this   i dont want this anymore  sam  take him  turn around   on your knees  on your knees   felix gata  youve been tried and found guilty  of crimes against humanity by a circle of your peers  authorized by the president of the colonies  if you have any words to offer in your own defense now is the time  come on felix talk well listen  thats right  well listen to you tell us how  hiding behind baltars skirt was actually your way  of helping the insurgency  say something  whats the point   i already tried to explain it  im not gonna beg  too bad you didnt grow that spine 4 months ago   beg  beg  beg    thrace   no   beg   come on felix tell em how  you were actually working for the resistance the entire time  come on   tell em all about the important information that you were giving up  tell em about all the messages and the dog bowl and everything else   what   and everything just tell em  whatd she say  what did she just say   back up lady   what did she just say  what did you say to her   tell me what did you say to her   there was a yellow dog bowl it was a signal  it meant there was a message in the garbage dump  i had to turn it over it was a signal there was a message in the garbage dump  oh that was you  oh my gods   what are you doing   chief   there was a yellow dog bowl  i used it  you were wondering who the source was colonel  theres no other way he couldve known  hes the only other one that would know about it  hes the reason we know about the death lists  hes the reason i saved cally  hes the reason were on this ship  hes the one who gave us the inside information  theres our source colonel  i did what i could  i dont know what else i couldve done  what the hell is this   its all perfectly legal  youll find a signed executive order on file authorizing  a secret jury of six men and women  to try sentence and execute people guilty  of extraordinary crimes  while collaborating with the enemy in a time of war  theres also a death warrant with my signature  for every conviction  your presidency is a farce  and it stops right now  if theyre guiltytheyll be tried by a jury of their peers  they have a jury but they dont get lawyers  they dont get to showboat  for weeks and months on end  they dont get to blame the system  and they dont get lasting fame as martyrs  or innocent people just in the wrong place at the wrong time  they just disappear now   in the gray twilight between  the long night of the occupation and the dawn of a new era  you come into office clean without their blood on your hands  well thank you thats thats very poetic  however you have a problem mr president  everyone by law is entitled to  a trial with representation everyone  it is not an option to be discarded  at the presidents whim  you think by making the trials public  that youll find justice    yes i do  come on laura  youre not that naive  let me tell you whats gonna happen if these cases  go to trial   itll consume this fleet for months maybe years  people will be lining up to testify  against their neighbors  itll be a circus an entertainment for the mob  and youll be signing death warrants almost every day  is that how you wanna spend your next term laura   as executionerinchief   with every fiber of my being  with every fiber of my being  congratulations madame president  thank you  thank you all for once again entrusting me  with this high office of civil service  with this high office of civil service  todays a new beginning for all of us  we share a unique destiny  that our future is ours to shape  and our past cannot be forgotten  a new day requires new thinking  and while i had intended on using this occasion  as an opportunity to announce a formation  of a special prosecutors office charged  with investigating acts of collaboration with the enemy  i have decided instead that a different gesture  is called for on this the first day of my  next term as your president  we all feel the need for justice  and we all feel the need for vengeance  and telling the difference between the two  can be difficult at times  we are all victims of the cylons  and none of us can be impartial  i certainly cant  so today i am forming a commission  on truth and reconciliation to hear our stories  and record them for posterity  there will be no prosecutions  i am issuing a general pardon for every human being in this fleet  this will not be a popular move today  but i truly believe that this is the only way for us  for us to move forward in strength  in a spirit of healing and reconciliation  i thank you  for your continued patience and courage  good day  hey chief  you want a seat
