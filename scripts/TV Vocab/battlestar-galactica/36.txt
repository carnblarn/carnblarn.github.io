                previously on battlestar galactica  i cant figure it all those weeks in detention and suddenly they let me out  i want a specific place i want a specific time  for a very highlevel meeting of the insurgency leadership  and if i dont get it we pick up saul again  and this time  hell lose more than an eye  the childs life must be protected at all costs  the first cylonhuman hybrid  it truly is a miracle from god  we lost her we did the best we could  but shes dead and thats all there is to it  shes so beautiful  you understand maya that this adoption requires absolute secrecy  you have my word  theres a raptor out there every day listening for a wireless call  and its out there because the old man isnt just gonna leave us to the cylons  will make contact this frequency every 12 hours  have hope were coming for you  cylons have removed launch keys from grounded colonial ships  location unknown  best option is for saul and the people on the ground  getting their hands on the original launch keys  admirals decided to put some boots on the ground  wants to send an officer as a liaison between us  and the resistance elements on the planet to coordinate the rescue op   makes sense whats the problem  its who hes sending  this entire plan is a reckless gamble  you are risking the lives of the entire human race  you should make plans to resume the search for earth  with the pegasus and the civilian fleet  but im going back  we round up the leaders of the insurgency and we execute them publicly  we round up at random groups off the street and we execute them publicly  send a message that the gloves are coming off  the insurgency stops now or else we start  reducing the human population to a more manageable size  let them stretch their legs for a minute  all right everybody out fiveminute rest break come on move  you over here  run  run dont look back go  can i help you   here we go  thanks   sorry  thats all right it doesnt hurt  i appreciate you

gonna  calm down damnit  you gotta start thinking clearly here chief or shes dead  now weve already figured out their map coordinate system  its referred to in the list of cylon freqs you got from the last deaddrop  holy frak youre right   i can extrapolate the coordinates  callys group has to pick up  a bunch of people in town first thatll take time  take four men and get out there ahead of the trucks  chief  pull it together you wont do her any good if you get caught too  besides  the last thing your son wants is me and ellen for parents  find that list chief where the frak is it  come on  damnit gods damnit wheres that frakkin list  its gotta be here  frak come on  here it is okay xray seven 1 4 3  hey chief  good day for a walk huh  get your men together were going to pergamus flats

galactica  dont worry about it gaius  its all right   it doesnt matter to me really  you can stop that right now okay  my egos not so fragile as all that  these things happen  or they dont happen  so what should we talk about  should we talk about your day  how was your day darling  how was your day at the office  my office  any news  no  well let me tell you about my day because  it was a hoot  i had the most fascinating chat with one of the dorals  hes got this theory  about sanitation being the key  to regaining human trust and confidence  something about  toilet paper  no lack of toilet paper thats it  if people could only wipe their bums properly  thered be a measurable uptick in the polls  four months of this gaius  four months of watching you slip further and further down into this  well of selfhatred and loathing  do you know what ive given up for you  do you  do you know what with the occupation and everything  i cant really say ive given it that much thought recently  dont go  please  that doesnt look so bad  theres something that i wanted to say to you  im sorry that i left you alone  i didnt mean for you to get hurt  i was upset with myself  and not you okay  grownups  do stupid things sometimes  we get caught up in our  own little world until its almost too late  you have no idea what im saying to you do you  okay time to take a nap  dont be afraid i know who you are what you are  poor thing  you must be terrified  do you have any candy  candy  no  chamallas so bitter  zeus sees all  sees you number three sees your pain  your destiny  all the gods weep for you  there is no zeus  no other god but god  well you dont believe that anymore  you dont know what you believe and that is why youre here  its not true  i dont even know why im here   thats the stupidest thing i ever did  it is your dream  that brings you to me  how do you know about that  i have a message for you from the one you worship  he speaks through me to you  just as he speaks in your dreams the message is  the fruit born of two peoples  is alive  a child named after  the wife and sister of the allknowing zeus  hera lives  thats not true  the child is dead  you will hold her in your arms  and youll know for the first time  what it is to feel true love  but youll lose everything youve done here  wish i had some chocolate caramels  lets move we got some people waiting for their ride down there  will you quit looking at me like that  like what  you know like what  like were never gonna see each other again  we will its a good plan d  take care of the admiral  take care of his son  all right people you know how this works  pegasus crew on the port side of the line galactica on the right  their enemies will divide them  their colonies broken in the fiery chasm of space  their shining days renounced by a multitude of dark sacrifices  yet still they will remain  always together  always together  thats the third time youve taken a look at your watch  got dinner plans  no i was just  i was just thinking sharons probably on the ground by now  i know  these are your orders  youll find the rendezvous point there  take the civilian fleet  and wait for me for 18 hours  if im not back in 18 hours  then find earth  yeah right  ill see you at the rendezvous point    try not to be late  im getting old  im a little slow but ill be there  gods i wish i could talk you out of this  you cant you tried   you know dad  dont  dont make me cry in my own hangar deck  ill see you there  permission to leave your ship admiral  permission granted commander  attention  commander of pegasus  departing   hey hey  hey jake  yeah you dont care who i am do ya  all gods creatures in your eyes  here ya go  cant sleep  bad dreams  didnt know you people had dreams  sure  everybody dreams doc  that human or cylon blood  cylon  one of the fives got pretty shot up today by the insurgents  hes gonna make it  you couldve let him suffer  thats not what i do  what about the baby  sharons baby hera  when that child died on galactica  whyd you cremate the body  its the first cylonhuman hybrid  and you threw it in the incinerator  it wasnt my decision  that was the presidents call  i was just following orders  thats a very funny thing  cause this stuff all looks the same  she said  i hope it hurts you for a long long time before you go to download city  and then they just left me there  they left me in the hot sun  with a bullet in my guts  what a noble race you are  how long were you there before you died  hours  eventually i managed to drag myself over to some spent shell casings  and i used one of those to scratch open my carotid artery  skin is a lot tougher than you think  now thats  three for me  three downloads  the first one i just got a headache  but i could handle it now its worse and worse  this time it was like a frakkin white hot poker through my skull  not worth it  none of this is worth it  hes right you know  its not worth it  which is what i believe ive been telling you all along   caprica can you please control him  why dont you just shoot me  if thatll remedy the situation   we need to crack down harder  how  our resources are stretched to the max already  i dont need to listen to this anymore  consensus used to be so easy now look what theyve done to us  dont lose hope  worst comes to worst we can always nuke the city and be done with it  better leave those dog tags here  they spot em theyll know who you are  no you have no idea how hard i worked for these  so our best guess puts the launch keys somewhere in the detention center  just keep to the main streets  everybodyll think youre just a regular skinjob and theyll avoid you but  theres a lot of people out there looking to gut an unwary cylon going  for a stroll so dont let anybody get close enough to stick a knife in you  all right thanks for the concern it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside  how are you gonna find those launch keys  when i get inside and hook into the data stream itll feed me the location  once i get the keys you need to distribute them to the pilots   who can fly those ships out of here  we got pilots standing by  anders  yeah come in  my gods whats she doing here  get her down below and keep her there until after the next briefing  wait a minute  no no wait listen to me please   i can explain  i suggest you keep your mouth shut  where is my husband i want to speak to my husband  connor lets go get her down  okay im outta here   wait sharon  yeah  do me a favor just keep an eye out for starbuck  i dont know if shes alive or if shes dead but  its been four months  ill do what i can  yeah  you must keep the child hidden at all costs  we keep her on the move  along with other highvalue targets  shell never stay in any one location longer than two or three days  sam i need you to really hear me on this  really  there is no one no one  of higher value than maya and her child  we cannot let them fall into cylon hands  i get it  how far do you want me to go  i mean if it looks like the cylons are gonna capture them  dont let it get to that point thats all  i dont suppose youre gonna tell me what this is all about  whats so important about this kid  she may very well be the shape of things to come  thats either a blessing or a curse  weve stored arms and munitions in key areas through the city  i can supplement that with mortars rpgs  even a few antiaircraft missiles aboard the raptor  great  when we give the signal our people are gonna attack the airbase  the detention center the power station other critical facilities  the plan is to sow as much chaos and confusion  as possible the moment galactica and pegasus arrive   should help cover the evacuation  no pegasus  just galactica  why why no pegasus   what happened  dont know sir  way beyond my pay grade  what about your evac plans  weve designated and assigned 500 block captains  to cover each sector of the city  each block captain is responsible for rallying  and guiding the people in his or her sector  along their escape route to their designated ship  dont suppose youve been able to rehearse any of this  weve had three fulldress rehearsals under the guise  of fire and natural disaster drills  be different when the balloon goes up  explosions shooting chaos  theres gonna be some panic out there  theyll do fine these people know that at some point  theyre gonna be responsible for saving themselves  all we need to do is be ready and hope for the best   what about maya and isis  im on it  ive got my two best shooters here  theyre gonna be their escorts and make sure they get back to the ship  gentlemen i cant tell you why but it is imperative  that this woman and her child   get off this planet  i trust you because i trust him  yes maam  saul  we need to talk  toaster   she sold us out  what are you talking about  we were ambushed at the rendezvous  the cylons knew exactly where we were gonna be  it doesnt mean ellen had  this is the map colonel the map that i drew for you  i gave this to you in your tent  you were gonna burn it but then your wife offered to do it for you  i got it off a dead skinjob at the ambush do the math  i  i want to explain saul   godsdamn traitor  shut your frakkin mouth  he said  he said hed kill you   who said it  one of the brother cavils  i did it for you saul  it was all for you i had to  i didnt have any choice  dont you see that  drawer 378  what are you doing  oh my god its you  youre betraying your own people  for what   im a colonial officer now  youre not one of them   i gave them my word  thats not what counts  its who you give it to  im gonna have to shoot you now  hera lives  what  your daughter hera is alive  your new friends tell you that  they faked her death and they hid her from you  cant say anything on higher dreams  i had strange dreams  i was having strange dreams that made me question my faith  made me question god  and in the dreams there was a human oracle  so i went to see dodona selloi  im not gonna kill you but im gonna wound you so you cant warn the others  the oracle said that the fruit born of two peoples   is still alive  that hera lives  and i would hold her in my arms and i will know true love  put down the gun  and when i find her you can hold her too  adama wouldnt lie to me  youre wrong  youre wrong  launch keys dont seem to have been damaged  from all the data points  it looks like the ships all have enough tylium to make at least one jump  congratulations by the way  i heard its a boy  whats his name  nicolas after callys grandfather  hey chief  you remember when you helped helo spread heras ashes  you actually saw the ashes  yeah of course why  nothing  just make sure cally never lets her kid out of her sight  sir  listening raptor just jumped back  sharons got the launch keys  rec room racetrack  very well sir  its on  this is the admiral  youve heard the news  you know the mission  you should also know theres only one way that this mission ends  and thats with the successful rescue  of our people  off of new caprica  look around you  take a good look at the men and women  that stand next to you  remember their faces  for one day you will tell your children  and your grandchildren  that you served with such men and women  as the universe has never seen  and together  you accomplished a feat  that will be told and retold  down through the ages  and find immortality  as only the gods once knew  im proud to serve with you  good hunting  begin jump prep  action stations  set condition one throughout the ship  standby for a combat jump  we thank you for watching battlestar galactica with our subs     lords of kobol
