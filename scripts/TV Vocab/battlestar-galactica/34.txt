gonna be fun  congratulations commander  the pegasus is your command  i am picking up a large planetary body  its habitable  we may have just found a world that can support human life  i know in my gut that settling on this planets gonna mean disaster for humanity  and i will not say otherwise just to win an election  i take the office of president of the twelve colonies of kobol and  im going to sign my first executive order  requiring to immediately establish settlements on the planet we have come to know  as new caprica  if you want to move down there go ahead be my guest  go down and cat around with all the men  saul i want you  at last a safe haven we can call home  oh my gods  its a cylon fleet they found us  we have to get out of here sir  we cant just leave all those people

cylons just jumped into orbit  and the fleets jumped away theyve left us  on behalf of the people of the twelve colonies  i surrender  im looking for kara thrace   projetsg prsente   saison 3  episode 01 occupation  edition harkot niko   relecture niko  h  ht  htt                    do you know  that every time they take you out of this cell  we come in here and we change those little hash marks on your little calendar there youre trying to hide  potatoes gravy  even some carrots  heavenly father we thank you for the bounty of this table  yes  yes  come on dont stop  come on  come on  you son of a bitch son of a bitch  yet  ahh baby ahh  oh boy  all right were armed  theyre inbound lets move  i need a knife  thank you  youre welcome  i must say i quite enjoyed that  im so glad  and uh  when

take an hour or so bureaucracy must be served  but if youre lucky youll get home by dinner time  colonel  come on  im not gonna hold this door open forever  attention new capricans affective immediately potable water  saul  gods gods  what did they do to you  its all right im out thats all that matters  lets get out of here  okay  okay ready  now  oh for deaths sakes  come on come on is that thing gonna work or what  worked that time  go go go  frakin insurgents  you look  so lovely tonight  ill see you soon kara  take your time  occupation of new caprica  today is mars day  somehow it seems appropriate to honor the god of war on a day when it feels like perpetual war is the only realistic prospect for us  weve had no contact with galactica since it left four months ago  but i refuse to believe that adama has abandoned us  our insurgency has been striking back against the cylons whenever and wherever possible  although at times these attacks seem like futile gestures i believe that they are critical to moral  to maintaining some measure of hope  but in order for the insurgency to have a more meaningful impact we need to strike a high profile target  it is simply not enough to kill cylons because they dont die  they resurrect themselves and they continue to walk among us  it is horrifying  the cylon occupation authority  continues to exert complete control over the city and we remain at their mercy  the colonial government under president gaius baltar functions in name only  lets review why were here shall we  were supposed to bring the word of god to the people right  to save humanity from damnation by bringing the love of god to these poor benighted people  were here because a majority of the cylon felt that the slaughter of mankind had been a mistake  were here to find a new way to live in peace as god wants us to live  and its been a fun ride so far but i want to clarify our objectives  if were bringing the word of god then it follows that we should employ any means necessary to do so any means  yes fear is a key article of faith as i understand it  so perhaps its time to instill a little more fear into the peoples hearts and minds  lets uh  lets execute baltar  what what  thats not gonna happen  just because hes your favorite toy shouldnt be allowed to interfere with the larger issues here   i think that i have cooperated  gaius is with me  anyone who wants to challenge that will have to deal with me  well it doesnt matter  if wed killed him at the beginning it might have worked  but now most humans think of him as a traitor and would actually cheer his death  fine fine we dont kill baltar  we round up the leaders of the insurgency and we execute them publicly  we round up at random groups off the street and we execute them publicly  send a message that the gloves are coming off  the insurgency stops now or else we start reducing the human population to a more manageable size  i dont know say uh less than a 1000  we need to stop being butchers  the entire point of coming here was to start a new way of life  to push past the conflict thats separated us from humans for so long  and what has it gotten us its not like they welcomed us with with  frak it never mind  youre all living in a fantasy world  consider the irony in that delusional machines  whats the universe gonna come up with next  is it really worth it caprica  is the love of that man really worth possibly losing all of this  if you ever experienced love you wouldnt have to ask  in recent months the cylons have been recruiting and training humans in an attempt to establish a human police force  it is hard to think of anything more despicable than humans doing the dirty work of the cylons  led to believe they were merely taking the civilian security out of the hands of the cylons  and members of the human police have since become an extension of the cylons corporeal authority  and while their names are kept deeply confidential there is no question  some of them are people we might least expect  hundreds of us have been rounded up by the cylons held in detention questioned tortured  others have simply vanished  in recent weeks weve been gaining access to some very important documents from a source within baltars administration  no one knows who this mysterious benefactor is  but he communicates with the insurgents by means of a secret signal  we pray every day for the men and women who risk their lives to fight the cylons they have everything to lose  and such little hope of something to gain  hey jake  here we go  looks like mommys gonna get some sleep tonight after all  sometimes i hate everything about this place  sometimes its  its magic  i gotta go  ill be back in a couple hours  one of these days youre just not gonna come back are you  youll just vanish and thatll be it  ill never see you again  nick will never know his father  couple hours i promise   good to see you colonel  its good to be seen  i know youre wondering so ill save you the trouble  the eye is gone  ripped it right out onto the floor picked it up and showed it to me  looked like a hardboiled egg  big boom today   hope that was you two  oh yeah heavy raider too  good men whats our next target  well i got these today  theyre security plans for the graduation ceremony at the new caprica police academy  these are right out of the ministry files where are you getting this stuff whos your source  i have no idea source wont tell me what their name is its probably safer for all of us  weve been getting stuff like this for weeks  humans working for the cylons makes you wanna puke  yeah well all the top occupation brass is gonna be at the graduation even president baltar   gaius baltar  yes sir  i think we can get a shot at him too the problem is its gonna be tough avoiding human casualties  dont avoid them send a message  you work with the cylons youre a target  no boundaries for the cylons theres no boundaries for us  anything we can do to nail that son of a bitch gaius baltar is worth doing   where are we on the wireless  uh nowhere  every day we try and contact the raptor and every day the cylons jam the transmission  ive asked to the inside source to tell us which of the cylon jamming frequencies are the weakest but so far i got nothing  you guys are dreaming theres no raptor there okay  there hasnt been one for the past four months either  galacticas not coming back  theyre not accept it  watch your frakkin mouth  theres a raptor out there every day listening for a wireless call  its out there because that was the plan if anything happened  and its out there because the old man isnt just gonna leave us to the cylons  the old man left me to the cylons colonel  and if it wasnt for my wife being a royal pain in the ass and refusing to let it go i would be dead a year now  any word on kara  nothing in four months  hi honey im home  you kill me i download  i come back we start over  five times now  im trying to help you kara  i only want you to see the truth of your life  the reason why you suffered and you struggled for so long  thats why god sent me to you thats why god wants us to be together   all right  youre right   youre right  good   and i hear you i do  good   so thank you  youre welcome  thank you for putting up with me  im so sorry  put it down kara  just put it down   im a patient man  youre not a man  and im willing to wait you just need more time  i dont need more frakkin time its never gonna happen  of course its gonna happen youre gonna hold me in your arms  youre gonna embrace me youre gonna tell me that you love me  ive seen it  youre insane  to know the face of god is to know madness  im going to bed  be nice if you joined me  either way youll be spending the night with me  i do love you kara thrace  good night  let me out  let me out of here  i dont belong here let me out  let me out   boomtrack adjust yourself a rolling 20 degrees  snowbird 3 get information  okay snowbirds lets nail this exercise  how many times do we are gonna run this thing  what youre not having fun yet  come on focus snowbirds  snowbirds galactica regroup into deployment formation and proceed to position one  snowbird one to snowbirds drop point in eight seconds  okay snowbirds lets get this deployment bang on the admirals watching every move  roger kat  we go on your command  bomb bay doors open  all vipers break now now now  deploy drones on my mark  three two one  mark  frak me  gods damn it snowbird four what the hell happened can the chatter snowbirds  this is the cag abort maneuver  i say again decoy squadron abort maneuver  roger that leader snowbirds fall back abort drill await further instructions  hey get off my wings  galactica kat it is a mess out there we got decoy drones heading every which way request instructions  roger that kat abort acknowledged  youre approaching bingo fuel anyway bring your birds back home  belay that  strike my last stand by  launch a tanker bird let them practice their inflight refueling before they recover the drones  have them run the exercise one more time  yes sir   the next one will be 17 wont it  yes sir  launch the tanker  all units galactica  recover drones and prepare to run training mission again were launching the tanker bird  tanker  once youve tanked up head back to position alpha and prepare for training run 17 galactica out  what the frak are they doing over there  this is the commander get the admiral on the line  admiral considering how long our pilots have been in the air i suggest we recall the birds and scrub the training exercise  if we cant do this in a training scenario how the hell are we supposed to pull this off with cylon raiders on our asses  tell me  what the frak do you want from me  i dont know how were supposed to do any of this crap at halfstrength  collision weve had a collision   give me your status kat  bingo molar speak to me  im losing flight control i got red lights all across the board  kat im in a lateral spin and losing hydraulics my wings clipped  galactica kat im declaring an emergency requesting priority landing for two bent birds   pull them in  yes sir  roger that kat bring your birds back home  this whole thing is frakking insane we got two ships at halfstrength  we got crews that havent seen action in a year and a half  and youre acting like the only problem is theyre not working hard enough  have you taken a look at yourself in the mirror lately  youre weak soft  mentally and physically  this isnt about me  youve had four months to get your act together  and so far all youve been able to frakkin do is to complain and whine about how hard it is  well guess what  its gonna get a lot harder do you understand me  now i want you to turn around and get your fat ass out of here  get your men ready or ill find someone who can  dismissed  i dont like this one colonel  i think were the ones crossing the line here  its the only way its gonna work kids got access and clearance  you gotta be square on this you cant back out once you start  im not backing out  its wrong colonel you know that dont you  hes a soldier chief not the first time weve sent a soldier on a oneway mission you know that dont you   this is different  this is our best chance to take out gaius baltar  maybe the only one were sure as frak gonna take it  every since they killed nora  i got nothing to live for  all right  you look me in the eye and you tell me that you are committed to this  im committed  all right  may the gods be with you  some things you just dont do colonel not even in war  well maybe youll feel different when youre sitting in detention  duck volunteered hes going  its a hard thing to say but it seems like i dont know who my son is anymore  same goes for the crew of the ship  i feel pretty much alone  except maybe for you  i wish i could go back a year and tell that admiral adama about this conversation  a years a long time  can i ask you something very personal  do you feel guilty about leaving the people behind on new caprica  i dont do guilt  you know a year ago  when you put me in the cell i was at a crossroads  i sat in here for weeks just consumed with rage at all the things that had happened to me  and at some point i realized it was all just guilt  i was angry at myself for the choices i had made  betraying my people  and losing the baby  so i had a choice  i could either move forward or stay in the past  but the only way to move forward  was to forgive myself  you know i dont think we can survive  i dont think the fleet or galactica or the people on new caprica can survive  unless the man at the top finds a way to forgive himself  two of our pilots almost got killed because theyve been in the cockpit for 11 hours  and he wants to bust my balls  youre soft can you believe that  what  oh you agree is that it  forget it im not looking for a fight  oh no no no no dont do that  you got something to say come out and say it  hes right you are soft  im not talking about the weight  youve lost your edge  your confidence  you lost your war lee  and the truth is youre a soldier who needs a war  and you dont wanna hear it because youve got it in your head that your fathers the soldier  and you sure dont wanna be like him but you are like him  youre more like him than you know  thats one of the reasons i married you  okay its working i think  is it working or isnt it  they keep jamming us  so much for our source on the inside  ten minutes left  and lots of nothing on the wireless as usual  keep an eye out for raiders  last listening bird almost got popped by a pair yesterday  i almost got it  ow frak turn that thing down  its working  its working  times up spin up the ftl and get ready to go  hold on  im picking something up  its a colonial transmission its a low power signal but the recognition codes match  oh yeah we got a link to the ground  okay send the coded response spin up the drive and lets get the hell back to galactica  ive got a signal a raptor just made contact with us  whats it say  we will make contact this frequency every 12 hours  prepare sitrep for command authority  have hope were coming for you  we made contact i say again we made contact with the ground  colonel tigh has formed an insurgent group against the cylons  and now theyre ready and waiting for instructions on how to coordinate the rescue effort  its gonna be okay  its really gonna be okay  these are all the surveillance pictures taken by the insurgents  i think we can match names to about 50 of these photos  but our best guess puts the total police force at around 200   i wouldnt have believed thered be 20 people who would turn against their own kind  i want those names i want the rest of the names  thats tough the cylons are afraid the population will go after any human who joins the new caprica police  as well they should  i  i know i havent lived a model life  i made a lot of mistakes  but im gonna need your protection today  mr president  morning gaeta  its time for the graduation ceremony  oh yes  the ceremony  about the ceremony theres a been a change of plan  i wont be going  security concern  dont look so worried  therell be other graduations  right okay ill just  let the staff know  i think we should call off the strike  theres no reason to go forward with it if the galacticas gonna come back  what and pass up a golden opportunity to kill gaius baltar  other than that colonel i fail to see the point  think with your head chief not with your heart  the only way they stand a chance of getting us off this rock is if the cylons are too distracted battling a fullblown uprising when they get here  all right if your source on the inside says baltars not gonna be there abort  otherwise stick with the plan  hey duck  good morning  and welcome to all graduates  you are the hope  you are the dream of a new tomorrow for humans and cylon alike  and i salute you for the risks that you have taken for just showing up today  today you begin a new career and a new life as provisional police officers  and looking out across this room i see that the significance of this new path is not lost on you  congratulations its good to have you with us  congratulations sergeant meet you is a pleasure  congratulations captain its great to have you with us  ill see you soon nora
