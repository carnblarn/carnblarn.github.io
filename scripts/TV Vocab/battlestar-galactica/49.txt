father was a priest my mother was an oracle  ive served on battlestar since i was 18 years old  when you elected me union president  i promised i would keep us working  you must throw your body on the gears and on the levers  and on the machine itself and make it stop  strike strike  youre pretending like nothings changed  that our lives are exactly like they were before we went to new caprica  but it is different  were just goin through a rough patch  what if rough patches are all we have left  figurski pollux sanchez  youll be rehabbing mule engines tonight so dont make afterdinner plans  set

well  yeah well it turns out im in a critical position  and my leaving would cause  severe mission degradation   that sucks  critical position my ass  they just dont want knuckle draggers stinking up the pilot ready room  all right thats enough lock it up thats enough  the cag told me you got bounced from flight training  im sorry about that it sucks  truth is we need you down here youre the best avionics specialist we got  and she knows how to fold a mans undies  enough enough get off him  hey shut up figurski  ill pop you in the mouth myself now get back to work   come here  let go of me  listen to me  look  you do important work down here  just as important as sitting in a cockpit  thanks chief  im gonna deliver some more important laundry  raptor away  readings nominal  everything looks good  setting course heading twoninersixfive  what the frak  flameout rcs thrusters jammed  restart  no go  galactica skulls engine two thrusters stuck in full position  engine one wont start  theres a fire in engine two  its gonna blow get your ass up here  eject eject  battlestar galactica season 3  episode 16   dirty hands   we got off lucky a dozen injuries   no fatalities  thank you  you shouldve seen torys shoulder  i had to help cottle put it back into alignment  you know i am so busy i hardly ever make it down to this end of the ship  and now im gonna be living here for god knows how long  until they repair the bulkheads  well if the quarters become cramped  youre always welcome in one of my beds  in a manner of speaking  do you have any better idea what happened to your raptor  were still investigating the situation  but it seems that the tylium was  seriously contaminated with impurities  most likely its a problem with the refining process  whats going on there the refinery was the most reliable ship in the fleet  now every day i start with a stack of messages  from their chief what is his name   xeno fenner  fenner  complaing about working conditions and  deliveries and  spare parts and compensation  if you can believe that were on the run for our lives  and the guy wants to talk about overtime bonuses  well weve been more than patient with fenner and his  production problems  two weeks of sitting here waiting for him to get his act together  i dont know about you  but im ready to get back on the road to finding earth  is that a hint of hope i hear  has the skeptic suddenly decided that were on the road to earth after all  have i ever doubted it  ive got people working  how long you think a man can keep that up  if the cylons show up we have enough fuel  to jump the entire fleet what once  maybe twice  thats a margin thats much too narrow for me  how about for you and your men  you have a problem fix it  just get the gas flowing  and then well talk i promise you that  then well talk  its always later  you know  its funny that when the gas flows  my phone calls dont get returned  but the minute theres a glitch in the fuel supply  ive got face time with the president and the admiral  maybe we should just start having more glitches  is that a threat  its like the book says  if you hear the people youll never have to fear the people  did you say the book  guards arrest him  for extortion and interrupting vital services  during a time of war  go ahead take him away thats it go out of here gone  come with me sir   what the hell was that  he was quoting from baltars book  the ramblings that his lawyer smuggled out of the brig  hes having it reprinted and passed out among the fleet  and hes calling it my triumphs my mistakes by gaius baltar  i am thinking of having a good oldfashioned bookburning  hows the meat loaf starting to be a favorite  its not for you  remember our little talk  but todays my cheat day  the last three days have been your cheat day  really  you were moving better yesterday  is that how the bends are supposed to work  im just upset about seelix  so im tensing up  they should have just told her right off the bat what the fleet priorities are  should have said that  they needed knuckle draggers more than they need pilots  it isnt about fleet priorities  were not part of the ruling class so were stuck doing the dirty work  the ruling class whered you get that  something i read  by baltar  those frakking rags making their way around the fleet  i cant believe that anybodys reading anything written by that guy  thats what i thought too but  do you ever wonder why all the pilots  and the officers come from the rich colonies like  caprica and virgon tauron  while all the knuckle draggers come from the poor colonies like  like aerelon and sagittaron and geminon  yeah thats just trash talk on the deck  really  name one officer on the fleet that comes from a poor colony  dualla lieutenant duallas from sagittaron  case in point  how did she get promoted  she married an officer  from caprica  tyrol  chief the foreman of the fuel refinery has just been arrested  xeno fenner   do you know him  did something happen to xeno  arrested  yes sir he was in the union on new caprica  hes a good guy whatd he do  he pissed off the president  but the bigger problem right now is the refing operation  i need someone to go over there and get that fuel ship moving again  pick a team get your gear and be on the hangar deck in an hour  yes sir  i dont understand what happened to xeno  he pissed off the president  what you can get arrested for that now  i think the admiral was kidding  yeah   you ever think about the union  sure but thats gone now  new capricas gone but all the people in the union are still here  the only difference is now they dont have anyone to stand up for them  i gotta go  i do hope youre enjoying yourselves  not enough that you have to interrupt my sleep and put filth in my food  now you have to destroy my stuff as well youre pathetic  youre utterly and totally  hello doctor  why dont you do yourself a favor  hand over the pages and stop all this nonsense  i dont know what youre talking about  turn him around  the pages to your book  my triumphs my mistakes  by gaius baltar  so youve read it  the people are reading it and now youre sorry  weve known that your lawyer was smuggling the pages out here for weeks  so we intercepted them and im afraid im the only one whos read the book  and i am dying to see how it ends  really what were you thinking now  casting yourself as a man of the people  the son of a farmer  a revolutionary  please  it may come as some surprise to you madame president  but i wish to strike a chord with the common man  hand over those pages or ill have these guards search you  make a choice  gentlemen proceed  dont bend to her gaius  show her that she cant break you  keep your dignity  perhaps youll consider writing a blurb for the back cover  thank you doctor  close cell  its all right gaius  everythingll be okay   tyrol  cabott hey  how you doin  good to see you   sorry  its inevitable  listen hey i gotta tell ya  we all started feeling a lot better when we heard they were sending you   oh yeah  you bet  ive been talking you up telling everybody how the union on new caprica   really stood up for the little guy  yeah well  youre looking at the fleets entire fuel supply of tylium  how many jumps you think we got  well be lucky if we get out of the system  well you better give us the nickel tour see where we stand  its a big operation  yeah well you should see this place when its up and running  its loud as an abomb just about as safe  listen we really need this downtime  i mean look around  next time some machine fraks up it might not just take out a raptor  this ship it really is a big bomb just waiting to go up  yeah look i understand the risk but i need to see it workin so  pull your guys off and lets lets fire it up  it aint gonna work  you work here  this is milo hes the best grease monkey i got  milo huh  tell me milo so why is it not gonna work  is there something you guys arent telling me  come on  okay  guess im just gonna have to have a look for myself  is that pressure relief  seals are missing  they all are  without pressure seals the machinery wont run   well where are they  guess they got lost huh  guys you cant be frakking around with this stuff   the admiral wont stand for it  the admiral can kiss my ass  come on chief you know what this is about  i guess when working conditions improve  they let xeno outta jail well be able to find those seals  until then this ship isnt gonna be refing another drop of tylium  and that means this fleet isnt going anywhere  ive executed a search of the ship but the seals have not turned up  you know that this is sabotage  im inclined to have them locked up  sir please they could have rigged something to have me injured  they could have contaminated the fuel on purpose and left all of our ships   dead in the air  good gods  all they did do was buy themselves some time  the machinery does need overhauling  theres a reason that the quality control is failing  you realize that most of the workers on that ship  have not had a day off since the original attack on our colonies  its like slave labor  dont be absurd  the men and women aboard that ship are stuck there  they cant leave they cant transfer they have no control over their lives  and the work is hard we know that do they think theyre having a picnic  on the algae processing plant or munitions or wasteprocessing  the fleet is filled with ships with people  working under horrific conditions and nobodys having a good time  well i think that if we at least  release xeno and start talking to them about improving  working and living conditions that the protest will go away  theyll return the pressure seals  and well get the fuel contamination problem under control  extortion is not  an acceptable method of protest what are the names of the leaders   just cabott  i will issue a warrant for his arrest  put him in the brig have him sweat it out  admiral madame president theyre just trying to  chief huhhuh were done  im gonna go check on cabott and xeno  chief  you gotta get him outta here  what the hell happened to his hands  i wake up in the night hes scratching the walls  just keeps scratching till his fingers are bleeding  they will say it doesnt matter  he was in cylon detention on new caprica you remember  he came out squirrelly and this is not helping  come on you gotta get him outta here  where are the seals   you son of a bitch  come on  come on galen you got get him outta here  cabott  cabott look at me  cabott listen to me where are the seals  i wouldnt say it doesnt matter  cabott i can get you out of here tell me where the seals are  it doesnt matter   it doesnt matter  for gods sakes get him out of here  where are the seals   where are they  it doesnt matter  look at him where are the seals  it doesnt matter   where are they  the air vent  all right theyre in the center stern air vent   tell the president to release them  frak  all right thats the last one  lets fire this up  and get back to work  yes sir whatever you say boss  can i throw the switch   how old are you  12  almost  but i can run every machine we got  only thing i havent done is turn the whole thing on  its all yours  there are kids down there madame president  theres children on every ship in the fleet  these children work in the refinery  theyre 12 15 years old  there have been families aboard the refinery ever since its beginning  and others were picked up after the cylons attacked the colonies  over the past two years  the parents have been teaching the children how to operate the machinery  they have been passing along their skills  it is perfectly normal  it is not ideal i know that  but there is nothing ideal about this fleet  do you see whats happening  the jobs are starting to be inherited madam president  we dont know how long were gonna be on these ships what if its ten years  so i train my son to be a deck hand because thats what i am  and thats all he can ever be  is that the future we want  thats a really good point  tory i want you to make a list of everyone in the fleet  who has a work history appropriate to the refinery  factory workers mechanics whatever you think  give it to the chief and i want you to hold a public lottery  and we will take people from other vessels and we will  put them on shifts in the refinery hows that chief   thank you  thank you  so thats our allotment from dogsville  get these people on these ships before they know where theyre going   all right people lets go  excuse me sir  hi  i dont really know who im supposed to talk to you about this  but i dont really think im what you guys are looking for  i dont really have the skills   whats your name  danny noon  figurski noon  noon  noon   noon daniel says youre a farmer  farmer thats what were looking for   people to work with heavy machinery  no but i dont not really i  i worked on a farm for a summer  cause i was saving up to go to college architecture but then  cylons attacked and  now im a farmer how is that fair  how is that in any way fair  scuse me a second  we make an exception for him theres gonna be 15 more right behind him   look at him though hes a kid  well  fine put him in the ship  look this is just a temporary thing okay  wait hold on i am not a farmer  yeah its not permanent  no wait can you just check my record  yeah  excuse me who am i supposed to talk to about this  who am i supposed to talk to about this  you dont understand im not a farmer  hey stop it im not a farmer  what are you doing here  your book  fact or fiction  so you read it  well that proves that the presidents an accomplished liar  she told me it hadnt gone out  so what do you make of it  i think that its a pile of crap  obviously my analysis of a bifurcated society scares you  but everything in my book happens to be true  oh its true  its true that youre a farm boy from aerelon  yes it is as a matter of fact  i was born and raised on a dairy outside the town of cuffles breath wash  on aerelon  why do i have such a hard time  picturing you  milking cows and shoveling manure  lack of imagination  or maybe that your little tale is manure  ive known people from aerelon you dont   sound anything like them  i dont sound like im from aerelon  no  well you know i take that as a particular compliment  i dont know about you but ive always found the aerelon dialect  to be particularly hard on the ears  something about the consonants that scrape the back of the throat  of course i should know an awful lot about my native tongue  i spent hours on end trying to overcome it do you have any idea how hard it is  for a tenyearold boy to change the way he speaks  to unlearn everything he ever learned  so that one day  one day there might be the small hope  that he might be considered as not coming from aerelon  maybe i dont know caprica  caprican  oh to be caprican  seat of politics culture  art science learning  and what was aerelon just a drab  ugly rock condemned to be the  food basket for the 12 worlds  and thats how we were treated like  servants like laborers like working class  you know youd have fitted right in there chief  lots of men who liked to work with their hands and  grab a pint down at the pub and  finish off the evening with a good oldfashioned fight  oh yes  i left aerelon after my 18th birthday  i turned my back on my family  on my heritage  all of them  of course it doesnt matter that theyre all dead now  you do realize that   none of that exists here  coming from the mouth of a mechanic  weve kept democracy  we have government  we have rights we have elections  well then you should feel perfectly happy shouldnt you  perfectly at ease  go home leave me in peace  after all thats what the aristocracy wants  it wants the working class to feel looked after  while they scrabble around for scraps from the masters table  a question i ask at the end of my book ill save you the trouble of reading it  do you honestly believe that the fleet  will ever be commanded by somebody whose last name is not adama  there it is chief  one set of rules for the aristocracy  and one set of rules for the rest of us  weve given assignments to all the new workers from the lottery   looks like you put em right to work  yeah yeah theyre okay  theyre a little skittish but theyll catch on  right up heres where we had the problem last time  got all kinds of gear slippage temperature variations  we didnt know the dross wasnt getting burned off   thats your bad fuel  yeah its running now  weve got half a dozen other places on the line that could frak us  whoa whats that  whoa thats it hit the switch  no no no not when its jammed the whole system will seize up  gotta find it otherwise the ore still in the chamber will superheat  and set off a chain reaction thatll blow us all to hell  hurry we gotta get this going  right here this is it   you got it  yeah  get it out of there   come on just give it a yank  i cant get my hand on it  careful careful  its too small i cant get under it  we got some hot rocks up there you gotta get this thing started fast   give it a yank give it a yank  i just cant get my hand around it  i cant get my hand on it  i can try  i can try   get in there  i can probably fit   come on danny  if he clears it  the belts gonna jump so you gotta be careful  there you go there he goes  you got it   attaboy  be careful  come on danny get it movin  thats it attaboy  now grab it pull it  pull it towards you pull hard pull hard  pull hard danny  yes all right  good work danny good work  attaboy danny get outta there come on out  medic  medic  medic now  take it easy buddy we got ya  were gonna lay you down  its okay buddy you did a great job  great job get in there get in there  youre gonna be okay  youre gonna be okay  i need more gauze just calm down  this plant is offline  were on strike   need something captain  yeah i fraking need my viper  sorry captain vital missions only  caps already up  we did our job  what do you mean vital missions only  whose orders  cally relayed the orders from chief tyrol  were on strike  admiral  are you aware that your deck gang is participating in a work stoppage   its called a general strike sir  its a mutiny  and do you know what we do with mutineers  we shoot them chief  were leaving people behind admiral  they are locked into their jobs and have no control over their lives  they have no say  were abandoning them to their fate like weve marooned them on a planet  that is not the issue  the men and women on this ship are not allowed to disobey an order  especially in support of some kind of frakking labor dispute  we launched the cap no one has abandoned their post   were not putting anyone in danger  this is mutiny  and it stops now  admiral all i want is a sit down with the president  this is the admiral  arrest cally tyrol  take her under armed guard directly to the starboard repair bay  repair bay what are you doing  im gonna put her up against the bulkhead  and im gonna shoot her as a mutineer  are you out of your frakking mind  cally was just following my orders  shes a ringleader so she goes first  and then the rest of your dead gang figurski seelix pollux  you wont do this  we have a son  understand me  the very survival of this ship may depend on someone getting an order  that they dont want to do  and if they hesitate  if they feel that orders are sometimes optional  then this ship will perish  and so will your son  and the entire human race  i dont want to do this chief  but i will put ten callys up against the wall  to make sure that this ship and this fleet  are not destroyed  fine  ill call it off  this is the admiral  do you have cally in custody  put her on open the door  you okay  dont worry about me ive been in the brig before  everythings okay   call off the strike  did they cave  yeah  call it off  i knew it okay ill take care of it  galen im proud of you  give the phone to the marine  release her  you can go now chief  i thought you had something that you wanted to discuss with the president   would you like another drink  i think ive had enough  madame president  ive seen people drafted into service based purely on where they were born  theyve also been selected based on their skills  which is a result of where they were born  capricans are more likely to be professionals  aerelons are more likely to be farmers its just a fact of life   its a fact i cant change  true  but i think we can level the playing field  there are a lot of dirty jobs that need to be done every day in this fleet  cleaning hauling lowlevel maintenance things like that  these are the kind of jobs that i think should be allocated to people who  well people like yourself no offense  none taken go ahead  let some of the people on colonial one get their hands dirty for a change  done what else  people that are in dangerous and highstress jobs  need to be rotated out for r and r  and in order to do that we need a formal training program  we can talk about a training program later but right now we need to  focus on maintaining the workforce that we have  and this is gonna have to be an area where the union gives ground  the union  im sorry i thought you were engaged in collective bargaining  on behalf of the colonial workers alliance   if thats not the case then  madame president  that union died on new caprica  chief the workers in this fleet  they need someone to represent them and their interests  and if this society is becoming truly polarized  between an entrenched political class and a disenfranchised underclass  we are doomed  we wont need the cylons to destroy us well destroy ourselves  the fleet that arrives at earth will not represent colonial society at all  i am willing to fight for that society until my dying breath  i would love it if you would fight for that society as well  i will  i will madame president i will  pollux and herschel you are on fueling 4372  chief tyrol  hey captain  one of my nuggets failed to show up for basic flight instruction this morning  sorry to hear that  so maybe you can tell me where the hell diana seelix is  seelix front and center  flight instruction began 20 minutes ago you wanna be a pilot or not  yes sir but i thought  you will think when i tell you to think nugget  and you might want to look at the plan of the day  cause then youll know where youre supposed to be  and you might actually get there on time  and youre out of uniform to boot  im sorry captain i think i can handle that   thank you chief  hold this  you have to be an officer to fly vipers  you know that  detail and salute  thank you chief  thank you  congratulations ensign  this is all very touching  but you were supposed to be in ready room four 20 minutes ago  ensign which means that you are falling behind on your first day  so move it  dont look at him move it  move it  be nice
