                narrator previously on battlestar galactica        helo what the hell is going on you killed her  we gotta go right now  billy thats tom zarek dualla the terrorist  billy hes a prisoner of conscience dualla hes a butcher  he blew up a government building there is no excuse for that  i thought you said you respected me  that was before you resorted to violence and hostagetaking  zarek i demand the immediate resignation of laura roslin and her ministers  i demand free and open elections to choose a new leadership  if you let the rest of these hostages go we will leave this ship in your hands  mcmanus got it man test there  mcmanus are we on man frack were on go  mcmanus live from cloud nine the most luxurious ship in the fleet  its the colonial gang  its a new talk show that brings you the inside scoop on the fleet  im james mcmanus formerly of the caprica times  with me are two of the only remaining legitimate journalists left  playa palacios veteran commentator for the picon star tribune welcome  and my wingman sekou hamilton former editor of the aerilon gazette  mcmanus  as most people know  cloud nine was damaged during a cylon attack  and had to be evacuated  with repairs now complete president roslin has picked it as the site  for an historic gathering  its the first meeting of the interim quorum of 12  which will coincide with colonial day  the 52nd anniversary of the signing of the articles of colonisation  playa why dont you weigh in  laura roslin should be applauded  for restoring the system of checks and balances  mcmanus every delegate chosen so far has been a roslin crony  its a puppet quorum okay  that will rubberstamp every edict this powermad schoolteacher will try  how can you say that when half the quorum hasnt even been selected  mcmanus i predict every one of them will be a roslin lackey  handpicked by the power behind the throne presidential advisor wallace gray  dont you see gray orchestrated this whole publicity stunt  come on jim wallace gray is no prince of darkness  i disagree  hes helped roslin regulate the internal economy  made sure vital food and medical supplies were fairly distributed  hes a gasbag whos made a fortune through deals quorum members have profited from  roslin freedom of the press  mcmanus as we speak  madam president the fatuous gasbag would like 5 minutes of your time  wally  roslin how does it feel to be a celebrity gray well i love it  theyll probably be calling me a fascist next  no im the fascist you stick with being the gasbag  madam president excuse me youre going to want to hear this  mcmanus  sagittaron have chosen their delegate for the interim quorum of 12  who wouldve guessed it tom zarek   oh my gods  hes got quite a following out there   i should have seen this coming  hes a terrorist who are they kidding  mcmanus  a ruthless terrorist  hamilton tom zarek incited a prison riot that resulted in kidnapping attempted rape  he blew up a government building and now hes gonna sit on the quorum of 12  mcmanus wrong the government trumped up charges to discredit a man  whos dedicated his life for the disenfranchised  yes just a moment  commander adama why am i not surprised  roslin hello commander adama are you listening to this   indeed  cant allow a terrorist to sit in government  roslin my hands are tied i dont want to turn him into a martyr  sagittaron law allows a prisoner to regain his citizenship once hes served his time  tom zarek represents a danger to the entire fleet  i can bar him from travelling to cloud nine on that basis alone  i perfectly understand the threat tom zarek represents  but the last thing i need is for you to start acting like my own personal goon squad  we need to let this play out thank you  mcmanus  hold onto your shorts theres another story  were getting a live feed from the astral queen  tom zarek is about to make a statement  zarek citizens of the 12 colonies i am humbled and moved by this great honour  i will be a voice for those who have gone too long unheard  by a government that serves only the privileged and the powerful  that turns a blind eye to the needs of the weak and the poor  but roslin and her confederates will no longer be able to ignore us  zarek  people of the fleet look up the winds of change are blowing  a new era is about to dawn    hey doc  lt thrace to what do i owe this honour  our shuttle leaves for cloud nine at 0512 tomorrow so dont be late  our shuttle  a surprise getaway just the two of you   im going to be handling your security  please dont touch that thank you  baltar security for what starbuck you havent heard  its all over talk wireless  when would i have the chance to listen to talk wireless  i have 60 years of work in front of me  anyway talk wireless is just an excuse for lowbrow rabblerousing  youve been selected as capricas delegate to the quorum of 12  me  is this some kind of joke  guess you got the supergenius vote no accounting for taste  starbuck congratulations doctor baltar thank you  politics is the only thing more boring than blood samples  all those interminable speeches all that dreary pomp  parties full of young women drawn to men of power    but when the people call you must serve  apollo i cant remember the last time i felt the sunlight on my face  sure feels good almost like the real thing    starbuck they couldve done a better job with the horizon though  securitys going to be a bitch  a thousand different places for a sniper to hide  how many people are we dealing with  apollo five hundred plus  apollo each colonys sending a delegation of leading citizens  great herds of lookieloos any one of whom could be a cylon  apollo toasters arent our only problem dont you pay any attention to politics   no  a lot of unrest out there  so why is roslin insisting on letting so many people come  i guess she thinks its important to them  to be able to observe how their government works  so basically shes already running for reelection  apollo no kara    apollo kara give me that      security agent thank you sir enjoy your day  palacios the atmosphere is electric  as quorum members arrive with their delegations  im outside the cloud nine ballroom  where the reception of the new quorum of 12 will take place  the question is will president roslin shake the hand of the man  many still regard as a terrorist  or will she snub him and by extension all the people of sagittaron  col tigh   my wife ellen  welcome aboard  kill me now    col tigh    apollo starbuck apollo zareks here starbuck copy  starbuck dont worry this guys mine the second he makes a wrong move  apollo  yeah well youll have to beat me to him  murderer you dont belong here zarek go back  grimes what did you say hes not a murderer hes a freedom fighter  grimes all right apollo excuse me   may i see your security pass sir  not a problem  im a citizen of sagittaron ive got every legal right to be here  your rights dont extend to roughing people up  lay a hand on anyone else and youll be getting to know galacticas brig  apollo well everythings in order enjoy your stay on cloud nine  oh i will    zarek tom zarek tigh col tigh battlestar galactica  i see  my wife   does she have a name  ellen  zarek call me tom i dont like to stand on ceremony  im the same way all this pretension makes me sick  youre holding up the line  thank you for making me feel welcome ellen  i hope to see you again  why did you do that  to get our picture on the front page of every newsletter and photo service in the fleet  i dont need my picture taken with a terrorist  wake up saul look at these cameras    roslins the past zareks the future a blind man can see that  zarek madam president roslin mr zarek  if i were to offer you my hand in friendship  would you take it  well theres only one way to find out      zarek that was nicely played roslin thank you  just remember im not your enemy madam president  roslin and i know todays agenda is rather large  but i think that if youll look at the scheduled meetings  youll see that they concern issues vital to the fleet  in some cases existing policies  regarding matters such as the distribution of medical supplies  no 6 youre missing an intriguing opportunity  playas not wearing any underwear  dont be absurd    really  shes been eyeing you all afternoon  shes certainly human  youre not jealous  no 6 love isnt about sex gaius  thats an enlightened point of view  ive been thinking  as far as im concerned you can have any woman you want  but always remember  i have your heart  yes of course you do  i can always rip it out of your chest if i need to    roslin so if there are no objections  the chair will entertain motions to accept todays agenda as proposed  i have an objection    the chair recognises sagittaron  all the items on your agenda are important i agree  ration distribution education medical services all very important  but im frankly shocked to discover  the most critical issue of all is nowhere to be found  really well perhaps mr zarek could enlighten us  the election of a vicepresident  lf gods forbid anything should happen to you madam president  we have no designated successor  the civilian branch of our government would be paralysed  leaving the door wide open for a military dictatorship  sagittaron moves that the first item on the quorums agenda  should be nominations for vicepresident    second   second  second    caprica seconds for various reasons  which are far too obvious and numerous to go into right now  but certainly i think we can all agree that itd be a good idea to have a successor  the motion has been moved and seconded  all those in favour of opening nominations for the vicepresidency say aye  all aye  aye  roslin the ayes have it  the floor is now open for nominations the chair recognises virgon  now there is only one man here  who is willing to work for the betterment of people in this fleet  when i asked for his help  he sent a crew to fix the air filtration system on my ship  and hell they were finished and gone while i was still waiting  for the presidents office to return my call  i nominate tom zarek  thanks      is there a second  gemenon seconds the nomination  the nomination of tom zarek for the vicepresidency has been accepted    the chair will remain open for 72 hours for nominations  the session is now adjourned    roslin thomas zarek is not going to be my vicepresident  six months until the presidential election we couldve handpicked a candidate  it didnt shock me when bagot nominated him   but porter that was surprising  not really  the gemenon ships use more water per capita than any other ship  she wanted more rations i said no  zarek may have made some friends in the last few weeks  but there are still plenty who hate him  dont underestimate zarek  hes charismatic and knows what buttons to push  frankly madam president i am concerned about the security aboard cloud nine  roslin i want you leaning forward on this captain  roslin if they even sneeze they better have a handkerchief  understood  we need a candidate  someone who will quickly win the delegates support  an established name  im not a politician  roslin but you know how to get things done  youve kept this fleet functioning all this time  no thanks but  i cant allow tom zarek to be one heartbeat away from the presidency wally  roslin i need you  youve got me madam president  how can you reassure people that youre looking out for their interests  as opposed to the rehabilitation of tom zarek  thats a great question playa this is how i see it  were facing a situation so unique so specific  that i believe we need not only new leadership  but a whole new way of thinking  like blowing up a building or two  zarek if things werent so serious id say that was funny  look theres no economy theres no market no industry  no capital money is worthless  and yet were all held hostage by the idea of the way things used to be  zarek look where we are  zarek this man wakes up every morning  tugs on his boots and goes to work in this garden  zarek  why because its his job what job  he labours but he gets no benefit from his labour  hes not the only one  many of us are just still going through the motions of our old lives  the lawyers still act like lawyers but they have no clients   businessmen still act like businessmen but have no business  president roslin and her policies are all about holding on to a fantasy   if we want to survive we need to completely restructure our lives  we need to think about the community of citizens  the group not the individual  we need to completely free ourselves of the past and operate as a collective  youre not interested in the citizens you just want power  turn that crap off  i was listening to that broadcast  apollo you again  thats a shame  they want to hear mr zarek speak too dont you buddy  see he wants to hear mr zarek  how about you you want to hear what mr zarek has to say  i dont mind one way or the other  well i take that as a yes so turn it on   now  leave it  mr zarek is a representative of the people and we are the people  well youre people sort of  grimes you know i dont like your tone flyboy  so why dont you just move along out of here and go enjoy the imitation weather  id be happy to after you leave    which is now  grimes okay  dont want no trouble    starbuck what the hell            starbuck theres a gun    starbuck  starbuck incoming      apollo are you looking for this      the telamon buildings still standing thats delphi all right  now all we have to do is wait until dark  infiltrate the most heavily fortified military hub on this planet  hope the cylons havent completely wasted the spaceport  steal a ship locate galactica and fly to her without getting shot to hell   is that all  yeah    i guess we can relax until dark might as well make ourselves comfortable  boomer you hungry helo no not right now  helo your stomachs feeling better boomer starving  im trying to make sense out of the two women we saw with the cylons  and  i cant fathom why anybody would wanna help the toasters  and they just happened to be twins thats too weird  you got a better explanation    you think the cylons could be messing with human dna  helo cloning people or something  boomer could be  that would explain how they took us by surprise  they had these replicated humans infiltrating the colonies  laying the groundwork for the surprise attack  you know if they were human clones  that means theyre capable of complex emotions maybe even love  maybe they were misguided in the way that they were indoctrinated  whatever they are theyre not human no human could do the things theyve done  killed billions of innocent people  theyve got to be fracking cylons just like the rest of them  why do you have a summit itinerary  why circle every public appearance by president roslin    its not mine  some stranger wandered down the hall picked the lock to your room and left this  falsebottom with anechoic coating to absorb xrays   ceramic stealth gun  you sure went through a lot of trouble to get that weapon onboard  i carry a lot of money i need protection  apollo right   the moneys worthless your friend zarek pointed that out  i dont even know zarek  your pal grimes says different he gave you up  youre bluffing you havent got anything  we dont need anything valance  because this isnt a trial this is just you and us in this room  starbuck like zarek pointed out were living in a whole new world  no due process  this is your courtroom  and that would make us your executioners  starbuck so you might want to cooperate or else youre going out an air lock  because thats what we do to traitors  valance look i  i just came over here for the booze and the food  thats it  you know what frack you  apollo we put all the heat on valance we could but cant tie him to zarek  i know zareks behind this keep working on valance  we will to be safe i think you should send the sagittaron delegation back  cant violates their civil rights plays right into zareks hands  he could have another shooter on cloud nine  and if zarek wins the vote hes more than capable  of ordering your assassination and ascending to the presidency  zareks not going to win because im not going to let him  meanwhile keep zarek under surveillance tap his phones bug his room  if you find anything that remotely connects zarek to valance shut him down  the domestic policies weve been talking about over the last little while  such as employment housing and education  latest vote count seven for gray five for zarek  were slipping he was four an hour ago   zarek must be making promises  picon flipped  roslin  weve got to hold the colonies till they vote tomorrow  gray on page 33 of my mission statement  i lay out a 16point educational programme that the president and i have developed  individuals with fouryear college degrees will be eligible  hi how are you doing remember me  we got valance and youre next    gray health care its one thing to talk  zarek can i get you something ellen so you work here now  why should i ask the bartender to get me a drink   whats in it for him  a big tip  what would he spend on  so are you worried about wallace gray i hear hes ahead in the vote count  whatever the people want is fine by me  everyone has an agenda i know i do  zarek and what would that be  the same as yours tom me myself  and i    you are clearly a wellconnected wellinformed woman  ellen wife of the xo for whatever thats worth  quite a bit now and in the future  thats what im interested in tom my place  and my husbands place in the future  okay  im looking for a friend of mine his name is valance    how the hell did this happen  weve got to get to the president  mcmanus  were here with dr gaius baltar representative of caprica  dr baltar i had one question  is president roslins political career terminal or is there hope of resuscitating it  baltar laura roslins political career is very much alive  and to underestimate her would be a very serious mistake   you miss the limelight dont you gaius  yes i have   you have what dr baltar  nothing you were saying  you seriously believe that this school teacher  is able to handle the job of presidency  his wrists were slashed with broken glass from the room   so was it suicide or was it murder  it was no suicide   zarek had him killed  lf only we could prove that  howd they get past the marine guards  apollo through the vent  baltar  im glad to hear it  because all of us have had teachers who made an impact on our lives  history is full of examples of leaders  who have come from the most humble beginnings  and have risen to meet the challenge posed by cataclysmic events  apollo how many people knew where valance was being held  starbuck just the people in this room plus two marines  baltar  criticise roslin and the tough decisions she has to make every day  especially if youre someone like tom zarek  whos never shouldered any real responsibility in your life  to be fair to tom hes been in prison for the last 20 years  and now that hes had a drastic personality makeover  hes posing like hes the saviour to all your ills  i think you all have a short memory  well someone talked  and now we have no assassin no evidence of a plot  no check on zarek no nothing  if he can get to valance he can get to anyone  madam president he will definitely try and take a shot at you now  only if he wins the vote  what i have to say is we must survive   and we will survive  and we will do so through the values that have made our colonies great  courage truth justice liberty  with a firm and deep resolve to make tomorrow better  not just for ourselves but for our children    madam president i still worry the vote may be trending against you  roslin yes it is  but im going to win this thing  and tom zarek is going back to his prison ship where he belongs  roslin but first i have two very unpleasant duties to perform  i need a shuttle to cloud nine  what am i supposed to say   health reasons  oh right fine health reasons  you know all those years  i watched you working with adar  you were always so quiet so polite  so dignified  i never thought youd fit in with the bareknuckled backstabbing politicians  i guess i was wrong  all clear  dr baltar are you in here    baltar madam president  i heard you on the wireless you were very articulate quite engaging  oh thank you  thats very encouraging  yeah i was just trying to do my bit as the elected representative of caprica  besides im beginning to get a real feel for politics  so i take it youre not voting for mr zarek  a man who uses his intelligence and resources to blow up buildings  doesnt get my vote no  no im voting for your man gray hes really great  he is great which is why hes got my vote  roslin unfortunately  mr gray dropped out of the race   then who do you want me to vote for  i was thinking you  me   look  doctor lets cut to the chase  roslin youre a very popular man these days  roslin i would be fortunate to have your intellect  and your popularity right by my side  under those circumstances i accept  baltar thank you madam president roslin thank you  wow what are you going to do now  now  im going to give you an exclusive  baltar after you  so what are we supposed to do sit on our hands and watch her get killed  zareks too smart to take another shot at the president during the summit  if he wins the vote he can take her out later  when everyones forgotten about valance  hell just bide his time to find a better opportunity  thats great  anyway she says shes not going to lose the vote  she says a lot of things  dont you think you should wash that  starbuck i did  apollo like when a month ago   do you have a problem with my hygiene  you have hygiene  i clean up good sometimes all right  well let me know when its one of those times  tauron gaius baltar  the surprises just keep on coming  a number of the quorum delegates have now shifted their support  to the scientific genius  a man who is credited with saving the fleet on numerous occasions  at this point jim it is anyones guess  as to whos going to win but my money is on gaius dr baltar  aquaria thomas zarek    aerilon  tom zarek  palacios the vote is now sixfive in favour of tom zarek  the next vote will determine our new vicepresident  if zarek gets it he wins  in the event of a tie the president will cast the deciding vote      citizens  i give you your new vicepresident dr gaius baltar      the perks of power mr vicepresident  were going to do great things together  good its difficult to fathom i never aspired to power  of course you didnt gaius but someone had to step up   well after what laura told me  laura  baltar yeah were on a first name basis now  now look i think the people need me  excuse us    so  that bum knee of yours is looking pretty good  and the other ones not too bad either  lee if you want to ask me to dance just ask  you want to dance  me in a dress is a onceinalifetime opportunity   madam president  mr zarek  oh dont worry i wont be kissing you today  thats a shame  i shaved very closely in anticipation of being smacked by you  that was very nicely played  again  but theres still a presidential election in six months   ill see you then  i have no doubt  oh one thing you should know  i didnt kill valance  i wonder who did    madam president good evening  i thought you hated these things  its colonial day where else would i be im a patriot  you really are arent you  adama dr baltar interesting choice  i figured the devil you know  politics as exciting as war  adama definitely as dangerous  though in war you only get killed once  in politics it can happen over and over  youre still standing  so are you  and i can dance     i have a surprise for you  should i be worried    not unless you consider a day  in a luxury suite aboard the rising star as something to be worried about  what how did you swing that  i have my ways      what you need to do  is figure out a way to get slavedriving bill to give you the day off  tigh  yeah  and while were there we might want to talk to a few people   about your future  what  later my love it can all wait until later    any second now    if we get caught if anything happens  you dont have to say anything i know  were going to make it sharon okay    okay go                  sharon  were still alive why nobody else  you never get tired  trust me  helo come with me helo  helo
