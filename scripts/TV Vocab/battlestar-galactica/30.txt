                previously on battlestar galactica  lee you cant leave  you have to stay  you have to really stay  you must betray roslin and run for president in the upcoming election  i know its hard but its the only way  word of fisks murder spread out to the entire fleet  crew can fall apart when their commander is killed  pegasus lost two in a matter of weeks  im puting garner in command  but hes an engineer not a command officer  hes the best theyve got  pegasus buster  dradis intercept training birds are away  buster pegasus roger that take station be advised communications  will suffer sporadic interruptions due to stellar emi activity acknowledge  pegasus buster acknowledge our communications suck  is it gonna be like this all day  big time  those binaries are putting out so much emi even the dradis is barely working  well im gonna put a little distance between us and the fleet  get us out of the soup  see if we can get a cleaner dradis picture  whoevers in there times up lets go come on  gotta a couple of tired viper jockeys out here wanna sleep  go hit the showers duck well be gone by the time you get back  how you feel  not great  but cottles given me the thumbsup  and its been almost a month so i guess its back to work  so you ready to go into the belly of the beast  the beast  yeah  thats what they call the pegasus now  galacticas the bucket  the bucket and the beast  dont we make a pair  come on  no you come on  come on come on go  anyway its only a temporary assignment  i should be back again in a couple of weeks  whyd the old man pick you  one word  starbuck  is she in hack again  not yet  but apparently shes been driving commander garner up one bulkhead  and down the other ever since she took over flight training on  whatd you call it the beast  and since i wont be flying combat for a while i  were you going to mention these  oh yeah got promoted to major  well dont sound so happy  it doesnt mean much  i think it means a lot  well if you say so then it must be true  whats going on  we were unloading one of the containers and one of the crates shifted  so we looked inside and saw that something was moving  did you call it in  yeah we shut the door and the marines are on their way  give me a light  chief we dont know what were dealing with here dont you think we should wait  just wait out here  chief  is this the galactica  yeah  are you dr cottle   in distress  what the hell was that  i dont know we should call it in  i gonna spin up the ftl drive just in case  pegasus this is raptor 718  emergency request  say again shark  eve distress   bearing reek shuns  shark repeat your last did you declare an emergency  buster shark do you read  shark repeat your last did you declare an emergency  commander garner on deck  buster shark do you read  what have you got mr hoshi  im not sure sir  i think buster and shark are declaring an emergency but their transmissions garbled  weve lost them sir  season 2  episode 17 the captains hand  welcome aboard major  i didnt expect a welcoming committee  dont flatter yourself i was in the neighborhood  major adama sir  major adama  cdr garner  glad to see you major  although i wish it was under better circumstances  we have just lost contact with two of our raptors out on a training mission  what when did that happen  captain thrace  perhaps if you were actually down on the flight deck and monitoring  your raptors the way any training officer worth a damn would have done  you would know that four of our pilots were missing  major  you with me major  yes sir  they disappeared from the dradis about an hour ago  theyre gone  shut the hell up  we lose two raptors in a training mission  and i only find out when the commander throws it in my face  dont all speak at once  sir its been made clear  that discussing flight deck situations  with anyone outside pegasus crew is not allowed  sorry sir  and whose frakkinbright idea was that  it was garner wasnt it  of course it was  so barely competent and paranoid  theres a hell of a combination  i have a problem  that problems name is kara thrace  i know to handle her sir  and for the record she is one hell of a viper pilot  what i should cut her some slack  because shes good in the cockpit is that what youre saying  because nobody ever cut us any slack in the engine room  i could tell you that right now  but then i dont know  maybe being a snipe is different than being a viper jockey  no flashy stunts for us no flying by the seat of our pants down there  the engine room is like a finely tuned watch  and everything in it needs to be monitored and maintained  in a very precise fashion  nobody freelances  everything is done in the proper way at the proper time in the proper order  or thered be no power  no lights  no hot showers for your flyboys  you know major i think some of the people around here  could learn a thing or two from the snipes  im sorry madame president but its that time  campaign meeting  weve been putting it off for weeks  and we do have a presidential election coming up  unless youve decided not to run  yeah and to be perfectly honest with you ive thought about it a few times but  no im still here theres so much to do so  lets talk politics  great  here are the results from our first fleetwide poll  how did you manage this  i was precinct captain for the federalist party  in delphi for five years  we did polls to see what the mayor should have for lunch  for what its worth youve managed to walk a very fine line  youre presidential bid has the support of both the military and the civilian fleet  and youve received enthusiastic endorsements from the gemenese religious leaders  well it helps when your only real rival is a convicted terrorist  am i capable of leading this fleet  absolutely  and for a time  i almost had a chance  until laura roslin ascended  from politician to prophet  the truth is i cant win  but you could  you flatter me mr zarek really  but im not sure im cut out for a life in politics as i find  the vice presidency and everything to do with it very tedious  i would imagine carrying water for roslin  would get old after a time but its the office  that makes you the perfect candidate doctor  youre presold  really  to whom  youd be surprised how many people crave the assurances  of cold science as opposed to the superstitious ravings  of the gemenese  as a scientist you offer hope  think about it  and you tom  youll just step aside will you  im just happy to back a man of true conviction  a man  who remembers his friends  attention on deck  at ease  wheres stinger  hes in hack for mouthing off to garner  he stepped on his precious little toes  fracking garner  hes such an idiot  all right lock that up  get something straight  we got two missing raptor crews who are gonna be out of oxygen in 36 hours  thats all that matters  so everyone knock off the schoolyard crap and start doing your frackinjobs  now  we need to start thinking outside the box  which is supposed to be what you do best  sorry major  all right  i wanna know everything about these missing raptors and their crews  i wanna know personal quirks aircraft squawks  wireless transmissions anything that might help  good get to it  how is she  ryas four months pregnant  and doesnt want to be  i understand the gemenese have a problem with women terminating their pregnancies  tyrol said that she asked for you by name  do you want to tell me what thats really all about  pretty straightforward really i get a note that a girls on the way  she arrives i do my work and she leaves  i dont ask a lot of questions  youre gonna start  i wanna talk to her  im admiral adama  dont worry ive just come to talk  it doesnt matter what you say im not gonna change my mind  your parents are a little worried about you  theyve contacted me through the gemenon representative  my parents  gods  do you have any idea what they would do to me  please do not send me back  youre a stowaway  aboard a military ship  some people might say she was a victim of political persecution  hell she could apply for asylum  asylum  thats it  i want asylum  under gemenon law the girl is still the property of her parents  and they can deal with her once shes safely back on her ship  to be honest  im more concerned with the broader implications of this matter  sarah  i know you dont want to hear this  but my people my voters are demanding action on this issue  we have been through this  abortion was legal under colonial law  before the attacks and so it is still legal today  its obscene  the scriptures view abortion as an abomination in the eyes of the gods  you cannot equivocate on this point  if you want our support in the coming election  rya kibbys petition for asylum is under review  thank you sarah very much for coming in  im not turning that girl over  im certainly not banning abortion  then dont  but we have to move aggressively on this thing  im gonna arrange a conference call you and the quorum  either this is gonna get out of hand fast  shes not billy  no shes not  what  i hate to say this  because i know that this is a political issue  the fact is that that number  doesnt go up very often  i fought for a womans right to control her body my entire career  no  no  im just remembering what you said  right after the cylon attack  that if we really want to save the human race  wed better start having babies  nothing nothing and more nothing  where  is sharks last transmission  well  theres not much there  eve distress  bearing reek shuns emerge read  theyre in distress  they give a bearing requesting instructions  its an emergency can you read  maybe but whats this eve fragment here  eve distress eve distress  eve receireceived  received distress call  okay from who  i dont know  but maybe thats where they went to go find out  commander  captain thrace has a theory about our missing raptors sir  thats good considering she lost them  excuse me  they were out on one of your socalled training missions werentt they  my socalled training missions  okay lets just take this easy  thats when youre not boozing or sowing mutiny amongst the crew  mutiny  cdr  we should take this to a private place  dont you think i know whats happening on my own ship  barely competent and paranoid  that was off the record i was just venting  accurately  ill have you courtmartialled  commander  im not defending captain thraces behavior  thanks major  captain thrace youre restricted to quarters  until i can ship you back to galactica  youre adamas pet let him deal with you  major  yes sir  youve been on board less than four days  and youre already facing charges you dont waste any time do you  neither do you lee  hows it feel being garners new playmate  im here to do a job  yeah  keep a loudmouth disobedient frak of kara thrace in line  not doing such a good job are ya  evidently not  we dont have much time those guys are running out of air  yeah well i tried all right  all i have done since i got to the beast is try and help  and all ive gotten is garners foot in my ass  well maybe you need a kick in the ass  all right  here we go finally  what is your problem anyway  whats my problem  whats my problem  well kara my problem is you you keep frakking up  and i keep having to clean it up and i am officially sick of it  poor lee your life is so hard isnt it  you mean since i got shot  you wanna hear what i think happened to buster or not  pegasus red devil im nearing the last coordinates where our raptors went missing  repeat emer  we are in dist  buster is that you  buster this is red devil man is that you buddy come back to me  power failure oxygens almost out   of the gods help  sir  one of our search raptor just picked up a possible distress signal  from near where pegasus lost communications with busters ship  finally  possible distress signal  theres a theory that buster himself might have jumped away to run down  a phony distress call it could be a trap  a theory  is this your theory major  this is captain thraces theory is it not  mr thornton can you give us a fix on where this distress signal is coming from  yes sir its long range over 40 su away  then spin up the ftl drive and prepare to jump the ship  yes sir  sir  this isnt just captain thraces theory  i think this is a cylon trap and  and i disagree  now get admiral adama on the line  im going to get our men  admiral we finally got the break weve been looking for bearing on the distress signal  i can jump there inside of two minutes  commander believe me i understand how you feel  but the cylons have been known to lure ships into traps  using fake distressed calls  have you considered that  we have sir  its a scenario we dont think likely  we  major adama do you concur  sir  captain thrace and i are of the opinion that  the first two raptors may very well have been lured away by just such a trick  an opinion i do not share sir  well send a recon mission in full force  five raptors  three escort two rescue  you have your orders commander  yes sir thank you sir  thank you major  im sure your expertise is needed elsewhere  yes sir  yes i am curious  why the sudden interest in the fleets demographic projections  an issue has emerged that may prove divisive to our administration  i would like all the facts in hand before making my decision  so now its our administration  she must be desperate  well im a very busy man  luckily i made an initial calculation on these figures over seven months ago  when nobody seemed interested or concerned  all i had to do was factor in the numbers from the pegasus crew  it took me hardly any time at all and i didnt mind  look ill save you the bother you neednt read the report  if we continue on our present course  within the next 18 years the human race will simply be  extinct  since assuming the presidency ive made it my mission to maintain the rights  and freedoms we so enjoyed prior to the attack  one of these rights has now come into direct conflict  with the survival of the species  and i find myself forced to make a very difficult decision  the issue is stark  the fact is that if the civilization is to survive  we must must repopulate this fleet  therefore im issuing an executive order  from this day forward  anyone seeking to interfere with a birth of child  whether it be the mother  or a medical practitioner  shall be subject to criminal penalty  thank you  all flight deck personnel please report to stations  all right come on lets go lets go  captain case whats going on  weve been ordered to scramble condition one  ships getting ready to jump were gonna launch on the other side  get down to the hangar deck  what  look youre the best pilot weve got so get down there find a viper  its about time you admitted that  cdr  whats our sitrep  this is a rescue mission major  on whose authority  mine  im bringing my pilots home  with all due respect sir  but if this is a cylon trap then we are entering blind  we should send a force recon  my pilots are dying down there major im going in im not waiting on recon  this is in direct violation of the admirals orders  major leave combat  making this an illegal action  on your part sir  you are relieved major  i am forced to take command of this vessel  under federal regulations i place you under arrest  sergeant  take him below  sergeant the commanders been properly relieved escort him to his quarters  this man is not a member of this crew and you will obey  a direct order that you have been given by me and you will do it now  major youll come with me  admiral the pegasus has jumped theyre gone  dradis signals clean jump put is clear of any interference  sir i show two raptors transponder codes match theyre ours  mr hoshi  tell the cag to launch our recovery team and lets bring our people home  pegasus red devil  our two birds look intact  cant quite see inside yet  commander were unable to raise the raptors on wireless  pegasus both raptor crews are dead  i repeat theyre all dead  sir three cylon base ships just jumped into weapons range  oh my gods  theyre launching nukes brace for impact  damage report  two nuclear detonations in the stern sir  ftl drive inoperative sir  were stuck here sir  all right showboat  you take red squadron hitem on the right  catbird you take green hitem on the left  the rest of you follow me were going straight up the gut  sergeant i think you have better things to do  then the spinners fine  its gotta be a sensor just pull it  no no listen to me listen to me just pull it pull it  nuclear detonation  we have structural damage along the topside heat exchanger  we cant take much more of this how long before those drives are back up  i dont know they dont seem to understand  i need to go down there  you have the con  yes sir  i have the con  make for the nearest base ship  and roll us over to keep our top side out of their line of fire  hoshi contact starbuck and case  tell them ive assumed command  and to concentrate on protecting our top side  wilco pegasus we got your back  mr gaeta any contact  negative sir  base ship dead ahead were closing rapidly  we cant keep taking hits like this major  helm  steady as you go  have the bow battery stand by for a salvo fire  target their center axis  yes sir  see if we cant cut down the odds  we need those ftis fixed soon  or were dead  twentytwo hundred main battery has a firing solution  fire  coolant pressures offscale low  primary inlets choked  pressures dropping we gotta hull breach in there somewhere  we gotta get in there and open the auxiliary valve  we cant do that sir  we have to  sir that breach can vent all our oxygen into space  we dont have a choice now open the hatch  breathing gear  we used it all up fighting the fires sir  give me sledge  and a number 12 spanner  ok  now close this hatch behind me  were losing air close the gods damn hatch close it  base ships turning away  hes fracking running major  but the other two arent  theyre coming hard  helm  left full  im at the manifold  im gonna see if i can turn them  yes  theres definitely air escaping  through a crack over the svc relay  the breach is behind that  starbuck reports vipers are skosh ammo major  were down to throwing rocks at the bastards  we gotta haul ass outta here now sir  sir  come on garner  o2s in the red skipper youre almost out of air  you got it the pressures coming back up  now get the frack outta there come on  air is gone skipper get outta there  skipper  engineerings reporting a green board ftl drive online and ready  okay commence jump prep  bring our birds home  pegasus starbuck nobody behind me but toasters  now get us outta here  air wings back on board  landing bays secure  jump  you give garner a lot of credit  well its all true  he gave his life to save the ship  starbucks report wasnt so kind  well she had her perspective  and i had mine  in your opinion off the record  what was garners flaw  he was used to working with machines  command is about people  remember that  as you take command  of the beast  garner was my decision  his failures my responsibility  dont let me fail a second time  congratulations commander  madame president  word has it that you do not intend  to prosecute the gemenese girl on galactica  she has a name sarah  i think that rya has suffered enough  shes just been through an abortion  ive granted her asylum aboard galactica  this is in total violation of the law  my order came after she sought her procedure no laws have been broken  the girl belongs at home with her parents i insist  you have your pound of flesh  and i suggest you take your victory and you move on  maam  you realize youre screwed right  all the pressure the responsibility the sleepless nights  all the officers giving you a hard time  yeah well it could be worse you could be my cag  im gonna stay here and be galacticas cag  something about wanting to keep an eye on me  well you and colonel tigh have a lot of fun at those early morning briefings  cause the xos a lot of fun first thing  great  congratulations  really  congratulations  you deserve it  i know why i was mad at you kara  a simple thank you would have been sufficient  cause you were doing what you always did  buck authority and get away with it  i bucked authority once  and i almost lost everything  so i guess when i showed up on pegasus and there you were  doing it all over again  i dont know  pissed me off  doesnt make a lot of sense does it  you should hear the way my brain works sometimes  are we okay  you have a brain  madame president your decision to criminalize abortion has created a furor  do you think thats hurt your standing in the polls  absolutely  if i may madame president  it is true in the light of recent events  the president may have lost support in some quarters  i would ask the people to understand that if this is an extreme decision  we live in extreme times  the decision has been made with good faith  i however cannot with good conscience support it  i am so sorry madame president  but the cylon have no understanding of the meaning of the word freedom  how could they theyre programmed  machines  every time you take away one of our freedoms  every time you restrict or curtail one of our rights  we become one step closer to being like them  as the vice president  i am bound to follow the administrations lead  as president  i should have no such strictures  given the current situation  im afraid that i have no alternative but to announce that i am as of now  a candidate for the presidency
