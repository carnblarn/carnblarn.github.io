all right maam just walk this way  battlestar galactica  3x14 the woman king   so what have we got here mike  mellorak sickness it originates in the kidneys and then  rapidly attacks the respiratory and the immune system  its a nasty bit of business  if you dont treat the first symptoms within 48 hours  itll kill you within three to five days  how contagious is it  well its not airborne so we lucked out there  its spread through human contact saliva sexual intercourse  through the skin  right now it seems confined to the sagittarons  thats good theyre welcome to it  its obviously spreading down there  where we were working  its curable  absolutely yes a shot of bitamucin  and youre right as rain in a day or two  and sedatives alleviate the symptoms  but i dont know how long our stock of bitamucin will hold out so we should probably  conserve it and only inoculate after the first symptoms show  this is a civilian infection dr robert so its in your hands  but i want tyrol and the crew immunized before they get sick  i dont need any downtime  if we disinfect everything and stress hygiene  some people wont get sick and uh they wont need the medicine  then shouldnt we get everyone to the showers  especially the sagittarons we should make an announcement  no no we dont want to  single them out anymore than we already have to well have a riot on our hands  now if it were up to me i would say just get the sagittarons  settled and then deal with the civvies that have already arrived  huh well at least you wont have to worry  about having enough medicine for the sagittarons  yeah most of them are gonna refuse it  people are gonna die  the last 3000 years medicines been just the great curse  thats because theyre a bunch of stubborn rootsucking  jackasses holding onto traditions that are a thousand years old  drink this  stink enough for you in here  yeah its a really potent smell  thats burdock root sagittarons use it as a calmative  does it work  hell i dont know theyre all gonna die anyway  tell me there wont be a trial  gaius baltar will be tried for high crimes and treason  a tribunal of judges will hear the evidence against him a verdict will be read  he will be found guilty and he will be finally held responsible for his actions  if you can summon up a little patience as i have done  we will get through this ordeal  listen to me  baltar will get his trial and this is what youll get  a hurricane  the media will descend on you and watch  and scrutinize and question your every move you will have  sectarian violence you will have assassination attempts  you will have civil unrest on a scale weve never seen  work labor everyday routine in this fleet will come to a complete halt  this trial is going to bring the entire fleet down  mr vice president we have a security plan in order which includes  rapid marine deployment increased cap operations security details  a hurricane laura  if i were you id declare martial law during the trial  youre gonna need a lot more than a little patience to survive  im here if you need me  your best friend your worst enemy  ive never seen him like that  he was truly frightened  we are not sick sagges brought the sickness with them  send then back  okay sir where do you suggest that i send them  i dont know figure it out  okay your concerns have been noted   were gonna do the best we can  yeah right  yes can i help you  my son is dead  im sorry  thats a soma braid right  you sagittarons believe its supposed to bring good health  look im sorry its not enough  if you dont treat the disease its fatal okay this  this didnt have to happen  yes it did he was killed  no maam he died okay he died because he needed real medicine  he died because i made a mistake  okay okay good yeah and please tell the others  i will i will tell them not to trust him  they warned me about him but i wouldnt listen  i didnt want my son to die  i took a chance i went to dr robert  i let the doctor give the medicine to willie  maam  you waited too long  willie had been sick for less than 12 hours  he was 19 he is dead  that doctor killed my son  we lost another one last night  yeah willie king  no a threeyearold girl whose parents refused to let me treat her  willie kings mother lost willie king  its a shame he was a goner you saw him when he was in here  he was at least three days symptomatic  you explained this to the mother  yes of course i did i mean what the hell am i supposed to say to her  sorry maam but if you wouldve just  turned the corner a little sooner  on your superstitious crap we couldve saved your son  get your shirt off would you  excuse me  im gonna vaccinate you  but im not sick i thought we were rationing  you think im gonna wait until youre on your back for a day  who the hell else is gonna help me around here  okay okay  oh i talked to tigh he was asking about you  i told him you were doing a hell of a job  i wouldnt wish this place on anybody   come on you ready  yeah  this might sting a bit  youre done  come on all right hands of stone let me see what you got  put it in the hole marge  wanna know my secret connor  i pretend this thing is your face  hey its mellorak man everybody run  relax the doc dosed me  i hear its pretty rough down there huh  only if youre a sagittaron  dying you know it just seems so senseless  yeah well youll get no tears from me  its bad enough my gangs gotta sweat through their stench  i have feeling one of these days were gonna wake up in the morning  im gonna be really pissed cause were out of meds  cause those frakkoids saw the light and now we gotta share  you gonna babble or shoot  none of those religious freaks lifted a finger on new caprica   against the cylons  hey chief knock it off  well a lot of good resistance people lost their lives  hey i said knock it off all right  sorry dee  its all right  i have more of a reason to be mad at them then you do i am sagittaron  most of them are paranoid pigheaded and argumentative  yeah well theyre sure making it miserable for dr robert  medicines an abomination its a sin against the gods  physicians are reading disease because they refuse to acknowledge that the body  there you go  and the mind are myths  well this bodys no myth  if i get sick im going to see dr robert  youre not getting sick  anyone but cottle nearsighted bastard  may as well use a spike instead of a needle  so theyre treating you well then  yeah well enough  take a while to get to the point though dont they  look six i want to thank you for what you did  im still not sure why you did it though  exactly  what are we doing here  how could you possibly throw yourself on the mercy of these people   and now youre here  yeah  your best chance of survival is to work with them  and that means to help them expose baltar for his crimes  look i gotta go so im gonna look into some clothes for you  please take care of yourself  hey  thank you for the visit  to have some company  thank you  yeah i care about you  do you think any of them care about you  i imagine they dont  so what are you doing here again  im still trying to figure that out  so youre here to save him are you  i told you i dont know  you are here  because you want to be human  but theres a trick to being a human  you have to think  only about yourself   okay what do you think shes doing now  i dont know  like shes talking to something or someone i dont know ive seen her do it before   stay back  dr robert he murdered them  hes trying to kill us  is a murder  everybody back  step away get off him now  move back move back   back away now  he killed my father  i tried to help him you ignorant fool  okay get behind me  so you immunized the old man but he later died  buckminster and his father are fundamentalists  what made them change their minds about getting immunized  change their mind  who said they changed their mind i administered the bitamucin on my own  without their consent  look it was the middle of the night i was doing my rounds  and the old man was screaming in pain  i mean what was i supposed to do  okay i dont understand arent we rationing it was well after the 48 hours  yeah thats right but its not exact everybodys different  okay he was marginal look im not gonna sit here  and apologize to you for doing my job  i got two picons down there that are starting to show symptoms  now w im gonna go treat them if its alright with you  the doctors version of when he administered the drug  greatly differed from that of mrs king  who  the woman king the one i told you about mrs king  her son started showing symptoms she immediately took him to robert for treatment  the boy still died  in the other case robert treated a sagittaron without the mans consent  well thats something we probably should have done to all of them in the first place  this disease wouldve been gone by now  the only reason we didnt is were trying respect the customs of the sagittarons  but thats the point he didnt respect them sir  people could be dying under roberts care  people die under my care every day it goes with the damn job   killing doesnt  killing  you are way out of line   micah robert deserves better than this  even if im wrong  even if he isnt treating some of these people unethically  im concerned hes created a situation down there  its bad  captain  i have the former president of the colonies sitting in a prison cell  and a cylon woman is in custody  and a population that would love nothing more than to tear both of them apart  my ship is overcrowded and i have an epidemic on my hands  now the question is  are you capable of doing your job  and are you going to stop making these unfounded accusations  are you  yes sir  dismissed  agathon  why dont you knock it off helo  get your teeth out of the docs ass  its not doing you any good  with all due respect sir  i think micah robert might be hurting people  he is the only one whos had anything good to say about you in as long as i can remember  you may as well take whatever credibility you have left and chuck it out an airlock  you seriously want to stand up for these crazy frakkin people what is it with you  you just like being on the outside looking in do you  i dont quite know what you mean by that sir unless youre referring to my wife  again  mike robert is a standup guy  a caprican one of our own a man i can trust  on new caprica he worked with the resistance he patched up my eye  he fought the enemy  while you were snuggled up in bed with your cylon wife every night  colonel  you okay  so  you do give a frak what your friends think good for you  thats how it should be  but you know what  i give a frak too  about friends about loyalty you keep soiling mike roberts good name  and we are gonna finish this  hows that sound to you  you better have the doc take look at that hand now  sorry but youre going to have to wait  excuse me excuse me  back in 15 minutes im sorry  excuse me excuse me sir get your hand off me   sharon  helo  hey whats going on  hows hera  what do you mean hows hera  she got sick about an hour ago they pulled me off cap  what are you talking about no one

this to give to you  he gave you this  how is your daughter  shes fine thanks  good  mrs king please  i need to ask you something  if you thought dr robert was dangerous why let him treat your son  i mean you said you were warned  i couldnt believe anyone could have that much hate inside of them  but you understand how some of this doesnt  i am through talking  talking isnt going to bring willie back  i think you should leave now  mrs king i  im sorry  you seem angry  im not im just  work  its okay that you hate your job  its okay to admit it too  its not the job  i know the job sucks i dont need to be reminded of it  okay  then what is it  look  its what i see every day okay its hard to not see it  see what  talk to me karl  i dont know i  i keep doing it you know i keep doing it i keep ending up on the wrong side of everything  you know maybe tighs right maybe i want it that way  what if im flying a desk not because im good at it  not because im right guy for the job  but because its the right punishment for the guy who crosses the line and everybody knows it  maybe i belong in dogville  so youre saying  leave it  what does that mean just leave it  it means its your job to manage these people helo and youve just got to do it  yeah you know what  youre right  its me  its all in my frakkin head  i didnt say that  where are you going  i dont know  you ought to try a bed

bitamucin in the king boys body  he died because it was too late  no he didnt he died of acute cell destruction  he was injected with a toxic bisphosphonate  now obviously you got a wrong reading here

thanking me for saving your daughters life  for having the meds to cure her of her illness  now you know how painful this disease is at the end  and they dont want our help now why waste time  and meds and space on them when all of those resources  could go to those who really deserve it  who gets the medication when theres not enough to go around  the sagittaron who wont even raise a finger to save his own race  or a viper pilot  what the hell happened to do no harm doctor  look i intervened because someone has to make the tough choices here  but it doesnt matter it doesnt matter because look at them  theyre gonna destroy themselves anyway look at them look at them  theyre like worms crawling on a hot rock  remember what you used to say saul  aside from a cylon is there anything that you hate more than a sagittaron  ill tell you what i hate mike  being wrong  captain agathon  sir  arrest this son of a bitch gag him if you have to  my pleasure sir  i didnt harm her  right shes one of the good ones  sir you wanted to see me  yes captain please sit down  theres hate and theres allowing hate two sides of the same coin really  were guilty of both  somewhere we got lost  you being the lone voice in the wilderness we were bound to stay that way for a while  this is my ship  and i owe you an apology   thats not necessary sir  all the same  you still have it  thatll be all captain
