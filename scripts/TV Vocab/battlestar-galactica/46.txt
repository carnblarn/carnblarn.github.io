                previously on battlestar galactica  no im sorry i cant live like this  so i wont divorce and you wont cheat   so where does that leave us  trapped   whats this  this orders the summary executions  of all the detainees listed on the next page it requires your signature  this is a death warrant have you seen the names on this list  do you have any idea what theyre about to do up there  if you really are a cylon a member of the final five  these feelings are just part of your programming  the final five revealed only to those who enter the temple  only to the chosen one the chosen one  her destiny will part company from yours gaius  shes not the chosen one you are  dear god tell me the truth before i die  am i a cylon  welcome home mr president  close your eyes go to sleep  babys in the cradle counting sheep  climb up to your house of dreams  babys in the cradle fast asleep  should i die before i wake  sorry  improvising  youre doing the right thing gaius   gaius  what  yeah  yes  wake up  close your eyes go to sleep  babys in the cradle counting sheep  climb up to your house of dreams  wait  wait a moment  i need some time to think this through  too late gaius  its time to learn the truth   sergeant  sorry sir  no one can speak to the prisoner without presidential authorization  i have authorization i need to speak to the prisoner  step back sir  thats it gaius  deep breaths  deep breaths  thats it gaius deep breaths  deep breaths  the first times the hardest youre doing wonderfully  im alive  im alive  thank god im alive  i always told you to have faith  then no one was betrayed  i was never one of them  i am one of you  is that what you think gaius  i knew it  i always knew i was different  special  maybe a little gifted  that was a bit rough actually that hurts   whats wrong  youre wrong gaius  youre not cylon youre human and youre dead  hes alive  ill get cottle   well im just saying youre gonna be surprised   yeah well major  right this way  joes i think ive seen a bar before  youve got to be frakkin kidding me  come on  hey this way hey joe  chief tyrol welcome  any friend of the major is a friend of mine which means  you get the good stuff  thank you very much dont mind if i do im not going home tonight so  you and cally have a fight  you didnt hear us i figure we could have sold tickets  to marriage why we build bars  joe  i warned about the dangers of sleep deprivation  psychosis can make a man do strange things  and baltars little hunger strike is not helping either  the bastard wants to die that bad i say let him  bottom line we need baltar to talk  if the other cylon saw the same symbols that we saw  they could be on their way to earth or be setting up an ambush by now  im betting that after tonight hell be more willing  doc wait an hour or two i want him cogent  i also dont want him to starve   what do you expect me to do about it  i expect you to make sure he eats  ill see about putting security cameras in that cell  mr gaeta  what exactly were you doing going to see dr baltar in the middle of the night  i couldnt sleep and i guess i thought he might be willing to talk to me  we understand just leave his interrogation to us  of course  youre up late   you know the chief says hi  he one of your new drinking buddies  i would invite you but you made it very clear its not your thing  no its your thing and thats not what i was asking  i have a briefing at 0500  are we still on for dinner tomorrow  damn it yeah   cause i already switched watches  sure  itd be nice for a husband and wife to occasionally  forget it  thank you  you can leave the door open  hi  touch madam president  i have no wish to see you suffer  really  ive just had the pleasure of having a tube  forced up my nose and down my throat  everybodys gotta eat  its for your own good  and its nothing compared to what many of our people  were subjected to in your jail cells on new caprica  not my jails  the cylons  its an academic distinction at this point doctor  you know none of us are enjoying this  so why dont you just tell me what i need to know  and your suffering will come to an end and i promise you this  i know nothing about the cylon plans or their whereabouts  i witnessed nothing in that temple  my information on cylon intelligence is  is limited to say the least  prior to the attack on the colonies did you have highlevel security clearance   yeah so what  did you tell anybody about it  did you let someone into the defense mainframe   careful gaius  the blonde woman  that i saw you with on caprica just prior to the attack  shell flush you out of an airlock without a moments hesitation  unless of course  that prospect no longer frightens you  lies  all lies  a rehash of all the other old lies  i did not collude  in the genocide of my own people  this is devlin and maryanne mcallister and their son and daughter  this is a family of four that was gunned down in their own home   on suspicion of harboring insurgents  i am not responsible  just wondered if you recognized even one of these faces  did any image get through to you  on the rare occasion when you ventured out from behind your sandbags  and your razor wire to see what was happening to your people  your people  i need to know now  colonel tigh get in here  get this man out of here hes not gonna talk  i want you to take him i want you to toss him out the nearest airlock  this is about exacting your pound of flesh  guards get in here now   what happened to my fair trial  take him out of here  get your motherfrakkin hands off me  i demand a fair trial  i am a citizen of the colonies and i demand a fair trial  a fair trial  take a good look doctor  these are just a fraction of the people you sent to their deaths  rather fitting they should see you take your last steps  stop stop wait stop  what what  you asked me if i know any of these people   i know that man  show me  show me let him go let him go keep your guns up  this man  his name was adrian bauer my lab assistant for three years on caprica  so what  he was gemonese i got him a visa i introduced him to his wife  i am godfather to their first child  i wouldnt do anything to harm this man or his family  or anybodys family  i am not a murderer i am innocent why wont you believe me  get him take him out here  is this what you call colonial justice  what did i ever do for you huh  only save your bleeding life  you gave it your best shot   i understand  yeah the bastard still wouldnt talk  either hes got more stones than i gave him credit for or  or he knew you were bluffing  well  what do we do with him now  there is one thing  admiral  the military once ran  an experimental interrogation program involving drugs  hallucinogens specifically  the goal of the program was to create a state of anxiety so intense  that the subject believed that their very survival was at stake  the interrogators  would exploit that  become less an adversary and more a lifeline  at least that was the idea  it might get baltar to talk tell us what the cylons know about earth  but its dangerous  especially for someone in baltars condition  are you telling me we have these drugs aboard galactica  youre being awfully accommodating  is that how it looks to you  your estranged twotiming bitch of a wife calls you up for a quickie  and you hop on the first shuttle  id say yeah  ive been thinking about some stuff kara  oh yeah like what  like  what that crazy skinjob leoben said about you and  a special destiny  i mean what if theres something to that  kara thrace and her special destiny  it sounds more like a bad cover band sam  think about it though  why did i survive all those months on caprica waiting for you to return  if i was just gonna walk out on you  and you  i mean did you go through that hell locked in the fake house  with that fake husband just so you could ditch me  i dont think so  you know when i think about it like that  do you love him  what  lee kara  do you love lee  gods sam   maybe  i dont know  then you gotta go to him  i thought you were off duty  i am yeah  i was jut gonna stop by the bar for a little while  if youre gonna see kara just admit it  look i told you theres nothing going on  people have told me  lee wont cheat hes too noble   only problem is its all a crock  you know what the only problem is  the only problem is that you dont trust me thats it  and this is just your own frakkin insecurities talking  same as always  i mean right from the getgo  the very first morning that i proposed  you know what forget it  this is frakking pointless  no youre right  i did see this coming  and i was naive enough to marry you anyway  you want to know why lee  cause i loved you  i loved you so frakking much  i thought i was lucky  thats right  lucky  that i could have you for just as long as you  or kara would let me  dee  come on come here  its not a marriage lee  this is a lie  you want to be with kara  go ahead  i wont stand in your way  its over  wait where are you going  sam  i gotta get going  so so long  i love you  im a human being  im a human being i have rights  i said i have rights  please  please help me  im not sure i can gaius  pain is one thing  but this  without free will what are you  can god even pity such a creature  why not just admit youre doing this for your own satisfaction  thats the truth isnt it  why arent you putting the needle in yourself   hold his head  oh no no  oh god  hes under  try not to make any loud noise  put the head strap on  my god where am i  what are you saying  if i leave sam   will you still leave dee  my gods kara  i mean  you know how do i know that tomorrow youre not gonna pull another 180  i mean these are our frakking marriages were talking about  its not some stupid dogfight we can just jink our way out of  think about it lee thats what youre best at  where am i  my god where am i  can you hear my voice  can you hear me doctor  admiral is that you  im looking for you doctor  i cant find you can you tell us where you are  its water  im in the water  its cold and its dark  i cant see anything  is there anything that you can see that can tell us where you are  look for the light can you see the light   yes  try to reach for the light  thats it  thats it  thats it  follow the light  caprica  caprica six  she saved my life  shielded me from the explosion  doctor did you conspire with her to subvert our defense system  conspiracy requires intent  i never intended  but then she said deep down id always suspected  but i didnt know  how could i know  did i conspire  did i  no  no  i dont know  no  it wasnt my fault  it wasnt my fault  i am not responsible  she  caprica six  she chose me  chose me over all men  chosen to be seduced  taken by the hand  guided between the light and the dark  but is she an angel or is she a demon  is she imaginary or is she real  is she my own voice of the voice of  i cant stay afloat much longer  then give us details doctor  give us details about the cylons or well let you drown  alone in the dark  hey chief  why is it so frakkin hard  why cant we just  get back to normal  normal ha  what is normal anyway  chief you can tell me if im out of line here  but um  do you ever think about sharon  no  come on  you never wonder what if  no  look dont leave me  dont leave me i know im flawed  i never claimed to be yeah mistakes  mistakes were made terrible mistakes  were they mine  am i solely to blame  i was a player thats all i was a player  i was struggling  trying to find my place in gods plan  in gods resolve  i never intended for certain things to happen   doesnt that matter  you took the cylons to the temple  to the eye of jupiter what did it tell them  what did it tell them about earth  i wasnt looking for  what were you looking for doctor  what were you looking for  their faces but they wouldnt show them to me  their faces  whose faces  the five  the final five  the final five cylons  i thought i might be one of them  i told them i wanted to be one of them  a cylon  why  all my sins forgiven  a new beginning  are you a cylon dr baltar  no  thats not good enough doctor  tell me tell me what you told the cylons  what do they know tell me  or ill have to let you go doctor  ill have to let you go  tell me or ill have to let you go doctor  ill have to let you go  watch where youre going  wheres my ring  has anybody seen my ring  i lost my ring  has anybody seen my ring  where is it  admiral were losing him  thats enough  im putting an end to this freak show right now  now listen to this  five final cylon models  five pillars of the temple  for the five priests  devoted to the one whose name cannot be spoken  come on its all just mumbo jumbo  hes holding a lot back admiral im sure of it  then maybe we should resort to more direct methods  direct methods now you have my vote  no  we tried the stick  its time to try the carrot  the thing hes most deeply afraid of is   even if he talks well kill him  smart man  we have to ease his fear make him believe that if he collaborates  at the very least hell have his life  he wont buy that coming from us  of course not  we have to find someone he trusts  as perverse as it may seem  i may actually owe these people a debt of gratitude  i realize theres probably nothing i can say that can make this right  but theres something you need to know  i asked you to marry me because i was in love with you  just like im in love with you now  they forced me  to admit my failings  and now that i have i feel positively liberated  you were right  i loved kara  and you know maybe theres a part of me that always will  in my heart  i know i have always done  what ive had to do  but i married you  i married you  and you know when i look back at our marriage  at the time that we have spent together  you are good for me dee  and i need you  and i dont think i ever  really realized that  till i knew that i was losing you  i cant promise you a trial doctor  but im sure that if youll give them something anything  but please just give me another chance thats all im asking  just give me a chance  these charts that ive been using to plot our course to earth  ive never been confident of my calculations  thats lucky because the calculations are wrong  i detect a number of inconsistencies right off the bat you see  these figures here are wrong  thats exactly what i was afraid of  the cylon navigation systems are far more advanced than our own  but i have managed to commit many of their algorithms to memory  if you can offer them this kind of help  im certain at the very least theyll spare your life  maybe we can even get you out of this cell  and offer you some proper quarters  creature comforts theres the clincher  sorry  where is it   where is what doctor  where is what  so much for that little stratagem  hello  hey  you all right  listen we dont have to stay here if you dont want to okay  yeah  two whiskeys straight up  i should have known that youd betray me  what did you tell them  that you stayed behind till the grisly end on new caprica  so you could what so you could uh  you could feed information to the resistance  who do you think allowed you to do that   thats a lie  no its not a lie  you think im blind  you see i literally had a gun  pointed to my head  but nobody forced you to play both sides  so im asking you mr gaeta  who is the real traitor in this room  to the first of many   lets do another  yeah  thank you  i am not a traitor  no of course because there are for worse things than being a traitor  arent there felix  if your friends only knew the truth  dont worry  we gotta get in there  get away from me  frak you  lt gaeta step away from the prisoner now  step away from the prisoner i will not ask you again  stand down sergeant   step back mr gaeta  no no no sir  i cant i cant let him live not after what hes done  mr gaeta  mr gaeta wait please look at me  i understand what youre feeling   no you dont  yes i do  the other night you didnt come here to interrogate dr baltar  you came here to kill him didnt you i understand that i do   whats his condition  he missed the artery hell live  better get him to sick bay get a gurney in here right away  go easy on him  all things considered gaius  it could have been worse  much worse  and though youre not one of the five  you certainly have the luck of the gods  well i am the chosen one  you didnt go tell them that did you  no  everybodys gotta have a secret  i told him i didnt take any satisfaction in seeing his pain  but the truth is i was willing to see him endure a great deal of suffering  in order to get what i wanted  it wasnt some intelligence or some truth  i wanted a genuine admission of guilt  thats something that youre not gonna get from someone like baltar  he doesnt see himself that way  its not who he is  in his eyes  hes the victim  not the criminal  its not too late for him  to just disappear  we cant do that  for all his crimes hes one of us  so what happens next  we give him his trial  gentle  thank you  what we really know is that baltar is not really involved in the attack  and  we need more  and i need to know that i wont be airlocked  no you will not be airlocked i give you my word  like the one you gave to leoben before sending him rambling out into space  he told us   thank you to watch bsg with our subs
