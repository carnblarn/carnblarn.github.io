real  like sharon you know  same grin same laugh all the little things  i fell in love with a machine  its stupid so just call me an idiot and lets be done with it  youre an idiot all right youre an idiot  but the cylons have a way of making all of us look like idiots  kara what are you doing making a pit stop  ive got something i gotta pick up  hey we gotta keep going i got a place here helo  the cylon virus spawned itself in our subsystems before we broke the network  i had teams cleaning each subsystem  but itll be at least an hour before we restore main power  captain what few marines we have  are assembling at their checkpoint but comm is spotty  where are the cylons  it looks like they split into two forces one moving forward  forward one moving aft yes sir  ive seen this before these are their objectives  secondary damage control and auxiliary fire control sir  if theyre successful they will override our decompression safeties  and vent us all into space  once were all dead theyll turn the ships guns on the fleet and wipe it out  once and for all    dr baltar  how in gods name did you find us  what do you have there  its a child obviously  a child  can i hold it  please

   he killed our baby  our baby  adama i saw him drown the baby  why would anyone want to drown a baby gaius the answer is all around us  what happened here human sacrifice  not the fairytales your scriptures would have you believe  i thought kobol was supposed to be a paradise or something  some place where  gods lived with the humans in harmony or  for a time perhaps then your true nature asserted itself  your brutality your depravity your barbarism  so the scriptures are all a lie  its all just a lie just a coverup for all this savagery  exactly  all of this has happened before gaius and all of it will happen again  adama  mankinds true nature will always assert itself  so he will try and kill our baby  only if you let him gaius  only if you let him  keep your eyes up ahead come
