more people  giving up my seat    ive decided youre an expression of my subconscious mind  playing itself out during my waking states  so im in your head    no  therere maybe cylon agents living among us  some may not even know theyre cylons at all  they could be sleeper agents  programmed to perfectly impersonate human beings until activation          and one minute to mark            god has a plan for you gaius he has a plan for everything and everyone  gaius are you even listening to me    pilot passengers 30 seconds to mark  roslin planet men women age  you know what do this after the

have appeared again  however our ftl drive is now working and we will jump momentarily  baltar five days now    there are limits  to the human body the human mind  tolerances that you cant push beyond  well those are facts  provable facts  everyone has a limit  all right you know the drill people scatter formation  apollo keep them off the civies and dont stray beyond the recovery line    watch the

last attack    do you want children gaius    let me think about it for a minute  no  procreation is one of gods commandments  really  im sure some day if youre a good cylon hell reward you  with a lovely little walking toaster of your very own  i want us to have a child gaius  baltar you cant be serious   its dr amarak  what was that  im so sorry for interrupting you while you were speaking  you were just saying  i was just saying that a dr amarak   has requested to speak with the president  dr amarak i see  you know him  have you always been able to multitask like this  yes  i used to work with him at the ministry of defence  it says here that hes uncovered important information  regarding how the cylons were able to defeat colonial defences  i was always a little worried he was on to us  were you going to speak to him  baltar perhaps i should speak to him if youre busy  billy i think he wanted to speak directly with the president  it sounded urgent  it must be very important  maybe something about a certain traitor in the presidents inner circle  theres not enough time before we jump  i want him on board first thing during the next cycle  thank you doctor   id say you have a serious problem  lf i can help  hes a strange one isnt he                        man  landing base team alpha check three  dualla can you see it  twelve more cases of nervous exhaustion that makes

this  apollo i have no idea  neither do i youre the cag act like one  what the hell does that mean  it means that youre still acting like youre everyones best friend  were not friends youre the cag  be careful out there  our job isnt to be careful its to shoot cylons out of the frakking sky  starbuck good hunting is what you say  and now one of your idiot pilots is acting like a child  and refusing to take her pills so she either says yes sir  and obeys a direct order or you smack her in the mouth  and you drag her sorry ass down to sickbay and you make her take those pills    well im glad im not working for you  youre damn right youre glad  so do i have to smack you in the mouth lieutenant  no sir ill take my pills  perfect   carry on  yes sir  dispatcher pilots to ready room for preflight briefing pilots to ready room  what                jump 238 complete  adama start the clock  gaeta  thirtythree minutes  mark  all civilian ships present and    strike my last  one civilian ship missing and unaccounted for sir  tigh which one dualla the olympic carrier  dualla commercial passenger vessel adama were they left behind  dualla i think i accounted for all civilian ships before we left  you think did you or didnt you    theyre not logged in sir i think they may have been left behind  how many people aboard ship   youre telling me we left over 1300 people to die at the hands of the cylons  it may not have been her fault sir  it may have been a navigational error and they jumped to the wrong coordinates  or the cylons destroyed the ship before the jump  or 50 other things may have happened  the point is we dont know what the hell did happen  yes were tired yes theres no relief  yes the cylons keep coming after us time after time  and yes we are still expected to do our jobs  we make mistakes people die  there arent many of us left  carry on    okay next crisis     list of calls  yes  but first wheres the doctor whos supposed to be on board  whats his name   dr amarak  yes  dr amarak  oh  he was on the olympic carrier    no 6 god is watching out for you gaius  the universe is a vast and complex system  coincidental serendipitous events  are bound to occur indeed they are to be expected   its part of the pattern part of the plan  dr amarak posed a threat to you  now hes gone logic says theres a connection  baltar a connection maybe but not god  there is no god or gods singular or plural  there are no large invisible men or women for that matter  in the sky taking a personal interest in the fortunes of gaius baltar  be careful  that which god gives he can also take away      fifteen seconds    maybe this time  dradis  no enemy contacts  keep the clock running  what do you think  i think we wait          get me the president  why this time  was it something that you did  we had a new plan but we didnt have time to implement it yet  we lost a ship during the last cycle the olympic carrier  does that have something to do with it  adama possibly    are you there  yeah im here  what do we do now commander ive got people on the verge over here  were gonna go to condition two we have to take advantage of this time   and let our people get some rest  all right  and how long do we stay at condition two  until im satisfied theyre not going to return  adama its a military decision  it is i know that  youre right and i defer to your decision and commander  let your men and women  know how grateful i am for the job that they are doing please  thank them for me  adama thank you madam president  adama thank you  adama contact apollo  adama tell him to set up a combat patrol around the fleet  and order his other pilots to land immediately  all right people you heard the order  boomer starbuck form up with me well fly the first cap  apollo i want everyone else back on galactica and in their racks  apollo threehour rotation starbuck hey apollo  not that im not honoured by being chosen to sit in my cockpit  for the next three hours but  apollo but why you   take a guess  because im on drugs   you got it this patrol is 100 stimulated  crashdown anyone else feels like  theyve got frakking ants crawling behind their eyeballs  apollo how about you boomer  doc tells me youre holding up better than anybody in the squadron  boomer im tired like everybody else  apollo you never seem it starbuck because shes a cylon  youre gonna make me come over there and kick your ass  okay lets set up a patrol here  before somebody gets hurt  apollo follow me starbuck copy that apollo  a couple hours rack time does sound awfully sweet  tigh right about now adama you deserve it  thank you the truth is  all this has me feeling more alive than i have in years  you look that way too  its good to you without the cup in your hand  dont start  i know theres a whole lot of people aboard this ship  that wish you werent feeling as good as you were  if the crew doesnt hate the xo then hes not doing his job  besides got to make the old man look good  i always look good   did you look in a mirror  seriously  gaeta sir  its one thing to push a crew its another to break them    dradis contact bearing 348 carom 120 one ship  getting recognition signal  man initiating response flash mode alpha alpha  its the olympic carrier sir  adama is that confirmed dualla its confirmed sir    thank the gods    action stations    put the fleet into condition one  i want all vipers manned and ready but keep them in the tubes  tigh mr gaeta gaeta sir  restart the clock thirtythree minutes     hope youre wrong  so do i  gaeta clock is running adama so do i    no its all wrong  if they were left behind why didnt the cylons destroy them  and why are they showing up now  its gods punishment for your lack of faith  thats just great that is  a more logical and useful explanation please  all right  the olympic carrier has been infiltrated by cylon agents    theyve been tracking the ship all along  no  then that means  logically in order for you to survive  the olympic carrier should be destroyed  boomer olympic carrier  this is raptor 478 call sign boomer i have you in visual contact  please respond to this channel over  man raptor 478 this is the olympic carrier we have you in visual contact  thank the lords of kobol you dont know how relieved we are to see you  boomer roger that olympic carrier can i ask about your whereabouts  man we had trouble with our ftl drive took us almost three hours to fix  adama have boomer ask them how they escaped the cylons  boomer olympic carrier boomer  ive been directed to ask how you escaped from the cylons  man they were closing in on us when the rest of you were jumping  i thought we were goners then they just broke off  someone mustve been watching out for us  boomer roger that man one other thing boomer  ive got a dr amarak on board  who has an urgent matter to discuss with the president   hes been driving me crazy  can you be more specific  man i cant he says he knows something about a traitor in our midst  and hes unwilling to share more than that  madam president i strongly recommend  that we cut off all wireless communication with that ship right away  why  look forgive me for being rude but wake up all right  the olympic carrier is still flying because the cylons let them survive  theyve been tracking that ship all along   theres probably a cylon agent aboard now  calm down  start over  please madam president i implore you listen to me  cut off radio communication with that ship  before they send via broadcast signal another computer virus  to affect our ship shortly before they blow us all up  commander adama are you on the line  cut off the speakers put her through on the line  adama yes madam president and im inclined to agree with dr baltar  good so do i  thank the gods youre with us  gods got nothing to do with this      dualla boomer galactica  your orders are to jam all transmissions from the olympic carrier  no further voice contact is authorised  roger that galactica  dualla boomer galactica  orders are to send the olympic carrier the following message by signal light  message begins maintain present position  dualla do not repeat do not approach the fleet until further notice  message ends  im getting a bad feeling about where this is headed  so am i  if the ship poses a threat to us we have to eliminate that threat    i dont think they got the message apollo  yeah i see it boomer break wireless silence on my authority  warn them to stop their engines immediately  i suggest that we evacuate the passengers then destroy the ship  solves the problem if theyre tracking the ship  what if theyre tracking one of the passengers  boomer olympic carrier  you are ordered to stop your engines immediately acknowledge  boomer apollo theyre not responding apollo are you using the same channel  boomer yeah but suddenly nobodys home  starbuck fire a burst across their bow  copy that      boomer let galactica know we have a problem out here  commander message from boomer  the olympic carrier is heading directly for us sir  theyre refusing all orders to stop    boomer galactica theyre still not responding  and continue to head towards the fleet request instructions  order the fleet to execute jump 240 get us between that ship and the fleet  gaeta commander dradis contact strike that multiple dradis contacts    its the cylons    crashdown the cylons are on an intercept course  theyll be in weapons range within two minutes    radiological alarm   radiological alarm  from where    the olympic carrier sir theyve got nukes on board  madam president we have to eliminate the olympic carrier immediately  there are 1300 people on that ship  adama we dont know that the cylons may have captured them already  shes not going to do it she has to do it   its not her decision gaius  no  no 6 its gods choice he wants you to repent  look at this point theres no choice its either them or us  repent of your sins  and accept his true love and you will be saved    i repent then ill repent    i repent  do it  boomer we have new orders  were directed to destroy the olympic carrier  and return to galactica  its a civilian ship  apollo yeah a civilian ship with nukes    apollo i dont see anybody in there do you  the cylons will be here any second if were going to do this then just do it  starbuck form up with
