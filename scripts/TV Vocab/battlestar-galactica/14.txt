when we were aboard the base star  she left the raptor for a few minutes and came back without her helmet  she might have told the cylons everything our position defenses  kelly colonel the toasters have knocked out our co  this has gotta be part of a bigger plan  i recommend we execute jump to emergency standby coordinates  colonel ive located doc cottle hes aboard the rising star   gaeta dradis  single contact cylon base star bearing 487carom015  sir we cant stay here    sir  adama so whats your plan here  personally i tend to go with what you know  till something better turns up  kelly sir  dee alert the fleet  we are making an immediate jump to the emergency coordinates  go  sir doc cottle is still  hell have to rejoin us on the other side of the jump  sir what about our people on the surface of kobol    if theyre still alive theyll have to wait  gaeta ftl  dualla go  navcon go  galactica to all vessels  prepare to make immediate ftl jump to escape coordinates alpha  i say again escape coordinates alpha  clock will start on my mark  mark    captain what have they done to you whats going on  my fathers been shot  what  someone get this frakking thing off me please  im not authorized to do that yet  im behind the frakking bars  captain  how bad is your father  bad  two bullets in the chest  is dr cottle with him  no doc cottles not on board  dualla attention galactica fleet is away  stand by to jump in five four  three two one  jump  gaeta jump completed  report  report  dradis is empty no contacts  no contacts wheres the fleet  dee  checking all channels  no colonial signals  theyre gone sir  no 6 isnt she beautiful gaius  i dont think ive ever been touched so deeply in my entire life  youre going to make a wonderful father  speaking metaphorically of course  and literally  shes our child gaius our little girl  what  do you want to hold her   yes yes of course i do  but shes not real  any more than  any of this is  real  shes real she is  she may not be with you yet but she will be  soon  im having a little difficulty  im trying to understand i want to understand i  youre the mother  and youre the father  am i the father  excuse me  dream  im clearly having a dream  were moving out sir get up    and if you wouldnt mind carrying something this time that would be great    this is serisone it should help you breathe a little easier      tyrol take it easy  youll be up feeling better in a few minutes  excuse me sir  weve got to get you up  crewman specialist socinus it hurts i know  if you dont mind me asking where are we going crashdown  tree line we can hide  but still see the crash site in case galactica sends a rescue party  galactica will be sending a rescue party    crashdown everybody down  cally what was that that cylons  seelix grab the ammo staggered formation ill take point  chief youre bringing up the rear  be ready to doubletime it people one two three  eltee i think we should doublecheck the supplies before we bug out  sorry chief we dont have the time  if thats an aircraft turbine theyre gonna be on us any moment  eltee weve gotta make sure we have everything  we dont have the time chief  damn it  gods damn it  whats going on saul wheres the fleet  we dont know they jumped to another location  youve got blood on your pants why would they do that  every watch we update our emergency jump calculations  with new star fixes  to compensate for inertial drift  and then we transmit them to the rest of the fleet  this time ours were updated but theirs werent  gaeta was supposed to transmit them to the rest of the fleet  so its gaetas fault  the kid was overwhelmed he had his hands full  if you say so it sounds like a pretty big screwup to me  i should have checked before i gave the order to jump  this doesnt sound like you saul you dont let people slide  you bust their ass  now if bill doesnt make it  hell make it  if he doesnt this will be your ship your command  all im saying is you need to be this is bill adamas ship  this is his command  his orders are still the word of the gods on this ship  just so were clear  this will be adamas command until the day he dies  and we are not going to let him die  so say we all  all so say we all  as you were  so how do we find the fleet  if we jump back to our original coordinates  our nav computers can use those star fixes to generate a bestfit solution  giving the fleets current position  the cylons are waiting for us back there  how long will it take to calculate once we get back there  if we shut down all other functions   theres no way we can hold off a cylon base star for 12 hours  we have got to jump back we cant stay here  lt thrace wont be able to find us once she retrieves the arrow from caprica  if she retrieves the arrow shell retrieve the arrow  captain youve got to get reinstated youve got to get back to clc  youve got to denounce me disavow me do whatever you need to do  col tigh cannot relocate this fleet on his
