tortured  i know a place where you can stay  where you will be safe  where i can look after you  vice president baltar offered the contents of this case as proof of his sincerity  a nuclear bomb  im afraid that i have no alternative  but to announce that i am as of now a candidate for the presidency  what should be important to you personally is that roslins up three points in the polls  i am picking up a large planetary body  you know what this is  its habitable  we may have just found a world that can support human life  we needed an issue  something to set us apart from roslin  this  is it  permanent settlement on this planet  what took you so long  we got marines and raptors  were gonna get you and your people out of here okay  incoming  season 2  episode 20 lay down your burdens

theyre gonna lob some gas in here and then well all wake up somewhere else  damn  so what do you want to do here  sit it out  wait and see if shes right  if she is then you and me we gotta have an agreement  an agreement  not going back to one of those farms sam  im not  so if shes right  and they throw gas in here  you do me i do you  what are you talking about  this is what im talking about okay  yeah okay  okay  down two more points and this after hearing his notions of social policy  not to mention his wishful thinking that he is calling security policy  are people really going to be that stupid  are they really going to be that shortsighted  hes got the only issue people care about  oh i know the planet thats all anybody wants to talk about is that frackin planet  excuse my  my language tory im sorry  i know in my gut that settling on this planets gonna mean disaster  for humanity and i will not say otherwise just to win an election  as you wish madam president  so i guess i should start packing up my office unless you have some super secret  theres always a backup plan  for victory  just in time for the priest  oh good send him in  eighteen hours  theyre taking their good sweet time out there  they couldve overrun us at any point during the night  theyre up to something  what are we up to  got any brilliant ideas in that military brain of yours  do the same thing we always do  fight em till we cant  what do you think  lets get a recon crew together  scout the area  figure out whats going on out there  theyre gone  they just left  thank the gods  its a miracle  let us pray  lords of kobol  we trust in your benevolence and praise your righteousness  give the people of this fleet  the wisdom to see the goodness  and the strength of your servant laura roslin  amen  admiral  madam president  the admirals not here  this is my meeting  i wanted us to talk privately without the press getting wind of it  please have a seat  well you must have something very interesting to say to resort to such  pedestrian methods of deception  the question of permanent settlement  may well be the most important issue we face since the attack  i agree  good  the question should be carefully studied before making a final decision  the question should be carefully studied before making a final decision  in the middle of an election campaign is hardly the time for careful study  therefore i propose a truce  you and i will issue a joint statement declaring  that the question be tabled till after this election  we will both pledge that regardless of who is elected  the decision will be made only after careful deliberation  involving all elements of the public  and after consultation with the military and the quorum of twelve  doctor  i know weve had our disagreements  but this issue  transcends personal disagreement as well as politics  i am appealing here to your sense of patriotism  let me tell you my sense of patriotism is doing just fine  thank you very much for asking  i see it as my patriotic duty  to lead this fleet to a new world  that new world is unquestionably new caprica  but thank you madam president  for demonstrating to me  just how desperate your campaign for reelection has become  were you with a blond woman on caprica just prior to the attack    a what   she knows  were you  with a tall  blond woman  in the river walk section of caprica city  just prior to the attack   she can see right through you get out of here now  youll resort to anything at this stage wont you   im afraid my affairs on caprica and who i chose to consort with  are none of your business  i saved your life  i wont save your political career   we are not moving down to that planet  if baltar wins the election   baltar wont win the godsdamn  if he does then what   were going to just sit on this ship and rot while everyone else   gets to start a new life   my jobs to protect the fleet  from the cylons and thats what ill be doing  if you want

frackking cylon im not  well  okay then  sorry to bust up your day brother but theres been a change of plans  its been decided that the occupation of the colonies was an error  i couldve told them that bad thinking faulty logic   our first major error of judgment  live and learn  but the war heroes have managed to swing opinion over to their side   what heroes   a six and an eight  one of the eights you know as sharon valerii  their voices carry a lot of weight  so when they started talking about our mistakes and our corruption and  our need for a new beginning   the rest of us listened  you see were not like you  we can admit our mistakes and were not afraid of change  so you abandoned the colonies  leaving behind a devastated nuclear wasteland  and were supposed to be grateful  our pursuit of this fleet of yours was another error  thats two for anyone whos keeping score  both errors led to the same result  we became what we beheld  we became you  amen  people should be true to who and what they are  were machines we should be true to that  be the best machines the universe has ever seen  but we got it into our heads that we were the children of humanity  so instead of persuing our own destiny  of trying to find our own path to enlightenment   we hijacked yours  you said it brother  my mission here is simple  im to tell you that youve been given a reprieve  cylon and man will now go their separate ways  no harm done  no harm  you completely annihilated our race and destroyed our civilization  now if you going to start pointing fingers  where did the cylons go  back to their home world   well id rather not say just now  lets just say we have other plans  new marching orders by your one true god  there is no god  supernatural divinities are the primitives answer  for why the sun goes down at night  at least thats what weve been telling the others for years  cant really prove it one way or the other of course  i know a way to prove it  throw them both out the air lock let them see if there really is a cylon god  ballots from the adriatic d   all right this way  its been an exciting day  the election has been a real roller coaster ride  the polls now have been closed for about five hours  results have come in and its been a seesaw battle back and forth between  the presidential candidates all night long as we of course expected it would be  were still waiting for a few more numbers to come in now  from the counting room of galactica which  i must tell you as some of you may know was a source of a controversy yesterday  councilman zarek had filed a formal complaint against the  use of military military involvement in the election process  now its just reached a compromise was just reached  late yesterday allowing galactica to provide security for the balloting  as well as civilians to oversee and monitor the situation  yes okay we have some more votes coming in here  still not done but what we have so far is 6282 more votes for baltar  which puts his total now to   is that correct  and we also have roslin her total now is at   weve had 2981 more votes  come in for roslin at this time  so that is how things are looking at this point  well continue to bring you up to the minute coverage and the count progresses  yeah its me  is this a secure line   okay  there are only five ships left to report in  we need to move now  ill take care of it  lieutenant  ill be right back   are those the ballots from the zephyr   yes sir  all right well take it from here  we were told to take these to the ballot room sir  counting has already begun well take it from here  last one  we have some more results have come in here now   which puts her over the top  thats 24 265 for laura roslin  is that correct   and 22 366 for gaius baltar  were going to check these again because that has put her over the top she has done it  she has retained the presidency in an improbable comeback  in the final hours of the campaign  again we would of course like to check those numbers if we could  but it appears that laura roslin has retained the presidency  in defiance of the polls the pundits and the surveyors of gloom and doom  ive never seen a political race end like this but it has just happened  i am james mcmanus well check those numbers and well be back to you very shortly  thank you  ive seen a lot of elections gaius  most honest a few fixed  and you can always tell the fixed ones because they dont make sense  and this doesnt make sense  laura roslin is many things  but shes not corrupt  and shes not dishonest  its over  congratulations madam president  thank you  i hope you dont take this the wrong way but  are you as shocked as i am   im relieved  well you dont sound it  im just tired  its been a long campaign  colonel may i speak to you for a moment   whats up   sir im afraid these ballots from the zephyr are wrong  what the hell are you talking about   doctor baltars name is spelled correctly on these ballots  but this morning the zephyr called me  and told me their ballots had a misprint they misspelled baltars first name  we didnt have time to print new ballots so  i told them on my authority to go ahead and use them anyway  baltars name is spelled correctly here  so they couldnt have come from the zephyr theyre frauds  now theres a complete chain of custody  from the zephyr all the way into this room so someone in the chain is either  a perpetrator or at least a willing ally  thank you for bringing this to my attention ill take care of it from here  sir  we should at least notify the civilian observers and the press that these ballots  i said ill take care of it from here  yes sir  madam president you should celebrate  its a great victory and youve earned it  excuse me  admiral well talk later thank you   adama  yes sir this is lieutenant geata  sir   i dont know how to say this  fast and straight id advise  yes sir  admiral i believe that colonel tigh is involved in a conspiracy  to rig the election for president roslin  when i confronted the colonel he admitted his guilt  he said he acted in collusion with your  campaign manager tory foster  saul said tory contacted him a few days ago  he did it because he felt that baltar as president would be a disaster  i said i agreed  but that what he had done was illegal   a judicial tribunal may have to be convened  stop  i gave tory the go ahead  i didnt know exactly what she was planning  i certainly did not know about colonel tigh oh my gods  but i did know that she was planning to fix the vote  you tried to steal an election   yes i did  and i got caught  but gaius baltar  cannot become president of the colonies  bill it cannot happen  laura   i dont want him as president either  hes working with the cylons  i saw him  just before the attack in caprica  with a copy of the tall blond cylon woman  the same model who accused baltar of treason  before disappearing from galactica  what the hell are you saying   why didnt you say something before this   because i didnt remember seeing him with that woman  until i remembered it when i was dying  i know how that sounds but its real  the same way kobol is real  and the tomb of athena is real  and the map to earth is real  baltar is working with the cylons  even if thats true you have no proof  no i dont  do we steal the results of a democratic election or not   thats the decision because  if we do this were criminals  unindicted maybe  but criminals just the same  yes we are  you wont do it  weve gone this far   but thats it  scuse me   you try to steal this election youll die inside  likely move your cancer right to your heart  the people made their choice  were gonna have to live with it  its the wrong choice  yes it is  all right all right all right  so thats it  we just give it up just like that  the battle perhaps  but not the war  well the important thing is the error was discovered and corrected  youve been elected president congratulations  thank you very much admiral  now about this error  exactly what kind of a tabulating error could have occurred on your ship  that couldve swung several thousand votes away from me  in favor of your preferred candidate admiral   as soon as i have the time there will be an investigation  i suggest that you take your victory  and you leave it at that doctor  i think youll find i can be magnanimous in victory admiral  and i believe the correct honorific at this time is mr president elect  set a course for new caprica  jump completed we are in orbit around new caprica  we have all ships present and accounted for sir  send word to the pegasus  to launch their initial ground team onto the surface  lets get a good look at our new home  gods help us all  well  well  well  i think my ability to see you will  no doubt be  constrained by the responsibilities and the  requirements of my new position  listen to me  mymy new position  but obviously  we  we will have the chance to connect to  to get together again   on new caprica once  im not going to new caprica  what  what are you talking about  im not going to new caprica  were all going  to new caprica  all of us  every last single one of us  its our chance to be together  to be together again  no  i cant do this anymore  stay  if youll raise your right hand and repeat after me  i gaius baltar do now avow and affirm  i gaius baltar do now avow and affirm  that i take the office of the president of the twelve colonies of kobol  without any moral reservation or mental evasion  that i take the office of president of the twelve colonies of kobol  without any moral reservation or mental evasion  that i will protect and defend the articles of colonization  that i will protect and defend the articles of colonization   with every fiber of my being  with every fiber of my being   congratulations mr president  thank you  i accept the role offered to me by the colonies  with humility and gratitude  thank you  thank you wait wait no waitand now   because it was the first will of the people  im going to sign my first executive order  requiring  immediately establish settlements  on the planet we have come to know  as new caprica  you have your olders  we suspect the warhead was stolen from your lab  then smuggled aboard cloud 9 by a cylon agent  i dont suppose i could interest you in a cup of tea  non compris dans le transcript  president  this may be the first step  in a coordinated cylon attack  i suggest our first priority would be to focus in on internal security  no  no i dont think so  our first priority is to the people  see that they are safely established  on new caprica  once thats accomplished  we can put this tragedy behind us  youre not listening  i dont have to listen  im the president  the settlement begins and it begins now  mr president  president baltar good morning sir  good morning sir  mr president the union needs their
