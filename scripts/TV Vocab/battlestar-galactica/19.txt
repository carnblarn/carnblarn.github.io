                male narrator previously on battlestar galactica  deep down in that thing you call a subconscious  you know how many cylons there are left in the fleet  eight there are eight  cpl venner reports the former presidents missing  missing two men down cells empty  damn it  zarek glad to see you madam president  well mr zarek it would seem the enemy of my enemy is my friend  go find her  lets go home    roslin we have found kobol  and when we retrieve the arrow we will open the tomb of athena  and we will find the road to earth  no ones gonna believe this crap  and anyone that wants to make a suicide run to kobol let them  astral queen has jumped away  gaeta twentyfour ships sir  thats almost a third of the fleet  theyre gonna follow roslin to kobol to their death    dualla aboard the 24 ships  that joined former president roslins rebellion sir  tigh thats over a third of the people in the fleet  give me a breakdown what have we lost  dualla  not who what  im not interested in people who decide to join up  with a religious fanatic and a terrorist  thats their business now what have i lost   twelve transports seven freighters  three construction platforms  a private cruiser and a mining ship sir  the monarch was a blow  we cant afford to lose mining ships not in our situation  and then theres the collateral damage  morale is down throughout the fleet  the press is going wild families are being split apart  dont talk to me about family  apollo i support the president completely  and my only priorities are the preservation of her safety  and the completion of this mission  thats all well and good but hes still adamas son man 1 yeah  woman yes when push comes to shove  how do we know hell be willing to stand up  if it were not for him i would still be in a galactica jail cell  i trust him completely and this subject is closed  and what about galactica  they know where we are  they could jump in here at any time and charge us all with treason  or destroy this ship with a flick of the wrist  zarek were not entirely defenseless   some of our ships are armed  we should take steps to arm the others just in case   just in case we want to commit suicide  if galactica wants to take us down there is nothing we can do about it  nothing  and nobody in this room should be under any illusions on that count  at this point its my firm belief that cdr adama has let us go  lt thrace will return  she will have the arrow of apollo  and it will help us find our way to earth  and exactly how long should we wait for her  i mean maybe we should go down to the surface now  go down now and start looking for this tomb  i wouldnt be too eager there may still be cylons present  and some of us will die down there  the scriptures tell us that any return to kobol  carries with it a cost  in blood  roslin people  i realize that there are still many   unanswered questions here  but i refuse to lose sight of what   this has always been about  our mission to save humanity  yes its a big one  but it is our foretold destiny  and l for one am not going to waver from it now  roslin if there is anyone here  who does not have the stomach for this mission  you are welcome to rejoin cdr adamas fleet        it jumped into dradis range about two minutes ago  no colonial transponder and its too large to be thraces cylon raider  and no response to our hails  meier not a peep tom   its either a cylon vessel  or its a raptor scout from galactica  either way we should shoot first and ask questions later  okay  the adriatic is in weapons range and shes got shiptoship missiles  tom that thing is moving fast if were   gonna shoot it down we better shoot it down  shoot what down  do i have to repeat myself  madam president we have a security situation thats all  she wasnt talking to you  theres an unidentified ship making its way towards us  zarek its too big to be the lieutenants cylon raider  its in weapons range the adriatic has to fire her missiles now  we need a decision madam president  starbuck on radio civilian vessels civilian vessels  this is starbuck do you read   do you read say again this is starbuck

congratulations captain  its you  thank you sir  i just want you to know you have total support of myself and this entire crew  is that not right colonel  absolutely  heres your log book congratulations  im honored commander i wont let you down  and sir id just like to say that i was a tremendous supporter of your son  capt adama he was a great leader sir  a ship is a family  it works

george im sure youll do a fine job  what the hell you got me in here jawing about picking a new cag  and youve already made your choice  i just wanted to see if you and i were on the same page or not  i beg your pardon  i guess were not  you guessed right youre telling me that kid is leadership material  we have very few choices and hes the best  hes a good man saul hes honest and hes loyal  we need a little bit of that around here right now    well its your call ill support it    commander  all cdr adama      can you tell us about  can you make any comments regarding laura roslin   please be seated  this thing working please be seated  lady reporter will you be finally addressing those issues    lady reporter commander will you be responding  allow me to make a statement please  please allow me to make a statement please be seated  thank you very much  if you dont already know the fleet has been divided    adama wait  we share the grief of friends lost  and the resources weve sacrificed  will present new challenges for all of us  but if we stay together  we will rise to the occasion as we have before    questions  all here  yes  do you know the coordinates  the whereabouts of president roslins rebellion  do you intend to put the fleet back together  first of all laura roslin is no longer president  she relinquished that role when she suborned mutiny aboard this ship  next question  but commander commander  yes go ahead  man since the fleet has been divided  commander you havent answered my question yet  we have lost no one that cannot be replaced by someone loyal  who has chosen to remain with us  this is the fleet  thank you  this is the fleet male reporter commander commander  is there any truth to the rumor that there is no earth  it doesnt exist and you just made it up  what the hell kind of question is that  its been all over talk wireless newsletter circuit hand mail  freedom of the press is not a license to slander  broadcasting that kind of garbage  is the quickest way to find yourself in a holding cell  that goes for all of you  tigh were done here    get your hands off me   why dont you calm down  remind me not to do that again  always looked easy enough when roslin did it  there was an old footbridge over the euclid river  i used to go there when i was a boy  watch the fish try and swim upstream  they were mesmerizing  i envied them  unaware as they were of the  wider complexities challenges of life  youre beginning to see human beings as we see them  what i am beginning to see are cylon faces everywhere i look  sharon told me there were eight cylons left in the fleet  why didnt i ask her who they were  if that idiot hadnt shot her  and why is it when things go wrong they go wrong so well  gaius you get yourself far far too worked up about these things    they do have it easy dont they  they  why are you talking to me like im not one of them  in some ways you never were  you have a path you will be spared their fate  for once gaius you can stop manipulating the world and let destiny take its course  if theres one thing we know about human beings with certainty  they are masters of selfdestruction  because i love him  and because im carrying his child  oh i see that explains it  youre not here because you mean us any harm  or because youre a programmed enemy of humanity  youre here because you had an affair with one of our raptor pilots  listen to me im listening to you  thats my mistake im listening to a cylon  i am here because i chose to come here  and i know you dont believe me  but hear this even if you find the tomb  even if you find the map and even if you find earth  the price you pay will be too high  im not interested in your prophecies  i know that there is a cylon force on kobol i know its dangerous  and i have little doubt that you are communicating everything i say  even as we speak it doesnt work like that im not wired in  sharon its simple  what i need to know and what might keep you alive  is exactly how to find the tomb of athena  get me a map  and i will do my best to tell you how to get to the tomb  no youll do better than your best  i want to know where it is and you either know or you dont  we all know about the tomb  i can show you the path  i dont know how long the path is or exactly where it leads to  but i can tell you that youre gonna have to move very very quickly  she claims to love lt agathon  she says she loves the baby shes carrying  who cares what she says  you cant believe a word any of them  the scrolls of pythia do speak of a lower demon  who helped the people in a time of crisis  more superstition  ive told her that unless we return from kobol with a map to earth  that lt agathon will be put out the airlock as a cylon conspirator  is that true  doesnt matter if its true she believed it  she saved them both of them she didnt have to  she couldve saved her child and let them die why didnt she  because i believe that shes telling the truth about one thing  she thinks shes in love  even if its software instead of an emotion its real to her  she wants her baby to live she wants agathon to live  we use that  this is not the way that i thought things were gonna go down  i knew theyd be suspicious but  theyre human  the way you are  meier has anyone stopped to consider  that the reason sharon knows so much about kobol is because its a cylon trap  ive done more than consider it it is clearly possible were facing a trap  capt apollo has already warned us that cylon encounter in the region is probable  has capt apollo managed to tell us anything we dont already know  he is in charge of this mission he is second in command only to myself  i strongly encourage you to remember that mr meier  whatever the risks whatever the consequences i am going anyway  i am committed  dualla on radio capt birch galactica  youre cleared for target exercise maneuvers acknowledge  birch on radio galactica leader wilco  cag to all vipers  were initiating our precisionfiring exercise as planned  hotdog youre first up kat on deck  hotdog on radio leader hotdog  cleared to target executing eyeball run  on three two one away    hotdog frak winged it  birch come on people i know this is just a drill  but lets look sharp out there  hotdog i know you can do a lot better lets try it again  see if you can put the next one in the xring  cleared hot   ready for another pass  leader kat im confirming that im cleared for my attack run      am i clear    executing eyeball run  affirmative youre clear   rolling in weapons hot  kat leader

galactica  frak  i know how you feel i get it  but i didnt shoot him okay it wasnt me  youre all the same  you dont know what the hell youre talking about  then maybe im done talking  i think theres been enough of that today  you are the last one that should be telling me what to do  after the stunt you pulled  stealing the cylon raider and then tearing ass back to caprica  yeah i guess youre clearly the poster boy for military discipline huh  you know what you have no idea what happened to me on caprica  so while youre standing here polishing off your halo consider for a second  that you may not have any damned idea what the hell youre talking about  captain  meier what roslins doing is reckless  we have our own fleet now how much longer  do we need to keep playing follow the leader  we have a fleet because people believe roslins going to lead them to earth  shes a fraud  you dont believe her do you  no but i believe in the power of myth  im not interested in risking our lives any more than you are  but shes clearly not gonna be talked out of this  and in the end president or prophet it doesnt really matter  she still needs a commander a man in charge of the fleet  the man with the guns makes the rules  what if she decides youre not the man to be in charge of the fleet  what if she has someone else in mind  someone already close to her like a certain captain  lets say youre right that on some level  based on their belief in the scriptures  the fleet needs laura roslin in order to stay in line  so we do what we must in order to keep roslin safe on the surface of kobol  but  but  youre right  youre absolutely right  how could i have not have seen that  i want to set this fleet on a path to freedom  of course  i want to deliver unto them the liberty weve promised  we are far from daylight my friend  the scriptures say some of us will die on kobol  one man in particular  birch tank to striker  your approach is a little off the center line  striker reset your delta to 035 acknowledge  striker striker hows my approach speed  birch tanker to striker  your angle vectors are too steep for junct  i repeat your angle vectors are too steep for junct  striker tanker request heading onetenth of the way  what is he doing  birch this is tanker tell him to cut his speed    what is it this time im glad youre here  birch is coordinating the ships for refueling  but hes making a mess out of what should be the simplest op in the book  how long has he been at it  about four hours now  sir hes too green  hes blowing the approach and the docking speeds  hes missing the drogues hes bunching the lines its a mess out there  as you know this isnt the first screwup  yes i know  i realize that he is your guy    but hes no apollo  striker moving on 709  i was wondering

gonna end one way or another  we find the tomb or we dont we find a way to earth or we dont  i just want you to know kara that im your friend i love you  if theres anything you want to talk about  anything you wanna get off your chest then im here for you  anyway whenever you wanna talk just let me know  what was that middle part again  what do you mean  did you say you love me  well lee adama

mmmhmm  okay  this is striker im having trouble getting a visual on the fueling spar  can you redirect  gas station strikers coming in way too hot  emmitt you gotta back off your delta like right now  striker roger that correcting approach angle  emmitt didnt you hear us back off your delta youre too close  are you listening  okay birch we are not too close  abort abort the op striker remain on target  recall the ships  galactica all ships involved in fuel unrep abort mission  say again abort fuel unrep raptors return to base acknowledge  birch wilco galactica aborting mission  damn it  birch roger that galactica says abort approach  attempt angle vector full reverse  striker youre still on a collision course  put your helm hard left full reverse thrusters back off  look out      emmitt galactica emmitt  tankers intact  no wireless contact but its in an axis spin and there does appear to be some damage  away rescue team tell them to board the tanker and restore navigational control  man away rescue team to section 046    here  you never know when you might need to defend yourself    here we go  and the blaze pursued them and the people of kobol had a choice  to board the great ship or take the high road through the rocky ridge  and the body of each tribes leader was offered to the gods  in the tomb of athena  yes precisely  and the great ship was a galleon that departed from here where were standing  and it took the founders of the 13 colonies to their destiny  and those that didnt board the galleon took the high road  the rocky ridge that led to the tomb  lets move    the path is supposed to be marked by gravestones  theres something there    wait        get back get back get back  helo sharon sharon take cover        switch  nice one ammo  here  lee no      you gotta be frakking kidding me  not bad  adama its interesting  betrayal has such a powerful grip on the mind  its almost like a python  it can squeeze out all other thought  suffocate all other emotion until  everything is dead except for the rage  im not talking about anger  im talking about rage  i can feel it right here  iike its gonna burst  i feel like i wanna scream  right now matter of fact  if i may say something  speak your mind dee  i dont think the problem is that youve been betrayed  i think its that you feel helpless  you were shot you were injured you couldnt do anything  dont make excuses for me  and when you finally had a chance to do something  im sorry i did this  you let us down    you let us down  you made a promise  to all of us  to find earth  to find us a home  together  it doesnt matter what the president did or even what lee did  because every day that we remain apart  is a day that youve broken your promise  people aboard those ships made their own decision  it was their decision not mine  thank you petty officer you may leave now  you asked to talk to me sir  maybe because you think that i dont have anything to say  but i do  its time to heal the wounds commander  people have been divided  i said thats enough  children are separated from their parents    a cost in blood  lets go madam president    adama mr gaeta  i want to see all recon material on kobol immediately in my quarters  aye sir  tigh kobol  yes  im putting the fleet back together  im putting our family back together  this ends now
