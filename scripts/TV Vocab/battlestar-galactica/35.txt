                credit      i can help you laura  in ways i cannot help myself  i can protect you  but you have to understand the situation has changed now  the insurgency has crossed the line  suicide bombings  its abhorrent  its contrary to everything that we believe in  so you  you and i we will uh  we will publicly condemn these tactics  they cannot be legitimized in any shape or form  theres something that scares the cylons after all  i should think using men and women as human bombs  should scare us all  desperate people take desperate measures  all right look me in the eye  look me in the eye and tell me that you approve  of sending young men and women  into crowded places  with explosives strapped to their chests  im waiting for you to look me in the eye  and tell me that you approve   and their only crime  was putting on the police uniform  trying to bring some order to the chaos out there  order  by arresting innocent people in the dead of night  detaining them indefinitely without charge  torturing them for information  nobodys been tortured  tell that to colonel tigh  nobody has been tortured  were done here  i hope you understand  the severity of the situation  id ask you to obey  the dictates of your conscience  which is what ive always done  of that i have no doubt  please give this lovely lady her shoes back  then get her out of here  man on pa curfew is now in effect  severe penalties will be imposed  on anyone found on the streets  curfew is now in effect  severe penalties will be imposed  on anyone found on the streets  i dont know about this  we need to make a point the violence must end  we got a job to do  what are we doing is that him  yeah just do what he asks  everything will be okay  you understand your orders captain  everything clear  yes sir good  dont worry we have your back  did you hear  the cylons cut food rations toady  we heard  how long before the next raptor transmission  two minutes  you know theyre taking about  shutting down the marketplace  its a security risk  well shift targets  you were gonna hit the marketplace  the market  full of civilians  this is crazy  you know we need to figure out  whose side were on  which side are we on  were on the side of the demons chief  were evil men in the gardens of paradise  sent by the forces of death  to spread devastation and destruction  wherever we go  im surprised you didnt know that  contact  theyre ready for the sitrep  send it twice just to make sure  here are the names of those to be arrested  and sent to detention  i uh  i know some of these people  im sure you do  theyre all insurgents jammer  we have to break the cycle of violence  okay suit up  you wont have to wear those much longer  eventually your people will see you as heroes  not tonight  take numbers five through ten  okay take the tents to the right  follow down the end  rest of you guys gotta keep quiet okay  this is new caprica police  youre under arrest for colluding with the insurgency  youre wanting for questioning in the graduation bomb  cally tyrol this is an ncp raid  no let go of me get your hands up  my baby no no my baby  no  hey hey hey no no no no  i got you i got you  yeah yeah yeah oh there you go  mommys coming back its okay  its okay its okay  their numbers are a little thin  it says here tigh commands  thats a lot less than he should have  if you count all former fleet officers  and enlisted available down there  could be taking heavy losses  they mentioned a cylon crackdown  we should get a breakdown of available pilots  in the insurgent group  somebodys gotta fly those ships off the ground  if were gonna pull this off  those ships arent going anywhere yet  the cylons have removed launch keys  from grounded colonial ships  location unknown  came from tyrol  can we manufacture new launch keys  forget it  the specs on launch keys are incredibly sophisticated  it would take weeks just to do the rd  best option is for saul  and the people on the ground  to find the original launch keys  assuming they werent destroyed  no no way  the cylons would want to keep them safe  just in case they needed to use  one of those ships someday  shes right  keys gotta still be there somewhere  we can make a weapons drop to the insurgents  they know the lay of the land  theyve been hitting the cylons  in the teeth for months  given them the tools they can kind the keys themselves  no no way  the only thing youve got going for you so far  is that the cylon reduced their defense perimeter  to just five baseships  you put heavy weaponry down there  theyre gonna know for sure  that were in contact with the population  call in ten more baseships  and then your whole plans frakked  funny thought this was our plan sir  moving on  the military plans that you have in your hands  are to be kept with you at all times  whyd they pick her up  she hasnt done anything  weve got a baby for gods sakes  i dont know ill try to find out  how long are they gonna hold her  detention is run by a separate ministry  they dont give us any reasons why they  godsdamn it felix  she hasnt done anything weve got a baby  i know galen  im sorry  how do you do it  how do you help them day after day  how do you look yourself in the mirror  i gotta get my son  camerons watching him  but shes got problems of her own  chief  ill see what i can do  ill see if theres something i can find out  yeah  why dont you try and do something  please no  no  hey you okay  jammer whats going on  yeah  yeah im okay chief  all right hey uh  i heard about last night  shh what  about cally being on one of those lists  yeah im really sorry  yeah frakkin human police huh  bunch of traitors if you ask me  some of those guys who joined up  i bet theyre in over their heads you know  especially now with these suicide bombings and  at first i bet you they thought  they were doing something good  you know get the cylons off the streets  let us police our own  theyre a bunch of frakkin idiots  what did they expect  you dont know any of those guys do you  any names  names no  nno idea  damn  well whats up with cally  why did they put her in detention  i dont know  she hasnt done a gods damn thing  i just talked to gaeta  says he doesnt know squat  or so he says  gaetas a good guy  if he knows something  hes a frakkin collaborator  you know what  one day when this is all over  guys like gaeta are gonna get strung up  and guys like you and me  were gonna be there tying the knots  making em tight  its been a couple of ugly days  i know you dont care about that but  life means something to us  so ive decided to show you  just how precious life can be  how even in the worst of times  it can restore your faith  remember that breeding farm on caprica  i remember i blew the frak out of the place  it wasnt a total loss  we were able to salvage certain things  certain medical samples  like your ovary  whats that  this is kacey  kacey this is kara  your mother  hi  good girl  unbelievable  what  admirals decided to put some boots on the ground  wants to send an officer  as a liaison between us  and the resistance elements on the planet  to coordinate the rescue op  makes sense whats the problem  its who hes sending  hes frakking kidding with this right  i wish he were  mr hoshi i want a raptor  prepped and ready in five minutes on the hangar deck  inform the flagship im coming aboard  i want a private meeting with the admiral  hoshi aye sir  what are you gonna do  what i shouldve done a long time ago  you cant do this  shes a cylon  well i trust her  well thats a mistake  well itll be my mistake wont it  you are gambling with the lives  of everyone on this ship  and everyone on my ship  i dont need a lecture from you  about the responsibilities of command  were done here  im not finished  this entire plan is a reckless gamble  and yes you certainly have the right  to risk the lives of the men and women under your command  but thats not the issue  the issue is that you are risking the lives  of the entire human race  im trying to save the human race  no no youre not thats what youre not seeing  right now the human race  well thats the 2000 people  huddled in those civilian ships  that managed to get away when the cylons came back  theyre the safe bet  theyre the ones whose survival we should guard  just like we did after the attack on the colonies  sharon can penetrate the lon defenses  its not about her  the centurio cant distinguish her  fromhe other humanoid models  did you know tha admiral  they were deliberately programmed that way  the cyns didnt want them becoming selfaware  and suddenly resisting orders  they didnt want their own  robotic rebellion on their hands  you can appreciate the irony  dad  i know what youre sayin  but we have a reonsibility  remember what roslin sd  our first responsibility is to the survival of humanity  we cant lose sight of that  over t last year  weelost sight  of almost everything  we gsoft  t if we go back to new caprica now  and we lose  its over  humanity just stops  and an admiral stars dont give you the right  to make that gamble  youre right son  you should make plans to resume the search for earth  with the pegasus and the civilian fleet  with pegasus what about lactica  i know why we left those people behind  and i know it was their choice  in the first placeto be d  and i realize  that the survival of the human race  outweighs anything else  but this time  i cant live with it  cant face it  maybe im a coward  but im going back  dad you wont have a chance  im going back son  leoben once i fertilized your egg  we transferred it to a human woman  who carried it to term  she was pretty funny  great smile  you wouldve liked her  although her birth mother died during childbirth  kaceys heart never faltered  i guess she gets that will to live from you  ive seen her path  its difficult but rewarding  shell know the mind of god in this lifetime  shell see patterns that others do not see  she probably got such spiritual clarity from me  shell be hungry soon  theres food on the table  you wouldnt let your own child starve would you  its not my child  i dont even know if its human  halfhuman  and you know that shes yours  you just wont admit it  where the frak you going  take this with you  hey  dont leave me alone with this  frak  i dont know who or what you are  but i do know thisim not your mother  i dont care that its effective  i dont care that the cylons cant stop it  its wrong  no more suicide bombings colonel  you understand  what are you working for the cylons now  im sorry theres no excuse for that  you see little things like that  they dont matter anymore  in fact not too frakking much really matters anymore  ive got one job here lady and one job only  to disrupt the cylons  make them worry about the anthill  theyve stirred up down here  so theyre distracted and out of position  when the old man shows up in orbit  the bombings they got the cylons attention  they really got their attention  and i am not giving that up  roslin we are talking about people blowing themselves up  you know sometimes i think  that youve got ice water in those veins  and other times i think  youre just a naive little schoolteacher  ive sent men  on suicide missions in two wars now  and let me tell you something  it dont make a godsdamn bit of difference  whether theyre riding in a viper  or walking out onto a parade ground  in the end theyre just as dead  so take your piety and your moralizing  and your highminded principles  and stick em someplace safe  until youre off this rock  and youre sitting in your nice cushy chair  on colonial one again  ive got a war to fight  the detentions are just causing more resentment  and more enemies  were losing ground with the people  caprica six i know  we dont have another option  we have to send the message  that suicide bombings wont be tolerated  excuse me sir can i talk to you for a moment  yeah sure jammer  ill catch up with you okay  sharon i dont know exactly how to broach this  nor do i know exactly what i expect you to do about it  but um i thought you know  since we were  anyway since we were back on the galactica  yeah jammer just spit it out  we picked up chief tyrols wife in the last raid  cally shes in detention  i think shes on a list  frak  mommy  kacey  kara  hi cally  its me boomer  i wish i had a gun  are you all right physically i mean  what do you want from me  look a lots happened  in everyones life  but i want you to know  i want you and galen to know  that im happy for you  especially since you started a family  something that him and i talked about once before  can you get me out of here  i dont know  i have nothing to do with internal security  then frak you sharon  you stupid frakkedup toaster  how many times do i have to shoot you anyway  if you cant help me then just go away  and leave us alone  all human personnel  prepare to present identification  before passing through security scanner  have your ids out  everyone have their work ids ready  work ids out  you  open your bag  stop her    they had casualties too  four human dead  who gives a frak about that pardon my language  you said it brother  the power substation was crippled  almost half the citys without power  and our best estimates put the repairs at two weeks  do you still think were being too hard  on the human population  we have a very serious very straightforward problem  either we increase control or we lose control  thats a fact  we think its time for stronger measures  we agree  we agree  we agree as well how about you  we agree also  most of us do anyway  enough  whats this  this orders the summary executions  of all the detainees listed on the next page  it requires your signature  my signature  youre the president  read it later sign now  just because youve decided to do this  doesnt mean you need to drag him into sin with you  dont you lecture me about sin  im not the one who committed the first act  of cylon on cylon violence in our history  whats she talking about  she crushed my head in with a rock back on caprica  interesting she didnt tell you  its something i had to do im not proud of it  this is all very interesting very edifying  sign the order  you dont need my signature  well actually we do  were here as allies and friends  of the legitimate government of the colonies  you are the president  so everything we do requires your signature  in other words theyre worried about  what god might think if they commit murder  theyre covering their existential asses  i wont do it  all right i wont do it  youre going to have to salve your consciences  some other way  then well find another president  stop this  this is crazy  dear god  shell be back  but if he pulls that trigger now you wont  sign it  sign it  sign your name sign it  sign it  theres nothing you can do gaius  itll be okay  its you  help me  you have to sign it  theyll kill you if you dont  sign it sign it sign it  sign your name sign it  i cant i wont  you cant force  sometimes you have to do things you hate  so you can survive to fight another day  raise your right hand and repeat after me  i sharon agathon  i sharon agathon  do now pledge my faith and my loyalty  do now pledge my faith and my loyalty  to the protection of the 12 colonies of kobol  to the protection of the 12 colonies of kobol  and will carry out the lawful orders of my superiors  and will carry out the lawful orders of my superiors  as an officer  as an officer  in the colonial fleet  in the colonial fleet  congratulations lieutenant  never thought id live to see the day  me neither  looks good on you  belongs on you  you know what this means to me  one of the first things they taught us at the academy  was that symbols matter  uniforms flags banners even mascots  theyre like pieces of your heart you can look at  this uniform  it means a lot to me sharon  i know it does helo  it means a lot to me too  i wont betray it  thanks  can i ask you a question  how do you know  i mean how do you really know that you can trust me  i dont  thats what trust is  good hunting lieutenant  that was really something  thought you might like that  you didnt do the twist this time  what do you callwhats that deal you did right at the end  what do you call that  you mean the swirl  oh the swirl  boy thats really something  well you said you wanted something memorable  how is saul  fine  whens his next meeting with the insurgents  no point in denying it ellen  we know hes their leader  why do you think we let him out of detention  i thought it was because of the twist  well yes that too for sure  but having the colonel out and active with the resistance  presents us with certain advantages  i dont know anything about  lets just consider your denials as read shall we  i want a specific place  and i want a specific time  for a very high level meeting of the insurgency leadership  and if i dont get it we pick up saul again  tomorrow the galactica is going to send  two raptors several marines  and a ground liaison officer is gonna brief us  on the rescue mission and help coordinate our evac plans  ill be damned its really happening  whos the liaison officer  sharon  i hope thats your idea of a joke  admiral adama has given her a uniform and a billet  she is a serving officer  which is more than you can say about us  technically speaking  the old mans lost his mind all right  wheres the rendezvous  they left that up to us  okay heres my suggestion  if they jump into breeders canyon  out here in the southern range  come  hi guys  hey ellen  anyway like i was saying  if they jump in here  they wont get picked up on cylon dradis  thats a long way out there  a lot of ground to cover by foot  i realize that  im gonna meet them halfway right about here  now theres good cover from the air  its pretty isolated  gotta be sure  may be the most important meeting  were ever gonna have  colonel im sure this is the place  the cylons will not find them here  all right give me the map  you got the message memorized  all the wireless freqs yes sir  well then give me the message too  ill do that saul  dont get up  thanks  colonel ive assembled a team  of about six to eight men and women

kill any of them correct  right well we made a decision  all of us  just like when we listened to you  and caprica six when we came here  to start this new and glorious chapter  in cylonhuman relations  this has nothing to do with whether or not  we execute cally  no one enjoys the thought of mortal death boomer  but she tried to murder you  maybe its gods justice  need a lift mr vice president  guess so  havent seen much of you lately  been busy these days  well not much to do in detention  how long have you been held  four months i think  i told baltar i wouldnt have  any part of
