                narrator previously on battlestar galactica    zak failed basic flight  and i should have flunked him but i didnt  the bottom line is that i killed him  walk out of this cabin while you still can  helo i dont get it  how does a military coded signal end up coming from in here    helo food  gaeta its the cylons  starbucks wireless and transponder just cut out  tigh starbucks gonna take on all eight  and get herself killed    boomer galactica hot dogs aboard helo yeah so is his lunch  take it easy hot dog youre not the first to lose it in combat  helo you wont be the last  no sign of starbuck  he says she was hit but still in the fight when he lost track of her  dualla roger that search and rescue ops are underway for starbuck  bring hot dog in the old man wants to talk to him  adama this is where you found him  yes sir he drifted quite a ways from the fight  adama was she manoeuvring hot dog i think so yes yes sir  so she survived the initial hits she could still be alive  she is alive lieutenant were gonna find her  boomer yes sir  adama get this man to sick bay apollo yes sir  i think you earned those today  the auxiliary rt switch sticks a little sir but shell fly   polish up the canopy i want it crystal clear  yes sir   find her  i will                gaeta still no joy from the search teams  in the last four hours weve combed everywhere  in a 200 click sphere around starbucks last known position  no ship no ejection seat no debris so were extending the radius another 50   we need more pilots  everybody who can fly is up sir  what about starbucks course computations  the variables of combat manoeuvring make them almost meaningless   its time to start guessing  yes sir  since theres been no dradis contact in the area  i would have to guess that her viper was captured by the gravity of a planetary body  the only nearby gravity wells are the gas giant and this moon  if the gas giant pulled her in its radiation would fry her like an egg  what about the moon  the spectroscope people call the atmosphere as co2 methane some argon  the clouds are mostly hydrocarbons  gaeta cold as hell down there but shed survive on the surface   until her oxygen runs out  when  gaeta fortysix hours and change sir  hell of a long time to stay in one place   what if the cylons appear  they wont not for a while  what makes you say that  sending a patrol instead of the base ship tells me they didnt even know we were here  so theyre searching a lot of other places places with potential supplies  like staking out water holes in the desert  if we sent eight fighters to search an entire star system  for 60odd ships it would take us weeks  assume theyre better and faster itll take them days   a lot of assumptions youre making  educated guess   talk to me about searching the moon  thats going to be slow going  we cant see squat through those clouds  send the ships below the cloud cover  tell the pilots to take a hard look the oldfashioned way  mark one eyeball sir  mark one eyeball  commander call from colonial one  adama  commander adama i dont wanna take much of your time  i wanted to say how happy we all are you found one of your pilots  adama thank you madam president  how is the search progressing for the other pilot  nothing yet but weve just begun  roslin ive spoken with the other captains in the fleet  theyve agreed to give over their ships at your disposal  if itll increase the odds of finding her  adama frack the odds were going to find her  excuse me thank you  tell them we could sure use the help  ill coordinate their efforts with your cic continued good luck  adama thank you  thank you    so it looks like were going to be staying here for a while     you all right  yeah im fine its just a  how long you think it will be before the cylons wonder what happened  to their missing patrol and send another one here to look for it  you have attacked us hundreds of times were still here  i think youll find that we are more than adequately protected  might be a little tricky with the fleet scattered over half this system  iooking for the lost pilot  no 6 how many days till the cylons return gaius  one    no 6 two  three at the most  roslin doctor    your requisitions  thank you  baltar madam president i dont mean to be impertinent really but  do you honestly think this is wise  you are compromising the security of the entire fleet  while we search for one solitary pilot  it is a risk but those pilots put their lives on the line for us every day  yes i was just saying that to  baltar im not insensitive that is what im saying  baltar i happen to know the missing pilot personally  not as personally as youd like  guess youll never find out if shes a real blonde  its all the more difficult for me on one hand i think of the pilot  and on the other hand i think of the thousands of defenceless  women and children i meant throughout the fleet  i am sure commander adama has considered all of this   thank you doctor  yes of course he has  of course he has thank you        its okay  okay get to higher ground  then they see you then they rescue you  apollo galactica we are being bounced around like beach balls down here  apollo visibility about two best spectrum dualla copy apollo  blue blue flight go vertical now         anything  no   i dont think anyones left out there  must be someone  we cant be the only two people left in the world  good news is my legs much better  and weve got antiradiation meds to last three months  helo i say we load up as much food as we can and  boomer move out  try to find a raptor or a transport or something we can fly off caprica  unless you can think of a reason to stay  not really looking forward to going back out there  helo ive almost started to think of this place as  helo home boomer home  no sleep a little longer  who knows when well find clean sheets again  im going to go topside and make some breakfast  breakfast              hey is breakfast ready  helo get out of here go    lords its kara thrace  im running a little low on o2 and i could use a lucky break  you know okay just thought id mention it      not bad shooting if i do say so myself  lords i owe you one  looks like i found my ride out of here if i can fix you up    galactica apollo bingo fuel  dualla roger apollo return to base  apollo cant you tank me in orbit dualla negative apollo  the tankers are refilling youll be dry before they can launch  adama are these figures correct gaeta yes sir  gaeta atmospheric ops mean viper and raptor engines run continuously  fuels going to be a real problem if we keep it up  adama any report from the civilian ships tigh nothing theyre spread pretty far out  well have a hell of a time trying to cover them if the cylons pop in  we should consider pulling the civvies into a defensible formation  no keep all the ships on the search  weve left enough people behind i dont wanna leave starbuck behind   committing the entire fleet to this  i said no  we are going to find our missing pilot and were going to bring her home  we leave no one behind  resume your duties    helo sharon  helo sharon where are you    damn it sharon where are you  sharon  frack me  are you alive    what the hell happened this time captain  i hit the roll thrusters to level off for set down but only the left one fired  its that crap youre flying into down there gums everything up  get me another viper  tyrol love to but this is 13 vipers that are down plus your mark vii im out  ive got a pilot down and i need another viper now  i realise that captain  but you can push people a lot further than machines  im the cag youre the chief just make it happen  commander the clock has passed five hours sir for starbucks o2 supply  noted  gaeta heres the photo mosaic for the area we searched so far  weve got to do better than this  cant see far when youre hugging the ground  you cant see anything from altitude  not to mention the crap in the air that keeps screwing up our ships  apollo thirteen vipers down for repairs  adama we need more eyes tigh where we going to get them  apollo pull the cap tigh what  redeploy the combat air patrol to the search  bad idea the cap is the fleets only defence  if all vipers are fracking around on the moon  when the cylons come calling were maggot meat  then bring the fleet closer to the moon  we can always scramble the vipers from the search to meet any attack  bottom line we can double the area we can search in the time we have left  starbuck would be the first one to tell you not to do this  nothing would make you happier would it leave her behind  get rid of the foulmouthed insubordinate pilot that keeps challenging your authority  you are way out of line im not the one confusing personal feelings with duty  what the hell does that mean  you are way too close to this because shes your friend  gentlemen  we have work to do captain  get as many birds up in the air as you can and you find our girl  you got it  starbuck oh my gods  you bite me ill bite you back    starbuck so i guess the only thing flying you is you  this must be your brain  i dont think youll need it  good thing that i brought one of my own  even cockroaches have to breathe how the hell do you  socinus captain call for you sir  can someone finish this up for me  apollo where is it socinus that way  apollo yeah apollo billy hold for president roslin  roslin howre you holding up  better than my viper were slapping one together from pieces of the others  roslin i need your help  did you know that your father just redeployed the combat air patrol   yes madam president it was my idea  your idea  we need every viper weve got  roslin maybe im missing something about the tactics involved  but isnt the fleet defenceless without the cap  apollo only for a short time  because after that karas oxygen will be gone and shell be dead  are you very close with lt thrace  im close with all my pilots  and i assume the same is true for your father  his pilots mean a lot to him to all of us we dont leave anyone behind  but we have left people behind you know that  not this time  your ftl drive should be spun up and ready  just make sure everyone is set to jump at the first sign of trouble  with all due respect captain  there are times when it is necessary for the safety of the fleet to put  not this time  we just havent exhausted all the options  and the safety of the fleet has not been compromised   i hope you find her  thank you  blue flight reports bingo fuel sir  have them stay on the search send the tanker to them  is there a problem mr gaeta  its just that trying to tank in that turbulence sir will be extremely hairy  i suggest we wait until the clock has run down  and then tank up on the way back to galactica  did someone call them back to galactica   i just assumed  the search was over it was hopeless  that we should write starbuck off as dead   is that what youre telling me mr gaeta  no sir  then what are you trying to tell me mr gaeta     you have your orders  yes sir  time is up shes out of o2  the clock is a guess  adama we dont know for a fact that starbuck is out of air  her tank only holds so much oxygen  she could have a reserve supply in her survival gear  tigh a reserve adama yes  what she just happened to pack an extra bottle today  its possible  we are putting people at risk   we have pilots out there  we are not quitting  pushing themselves their ships too hard all for the sake of  we are not quitting and you are relieved colonel    i stand relieved sir    come on youre part biological right  which means you need oxygen right  so its got to be here somewhere    commander the president  adama  commander adama i just wanted to say how very sorry i am about lt thrace  please give my condolences to your son and to the rest of the crew  excuse me madam but i think youve been misinformed   how  we dont know if starbucks dead  roslin i was told that her oxygen had run out a half an hour ago  thats an estimate she may have a reserve supply  well continue the search as long as theres a chance she may be alive  roslin and how long will that be adama until i say stop  this is a military decision madam president  thank you for your concern  starbuck first on the list seal you up  figure out what controls what  one of us needs a bath  now youre going to teach me how to fly  red flight reports an area of highlands here   increased visibility out to 15 clicks maybe  its the wrong side of the moon  dualla commander adama almost impossible to  we have a signal from colonial ones shuttle  they request permission to land the presidents on board  why wasnt i notified the president was coming onboard  there was no advance notice sir  gaeta i didnt know she was coming adama lets go  adama have col tigh meet her at the airlock  adama bring her to my quarters please dualla very well  every flying machine has four basic controls  power pitch yaw and roll  where are yours    safety tip number one dont touch that  are you going to order us to stop the search  i came here to talk not to give orders   it may take an order  why  col tigh do i need to know something  its gone beyond military needs its personal for the commander and lee  because of lt thrace  because of her and because of zak adama  roslin the commanders dead son  its complicated take about three weeks to explain  weve got about three minutes talk fast  shes going to press  im with you  tigh president roslin  adama madam president  skip the formalities you both know why im here  termination of a pilots rescue mission is a military decision  thats a bunch of crap this isnt military its personal  neither of you can let go of kara thrace because shes your last link to zak   you dont know anything about my brother  dont even begin captain  youve lost perspective as have you  under normal circumstances it would just be sad  that you two cant come to terms with zaks death  in this situation youre putting your pilots at risk  youre exposing the fleet to possible attack every moment we stay here  weve been at risk of an attack since day one  adama the cylons wont be missing their patrol for at least one more day  col tigh how much aviation fuel has been expended in this operation  fortythree percent of reserves  almost half thats unacceptable  operations in the moons atmosphere have put one third of your fighters out of action  that is also completely unacceptable  crap unacceptable whatever it is you feel about this  the recovery of one pilot is a military matter  all right its military fine  and youre both officers and youre both honourable men  youre both perfectly aware that you are putting the lives  of over 45000 people and the future of this civilisation at risk  for your personal feelings  now if the two of you of all people can live with that  then the human race doesnt stand a chance  clear your heads    combat standby  this is the commander  terminate search operations bring everyone home  prepare the fleet to make a jump to the next system were leaving  okay so it either works or it doesnt      okay its power roll pitch and yaw  we have control take me home    you stink but youre one hell of a flying machine  i want you to know i think shes wrong  i think we have come to terms with what happened to zak  i havent  i need to know something  why did you do this why did we do this  is it for kara for zak for what  kara was family  you do whatever you have to do sometimes you break the rules   and if it was me down there instead  you dont have to ask that  are you sure  if it were you  wed never leave  adama colonel tigh commander   resume your duties  sir fighters are aboard sir  civilian ships have begun their jumps to the next star system  tigh give the word well start our clock adama start the clock  tigh mr gaeta start the clock gaeta starting clock  madam president would you like to return to your ship  thank you ill stay here id like to see how the professionals do it  as you wish   execute jump lt gaeta  aye sir jump clock is running  gaeta navigation crewman 1 go  gaeta ftl crewman 2

sir  youre right its just a matter of time  hes on an intercept course hell be on us before we complete the jump  action stations launch vipers  tigh  action stations launch alert vipers cylon raider approaching    starbuck now look before you shoot please  gaeta gun captains report weapons manned and ready  tigh where the hell are the vipers dualla most are being fuelled  dualla hot dog and apollo are in the tubes  launch officer viper i clear forward  navcon green interval failure abort launch  frack  i guess im going solo  why only one cylon this time  it could be a lone recon mission  or the vanguard for a cylon base ship about to jump on top of us  either way were going to have to take it out before we can jump  galactica apollo target in sight    you idiot didnt anybody teach you intercept protocol  starbuck okay were going to have to do this the hard way then  this bastards good  theyre closing fast port guns have a firing solution  very well   hold still you little  no cigar for you  just come a little bit closer  not that close  what the  ive lost him  galactica i repeat he is nowhere to be seen   dradis  no help their reports have merged  tigh launch tube status dualla still fouled   well have a viper away in 45 seconds  this will be over in 45 seconds  holy  galactica the cylon is now flying in formation with me  right above my head  apollo this thing is acting weird adama put me through    apollo its starbuck adama what  come again apollo  galactica the cylon raider is marked starbuck  its written under the fracking wing    bring it into the bay  if it does anything take it out  apollo wilco galactica but i tell you what its got to be her  this thing is flying with some serious attitude    now your ass belongs to me  like my new toy  boy when you take a souvenir you dont screw around   oh my god you smell like a latrine  you want to give me a bath   howre you feeling  been a hell of a lot worse  dont have any ambrosia but the doc  can fix you up with some really nice stuff  its not bad is it the knee  doc says its too early to tell but knowing you youll be fine   kara  yeah  you did good    adama  get better okay   need anything  a stogie would be
