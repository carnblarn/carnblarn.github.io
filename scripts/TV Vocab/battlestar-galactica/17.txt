                previously on battlestar galactica  congratulations doctor youve just uncovered your very first cylon  im not a cylon  this isnt happening    ive been here for months by myself on the run one step ahead of the cylons  youre going out there or im gonna blow your brains out right here right now    how did crashdown die  he gave his life in the finest tradition of the service  you have my parole when im on duty  ill make no attempt to free her or sow insurrection among the crew  and when im not on duty ill report directly back to this cell  i have a few months to live  and in that time i will lead the people to salvation  it is my sole purpose  as it appears obvious that  the government cannot function under the current circumstances  i have decided to dissolve the quorum of twelve    and as of this moment  i have declared martial law  tigh youre sweating  its hot in here  how long have you known  lt valerii was planning to assassinate commander adama  i had no idea she was planning anything of the kind  you were frakking her  i ended that weeks ago on your orders you covered for her you lied for her  i admit i used bad judgment  you protected her at every turn  colonel i had no idea she was a cylon  i would like to exercise my article 21 rights at this time   im sure you would  i guess you havent heard cylons dont have rights  cylon wait a minute you know what we do with cylons chief  i am not a cylon roslin came up with the execution method  im galen tyrol  she put a cylon out of the airlock  my father was a priest my mother was an oracle  ive served on battlestar since i was 18 years old  the pegasus columbia atlantia galactica    dont talk to me like youre a soldier  you are not a soldier    the old man always had a soft spot for you let him decide what to do with you  colonel you gotta believe me i am not a cylon  id never do anything to hurt adama  i love the old man  thats what your girlfriend said get him the hell out of here        chief    i thought you were on kobol    dont you talk to me  dont come near me dont touch me if you do  i swear i will kill you      no sign of centurions on the perimeter i dont like it  human toasters dont go anywhere alone  think theyre bait no  a pair of cylons dont just drive up here in broad daylight  not after we hit that convoy last week  frakking a    all right screw it  pass the word for everybody to sight in  i want to blow these cylons away before they ever knew what hit them  good  we got to figure out where the hell we are  why you dont know  youre the navigator  you were driving  starbuck all right we can head toward cobbs point  theres an emergency airstrip there  no ive been  i was thinking we could head southwest towards   do you hear that  drive through a lot of bad neighborhoods better safe than sorry  i hear that    were sitting ducks down here  you go ill cover why me  dont start fine  ready yeah  go    five of them spread out between nine and one 50 meters  ready  go  i didnt see any shiny silver out there  i think were dealing with the human variety  hope so theyre not as tough as mechanicals  yeah  they do bleed good though you gotta like that    helo lets get out of here come on  they locked the chief up with boomer tigh thinks hes a cylon  i know im going to see the colonel now  i think he wants me to find a way to clear the chief or  or what throw him out the airlock like a piece of garbage  if commander adama were in charge this would never happen  yes but hes not in charge is he  but ive known the chief for years hes no toaster  he was involved with lieutenant valerii who most certainly is a toaster  that word is racist i dont like it  cally sure  hes shown some bad judgment getting involved with her  but that doesnt mean hes a toaster youve got to help him  say something gaius  tell me you wont have racial epithets used in your presence  im very sorry  i was going to tell the colonel theres nothing i can do  the cylon detector i developed doesnt work clearly  no  youve got to help him  your childs gonna be half toaster how does that make you feel  nothing could make me happier  i just dont know what id possibly say excuse me  cally he helped you  he didnt tell anyone what you did on kobol  what you did to crashdown    what i did to crashdown saved your life  are you blackmailing me  help the chief help yourself doctor  yes doctor thats what youre best at isnt it  deck log  what the hells the matter with your cylon detector doctor  you gave the assassin a pass  yes but that was a beta test a preliminary  clearly i havent perfected my methodology and she slipped through  dualla fuel report  tigh what the hell are you telling me here  that we are back to square one  that no ones results are definitive no l  that we have no way of knowing who are the cylons among us  baltar im not saying that  im saying since valeriis test  since the assassins test ive developed a new set of protocols  which should eliminate any errors anomalies that cropped up earlier  if you let me test the chiefs blood  i might be able to tell once and for all  no if i want a definitive answer no more of your weasly technobabble  hes a cylon or hes not  so get down there and do something right for a change  i am the vice president  legally speaking if the president is incapacitated  shouldnt i take over her duties  legally speaking i have declared martial law and that makes you nobody    so unless you want to join roslin in the brig  i suggest you get to work  its good to see you colonel  arent you getting tired of the continual humiliation  the disrespect from mechanics and colonels alike  what do you think  maybe its time to do something about it  gaeta sir whats this  the fleet captains are reporting protests among civilians  demonstrations petitions even some civil disobedience  all over the declaration of martial law  sir theres more  the tauranian refining vessel has stopped refining tylium  they say if they dont have a voice in the government  what  their captain says theyll send fuel  once a civilian government has been restored  and three other ships are also refusing to resupply galactica  until the presidents reinstated  and i got a note from combat warning about problems with tylium resupply  so watch your fuel burn until further notice  questions  when you coming back to the card game  im afraid when im off duty ill be enjoying the intimate surroundings of the brig  untilwell until further notice  come on back we miss you captain  we could bring the game to you  somehow i doubt col tigh would approve  theres one going on tomorrow night hey all right all right  hey knock it off  morning sir  sergeant shall we    morning sir  morning dee fancy meeting you here  i was just on my way sir  hey guys hows it going dee  good thanks  hows my father today  commander adamas the same captain hes sedated  resting comfortably since the surgery  trouble brewing in the fleet though oh im shocked  what kind of trouble martial law isnt going down too well  protests demonstrations  some ships are even refusing to resupply galactica  and this is the honeymoon period whats a dictator to do    yeah i wish    i wish you were in command sir  dee  hes hitting the bottle a lot  thank you for the company petty officer dualla  youre welcome sir        you okay baby  no im not okay my head feels like its gonna roll off my shoulders  what are you working on  im trying to figure out how to solve our resupply problem  now that half the fleet has gone out on strike  are you serious yes im serious  i should probably call a summit sit down with all the ship captains  and explain the situation and tell them why i had to declare martial law  screw them like you have to explain yourself to them  it wouldnt hurt might cool things down a little  what  nothing  no no no its  youre the boss  far be it for me to tell you how to do your job  i know thats one of your issues just say it  i dont know it just feels kind of touchyfeely  you know lets all sit down and talk about how we feel about martial law  bill would never do that  but you gotta do what you gotta do  i mean bill may never get on his feet again  honey  honey you handle this the way you want  theyll respect that eventually  this is the xo  mr gaeta send the following to all ships captains  message begins  resupply operations of this ship are not repeat not optional  all ships to recommence scheduled supply runs immediately  failure to comply will result in stern measures  message ends  you

altitude training  weve been on the run ever since  doing what  raiding military stores for ammo antiradiation meds  and plugging toasters whenever they show up  same as us  okay  how many foul breaks did you have in the playoff against aerilon  youre kidding right  you either have the answer or you have a bullet  three  wrong four  three last one was called back on instant replay  helo hes right

critic  heres your medication madam president  and a little something from the galley  thank you cpl venner  chamalla and licorice would you like some  i hate licorice  me too  its interesting he still calls you madam president  you still have a lot of supporters out there  something ugly is coming i can feel it  sir the refinery captains still not cooperating  and now seven other container ships  are refusing to release their supplies food medicine even coffee  coffee this is getting ridiculous  frak this its time to get their attention im sending in the marines  i want a raptor and an armed marine boarding party  for every ship refusing the resupply order  sir were stretched pretty thin on manpower  im not sure we have enough marine noncoms  to command that many boarding parties  pull pilots and deck officers  to command the boarding parties if you have to  tell them to get over there and bring back the supplies  whatever it takes  make it happen lieutenant yes sir  people step back all right  were just here for the supplies  stay out of our way and no one gets hurt  palladino for the last time step back all right  get back            cease fire    tigh four civilian dead how the frak could this have happened  what did you expect genius you put a pilot in charge of crowd control    palladino  did you give the order to shoot on that crowd  no sir of course not  the crowd surrounded us  were they armed  no sir but  you had to be there they were yelling and screaming at us  and then it got violent they started throwing things canisters  coffee i think coffee  you shot people for throwing coffee  the crowd was out of control they were pressing in on us  my men were getting hurt somebody took a shot  i dont know who it was then all hell broke loose  if ever we needed you bill its right now  troops shooting unarmed civilians this is a travesty  he has truly stepped over the line itll cause an explosion in the fleet  the press will have a field day  the ships will begin to splinter  the cylons will be able to eliminate us a few ships at a time  ive got to get out of here now  corporal  im right with you  im so glad you said that i wanna take billy and elosha with me  of course you do  ive worked out a way of getting us in the hangar deck  and i can get us a raptor  but were still gonna need clearance to get off the ship  i know how to get that you do  mmmhmm the question is where do we go once we get off this ship  well have to find some place to hide in the fleet  while we rally support among the people  apollo ive got an idea about that  youre not gonna like it  im not cut out for this i never was  dont talk like that saul this is your moment  me and bill side by side that was the deal  it was never supposed to be me alone  well like it or not youre in command so you better deal with it  i dont want to deal with it i do not want a command dont you get it  jeez why do l listen to you  what are you talking i never told you to send troops out to that ship  no no you didnt tell me to send troops anywhere  you just manipulate you always do you put the knife in and you twist it  oh right youre gonna blame me for your own inadequacies  im not blaming you ellen you are so frakking passive  that if i didnt push you well forget it  youd never get your head out of that frakking bottle and do anything    im warning you im

have to decide where your duty lies  madam president  madam president this way  oh billy madam president  im not getting on that ship with you  what  i understand what youre trying to do  but its
