                previously on battlestar galactica  hi um  werewere kinda lost again  were trying to get to the cic could you  alking no talking please  no cheating hold it up a little higher  eight sneaky  nine  uh start again  you lost track zero  ive asked you here to find out  why the cylons hate us so much  its what you said at the ceremony  that humanity was a flawed creation  and that people still kill one another  for petty jealousy and greed  hmyosaid that humanity never asked itself  why it deserved to survive  maybe you dont  sleeper agents  within the fleet  takeover by brute force  cylon impregnation  and reproduction  multiple models  suicide bombings  assault on natural resources  eyewitnesses claim to have seen one of the known cylon models  moving in and out of galacticas brig  admiral adama has made no comment  on this situation  we will continue to  how the hell did this get out to the press  im surpri it didnt happen sooner  m told youve been meeting with her regularly  allowing her to interact with members of your crew  shes a military asset  providing us with vital strategic intelligence  while we pray that shes not somehow  colluding with other cylons  if i felt for one second  that she posed some kind of a threat to this fleet  id pull the trigger on her myself  i think the fleet  may need to hear that admiral  even more they need ve it  someone took theto vitamins this morning  yeah i dont know what got into me  no youre right  keeping sharon valerii alive allowing her pregnancy  to continue  there is no road map for any of this  somebody  somebody has got to keep asking the hard questions  i agree i wanna stay ahead of this  acknowledge the cylons existence and then make  some kind of case for her to stay aboard galactica  i dont think thats gonna work  what why  i think you need to trust the people  use the press tell them the truth  i mean we barely know anything about the cylons  and until we learn more  were not gonna destroy the only source of information  that we have period  period that simple huh  uh well  um could i could i have a minute  sure important mmhmm  you were saying about the hard questions  i know its just my  debate team ring but its the best i could do  this this really isnt how i planned it  anyway um  billy  i love you  ive loved you since since the first day i met you  i mean you were half naked granted  i know that i kind of blindsided you with this  okay i mean it doesnt have to be tomorrow  we can take our time  billy i cant marry you  i dont know how else to say it  im sorry  he pulled out that ring  and it was like an electric shock  i could barely say anything  well maybe youre regretting  that you didnt say yes  no  i dont know what to make of me and billy but  i know i

im on galactica  im interested in navigational weaknesses  worm holes dark matter blind spots  likely ambushes  i would avoid these pulsar pointers  because of dradis interference  if i was gonna plan an ambush id do it there  it depends admiral  they adapt to your every move  every move triggers a countermove  adapt  thats what youre good at right  why wont you answer my question  does the fleet know  im on galactica  mm  its the baby shes kicking  the fleet knows  thatll be all for today  guards  you know if people knew how much youve relied  on that things socalled intelligence  theyd be scared out of their wits  what about you saul  are you afraid of her  you know the truth is  i dont like the way it gotten under your skin  what are you doing  what are you doing  the pressure hatch can withstand explosive decompression  the only way helps getting in  is with a raft of high explosives  or we could just let these clowns  open the pressure door for us  theres bound to be a security force on its way soon  open the door for us  why would they do that  gimme your drink  let me talk to them  the ice i need the dry ice  okay stay calm  ellen  please dont shoot  who are you  ellen tigh  get over here now  move  we are not criminals  we are members of the fleet just like you  my husbands xo of galactica  youve just made the worst mistakes of your life  colonel tigh admiral  you need to hear this  saul  ellen whats wrong  theyre holding us hostage  theyre threatening to kill us  my name is sesha abinell  i have seized control of the cloud nine lounge  and held the people in it hostage  what do you want  what i want  this is not about what i want  the colonial fleet  has become a cylonoccupied territory  you are working in collusion with a cylon agent  the very same model of a cylon  who tried to murder you admiral adama  on your own ship  we want sharon valerii  you have two hours  get me everything you can on sesha abinell  yes sir  sesha abinell  fleet records indicate shes the widow  of a ray abinell  he was a casualty aboard the greenleaf freighter  when the cylons hit it about ten weeks ago  widow  who do we have aboard cloud nine  uh rotation schedule shows  captain adama  half a marine squad  and starbucks already there on r  r  get me starbuck right away  yes sir  hell one of you beauties has got to be an o2 sensor  and im guessing its you  take a sip of carbon dioxide  there was another guy at the bar  check the back we dont want any more mistakes  kern eres anawful lot of military types here  and thats why were here  to get galacticas attention remember  page  you go  no problem  good to see ya gunny  im gonna need some of those gorillas  you call marines  most of my gorillas are already here sir  just trying to cop a little r  r  tell me about it  all right heres what we know  we got an unknown number of shooters  at least 20 hostages  and about a 90minute window  before they start throwing out bodies  you got a plan sir  lock and load  lets figure out the rest as we go along  put your weapon down  tell them  he says hes captain adama from the galactica  he just wants to talk  talk thats it just talk  theyre together  put it down  or she dies  hey she dies he dies you get it  difference is you wont do it  he will  okay  we all have someone we care about  its his son  hes not gonna choose the cylon over his son  get in line with the others  co2 is through the roof  theyre trying to suffocate us  what is this a trap  theres a reason you dont just start shooting  on a spaceship  you probably nicked a line  why dont you let me talk to the admiral  see if we cant find a way out of this  ive got  two strike teams inbound to you  eta ten minutes  well have plenty of fire power so thats good  but im concerned with limited accesedints  admiral  its abinell  keep starbuck on the line with us  adama  were losing oxygen  if its not restored the hostages die  then youll all die  because this is over  not until the cylons dead  im willing to die to see this through  you willing to risk your sons life  son of a bitch  suddenly youre listening  gods damn it  give her what she wants  give her the cylon  youre all alone on this admiral  im not gonna sacrifice a military asset  on your altar of revenge  what are you talking about  this isnt a  you said this was about us being played by the cylons  but it isnt  its about the loss of your husband and i understand that  its about you wanting to strike back  and i understand that too  but weve all lost people that we care about  an learn to live with it  i am sure you are aware admiral  of the concrete evidence  that capricas defenses were compromised  by a cylon agent  who infiltrated the ministry of defense  on the eve of the attacks  people look for complicated answers  when something terrible happens  maybe we were just caught by surprise  and were beaten  and maybe we have to learn to live with that  and maybe you are just missing the point  you were infiltrated  you the military  and you are being infiltrated again right now  you can sit there and pretend you know what youre doing  but you do not  you are being played  and the rest of us do not want to go down with your ship  i want this air system restored right now  one person comes in alone fixes it leaves  anything goes wrong  somebody gets hurt  its on your head  keep a direct line open to cloud nine  what do we do  we repair the air system  saul we cant give her sharon  i hope you know that right  i know that  we cant start dealing with the terrorists  we start now itll open the floodgates  and itll never stop  but by the way  its not sharon  its a frakkin cylon  you dont think i know that  i think theres part of you that looks into that things eyes  and still sees that yo trl  that reported aboard two years ago as a rook pilot  well its not  it never was  bill its a machine  admiral  its captain thrace  sitrep  i had one of the cloud nine techs  doublecheck the oxygen feed in there  theres nothing wrong with the air  could be a glitch  or maybe someone screwed  with one of the co2 censors inrs bar  lee  why  maybe hes giving us an opening  if i can get someone inside  get a clear idea of what were dealing with  kara this is a recon mission  get someone to volunteer  then you assess the situation  and then get the hell out of there do you understand  yes sir  im here to repair the o2 line  captain what are you doing  volunteering  let me see that  close the hatch  search her  you might not want to do that  youre running out of air in here  looks clean  do your job  cover her  wait a minute turn around slowly  check the box again  were hot lets go  get down get down  we gotta get out  now come on  billy  billy  i need shirts towels  anything i can use as a bandage  billy  nobody said you could move  you still want the cylon  do you  because if the admirals son dies  youre not gonna get a deal you get that  if he dies youre not gonna get what you want  hes right  let him go  sir its starbuck  we got a report of gunshots whats happening  my cover was blown i had to move  im sorry  any casualties  two marines  probably kia  at least one of the gunmen  and lee  it was crazy in there confused  he got hit  how bad  i dont know  stand by  hold your position  make no move unless you hear from me  it was friendly fire  lee got hit by friendly fire  i think it was me  i gotta stop the bleeding  i cant tell if it hit an artery  or  lee  dont leave me  lee lee  dont leave me okay  please  hey  hes gonna be okay  hes gonna be okay  just hang in there come on  stay with me  please stay with me  are you playing with us  are you playing with me  ive saved the ship  saved you  how many times now  five six  you just cant believe im not plotting against you  you know that there are cylons within this fleet  you know what they look like  you know where to find them  if i were to ask you  would you tell me who they are  no  that i believe  hell be all right  thanks for the concern  she loses a husband and suddenly the world  owes her an explanation  he was a good man  and he wasnt just her husband he was my brother  my brother died on picon he was a good man too  theyre all good men  the abinell woman sent over a manifesto to the press  before they took over the bar  its mostly a collection of rumor and conspiracy theories  about cylons in the military and the government  bunch of crap  its getting a lot of attention  we gotta get our people out of there  you have marines on cloud nine  pressure door  to the room has been resealed  if we try blowing it open well need so much g4  wed risk killing everyone inside  there are no options  left except for one  no  we dont strike deals with terrorists we cant  we give them sharon valerii  were inviting terrorism  and we weaken our position permanently you know that  gentlemen everyone in that room is someones son  someones wife someones mother  billy is the closest thing  that i have to family left in this world  and if you dont think that that  confuses things emotionally for me  lets not be naive  what if theyre right  what if sharon has been playing us all  plotting our destruction with every passing day  what if the terrorists are right  this isnt about sharon  its about something much bigger than that  its about the longterm survival its about the way  we conduct ourselves in all of this  sir  its abinell on the line  hows my son  alive  but my friend is dead  so are two of your soldiers  and your sons dying  you know i thought a long time about this  about what id do  about how far id go  and i honestly did not know  until this moment  chu  what  what get on your feet  what are you gonna do  saul give them what they want  its just a machine  theyre gonna kill her  hold your fire  im giving you the cylon  but you wont be alive  what does that mean  that is not the deal  it means that youve convinced me  that wy have been played  and if that be the case and shes been playing with me  then i cant take any more chances  so you make up your mind  if you wanshon valerii  you can have her  but on my terms  i give you the body  you give me
