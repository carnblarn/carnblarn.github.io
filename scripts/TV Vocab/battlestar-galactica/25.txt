                previously on battlestar galactica  im promoting you to captain  im making you commander of the pegasus air group  youre promoting me  i need a cag with guts  we are the leaders of this fleet  as such we need to set an example  oh lets just cut through the handholding shall we  two of his men murdered one of my officers  while protecting a cylon  theyre guilty they admitted it  and under regulations i have complete authority  to try convict and sentence them  and you and i both know that the penalty for that crime is death  im afraid there is only one end to this weve got to kill her  well i see that you got it to eat  thats progress i suppose  can you get it to roll over beg  admiral please  i thought you might like a fresh set of clothes  you know what i miss  sports  i used to go the pyramid court just before game time  scalp two tickets  one for me and one for you  i always liked to feel that you were there with me  the cylons call this their resurrection ship  at the moment we are too far away from the cylon home world  for the normal downloading process to work which is why they built this ship  it contains the entire apparatus necessary for cylon resurrection  then any cylon who dies out here  would be dead  as in really dead  our primary objective is a cylon vessel called resurrection  our plan is to jump in in the blackbird stealth fighter  and take out the ftl drives on the resurrection ship  preventing it from jumping away  when the ftl is destroyed  our attack squadrons will go after the resurrection ship itself  how many squadrons  all ofem  jack i want to transfer a detachment of marines to galactica  i have a mission for you kara  anything for you you know that  position marines in key areas throughout the ship  i will ask for you over the wireless  i will call you directly and when i have you on the line  and you hear me give the command execute case orange  you are to terminate adamas command started with adama  i want you to pull out your weapon  and shoot admiral cain in the head   this is a frackedup thing  that ive been asked to do  but we kill people for a living  they say shoot we shoot  so youre gonna do this  yeah im gonna do it  kara  i could use some backup  ill understand if you cant  you know better than that  yeah i guess so  people have to have this kara  trust  your word  and my word  we dont have this then  we really are no different than the cylons  thank you  oh looky here  sunshine boys are here  you know the man you killed saved my life and the lives of 50 other men  you miserable frack  you  you call me sir  yes sir  so i guess you were both getting your poles greased by that filthy little robot girl  im sorry i dont think i quite heard that right  the glass i cant hear you  so why dont you open the door come in  and well talk about it in here  thats a great idea chief  they really want to do things  hands over your head  hey hey hey slow down  on your knees on your fracking knees  slow it down slow it down  just think about what youre doing here  just think about what were doing here guys  what the frack is this  dont worry sir  well take it real slow sir  season 2 episode 12 resurrection ship part2  see the gut  thats a vulnerable area  lieutenant thorne told me that once  he said if you really want to do some damage without leaving a mark  go for the gut  youd be surprised what you can do with the simplest things  bar of soap  plain old towel  how bad could it be right  youd be surprised  cowards  cowards  is that what you said  now give me that  you know what i lied  im not going slow anymore  attention on deck  gage vireem  out of the cell standing tall  right here  remove the restraints from the prisoners  specialist gage let me ask you something  those men in there are they wearing colonial uniforms  yes sir  specialist vireem do you agree with specialist gage here  that those are in fact colonial officers  yes sir  they killed lieutenant  shut your frackinmouth  you see i dont quite understand what i just saw  because i think i saw you two knuckledraggers  treating those men like they were cylons which of course couldnt be right because  if in fact that was the case  then youre both subject to charges of assaulting a chief  and a lieutenant under color of authority in a time of war which if  im not mistaken  carries a penalty on this ship that is quite severe  now get the hell out of here  sir  sir  get out  yes sir  sir  thank you  thank you colonel  i dont want your thanks  i owe lieutenant thorne my life  as do many people on this ship  he was trying to rape a prisoner  you cant rape a machine lieutenant  you drink thrace  only to excess sir  only to excess  learn that from colonel tigh did you  not exactly  i understand you belted him once  yeah  that was something that i did without really thinking  dont apologize  some people get exactly what they deserve  from what i read about your xo  maybe he needs to get popped in the mouth every once in while hmm  i know youre very close with adama  yes sir  and i know hes a good man  and i know hes had to make some very hard choices over the last few months  lord knows i have  then maybe you can understand why he did what he thought he had to do  when you said you were going to execute helo and tyrol  let me tell you something  ive had to watch a lot of kids be put into body bags  theyre covered with flags and they float out that airlock  you think i dont understand his feelings towards his men  sometimes terrible things have to be done  inevitably  each and every one of us will have to face a moment  where we have to commit that horrible sin  and if we flinch in that moment if we hesitate for one second  if we let our conscience get in the way you know what happens  there are more kids in those body bags  more kids floating out that airlock  i dont know why  but i have a lot of faith in you  and i want you to promise me  that when that moment comes you wont flinch  do not flinch  come in  courier run from pegasus sir  they got you doing courier runs now  well i  i volunteered for this one  kara told me about her  her mission  come to change my mind  just wanted to hear it from you  decisions been made  assassination  thats your decision  thats how you resolve your differences with your superior officers  if youre gonna have some problem  backing up starbuck i can find somebody else  its not about me watching her back  im not going to debate this with you  this was a very hard decision  but i think the presidents right  this is the best way to safeguard the fleet  the president  so you and the president  yes  shes made of sterner stuff than people give her credit for  is this all i have to sign  yes sir yes sir  thank you sir  lieutenant  its good to see you  attention pegasus  jump prep underway  viper pilots report to ready room in five minutes  decoy squadrons check in with cic  fire control set parameters

things  be sure your marines and our marines are aware  of their areas of responsibility if were boarded by the cylons  the last thing we need is colonials shooting at each other  amen to that  wait outside  yes sir  sit down  ive asked you here to find out why the cylons hate us so much  im not sure i know how to answer that  i mean hate might not be the right word  i dont want to fence with you  i just want to know why  its what you said at the ceremony  before the attack  when galactica was being decommissioned  you gave a speech that sounded like  it wasnt the one you prepared  you said  that humanity was a flawed creation  and that people still  kill one another  for petty jealousy and greed  you said that humanity never asked itself why it deserved to survive  maybe you dont  resurrection ships firing up their ftl drives  theyre getting ready to jump  dont anyone look out of the window right now please  starbuck apollo  targets ftl is history shes all yours  roger that apollo xxx  sir i just received an emergency transponder from the blackbird  its the autodistress beacon  alert the search and rescue raptor  see if he had time to eject  attention on pegasus prepare

help you fulfill your destiny  do you know what i miss most  youre going to laugh when i tell you this  sports  dont do this  yeah thats right  i used to love getting to the pyramid game just before tipoff  by timing it right  i could sit down right at the horn  and then let the emotion of the crowd flood over me  waves and waves of it  like electric current  thats beautiful  and i always had two tickets  no  one for me  please  and one for you  apollo galactica  do you read  apollo galactica do you read  can you say your position  apollo galactica do you read  can you say your position  apollo galactica do you read  apollo galactica do you read  can you say your position  apollo galactica are you reading this  are you out there  apollo galactica do you read  can you say your position  apollo galactica do you read  apollo galactica are you reading this  are you out there  im sorry kara  captain thrace is reporting massive detonations  the resurrection ship has been destroyed  yes  theyve done it  clear  hes all right  hes a little shaken but i say again  apollo is all right  all the remaining cylons have jumped way  its over sir  congratulations gentlemen  im ready to die  send my soul to god  please  i wish you were here lee  oh what the hell  i am so very proud of you  secure for condition one set condition two throughout the ship  division officers submit casualty and damage report to combat  glad we didnt need your marines today  yeah  yeah me too  signal from the flagship sir  admiral cain on the line  put her through  congratulations commander  congratulations to you too admiral  a significant victory  is starbuck with you  yes she is  this is starbuck  ive been thinking about what we talked about before  its not enough to survive  one has to be worthy of surviving  thats all  i think thats very wise sir  thank you  commander i wonder if my xo is standing close by  yes he is  yes sir  congratulations jack  thank you sir  thats all  yes sir  you look like you could use a drink  thank you  oh by the way there was something i wanted to tell you  last night i was walking down this corridor here when i saw  no no no  i canti cant do this  suicide is a sin  but i need to die  what you need   is justice  i know a place where you can stay  where you will be safe  where i can look after you  why  why would you do that  because i love you  tell me admiral  can you roll over  beg  frack you  youre not my type  and she died knowing that her ship and her crew were safe  and that her mission had been accomplished  nothing was more important to her than her ship  her crew and her mission  and as i take command of pegasus i pledge to uphold those values  that made her such an effective  and heroic leader  i only knew admiral cain for a short time  so what i have to say about her will be short  she faced things  she looked them right in the eye and she didnt flinch  thats something that we do a lot around here  we secondguess  we worry  when i think about what she went through after the attack  all alone  one ship no help  no hope  she didnt give up  she didnt worry  she didnt secondguess  she acted  she did what she thought needed to be done  and the pegasus survived  might be hard to admit  or hard to hear  but i think that we were safer with her  than we are without  lee  lee you okay  are you okay  no not really  i  i broke my word to you  what are you talking about  i let you down  i wasnt there when you needed me  look  a close call like that  that would mess with anybodys head  all right  it turns out i didnt need you anyway  so  lets just be glad that we both came back alive all right  thats just it kara  i didnt want to make it back alive  i didnt think id ever see you again  same here  so  where do we go from here  so how did the cylon  manage to get off the pegasus undetected  no one really knows  there was so much chaos in the aftermath of the attack  thank the gods that you did not have to do what i advised  that makes me very happy  yes thank the gods  how are you feeling  i could sleep for about a year  but you however  do not have that luxury because you have a new job  billy  it took a little while to find that jeweler  thank you  rumor has it  that i know very little about military protocol  but i do believe  that  someone who commands more than one ship  is called an admiral  congratulations admiral adama  thank you madame president  thank you billy  i never gave up hope i just  stopped trying to get these a long time ago  just goes to show you bill  never give up hope  same goes for you laura  right
