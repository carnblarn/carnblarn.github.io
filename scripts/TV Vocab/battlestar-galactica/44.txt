                previously on battlestar galactica  my name is lee adama  and i love kara thrace  did you hear the news we got married can you believe it  no  no i cant believe it  congratulations sam and good luck  youre gonna need it   i missed you  i missed you too  the childs life must be protected at all costs  the first cylonhuman hybrid  it truly is a miracle from god  this child will not be raised by the cylon  and i can not risk cylon agents getting their hands on it  ive made my decision  we lost her we did the best we could  but shes dead and thats all there is to it  as far as the cylons know this child no longer exists  that is a good good thing  its hera  the first of gods new generation  have you seen the faces of the other five cylons   the ones that no one has seen  why do you want to know about them  i could be a cylon  i thought our food supply was inexhaustible  the food manufacturing systems been contaminated  if we just hold on until athena gets back  this algae can keep us alive indefinitely  theres a way through the star cluster and i found the planet  theres huge swathes of algae just like we thought   14 inch intake  yeah thats great  just pack em and stack em along yes right there  ive got your meter reading for the light  all this can go on the first raptor all that can go on the second one   need a hand  oh yeah  couple more days we can wrap this up get away from this stench  it stinks as bad up here as it does down there  at least it tastes as good as it smells  well its breakfast lunch and dinner until someone finds a hot fudge planet  and now what is this  who the hell is that  starbuck i guess  third time this week  its amazing how she keeps landing on the top of the pilot rotation  well  donner run their assign off a coin flip  kara probably thinks shes running a stream of bad luck  i should probably get over there  im gonna skip the meet and greet this time if you dont mind  sure  brought her in a little hot dont you think  yeah well had i known i was beinggraded  i would have thrown in a couplebarrelrolls  remind me to thank the cag  for stiffing me on these crack donut runs huh  this is insane you know  thats just the way i like it  should we start emptying the tents  yeah get this cleared up first and then get to the tents  okay   here  good  i can barely look dee in the eye  we gotta do something about that  okay like what  i dont know like divorce  no  oh come on lets get real here  you said yourself things were bad  your marriage was failing  yeah but marriage is a sacrament  its not a pyramid game you dont  you dont get two others lee  i made a vow in the sight of the gods and im not gonna break that  youre breaking it every time we do this  every time  divorce is different  this is just bending the rules  no im sorry i cant i cant  i cant live like this  every time i look at my wife i see my own guilt reflected in her eyes  wow lee that is really poetic of you  but you dont need to make that big of a deal out of this  well it is a big deal kara it is  it is  okay  so i wont divorce and you wont cheat  so where does that leave us  trapped  who are the final five  i could be a cylon  shes not well  whats the matter hera  its okay hera  its okay  im here for you   our initial radio carbon dating suggests the temples at least 4 000 years old  which lines up with the exodus of the 13th tribe  do you really think youve found the temple of five  yeah  i recognize it from the books in my fathers study madame president  he was a priest and the temple of five was an important part of our faith  well his faith anyways  could this place be related to the eye of jupiter chief  you got me madame president  all i know is the stuff i kinda remember from sneaking  into my dads study when he wasnt looking  the eye of jupiter  what exactly are we talking about  according to the scriptures its a marker  that was left behind by the 13th tribe its supposed to point the way to earth  chief were on alert this is adama  admiral lt gaeta in cic we have multiple dradis contacts   4 cylon baseships jumped into view  on our way   sitrep  four baseships inbound at high speed  four  the bastards practically jumped right on top of us  fleets spooling up their ftl drives sir  preparing to jump to emergency coordinates on your command   do it  aye sir  we gotta hold this position until everyones back on board   how many are down there  enough  if the eye of jupiter is in that temple and is a marker on the way to earth  we cant let the cylons get their hands on it  stand by to launch vipers  somethings odd here the cylons arent launching raiders  the baseships are standing off outside of weapons range  that is odd  admiral  its the cylon baseship requesting to speak with you  put it through the speaker  this is admiral adama  admiral  i cant tell you what a genuine pleasure it is to hear your voice  this is gaius baltar  i cant believe were allowing cylons on this ship  they must want something pretty bad or else  they would have started shooting as soon as they jumped in  why would they send baltar  theyve gotta know we wont believe a word he says  he can say whatever he wants the longer he talks  the more time we have to get lee and his people off the planet  it feels like old times doesnt it  i cant believe how much i actually miss this place  you know you cant return  theyd toss you out the nearest airlock and then throw a party  yes i know  still i cant help feeling im finally   home  if youre really a cylon a member of the final five  these feelings are just part of your programming   part of your cover  and if im a human being after all  if im not one of the final five  then this is the last chance i ever get to see my kind again  colonel wait  well look at this should we salute  thats boomer  the one who shot the old man  well you just lost your visiting privileges  hold that thing here until we get back  yes sir  you three keep on moving  laura  laura i  its good to see you  weapons are hardly necessary  yes exactly  we come in peace  what do you want  we want the eye of jupiter  so lets just skip all the denials and protestations  and go straight to what we know that you have people on the ground  and we know that you found the original settlement of the 13th tribe  it also doesnt take a lot of deduction to conclude  that the only reason you havent cut your losses and jumped away by now  is that you probably found the artifact but you havent been able  to retrieve it yet is that about right madame president  we have our people on the surface were not leaving them behind  thats a touching but not very convincing idea  look the chances that weve all converged on this small planet  at the same time are infinitesimally small  so we all understand its not chance  you want the eye the cylons want the eye  i would like to discuss the practical issues that come to hand  and there are some so that we can reach some accommodation  the less this man says the better this will go  wait a minute  if it wasnt for me the cylons would have blown you out of the sky   two seconds after wed arrived  i think you can handle this alone  if you can stomach it  so ive saved your life  again  how many times is that now im beginning to lose count  if it wasnt for me youd all be dead  whats your offer  you give us the eye of jupiter  we let you go  and  well throw in baltar   what are you talking about  indeed   whats he saying  im improvising  throw in something sweeten the pot  beside i suspect that the admiral and madame president  would enjoy some nice quiet private time with their former leader  am i right  its worth thinking about  definitely worth thinking about  despite that uniform its not your home anymore  ive made my choice and i know where my loyalties lie  what if i told you that your daughter was still alive  id say you were lying  well someones lying  but its not me  heras alive  at least for now  shes ill and we dont know why  yeah right  baltar found her on new caprica during the evacuation  shes on our baseship right now  from what we could gather she was hidden at laura roslins school  which means that she probably planned the whole thing in the first place  i dont need to listen to this watch her  they let you think that she was dead  you dont do that to a person you do that to a thing  thats what your friends think of you sharon  youre not one of them youre a thing  were not giving you the key to finding earth  you try bringing it up from that planet see what happens  we outnumber you four to one  im setting the terms now  make any attempt  to attack this ship or the people on the planets surface  ill launch every nuke ive got  lay waste to the entire continent  youre bluffing  you want to find earth as much as we do  guards   escort them back to their ship  yes sir  well it would help if i knew what i was looking for  does it really look like an eye  i dont know lee  ive looked at the scriptures and they make reference to the eye being  left in some sort of temple but theres no physical description  all we know for sure is it supposedly points the way to earth  and you believe that  the cylons do i cant take a chance that theyre right  if it looks like theyre going to get into the temple  your order is to blow it  understood whats my  whats going on  the cylons are jamming the wireless  every frequency  okay we need to establish our communications  work out a plan to defend this temple while tyrol searches  defend it with what  a dozen marines maybe five more military  were gonna have to draft the civilians  can i make a suggestion that you wont like  do you make any other kind  use sam to command the civilians  youre not serious   lee  hey sam  hi  i heard you were coming down  i guess it takes an emergency to get us in the same room these days  can we do this later please  sam i need you to command the civilians  form them into fire teams  ill give my deployment orders through sergeant  deployment orders fire teams  come on some of these guys have never even held a rifle before  well youve supposed to be the expert in turning civilians into soldiers  no we were guerilla fighters  all right hit and run  keep moving keep the enemy off balance  ive never had to defend a fixed position thats a whole different game  youre just gonna have to learn it fast because thats what were doing  were defending this fixed position until chief finds his eye of jupiter  okay so you want us to risk our lives  for something that you havent even found yet  listen sam im not even sure it exists  but i dont have to tell you every little godsdamn detail  you know what you have to explain to me  the majors in charge on this one okay  okay  well i certainly wouldnt want to step between you and your major  in my thought that went really well   hell do it  hed better  i miss nicky   do you think hes okay  yes hes fine   hes on galactica hes fine  i know  you know when i was growing up i hated everything  about the faith  rules rituals  endless discussions at the dinner table  i used to  sneak into my moms prayer room  you know holiest of the holies i would dance around naked  with porn magazines just to defy the gods and tell them to frak off  i mean i dont even know how i found this place  i just got this urge to start   walking and then suddenly  here it is  you should see the look on your face when youre in here  theres this   reverence  you even talk softer  i feel something in here  something true  but here i am setting charges  in this special place  holiest of the holies  this is  the temple of five  if my parents could see this  and im gonna blow it up  i noticed some anomalies in the solar radiation belt  i made an analysis of the stars vibrational modes  sure enough  it appears to be highly unstable  if you can believe it on the verge of going supernova  when  it could be tomorrow  it could be next year theres no way of knowing for sure sir  when it does happen the only warning that were likely to get  is a fast helium flash  well have to jump out of here before the blow hits the planetary system  sir i am not one to look for religious signs  but  i cant get my head around these odds  thats human and cylon  both converge on this planet at this exact moment  just as the stars are about to go supernova  im not a religious person mr gaeta as you both know  so if this is the work of higher power  then they have one hell of a sense of humor  we have a stand off very predictable  they have the eye and theyll nuke it  if we try to take it and well shoot them down  if they try bringing it up to galactica   how do we know theyre not bluffing  you dont  we threes feel that we cant afford to take the chance  i think were missing the big picture here  we have the opportunity to rid the universe  of the human pestilence once and for all  we can discuss that after we get the eye of jupiter  after we find the path to earth  let me point out that it doesnt matter  if we find earth in 5 days  or if we find earth in 5000 years  were machines  well still be around to savor the great miracle  so let them destroy the eye  if indeed they have it  we have to take advantage of the situation  and take down galactica once and for all  or we could stand here and do nothing  were not doing nothing cavil   plans are in motion  im sorry what does that mean  danna  ive put a heavy raider down on the planets surface  as soon as we jumped in  i thought that would be our best chance of slipping by their dradis  seems i was right  is there any reason the rest of us werent involved in this decision  it was a needtoknow mission  so now i am telling you because you need to know  the point is we have cut off their troops communications  and weve put our own troops on the ground  so as soon as the centurions retrieve the eye  you can take out galactica  okay heres the deal  were out of options  the cylons have got us pinned on this rock  and our only way out of here is to hold this place  until galactica can send a rescue party  so ive divided you into two teams okay  team one is gonna be distributing ammunition throughout the camp  team two is gonna be making homemade tylium mines  i know thats not glamorous work  but we gonna need the extra firepower  in case the cylons decide to take a shot at us  look i know some of you are scared  and thats okay cause  im scared too  but if we keep our heads and we do our jobs  we can do this we can all get out of here in one piece  and berley has a list of your names and your assignments  make sure you get with her see you outside  that was good  honest  youd make a good officer  an officer huh  like you  someone who swears an oath  and knows how to keep it  im not really sure   what you think is going on  dont insult me okay  im not stupid  i know my wife i know how she is  we been married for a year and a half what do you think youre the first  i chose to marry kara thats my business  but you  i dont know what the hell you think youre trying to do  well im trying to fight a war  im trying to get these people off this rock in one piece  anything for the cause major  gaius i am on the verge of seeing the faces of the final five cylons  maybe the face of god himself   the five lights of the apocalypse rising  struggling towards the light  scenes revealed only to those who enter the temple  only to the chosen one  the chosen one  the chosen one  the five await me  gaius im so close to knowing the truth  what truth  caprica  id like to think that we three have shared something  transcended the barriers that separate people and yet somehow  the more time goes on the more i find myself on the outside looking in  well thats not the case at all is it  because we three were integral were part of  were finished  baltars and my destiny  lie separate from yours caprica  the five lights will be revealed only to those who enter the temple  we have to go down to the planet  only you and i can see this through  what are you after  what is this secret that you keep pursuing  you have to tell me the truth  i love you both  we love you too  but this is something you cannot share with us  something i cant share with you  i loved you when everyone else wanted you dead  now look you mustnt misunderstand  its not personal  its transcendent  its like what you said its transcendent  pray for us caprica  well be praying for you  okay he wants us to set up forward observation posts  hardwired back to base for communications  the ops are gonna be staggered at strategic locations  giving us as much warning as possible if there is a cylon advance  since we only have one raptor captain thrace will fly point  oh joy  wireless is dead so if you do make contact  do not engage fly to the closest observation post  have them relay the information back to command  be sure to note force strength direction of march and position  i have flown recon once or twice lieutenant  griggs you and varrick  are gonna set up an observation post here  hanek and deetco you go here   and who gets lucky number 3  that would be sergeant fisher and me  do you have a problem with that captain   no  we go in an hour  green base foxfire 1  green base foxfire 1  we are open for business over  son of a bitch  tell me youre sending this  shes relaying a message it says century  starbucks been hit  i say again starbucks going down  theres really not much more on the eye in these scriptures but there is  several interesing stories about the temple listen to this  five pillars of the temple  were fashioned after the five priests   devoted to the one whose name  laura  what  the cylon we know as boomer  arrived with the others  she told our sharon  that her child was alive  and that she was on board one of the cylon baseships  and that she had been seen on new caprica in your school  the child is alive  yes  yes  the child was at the school yes i kept her there  and we suspected  that the cylons captured her during the exodus  from new caprica yes its true  listen the thing you might want to know is that when she  do you have any idea what weve gone through  you of all people  know what its like to lose a child  the difference is your childs still alive  and eventually i hope you become grateful of that  i want to see her  what you mean shes gone down gone down where  somewhere in the north valley  okay get your men on the line full ammo loads   theyre coming from the north  were gonna setup a rescue party  no  we dont have the manpower we have to defend the position   lee she could be dying out there  yeah i know that sam  but we are thin on the ground here and the cylons are on the march  we cant help her we have to hold our positions  are you out of your frakkin mind  we just picked up 6 heavy raiders  falling away from the cylon fleet definitely heading toward the planet  i dont get it   theyd have to know we see them  theyre testing us  want to know if were bluffing about nuking the planet  unfortunately we are bluffing  are we   mr hoshi  aye sir  order nuclear groundstrike missiles in the launch tubes four through ten  aye sir this is a nuclear mission order  the majors right  we dont have any troops to spare if were gonna hold this position  screw this position  we can take those hills use guerilla tactics thats ive been talking about  no that is not the mission we have our orders we are stronger  what are you some goddamn windup tin soldier   this is my wife were talking about  i know who she is  and i have known her and cared about her a hell of a lot longer than you  you can do whatever the frak you want i am going after my wife  missiles are loaded admiral  open launch tube doors  doors are open admiral  what are you doing  getting ready to nuke the planet  radiological detection   theyve opened their missile doors  hes bluffing   i cant let you do that sam  i am not asking you for permission  sergeant mathias  load target package threebravo  set ground zero for the underground structure  are we prepared to sacrifice lee  theyre loading a targeting package  its a bluff dont let him rattle you  the risk to us is unacceptable turn back the raiders  the ships cannot turn back he wont launch it  and danna was explicit that she and baltar make it to the planets surface  so is that what all this is really about  and the heavens opened up  and they saw the eye  but where is that frakking eye  are you kidding me you gonna shoot me now  i cant let you go  i need you on the line i need you commanding those civilians  im sorry sam but you cannot go  im sorry too major  but you cant stop me  release of nuclear weapons is now authorized  sir
