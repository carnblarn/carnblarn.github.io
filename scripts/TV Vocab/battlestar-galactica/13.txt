me ive tried  commander i have the president on the line  adama bear witness put on your headset  adama madam president moments ago lt thrace took the cylon raider   on an unscheduled and unauthorised jump  yes  do you have any knowledge of this incident  lets save some time here commander the question you really want to ask me  is whether or not i asked lt thrace to take the raider to caprica  roslin the answer to your question is yes     you and i had talked about this  yes we had  adama we both decided it was a military decision  my responsibility as president is first and foremost  to protect and preserve this fleet and its future  in the end that outweighs any other consideration it has to  by taking the raider  youve placed our people on the surface of kobol in direct danger  roslin im very aware of the danger our men and women are in on kobol  i am also deeply aware of the danger this civilisation will be in  if i ignore the pursuit of this arrow  im going to have to ask you for your resignation madam president  roslin no  then im terminating your presidency as of this moment  commander adama i will exercise the authority of this office  until i am unable to do so  so if you want to stage a coup  youre gonna have to come over here and arrest me   i dont want any bloodshed  of course you dont neither do i  neither does the press theyre here by the way   the press  theyre recording every minute     what is it captain  isolate colonial one  mr gaeta  jam any transmissions in or out of colonial one immediately   yes sir  prepare a strike team  as long as shes president shes dangerous  if she can turn starbuck against us shes capable of anything  yes sir   shes bluffing  well lets hope so  theres also a cylon base ship out there to deal with  leave that to me  this government survived a cylon attack it will survive william adama  roslin i think hes bluffing  but just in case we need to be prepared  i know their security detail they will defend that ship  well have to take her down compartment by compartment  adama mr gaeta gaeta sir  am i correct in assuming that i have two cylon transponders left  yes sir but only one of them is fully functional  one will do  now i need a pilot  boomer sir adama as you were   how are you feeling  it looks worse than it is sir  things are moving very quickly and i need every pilot  im ready sir  i have a very special mission for you and i wont kid around   its high risk extremely high risk  i understand  adama i need you to lightjump to kobol and take care of this base star  were placing a cylon transponder aboard your raptor  in theory it should allow you to approach the base star without getting fired upon  but well still be idd as colonial raptors once were in visual range  for all they know you could be two cylon agents  returning with a captured raptor  adama once youre inside the defence perimeter  i need you to make them think you want to dock  you have to fire your nuke into the loading bay  and then jump back home immediately do you understand  i understand  i can do it sir i know i can  you have to  yes sir        starbuck this doesnt look good  please tell me this was not all for nothing    im good  i am really good  im home  wow im home      gaeta please tell me that youre right about this transponder thing      stop stop that  im nervous  like anything scares you  things scare me helo i have feelings  you have software  i dont know if you can hear this or not helo  but what we had between us was important it was very important   why  because it was the next step  because it brings us closer to god  dont mock the gods its a human belief im human theyre our gods  but beyond that i just want you to know that i genuinely feel something for you  i dont care  i dont love you  i loved what i thought was you  helo i think theres something else that you should know    im pregnant  apollo  galactica apollo we have visual on colonial one  tell apollo hes

this may not be the safest place  billy how many civilians are in the cargo hold   there is room in the cargo hold and i implore you to find refuge there  with the other civilians this is my choice
