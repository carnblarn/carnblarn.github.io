                they cylons were created by man  they rebelled  they evolved  there are many copies  and they have a plan  previously on battlestar galatica  theres enough algae on this planet to feed the entire fleet  but the star in the system is highly unstable  if you can believe it on the verge of going supernova  we just picked up four base ships inbound at high speed  its just a matter of time until the cylons find out what were up to on this planet  starbuck has gone down  i am going after my wife  i cant let you do that sam i am not asking you for permission  sergeant mathias  what if i told you that your daughter was still alive  id say you were lying  shes on our base ship right now  shes ill and we dont know why  i mean i dont even know how i found this place  i just got this urge to start walking and then suddenly  here it is  the scriptures say this temple is the final resting place of the eye of jupiter  what exactly are we talking about  its a marker that was left behind by the 13th tribe  its supposed to point the way to earth  we want the eye of jupiter  make any attempt to attack this ship or the people on the planets surface  ill launch every nuke ive got  major youve got to hold off the cylons until chief finds the eye of jupiter  if it looks like theyre gonna get into the temple your order is to blow it  we have to go down to the planet  i am so close to seeing the faces of the last five cylons  the final five revealed only to those who enter the temple  only to the chosen one  the chosen one  we just picked up six heavy raiders heading down toward the planet  order nuclear groundstrike missiles im not gonna let the cylons get their hands on the eye  are we prepared to sacrifice lee  missiles are loaded admiral  release of nuclear weapons is now authorized  mrgaeta  disable launch and warhead safeties on tubes 4 through 10  safeties disabled  warheads are armed  xo  please input your firing code  these nukes will obliterate anything or anyone within 20 klicks of the temple  i know  hes gonna do itrecall the raiders immediately  we agree  bring them back  we agreeafter all this time  we cant afford to lose everything  we agree  bring them back  algae planet base camp  if kara dies out there  i swear to gods i will kill you myself  if she dies out there ill let you  so what are we gonna do now follow me around with a gun  because that is the only way that i am not going after kara  private sykes  sir  get lieutenant dualla on the line  yessir  im hereobservation post 3  do you have eyeballs on starbucks position  negative we have no visual on her raptor but i can see smoke from the crash site  she went down behind a hill a couple klicks away  can you get to the raptor  i dont knowits pretty far away theres minimal cover  is it doable  i dont know  key  standing by  launch sequence set to auto  they want the key to finding earth as much as we do  he wont just destroy it  we spoke and the decisions been made  fire on my mark  sir the raiders are turning back  not all of them uh correction  five have turned back  one is still en route back to the planet  what are you doing  he wont launch against just one ship  he won thats not the issue  we made a decision  danna has to turn back  nocall danna and baltar  na turn them around now  what do you mean no  this is something that we have to do  he wont launch over one shipyoull see  you want me  you want me to rescue captain thrace  attempt the rescue  yes sir  foxfire one out  we go  weapons are still hot admiral  safe all missilesclose down the doors  thereyou see  never over just one ship  that is not a good sign my friends  she defied us defied the group  its not about in the eye of jupiter  its about her  its like we dont even know them anymore  we may have to so something about this  we may have to do it sooner than later  heras alive  im her mother and im going to get her  sharon baby listen to me okay  we could take a raptor we can fly to the base ship ourselves  i dont i dont care anymore  we cant  well find another way  we will  there is no other way  dont ask me to do this sharon  listen to me  you have always been the strong one  you believed in us when no one else would  im begging you to do this  find the courage to do this for both of us okay  i love you  i love you too   in search of a home  called earth   wait outside yessir  sharons downloading into another body aboard a cylon ship right now isnt she  she begged me  she begged me to do it  gods if youd  seen the look in her eyes when i  she has important information on our defenses  codes procedures the tactical situation down on the planets surface  the cylons have access to all of that as well  she wont betray us  you know that  its why you gave her the uniform  she may not have a choice  did you consider that  she says she could resist that she wouldnt let it happen  shell get hera  and shell come back  thats quite a leap of faith youve made there captain  and if it involved your family only id say it was brave  but youve put the entire fleet in jeopardy are you aware of that  if you hadnt lied  and stolen our baby in the first place  we wouldnt be here at all  i certainly played my part in bringing us to this moment  and theres plenty of blame to throw around and i accept it  and now all of our lives are in the hands of sharon agathon  all we can do is hope that your wife is worthy  of the unconditional trust you place in her captain  and you as well admiral  can you tell me what happened  they wouldnt let me see my daughter  so my husband shot me  it was the only way  well its over now  the important thing is that youre here  hows my daughter  shes getting worse  i want to see her  and then what  what they did to me  stealing my baby  and telling me she was dead  you proved it  heras safer here  and so am i  all right before she went down  starbuck spotted about 15plus chrome jobs advancing on us from here  to get to us the toasters have to come through this canyon  this is a natural choke point  thats where well ambush them  guerilla style  our mission is to hold the temple here  if we fail we blow it up  we fall back to these rendezvous points  and then we head into the mountains and we wait for rescue  well its a good a place as any to die i suppose  what do you think  well  it was a nice day for a walk  snipers  hey take it easy fischer  sarge  sarge  oh gods  oh its just crazy  come on think think  galen its major adama  sir  chief were in position  any luck finding the eye of jupiter  no majori need more time  get

whats wrong  im worried gaius  this is what weve been waiting for  you are the anointed one  chosen by god to look on the faces of the final five cylons  its already written  you will succeed  thats what im afraid of  to know the face of god  is to know madness  the hybrid had looked into the space between life and death  and shes seen things that we cannot conceive of  but shes been driven mad as a result  have faith in god  put your life in his hands  he will guide you to your destiny  im grateful to you  for everything  her destiny will part company from yours gaius  shes not the chosen one  you are  yes i know  i know  ready i got it  okay were set  and now we wait  what happens if the cylons dont dance to the majors tune  what happens is we get splattered all over these rocks  shut upthis is his game not ours  we just do what were told and maybe we get out of here  you really think these civvies can stop them  well they stopped plenty of them on caprica when we were running for our lives  okay three clankers just entered our kill zone  gotta be their recon element  sykes give em the signal  all right showtime showtime  theyre headed our way  dont detonate till theyre all the way in  wait for it  come on you sons of bitches  come on  now now now now  look out  aahman down  cease fire  theyre pulling backtheyre pulling back  oh frak  gods damn it  come on  damn it  oh frak

her  you dont mean that  i know you still care about tyrol and adama  no  im done with that part of my life  i learned that on new caprica  humans and cylons were not meant to be together  we should just go our separate ways  wanna lay down  her bellys as hard as a rock  have you noticed that before  what do you think that means  blocked intestine maybe  our doctors examined her  well your doctors have never examined a child  hera needs to be seen by a human doctor  i need to take her back to galactica  you know that cant happen what this child means to us  what she means to every living cylon  i should have knownshes been planning this all alone  feel her  shes right  bellys as hard as a gourd  if you dont let me take her  the first of a new generation will die  god will never forgive you  maybe cavils right  maybe god never wanted us to have children in the first place  maybe itd be better for you if i just snapped your little neck  dont  please  please dont kill my baby girl  honey oh  i believe the future of the cylon rests with this child  and the others who are gonna come after her  so do i  theres a captured raptor aboard  lets go  weve gotta get you back to galactica  here they come  open fire  tell em to blow the thing  the cylons are closing in  its the major  tyrol tell me youve found the eye of jupiter  no but im getting close major  ive deciphered some more of the glyphs  i got a reference to an eye something about a star and an explosion of some kind  all right cut to the chase chief  do you have the eye of jupiter in your hands or not  no major  oh cylon  its hot  all right chief listen to me thats it  get your people to the rally point and blow the temple  i repeat blow the temple  yes sirdamn it  all right fall back  mathias fall back  fall backfall back  all right thats it everybody  drop what youre doing and get out  that means you too callycome on  leave the geargo  if i only had a little more time  galen  its in the hands of the gods now galen  lets go  theres nothing we can do  the ships structurally intact  okay  that means that the only thing keeping us grounded is the busted flybywire  so  you gotta bypass those bundles with datacord from the com system  and then we  we may have a shot at getting out of here  god  theres only one left  better save it for when you fly us out of here  i cant fly  especially all whacked up on morph  well thats just frakkin great  he wont cheat  hes too honorable  unlike you  yeah unlike me  i love sam  i hate sam  i love lee  i hate lee  gods i have to cheat just to keep the pieces all nice and neat  stay with it  you still gotta walk me through these avionics  the cylons have reached the temple  chief whats your status  im wiring the last detonator  the eye of jupiter has to be somewhere in this temple  theyve wired it with explosives  lets disconnect it  pull out the detonators  quickly  chief blow this thing  you out of your frakkin mind  i cant do it  gaius  yes  help us  yeah  give me the control  this just about does it  frak  what have you done  what have you done  major look  what is that  there it is gaius  it has the answers to all of your questions  thats the eye  what is  oh uh  something the hybrid said uh  sapphire blue  shining like unto a star  danna  you didnt come here looking for earth  you came here looking for something else  picking up massive energy pulse from the central star  sir its a helium flashthe stars going nova  novas gonna obliterate the entire planet in less than an hour  major look  its the mandala from the temple  this is supposed to be happening  thats it  i was staring at it the whole time  the sun is going nova  the nova is the eye of jupiter  all right we can still blow it  we can still blow it  we just gotta make it into orbit  galactica will find us from there okay  ok  good  this is my destiny  to see what lies between life and death  and to look upon the faces of the final five  that cant happen  this is my destiny  sorry danna  the final five  is it really you  you  forgive me i i had no idea  no idea about what  what did you see  what  who was it  it was beautiful  what was  tell meam i one of you  you were right  about what  danna did you see my face  i have to know please  please stay with mestay i have to know  tell me i have to knowdid you see my face  am i a cylon  frak  god tell me the truth before i die  welcome home mrpresident  admiral the cylon fleet just jumped away  they dont wanna be here when that nova shock front gets here  neither do we  launch a rescue mission now  we dont have much time before the nova fries everything in the system  its gonna be a photo finish  all rescue ships from the planet accounted for  count us down  commence ftl commence ftl  jump in three  two  one  i got it  hes not dead  no unfortunately  take him to the bridge  hi  we have to get her to doc cottle right away  okay  xxxxx  hold your firehold your fire  she helped us escape  get out of the way  lieutenant  sharon  i think the chief is right  i think the nova does look like the mandala inside of this temple  do you think the 13th tribe had a vision of what was to come  i dont know what else it could mean  maybe they saw another nova and drew a picture of that  youve seen one nova youve seen them all  there was another nova  seen 4000 years ago around about when the temple might have been built  its 13000 light years from our present position  its a cloud of gas known as the ionian nebula  maybe it was a road sign  showing the direction that they headed to next  so starbuck tell me is that what you gotta do to get a little extra rack time around here  did you just come by to frak with me  actually i wanted to know if you had any uh  pictures of your old apartment on caprica  um  yeah  uh  the locker top shelf  cigar box  why  im curious about something  well i hope you and sharon arent planning on redecorating  cause youre not gonna get any bright ideas from my old place  oh i remember  ive seen better looking train wrecks  oh thank you  but i do remember those paintings you did  what about them  this  was on the temple  whered you get the idea to paint yours  i dont know  it was just something ive been doodling since i was a kid  i liked the pattern  well  they built the temple 4000 years ago  what is it  just something leoben said once  that i had a destiny  that it had already been written  ahh  you know the drill  long deep controlled breathing  at least youll never have to go through this again  the decision wasnt easy but the conclusion was inevitable  your model is fundamentally flawed  no  its not a flaw to question your purpose  is it  to wonder who programmed us the way we think and why  well thats the problem right there  the messianic conviction that youre on a special mission to enlighten us  look at the damage its caused  i would do it all again  yes we know  thats why weve decided to  box your entire line  your consciousness memory every thought your model ever had  are going into cold storage  indefinitely  one must die to know the truth  there are five other cylons brother  i saw them  one day youre gonna see them too  one day  goodbye  brother  one day  brother
