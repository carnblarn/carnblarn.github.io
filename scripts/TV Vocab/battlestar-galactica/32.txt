                previously on battlestar galactica  the raiders are gonna send the signal to activate the virus  on my mark  initiate the computer wipe  im connecting to the network now  congratulations commander  im leaving galactica  not you  im coming back  i said it  i meant it  i understand what its like  to lose someone that you care about deeply  theyre not lost not yet  we have to go back to caprica  given the current situation  im afraid that i have no alternative  but to announce that i am as of now a candidate for the presidency  im gonna lose  yes come in   one minute madam president  thank you tory  no one should be under any illusions about what were going to face here  our final jump will take us intraatmosphere  less than two klicks above the surface  were also expecting to take heavy fire  simulations indicate losses of up to 20 can be expected  thats why this mission has been designated as 2alpha by the command authority  its volunteer only  you want out  nows the time  i know its hard to believe right now but if you have faith  everything will turn out exactly as it should   i dont like to lose  have faith  i am about to face public humiliation  and you are singing the same old song  i am tired of the melody  sorry about the mess its a  bit of a ritual superstition really  i used to do this before testifying at committee hearings  this is what i do i take one  memorize a talking point then tear the card  and let the pieces fall as they may it helps  my father used to break pencils before he went into court  then borrow one from the clerk  break preconceptions work with what you have  you know i like that let me see  i like it   its good  feel better  yeah but what happens if the   moderator doesnt have a pencil  then youre pretty screwed  oh no  i used to get the giggles before debates in high school  yes   its time madam president  thank you tory  many of you dont know is that the captured cylon heavy raider  is capable of much longer jumps than our raptors  in fact we realized early on  that if we could install a heavy raider navigational system aboard one of our raptors  a strike team could make the entire trip back to caprica  in less than ten jumps  now the limiting factor up until now has been our inability  to install the cylon computer with our computer  that obstacle has now been overcome  shes here to help us  shes gonna lay out our navigational markers  and update our jump coordinates does anyone have a problem with that  youve been chosen to lead these people  by almighty god  it will happen  like the baby happened  the one i was destined to protect  dont let your anger drive you into blasphemy gaius  the elections still two weeks away  get your act together  you ready  yeah i was just taking a little nap  chief  this is our mission its our duty to the people we left behind  and if we need to use a cylon to get them back then so be it  this is about trying to get as many survivors off caprica as we can  even so its still 2alpha  anyone wanna eject  commander on deck  dont worry i wont be long i want to hear it too  you just have to really try to think about something serious  that always helps  like what  well like  great  no one has ever attempted a rescue mission from this distance  much less behind enemy lines  youll be making history just by making the attempt  but bring these people back from caprica  and youll be making part of the future  questions  if you guys find earth before we get back will you save us a few seats  earth hell if we find any rock with food and water ill build you guys a bar  all right  see i told you i wouldnt be long mr gaeta turn on the wireless  lets give these people a chance to hear what kind of fun  theyll be missing for the next five days  we are just minutes away from the start of the first presidential debate   between president laura roslin  you okay   and her opponent vicepresident gaius baltar  can i go now   all questions that will be asked  cpl masters  have been submitted by members of the civilian fleet  covering a wide range of topics  so please stay tuned as we get set for the first of two presidential debates  the atmosphere in the auditorium is tense  as we await the arrival of the two candidates and their aides  a real pressure will be on vicepresident baltar tonight  chief  now here comes the vicepresident  gaius baltar into the room  as we await madam president  laura roslin is very much ahead in the polls at this point  we believe that  hes entering the room shortly but still of course waiting for her  he was capable of blindsighting her by announcing his candidacy a month ago  dr baltar of course is one of the most admired and brilliant scientific minds  of his generation and played a critical role in saving the human race  from the cylon threat  yes here comes the president now  laura roslin the president has entered the room  im going to wipe the floor with you gaius  you must be losing your mind again  if thats the best you can come up with youre in a lot of trouble good luck  how you doing you okay  sharon  dont shut me out  not now  something dark is coming helo  i can feel it  i can feel it lurking out there  waiting  what do you mean back on caprica  no  not on the mission  not any specific thing  its more like a dark time  chief  chief  help  season 2  episode 19  lay your burdens down part 1   chief tyrol  i am brother cavill  i understand youve asked for religious counseling  i never really believed in psychotherapy  my father was a priest  i see you thought youd have an easier time with a priest than a real doctor ok  i pray to the gods  every night  but i dont think they listen to me  do you know how useless prayer is  chanting and singing and  mucking about with old halfremembered lines of bad poetry  and you know what it gets you  exactly nothing  are you sure youre a priest  ive been preaching longer than youve been sucking down oxygen  and in that time ive learned enough to know that the gods  dont answer prayers  were here on our own thats the way they set things up  we have to find our own answers  our own way out of the wilderness  without a nice little sunny path all laid out in front of us in advance  thats what im trying to do im trying to find my way  its not going to get better until you see what the problem is  and the problem is youre screwed up  heart and mind  you not the gods or fate or the universe  you  thanks for the pep talk  i just wanted to say  good hunting  thank you sir  yeah its a good plan  its a good plan  sharon should be able to jump you into the atmosphere a couple of   klicks above the surface  down below the  cylon dradis i know the plan lee i wrote it  i gotta go  i hope you find him kara  i really do  so do i  from the colonial dispatch  last nights debate only solidified the perception that  doctor baltar for all his charm is essentially an empty suit  when it comes to matters of substantial policy  its nice to see the press is getting it right for a change  dont forget the radical religious charge is dangerous  it may be a low blow from a desperate man but  its the only issue hes managed to get any traction on he will keep exploiting it  hes gotta come up with something much much bigger than that  if he wants to make it the central issue of his campaign its not going to work  you gotta keep hitting her on the religious thing  every time we go there you score points and we move the polls in our direction  im not sure if youre aware tom  but the mob isnt usually in the habit of electing ungodly apostates  who denigrate people of faith  things are going to turn around youll see  hes right  listen to him  of course  of course how blind im being thank you yes  things are going to turn around youll see what is that advice  well thank you thank for your keen insight  your astounding political acumen you know  im so assured right now tom  im just gonna sit right back and wait for the hand of god  to reach down and change my political fortunes how about that  galactica starbuck  sar squadron confirms readiness check and we are spun up out here  and ready for the first jump  you are go for the jump starbuck  roger that  jump in ten minutes mark  galactica id like to speak with actual  sir  actual go  did i ever say thank you   no  then again that would be a first wouldnt it   thank you  just come back in one piece thatll be thank you enough  good hunting actual out  sar team starbuck set navcon inputs to coordinate recheck  standby for bounce back and stabilization routines  lets do a final check people  xxxx check   xxxx check   i still cant believe you talked me into this  its important  xxxx check   and ill be with you there and back  its you and me from now on no matter what just like we agreed  i know i know  i really appreciate it helo i really do  xxxx check   xxxx check   i just cant get her out of my head  our little girl  is there a problem  xxxx check    racetrack check   xxxx check   wireless check complete  board is green and we are set  sharon youre on  ready  sar team starbuck  standby to jump on my mark  five   here we go  four  three  two  one  commence the first jump  this doesnt look right   no other contacts on dradis  what  man were at the wrong jump coordinates  frack  helo weve lost someone already  its racetrack  so we go back  mission rules say we keep going unless we lose three  so we keep going  racetrack will just have to find her way back to base  its a hell of a way to start though  lets talk about what happened  i cant really believe it  cally i dont  understand how i could do that  to cally its like its a nightmare  she said you were asleep when she found you  were you having a nightmare when she woke you up   i dont remember  been having any recurring dreams lately   no  okay  thats what we in the pray trade  call a lie  and lies arent going to get you anywhere my friend  so skip over the denials and the deceptions  and lets get right down to it shall we   youre having dreams  what are they   tell me about your dream chief  every night every night its the same  for how long   couple weeks  and you were having the same dream when cally woke you up werent you  i dont know i dont remember maybe  it doesnt matter does it  all i remember is cally on the  ground and the blood  she stopped you  by waking you up  she prevented you from carrying out your secret desire to kill yourself  i dont have a secret desire to kill myself  well actually youre right its not a secret  you obviously want to kill yourself question is why  i think there was some kind of glitch in the navcon firmware  bottom line were to hell and gone from where were supposed to be skipper  okay any chance that we can still catch up with them   not a chance  mission rules say we head back  frack me it was the first jump   look you gave me these coordinates  yeah i  back to the barn  i am picking up a large planetary body  its frackin close  whered that come from  hell if i know  so much dradis interference here it didnt even register  hey check this out  atmosphere is nitrogenoxygen  organic molecular spectra  fresh water  hey you know what this is   its habitable  we may have just found a world that can support human life  maybe were not just a bunch of frakups after all  climate readings overall are within human norms  theres some extremes at the poles that we couldnt withstand  but thats not unusual   well done  thank you sir  we got a mottled area here at the river mouth  so its probably a delta  and the chances are weve got significant plant and animal life  so i want a lot of nice low passes across here  heard the pegasus survey mission found wildlife  fruit trees  rivers of milk and honey  you forgot the lakes of ambrosia  most of the planets actually pretty barren  plant and animal life located in a temperate belt around the equator  but the best part is  with all the dradis interference from the nebula  the cylons will probably never find it  who cares about this stupid planet anyway  all this song and dance over nothing  less than 20 of that place actually supports human life so  youre not seeing the big picture  this is your new home  the place where you will lead a new life this is the future gaius  now theres a difference in thought   whats that  oh nothing tom  just  can you imagine if we actually had to live on that thing  you  are a genius  and  pay attention youre about to win the election   im sorry what were you saying tom  we needed an issue  something to set us apart from roslin something to put her clearly  on the wrong side of a major issue that people care passionately about  this is it  permanent settlement on this planet  permanent settlement here  have you lost your marbles  it may look dreary it may be dreary  but its solid ground under your feet and a real sky over your head  youd be surprised what a powerful idea that is to people  cooped up in metal boxes for nine months  you should listen to him gaius  hes a smart sexy man just like you  give up  what  give up on earth  yes  so wed settle here  yes  you know its starting to look like a lovely little planet after all  this is a rest stop  a place to load up on food and water were not settling here obviously  youve heard the captains reports every ship in the fleet has people  begging pleading demanding they get time down on the surface  even if its only for a few hours  well a few hours is one thing but permanent settlements quite another  suddenly baltars holding out hope for breathing real air  growing real food sleeping in a bed instead of a bunk  living in a house instead of a ship  its a fantasy look at the mission reports  all the data indicate that life on this planet would be hard  it would be a struggle to even eke a living out for a few years  todays polls show that hes also making headway with the idea that because  the planet is hidden in a nebula it will provide a refuge from the cylons  what are we now assuming that cylon technology  is not sufficient enough to find this planet we just found it  madam president in my opinion people vote their hopes  not their fears  baltar is offering them what they want to hear  and youre offering them a bitter reality   im offering them the truth  they dont want to hear the truth  theyre tired exhausted  the idea of stopping laying down their burdens  and starting a new life right now is what is resonating with the voters  how well is it resonating  it could turn the entire election around  why are you running   im not  how long are you going to do this  how long are you going to refuse to see whats right in front of your face  forget it im done  what youre leaving  thats right im done  im done dancing around the truth with you  you know whats going on  but you cant or you wont face it so  im not a therapist im not going to hold your hand and help you along  im just trying to get you right with yourself and with your gods  but youre not willing to do it  i dont even know what youre talking about  oh for gods sake chief come on  you think youre a cylon  i am not a cylon  well of course youre not  but thats what youre afraid of isnt it  that you might be a cylon and not even know it just like boomer right  right  thats the thought thats torturing your dreams and crippling your soul  im a cylon just like sharon  and i deserve to die  sharon didnt know  what she was  she just kept  thinking feeling  that she was going to do this terrible thing  but she knew that she had to stop herself before she did  and you think thats what youre going to do some terrible thing  well the truth is you might but not because youre a cylon  because youre a human being and human beings do terrible things all the time  but how do you know im human  oh well maybe because im a cylon  and ive never seen you at any of the meetings  theres not much more i can do for you youre going to have to go back to work  and try and leave all of this behind you  no i  i cant  i cant go back and face the deck people again  and cally  well youd better thats the only family youve got  just know that thats your family and that they love you  even cally especially cally  if you doubt your humanity and your essential nature as a human being  all you need to do is look to them for the salvation youve been seeking from the gods  the gods lift up those who lift each other chief  sar team starbuck we are set here  stand by for final jump to caprica remember we are going very low to the surface  be prepared for wind shear rain storms  anything  roger that starbuck  ready  ready  here we go  jump  sar team starbuck form up on me  copy that skipper  any cylons helo  nothing on dradis  wait a minute wait a minute  missing a raptor im only reading 17 out there were missing  raptor 612  thats toughguy and carousel  what they jumped to the wrong coordinates  no no im picking up their transponder so they made it  bearing 827 carom 443  about half a klick from here that would put them  oh my gods  where helo talk to me  they jumped inside the mountain  damn  sar team starbuck  weve lost raptor 612 we are proceeding without them  follow me  roger that starbuck  i would think that my position  and the position of my campaign is abundantly clear  madam president you have 30 seconds to respond  well my initial response is there he goes again  once again  ladies and gentlemen doctor baltar is distorting the real issues before us  the issue here the real question is not  allowing the scriptures to dictate the policy of this government the question is  do the scriptures contain real world relevance  do they contain the information necessary to guide us to  a safer home than some completely unknown planet that weve just now discovered  obviously my answer to that question is yes  i have always and will continue to feel  the scriptures hold real world relevance  mr vicepresident the next question is for you  how do you respond to the charges that  you seized the idea of permanent settlement on this planet as an opportunistic gamble  some would say as to be construed as a desperate move from a campaign  that was falling behind on every poll  well you know that is  that is an excellent question in fact jim thank you  and im only too glad to have the opportunity to respond to it  you see i have long been a proponent in the search for earth  the promise of perhaps finding not only a new home  but also the prospect of discovering our long lost  brothers and sisters of the 13th colony is a powerful one  and one i have believed in heart and soul  but the trouble is  the cylons continue to follow us  as they have done every step of the way  since the destruction of the colonies  and if we have a chance to change this dynamic  to stop this deadly chase  should we take it  my answer is yes  thank you madam president 30 seconds  theres no assurance  none whatsoever  that the cylons dont already know about this planet  that they dont make regular stops here looking for us  and that in fact  they arent simply waiting for us to settle on the surface   so they can  i have to respond to that  i simply have to respond to that  ill give you 15 seconds  what youve seen right now ladies and gentlemen is another example  of the president using fear to drive her campaign  fear  fear of the gods  fear of the cylons fear of fear itself  is it not time to stop being afraid  im asking all of us  to stop running from our lives  and start living them  thank you  thank you that is all we have time for today id like to thank  both the candidates for their frankness today very exciting debate  this concludes the cycle of the debates for the presidency  the polls will open in three days  please vote thank you and good night   not your night i guess  why dont you go frack yourself  with me now is campaign manager for doctor baltar  mr tom zarek tom welcome  you were in there with us today what was your impression  well i  thought doctor baltar did exceptionally well  laid out his vision of the future and offered the people a way to end  the suffering and terror that defines so many of their lives  on the other hand i found myself wondering how  roslins arguments against settlement could possibly win  lets figure out where we are karl  resistance base camp were still  another klick ahead  movement 1100  friendlies  you got a samuel t anders there  is there a kara thrace there  if there is  you tell her she took her good sweet time getting here  friendlies  what took you so long  we have marines in raptors  were gonna get you and your people out of here okay  as good as your word  yeah good as my frackin word  what did you think i was going to leave you here  now you feel like a big frackin idiot  all right just shut up and save us already okay  people this is nice but we have toasters on our ass  where are the rest of your people  this is it  toasters hit our base camp this morning  i lost half my crew  incoming  back to the raptors  no  shell trajectories are coming between us and the raptors were cut off
