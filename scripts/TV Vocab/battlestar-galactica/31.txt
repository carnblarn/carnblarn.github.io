                previously on battlestar galactica  there are survivors on caprica  a resistance movement  weve been fighting the cylons  hitting them where we can  now it looks like theyre here to stay  theyre rebuilding caprica  the first sharon was a sleeper agent  didnt realize she was a cylon  until her programming kicked in  im sharon  but im a different sharon  and im here to help  now ive decided youre an expression of my  subconscious mind playing itself out during my waking states  so im  only in your head   im pregnant helo  were gonna have a child  sharon is going to bear  our child  an honor for which she is hardly deserving but one doesnt question gods will  cylons reincarnate  it makes sense doesnt it   all our memories are downloaded into a brandnew body  were as good as new  death becomes a learning experience  wait there has to be another way out of here  i mean you must have an escape plan  youre not about to be destroyed by your own bombs are you  how are you leaving   gaius  i cant die  when this bodys destroyed my memory  my consciousness will be transmitted to a new one  ill just wake up somewhere else in an identical body  you mean theres more out there like you   there are 12 models  im number 6  i dont want to die  get down  do you love me   where  i was in a house  but youre not in a house any longer  youre back with us  youve been reborn  i died  i died  thats right you were in a house it was destroyed  a nuclear blast  but that is all over now you have been downloaded into a new body  gaius  gaius was in the house  gaius baltar   yes is he alive   is he   im not really here  no one can see me but you  dont let them know  six  would it trouble you if doctor baltar were dead   if they know  how you feel about me  itll be a problem  it would be  unfortunate  if he died  he was so helpful  very helpful  your mission was a resounding success  it completely disabled the colonial defenses  the attack succeeded beyond our most optimistic projections thanks to you  youre a machine im not  i know theres pain but breathe ride through it  youre going to be okay trust me  youre in gods hands were all here with you  thats it  this will pass trust me  everythings gonna be all right  welcome home little sister  were here  were going to take care of you  were proud of you sharon  and we love you  episode 18 season 2 downloaded  i was thinking it symbolized rebirth  a new beginning  its a memorial  do you know how many people died in this park during the attack   how many people in this park alone   its gonna be lovely isnt it   sorry  a new place to relax collect your thoughts  how you doing   im a little stiff  im still trying to get used to this body  i mean i know its identical but  even after all this time i still feel awkward  i was a klutz too always knock things over  forever tripping over things and  you know what  you get over it  and you know what this is a great chance to cleanse  you got a new body a new life  and anything that youve built up like anxieties or remorse or guilt  just let it wash away  i cant tell you how thankful i am  youve been a really big help to me  no its me whos thankful  we all are  you are a war hero we could not have won without you  excuse me  i just wanted to say its an honor to have you here on caprica with us  what you did  well its inspiring  thank you  how you doing   freezing  i cant feel my legs  thats the epidural  what happened   you passed out and started bleeding again but everythings gonna be all right  like hell it is  i find it absolutely amazing  you people went to all the trouble to appear human and didnt upgrade the plumbing  you have a detached placenta  baby has to come out now or we could lose you both  im gonna to have to ask you to step back please  shes tachycardiac and her blood pressures dropping  shes hemorrhaging again were gonna to have to make the cut now  sharon can you hear me   helo  still cant get used to this  well youre a hero of the cylons now  youre our first celebrity  no im just another six  youre too modest im just another three and theyre fives and  or eights  but you everyone calls you caprica six  like youre the only six on the planet  and what you did was incredibly difficult  seduce a man so emotionally and physically so that he grants you access to  all the most closely guarded secrets of his people i mean  that mission could be profoundly disturbing  disturbing   she means sleeping with me or killing billions of people cause id rather thought  it was difficult at times  see nobody here can possibly understand  what youve been through which is why we need your help  theres another cylon whos been having trouble reintegrating after a download  another hero actually  an eight  still insists on calling herself sharon  and you thought i could help  im still having  im having problems of my own  caprica you dont understand she really needs your help  if we dont turn her around soon theres talk of boxing her  putting her memories in cold storage  you cant be serious  thats a charming way to deal with emotional problems  one might almost call it inhuman  thats right you are  all right look it is a last resort but she has been regressing  please  shes living up there in that apartment its the one she had when  securitys minimal  two centurions patrol out front  the third bullethead watch the perimeter  bullethead walking perimeter makes random changes to his patrol  be tough to get past him  all right so we go under him  the storm drain leads directly to the garage underneath the cafe  theyll be dozens of skin jobs inside  shes not breathing  suction it  right away  whats going on  where are you taking her   her lungs arent fully developed she needs oxygen support  but shes alive right  right   theres your answer  now you get the hell out of here we have to stop the mother bleeding or  you here to kick me out   no  youre here to help me with my adjustment problems  i could save you some time  this is home  im not leaving  i lived on caprica for two years  i knew what i was  pretended to be human but i knew  if you knew what you were and you lived on caprica you know what that makes you  a really good liar  start with the elephants  these are beautiful  ithacan   handcarved  my mother gave them to me the day i left for the fleet academy  is this her   supposed to be  course none of its real  all fabricated for my mission its all a lie  following gods path is never easy  dont get religious with this one what are you thinking   do you think i care about your god   look god loves you  this is love  these people love me  i love them  i didnt pretend to feel something so i could screw people over  i love them  and then i betrayed them  i shot a man i love fracked over another man ruined his life  and why   because im a lying machine  im a fracking cylon  sorry i didnt mean to  ive got bandages in there  nicely done  you timed it perfectly  scratch your face with the side of your fingernail  the moment the glass hits the wall  never saw a cylon show fear before  especially the sixes usually so hardcore  feign fear and emotional vulnerability youre very good you know  but im better  let me help you  im different  im different  im more like you  im more like you  i had someone i met here  a man  i loved him and i think he couldve loved me eventually  half a cigarette should give us 2 or  any longer and we risk them finding the charges before they go off  is it two minutes or three   about to find out  this is a risky operation just to nail a couple dozen skin jobs  we cant killem  theyll just download into a new body and  i mean whats the point   that skin job with starbuck  sharon they called her  she said that when they download they remember everything  right up until the end  these skin jobs are gonna remember being blown into tiny little pieces  its gotta hurt  yeah i hope it hurts a lot  because sooner or later the message sinks in there is no safe place not even a cafe  so if you want to quit living through hell and dying over and over again  then get the frack off our planet  three minutes ten seconds  boom  this house was on a bluff over a lake  always loved the view  sunlight on the water  its my favorite spot in the universe  yeah its magical  too bad you nuked it  after i downloaded  i went back to the ruins of his house  why   like you i was looking for some sort of connection to him  found a few of his things even held onto them for awhile but  i realized they were keeping me from truly embracing my new life  so whatd you do with them   i burned them  but i felt liberated  yeah its a beautiful story isnt it   shame its all a pack of lies  so who was he  this man you loved  maybe youve heard of him  gaius baltar  doctor baltar   yeah  he gave you access to the colonial defense grid  he was the one who betrayed us   us oh i love it  this one thinks shes more human than cylon  just like someone else i know  does he still work for the cylons   what   on galactica   hes alive   hes the vicepresident of the colonies  you didnt know that   if their baby does survive the question is  what do we do with it   do   what are you suggesting  that we throw it out of an air lock   i dont make suggestions mr baltar  if i want to toss a baby out an air lock id say so  its really gratifying to know that infanticides not on the table  do i have to point out that this is not a baby   its a machine  no its half machine half human  i suggest we all keep that half in mind  cylons went through a great deal of trouble to create this thing  should go without saying that if its good for them  its gonna be bad for us  i completely agree  and i take it as a given we cant turn it over to sharon to raise  that would be disastrous  theres still another factor to consider here  theres cylons aboard this fleet  if they find out this things been born  theyre gonna make a play for it  you can see where this is headed gaius  were gonna have to take our child  hello hera  shes got quite a grip on her  you dont like it in there do you hera   you gotta stay in till your lungs get stronger  shes our little girl  we made her  it almost makes you want to believe in the cylon god  almost  i love you so completely  its clear  here take this  lets move  here you go  why do you think they kept it from you   is the wrong question  the right question is why did she get me to work with you knowing  she knew i had feelings for gaius  knew that i had trouble letting go of him  she mustve known it would trigger those feelings and those memories  shes fracking with you  cant you see that   but why   its so perfectly obvious  you know for a selfaware cybernetic lifeform sometimes you can be  oh for god sake  careful  everything okay   fine  just talking with sharon here  yeah  what about   she asked me to move out  you know what  which is what weve been asking her for weeks  i was kind of hoping that youd see the light after talking to our friend here  she is lying unfortunately  she has no wish to see sharon cured  theyre just gonna do it  theyre going to box her  how many cylons up in the cafe   full house at least 40  three minutes ten seconds  weve just made a breakthrough  shes agreed to move out of her apartment  didnt you sharon   yeah  im moving out of the apartment  when   whenever  what about now   ill help  the apartment is right upstairs  sure  let me let me just get some things  good work six mustve been some chat  yes we had a lot to talk about  shes right behind you  i know  this is not a debate  this child will not be raised by the cylon  and i can not risk cylon agents getting their hands on it ive made my decision  what i need from you doctor is your help  fine i dont like it but have it your way  i need it immediately  well have to find somebody suitable ill have to work up a list of names  each of them is capable each of them is anonymous  and each can be trusted  thought of everything havent you   i hope so  are you all right sharon   what happened   an explosion building came down on us  looks like the stairwell saved us  wheres six   her bodys dead  no not yet  help me out here  wouldve been better if the explosion had killed her  theres nothing we can do about the pain until we get her out of here  hey six  i can get a cross beam and put you out of your misery  im not gonna give up on life again  its your choice  where the heck are we anyway   must be in the garage  north entrance must be that way  im gonna start digging  hang in there  youre gonna be okay  we have a survivor  yeah  hang on buddy  well get you out  fresh air coming from down there  thanks i though i was a goner  frackinhuman you know he probably set that explosion  what for the resistance  why   no military value to the cafe  but humans dont respect life the way we do  no  i wont let you kill him  shes right  dont kill him  why not   why not kill him   youve already killed billions of people  do you honestly believe one more body is gonna weigh any heavier on your conscience  which is something that you dont have  do you   we should interrogate him  find his accomplices  okay  you can let go now sharon  whats this   looks like colonial fleet id  thrace kara  starbuck   she was on caprica a couple of weeks ago  she escaped with the help of another sharon  if she gave him this he meant something to her  well then its sweet  you have it in your hand  hard physical proof of one persons love for another  if only you felt this deeply about us  i did  i do  i love you gaius  wheres the tangible proof   i dont understand  she was doing so well  no she wasnt  i tried to tell you that  her lungs were never fully developed  she finally went into respiratory distress we couldnt get her intubated in time and  we lost her im sorry  i shouldve been here  sharon  listen youve lost a lot of blood  you murdered her  sharon come on  who ordered it   adama  the president  who   i dont kill patients  we did the best we could  but shes dead and thats all there is to it  i should be able to release the ashes to you in a few hours  murderer  sharon  die  youre all murderers  stay back  youre all murderers  get her out of here  give me my baby  you let them murder our child  i am so sorry  i tried i tried my best  gods will was that our child should survive  his will was that she would lead the next generation of gods children  his will was that you would protect her  yes  you have committed a monstrous and unforgivable sin  and now you and your entire wretched race are going to suffer gods vengeance  shes so beautiful  i dont know how to thank you  when i lost my baby i didnt know how i could go on  well im glad things worked out for you and this little girl  i cant believe somebody would give up this little angel  you understand maya that this adoption requires absolute secrecy  the mother is a pegasus officer and must remain anonymous  for political and religious reasons  you have my word  maya  you wont mind if i drop in occasionally  of course not  good  go  thank you  i know how awful this was for you but trust me  it was imperative  as far as the cylons know this child no longer exists  that is a good good thing  is this what youre looking for   you can have it here  what are you doing   just making it easy for him to get what he wants  come on ill give you a head start  im fine where i am  hey theyre coming for us  and you  theyll be very interested in you  leave him alone  sharon  youre a hero of the cylons  now youre just a broken machine who thinks shes a human  but youre not a human sharon  and you never will be  yeah well at least im not a murderer  i have a conscience  and i know the difference between right and wrong  a murderer is exactly what you are  life is short  but the next ones not  let your heart adrift and your soul will get caught  i love you gaius  my heart and soul are yours  theyre nearly here  you know why they wanted you to work with sharon   so youd lose your mind  theyre gonna box you darling  just like theyre gonna box sharon  were dangerous  what   sharon and i  were celebrities in a culture based on unity  no  our voices count  more than hers more than others  two heroes of the cylons right   two heroes with different perspectives on the war  perspectives based on our love of two human beings  thats why she wanted me to work with you  so that youd tell me that gaius was still alive  she wanted me to lose my mind  no youre corrupted by your experiences  youre a waste  believe the lies  ignore the truth listen to me i will show you the proof  speak from your heart  say the things that you know to be true  jealously  murder vengeance theyre all sins in the eyes of god  thats what you and i know  thats what they dont want to hear  because then theyd have to rethink what theyre doing  theyd have to consider  that maybe the slaughter of mankind was a mistake  god loves me  see you again soon  looks like theyre almost here  you should get out of here while you can the fresh air coming in might lead you out  is this some kind of trick   you can stay and be tortured if you want  your call  who are you   what kind of people are you   i dont know  hey wait  how long till she downloads and tells them what happened   we had a lot of people in the cafe  at least 36 hours till they get to her  long enough  long enough for what   to change things for the better  what are you talking about   i have never  loved anyone more in my life  than i love you now  our people need a new beginning  a new way to live in gods love  without hate without all the lies  all they need is for someone to show them the way  someone like two heroes of the cylons  im with you  we found them  theyre alive  yes we are  were alive
