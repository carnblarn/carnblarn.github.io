burdens of this life are with us but a short time  for lt zak adama son of william and caroline adama  brother of lee the time was too short  cleric but we take comfort in knowing his life was willingly given  in service to all of us  cleric we honour them for that  cleric and thus it falls upon us to repent our sins  and with the help of the lords of kobol  make our own lives worthy of that gift  cleric and now we commit his body to the ground from which we were all made  elosha secure in the knowledge  that we will be reunited with them  in a better world to come    so say we all

teach combat tactics  you know i dont know if id be of any use to you   i wasnt the most patient  lets get down to it  this is about zak  it was not your fault  you had nothing to do with what happened  it was an accident  lee zak failed basic flight   what  or at least he should have but he didnt  because i passed him  his technique was sloppy and he had no feel for flying  but i passed him  because he and i  because i felt something and i let it get in the way of doing my job  starbuck and i couldnt fail him  zak passed basic flight  adama he was trained and ready to sit in that cockpit  what happened to him couldve happened to any qualified pilot   you know thats true  right  you did your job to the best of your ability thats all i can ask  i need new pilots and i want you to train them  i can do that    just give them the attention and the professionalism that you gave my son  and theyll be one hell of a squadron  ten cubits says she takes him this time  youre on

witty  have you ever heard of chamalla extract  doc cottle gods youre one of those roslin what if it works  all the evidence on chamalla is anecdotal  doc cottle its nothing but a bunch of loose talk and false hope  roslin ill take that as a yes  all right  ill put out a med request to the civilian fleet  maybe theres some other wideeyed dreamer out there  with a secret horde of chamalla extract in their luggage  doc cottle put your clothes back on now roslin thank you  doc cottle and for what its worth  i would seriously consider prayer  boonie jumpers shuttle jockies  and a fleet academy washout this is the best that you could come up with   diamonds in the rough  yeah right  apollo theyre the most qualified pilots in the fleet  starbuck great  starbuck attention on deck  that means get on your feet nuggets  you are joining the colonial fleet boys and girls not some afterschool club  seats  starbuck pilots call me starbuck but you may refer to me as god  youve all flown before but youre about to enter a whole new world  so pay attention  we dont have any flight simulators on board  so were putting you into the cockpit today  this is the viper mark ii  its as manoeuvrable as a jackrabbit and can flip end for end  in 035 seconds  youve never flown anything remotely like it so dont think that you have  starbuck today well do basic launch approach and landing manoeuvres  and anyone not paying attention is liable to end up  as a puddle or something to be hosed out of the cockpit by the chief of the deck  shes laying it on a little thick  starbuck costanza right costanza yes god sir  not anymore from now on your name is hot dog  and when god speaks hot dog you listen  maybe if you had learned that at the academy you wouldnt have washed out  sit up  lso viper 791 galactica you are cleared for approach  lso speed 175 port bay hands on approach  checkers green call the ball  i have the ball  starbuck easy on the throttle kat  starbuck are you listening to me dont chase the lights okay  kat roger starbuck starbuck kat dont chase the lights  set it by the numbers and correct with thrusters  lso waveoff  punch it kat  worse than awful wretched beyond belief actually  starbuck you call yourselves pilots  itll take the knuckle draggers a week to pound your divots out of the flight deck   with due respect sir thats unfair  yes sir this was only our first day  no its your last  it would be criminal to let any of you near a viper again  so pack your gear and get the hell off my ship youre done  what are you doing here kara   you cant wash them out on their first day  i just did  look i got 40 vipers and 21 pilots thats it  we are sitting ducks until we finish waterops  we cant even maintain a cap and gods forbid the cylons show up  gods forbid lets bring in the next group of candidates  the next group has never even been in a cockpit   theyre starting basic flight  then they start basic flight  because that group is done it says so right there  maybe you should read it again  apollo lt thrace this is not a request starbuck well capt adama  i am the flight instructor sir my word is scripture sir  starbuck i will not repeat not pass another student who isnt ready  so thats what this is about  its not them its zak  careful  step back      adama starbuck says they cant cut it they cant cut it  shes not giving them a chance its day 1  shes one of the finest pilots ive ever seen in my life  one day in the cockpit is all she needs to know if they can hack it or not  adama she got that apollo im not arguing that sir  im just saying that i think shes letting her personal feelings cloud her judgment  please sit down captain  adama what are those feelings  about zak   weve talked about zak  you did  adama weve talked about a lot of things  weve been aboard this ship for over two years we know each other very well  when i asked her to be the instructor  i knew it was going to release a lot of loose baggage  she acknowledged it shes a professional shell do her job  okay  im just saying that you should talk to her  apollo shes walking around with a lot of emotion  she almost decked me in the rec room  right you wouldnt smile if you were there   ill talk to her  thank you  personally  i think shes trying to work out her guilt over what she did for zak  i think shes making up for it by beating up on these guys  guilt over what  what did she do for zak   i thought you just said  what did she do  its not my place to say and ive already said more than i should have   youll have to ask her im sorry  captain just  dad youll have to ask her  zak i dont want any special treatment  not from my father and certainly not from you  you passed  by the skin of your teeth but you passed  dualla attention pass the word to lt thrace  lt thrace please report to the cos quarters  yes come in  adama lee was just here before starbuck i knew it  he thinks you washed out  the nuggets without giving them a chance  they didnt cut it thats it  he thought you were letting personal feelings cloud your judgment  starbuck really adama your feelings about zak  thats not the case  okay  adama he said something else  he said something that i would like to ask you directly  adama he said that you might be feeling guilty about something that you did for zak  what did you do for him  starbuck i dont know ask lee adama im asking you  i dont know  i dont really know what he was talking about so  dont fence with me kara  i love you like a daughter i dont deserve that  zak failed basic flight  he wasnt a bad pilot he just had no feel for flying  and when it came to his final checkride he busted  three of the test manoeuvres  and i should have flunked him but i didnt  the bottom line is that your son  didnt have the chops to fly a viper  and it killed him  adama he told me that you were an amazing instructor  and that he was involved with you and that it was serious  he asked me to come to his graduation from flight school   to watch him get his wings  i know i read the letter  i see  then maybe you can tell me what he was hinting at  surprise about you  we were going to  you know what its not important   i dont want that to  you were engaged right  you did it because you were engaged    because i made a mistake  and because i was just  i was so in love with him  and i let that get in the way of doing my job  he just wanted it so much and i didnt want to be the one who crushed him  reinstate the trainees to flight status  i will   i just want you to understand that i  do your job  yes sir  and walk out of this cabin while you still can    unpack your gear you are all returned to flight status  were going to try this again  those of you who can be trained to safely fly the viper mark ii will pass  those of you who cannot will be cut  starbuck its my job to figure out which is which without personal feeling either way  and im going to do my job  kat chuckles hot dog youre up first  preflight briefing in 20 minutes  chuckles where the hell are you going hot dog stay on me  hot dog target acquired and destroyed  not bad hot dog but you left your leader behind  kat looks like youre having a bad day hot

little manoeuvre called thorch weave  ill be damned whats got into starbuck  tigh she actually sounds like a real instructor for a change  tigh she may actually make viper pilots out of some of those
