officers and the crew of the pegasus  its a pleasure to see all of you  welcome back to the colonial fleet    capt taylor  kara thrace captain taylor  admiral  im fairly burning with questions i hope you dont mind if i just dive in  please how did you find us  well we were tracking a cylon fleet  we were trying to predict their movements which seemed rather random initially  until we realized that they were just jumping to systems with natural resources  so we began to scout those systems ourselves  hoping to carry out hitandrun attacks on their fleet  but instead of finding the cylons we found you  so youve been attacking their fleet  well you know what they say about the best defense  how did you avoid the initial cylon attack on the colonies  ill have another if you dont mind  galacticas finest    beats the hell out of the nickel tour thank you  i figured if youd seen one old battlestar youd seen them all  yeah well shes an old one  i cant believe the cylons didnt kick your ass  up one side and down the other in this bucket  sorry  and just for that  you have to skip this round    we were docking at scorpion fleet shipyard  we were getting ready to go in for a threemonth overhaul  most of the crew was getting ready for extended shore leave and family reunions  xo had the deck  i was down in my quarters wrapping up some paperwork  and getting ready to pack up to go home to tauron  and thats when the cylons attacked  they hit the shipyard with three maybe four nukes  five ships two of them battlestars  they were destroyed right there  and by the time i got to back to clc  i discovered that id lost over 700 men  my gods  we were completely defenseless so i ordered a jump  to where  wherever  nowhere just jump  adama blind jump  couldve ended up anywhere gutsy call  no desperate move  didnt see any other choice  well im sure you have quite a story to tell yourself  but i wont make you go through it right this very minute  you can send up your logs when you get the chance  yes sir  is something wrong  no  i sometimes forget about the rules of military protocol  adama adm cain is my superior officer  she will take complete command of the entire fleet  i was wondering how to broach that topic  trust me when i say  that while the chain of command is strict it is not heartless  and neither am l  this is your ship  and i have no desire to interfere with galacticas internal affairs  i appreciate it admiral  madam president you look like i just shot your dog  no i just just the commander and l weve been through a lot  excuse me madam president  if youll both excuse me  admiral i cant tell you how grateful we are to have you here  thank you for finding us  madam president  the secretary of education  shes come a long way  im sure  so tell me about adm cain  officers discretion  of course  we were going after what we thought was a little cylon comm relay  easy target right  turns out it wasnt a comm relay at all it was a staging area  full of 15 squadrons of raiders    adm cain ordered our xo to attack  those two were real close hed served with her for years  but heres the thing  he refused the order  adm cain  we have a cylon prisoner aboard this ship  really  we have one on ours as well  ours has proven to be an excellent source of intelligence  shes been very cooperative  the vice president dr baltar has been working with her  tigh what did she do she asked for his gun  shot him in the head with it in front of the whole crew  and then she turned to me  what did you do  i ordered the frakking attack what do you think i did    no  no im just joking  im just kidding you know  it gives me no pleasure to have to take command bill  i want you to know that  dont give it a moments thought admiral      is this a scorecard  you guys put scorecards on the side of your ships  like you dont keep score  you dont see me painting them on the side  iike im bragging to the whole frakking universe  thats 48 kills right there  thats special do you have caps and tshirts too    wheres the galactica cag  right here  lets hear the rundown on this squadron of yours captain  i see you dont keep track of your kills you should start  encourages morale gets the competition going esprit de corps  well thats one philosophy  its adm cains philosophy  that means its your philosophy now captain  the name of my commander is adama  it should be pretty easy to remember cause its my name  yeah  ill keep that in mind daddys boy  lets see your ordnance lists  they made me head of the cylon branch and my main focus is on cylon detection  we have our own cylon prisoner  id like you to examine it as soon as possible  see if you can glean anything from it  i wonder who the cylon will turn out to be  a stranger a familiar face  a trusted friend who suddenly turns out to be the enemy  did you hear what i just said  yes  id be really id be very happy to examine the prisoner  commander  admiral admiral i am so sorry  that is one ugly baby  excuse me  do you mind if i take a look around im laird pegasus deck chief  yeah tyrol  thanks for sending over these parts yeah look at whatever you like  ddg62s ill be  i designed these engines i thought they phased them out over 10 years ago  youre an aeronautical engineer yeah i was  then the war happened and i got drafted to being the deck chief on pegasus  so youre really a civilian howd that happen  i was on the scylla and we got picked up by the pegasus  things happen  mind if i crawl around inside here i heard you designed this yourself  id love to see how you did it  yeah go ahead  pegasus has been resupplying galactica  from its own reserve for military operations  which l completely support  but when will some of these supplies start getting out to the fleet  adm cain has assured me that those supplies are on their way  well at least shes taking your phone calls i cant even get her to answer mine  ill bring it to her attention  how are you doing with all this  she outranks me its as simple as that  you know if president adar stepped off that raptor id be elated  grateful to have someone take over and yet  i dont want go to the and yet part  ive been taking orders my entire career this is no different  well then commander thank you  we would appreciate all the help you can give us  you shall receive it  sounds like you were both drunk  no question but he wasnt lying i can tell you that right now  well i hope you wont jump to conclusions wait for all of the facts  context matters  context  that woman shot an officer right in front of the crew  we shot down an entire civilian transport  with over  it says so right there that was completely different  and we dont know there were people on that ship  which is why i hope the admiral reads the complete log  and understands the context  we should ask adm cain for her logs just so we can put her in context  wouldnt that be nice  dont get too close it killed seven of my crew  you want my guards to come in with you  feeling scared gaius  want the big bad soldiers to protect you from the mean old cylon prisoner  no i think well be just fine thank you  oh my god  no6 my god gaius  its me  look what theyve done to her  open the door now please    she mustve struggled  she must have fought back  that doesnt justify this stop it  hello  hello can you hear me  shes obviously been abused  tortured balter yes  but theres no obvious sign of head trauma    voluntary eye movements suggest conscious thought  cant you stop being a scientist for one moment  and look at the abused woman lying there in front of you  now listen  i know this must be very difficult for you  dont patronize me  im not patronizing you im trying to reason with you  if im going to help her i have to understand her first  will you help her gaius  i will do everything i can  after all  she is remarkably similar to someone i care about a great deal  i think it would be best  if you left us alone for a time  it suffered no serious head injuries therefore no physical damage  to its neural pathways or cognitive reasoning centers  but its quite clearly traumatized  which would suggest that its current condition is psychological in nature  had you thought of that no  it shows that the cylon consciousness is just as susceptible  to the same pressures and cleavages as the human psyche  and can be manipulated in the same fashion  simply put admiral you have already used the stick  its time to use a carrot  please give the doctor whatever he needs aye sir  commander having read your logs  it appears that youve been through quite an ordeal  weve had our moments  well you did yourselves proud  thank you admiral  as i told you we were tracking a cylon fleet when we found galactica  and now that ive had a chance to compare their route to your ships logs  its quite clear that theyve been following you  our recon so far tells us  that the fleet is composed of two base ships  about a dozen or so support ships  and one large vessel that we are still unable to identify  its this large ship here that im interested in  whats its function is it a commanding control ship  a raider factory  possibly whatever it is the cylons are protecting it  this is what id call a tempting target  and here i was getting ready to do a whole song and dance  about combining resources for a joint strike mission  any chance of hitting the cylons where it hurts  my pleasure  ill have apollo coordinate with your cag  which leads me to the next subject commander  im going to integrate the crews  and im starting by reassigning capt adama to the pegasus air wing  i have a team that works very well together  lets just cut through it shall we  after reviewing your logs it is my judgment  that having your son as galactica cag has been a grave mistake  hes been insubordinate even mutinous  and these are direct quotes from your logs by the way  and i dare say hes not the only one with disciplinary problems  theres a kara thrace who habitually strikes fellow officers and disobeys orders  this lt agathon has fraternized with  and evidently impregnated an enemy agent  lets not even discuss your xo  so  there is a complete list of transfers  i thought you said you had no desire to interfere with my command  im saving your command bill  youre way too close to these officers  and its blinding you to their weaknesses  and to the damage that theyre doing to unit cohesion and then to morale  i dont agree  well that is certainly your right  you have your orders  transfer to pegasus  why the frak should we do that  because those are your orders  we cant just let her come here and change our entire roster  on the eve of a major cylon operation  shes trying to break up the team  cause their cag has a stick up his ass  thats enough  youre officers act like it  shes given you an order you will carry it out  permission to speak freely you may not  weve all gotten used to bending the rules having our way  ietting things slide well thats over  you wear the uniform you will accept the rules that go with it  youve been transferred  pack your gear and report to the pegasus cag  dismissed  this is a photo recon mission  we are interested in one cylon ship in particular  which is larger than anything weve encountered before  analysis to date suggests they will be in this star system next  we will hide behind this moon  which has an abnormally large magnetotail and will mask our dradis signatures  well power down hide near the surface wait for the fleet to pass by  starbuck you have something to add  your plan sucks  and the cylons arent stupid  that moons a blind spot theyll never go near it  you really want to get close  you got to use the stealth ship we constructed aboard galactica  the homemade tin can stinger thats enough  starbuck youre off this mission  whiplash thumper get your optical gear ready  apollo youll pilot the raptor with me  your jacket says you qualified in one remember how to fly it  yes sir good dismissed    they expect us to take this lying down  now youre flying a frakking raptor its humiliating  a surveillance package  go get the blackbird take some pretty pictures of our cylon ship  copy that  cheers everybody all yeah  wheres the blackbird a lt thrace took it out  she said adm cain ordered a performance check out  what gage hey chief  you deserve a frakking medal we havent seen booze for months  this place is a frakking party  vireem i heard you guys even got yourselves a cylon  heard shes a hot one too  get me some of that cylon stuff  a little of the oh yeah oh yeah  hey you know what thats enough guys just shut up  sensitive you got a soft spot for the little robot girl do you    who the hell are you  remember when thorne put that please disturb sign up on the brig there  gage i got in line twice i hear that  remember she was just lying there with that blank look on her face like  hey do you mind  man 1 ooh frisky  that hurts  what is the function of this ship  i dont know here take a closer look  what makes it so important  why would two base stars be tasked to protect it      i dont know  do you think thorne will give us a chance at this one too  no i heard him say hes gonna have to break her in a little first  who the hells this thorne lt thorne sir cylon interrogator  rides them hard and keeps them talking  your little robot girl is in for quite a ride  heehaw    think about it we need to go  what the frak  okay  no  move it get out of the way  move get out of the way      get off her  get off her now    motherfrakker  freeze  dont either of you frakking move dont move  dont either of you frakking move  dont move    get down  on your knees  hands behind your head now  hands behind your head  do it now do it    guard hes dead    pilot pegasus raptor 923 weve cleared galactica  and are en route with prisoners and the body of lt thorne  eta to pegasus three minutes  adama the assault happened here  they should face a court martial on galactica  commander i am the senior convening authority present  and theyll be tried on pegasus  theyre my men one of my men is dead  fine we both have strong feelings about the case  adama that only underlines the need for an impartial trial  you mean an independent tribunal  because according to your logs commander  you dissolved an independent tribunal when you didnt like the verdict  and if im not mistaken chief tyrol was on trial there as well  that was a different time yes indeed it was  ill be in touch commander thank you  thank you now get out    the food is yours  its not a trick  im not gonna take it away at the last second  you know l  im just going to talk right now  i dont expect you to say anything  back on caprica before the attack  and sometimes  i forget there was a world before the attack  i knew someone a woman  unlike any other woman id ever known  she was unique  beautiful clever  intensely sensual  when she wasnt in my bed  she was in my thoughts  she was a cylon  and she changed my life in a very real very fundamental way  in that i have quite literally never stopped thinking about her  because i love her  to this very day i love her  and she looks exactly like you  my name is gaius baltar  and im here to help you    check me on these jump coordinates  sorry  jump coordinates verified  you seem a little distracted captain something i should know about  two of my friends just got arrested and charged with treason  i suggest you file that under not your problem  we have a recon mission to perform i need your head in the game  right  pegasus blue team jump coordinates set and verified  ready to ftl we will jump in 10 minutes on my mark mark  cally any word on the chief

alert fighters  we have work to do sir  woman on wireless pegasus galactica please secure channel  cmdr adama would like to speak to adm cain  go ahead sir  you told me theyd get a fair trial  what kind of a trial could they have possibly had  cain i assure you i heard them out  i weighed their statements against those of the guards  and i took into consideration their service records and commendations  it was a difficult decision commander but i dare say it was a fair one  they have the right to have their case heard by a jury  i am a flag officer on detached service during a time of war  regulations give me broad authority in this matter  launch the fighters  you can quote me whatever regulation youd like  im not gonna let you execute my men  i highly suggest you reconsider that statement commander  admiral galactica is launching vipers and a raptor  commander why are you launching vipers  please arrange for chief tyrol and lt agathon  to be handed over to my marines as soon as they arrive  i dont take orders from you  call it whatever you like im getting my men  you are making such a mistake  im getting my men  action stations action stations  admiral this will spiral
