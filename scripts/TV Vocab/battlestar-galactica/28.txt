                the cylons were created by man  they evolved  they rebelled  there are many copies  and they have a plan  previously on battlestar galactica  frakk me  are you alive  its probably a cylon itself  more of an animal maybe than the human models  maybe they genetically design it to perform a task  to be a fighter   dont even try defending  for no frakking reason  knock it off knock it off  you get the hell out of here now  im so sick of her  come on come on come on  i cant do it  what the hell happened kats made the trap 100 times  what are these  stims  by the look of it shes been taking them by the handful  i was   so i taking stims its so stupid  as soon as i get back to galactica ill send a rescue party  yeah right  if i say im gonna do something i do it   count on it  my kind of woman  the resistance base camp is here  cylon airbase in the area  i respect what you trying to do here  however  we have a duty to the people we left behind  we undestand that  we have to find a way to jump back to caprica   and go get then  kara  colonial mining ship majahual  entering section twofivenine keep your eyes open kat  this is where bb and jojo bought it  come on out scar you ugly cylon son of a bitch lets party  yeah i dont think hes gonna rsvp kat  he prefers surprise parties  yeah well be surprised when i blow his ass apart  yeah thatll be the day  cassie  cassie wasnt that her name  whose name  reillys girlfriend  you know what kat i told you i have no frakkin idea  so give it rest all right   reillys dead for one very simple reason  he couldnt control his fear  yup poor idiot cut and ran  gave the toaster a free shot up his ass  scar spooked him  he saw that motherfrakkers red eye coming straight for him  and he panicked  reilly was a good stick  a little short on guts but a good stick  beano who had plenty  took cally an hour to clean out his cockpit  hey does anybody remember the name of reillys girlfriend  no  karen i think  died on picon karen  no was it kather kathy  you guys what does it matter  gonna hold a little prayer circle good cry the whole thing  actually it does matter  hi  hey this is ensign baxton  ensign clark  and i guess were your new bunkmates  welcome  we just finished uh viper training on pegasus  ready to kick some cylon butt  so was beano  whos uh beano  right here  ooh scars gonna smoke you like a fine cigar my man  whos scar  not who what  toasters top gun deadliest raider in the cylon fleet  gimme break come on theyre machines  ones the same as the next  yeah thats what we thought till cap thrace cut the brain out of one  scars the best they got  lotta pilots die going after that bastard  why do they call him scar  youll find out soon enough  hes got a taste for nuggets easy pickings  starbuck i think i got something  big spud lower rim you see that  negative  a time youd have noticed it before me  fine youre the shooter  try to keep up  yeah just dont screw up   so  how does scar take out an experienced pilot like beano   he hides  he hides behind an asteroid  or the debris field that youve ignored  because it looked like a bunch of harmless rocks  you see scar doesnt like to fight  until the odds are on his side  and then suddenly out of nowhere bam  he pops out blows you to pieces  and then jumps away before you can return fire  well if you ask me i think scars a coward  this isnt dueling pistols at dawn this is war  you never wanna fight fair  you wanna sneak up behind your enemy  and club em over the head  you see scar understands that  and so do i  so thats why im gonna kill him  you  starbuck you can barely walk  look whos talking stim junkie  you know  i wouldnt be calling anyone a junkie if i were you starbuck  not the way you been pounding back that booze lately  one tigh on the ships enough  uh i got  i got 200 here  says i nail scars chromeplated ass and when i do  you hand that top gun over to me and pour me my first drink  your lipsll never touch the rim little girl  well see  starbuck  maybe you should slow down  maybe  maybe not  starbuck starbuck starbuck starbuck  comin in hot  checkers green speed 250  oh yeah its gotta be scar  found your hiding place you little frakker  starbuck kiss your 200 goodbye   in search of a home  called earth  this guys mine  somethings definitely wrong  that cant be scar  he should be jumping or wheeling to gun at us  ill check our tails  frakk  frakk im hit  scar got me im hit im hit im hit  see beano opened fire too early  you guys  you gotta fill the windscreen with the sucker  or youre not gonna hit him  see look  hes still not close enough  beanos already dead he just doesnt know it yet  do any of you guys see where he went wrong  there you see that glint  there  thats a raider  if beano hadnt fixated on his target hed have seen that  was it scar  there he is boys and girls  theres the motherfrakker im gonna kill  im afraid this is one of those  good news bad news conversations  bad news first  the mining chips broken another drill bit  we need to extend again another eight days  eight more days son of a bitch  theyve just discovered an incredibly rich vein of ore  enough to build two entire squadrons of vipers  i cant walk away from that  whats the good news  the pegasus production team has just turned out  its first combatready viper  we are beginning to replace our losses  hmm are they going to be able to replace pilots as well  lets review the tactical situation  four weeks ago  our mining ships struck pay dirt on this asteroid  a pile of strategic metals that we need to build new ships  since were sitting ducks until the miners finish the job  the old man has sent the fleet out of harms way  under the protection of pegasus  our job is to stay behind and protect the miners  unfortunately this star system is full of rocks and dust  dradis cannot tell the rocks from the bad guys  so our only reliable system of detection is  our eyeballs  which means we have to put those eyeballs way out there  split up cover a huge perimeter  well be patrolling the area in divisions of four  at these picket points  twos were going in sections of twos  are you planning the ops for me now too  cag wants us to spread out to control a larger area  its right here in the briefings  all right  so we do go in twos  scar and his buddies are out there  looking for easy kills  lets not give him any  this operation is vital  to the long term survival of this fleet  yes it is  and well continue to support it  theyre grinding us down viper by viper  whyd they stop coming at us en masse  is it because we destroyed the resurrection ship  starbucks working on that  this guys probably died and been reborn a dozen times  you may have faced him before  so what raiders reincarnate just like you  yeah just like me  great  what a frakkin world  a raiders much like a trained animal  with the basic consciousness and survival instinct  but with the destruction of the resurrection ship  when they die  theyre really dead  so  theyre not gonna mount mass attacks  where they could have major casualties  raiders reincarnate  makes sense doesnt it  it takes months for you to train a nugget  into an effective viper pilot  and then they get killed  and their experience their knowledge  their skill sets  theyre all lost forever  so if you could bring em back  and put em in a brand new body  wouldnt you do it  cause death then becomes a learning experience  how uhhow many pilots havewe lost  i mean have you lost  you know there are times when i look at you  and i forget what you are  all i see is  that kid  that pooched her landings day after day  the kid that was frakkin the chief  and thinking she was getting away with it  yeah i remember  you were like a big sister to  kara umbe careful of scar okay  hes filled with rage  about what  dyings a painful and traumatic experience  every time hes reborn hes filled with more bitter memories  scar hates you every bit as much as you hate him  a raider is a squirmy son of a bitch  you wont be able to keep him in your sights  for more than two seconds  so you have to deliver a killing burst  within that time or he will turn and nail you  all that yanking and banking gives you one hell of a case of vertigo  and that is what this chair simulates  all right jojo  go  time  not bad at least you hit the target  yeah but thats a lot better than i did the first time  i think i took out that clock over there  so whats the all time record  four hits on the xring  are you kidding who did that  i did  mind if i give it a shot for old times sake  be my guest  two seconds go  time   five  yes  frakk im hit im hit  scar got me im hit im hit im hit  kat starbuck where the hell are you  starbuck i lost visual on you  starbuck whats your position  primary and secondary hydraulics are bent i can deal with it  starbuck i got no visual on you where you at  forget it kat scars mine  dont be an idiot starbuck whats your position  yeah you remember me dont you  you want my ass so bad you can taste it  well keep coming  cause i guaranfrakkintee you  i will put you down this time for good   one more  come on starbuck lets go get it up there  why are you pushing so hard  kats just another hot shot kid out tomake her bones  like you were before you met anders  you ever think about him  whats the point hes dead  kara  if you didnt think he had a chance of surviving  whyd you promise to return with a rescue party  i thought i was  i dont know what i thought  captain thrace if scar jumps us out there um  keep your eyes open so he cant  okay but if i screw up and he bushwhacks me what do i do then  come on  they drilled this into you over and over and over  again at basic air combat  i know sir but scars something im not  scar is no different than any other attacker  he comes at you turn into him get closer  pull the trigger  turn into him get closer pull the trigger thank you sir  dont run or youll die  right  what are you waiting for  nothing sir  come here  come here i want to talk to you  now listen me  youre flying ducks wing today baxton right  yes call sign bb sir  okay thats one of our best pilots that we got  okay so just do what he says and youll be fine  just dont let the raiders get anywhere near the miners   okay  yeah thank you sir  okay go get em tiger  starbuck  that kid needs more than a pat on the ass  and a textbook quote about tactics okay  you wanna be his wetnurse go right ahead all right  be my guest  his jacket says hes a qualified viper jock  so i either fly him  or i ground him and then we go up short  whats it gonna be  your call kat  galactica starbuck wilco return to base  roger starbuck  bb duck  four raiders from behind the rocket left ten  coming hard looks like scar  duck bb what do we do  we dont have enough fuel to mix it up  we bug out bb  let our relief deal with em were going home  negative starbuck said to turn into any attack  weapons

throttles closed  oxygen generator and master switches off  check shutdown complete  nothing you could do captain you were too far away  nice work starbuck  what the hell happened to bb  what happened  he did exactly what you told him to do captain  him and duck had bingo fuel and a head start home  but instead the fng turned and attacked  and scar lit him up like a pinwheel  whyd he try to take scar on by himself  stupid idiot  try to run and your dead  i heard you you drilled that into the poor morons head  you know what  you and i both know that 99 of the time that is the right move  hmm not this time  you know what gets me  i know that in two weeks  i wont remember his face  i cant remember any of their faces after theyre killed  no matter how hard i try they just fade  i dont even remember their names  names  oh lets see there was there was flattop  who bought it on his thousandth landing  there was chuckles  stop it already  please not funny   all right  its not funny  it is funny  you know the president  says that were saving humanity for  a bright shiny future  on earth  that you and i are never gonna see  were not  because we go out  over and over again  until someday some metal motherfrakker  is gonna catch us on a bad day and just blow us away  bright shiny futures are overrated anyway  that is why  we gotta get what we can  right now  ill drink to that  to right now  so why dont we  why dont we what  wait a minute   what  wait a minute  ow hey slow down  whoa this isnt a race  kara whats going on  whats going on  whats wrong with you all right  okay you know what i dont wanna know i dont wanna know  hey what about us  there is no us all right  i just wanted a good lay  there is nothing here  do you get that nothing  sure  my gods  hey  well thats just great  frakk or fight huh  okay  maybe i am just a quick lay but kara im also your friend  i am hung up on a dead guy okay  and it is pissing me off  and i dont know what im doing  anders right on

cant download bitch  hows it feel you bastard  one of us is gonna have to break away first  and it isnt gonna be me  starbuck wake up  hes a machine hes not gonna break  youre committing suicide starbuck   in two on two engagements  cylon raiders like to isolate individual vipers  and then gang up on one  hoping to kill it before his wingman has a chance to protect him  captain  which is exactly what happened to jojo 20 minutes ago  frakk me  was it scar  bastard smoked jojo and jumped away in less than 15 s  before his wingman could get a shot off  and where were you  what  flight schedule had you flying lead for jojo on that patrol  so  whyd you assign snake to take your place  was it too early in the morning for you starbuck  what exactly are you trying to say lieutenant  what im trying to say captain  is maybe if you werent up all night drinking  jojo would have still been here  give us the room  what is it with you katraine  ever since i got back  youve been on my ass like a bad rash  you know coming late for a briefing cause your hung over  thats bad enough but when you back out on a mission  i put snake in my place because i was in no condition to fly  and i knew that  you see unlike you i dont take a bunch of pills  and then climb into my cockpit so wired  that i cant land the frakkin ship  starbuck  youre an embarrassment  you used to be the hottest stick on the fleet  now  youre just a reckless drunk  that sends other people out to get killed  whatre you gonna do hmm  what are you gonna do you gonna hit me starbuck  its scares you does it  actually no  youre afraid most of the time kat  youre afraid that youre gonna end up  like that picture of reillys girlfriend  some little  forgotten  picture that nobody really remembers  you see thats why youre riding my ass so hard  so no one will notice that scar  scares the living crap out of you  tenhut  whats going on  little tactical discussion sir  well it must have been lively  right im pairing you two up  kat i want you to fly starbucks wing out by the big spud  sir i  i got a hunch a couple of raiders  are gonna try and sneak through that sector  so i want my heavy hitters out there to greet em  skids up in 49 minutes  sir  starbuck  are you okay  colonial mining ship majahual  entering section twofivenine keep your eyes open kat  this is where bb and jojo bought it  cassie

inbound about 15 out  all right scar lets see how much you like playing chicken  when you cant download you bitch  hows it feel you bastard  one of us is gonna have to break away first  and it isnt gonna be me  starbuck im inbound your starboard seven high at ten  starbuck wake up  hes a machine hes not gonna break  hes a machine hes not gonna break  i got nothing to lose  youre committing suicide starbuck  im coming back  i said it  i meant it  yeah okay  gods damn it  i am gonna put him right in front of you  do not miss him you frakkin stim junkie  and thats the way its done  yeah lets go home skipper whoo  yo starbuck  hey starbuck  my cup runneth dry  seems i recall someone boasting  that my lips would never touch this rim  you earned it  to bb  jojo  reilly  beano  dipper  flattop  chuckles  jolly  crashdown  sheppard  dash  flyboy  stepchild  puppet  fireball  to all of em  so say we all  i could have done it you know  could have taken out scar  head on pass  straight for him  just needed to get a little closer  so why didnt you do it  probably would have died in the process  the bastard was too good  couple months ago  i wouldnt have even thought about that  would have just gone for the glory  hoping i could pull it out of the fire somehow  quit kicking yourself  you did the right thing and called in your wingman  okay  scars dead you and kat came back alive  its not why i did it though  cant get anders out of my head  cant get over this insane hope that maybe hes alive  you got something to live for now  not just die for  hes down for the count uh
