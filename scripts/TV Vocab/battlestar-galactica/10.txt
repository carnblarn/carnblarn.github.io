                narrator previously on battlestar galactica    cottle your doctor back on caprica was right  its too damn late to operate the cancer is too far advanced  have you ever heard of chamalla extract  it means that youre still acting like youre everyones best friend  were not friends youre the cag  the chief wanted me to kick your ass out of bed  but clearly you still need the rest take your time no rush  i need new pilots and i want you to train them  i can do that  they slipped through hows that possible  no 6 she thinks she loves him now that she cant live without him   bothers you doesnt it  well get them in the end  i can assure you that fuel shortage is our number one priority  galactica has ships scouring the nearby star systems  and we can anticipate that they will soon find tylium  hamilton  madam president tylium ore is extremely rare  if we dont find any how long before the fleet runs out of fuel  that all depends on how well we conserve  isnt it a fact maam president that we only have enough for two more jumps  yes that is correct  do we have a contingency plan if we run out of tylium      we would  if that were to happen  we would use our last fuel  to jump to the nearest planetary system  and pray were lucky enough to find a habitable planet  madam president without fuel to take even the most basic evasive manoeuvres  no  reporter 1wouldnt we be like ducks in a cylon shooting gallery  yes we would    roslin im  im sorry  that is all for now      reporter 2 she did not do this  crashdown  commencing sweep 87 of asteroid field  boomer any luck   how many times are you gonna ask me that boomer  well until you find some tylium ore  dont you want to be a hero to ensign davis    you havent noticed how she always sits next to you in the mess   hows it going crash you look so cute  damn it theres so much debris in this system the dradis is useless  this is going to take 100 years  boomer i heard about how you found water how you saved the whole place      jackpot boomer that asteroid dead ahead is a mountain of tylium    crashdown check it  thank the gods were heroes yeah  were heroes it never fails  great the second that i score the bus driver jumps in and takes the credit   okay so whos the one that we suggest  what  cylons    the rocks crawling with them  we are well and truly fracked  only tylium within 12 light years and weve got to kiss it goodbye  yeah along with our asses if we dont get out of here fast      tigh it figures the cylons would be sitting on the only source of fuel within our reach  still staking out every waterhole in the desert  only this time its a lake enough tylium to last us a couple of years  apollo this must be some kind of conveyor belt  to get the ore from the mine here into this cracking plant here  gaeta a refinery this far from their home world  apollo why not they need fuel as much as we do  gaeta now theyve got it  and enough firepower to keep it  apollo all right so we forget this asteroid find another source  you can bet your ass the cylons will be guarding that one too  we send the raptors out farther find a source they havent reached yet  tigh well use up all our fuel doing it howre we going to get our refinery ship  we take the tylium from the cylons    with all respect this is hardly a time to attack a superior force  this is exactly the time  we know where they are they dont know where we are  well catch them with their pants down  if we fail  end of game  so we dont fail  starbuck when the missile gets close enough  youll be pulling maybe 7 gs  but to catch you the bastards gonna have to pile on 40 to 60  its guidance system cant hack it and itll miss  most of the time  exactly how often is most of the time  it depends on your judgment and how well you pray  attention on deck  adama as you were  lt thrace can i have a word  starbuck of course take five guys  starbuck whats up adama how are they doing  wobbly as newborn colts but theyre getting stronger  thats good  got a job for you  rumour mill has it that youre planning an op  rumour mills right for a change  capt adama and col tigh are working up the plan now  and i need some serious outofthebox thinking  outofthebox is where i live  ive been taking chamalla for a medical condition  so what have you seen  it started out as dreams of the cylon that we had executed  but i had the dreams before we captured him   the images were  prescient  roslin uncanny  and now im seeing things while im awake   what kind of things  snakes  there were snakes crawling all over my podium during a press conference   how many  about a dozen    youre kidding right  you read pythia and now youre having me on  no   who is pythia  one of the oracles in the sacred scrolls   pythia wrote about the exile and the rebirth of the human race  and the lords anointed a leader  to guide the caravan of the heavens to their new homeland  and unto the leader they gave a vision  of serpents numbering two and ten  as a sign of things to come  pythia wrote that  she also wrote that the new leader suffered a wasting disease  and would not live to enter the new land  but youre not dying are you  apollo and that will allow the attack force to wipe out these installations here  now if we do it right there wont be any cylon survivors  apollo and the asteroid will be ours  adama what do you think starbuck  its a textbook perfect plan which is why it wont work  tigh of course we bow to your vast experience in strategic planning  refresh my memory what year was it that you graduated from war college  whats the matter married life not all you expected  enough both of you  were not going to win this one by the book  i want starbuck in here  because shes not weighed down by conventional thinking  all due respect gentlemen were not as crazy as she is  okay so what would you do differently  to start  jumping galactica in behind the planetoid  to hide it from the cylon base is an obvious move  you think theyll be covering that blind spot with recon patrols  i would if i were them  what we need to do is make their patrols part of our plan you know  make their tactics work for us  heres what i would do    at position code deacon  well need three civilian freighter ships to use as decoys  which means those passengers will have to be relocated to other ships  which are already overcrowded  yes if you approve  starbuck the decoy ships will jump into the enemy star system  at extreme radar range from the cylon asteroid  galactica will jump here  close enough to launch its vipers at the base  soon as the decoy freighters arrive in the system theyll break wireless silence  theyll be posing as a mining fleet coming after the tylium  and pretend to be unaware of the cylon presence  starbuck the cylons will hear the messages  and send a force of raiders after them  this will leave the base relatively undefended  well have raptors prepositioned to keep an eye on the cylons  starbuck when the cylons move toward the decoys  galacticas vipers will come in from behind and obliterate the base  apollo without the base theyll be unable to rearm refuel  well mop them up and then well take the tylium  what happens to the crews on the civilian decoy ships  theyll keep their ftl drives spooled up and jump clear the first sign of trouble  how many casualties do you anticipate  ltll cost us    if you succeed whats to prevent the cylons from coming back with reinforcements  adama nothing  adama but if we get a chance to knock out that base  it will buy us some time  roslin why  if you keep running from the schoolyard bully  he keeps on chasing you but when you turn around and stop  and you punch him really hard in a sensitive spot  hell think twice about coming back again  so its either this or run out of fuel and be annihilated  sometimes you have to roll the hard six  well the freighters are yours good hunting everyone  adama operation starts in 48 hours  tigh this is our target  baltar a cylon base  and youre the cylon expert  tigh we need to destroy their military facilities  without harming the tylium ore under the surface  tigh exactly  a nuke would destroy the cylons  but the radiation would render the ore inert unusable  i see your dilemma  well youre in luck you know  baltar refined tylium contains tremendous enthalpy  to the order of half a billion mega joules per kilo  subjected to right heat and compression say from a conventional warhead  you should get a suitably devastating explosion  without the radioactive fallout  all we have to do is hit the right spot  specifically you must hit the staging tanks for the refined tylium precursor  its a lot more unstable than the fuel itself  and where would they be    i need your advice on this one  im flattered gaius  but i dont know the first thing about tylium refineries  neither do i  oh come on you must have an inkling   where i should tell them to bomb  no  no 6 but god does baltar oh good  i suppose god doesnt want me to destroy the base  because hes the cylon god right  god doesnt take sides  he only wants your love  no 6 open your heart to him and hell show you the way  itd be a lot simpler if he came out and told me  you must remember to surrender your ego remain humble  baltar if you ask me  god could do with cleaning his ears out then hed hear what i have to say   relax your neck  why what are you going to do  no 6 i said relax baltar all right but please dont  starbuck where would the staging tanks be doctor    there right there  baltar hit any one of them and the place will go up like a three kiloton bomb    well done  forceful so decisive delivered with such lan  he didnt speak to me  god didnt speak to me  i was totally lying  i just picked that spot at random  he doesnt always speak in words gaius  so the fate  of the entire human race depends upon my wild guess  trainer attention on deck adama as you were  hows the knee starbuck  ltll be ready im not missing this party    apollos leading the strike force youll have to sit this one out   im the best pilot that you have  not right now  in combat you got to pull 6 7 gs  doc says your knee wont take it   well then hes wrong  is he  a viper thruster pedal  requires this much force  to activate    now youre on your attack run  they launch their missiles  so youve got to jam that pedal  into the firewall  and hold a 6 g turn  for 10 seconds or you die    adama 10 9 8     this is only 3 gs starbuck not 6  im sorry its a tough one  but youre staying home  starbuck keep your ingress low and fast  use the terrain to stay hidden till the last second  make sure you give the flak suppression unit enough time  so they can weaken defences  apollo you dont think im up to this starbuck of course i do  youll be fine  look youre worried that im not gonna pull it out of the fire  with some highrisk retinadetaching move  the way starbuck would  look kara im sorry youre not suiting up  cause everyone would feel so much better me included  if you were riding along with us  but this isnt an ego trip this is my job  and dont think for one moment that i will not get it done  i hope so because weve got one shot  dont frack it up by overthinking    helo nice thing about being on the run after a nuclear war  nobody left to complain if we hide out in their barn or raid their pantry  while youre on your way to steal a ship and get off the planet   its odd isnt it  what  that we havent seen a single living human being  since the one you shot when you rescued me  were still alive why nobody else  boomer probably holed up in the fallout shelters or something  two ways out and a lovely view what could be better  a feather bed with a silk comforter  helo you hungry  boomer i dont know what do we got helo peanut butter  baked beans corn  how about some chilli    a simple no would do  sharon have you been taking your antiradiation meds  i think it was those cold beans we had this afternoon   you okay now  yeah  how far you figure to delphi  eight maybe ten days if we move fast  if we start early we can be there in no time    cant sleep  i couldnt either before a big op  the mark ii  good ship  adama got me out of a lot of tough scrapes  adama ive got something for you  it belonged to your grandfather  adama my mum bought it for him when he was in law school    you see the engraving on it  yeah i can barely make it out but  he was a better father than i was  dad used to carry that into court cases  claimed he never lost unless he left it behind  so youre worried too  about what  you know sometimes it feels like the whole ship  thinks starbuck would do better  i dont  how can you be so sure  because youre my son    adama get some rest  youre going to need it  dad  ill bring it back  youd better or ill kick your ass its a good lighter      sharon wake up  helo what the frack you killed her boomer let me see    we gotta go right now  wait a minute i saw her on my lap i saw her blood spill on my lap  lets move mister     what the hell is going on  i dont know well figure it out later  jump complete sir dradis reports nothing but hash  just as we expected cant see a thing  we are now within launch range of the cylon base  officer 1   constellation jump complete on station point deacon  initiate search pattern delta  officer 2  ore flight bravo delta wilco  officer 3 ore flight nebula delta initiated  the balls in play  you can bet they heard that  now theyll try to locate the decoys  and when they do  if they take the bait all hell breaks loose   until then  we wait  boomer galactica boomer  tally 90 plus headed deacon   speed 250    apollo  the cylons have seen the freighter theyre en route to intercept it  they took the bait   mr gaeta launch strike force 1  aye sir  d launch strike force one  attention pilots man your planes   pilots man your planes       how hard did they bite  boomers report said 90 plus  theyve launched most of their fighter force    launch officer give them hell sir firing    attack forces away  i just hope that lee can  lee isnt the problem  you should take a good look at yourself  i had to go through the same transition  when youre in the cockpit youre in control  its hard to give it up  it would just be a lot easier if i was flying with them  all you can do now is wait and hope you didnt make any mistakes  i never wanted this kind of responsibility  the cylons never asked us what we wanted  welcome to the big leagues    crashdown  galactica crashdown  tally 50 plus on an intercept course  repeat 50 plus inbound  whats that mean  it means that a cylon patrol spotted our attack force  the base sent out 50 more raiders to intercept  fifty raiders  that means were outnumbered now 5to1  werent the decoys supposed to take care of that   the cylons were too smart for that  frack  estimated time to strike intercept 2 minutes    fireball fireball  multiple bandits left 10 high range 40  weapons free committing    hot dog visual tally press  hot dog break right      fireball your six    im hit man eject  fireball  stop  buzzer deadbolt spinner two bandits closing your right side  spinner no joy        hot dog  galactica hot dog heavily engaged mission outcome doubtful   this sounds fracking awful  theyre getting cut to pieces out there  buzzer get out of there move  buzzer  deadbolt right vertical now  deadbolt diamond get a shot get him off me  mr gaeta abort strike 1  dualla strike one galactica return to base  repeat abort your mission and return to base    stubb  galactica stubb  cylon strike force is turning away from deacon and inbound to galactica  operator noting raiders inbound  the cylons heard our transmission recall didnt they  does that mean the first wave of raiders  is ignoring the decoys and is coming after us  thats exactly what it means    baltar so when are we going to launch the reserve vipers to defend galactica  there are no reserve vipers everything is on the board already  now we play for all the marbles  starbuck its your plan  mr gaeta  will you please tell d to get on the scrambler and inform apollo the back door is open  aye lieutenant  gaeta d please send a scrambler to capt apollo  message reads the back door is open  apollo galactica back door is open  godspeed apollo        lt thrace why didnt you tell me  we had another attack force hidden in the freighters  starbuck we adama it was my decision  i routinely restrict tactical details to those who need to know  old habits die hard  so you still might pull this off  adama if dr baltars target information is correct  and whether we get blown to pieces by those cylon raiders  heading toward us right now  speaking of which im needed in cic      initial point in 5 seconds  flak suppression unit cleared hot  apollo  okay lets do this  come on lee its all on you    incoming    apollo  weapons free by the numbers people  target acquired tone and lock  kat  firing  tone and lock firing  whats got into these fracking missiles  come on  theyre jamming the guidance systems  apollo strike two apollo  then we get close enough so we dont need the guidance systems  apollo well have to blow this thing manually  wilco apollo rolling in    chuckles    oh frack  chuckles bought it hes going down    kat  now theyve got our attack axis zeroed in  theres no way to fracking get close  theres gotta be  apollo weve got to get out of this flak  lets get down below deck down where the target is  ive got an idea im gonna take a closer look    commander on deck  adama as you were  the first wave of cylons will be on us in three minutes  notify the strike 1 vipers  that they can stop running and blast those bastards to hell  dualla yes sir  pilot 1 attacking cylon fighters pilot 2 target acquired tone and lock    oh no dont do this lee  the conveyor tunnels clear im going through it  youre out of your fracking mind apollo  whats going on  gaeta captain apollos flying into the conveyor tunnel  hoping it will lead him to the refinery  baltar has he gone raving mad  theres no way to ensure it does anything of the kind    come on keep it together lee  oh lords      apollo okay im through the tunnel they cant get a firing solution on me    apollo there you are   okay ive got you ive got you      galactica apollo  apollo  mission accomplished  yes        you can tell dr baltar he was right on the money  its one hell of a fireworks show  and theres plenty more for us back in the canyon  once this place is history    gaeta congratulations doctor it worked  it did    it worked  im sorry madam president im sorry  no need to apologise  thanks to you we have enough fuel to last us a few years    dualla commander strike 1 reports inbound cylons are bugging out  request permission to go after them sir   tell our people to pursue and destroy them  affirmative  strike 1 tear them up      starbuck apollo you magnificent bastard  that was one hell of a piece of flying and i couldnt have done it better myself  apollo im sorry i didnt hear you  i said that i couldnt have done it better myself  well thank you  i had my doubts  so did i  i wasnt sure that crazy ass plan of yours would even possibly work  starbuck you deserve this  davis crash        no 6 have you read the pythian prophecy gaius  not since the 6th grade  baltar i cant say ancient history is my favourite subject  no 6 you should have paid closer attention  baltar to what  all of this has happened before all of this will happen again  everyone knows that verse what are you getting at    remember this one  led by serpents numbering two and ten  the vipers theyre the serpents  theres a later verse gaius you should read it  though the outcome favoured the few  it led to a confrontation at the home of the gods    are you telling me that god guided my finger to that target for some  arcane scriptural purpose  you are part of gods plan gaius  so god wanted me to destroy the cylon base  you did well you gave yourself over to him  yes i suppose i did  theres really no other logical explanation for it   i was  am    i am an instrument of god
