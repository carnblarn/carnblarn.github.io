                previously on  battlestar galactica  i have a message for you  the fruit born of two peoples  is alive  a child named after  the wife and sister of the allknowing zeus  hera lives  its not true  i dont suppose you will tell me what this is all about  i mean whats so important about this kid  she may very well be the shape of things to come  the cylons knew exactly where we were gonna be   that doesnt mean ellen  this is the map  the map that i drew for you i gave this to you in your tent  you were gonna burn it but your wife offered to do it  but she didnt did she  i  i want to explain he said hed kill you   who said  one of the brother cavils  this is kacey  kacey  this is kara  your mother  our people are gonna attack the air base  detention center power station and other critical facilities  the plan is to sow as much chaos and confusion as possible  the moment galactica and pegasus arrive  no pegasus just galactica  these are your orders take the civilian fleet  and wait for me for 18 hours if im not back in 18 hours  then find earth  you know the mission  you should also know theres only one way that this mission ends  and thats with the successful rescue of our people  off of new caprica  good hunting  hoshis working on updating our map coordinates for the search for earth  civilian captains want to meet with you they have questions   problems  talk to me lee  im having trouble    accepting this  i know  but we have to push forward  keep the fleet together  find earth  right thats our duty  theres still a chance theyll come back  your father has pulled off more than a few miracles in his day  i know that  and i havent given up hope  yes you have  i saw the look on your face when you came back from galactica  like you were never gonna see him again  am i that easy to read  just to me  hes taking on too much  for one halfstrength battlestar to handle  and thats not opinion thats military fact  hes not coming back from this none of them are  all we can do is make plans for the future  we have to survive  we have to find earth  if we dont theyll be no one to remember a man named william adama  or a battlestar named galactica  that is our charge to keep  to keep humanity going  no matter what the cost no matter   no matter who we leave behind  you can do this  you can get us there  you are commander of this fleet  and you will guide us to safety  and you will do it no matter the cost  because youre an adama  did i ever tell you how proud i am to serve with you  not in so many words no  well i am proud to serve with you lieutenant  and to call you my wife  now lets talk about  map coordinates  meeting with ships captains  i lost three men today  and if that sergeant wasnt on her game theyd have killed us all  i know godsdamn it you dont have to keep running your mouth about it   i get it all right  you get this  if sharon had been killed not only would we not get the launch keys  but the cylons would know that we were in direct contact with galactica  now this whole plan the fate of this whole city  would have fallen apart do you understand that colonel  i get it  good  you know what has to be done here  if you dont want to do it i understand  but believe me colonel someone is gonna do this  now it would be better for her sake if it was you   i had to do it saul  i had to  it was all for you  and i want you to know  that i would have done anything to save you  i know i know its all right   everythings gonna be all right  no you dont understand  i got you out of detention saul  it was me  i got you out  i went to see them  the cylons  finally got to the one in charge  and i got him to notice me  the way men notice me  i slept with him  and i felt like puking every time he put his filthy hands on me  but i smiled  and i faked it  to save you saul  but you listen to me  id do it again  frak anybody do anything  even gave em the map  i didnt want anybody   to be killed  i could use a drink  youve always been there for me when i needed you  im exhausted  i feel like i could just curl up here  should have listened to you saul  should have stayed on galactica  dont worry about any of that now  you just    you just go to sleep  im sleepy  i love you  do you hear me  i mean i told you and i told you  but to what end  too secure in your smug superiority to listen  too comfortable  in your predictions of success to  even consider the possibility of defeat  and where are we now  and more to the point  wheres laura roslin  wheres tom zarek  at large  whereabouts unknown free at any rate  probably with colonel tigh  solidifying the insurgencys hold over the publics imagination  what would you have us do gaius  leave  pack up your centurions  and go  please go  and then what  what would you do if we really just left you here  youd live out your lives  in peace and never trouble yourselves with thoughts of us again  or would you raise your children with stories of the cylon  the mechanical slaves who once did your bidding only to turn against you  killers who committed genocide against your race  and occupiers of this city until we just ran away  would you tell them to tell the story to their children  and to their childrens children  and nurse a dream of vengeance down through the years  so that one day they could just go out  into the stars and hunt the cylon once more  blood for blood  it has to stop one day  oh my gods  nice job anders  come on come on  come on okay thats our cue  you know what to do  rally your people and get them to the evac points  okay
