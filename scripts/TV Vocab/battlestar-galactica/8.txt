                narrator previously on battlestar galactica    adama doral  when this body dies my consciousness will be transferred to another one  the cylons have the ability to mimic human form they look like us now  this man has been identified as a cylon agent   you sleep i watch  no youre the one who needs sleep  you were lucky that you didnt lapse into a coma  the time is going to come when you wont be able to hide what youre going through              laura        roslin yes  madam president are you okay in there  im fine its just the side effects from the chamalla  roslin you know that thing they say whats worse the cancer or the cure  what do you need  you have an urgent call from the captain of the gemenon traveller  roslin can i call him back billy he says he found a cylon on board    roslin they found him in the starboard storage compartment  roslin looked like hed been camped here for days  adama are they sure its a cylon  roslin the captain identified him by one of the photos we sent out  hes another copy of the man you knew as leoben conroy  where is it now  aboard the gemenon traveller locked in a storeroom under guard  isolate that ship  order the cap to fly escort around the gemenon traveller  and not to approach any other ship in the fleet  aye sir  kat galactica fly close  ill send a team over to destroy it immediately  roslin i want this man interrogated first adama first of all  its not a him its an it  second anything it says cannot be trusted  best thing to do is destroy it immediately  id like to hear what this thing has to say it might be important  madam president ive dealt with this model before  adama ltll fill your head with doubletalk halfbaked philosophy and confuse you  then send someone who wont be easily confused  thats an order commander  roslin i want him interrogated  order understood  starbuck think itll give me something adama no  adama president disagrees  you need me to go ill shower up and go  hows this coming  we got the entire avionics package figured out  fire control navigation  and i think that i am zeroing in on her ftl drive  i did this in a hurry about three weeks ago  its my afteraction report on leoben  its a very clever machine manipulative cunning  the only problem with leoben isnt that he lies  that would be too easy  its that he mixes lies with truth  just remember hes gonna try to get into your head  my mum always said there was nothing in there anyway     just be careful  he has an agenda its a goal you wont understand until later  your job is to make sure he doesnt achieve the goal  yes sir          tyrol lieutenant   whats up  nothing  just wanted to see if what i told you the other day helped at all  yeah actually it did  you do treat this thing more like an animal than a machine  and it actually works  tyrol where did you come up with that anyway just pop into your head   im a cylon  you know thats not even funny  if i could prove that i wasnt  would that make a difference you know between us    pilot gemenon traveller raptor sevenoneniner  inbound with lt thrace aboard  permission to dock  man roger sevenoneniner permission granted  captain really does look like a person starbuck yeah  captain must be all full of wires inside  starbuck no you cut him open theres blood guts the whole thing  its sweating  well ill be look at that  god they go through a lot of trouble to imitate people  captain why do you think they do that starbuck i dont care why  starbuck but the fact that these things sweat  now thats interesting      starbuck sleeping  praying  i dont think the gods answer the prayers of toasters  god answers everyones prayers   how many cylons are there in the fleet  we havent been properly introduced  im leoben  starbuck how many cylons in the fleet leoben i have no idea    whats your name  how long have you been hiding aboard this ship  am i not allowed to know your name  starbuck why were you hiding here leoben i had a mission to perform  listen its a small thing can you just tell me who you are  tell me about your mission and ill think about it   my mission was to conduct sabotage  what kind of sabotage  god you stink  can i get some air in here between you and the humidity  starbuck i am not here to play games with you  you said you wanted to cooperate either start talking or we are done  okay  but  i really wanna know your name  starbuck open  are you lt starbuck      yes you are  i knew    leoben i was right  i was right i saw it ive seen it   happy now  it all makes sense now  doesnt it  leoben now we can talk now we can talk about a lot of things  like what  i planted a nuclear warhead aboard one of your ships  its set to go off at 1830 hours    where  im not ready to give that up yet  youre lying theres no warhead  you cant take the chance starbuck  your military training dictates you take it to your masters and let them decide  maybe my training wasnt so good  maybe i push you out the air lock and tell them you never said a word  now whos lying  these things happen for a reason dont they  im looking forward to spending more time with you  we have a lot to talk about  its gonna be fun  put the red  on alert immediately dee  and sweep galactica for any kind of radiological devices  right  contact all the captains in the fleet  adama have them do radiological sweeps of their ships  adama but emphasize that this is just a precaution  adama i dont wanna alarm anyone until were sure  yes sir  well well know for sure in 8 hours and 40 minutes  lt thrace did he say anything else  no  he guessed my call sign  seemed really happy when he found out who i was  adama hes playing with your mind  hes been stowed away for weeks aboard the fleet  fifty ways he couldve heard the word starbuck on a wireless set  thats what i figured sir  roslin any idea what he wants  not yet  says hes looking forward to spending some time with me though  dont take any chances starbuck  yes sir  you believe in the gods dont you lords of kobol and all that  starbuck why should i tell you  its not a trick question i wanted to see how much i got right  so you pray to artemis aphrodite  starbuck wheres the warhead  i was right  see our faiths are similar but i look to one god not to many  i dont give a damn about what you believe  to know the face of god is to know madness    i see the universe  i see the patterns  leoben i see the foreshadowing that precedes every moment of every day  its all there i see it and you dont  and i have a surprise for you  i have something to tell you about the future  starbuck is that so leoben it is  but we have to see this thing through till the end      what is the most basic article of faith  leoben this is not all that we are    the difference between you and me is i know what that means and you dont  i know that im more than this body this consciousness  a part of me swims in the stream  but in truth im standing on the shore the current never takes me downstream  this is worse than galactica and i didnt think that was possible  and what was that swimming in streams or something  do you mind  leoben thank you    starving havent eaten in days  kind of bad programming isnt it i mean why bother with hunger   part of being human  youre not human  hows your lunch  you know how it is  when youre starving anything tastes good        did that hurt  yeah that hurt  starbuck machines shouldnt feel pain  shouldnt bleed  shouldnt sweat  sweat thats funny thats good  see a smart cylon would turn off the old pain software about now  but i dont think youre so smart  maybe ill turn it off and you wont even know  starbuck heres your dilemma  turn off the pain you feel better but that makes you a machine not a person  you see human beings cant turn off their pain  human beings have to suffer  and cry and scream and endure  because they have no choice  so the only way you can avoid the pain youre about to receive  is by telling me exactly what i wanna know  just like a human would  i knew this about you  youre everything i thought you would be  but it wont work i wont tell you anything  maybe not  but then youll know deep down that i beat you  that a human being beat you  and that you are truly no greater than we are  youre just a bunch of machines after all  let the games begin  hi      well look what the cat dragged in  baltar lt valerii  its an unexpected visit  baltar you look wonderful    boomer i need your help baltar anything i can do  anything at all  wonder why they call her boomer  i heard you were working on a test  to tell the difference between cylons and humans  bingo  i cant really talk about that at the moment  you wouldnt help settle a bet for me would you  baltar why do they call you boomer  if youre working on a cylon detector do you think i could be in the first batch  you know to be tested   whats her rush  whats your rush  baltar im not sure it would be appropriate to show favouritism  if indeed i am working on anything at all  i saved your life back on caprica  my copilot gave up his seat for you i brought you back to galactica to safety  you wouldnt even be here if it wasnt for me you owe me  she shoots she scores  baltar i suppose theres some small truth to that  so can you test me or not  i think you should do it  results will be quite intriguing  baltar the technology for cylon detection  is not quite ready for fullscale implementation  but i could use a beta test subject  sharons late  half an hour  i notice youre calling her sharon now  yeah i choose to think of her as one of them  because you dislike her  because in the scheme of things we are as we do  she acts like one of them thinks like them  she is one of them  but shes one of us it would be best to remember that   we had sex  congratulations  no 6 does he love you boomer i think so  no 6 has he said it boomer not directly  then youre just guessing  stay in your current location  were setting up a cabin for you nearby  food water electricity all the comforts  shouldnt be too hard to convince him to stay and start a life together  no 6 if not kill him  can you handle that    we made it this far well make it all the way  something happened to you i wouldnt know how to deal with it  caprica    doral if he flees he dies  no 6 does he love you  helo  helo hey whats going on boomer come on we gotta go now  i saw cylons theyre heading this way  we got to travel fast even faster than before   why whats different  everything just trust me  i do      now if you were human  youd be just about ready to start offering up some false information  about the location of the nuke  starbuck some tiny thing that may get you a reward and spare you some of this  but then i keep forgetting youre not human  starbuck youre a machine  i am more  than you could ever imagine    i am god  im sorry youre god    wow nice to meet you  thats good well give you a couple of minutes with that  its funny isnt it  were all god starbuck all of us  i see the love that binds all living things together  love  you dont even know what the word means  i know that god loved you more than all other living creatures  and you repaid his divine love with sin  with hate corruption evil  so then he decided to create the cylons  the gods had nothing to do with it we created you us  it was a stupid fracked up decision and we have paid for it  you slaughtered my entire civilisation  that is sin that is evil and you are evil    am i  leoben i see the truths that float past you in the stream  starbuck you have a real thing about rivers and streams dont you  i think we should indulge you in your obsession  do you realise i could kill you before they came back in the room  i could get to my feet  rip your skull from your spinal column  crash through that door  kill the guard in less time than it has taken me to describe it to you  then why dont you  its not the time    guard hes loose    i have a surprise for you  you fracked up pal  now the gloves come off    combat col tigh  adama hows the search going for the nuke  nothing so far  adama how much time remaining tigh 2 hours 9 minutes  spread out the fleet  no ship more than 500 clicks from any other ship   lf theres a nuke lets limit the damage  aye sir  no  do it      starbuck leave him  guard sir    tell me where the warhead is  otherwise youre gonna drown in that bucket  i cant drown i cant die  starbuck right  commander adama mentioned that how if your body dies  your consciousness is downloaded or transferred into another body  something like that  no exactly like that  see ive been thinking  why is a cylon willing to talk at all  why does he care if we destroy his body  wont he just transfer away and laugh at all of us and our stupid human ideas    starbuck tell me where the warhead is  this is not your path starbuck you have a different destiny  dont interrupt me  you see im gonna dazzle you with my poor human brain  you see i think that youre afraid  youre afraid that were a long way from home  what if you dont transfer all the way back  what if when you die here you really die  starbuck its your chance to find out if youre really god  or just a bunch of circuits with a bad haircut  im not afraid of dying  someones programmed you with a fairytale of god and streams and life ever after  but somewhere in that hard drive you call a brain  is a beeping message  error error does not compute  i dont have a soul i have software  if i die im gone       i have a soul  i see patterns  i know you  youre damaged  you were born to a woman  who believed suffering was good for the soul so you suffered   your life is a testament to pain  injuries accidents  some inflicted upon others others inflicted upon yourself  it surrounds you like a bubble  but its not real its just  its just something she put in your head  its something that you wanna believe because it means  youre the problem not the world that you live in  you wanna believe it because it means that youre bad luck  youre like a cancer that needs to be removed  because you hear her voice every day  and you want her to be right  start again    baltar now we just pop this in the slot and wait for the results  green youre a normal human being  red youre an evil cylon    should take a couple of minutes  so tell me are you from aerilon  theres a slight trace of an accent there  boomer what no troy baltar troy  tell me why is that familiar  mining settlement  the accident  baltar the explosion right  that was tragic  baltar your family boomer they died with the rest  im very sorry    its a lie    congratulations doctor youve just uncovered your very first cylon  now heres an interesting moment in the life of gaius baltar  what will he do   is everything okay  yeah  yeah im just interpolating the results  the question is what will she do if you expose her  thank you or kill you  i thought it was just green or red  well its a little more complicated than that  she probably doesnt know  she probably thinks shes just another girl from troy  whose entire background vanished in a mysterious accident  should be interesting to see how she responds  when you tell her the truth  im guessing her cylon side will take over and break your neck  before you can give away her secret  lets find out  congratulations its green  its very bright green   youre not a cylon  really   for a second i was worried what you were gonna say  baltar were you boomer yeah  well theres nothing to be worried about anymore   you couldnt be more human if you tried   well thanks  anytime  i have something to tell you  how long before this supposed bomb goes off  less than an hour  get me a shuttle im going to the gemenon traveller  i want to see the cylon myself  billy madam president you need to roslin dont even start  i dont wanna discuss this ive made my decision  not until i get you a security detail  enough for fracks sake let him breathe    youre really sick  youre not a person youre a machine thats enjoying its own pain  all this has happened before  and all of it will happen again  dont quote scripture  you dont have the right to use those words  you kneel before idols and ask for guidance  but you cant see that your destinys already been written  leoben each of us plays a role each time a different role  maybe the last time i was the interrogator and you were the prisoner  the players change the story remains the same  and this time  this time  your role is to deliver my soul to god  do it for me  leoben its your destiny and mine    and i told you i had a surprise for you are you ready  youre gonna find kobol  birthplace of us all kobol will lead you to earth  this is my gift to you kara    roslin what the hell is going on here  what exactly is it that you are doing here  its a machine sir   theres no limit to the tactics i can use  and wheres the warhead  starbuck i dont know roslin you dont know  roslin you spent the last eight hours torturing this man  this machine  roslin whatever it is  and you dont have a single piece of information to show for it  he thinks he can see the future  says he knows our destiny our fate  he says were gonna find kobol and that its gonna lead us to earth  clean him up theres not much time  yes sir    roslin do you know who i am leoben yes  i apologise for what youve been through  roslin take his restraints off  do it  thank you  i can do more  i can guarantee your safety i can order your release  we are running out of time  we have only four minutes left until your bomb goes off  roslin ive come here to tell you  that this conflict between our peoples does not have to continue  it can stop right here with us we have to trust each other  trust me  roslin i think you know you can  tell me what i need to know and you will live  the warhead doesnt exist i made it up  lieutenant was right i was too far out  i didnt wanna die so when i got caught i made up a story to buy some time  i see  thank you for the truth  leoben thank you madam president  dont be too hard on kara she was just doing her job  the military  they teach you to  dehumanise people  ill take that into consideration  no stand down    laura i have something to tell you   adama is a cylon  yeah     are you all right  im fine   the bomb  nothing   put him out the airlock  what   you cant do that not after he told you  yes i can and i will  lieutenant look at me  youve lost perspective  during the time i have allowed him to remain alive and captive on this ship  he has caused our entire fleet to spread out defenceless  he puts insidious ideas in our minds  more lethal than any warhead  he creates fear  but youre right hes a machine  and you dont keep a deadly machine around  when it kills your people and threatens your future  you get rid of it    hes not afraid to die  hes just afraid that his soul wont make it to god        lords of kobol hear my prayer  i dont know if he had a soul or not  but if he did take care of it  hell of a risk you took today  something i had to do  care to tell me why  president adar once said  that the interesting thing about being a president  is that you dont have to explain yourself to anyone    something wrong  no nothing at all
