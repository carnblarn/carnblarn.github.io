                previously on battlestar galactica  i was burnt out  i started taking stims   what are these  stims  and by the look of her shes been taking em by the handful  let go  you know coming in late for a briefing  cause youre hungover thats bad enough   when you back out on of a mission  you see unlike you  i dont take a bunch of pills and then climb in my cockpit  so wired that i cant land the frakkin ship  starbuck  youre an embarrassment  i need you back in the cic  just aint the same without you in there   intimidating the inmates  oh im not  there are only 12 cylon models  but in the entire occupation on new caprica i only saw seven  who are the final five  i cant talk about that  do you have any idea what its talking about  most cylons think the conscious mind of the hybrid has simply gone mad  and the vocalizations we hear are meaningless  but not everyone thinks that  you will delete the order from your logs  execute  its okay its okay  theres something beautiful  miraculous between life and death  you mean theres no food to be salvaged  what about the good food wed stored  before we started inadvertently churning out the contaminated stuff  the newly processed bad food went into the depleted storage system  everythings tainted  but sharons out finding all this algae for us to process  its tough to choke down but its almost pure protein  what if sharon comes back  and reports theres no clear passage to this planet  then the question is doc   how long can we survive  with the rations weve been on  id say seven to ten days  when is she due back  she was due three hours ago  the  radiation levels are high but shes strong and  shes a  shell be here any moment  im sorry guys i dont have anything  to share  i told you starbuck i dont have anything   get off my back  i saw a protein bar on your cot   i gave it to cottle  right   right after i gave mine  oh so what now im a liar  all right all right can it  kat get down here  for fraks sake everybody eat were getting paranoid with this hunger  here baby eat this  oh my gods thats good thanks insults critics  lama lovechange nikomagnus   somewhere to be danna  dont wake caprica  look id love to hang around with you two all day but  ive got things to do  ill never understand what you all do all day long  living on this thing like fleas on a cat  where do you suppose she takes herself off to then  youre not the only one asking that  im not  what do you mean  shes been doing things  doing things  what things  go ahead i got your helmet   there you go  got it  go ahead walk it through  radiation negative  theres a way through the star cluster  and i found the planet on the other side  i skimmed it and i took photos  theres huge swaths of algae just like we thought  its black  shes a cylon she can handle a radiation dose that big  we think  someone call cottle  im fine  maybe you are but  a human might not be able to make it  so then how do we get tens of thousands of humans through there  so we make it through in two jumps with a stop right there  theres no solution with a single jump  no the clusters too big  and its too big to go around too  but the civvie ships arent shielded enough  to jump in the middle of all that radiation  i would say 80 of the people onboard would die  can we send galactica for food   and put it where  what do you mean  it would take dozens of return trips  each time wed leave the fleet vulnerable to attack  we just cant bring the food to the people  what if we bring the people to the food  put the people on galactica  send the civilian ships with skeleton crew   give em radiation meds  except that the radiation  would fry the civvie ships nav systems  they couldnt see squat on dradis  there wouldnt even be a way to calculate a jump out  its worse than that  once you jump in the light is so blinding you begin to drift  and before you can get your bearings  youre over there  no visual contact instruments blinded by radiation  theyd get lost  theyd burn up  pilot ship  we pair a raptor  with each civilian ship  raptor navigation systems are hardened against nuclear strikes  they can handle the radiation  each raptor could lead a civilian ship through the cluster  then they both jump out together  question is  how many jumps will it take  five round trips  you heard five round trips  on our outbound jumps well each be responsible  for relaying jump coordinates to our own specific civilian ship  nailing them to their jump points and insuring they dont drift off  sir are we gonna get fed when we get there  eventually yes but only after we find the algae and get it processed  the truth is that  nausea from the radiation exposure will take care of our appetites  youll all be issued with radiation badges that track out exposure  white like this youre okay  as your exposure increases itll darken  if it approaches this then youll be pulled from duty  keep checking your badges  its every pilots own responsibility to monitor their own badge  starbuck  remember  were all flying solo on this mission  therell be nobody there to bitch slap you  if you start to get tired or start seeing little toasters on your wing  well be issuing stims so use em  what are you crazy we cant use stims   kat do you have a problem  stims amp up your metabolism  weve got nothing to burn  we take stims well be flying into the sides of the ships   is that true theyd mess us up  you used to like the stims kat  all right personal discretion on the stims  were taking the first load of civilians on board as we speak  thats it skids up in four hours  there is no food here  there are no rations anywhere on this ship  if someone told you there was food they were lying  if you leave this area force will be used  once we get through the star cluster  you will all be returned to your designated ships  sacha  keep following straight down to thefront thats right  my name isnt sacha  my names captain louanne katraine you understand me   sacha and you were a lifetime ago  right  right cause you have this now right  no more hanging with the sinners huh  stay away from me  do you understand me  do they even know who you really are  fancy bumping into you here can you believe im lost again  ill never find my way around this place  where have you been  ive been talking with simon about our next move toward earth  theres some debate about it  of course if i spoke to simon  hed actually ascertain you were at this meeting  i beg your pardon  i hear that youve been going off by yourself doing things  really  now who would tell you anything about my business   so its true  caprica  did you know you have some dried goo in your hair  that can happen when you resurrect  now im beginning to understand  just what youve been doing with yourself all these afternoons  do you have any idea of what you are accusing me of  yes  intentionally killing yourself over and over  so you can download over and over  but deaths just a revolving door isnt it  come here  what do you want  take it down a notch baby relax  im not looking for a business partner  i told you to stay the frak away from me  if they find out who you really are theyll kick you out of the service  or worse  now do you think i want that  i dont want that cause that happens  whos gonna feed me  youre getting three squares you think i dont know that  we dont   i dont have anything stashed enzo  yeah sure you dont  we go back baby  since when is it a crime to take care of your own  remember i know who you are and i know how to make you happy  get your hands off of me  colonel  go ahead  welcome back sir  good to see you sir  enough dont you people have jobs to do  welcome back colonel  admiral  apollo galactica launch raptors on your orders  shepherds find your sheep stay close and never let them go  these crews are counting on us to guide them through  apollo starbuck on station  ive got visual on chrion   hot dog adriatic in sight  okay  when you jump into the cluster you will be disoriented  take it one step at a time find your sheep  work the jump calculations and get them out  remember we do not stay beyond our radiation dose limit  apollo reports pilots in position sir  initiate jump on his command   galactica will follow  aye aye sir  raptors apollo we jump on my mark  three   two  jumping  one mark  what is this i cant see anything  frak  frak  gotcha   kat you got yours  afirmative apollo  only got eyes for the chrion  relaying coordinates  squadron apollo i have thera sita  relaying jump coordinates to her right now  apollo starbuck ive got mine  frak im just barely holding on here  i lost mine  anyone seen adriatic she has lost her jump coordinates  whos that hot dog negative hot dog negative on adriatic  hot dog just ease up on the control man  ease up on the stick this is not a viper  frak it frak it  apollo this is galactica actual  youve reached your radiation dose limit weve got to jump   count us down  roger that galactica  no hold on apollo please wait  hot dog listen to me we have to get out of here now   i can find them  you will jump on my mark  please wait  jump on my mark with or without your ship   copy that  one two three  no please wait  we cant leave without em  frak frak  jump complete  dradis is back online  ship reports moderate hull damage  galactica apollo first trip complete  raptors land your birds  and prepare to jump back for the second group of civilians  we lost the adriatic  its only our first jump  yes it is  star cluster outbound trip 4  carina kat  report your location  kat apollo do you have the carina  negative radiations pissing on my nav  my patch is black  hold it i found her  no frak  kat report  godsdamn it  kat apollo times up we are jumping on my mark   3 2 1 mark  godsdamn it carina  i lost it  i lost it  all right we managed to get another eight ships through  but we still lost one  we gotta get better at tracking our sheep  quicker reaction times out of the jumps  racetrack dont be calling out coordinates to the wrong ship  i got mixed up  keep checking your instruments and recheck them  the instruments are crap  all right  that concludes outbound four  this is return four  one to go  all right get some rest  come on  these are the reports from the doc    200 more ready to drop  its gonna slow down the harvest  the last batch of passengers kicked up some trouble  you get these people to the other side they think theres a diner and a chef  waiting to take their order  when they gonna learn they gotta process the thing first for fraks sake  try telling that to a bunch of empty stomachs  i hear theyre still eating paper is that true  no  paper shortage  not a good sign  no sir  so while you resurrect you see the faces of the final five  the ones that no ones seen  why do you want to know about them  i could be a cylon  i would stop being a traitor to one set of people  and be a hero to another  and have a place to belong  you would help me understand my destiny   have you seen my face  your face  yes my face  i cant remember  i try to get it all down on paper while its still fresh in my mind but  nothing much comes out  its just rubbish i cant remember  cylons humans  were all just trying to discover  who we are  arent we  enzo  yeah  i took the name louanne katraine from a girl  who died two days before the attack on caprica  got me through the background checks  yeah times were rough keep going  i was a drug runner  enzo was my supplier  what do you want we were truckers okay  we just moved stuff  people  you see some think  that thats the way that the cylons infiltrated caprica  they seeded themselves throughout the outer colonies  and then they used criminals to get them into the capital  anyone whos found guilty  of helping the cylons is considered a traitor   we didnt carry cylons  how do you know  because nobody knew that they looked like us  then how do you know you didnt   how do you know  you think im a traitor  you think im a traitor  no  i dont think youre a traitor  youre a smart young woman  thats what the old man said  youre just not smart enough to accept who you are  you see you lied your way into the company of good people  starbuck dont tell the admiral  please   please dont or i  or what  starbuck please just let me tell him myself  please just let me  can you do that  gods   one degree  angle nominal  seascape portrait of the woman child cavern of the soul  under pressureheat ratio  ides of evolutions have buried their fears  so this is where you got the idea  to start intentionally downloading  gestalt theory and escape clauses  right lets see what we can find out  throughout history the nexus between man and machine  has spun some of the most dramatic compelling  gaius   and entertaining fiction  what do you think youre doing  dont touch it  intelligence  a mind that burns like a fire  yes im here  find the hand that lies in the shadow of the light  in the eye of the husband of the eye of the cow  you all right  it just speaks nonsense doesnt it  i dont think anything it says is nonsense  the husband of the eye  of the eye of the  hera  hera sometimes referred to as coweyed hera   and the husband of hera  is jupiter  the eye of jupiter  thats written about in the ancient texts  my god  could their be a connection between their gods and ours  what does that mean  its a location  a planet hidden in the shadow of light probably a cluster of stars  thatll lead us to the eye of jupiter  and to the hand  hidden in the shadow of light  probably some type of artifact  hand  as in five  five faces  now all we have to do is find the right planet  in a star cluster  accept who you are  accept who you are  accept who you are  remember me  yeah  yeah i remember you  thieving bastard  you ruined everything ive got  faru sadin  report your location  kat you got faru sadin  kat you got faru sadin  kat  kat report  negative  kat  frak  i lost the faru sadin  sir  escalating damage reports shipwide  engineers are reporting  a cascade of pressure failures  jump spots become unstable we gotta get out of here   open line  aye sir  channel open  apollo galactica actual  jump all  repeat jump all  all right admirals calling it  everyone jump on my mark  im not losing another one  three two  one mark  apollo starbuck i dont see kat  report  were missing faru sadin   and one raptor  its kat  she mustve missed the order shes still out there  damn  faru sadin this is kat  report your location  frak  come on

id like to be cag very much  thank you  sir there   theres a thing  a reason why you might not want to do this  kara knows what it is  but i wanted to tell you myself  i dont need to know anything
