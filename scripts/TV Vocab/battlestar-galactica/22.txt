                previously on battlestar galactica  we networked the ftl computer with a nav dc and fire control computers  once theyre linked well only need 10 minutes to complete the calculations  really youre going to outthink the cylons at computer software  cylons are hacking our network attempting to access our mainframe    what the hell was that  its the virus sir  i think it must have spawned copies of itself in some other computer systems  its knocked out main power and auxiliary units    i love you chief  what do you want from me helo shes a cylon  im not going to let you kill her  shes carrying my child  i have terminal breast cancer dr cottle will verify the diagnosis  i have a few months to live  fivefourtwoeightniner so how are we feeling today    great    helo thought id find you here    karl agathon    you wanna sit in  maybe next time  so hes the cylon lover  you know what i dont care who or what he fraks  he saved my ass down there all right    how could anyone fall in love with a toaster though  same way i hear everyone was highfiving our sharon  right before she put two in adamas chest  the bastards frak with your head  yeah just ask the chief    i knew it  i need a drink  tanned rested and ready look at you  rested anyway nothing to do but eat and sleep in the can  unauthorized discharge of a firearm what a bogus charge  they should have given you a medal for popping that toaster    chief i heard that you went to bat for me  forget it  i just want you to know forget it  i need all the knuckle draggers i can get  tyrol sharon flew 47 missions in this thing  and still couldnt trap a landing worth a damn  had to bend her undercarriage back into place after every landing  approaches made her nervous she was afraid youd be watching  i usually was  screw it    youre folding with three up are you crazy  not when youve got me beat prince high red right  been playing with these cards for so long i know every fold  so lifes a bitch what do you want to do cry about it  no i just want it to end okay  the bad food the endless rotations  pretending that a card game is the high point of our day  its not going to last forever all right earth is out there   right  we could all be chasing our tails over some halfassed planetarium show  you guys can all go to hell    im gonna go find helo  good idea maybe that cylon whore taught him a few tricks    look chief i never intended for sharon to know that  you know it just kind of evolved  just a couple of lovesick kids huh  i know how she felt about you she loved you  did she fill you in on the rest of the plan  she and i were going to muster out at the end of our service  you know that we would get married  maybe we would have children    i guess im just a big frakking idiot though huh  probably that godsdamn toasters plan all along  dont call her that to sucker some moron  into giving her a kid  but you know what i should probably be grateful to you  probably be grateful you know why  because that freak in her belly couldve been mine    hey you okay sorry  son of a bitch      thats enough chief  you dont get to call it  enough      come on you damn toaster lover        i dont even know why im mad at you  my sharons dead  that thing in the brig  that isnt sharon  roger blue leader say fuel state      what the hell is that  it was us sir but i cant find the source of the transmission  somethings triggering our comm system to broadcast an automatic signal  which the cylons could trace to get a fix on our position  lets assume that for now  update and distribute emergency jump sites  just in case they show up again  dee get me a        im okay sir no no stay down  well get you to doc cottle to make sure everythings okay  mr gaeta find out what happened    im okay  mr gaeta  a power surge energized the board  systems been twitchy ever since the cylons infiltrated our network  mr gaeta this is more than a twitch  the commanders right  i dont care if you have to go through this program line by line fix it  excuse me  you heard me sir im running every diagnostic weve got  checking each line of code could take days  i am not interested in excuses fix it  its not an excuse sir its a frakking fact    mr gaeta yes sir  pull yourself together  im sorry sir    what the hell is his problem  months on the run and what do we have to show for it  casualties deteriorating conditions  this crew needs a rest its finally hitting them saul  our old lives are gone  the only thing we have to look forward to is this  chief wheres 28niner i need her for drills today  she was grounded sir  what for how long permanently  were salvaging what we can but its gone  damn it i need that ship on line  what can i tell you captain engine mounts are shot cockpit seals are cracked  if it was a horse theyd shoot it got something chief  apollo chief come on  work with me here i need your help  what do you want me to do work my crew to death  no just do your best nobodys expecting any miracles    maybe thats the problem  tyrol frak it why not  whats going on chief  all right heres the deal we are going to build a new fighter    what about the rest of the ships  im three days backlogged on repairs as is  this is strictly an offduty project  nobody takes one minute away from regular maintenance and repairs you got it  you dont think we can do this  i wouldnt even know how to begin  what else is new screw you  okay hes talking about fabricating a frame avionics life support  its frakking impossible  you know what then forget you i dont need you  chief wait its not like that  i said forget it  get back to work  thats an order    how much time do i have  weeks a month at the outside  will i be able to work  unless the cancer goes to your brain if that happens    someones a tad aggressive  just shut up and shoot  my gods between you and racetrack its like  having a conversation is like walking through a minefield  and youre the last person who should be lecturing me about manners  from what i hear youve also been riding chief tyrol pretty good  press it    i just reminded him that i expect viper maintenance  to take precedence over his hobby project  starbuck nice  im surprised he didnt take a swing at you  come on starbuck  you dont actually think that piece of junks gonna actually fly do you    fifty cubits says he gets it in the air  yeah and whos gonna fly it its not gonna be me  dont look at me apollo i wasnt looking at you  what  ill fly it  ill fly it  you  me  why  because while everyone else is standing around whining  apollo were whining  the chief is doing something positive  im deeply moved really  honestly i am      his lips are blue   you look like a blueberry  theres no oxygen in here  theres no oxygen in here no oxygen        im out    nice shot    the environmental computer decided that the firing range was over pressurized  and started bleeding out air to compensate  two more minutes we may have been dead  power fluctuations equipment failures  sir i think ive found whats causing it  what is that baltar a cylon logic bomb  a heuristic computer virus  its capable of learning evolving  its probably running in parallel  with every computer in the ship right now  just waiting to be activated  no doubt left behind  when the cylons infiltrated the network col tigh set up  the day you were shot sir  that was weeks ago  why now  most likely sir it took that long for it to crack  our encrypted passcodes  and once that happened it started testing its ability to control our systems  electrical environmental  how do you kill it  well thats the tricky part  if its a cylon virus it is extremely difficult to eradicate  well i guess im pretty lucky then  because i have an expert onboard  tell helo to run this past our prisoner      come on come on  for fraks sakes  son of a bitch  gods damn it    i got it go back to work  its a twoman job chief you want this wing up or not  on three one two three  tyrol great great hold it there pull it that way  sir were continuing to experience power spikes  and equipment failures across the ship thank you  wed better up our alert status  and put our damage control teams on standby  not yet  have you seen the ship that the chief is building  his imaginary fighter i dont need to see it i know its a waste of time  the deck crew doesnt seem to think so  we need to focus on the fleet weve got left  not get bogged down in some pipe dream  you should shut it down it may come to that  this project its giving them something  im not going to take that away until i have to    doc cottle cleared me and i feel like hitting something  okay dont square up dont square up  rotate and just drop the knee    thats nice  now if you want to throw them  ill be you  head in a lock grab the wrist secure the arm  and im just gonna drop the knee rotate 45 okay    are you all right yeah  just like we did in basic  lets bring a live opponent into the mix    man nice and strip the knife    dualla billy  hey hey  how long have you been onboard i just arrived  do you have actual memories of being with the chief before the cylon attack  yeah  im sorry you asked  do you still love him  helo  youre the father of my child  youre the first in my heart and nothing is ever going to change that  all right we have to get to this  dr baltar says its some sort of cylon logic bomb  do you see anything  can you flip  sharon  sharon  sharon  i need to talk to cmdr adama right now why  its a cylon virus all right  its been learning your systems testing adapting finding weak spots  for what  so they can turn galacticas systems against you  crash you into other ships detonate your weapons stores  suffocate the crew  what about you the baby im a liability to them  a mistake  helo this logic bomb will run its course in a matter of hours  once it does the cylons will be on top of us  theyre going to kill us all  cmdr adama  whatever it is you have to say make it quick    well i hate to say it but youve got the cockpit too far back  youre gonna run into cg problems when you maneuver  were not going for maneuverability captain were going for speed  besides you didnt think this thing would fly anyway  well it sure as hell wont with the cockpit rammed up its  dee  hey  apollo what are you doing here communications i think  shes great with hydraulics but this comm system is a mess  tenhut  i had to see this with my own eyes  wont be long before we have the whole clc down here  you working on this class project too apollo  no its good to see someone has a little sense  wheres the chief tool room  aye getting some rack time sir    tigh whats this chief    making solvent sir to clean engine parts  solvent my ass  i know a still when i smell it what the hell are you up to    i need booze to trade for parts  im scrounging most of what i can from the fleet  but i need engines  i know i need cmdr adamas permission  to cannibalize one of the wrecks  engines or not we both know that piece of crap out there is never going to fly  i gotta try colonel  whats the point  because that ship the work thats all ive got left  i dont have that l    i almost forgot i promised the xo of the baah pakal id help him out  sir hes got some obsolete ddg62 engines  thats taking up space on his flight deck  theyre probably crap but i told him that i would have a crew in there  to haul them out as soon as possible  glad to be of help sir good  madam president your shuttles ready of course  thank you again for letting me use your quarters  please  i wanted to return this  this was a gift  never lend a book i know  but ive had it far too long it belongs in your collection  im late for a quorum meeting  is there a problem  our computers have been infected by a cylon virus  corrupting systems throughout the entire ship  ive just been notified that this is a prelude  to an allout attack by the cylons  i assume youve tried to disable it  mr gaeta and the vice president are handling that right now  im not hopeful  commander im not sure what i can offer you here besides my moral support  actually madam president  i could use your advice  you want to what  completely erase our computer drives  cold restart the entire ships system  and then restore them using our prewar backups  leaving us with our pants down until were back online  the commander will never go for this  ive already spoken to him sir  what did he say hes considering it  its the only way to destroy the virus  i thought the commander told you to stay out of this  im sorry do you want to survive this one or not  all right so we calculate a jump and get some distance on these cylon bastards  no sir we cant risk a jump  all of our systems are compromised including navigation  the virus could drop us in the middle of a sun  were running out of time  our signals gonna catch up with the cylon fleet  if we havent come up with anything before then  theyll take control of all of our systems  and then theyll have a hundred ways to kill us  ive just come from seeing our cylon prisoner  shes offering a possible solution to the problem  and youre wondering if you can trust her  it took everything i have  not to put my hands around her throat  i cant believe im contemplating this  we both know the cylons are experts at manipulation  they will do anything to confuse you  this is not the one who shot me  can they really be that different from one another  commander if youre asking me  if its possible that your judgments been clouded  by your history with this particular cylon model  id have to say yes  but  we created them  theres always a chance we might find common ground    we need to work quickly were on borrowed time  let her go guard yes sir  dee do you still carry your fathers pocketknife  give it to her  mr gaeta can you set me up with a fiberoptic comm link  i need broadcast to all frequencies  and direct contact to the mainframe  adama do it  gaeta sir  right here sharon  thanks  gaeta dradis here they come multiple targets    bearing 371 carom 552 cylon raiders  bastards tracked us all right  launch vipers      man on radio apollo the raiders are holding  apollo galactica apollo raiders are holding formation  repeat raiders are holding formation  what the hell  sharon okay this is how its going to work  the raiders are going to send a signal to activate the virus  it could take a few seconds  on my mark initiate the computer wipe  miss the window  the virus takes over every system in the ship  sometimes you gotta roll the hard six right commander    what the hell is she doing    dualla theyve made contact sir  gaeta its moving too fast i cant follow it  we gotta stop this  stand by to execute computer wipe on my command  system is ready sir  wipe the hard drives now  do it  starbuck my gods what are they doing    weapons are still offline no dradis systems down  were looking at a godsdamn bloodbath were defenseless  hotdog apollo hotdog here they come  all right copy hotdog  gods there must be hundreds of them  cylons are still moving in she set us up    give me your sidearm guard yes sir  if theyre coming for you theyre gonna be very disappointed  do it  tigh what are you waiting for  this      what the hell  we just transmitted a signal  galactica they seem to have lost power  theyre drifting out of control  what the hell  cylons sent a computer virus  but we just sent one back  apollo this is galactica kill the bastards  starbuck yeah come on baby  roger that vipers weapons free  engage  this is payback    yeah how do you like that you seeing this  apollo got this toaster padlocked  come on    i got another where that one came from  starbuck guys clean them up come on lets go  officers guard yes sir  take this thing back to its cell      there you go chief  nice to be small huh  ships got more than one engine get to it  starbuck we are so damn close  there has got to be some extra metal lying around  that we can use to skin this thing  floorboards extra bulkheads something  most of its ticketed for viper repair  who says you need metal  carbon composite starbuck good call helo  its gonna be hard as hell to see on dradis  but the question is will it fly  just watch me  starbuck instruments in the green  fuel pressure nominal  apollo starbuck blackbird flight is cleared for launch  runup  man on radio maglock secure initiate launch sequence  dont blow up on me you bastard  clear for launch  dualla blackbird is away  will you take it easy start slow  youre testing the ship its not about the pilot showing off  starbuck whos showing off  apollo gods damn it what is this what are you trying to prove  im not trying to prove anything youve got to be kidding me    oh lords  okay lets see what this baby can do      apollo starbuck where are you  starbuck do you hear me starbuck  man im not shes gone  galactica apollo ive lost her  ive lost her  dualla no dradis contact  apollo starbuck where are you  starbuck come in  starbuck do you read  kara are you okay  of course you lost contact its a damn stealth ship remember  oh you      officer commander on deck  as you were  chief tyrol  this is the blackbird  yes maam madam president this is an honor  no the honors mine its remarkable  just a ship maam  laura youre much too modest  after what weve been through  it would be very easy to give up to lose hope  but not here not today  this is more than a ship chief this is an act of faith  it is proof that despite all weve lost  we keep trying  and we will get through this all of us together  i promise  commander  ahem  madam president  this was supposed to be a surprise  but well  thank you  if youll do us the honors madam president  of course  okay      kidding  hell of an idea using carbon composites  man it was a good job  nice work  that was lovely  they wanted to do that for you thank you  none of this would have been possible if you hadnt trusted the cylon  i took your advice met on common ground  what was that  we both wanted to live
