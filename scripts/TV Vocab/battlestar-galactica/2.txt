time  tigh one  two  three  four  five    roslin do it  apollo i cant stop thinking about the olympic carrier  that was three days ago  its ancient history under these circumstances  leave the secondguessing to the historians  but dont we have a responsibility  i mean as leaders dont we have an obligation to question our actions to  i dont know to make sure the decisions we make are the right decisions  we did what we had to do son  a man takes responsibility for his actions right or wrong  he accepts the consequences and lives with them  every day    lso colonial one galactica proceed to omega docking  contact cic when you have hard seal  pilot roger that galactica  billy excuse me madam president weve arrived  please dont tell me that we have to go through this  every time i step on that ship  no maam but they will always render honours for your arrival its protocol  the military they do love their protocol  im sure if they knew you didnt like it theyd be willing to  roslin no let adama sound the trumpets  it makes him feel more comfortable maybe if he feels more comfortable   hell be a little easier to deal with  thats smart  no its not smart its politics  roslin i think im going to get tired of this outfit  seeing as i only have three for the rest of my life   that looks fine  fine  it looks great  you dont know anything about women do you   shall we  lets go be presidential  i am confident that i speak for the entire fleet when i say thank you  without your extraordinary dedication your tireless effort your sacrifice  no one of us would be here today  im proud to serve as your president thank you    carry on  sir the virgon express is manoeuvring alongside   theyre standing by for unrep  thank you very much d  officer of the watch youll proceed with the unrep please  aye sir  adama if youll step this way roslin thank you   excuse me chief a word with you please  just one second  you know what just lets do it whats up  got a problem  tyrol yes sir lieutenant sir  tyrol i believe the navcon modules are ready for inspection  dualla virgon express galactica we have you in visual contact  maintain current course and speed  pilot roger that galactica maintain current course and speed  powering up stabilisation gyros  galacticas water recycling system is close to 100 effective  for all intents and purposes theres not a drop of water thats wasted aboard  adama we have enough water for several years before replenishing   i see  many of the ships like the virgon express  were not made for longterm voyages   and will have to tank off of us periodically  right  whatever it is were gonna take care of it okay you all right  now tell me what happened whats going on  there are at this moment six g4 detonators  missing from the smallarms locker on deck 15  commander ready to extend the water boom  excuse me  tigh hows it going adama oh boy i feel like a   tour guide  it shows  well she was a teacher  probably sees all this as one big educational experience   he thinks im a total idiot doesnt he  what no sir no  its all right  what are you telling me for  if munitions go missing you got to tell the masteratarms now  boomer i know that  you cant screw around with stuff like this  im not screwing around okay the only reason i didnt tell anybody  is cause theyre gonna think im the one who took them  how are things  dualla things are good billy good  you look good  i really like your hair  my hair    i dont know anything about women  madam president if i may  i think you should know that my father   well this entire ceremony was his idea  i know  i think hes enjoying it  actually he hates protocol pomp and all that   really  hes making a gesture  trying to make you feel like the president  open valves 3 and 5    boomer i took the one detonator from the duffel replaced it  and then i went back to my quarters  well    you know what its not your fault  someones obviously setting you up to take the fall for something  thats what it is  you wake up somewhere you dont know how you got there  youre drugged or manipulated or who knows what something    what do we do  because if i report whats happened theyll think im a cylon agent  no theyre not no why would they think that thats crazy  people are getting crazy okay youve heard the rumours  cylons who look like humans sleeper agents hiding in the fleet      decompression alarm    adama damage report mr gaeta  ruptures in tanks 3 5 7 9  tigh strain on the unrep lines theyre gonna blow  release the lines veer away starboard  every tank on the port side has ruptured  were venting all our water directly into space    cic its dc one were entering the tank  dualla roger that dc one    raptor 478 dc one i have you in my sights  copy that dc one i have you in sight  tyrol understood  hows it look in there can you tell what happened  lieutenant dont worry  about my team ive got things under control  copy that dc one i feel better knowing youre on it  watch the light youre off target  how much water did we lose  ten million jps sir almost 60 of total potable water reserves  emergency rations  shut down laundry showers anything nonessential immediately  yes sir   how long will our water supplies last  aboard galactica about six days  but onethird of the other ships in the fleet were depending on us for replenishment  if we dont find new supplies theyll run out of water in two days  onethird thats 16000 people  get the names of those ships  tell their captains to go on emergency rations immediately  theres gonna be riots in those ships  civilians dont like hearing they cant take a bath wash their clothes   or drink more than a thimble a day  thank you for the warning colonel   thatll be all mr gaeta  one more thing lieutenant  do you have any theories about what may have caused the accident  there are many theories at this point madam president  do you have a guess  i tell my officers not to guess i prefer to wait until we have fact  umhm indulge me  take a guess mr gaeta  id have to say the most likely explanation is  that the tank was structurally weakened during the cylon nuclear detonation  during the first attack and that caused it to buckle and rupture  gaeta but its too early to say sir roslin interesting   thank you lieutenant  back to the matter at hand  ive ordered an astronomical survey of nearby stars systems   for potential water sources colonel  yes sir    chief take a look at this  tyrol what do you got cally not sure  cally it looks like burn marks from an explosive  cally what do you think  umm   its tough to tell its pretty rusted out  optical and xray telescopes say there are five systems  within our practical jump radius  all five have planetary bodies with the potential for finding water  in either a liquid or a frozen state  put together a plan for raptors to scout each star system   i want the first launch at 1730  yes sir  colonel how likely are we to find water on any of these planets  now you want me to guess i take it   colonel  sir  my apologies madam president difficult day for everyone  i understand  most planets are just hunks of rock or balls of gas  the galaxys a pretty barren desolate place when you get right down to it  adama thank you colonel  roslin the water rationingll make our supply problem worse  roslin dr baltar please share the results of your study  ive calculated the rate of consumption regarding basic foodstuffs  for the civilian population  baltar this is based on information available to me at the time  the current civilian population of 45265  will require at minimum     and 25 million jps of water  is that per month  per week    helo they found your raptor  a few or a lot  helo thats what you get for coming back for me  boomer frack helo yeah  i was sure they didnt track me coming in   i know  i set the jiggers to pulse  helo im sure you did  i didnt set off any detection grids any dradis sweeps or pingers   never send a pilot to do an ecos job  i can do your job  i guess thats why the toasters are crawling all over our ride out of here  helo i dont suppose theres a plan b  plans b c d and e are the same as plan a  get off the planet and get back to the ship come on  where are we going  boomer dont ask questions just follow your pilot  yes sir  umm  so far weve found five discrete detonation points in the tank  and we believe that there may be a sixth  ive suspected due to the size of the residual scoring  and the burn points  that we are dealing with a g4 type explosive  so ive requested a spot check of all inventory  from the masteratarms and she indicated to me  that there are six detonators missing from a smallarms locker  in the port flight pod  so one detonator may still be unaccounted for  have the masteratarms post guards at all smallarms lockers immediately  its already done sir she also has opened an investigation  into who may have had access to that locker  however due to spotty recordkeeping  and lax internal security procedures since the attack  she believes that we may never know who took the detonators      adama chief thank you very much  everyone except for col tigh capt adama and dr baltar  are now released  adama please remember this briefing is strictly confidential    there is at least one cylon aboard the galactica    how many people know the cylons look human  the rumour mills been working overtime half the ships talking about it  therell always be rumours for most people thats all theyll ever be  im asking how many people actually know  tigh the five people in this room plus three marines  roslin lets keep it that way once this gets out officially  people will be accusing each other of being cylons for no reason at all  i agree dr baltar howre we doing on the screenings  the screenings  you were supposed to be screening galactica crew for potential cylon agents  no 6 do you remember the first time you lied to a woman  other than your mother that is  baltar other than my mother  sherry bennett fourth grade  on the playground behind the band room  if you show me yours ill show you mine  she did i did not  you know i think i slept with her actually many years later of course  no 6 of course    no 6 did she turn out to be a beautiful woman  as a matter of fact she did  very beautiful  but every woman has her beauty  her feminine charms that are hers and hers alone  adama doctor  doctor  baltar the screenings  to tell you the truth there are significant problems  with implementing my cylon detection method  that i used aboard galactica previously  and basically because ive run out of natural resources  i need chemical compounds for example the precursor test  i need large samples of tetrahydrocycline  which i dont have to tell you maybe i do have to  baltar its a highly volatile chemical adama let me stop you there  your intellect obviously outstrips everyone in this room  but its also obvious by the way that youre talking  that in order to make largescale screenings  youre going to need help staff resources  yes thats exactly what im saying exactly  although more staff  someone snooping around watching your every move  maybe itll be a woman you could find her secret beauty  adama im going to assign lt gaeta to aid you  in anything that you might need  so much for that  but the need for secrecy  clearly this falls into the absolutely necessary category  your screening techniques may be critical to our very survival  humanitys very survival rests in your hands  now if only you had an actual cylon detector  apollo this is a critical mission  apollo fights have already broken out on some ships over the rations  theres panic in the air you dont find water out there and find it soon   i understand captain well find it  good hunting  apollo hey chief tyrol captain   lieutenant  chief  i feel like my heads about to explode  tyrol just relax calm down focus on the mission  well take care of everything when you get back  boomer what about the investigation  masteratarms is running it dont worry theres no connection to you  in fact theres no reason to believe you had anything to do with it at all  boomer i didnt tyrol i know   i would never do something like that never  sharon i know  its really important you believe me on this   you do believe me right  absolutely  tyrol yes sir boomer thank you chief carry on  please excuse me for keeping you waiting  i was called into the engine room itll just take a moment  roslin thats all right  sometime id like to borrow a book or two  i only brought one with me on the flight to galactica  adama what book roslin a murder on picon  roslin i have a weakness for mystery adama ever read dark day  edward prima i am embarrassed to say  its one of those classics ive never gotten around to reading  i think youll enjoy it  thank you    it may be a while before i get this back to you  its a gift never lend books  well then thank you for the gift  im really looking forward to working with you doctor   you have a friend  as am i lieutenant  i actually studied genetics in college  i was planning on going for my graduate degree  through the military extension program  wonderful is that a card game  and the girl wins again another round  come on guys grace under pressure  nothing like losing a little money to take your mind off those 14hour patrols   mind if i sit in lieutenant  lf you got the cubits weve got the chair  of course if youve got anything to drink well take that in lieu of cash  you know i dont have any money but  this jacket must be worth at least 15 cubits  its made of the finest caprican cloth warm in winter cooling in summer  itd look great on you  anybody else got any civilian clothes theyd be interested in putting on the table    dont let me keep you  col tigh was right  rioting broke out on a cruise ship when they reduced water rations  we need to demonstrate an ability to maintain order we need to do it now  we dont have extra manpower for fleet security  you have the only armed disciplined force available  yeah but im not going to be your policeman  theres a reason why you separate military and the police  one fights the enemy of the state the other serves and protects the people  when the military becomes both  then the enemies of the state tend to become the people  i appreciate the complexity of the issue and i wont let that happen   ill send troops to the cruise ship  commander i wont let that happen     beginning dradis one sweep  beginning dradis two sweep  so im thinking we should give this lovely little rock of nothing a name   im thinking kimiko  kimiko  after a lovely little lady in a lovely little city in a lovely little colony   that i used to know  whatever        sorry so sorry you had such a good run though  looks like the bets to me  baltar ill try and muddle through for another round  im going to raise you five  no guts no glory doctor ill see your five  and raise you 20  now its just you and me  im not used to playing in this kind of highstakes game  starbuck its not too late to bow out  now theres an excellent suggestion and before proceeding any further  i should really examine my motivations for doing so  staying in the game i run the risk of losing my entire stake  and being humiliated in front of these lovely people  humiliated is a such a strong word  embarrassed would be my choice  you do play rough dont you  starbuck a little too rough for you  my hands not that strong it wouldnt take much to knock me out of the game  well thank you doctor    however without a little risk  life would be so dull wouldnt it calling    three on a run  baltar full colours    thank you all for a most pleasant evening  a parting gift  baltar handrolled from some of the finest fumarello leaf in caprica  and its also one of the last left in the universe  thank you  my pleasure    excuse me  the raptors have reported back after three star systems   so far all report negative for water sir  i just checked with astrometrics  theyre coming up with big goose eggs  theres no star systems within the range of our telescopes  with planetary bodies likely to have water on them  sir another raptor just checked in negative on water as well  adama whos left dualla boomer and crashdown sir  if they come up negative as well  whats our backup plan  well jump to another sector and start the search all over again   needle in a haystack  more like grain of salt on a beach    still nothing and  more nothing  i got nothing here either  crashdown then thats it  five moons five zeroes im getting thirsty just thinking about it  hope somebody else has more luck out there  yeah  crashdown whats on your mind boomer  i dont know i have this feeling   lets run that last sweep again  youre the boss   beginning sweep 21  beginning sweep 22  crashdown boomer im getting nothing again how about you    boomer im having trouble saying it crashdown what do you mean    i think i see  oh  i have positive contact yeah    oh yes yeah  good call boomer  sir dradis just picked up boomers raptor  adama lets hear it  crashdown galactica crashdown  dradis sweeps indicate its time to break out the swimsuits  because weve found water repeat positive water contact    patch me in to the entire fleet  youre connected sir  attention this is the commander  we have found water    lets go have a drink  i think theyre pleased i can hear them screaming in the background      helo sharon be careful with that needle  were running low on antiradiation medicine   not really moms home cooking  yeah it beats eating grass and leaves  well be cooking up a fine meal of twigs and moss by the end of the week  you spoil me  can i ask you something sharon whyd you come back for me  i hate to fly alone  come on you disobeyed orders flew back into this hellhole  and not that i dont appreciate it but why  i just couldnt leave you behind lets leave it at that    its a colonial fleet signal  i cant decode it but it means theres someone  someone in the military is still alive and kicking here in caprica  yes    now all we have to do is find them     way to go boomer  nice work sir   nice job lets get you debriefed  yes sir  chief you think you could take a look at my ejection pyros  boomer i think theres a short tyrol yeah cally  no chief you could take a look at it yourself    roslin thank you for coming capt apollo  i am aware that you were in charge  of the mission that destroyed the olympic carrier  roslin i know what a hard thing that is to live with for all of us  roslin im struggling with it myself frankly  apollo i cant stop thinking about it    but a man has to accept responsibility for his actions  he doesnt secondguess the choices he makes  he lives with them every day  you know i remember when president adar sent the marines into aerilon  roslin fifteen people died  roslin in public of course he had to say all the usual things  he was sure of what hed done he made the right choice  he stayed the course  but he knew it was a mistake  roslin and he kept the names of the dead in his desk drawer  he said that it was imperative for a leader  to remember and learn from the mistakes  even if they cant admit to them publicly   you think we made a mistake  i dont know  roslin i dont have a desk drawer yet but i have a pocket  roslin i dont want to add to your burdens however  i have a request i would like you to be my personal military advisor  im sorry  my father is the senior military officer he should advise you  no i dont mean to go behind your fathers back nothing like that  im not looking for military advice im looking for advice about the military  roslin that little insight about your father making a gesture that really helped me  it made me reassess the man i would appreciate more of those insights  and you can keep your day job at the cag  its pronounced cag  do you see why i need you  so whos going to tell my father  well  i was thinking that  that would be your first assignment  somehow i knew you were going to say that  thank you captain  hey  boomer that is just what i needed tyrol oh yeah   did you find that detonator  yes i did   i gave it to masteratarms  what  tyrol no no i told her i found it during maintenance  listen calm down this is the best way to go about this okay  that puts them on the same trail were on  and it doesnt raise any suspicion of you  listen trust me on this sharon  im not going to let anything happen to you okay   okay  all right okay  tyrol dont worry sweetie   i better go  all right
