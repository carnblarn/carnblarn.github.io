                when they write about this plague in the history books  they will write about woodbury  we persevered  previously on amcs the walking dead  theres no way merles gonna live here  without putting everyone at each others throats  say goodbye to your pop for me  daryl are you serious  daryl  my friends are still alive and were shooting at each other  your friends killed six good people   do you know what he did to her  leave it alone  do you know  what do you want from me  dad  why are you no   may i  that was uh  that was quite a speech you gave  exactly what these people needed to hear  what about the prison  as long as they leave us alone we have no problem   so no retaliation  no  what would that get us  i need to go see them  i thought this place could be something else you know  something better  i wasnt up to the challenge and i screwed it up  ive done some terrible things  im not fit to lead these people  but you are  they dont need to be terrorized  certainly not by their own leader  so youre abdicating  you know i really believed  if i kept her alive long enough  milton would find a  i just need time  to get myself together  so you want me to fill in for you  who else can milton martinez  if you choose your friends in the prison id understand  but these people need you  i  we need you  there aint nothing out here but mosquitoes and ants  patience little brother  sooner or later a squirrel  is bound to scurry across your path  even so that aint much food  more than nothing  id have better luck going through one of them houses  we passed back on the turnoff  is that what your new friends taught you hmm  how to loot for booty  weve been at it for hours  why dont we find a stream try to look for some fish  i think youre just trying to lead me back to the road man   get me over to that prison  they got shelter  food a pot to piss in  might not be a bad idea  for you maybe  aint gonna be no damn party for me  everyone will get used to each other  theyre all dead  makes no difference  how can you be so sure  right about now hes probably hosting a housewarming party  wheres he gonna bury whats left of your pals  lets hook some fish  come on  right  now you said you found tyreeses group here   yeah  we secured this  he thought he came through here  means theres another breach  okay  the whole front of the prison is unsecure  if walkers just strolled in  then its gonna be cake for a group of armed men  why are we even so sure hes going to attack  maybe you scared him off  he had fish tanks full of heads  walkers and humans trophies  hes coming   we should hit him now  what  he wont be expecting it  well sneak back in and put a bullet in his head  were not assassins  you know where his apartment is  you and i could end this tonight  ill do it myself  okay  he didnt know you were coming last time  and look what happened  you were almost killed  daryl was captured  and you and maggie were almost executed  you cant stop me  rick would never allow this  you really think hes in any position to make that choice  think this through clearly tdog lost his life here  lori too the men that were here  it isnt worth any more killing  what are we waiting for if hes really on his way  we should be out of here by now   and go where  we lived on the road all winter  back when you had two legs and we didnt have a baby  crying for walkers every four hours  we cant stay here  we cant run  all right well stay put  were gonna defend this place  were making a stand  carl you and i will go down to the tombs  we need to figure out where the breach is   you got it  youll need some help  no in case anything happens i need you out here  whos on watch  damn it  ahem  alpha waves  i was trying to induce a meditative state  ive been having trouble  your battery its over here  yeah youre holding look at this jackpot  youve been invaluable  do you intend to stay  leavings never crossed my mind  good  cause i count on you and not just for your  your expertise  but i consider you a friend  i thank you  i feel  me too  i counted on merle as well  martinez hes a good soldier  hed take a bullet if i needed him to  would you  i would  yes  and andrea  im not sure where her loyalties lie  i can see how her previous affiliation  with merle no matter how contentious it was  could cause doubt  you keep tabs on her for me  of course  wheres martinez  i dont know  did you see him leave  yeah  who was he with  karen its okay you can tell me  i dont know anything  milton  milton stop  you startled me  where is he  wheres who  the governor  hes out on a run  is that an answer or a question  im not sure where he is  i mean not whether it was a question or an answer   it was an answer  a run meaning what specifically  supplies would be a safe bet  we were wiped out  milton i want you to give me a specific answer  to a specific question wheres the governor  on a run  you know i bet hell be back soon  im sure hes okay if thats what youre worried about  the tombs outside the boiler room are overrun again  that whole section had been cleared  its a steady stream of walkers  were wasting time  the governor is supposedly on the way and were stuck in here with walkers  trapped between a rock and a hard place  for the last time running is not an option  glenn if the tombs have filled up again  it may just be a matter of time before they push in here  or until some fence gives way  what if one of them herds is passing through  or settled  cant handle that with just the few of us  okay  all right we need  we just need to scout the far side of the prison   find out whats going on  youre going out there   take a car and make it quick  ill drive  no you stay here help with the fortifications  ill take maggie  you sure shes up to that  where have you been  we need to find out how the walkers are getting into the tombs  are we gonna talk about this  maggie you need to talk about it  i do or you do   what does that mean  what do you want me to say  you want me to say he made me get naked and stand in front of him  he came up behind me  pushed himself against me  put his hands all over me  he slammed my head down and bent me over a table  did he  rape me  no  no  do you feel better   im not trying to  i had a choice  either i take off my shirt or he would take off your hand  i just listened to merle beating the shit out of you in the other room  what could i do  im sorry  go away  you got your answer  now go away  so well reinforce this with some metal from the yard  if anything happens  well just duck  i hope nothing happens  guns scare the bejesus out of me  i robbed a gas station with a toy gun  never even took it out of my pocket  you said oscar was the thief  that you were in here for pharmaceuticals  well i didnt want yall to think i was a violent man  if you follow me  so what are you saying  youre in here for a toy gun  no listen to this  the next day the cops found me at my brothers house  still had the water pistol in my pocket  i swore up and down that that was the only weapon i had  but they said they didnt believe anyone could be so
