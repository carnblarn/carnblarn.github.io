our connecting flight never connected  they wouldnt let us leave the terminal so  we slept next to these huge  marble sculptures from zimbabwe  then on the fourth night  the things just came through  there were a lot of us and  now its just eddie and me  and i wouldnt have made it  if it wasnt for him  and it isnt that  he saved me over and over again  or that he showed me the things  that i had to do or  to be willing to do  if he wasnt still here  i i couldnt be  i just i couldnt  what were they  what  the things you had to be willing to do  um  eating whatever we could find  animal carcasses  and rotten fruit and  leaving people behind  hiding from people who needed my help  unlike you  this is not charity  you have to have numbers  people are the best defense against walkers  or people  we help each other  you call them walkers  you all right you cut or something  no man but my foot is caught  all right hes just caught come on help me up   what happened  everyones all right were over in wine and beer  i was moving fast man i drove right into the drinks  man you lucked out if this thing had come down on you the wrong way  yeah uh we should probably go now  bobs
