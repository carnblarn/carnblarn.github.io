oh yeah  its a sweet piece  it was a gift  from my father  he gave it to me just before amy and i took off on our road trip  he said two girls on their own  should be able to defend themselves  smart man your father  look its a  its a limited capacity  see only holds seven rounds  oh jeez  aw no  see a way through  uh maybe we should just go back   theres an interstate bypass  we cant spare the fuel  jeez  i said it didnt i say it  a thousand times dead in the water  problem dale  just a small matter of being stuck in the middle of nowhere  with no hope of  okay that was dumb  if you cant find a radiator hose here  theres a whole bunch of stuff we can find  i can siphon more fuel from these cars for a start   maybe some water  or food  this is a graveyard  i dont know how i feel about this  all right all right here we go   come on yall  just look around  gather what you can  kids dont look   which one  the flathead  radiator hose clamp is always a flathead  here you do it  learn something  ed never let me wear nice things like this  were gonna need clothes  hey carl  always within my sight okay  you too sophia  its all good  okay  all right  glenn  were we short on water  save me some  its like being baptized man  oh christ  lori under the cars  carl sophia get down now   carl and sophia sophia  shh shh get under  ow  what  shh  oh  okay  shit  shh  lori   theres two walkers are after my baby  shh shh  shh shh   are you all right are you okay  shoot them  no no  those walkers on the road would hear it  then it wouldnt be just two itd be hundreds  come here come on  all right just hold here  you stay there wait  come on  sophia you have to do exactly as i say  hide in there squeeze in tight   ill draw them away from you  no no dont leave me  listen listen listen listen  they dont get winded i do  i can only deal with them one at a time  i wouldnt be able to protect you  this is how we both survive you understand  okay go go go go  if i dont make it back run back to the highway  back to the others straight the way we came  keep the sun on your left shoulder  come on  you ugly son of a bitch come on  come on  come on  come on  come on  sure this is the spot  i left her right here  i drew the walkers way off in that direction up the creek  without a paddle seems where weve landed  she was gone by the time i got back here  i figured she just took off and ran back to the group  i told her go that way  and keep the sun on her left shoulder  hey short round why dont you step off to one side  youre mucking up the trail  assuming she knows her left from her right  shane she understood me fine  kids tired and scared man  she had her a close call with two walkers  got to wonder how much of what you said stuck  got clear prints right here  she did like you said headed back to the highway   lets spread out make our way back  she couldnt have gone far  hey we gonna find her  shell be tuckered out hiding in a bush somewhere  she was doing just fine till right here  all she had to do was keep going  she veered off that way  why would she do that  maybe she saw something that spooked her made her run off  a walker  i dont see any other footprints  just hers  so what do we do all of us press on  no better if you and glenn get back up to the highway  people are gonna start panicking  let them know were on her trail doing everything we can  but most of all keep everybody calm  ill keep em busy scavenging cars  think up a few other chores ill keep em occupied  come on  why arent we all out there looking why are we moving cars  we have to clear enough room so i can get the rv  turned around as soon as its running  now that we have fuel we can double back  to a bypass that glenn flagged on the map  going backs going to be easier than trying to get through this mess  were not going anywhere till my daughter gets back  hey that goes without saying  rick and daryl theyre on it okay   just a matter of time  cant be soon enough for me  im still freaked out from that herd that passed us by   or whatever youd call it  yeah what was that  all of them just marching along like that  a herd that sounds about right  weve seen it its like the night camp got attacked  some wandering pack only fewer  okay  come on people we still got a lot to do  lets stay on it lets go come on  tracks are gone  no theyre faint  but they aint gone  she came through here  how can you tell  i dont see anything dirt grass  you want a lesson in tracking or you want to find that girl  and get our ass off that interstate   shane  carl what happened  i found something cool  shane check it out  its an arsenal  thats cool bud go give em to dale  check this one out  whoa its a hatchet   be careful dont play with those  theyre really sharp   what did i just say  can i keep one   are you crazy  no way  shane shane tell her to let me keep one  hey man go give them all to dale now go   what was that  what was what  the way you blew him off just now you crushed him  i dont believe you youre giving me the cold shoulder  isnt that what you want  arent you the one who said stay the hell away from him and you  you forget what happened at the cdc  your little meltdown in the rec room slip your mind   when you tried  when i tried to what  what do you think that was  i think it is pretty plain what that was  a mistake one that i admit to  i have a few mistakes under my belt lori  so do you  no debate there  but shane we need to stop this  why do you think im prepping my new ride  im leaving  leaving  as in gone for good  gonna quietly slip away first chance i get  the emergency alert system has been activated  the office of civil defense has issued the following message  normal broadcasting will cease immediately   this is a civil emergency  is that a local signal  its got to be within  avoid anyone infected at all costs remain calm  help is on the way  the emergency alert system has been activated  asshole  okay lets get back to work  sophia  what are you looking for  skin under the fingernails  it fed recently  theres flesh caught in its teeth  yeah what kind of flesh  only one way to know for sure  here ill do it  how many kills you skin and gut in your life  anyway mine is sharper  now comes the bad part  yeah hoss had a big meal not long ago  i feel it in there   heres the gut bag  i got this  this gross bastard had himself a woodchuck for lunch  at least we know  at least we know  its late gonna be dark soon  theyll find her  wheres my gun  you have no right to take it  you dont need that just now do you  my father gave it to me its mine  i can hold onto it for you  or you can give it back to me  everything cool  no i want my gun back  i dont think its a good idea right now  why not  im not comfortable with it  the truth is  less guns we have floating around camp the better  you turning over your weapon  no  but im trained in its use  thats what the rest of yall need is proper training  but until that time i think its best if dale keeps them all accounted for  uhhuh  mind telling me what thats about  oh god theyre back  you didnt find her  her trail went cold  well pick it up again at first light  you cant leave my daughter out there on her own  to spend the night alone in the woods  out in the darks no good  wed just be tripping over ourselves more people get lost  but shes 12 she cant be out there on her own   you didnt find anything  i know this is hard  but im asking you not to panic  we know she was out there  and we tracked her for a while  we have to make this an organized effort  daryl knows the woods better than anybody  ive asked him to oversee this  is that blood   we took down a walker  walker oh my god  there was no sign it was ever anywhere near sophia  how can you know that  we cut the son of a bitch open made sure  oh god  how could you just leave her out there to begin with  how could you just leave her  those two walkers were on us  i had to draw them off  it was her best chance  sounds like he didnt have a choice carol  how was she supposed to find her way back on her own  shes just a child shes just a child  it was my only option the only choice i could make  im sure nobody doubts that  my little girl got left in the woods  everybody takes a weapon  these arent the kind of weapons we need   what about the guns  weve been over that  daryl rick and i are carrying  we cant have people popping off rounds every time a tree rustles  its not the trees im worried about  say somebody fires at the wrong moment  a herd happens to be passing by  see then its game over for all of us  so you need to get over it  the idea is to take the creek up about five miles  turn around and come back down the other side  chances are shell be by the creek  its her only landmark  stay quiet and stay sharp  keep space between you but always stay within sight of each other  everybody assemble your packs  keep on those repairs  weve got to get this rv ready to move  we wont stay here a minute longer than we have to  good luck out there  bring sophia back  keep an eye on carl while were gone  im going with you  you need people right to cover as much ground as possible  your call i cant always be the bad guy  well he has all of you to look after him  id say hes in good hands  okay okay  but always within our sight no exceptions  andrea im begging you dont put me in this position  im not going out there without my gun  ill even say please  im doing this for you  no dale youre doing it for you  you need to stop what do you thinks gonna happen  im gonna stick it in my mouth and pull the trigger the moment you hand it to me  i know youre angry at me  that much is clear  but if i hadnt done what i did  youd be dead now  jenner gave us an option i chose to stay   you chose suicide  so whats that to you you barely know me   i know amys death devastated you  keep her out of this  this is not about amy this is about us  and if i decided that i had nothing left to live for  who the hell are you to tell me otherwise  to force my hand like that   i saved your life  no dale  i saved yours you forced that on me  i didnt want your blood on my hands  and that is the only reason i left that building  what did you expect what id have some kind of epiphany  some lifeaffirming catharsis  maybe just a little gratitude  gratitude  i wanted to die my way  not torn apart by drooling freaks  that was my choice  you took that away from me dale   but  but you know better  all i wanted after my sister died was to get out  of this endless horrific nightmare we live every day  i wasnt hurting anyone else  you took my choice away dale  and you expect gratitude  i dont know what to say  im not your little girl  im not your wife and i am sure as hell not your problem  thats all there is to say  shane look  dad said i could carry it and mom said as long as i was  keep it down were looking for sophia  you need to focus on the task   got to keep up  i am   you okay  i think shanes mad at me   did i do something wrong  no  no honey i promise you  hes justhes worried about sophia thats all  come on  she could be in there  could be a whole bunch of things in there  carol  call out softly  if shes in there yours is the first voice she should hear  sophia sweetie  are you in there  sophia its mommy  sophia were all here baby  its mommy  daryl  daryl  it aint her   whats in there  some guy  did what jenner said opted out  aint that what he called it  what direction  i think that way im pretty sure  damn its hard to tell out here  if we heard them maybe sophia did too  someones ringing those bells maybe calling others  or signaling they found her  she could be ringing them herself  aint you supposed to be fixing that radiator  what if they come back with sophia  and rick wants to move on right away   i had it fixed yesterday  what  what was all that rubbing and sanding for then   that just bullshit  yeah thats one word  another word would be pantomime  just for show  no one else needs to know that  pantomime  if the others know were mobile  theyll want to mobilize and move on  so you dont think theyre gonna find sophia that it  im just guarding against the worst  sooner or later if shes not found  people will start doing math  i want to hold off the needsofthemany  versustheneedsofthefew arguments as long as i can  that is one tricky hose huh  very  that cant be it got no steeple no bells  rick  sophia  yo jc you taking requests  im telling you its the wrong church its got no steeple rick  theres no steeple  a timer its on a timer  im gonna go back in for a bit  are you really leaving  dont you think its best for all of us  i think it is what made you decide  gotta back away just trying to be the good guy here lori  even if you dont see it none of this was intended  i hope you know that  well dont matter as long as i said it  youre just gonna disappear youre not even gonna tell rick  hed only try to stop me no thats on you  you tell him what you want or tell him nothing at all   youre his wife  and carl we dragged him into this   i love carl  he thinks you hate him  im trying to put some distance im trying to make this easier  this aint easy on any of us least of all me  im the one who loses you  father forgive me  i dont deserve your mercy  i prayed for safe passage from atlanta and you provided  i prayed for ed to be punished  for laying his hands on me  and for looking at his own daughter  with whatever sickness was growing in his soul  i prayed youd put a stop to it  give me a chance to raise her right  help her not make my mistakes  shes so fearful  shes so young in her way  she hasnt had a chance  praying for eds death was a sin  please dont let this be my punishment  let her be safe  alive and safe  please lord  punish me however you want  but show mercy on her  im coming with you  i dont know what the hell youre talking about  im not stupid and im certainly not deaf   look i dont know the story  there is no story  fine i dont care dont confuse me with someone who does  look all i care about is getting out of here  as far away as i can like you  were gonna sail off into the sunset together we gonna hold hands  im not asking you to go steady shane im asking for a ride  a chance to start over somewhere else  you observe this group lately  i have i see two people who dont belong  were the odd men out  between the two of us we make a great third wheel  so what say we do we just run off  whats in it for me except for the extra ass i got to cover  the chance to do something for someone else   yeah  and a door that swings both ways  put a gun in my hand ill cover your ass too  think it over  got to move here man  these people are spent  theres only so many hours of daylight left   we still got a long way back  i cant stop yet  we still got a lot of ground to cover  whole other side of the creek bed  so we search that on the way back  she would have heard those church bells she could be nearby   she could be a lot of things  i cant go back  her being out here is my fault  thats great  now they got you doubting yourself huh  what about you you doubt me  hey we can assign all kinds of blame  this means something finding her  oh man  it would be the miracle we need we cant give up  mmm  ahem  yall gonna follow the creek bed back okay daryl youre in charge  me and rick were just gonna hang back  search this area another hour or so just to be thorough  youre splitting us up you sure  yeah well catch up to you  i want to stay too  im her friend   just be careful okay  i will  when did you start growing up  ill be along soon enough  here take this  remember how to use it  im not taking your gun and leaving you unarmed  here got a spare take it   give me a minute  yeah  come on  i dont know if youre looking at me with what  sadness  scorn  pity  love  maybe its just indifference  i guess you already know im not much of a believer  i guess i just chose to put my faith elsewhere  my family mostly  my friends  my job  the thing is we  i could use a little something  to help keep us going  some kind of  acknowledgment  some indication im doing the right thing  you dont know how hard that is to know  well maybe you do  hey look i dont need all the answers  just a little nudge a sign  any sign will do   get what you needed  guess ill find out  so this is it  this the whole plan  i guess the plan is to whittle us down  into smaller and smaller groups  carrying knives and pointy sticks  i see you have a gun  why you want it  here take it  im sick of the looks youre giving me  all of you  honey i cant imagine what youre going through  and i would do anything to stop it  but you have got to stop blaming rick  it is in your face every time you look at him  when sophia ran he didnt hesitate did he  not for a second  i dont know that any of us would have gone after her the way he did  or made the hard decisions that he had to make  or that anybody could have done it any differently  anybody  yall look to him and then you blame him when hes not perfect  if you think you can do this without him go right ahead  nobody is stopping you  we should keep moving  shane  oh no no  no no no no
