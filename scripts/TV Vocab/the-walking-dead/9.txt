                previously on amcs the walking dead   was he bit  shot  i have to open him up find the bleeder and stitch it  you need a respirator  the thought of her out here by herself  were gonna locate that little girl  shes gonna be just fine  two miles down is our farm youll see the mailbox  pressures dropping we cant wait much longer  if shane said hell be back hell be back  the walking dead s02e03 save the last one  made by mikhel for subtituloses  rick just  youve got to keep your strength up  lori did you  i mean it was legendary  did you ever hear about the time shane stole kingsleys car  yeah  the principals car  right out of the teachers lot  in the middle of a school day  shane steps out of lunch and makes a beeline  to kingsleys hyundai   wires the ignition peels out drives down dylan drive  to that chicken farm out there  youve heard this before right  so he pulls it into one of the big holding pens  kingsley he waxed that thing every month  had the auto shop vacuum it out every week  shane he parks it in this huge pen  with a couple of hundred rhode island reds  he busts open bags of seed in the back seat  rolls down all the windows  and then starts sprinting back to school  its three miles away easy  hes back in time to finish his sandwich before the bell  and then the bell rings  shane gets up and when he runs into kingsley in the hallway  he looks out the window and says  principal kingsley  your coupes gone  coupe like chicken coop  i get it  of course you do  youve heard this story 1000 times  what you said before youre right  shanes gonna make it back with what the doctor needs  hell make it back  hershel said you need to eat  carls gonna be all right  please for me  youve got to keep your strength up  i need my clip now  im gonna walk the road look for the girl  im coming too  im going for a walk shine some light in the forest  if shes out there give her something to look at  you think thats a good idea right now  dale  those windows whats on the other side  about a 20foot drop with nothing to catch you maybe some bushes   then the athletic field  we just need enough time  we got to get up there we got to get em open and get out   not me maybe you  hey hey hey  come on man look at me you really think i can squeeze through  one of them tiny windows theyd be all over us  look we lay down some fire to get a head start  you stay here i hop down and draw them away  that gives you the chance to get up the bleachers and out a window  and where do you go  locker room down those steps  looks like a good way to get trapped  its got windows too and more my size  i get out through one i double back we meet up out on the field  youre a crazy son of a bitch aint you  just trying to do right for that boy  you take three shots and you go  after that i fire ill lay down a cover for you   ill get you a lead  all right  oh god  so do we ring the bell  i mean it looks like people live here  were past this kind of stuff arent we  having to be considerate  did you close the gate up the road when you drove in  uh hi  yes we closed it  did the latch and everything  hello nice to see you again  we met before briefly  look we came to help there anything we can do  its not a bite i cut myself pretty bad though  well have it looked at ill tell them youre here  we have some painkillers and antibiotics  i already gave him some if carl needs any  come on inside ill make you something to eat  hey  hey  um were here okay  thank you  whatever you need  they dont get back soon were gonna have a decision to make  and that is  whether to operate on your boy without the respirator   you said that wouldnt work  i know  its extremely unlikely but we cant wait much longer  you really think were gonna find sophia  you got that look on your face  same as everybody else  what the hells wrong with you people   we just started looking  well do you  it aint the mountains of tibet its georgia  she could be holed up in a farmhouse somewhere  people get lost and they survive   it happens all the time  shes only 12  hell i was younger than her and i got lost  nine days in the woods eating berries  wiping my ass with poison oak  they found you  my old man was off on a bender with some waitress  merle was doing another stint in juvie  didnt even know i was gone  i made my way back though  went straight into the kitchen and made myself a sandwich  no worse for wear  except my ass itched something awful  im sorry  im sorry that is a terrible story  only difference is sophias got people looking for her  i call that an advantage  maybe this isnt a world for children anymore  yeah well we have a child  carl is here in this world now  maybe he shouldnt be  maybe this is how its supposed to be  you cant mean that  okay all right  i can understand that thought crossing your mind  it didnt cross my mind rick i cant stop thinking it  why do we want carl to live in this world  to have this life  so he can see more people torn apart in front of him  so that he can be hungry and scared  for however long he has before he  so he can run and run and run and run  and then even if he survives he ends up  he ends up just another animal who doesnt know anything except survival  if he  if he dies tonight  it ends for him  tell me why it would be better another way  what changed  what  jenner offered us a way out  you asked him to let us keep trying  you begged him  for as long as we can  you said what changed  there was a moment the other day  it was just a second but i forgot jacqui was dead  i turned around i wanted to tell her something  i almost said her name it was just a second and then i remembered  but then i realized she didnt have to see any of it  the highway the herds sophia carl getting shot  she didnt  she doesnt have to be afraid anymore  hungry angry  it hasnt stopped happening rick  its like we live with a knife at our throats every second of every day  but jacqui doesnt not anymore  and then  i thought maybe jenner was right  i dont accept that  i cant accept that  that man surrendered it doesnt matt  it doesnt matter what he said  none of it  you really think it would be better if carl  if we just gave up  tell me why it would be better the other way  please  man i thought id lost you  that was my last rifle round   mine too  come on  come on come on   where are we  hey little man  thats hershel  were in his house  you had an accident   all right  it hurts a lot  oh baby i know i know   you should have seen it  what  the deer  it was so pretty mom  it was so close  ive never been  carl  what is happening  dont its a seizure  if you hold him down you could hurt him   you cant stop it  he has to just go through it  his brain isnt getting enough blood  his pressure is bottoming he needs another transfusion   okay im ready  if i take any more out of you  your body could shut down you could go into a coma   or cardiac arrest  youre wasting time  come on man we need a way out   just let me catch my breath  come on  cant sleep  im gonna wait for them to come back  you can go down and sleep if you want to  no we can keep watch together  which way did they go  what the hell  got bit fever hit  world gone to shit might as well quit  dumbass didnt know enough to shoot himself in the head  turned himself into a big swinging piece of bait  and a mess  you all right  trying not to puke   go ahead if you gotta  no im fine  lets just talk about something else for a minute   howd you learn to shoot  gotta eat  thats one thing these walkers and us have in common  i guess its the closest hes been to food since he turned  hanging up there like a big pinata  the other geeks came and ate all the flesh off his legs  i thought we were changing the subject  call that payback for laughing about my itchy ass  there wasnt a lot that came up  huh  lets head back  arent you gonna  no he aint hurting nobody  aint gonna waste an arrow either  he made his choice opted out  let him hang  you want to live now or not  its just a question  an answer for an arrow  fair  i dont know if i want to live  or if i have to  or if its just a habit  not much of an answer  waste of an arrow  you dont need to worry shes with daryl  if something happens he can protect her  you hear what im saying  sorry all i heard was if something happens  you mind keeping watch  i dont know how to use that  i wont be gone long  if you see anything call out  im not going far ill hear you  you got here right in time  this couldnt go untreated much longer  merle dixon  is that your friend with the antibiotics  no maam merles no longer with us  daryl gave us those his brother  not sure id call him a friend  he is today this doxycycline might have just saved your life  you know what merle was taking it for  the clap  um venereal disease  thats what daryl said  id say merle dixons clap was the best thing to ever happen to you  im really trying not to think about that  are you praying  why do you sneak up on people so much  youre easy to sneak up on  i was praying  i was trying to  you religious you pray a lot  actually this was my first try  ever  wow sorry  i didnt mean to wreck your first time  god probably got the gist   praying for what  my friends  looks like they could all use a little help right now  you think  you think god exists  i always took it on faith  lately ive wondered  everything thats happened  there must have been a lot of praying going on  it seems quite a few went unanswered  thanks this is really helping  sorry go ahead  really  you gonna watch  ill get you a refill instead  i know its not my business  and feel free to believe in god  but the thing is youve got to make it okay somehow  no matter what happens  before it happened  we were standing there in the woods  and this deer  just crossed right in front of us  i swear it just planted itself there  and looked carl right in the eye  and i looked at carl  looking at that deer and that deer looking right back at carl  and that moment just  slipped away  it slipped away  thats what he was talking about when he woke up  not about getting shot  or what happened at the church  he talked about something beautiful  something living  theres still a life for us  a place maybe like this  it isnt all death out there  it cant be  we just have to be strong enough  after everything weve seen to still believe that  why is it better for carl to live even in this world  he talked about the deer lori  he talked about the deer  oh shit  got to get to the street double back
