                last season on amcs the walking dead  we have to go  rick  were all infected  we all carry it  you want me to bring a baby into this  to live a short cruel life  i killed shane  were not safe with him  if youre staying you want things straight  this isnt a democracy anymore  psst    we got no place left to go  when this herd meets up with this one well be cut off  well never make it south  what would you say that was about 150 head  that was last week it could be twice that by now  this river could have delayed them  if we move fast we might have a shot to tear right through there  yeah but if this group joins with that one  they could spill out this way  so were blocked  only thing to do is double back at 27  and swing towards greenville  yeah we picked through that already  its like we spent the winter going in circles  yeah i know i know  at newnan well push west havent been through there yet  we cant keep going house to house  need to find someplace to hole up for a few weeks  all right it cool if we get to the creek  before we head out wont take long  we got to fill up on water we can boil it later  knock yourself out  she cant take much more of this moving about  what else can we do let her give birth on the run  do you see a way around that  hey while the others wash their panties  lets go hunt  that owl didnt exactly hit the spot  thats a shame   watch the backside  got it  hurry hurry  its perfect  if we can shut that gate  prevent more from filling the yard  we can pick off these walkers  well take the field by tonight  so how do we shut the gate  ill do it you guys cover me  no its a suicide run  im the fastest  no you maggie and beth draw as many as you can over there  pop em through the fence  daryl go back to the other tower  carol youve become a pretty good shot  take your time we dont have a lot of ammo to waste  hershel you and carl take this tower  all right  ill run for the gate   come on  hey come here   come on  hey come here  come on hey come on  come on come on  sorry  hey come on over here  hey hey hey come on over here  he did it  light it up  fantastic   nice shooting  yeah  you okay   i havent felt this good in weeks  good  oh  oh  we havent had this much space since we left the farm  whoooo  mmm just like mom used to make  tomorrow well put all the bodies together  want to keep them away from that water  now if we can dig a canal under the fence  well have plenty of fresh water  the soil is good  we could plant some seed  grow some tomatoes cucumbers soybeans  thats his third time around  if there was any part of it compromised  hed have found it by now  thisll be a good place to have the baby  safe  its not much but if i dont bring you something  you wont eat at all  i guess little shane over there has got quite the appetite  dont be mean  ricks gotten us a lot farther  than i ever thought he would ill give him that  mmhmm  shane could never have done that  whats wrong  its that rifle the kickback  im just not used to it  hold on  better get back  its pretty romantic  want to screw around  pfft  ill go down first  even better  stop  bethy sing paddy reilly for me  i havent heard that i think  since your mother was alive  daddy not that one please  how about parting glass  no one wants to hear  why not  okay  of all the money   eer i had   i spent it in good company   and all the harm   eer ive ever done   alas it was to none but me   and all ive done   for want of wit   to memory now i cant recall   so fill to me   the parting glass   good night and joy be with you all   oh all the comrades   that eer i had   were sorry for my going away   and all the sweethearts  that eer i had   would wish me    one more day to stay    i had some  but since it falls unto my lot   that i should rise   and you should not   ill gently rise   and ill softly call   good night and joy   be with you all   good night and joy   be with you all   beautiful  better all turn in  ill take watch over there  got a big day tomorrow  what do you mean  look i know were all exhausted  this was a great win  but weve got to push just a little bit more  most of the walkers are dressed as guards and prisoners  looks like this place fell pretty early  it could mean the supplies may be intact  theyd have an infirmary  a commissary  an armory  that would be outside the prison itself  but not too far away  wardens offices would have info on the location  weapons food medicine  this place could be a gold mine  were dangerously low on ammo  wed run out before we make a dent  thats why we have to go in there  hand to hand  after all weve been through  we can handle it i know it  these assholes dont stand a chance  psst  i appreciate everything youre doing  and we all do  but its been a death march and theyre exhausted  can we just enjoy it for a few days  baby will be here in a few days  theres no time for a picnic  no but its time to get the house in order  what do you think im doing  youre absolute best  dont patronize me  im not  im just saying  the baby is about to be here   and we need to talk about  about what  things weve been avoiding  you want to talk talk to hershel  im doing stuff lori  things isnt that enough  im still here  youre right  im sorry  ready  daryl  come on  hey come on over here   come on  hey come on  we may need that  hey hey  almost there  i cant see them can you see them  back there  daryl  seen that  stop  well it looks secure  nothing will lead to that courtyard over there  and thats a civilian  so the interior could be over run by walkers from outside the prison  well if theres walls then what are we gonna do  we cant rebuild this whole place  we cant risk a blind spot  we have to push in  what do you think  home sweet home  for the time being  its secure  this cell block is  what about the rest of the prison  in the morning well find the cafeteria and infirmary  well sleep in the cells  i found keys on some guards  daryl has a set too  i aint sleeping in no cage  ill take the perch  come on  thank you  pretty gross  yeah remember the storage units  its actually its actually comfortable  check it out  you find your cell yet  yeah i was just making sure beth was safe   see you tomorrow  see you  im so exhausted i dont even care  here let me see  what you doing  checking for scratches  its late in the night    youre okay  late in the night   its quiet again   to fill up the space   to fill up the rooms on sunday afternoon   what are you doing out here  i needed some light  take this  how is it out there  same  its quiet  youre lying  we should go in a few days  theyre coming   you should go  no  ill hold you back go  i can take care of myself  i saved your ass all winter didnt i  i wont have you dying for me  good soldier wont leave your post  screw you  well go in a few days  if we stay  ill die here  not bad  flashbangs cs triplechasers  not sure how theyd work on walkers  but well take it  i aint wearing this shit  we could boil em  aint enough firewood in the whole forest no  besides we made it this far without em right   hershel  everything all right  yeah nothing to worry about  its the baby i think i lost it   you havent felt it move  nothing  and no braxtonhicks  at first i thought it was exhaustion or malnutrition  youre anemic  if were all infected then so is the baby  so what if its stillborn  what if its dead inside me right now   what if it rips me apart  stop  dont let your fear take control of you  okay then lets say it lives and i die during childbirth   thats not going to happen  why not  how many women died in childbirth before modern medicine  if i come back what if i attack it  or you or rick  or carl  if i do if there is any chance  you put me down immediately  you dont hesitate me the baby  if were walkers  you dont hesitate and you dont try to save us  okay  it might have been better if  if what  id never made it off the farm  youre exhausted frightened  yeah thats true  my son cant stand me  and my husband after what i put him through  weve all been carrying that weight  all winter  i tried to talk to him  he  hell come around  he hates me  hes too good a man to say it but i know  i put him and shane at odds i put that knife in his hand  you know who doesnt give a shit about that  this baby  now lets make sure everythings all right  you wont need that  i need you to stay put   youre kidding  we dont know whats in there  something goes wrong you could be the last man standing  i need you to handle things here  sure  great lets go  sorry   go back go back move  walkers  this way  come on this way  in here   wheres glenn and maggie  we have to go back  but which way  maggie glenn   rick  dad  daffy  mag  mag  no   no  maggie   daryl  oh
