have seen that  so why was daryl here  was he part of the assault  why why would he do that  he came for his friends  the other people you know  glenn and maggie  merle scooped them up on the run  was holding them to find out where his brother was  my my friends are still alive and were shooting at each other  youre trying to execute them  your friends killed six good people  crowley tim gargulio  eisenberg bob adams  haley  that man out there rich foster he makes seven  so thats what your friends did  why didnt you tell me they were here  you kept that from me while we were  youre just a visitor here  just passing through  so why should i tell you  dont do that  dont drive me out not now  what is it  the whole town is out on the street  it could get ugly again  take your sister inside  go on  you came through like always  sounds like we have a new problem on our hands   yeah  you get a good look at him  he had daryl and merle pitted against each other  a crowd cheering for them to fight to the death  what kind of a sick mind does that  the kind this world creates  whats wrong the baby  no the baby shes healthy  eats like a horse sleeps like a rock  so what is it  not exactly a chatterbox is he  be patient  when hes ready let me do the talking  she kind of has loris eyes  dont you think  everyone if i could  if i could have your attention   everyone  all right everybody shut

were never gonna be the same  ever  so what do we do  we dig deep and we find the strength to carry on  we work together and we rebuild  not just the fences  the gates the community  but ourselves  our hearts our minds  and years from now when they write about this plague  in the history books  they will write about woodbury   yeah they will  woodbury  we persevered   yeah  thank you  youve got a knack for that  just trying to do my part  sophia used to wake the neighbors  like clockwork  ed stayed at a friends most nights till she calmed down  i always wanted a child  she wouldnt have made it if daryl hadnt been here  he couldnt stand to lose anyone else  sounds like him  i dont see why he had to leave  merle sounds like a jerk  men like merle get into your head  make you feel like you deserve the abuse  even for daryl  im hardly the woman i was a year ago  but if ed walked through that door right now  breathing and told me to go with him  id like to think id tell him to go to hell
