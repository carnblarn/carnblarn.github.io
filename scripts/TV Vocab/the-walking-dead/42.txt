like your brother always doing the right thing  even at the cost of their own people  go on have a cigarette  i quit  yeah me too  i remember the first smoke i ever had  me and my brother huddled in the garage  puffing on one of my dads lucky strikes  he must have smelled the smoke because he came barging in  looking to beat up on us  but my brother got between us  said he stole them  wasnt true it was me  but that was my brother  hero  he got two black eyes and a broken rib for that  and i got beat anyway  take one  im running things now  and i will do everything it takes to protect this camp  now if you join me i promise you  you will never have to worry about whether you were doing  the right thing or the wrong thing  because we will do  the only thing  mitch what are we gonna tell the camp about pete  governor well tell them he died on a supply run  saving our asses  mitch you think theyre really gonna believe it  governor people believe what they want to believe  everybody loves a hero   chatter   governor hows the perimeter coming  alicia its good we got cars ringing almost the entire camp  i think a few more runs we should have ourselves a nice little buffer   governor and the pits  they keep coming we keep burning them  i dont know if its the heat or what  but there have been a hell of a lot more of them lately   and the armory  solid  i rounded up all the ammo in camp  were officially stocked in the bullet department  still tell your crews  supply runs are arrow only from now on  gunshots are a luxury  sooner or later were gonna need em  thats right and not just for the biters  mitch and i and pete  we saw what people can do out there  you come across strangers you just avoid them  come back here and tell us where you saw them okay  lets go   whispering    sighs   maybe we can find a better place  you know if  were willing to fight for it  we dont need to find a better place  this is home  youre it aunt tara  what i cant be it im on guard
