                previously on amcs the walking dead  they found wells they got him they found him  i found you too  i dont trust him  have you ever trusted anybody  hed be dead if it werent for you  i thought maybe you were coming out here to talk about us  youve seen my brother  not for a long time  makes two of us  so whats your real name  i never tell  youre just gonna leave us in here  from now on this part of the prison is yours  consider yourselves the lucky ones   footsteps    liquid sloshing    clattering    theme music playing    okay lets get the other car in   well park em in the west entry of the yard  good our vehicles camped out  there look like a giant vacancy sign  rick after that we need to load up these corpses  so we can burn em  tdog gonna be a long day  wheres glenn and maggie we could use some help  up in the guard tower  guard tower  they were just up there last night  glenn maggie   door clicks   hey whats up guys   laughs    you coming  what   all chuckle  daryl you comin  daryl come on we could use a hand  yeah well be right down  sickos  hey rick  come with me  rick thats close enough   we had an agreement  please mister we know that  we made a deal  but youve gotta understand  we cant live in that place another minute  you follow me all the bodies  people we knew   blood brains everywhere theres ghosts  why dont you move the bodies out   tdog you should be burning them  axel we tried   we did  the fence is down on the far side of the prison  every time we drag a body out those things just line up  so hump in a body and just running back inside  look we had nothing to do with thomas and andrew  nothing  you trying to prove a point you proved it bro  well do whatever it takes to be part of your group  just please please  dont make us live in that place  our deal is not negotiable  you either live in your cell block or you leave   sighs  i told you this was a waste of time  they aint no different than the pricks who shot up our boys  you know how many friends corpses  we had to drag out this week  just threw em out like  humph these were good guys  good guys who had our backs against the really bad dudes in the joint  like thomas and andrew  weve all made mistakes to get in here chief  and im not gonna pretend to be a saint  but believe me  weve paid our due  enough that we would rather hit that road  than to go back into that shithole  cmon dude  rick are you serious  you want them living in a cell next to you  theyll just be waiting for a chance to grab our weapons  you want to go back to sleeping with one eye open  i never stopped  bring them into the fold  if we send them off packing we might as well execute them ourselves  i dont know axel seems a little unstable  carol after all weve been through  we fought so hard for all this  what if they decide to take it  its just been us for so long  theyre strangers i dont  it feels weird all of a sudden to have these other people around  you brought us in  yeah but you turned up with a shot boy in your arms   didnt give us a choice  they cant even kill walkers  theyre convicts bottom line  those two might actually have less blood on their hands than we do  i get guys like this  hell i grew up with them  theyre degenerates but they aint psychos  i could have been with them just as easy as i am out here with you guys   so are you with me  hell no  let em take their chances out on the road   just like we did  what im saying daryl  when i was a rookie i arrested this kid  wanted for stabbing his girlfriend  the kid blubbered like a baby  during the interrogation during the trial  suckered the jury  he was acquitted due to insufficient evidence and in 2 weeks later  shot another girl  weve been through too much  our deal with them stands   truck engine revving faint digging    people chatting   pretty amazing  if we had more ammo we could cut down a whole pack of biters  i hear you and andrea are leaving today  thats a shame  we could use a soldier like you  you seem like youre holding your own  even the national guard was overrun  no amount of training can prepare you for the world today  youd think one soldier would drive away  especially against something so slow  those men were heroes  not the kind to leave anyone behind  if only wed gotten there sooner  and you were with us  lots of bullet holes  you think biters figured out how to use weapons  they must have encountered bandits weeks ago  its ugly out there but then  you know that better than anyone  its too bad what happened to wells  it is  dr stevens couldnt revive him  merle put a bullet in his brain  no funeral  we cremated him quietly  these people have been through so much  i figured thank god at least no one knew him  thank god   crackling   rick move the cars to the upper yard  point them facing out  theyll be out of the way but ready to go if we ever need to bail  well get the prisoners  a weeks worth of supplies for the road  it might not last a week  its their choice   did they really have one  hey hey  whose blood would you rather have on your hands  maggies glenns or theirs  neither  car engine starts   twin cylinder is that a triumph  dont even look at it  didnt want it bored out  motor revs   sounds like it could use a tuneup im pretty handy with the grind  heads are leakin i know my bikes  man will you just stop  have some balls  just sayin   creaking   all right  just take your time  daddy dont push yourself   chuckles  what else am i going to do  i cant stand looking up at the bottom of that bunk  whoa   tapping   you know  i can go pretty steady  thats a good start  want to take a rest  rest  chuckles  lets go for a little stroll  if we leave soon  well got a few hours on the road before dusk  where are we heading  im thinking the coast  we have the water completely on one side  maybe we find a boat  best thing we can do is find an island  and if the coast isnt safe  keep moving  then what do we do just grow old  live off the sea by ourselves  id rather take my chances out there than stay here  because your gut tells you theres something off about this place  about the governor  its kept us alive this long  thats true  theres enough food in there to last you guys a week  cut you loose when we get back  thank you bro  sit tight  oscar thank you bro   engine starts    glenn should i take her out  rick no  if that armory hadnt been picked clean we could spare the ammo  ill start making runs the sooner the better  well throw as much wood as we can in the dog run  wont the fire attract more walkers  maybe we should bury them  were behind the fence  its worth the onetime risk to get rid of the bodies for good  i dont want to be planting crops in walkerrotted soil  i got you here if you need it  just take your time on these steps  carl ooh ooh  hershel you cleared all those bodies out  its starting to look like a place we could really live in  hey you watch your step  last thing we need is you falling  looky here  he is one tough son of a bitch   chuckles    all right hershel  shh  keep your cheers down   growling   oh man cant we just have one good day  youre doing great daddy  ready to race hershel  give me another day  ill take you on  carl chuckles   grab the rest of the bodies  chuckles    growling  walkers look out  no   walkers snarling    gunfire   rick get out  get

way  daryl come on come on  axel hey bro what about us   growls    screams   no  hurry   i circled where you can find that farm i was staying at with daryl  ah you were right off route 9  right before it becomes dahlonega highway  and youre saying that the farm  is only about a days walk from there  give or take  this is where we looked for sophia  even made it up around here  how come we never hooked up  you called me a whore  and a rugmuncher   chuckles  got a way with words dont i   yeah  mmm  why are you doing this  id want the same thing if it was my family out there   sure you dont

got something in common blondie  we got left behind by the same people  and saved by another  have you ever thought about leaving this place   sighs   never had a reason to  so the governor is a good man  let me just put it this way  i wasnt in the best of shape when he found me  he should have just kept on going  yeah hes a good man  lets go pull it   snarling    what the hell happened  beth the

one controls a certain part of the prison  the hatch shut them all off when the prison was overrun  can someone open up the main gates electronically   with full power  i only went in a few days  i guess it might be possible   come with us  glenn lets go  theres a set of double doors  that will lead to a corridor  that will get you back to our cell block   no you should stop  im getting you
