maybe you and every other pair of boobs on this planet  just figured out that the light switch  see goes both ways  maybe we wouldnt have so much global warming   you say that  yeah  anyway uh  polite version  still man that that earns me this  this look and loathing you would not believe  and thats when the exorcist voice pops out  you sound just like my damn father  always always yelling about the power bill  telling me to turn off the damn lights   what do you say to that  you know what i wanna say  i wanna say bitch you mean to tell me youve been hearing this your entire life  and you are still too damn stupid to learn how to turn off a switch  you know  i dont actually say that tho   that would be bad  yeah go with the uh  the polite version there   very wise  yes sir  so hows it with
