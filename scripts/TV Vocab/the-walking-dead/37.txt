pleurisy aspiration  choked to death on his own blood  caused those trails down his face  ive seen them before  on a walker outside the fences  i saw them on patrick too  theyre from the internal lung pressure building up  like if you shake a soda can and pop the top  only imagine your eyes  ears nose and throat are the top  its a sickness from the walkers  no these things happened before they were around  could be pneumococcal  most likely an aggressive flu strain  someone locked him in just in time  no man charlie used to sleepwalk  locked himself in hell he was just eating barbecue yesterday  how could somebody die in a day just from a cold  i had a sick pig it died quick  saw a sick boar in the woods  pigs and birds thats how these things spread in the past  we need to do something about those hogs  maybe we got lucky maybe these two cases are it  havent seen anybody be lucky in a long time  bugs like to run through close quarters  doesnt get any closer than this  all of us in here weve all been exposed  dad  we have to go get dr s  honey hes been bit  the doctor wont help  you take care of your sister  dad  dad   dad  no   come on its time  no  you know what i have to do  what

they came out and helped me  are you all right  what happened in there  patrick got sick last night  its some kind of flu it moves fast  we think he died and attacked the cell block  look i know he was your friend and im sorry  he was a good kid  we lost a lot of good people  glenn and your dad are okay but they were in there  you shouldnt get too close to anyone that might have been exposed  at least for a little while  carl all of you  patrick was fine yesterday  and he died overnight  two people died that quick  well have to separate everyone thats been exposed  thats everyone in that cell block  thats all of us maybe more  we know that this sickness can be lethal  we dont know how easily it spreads  is anyone else showing symptoms that we know of  we cant just wait and see and theres children  it isnt just the illness  if people die they become a threat  we need a place for them to go  they cant stay in d  we cant risk going in there to clean it up  we can use cell block a  death row  im not sure thats much of an upgrade  its clean thats an upgrade  think thatll work for dr s  ill help caleb get it set up   you okay  mmhmm  you sure you dont sound so good  were just taking her back to my cell so she can rest  tyreese i dont think thats a good idea  why whats going on now  we think its a flu or something  thats how patrick died  judith was in that cell block  shes vulnerable  anyone that may be sick  or even exposed should stay away   it killed patrick  shes gonna be okay  now that we know what patrick died from we can treat it right  dont panic were going to figure this out  but we should keep you separated in the meantime  well have caleb take a look at you  ill see what we have in the way of medications  david from the decatur group  hes been coughing too  ill get him  theres some empty clean cells in the tombs right   yeah well meet you there  okay  come on  lets get you settled  have to call another meeting later  all right  ill get to burying the dead ones  you wear gloves and a mask  uhhuh  you all right  im worried about lizzie and mica they were around patrick  we all were  karen and david are gonna be separated till they feel better  youre right are you okay  mmhmm got to be  gonna bury your dad  you can visit bring him flowers  lizzie were gonna have to talk about what happened in there  your daddy asked me to protect you  like youre my own and i will  its time someone told you the truth  honey youre weak  you lost your nerve  you have to trust your gut and you have to act fast every time  thats life and death  hes dead  i know and im sorry  but if you want to live you have to become strong  hes dead hes dead  he was special and now hes dead  whyd they kill him whyd they kill nick  youre so stupid  nick  shes messed up  shes not weak  glad you were in there  wasnt much use without my gun  no you were  all this time youve been taking off  you earned it  we wouldnt be here without you  it was all of us  no it was you first  you gonna help us figure this out  i screwed up too many times  those calls you got to make i start down that road  i almost lost my boy who he was  whatever else this place needs im here for it  like i said you earned it  but for what its worth you see mistakes  i see when the shit hits  youre standing there with a shovel  rick daryl  oh shit  the noise drew em out and now this parts starting to give  did you see anything  they just started taking out the dead  i dont need to know who yet  i dont want to  im glad you came back safe  it was stupid  i was so stupid  when i fell on my ass they should have just left me out there  now thats stupid  we care about you  they could have gotten hurt  when you care about people  hurt is kind of part of the package  were there any kids  got all these widows and orphans  but what do you call someone who lost a child  youd think someone would have given that a name  are you okay  does she always cry like that  i think she senses peoples moods  dont  were supposed to stay away from each other  are you seeing this  is someone feeding these things   heads up  this part of the fence now  hold on hold on hey hey hey  its gonna give its gonna give  everybody back come on back now  the fence keeps bending in like that those walkers are coming over it  daryl get the truck  i know what to do  you know if patrick was catholic  he said he was a practicing atheist  did you tell your dad what you saw in the library yesterday  nope  are you going to tell him  i have to keep teaching those kids to survive  you know that  did you tell their parents  no  are you gonna tell them  if i do maybe after this theyll understand  but maybe they wont i dont want to take that risk  thats between you and them  no  its between you and me  if you tell your dad hell tell them  and like i said maybe theyll understand maybe they wont  i dont want to lie to my dad  im not asking you to lie  im asking you not to say anything    lying in my bed at night      i dont want to grow up      nothing ever seems to turn out right      i dont want to grow up      how do you live in a world of fog      its always changing things      makes me wish that i could be a dog      oh when i see the price you pay      i dont want to grow up      nothing ever seems to go my way      i dont want to grow up      only thing to live for is today    some lullaby  i just sing her what i like  i figure its better than ashes  or cradles falling out of trees  oh shoot can you hold her a second   please im covered in carrots  no  thanks  ready  lets go  go  all right hold up  all right go go  lizzie those are walkers  nick was a walker  you dont feel bad about that walker dying  you feel bad about your dad  you loved him and hes gone  yeah  there  not this time  think the pigs made them sick  or we made the pigs sick  i think we should stay away from judy a while   just in case  okay   i dont like it but  we have to protect her  yes we do   hey dad  yeah  carols been teaching the kids  how to use weapons  how to kill  their parents dont know  and she doesnt want you to know  i think you should let her  i know youre gonna say its not up to you  but it can be  dad  thank you for telling me  yeah  i wont stop her  i wont say anything  carl
