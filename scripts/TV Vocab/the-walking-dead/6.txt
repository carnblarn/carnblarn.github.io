questions first thing  but you will anyway  we didnt come here for the eggs  give me playback of ts19  playback of ts19  few people ever got a chance to see this  very few   is that a brain   an extraordinary one  not that it matters in the end  take us in for eiv  enhanced internal view  what are those lights  its a persons life  experiences memories  its everything  somewhere in all that organic wiring  all those ripples of light  is you  the thing that makes you unique  and human  you dont make sense ever  those are synapses  electric impulses in the brain  that carry all the messages  they determine everything a person says  does or thinks from the moment of birth  to the moment of death  death thats what this is a vigil  yes  or rather the playback of the vigil  this person died  who  test subject 19  someone who was bitten and infected  and volunteered to have us record the process  vi scan forward to the first event  scanning to first event   what is that  it invades the brain like meningitis  the adrenal glands hemorrhage  the brian goes into shutdown  then the major organs  then death  everything you ever were or ever will be  gone  is that what happened to jim  yes  she lost somebody two days ago  her sister  i lost somebody too  i know how devastating it is  scan to the second event  scanning to second event  the resurrection times vary wildly  we had reports of it happening in as little as three minutes  the longest we heard of was eight hours  in the case of this patient  it was two hours one minute  seven seconds   it restarts the brain   no just the brain stem  basically it gets them up and moving  but theyre not alive  you tell me  its nothing like before  most of that brain is dark  dark lifeless dead  the frontal lobe the neocortex  the human part that doesnt come back  the you part  just a shell driven by mindless instinct  god what was that  he shot his patient in the head  didnt you  vi power down the main screen and the workstations  powering down main screen and workstations  you have no idea what it is do you  it could be microbial viral parasitic fungal  or the wrath of god  there is that  somebody must know something  somebody somewhere  there are others right other facilities  there may be some  people like me  but you dont know how can you not know  everything went down  communications directives all of it  ive been in the dark for almost a month  so its not just here  theres nothing left anywhere nothing  thats what youre really saying right  jesus  man im gonna get soon faced drunk again  dr jenner i know this has been taxing for you  and i hate to ask one more question but  that clock  its counting down  what happens at zero  the basement generators they run out of fuel  and then  vi what happens when the power runs out  when the power runs out  facilitywide decontamination will occur  decontamination what does that mean  i dont like the way jenner clammed up  the way he just wandered off like that  whats wrong with him seriously man  is he nuts medicated what  in there  check that way  shane  its empty   emergency lighting on  what the hell is this  hey you guys kill the lights   nah it just went ou  anything  yeah a lot of dead generators  and more empty fuel drums than i can count  it cant be down to just that one  mom something wrong  nothing its just  the air conditioning stopped  i did the best i could in the time that i had  i hope youd be proud of that  we always think theres gonna be more time  then it runs out  why is the air off   and the lights in our room  whats going on  why is everything turned off  energy use is being prioritized  air isnt a priority and lights  its not up to me zone 5 is shutting itself down  hey hey what the hell does that mean  hey man im talking to you  what do you mean its shutting itself down  how can a building do anything   youd be surprised  rick  jenner whats happening  the system is dropping all the nonessential uses of power  its designed to keep the  computers running to the last possible second  that started as we approached the halfhour mark  right on schedule   it was the french  what  they were the last ones to hold out as far as i know  while our people were bolting out the doors  and committing suicide in the hallways  they stayed in the labs till the end  they thought they were close to a solution  what happened  the same thing thats happening here  no power grid  ran out of juice  the world runs on fossil fuel  i mean how stupid is that   let me tell you  to hell with it shane i dont even care  lori grab our things everybody get your stuff  were getting out of here now  oh okay  whats that  whats that   doc whats going on here  everybody yall heard rick  get your stuff and

things  thats not something i control the computers do  i told you once that front door closed  it wouldnt open again you heard me say that   its better this way  what is  what happens in 28 minutes   what happens in 28 minutes  come on  you know what this place is  we protected the public  from very nasty stuff  weaponized smallpox  ebola strains that could wipe out half the country  stuff you dont want getting out ever  in the event of a catastrophic power failure  in a terrorist attack for example  hits are deployed to prevent any organisms from getting out  hit hits   vi define  hits  highimpulse thermobaric fuelair explosives  cocoists of a twostage aerosol ignition  that produces a blast wave of significantly greater power  and duration than any other known explosive except nuclear  the vacuumpressure effect ignites the oxygen  between 5000 and 6000 degrees  and is used when the greatest loss of life  and damage to structures is desired  it sets the air on fire  no pain  an end to sorrow grief  regret  everything  open the damn door  out of my way  daryl  you shouldve left well enough alone   it wouldve been so much easier  easier for who  all of you you know whats
