him a canteen take him out to the main road send him on his way   he knows where we are  hes not a threat  james thinks im his he thinks the baby is his he is dangerous   i thought we were going further  we are   so why are we stopping  i wanted to talk  been waiting a week till we were gonna do this   i just wanna talk  we dont need to  we do  no man we dont  were doing this i get it  he was passed out when yall brought him back  doesnt know where the farm is  that isnt what i need to talk to you about  i heard  what really happened at the school  was it to survive  yeah  one of us wasnt gonna make it out  it had to be him  one shot to the leg carl lives  reality is  he had no business being here  there whatever  you dont think i wouldve done it  no man i know you wouldnt have  you dont think i can keep lori or carl safe  i didnt say that  or my baby  is it gonna have to be me too  rick you cant just be the good guy and expect to live  okay not anymore  im not the good guy anymore  to save carls life  i wouldve done anything anything  now lori says youre dangerous  but youre not gonna be dangerous  not to us not to me not anymore  how about you look at me  you and lori  i get what happened  when i figured it out and i figured it out pretty quickly  i wanted to break your jaw  let you choke on your teeth  but i didnt  that wasnt weakness  it took everything  that is my wife that is my son  that is my unborn child  i will stay alive to keep them alive  you dont love her  you think you do but you dont  now the only way you and me keep on  is that you accept everything i just said  right here right now  and we move forward with that understanding  when it started it was just  it was a couple of weird stories on the news  then then it was so quick  everything it just happened  two weeks later im in the hospital  and there were soldiers shooting people in the halls  they were shooting people man not walkers  then the walkers came through  you know i tried to get you out  i tried but we werent gonna make it  man there was no way and i knew it  but i couldnt live with it  i couldnt live knowing  but i had to  i didnt keep lori and carl alive man  they kept me alive  i want you to know that i didnt look at her before that  brother if i could take it all back i would  i wanna check the ropes  its all good  rick say anything to you about glenn when they got back from town  just that it had gotten pretty bad  hes not the same  says he froze  blames me says i got inside his head  he came back thats what matters  men have to do certain things you know that  and theyre either gonna blame the little woman  as the reason they do em or the reason they dont  ill tell you something what happens out there happens out there  and we  were just trying to keep it together till they get back   things were good maybe i  glenns a big boy  he makes his own choices and then you  do you have anything to apologize for  tell him to man up and pull himself together  just dont say man up  it never goes well  let me just get this to beth  you go on i got it  weve gotta start using our knives more  if theres one walker we use our knives  we keep things quiet we save ammunition  yeah  we need dry goods ahead of the winter  warm clothes fuel  maybe we get a break  you gotta think the cold affects them  if it doesnt kill em its gotta slow em down  the second week of january last year  we got all that snow and ice  my cousin got stuck on 85 for 24 hours  sitting in his car with a birthday cake  for his girlfriend at georgia tech  he just sat and ate birthday cake  and listened to the lord of the rings book on tape  we get lucky we get the same winter as last year  by december its a different world  safer  maybe we find some snowmobiles to make runs  that sounds good  knock knock  how about this you uh  you eat up all your food  well get you up and out of here and go take a walk  what do you say  itll do good to be outside  youre pregnant  how could you do that  uh i dont really have a choice  you think itll make a difference  of course it will  you eat something  its more than 18  yeah im looking for a place  a place for what  give him a fair shake a shot  there  thisll do  well leave the boy here and scavenge some supplies  over there  wait  like i said  guns quick easy  but other ways to do this  one more

bring him back to where lori sleeps  to where carl sleeps  hell be locked up in the barn   unless you bust it open  oh dont start that shit   im taking the night  man you take that  you think on it rick keep struggling with it  it aint hard man  the right choice is the one that keeps us alive  its always the same with you  its like the first moment its whenever youre put to the test  stop acting

worry  you are being so selfish  this couldve been handled better  how so  you shouldnt have taken the knife away   excuse me  you were wrong  like dale taking my gun that wasnt your decision  she has to choose to live on her own  she has to find her own reasons  want me to tie a noose for her  if shes serious shell figure out a way  doesnt mean i cant stop her  or let her know that i care  that has nothing to do with it lori  she only has so many choices in front of her  and she believes the best one is suicide   thats not an option  of course it is  she doesnt need to be yelled at or treated like a child  she needs a loaded gun right  youll understand if i dont send you in there  i came through it  and became such a productive member of the group  let maggie handle this her way  i contribute  i help keep this place safe  the men can handle this on their own  they dont need your help  im sorry what would you have me do  oh theres plenty of work to go around  are you serious  everything falls apart  youre in my face over skipping laundry  puts a burden on the rest of us  on me and carol and patricia and maggie  cooking cleaning and caring for beth  and you you dont care about anyone  but yourself you sit up on that rv  working on your tan with a shotgun in your lap  no i am on watch against walkers  that is what matters  not fresh mint leaves in the lemonade  and we are providing stability  we are trying to create a life worth living  are you kidding me  look i went after rick i took down two walkers   after crashing maggies car  dont act like youre  the only one who can take care of herself  ever apologize for that  crashing her   youre insane  no you are  and youre the one thats selfcentered  the way you take it all for granted  my husband is out there  for the hundredth time  my son was shot  dont you dare tell me i take this for granted  you dont get it do you  your husband came back from the dead  your son too and now youve got a baby on the way  the rest of us have piled up our losses  me carol beth but you just keep on keeping on   we have all suffered  playing house acting like the queen bee  laying down rules for everybody but yourself  you know what go ahead  go in there and tell that little girl  that everythings gonna be okay  just like it is for you  shell get a husband a son baby boyfriend  she just has to look on the bright side  mom would be ashamed  to learn she raised such a coward   what about dad beth  hes clueless   he had us waiting for a cure  he knows he was wrong  when has dad ever admitted he was wrong  hes just telling ricks group what they want to hear  and jimmy  we went out for three months and now im married to him  and me  you could do that to me  i cant take another funeral  you cant avoid it  what are we waiting for   we should both do it  what  at the same time help each other   no  its hard to do it   no one wants to but  no please dont   we can do it so its peaceful easy  stop talking like that  our choice and then it would be over  or well be forced to do it when the farm and this house is overrun   no one can protect us  thats not true  who glenn  i heard what happened  rick will save his family  the others too  were alone  you me patricia  with only dad and jimmy against a whole world of those things  i dont wanna be gutted  i wanna go  in this bed tonight  with you beside me  please
