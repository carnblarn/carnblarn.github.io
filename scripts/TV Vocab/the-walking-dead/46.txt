  i gotta go  it seems like neither one of yous  been paying close enough attention to the hell on earth weve been living in  so let me tell you how to best avoid winding up just another deadalive prick  you find some strong likeminded comrades  and you stay stuck together like wet on water  we need people  the more the better we need each other partner  even with all that gear on your shoulder you wont last a night  not by yourself  ill take my chances  im gonna have to insist  that you hold the hell up  all right believe it or not  the fate of the entire damn human race  might depend on it  what the hell are you talking about  who is this guy  im sergeant abraham ford  and these are my companions rosita espinosa  and dr eugene porter  were on a mission to get eugene to washington dc  eugenes a scientist  and he knows exactly what caused this mess  all right  so what happened  its classified  hed been talking to the mucketymucks in washington  on his satellite phone  the past couple weeks  nobodys been picking up on the other end  we saw how you handled those corpses back there  we could use your help  sorry  i had to get us off that road  you were passed out we were out of bullets  i know how to get back to that bus  i wrote down every turn  i will get you back if i can okay  thats where shed go to find me   thats where im gonna go  its a waste of time  tara told us what went down  there is zero chance you will ever find your wife again  alive or dead  mainly because sorry to tell you  shes gone  no need for you to die too  now come on  get back in the truck do something with your life  when the people we love kick  well they disappear  doesnt mean youve got to go out that way too  shes alive and im gonna find her  you son of a bitch   hey hey hey  abraham

  where the hell is tony  tony  get him the hell up  we were running a convoy in one of these  coming up a dune theres this camel  looks like its about to puke  probably because shitbirds packed  about four pounds of c4 up its ass  we were within 20 feet of that blast  that sent that animals hump half a klick into the desert  and we drove home  so you tell me how in the holy hell  did you possibly kill this truck  a fully ampedup state  and an ignorance of rapidfiring weapons  is this yours  sorry about your ride  hope you guys make it to washington  wait for me  what the hell else are

her  son of bitch  kill her kill her  go go  got to hand it to him  hes a persistent son of a bitch  i get why youre following him  youre loyal  youre a good person  i like it  but what were doing  i dont know how else to say it  saving the world is just  is just more important  i mean even if he does find his wife  so what  how long do you think theyll live happily ever after  if we dont get eugene up to washington  you think because im following glenn that makes me a good person  im not  youre good  you dont know anything about me  just like i dont know anything about why youre going to washington  i get why eugenes going  hes the only one that knows how to end this  and rosita she loves you shed follow you anywhere  but why the hell you agreed to drive him halfway across the country  is that hard to believe i want to save the world  because youre a good person  you dont have to tell me why  just dont lie to me  crazy cheese  what do you think  lets go  lets go
