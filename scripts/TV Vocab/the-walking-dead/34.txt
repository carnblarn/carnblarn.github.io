destruction  that wasteth at noonday  1000 shall fall at thy side  and 10000 at thy right hand  but it shall not come nigh thee  only with thine eyes  shalt thou behold  and see the reward of the wicked  surely he shall deliver thee  from the snare of the fowler  and from the noisome pestilence  youre not there  shes not there  he shall cover thee  and under his wings shalt thou trust  there shall no evil befall thee  neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling  you okay  what i wouldnt do  to keep you two safe  rick  what youre about to do  i cant  i wont   so where is it  around the corner  we got to clear some walkers  then get the others down here to barricade it  a breach like this could be an open invitation to the governor  hes not much for subtlety  you want to take your chances  governor made rick an offer  turn you over and we all give peace a chance  i agree with you he would have blinked  but not you  im being straight with you  you were straight when you led me into the tombs  okay maybe i wasnt straight  you put a bag over my head  i got it done  he wouldnt  keep moving  he was a guy that came back for me on that rooftop  nah  its all on me  you know  i figure thats why i was back there in the first place  do the dirty work  may i  ill take that as a yes  oh  you know what id figured you would have run  wanted my sword back before i get away  it may go down that way  but if i were you  i wouldnt get my hopes up  move  its off well take our chances  im not saying it was the wrong call  but this is definitely the right one  whats wrong  i cant find merle or michonne  theyve gone  come on  he was in here  said he was looking for drugs  said a lot of things actually  like what  said that you were gonna change your mind here we go  yeah he took her here they mixed it up  damn it im going after him   you cant track for shit  then the both of us  no just me  i said id go and ill go  plus theyre gonna come back here  you need to be ready  your family too  i want to be with my brother  my brother he wants to be in the prison  this little trip  maybe itll keep that place standing  if i pull it off maybe all is forgiven  thats a whole lot of maybes  you got to play the hand youre dealt  i only got one  you talk about the weight  of what you have to do  how you can handle it  a bad man  someone truly evil  theyre light as a feather  they dont feel a thing  ive killed 16 men since all this went down  lets go  look at what that bastards done  look at us  hes one man  therell be others like him  there always have been  i know its like the walkers  theres nothing we can do  when you gave me this  i didnt fully understand what it meant  such a simple thing  i know what it means now  i know what it takes  i want to marry maggie  and we dont have to have a wedding  i dont even know if well last the week  but i want her to know  before  who knows  you have my blessing  thank you  all right  i think were good  yeah were great  come on  yeah  thats the deal  oh shit  merle  come on merle  merle  okay okay  ah  come on  lets go  so is this your thing then you take out the trash  dont be so hard on yourself darlin  the governor rick  anyone who needs their piss bucket emptied  and you come arunning  things are different for your brother  yeah they are  rick says jump and he wants to know how high  mmmmm rick needs him  respects him  he didnt ask him to do this little job now did he  no cause he wants it done  you keep telling yourself that  the truth is this could have been your shot  with your skills a whole new beginning  but you choose to stay on the outside  no ones gonna mourn you  not even daryl  hes got a new family  you keep trying to get under my skin  im gonna cut that tongue out  your buddys turning you over  cause hes trying to save his own ass  youre as much on the outside as i am girl  maybe  but once the governors done with me  at least i wont have to live with myself  you said you killed 16 men since this thing started  you ever kill anyone before  no  and how about before woodbury  before you met him  huh  so he saves your life  cleans you up  fed you a line of bullshit  why would you kill somebody else for him  you know we can go back  aint happening  both of us  we can just go back  i cant go back  dont you understand that  i cant  why  you go back with them  get ready for whats next  i got something i got to do on my own  hey  wheres my brother  you kill him  he let me go  dont let anyone come after me  wheres it coming from  come on come on with me  well have to spread out  you two with me  walkers  all over  hey over there  you leave him to me  i aint gonna beg  i aint begging you  no   hey  hey  carl was looking for you  he found me  i think we should head over rick has something to say  uh just  one more thing before that  here  yes  when i met with the governor  he offered me a deal  he said  he said he would leave us alone  if i gave him michonne  and i was gonna do that  to keep us safe  i changed my mind  but now merle took michonne to fulfill the deal  and daryl went to stop him  and i dont know if its too late  i was wrong not to tell you  and im sorry  what i said last year  that first night  after the farm  it cant be like that  it cant  what we do what were willing to do  who we are its not my call  it cant be  i couldnt sacrifice one of us for the greater good  because we are the greater good  were the reason were still here  not me  this is life and death  how you live  how you die  it isnt up to me  im not your governor  we choose to go  we choose to stay  we stick together  we vote  we can stay and we can fight  or we can go  no
