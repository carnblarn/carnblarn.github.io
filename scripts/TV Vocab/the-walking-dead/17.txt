group  oh man i dont need my head shrunk  this groups broken  im better off fending for myself   you act like you dont care  yeah its cause i dont  so live or die you dont care what happens to randall   nope  then why not stand with me  try to save the kids life if it really doesnt matter one way or the other  didnt peg you for a desperate son of a bitch  your opinion makes a difference  man aint nobody looking at me for nothing  carol is and i am right now  and you obviously you have ricks ear  rick just looks to shane let him  you cared about what happened to sofia  cared what it meant to the group  torturing people that isnt you  youre a decent man  so is rick  shane hes different  whys that cause he killed otis   he tell you that  he told some story  how otis covered him saved his ass  he showed up with the dead guys gun  rick aint stupid  if he didnt figure that out its cause he didnt wanna  its like i said groups broken  baby wheres your daddy   hes up there  all right  so uh  the nights are getting colder and were pretty exposed   i was thinking  maybe we could clear this place out  station lookouts up here   uh  or we could talk to hershel  about staying in the house   yeah  all right  is that really the best way to do this  to string him up  i have no idea  its my first time  look i know how you feel about the death penalty but  and i know the world has changed  after everything thats happened  you and shane agree on this  so you support this decision  if you think its best  you never did tell me what happened on the road with you and shane  he wont be a problem anymore  you know well see sophia again in heaven some day  shes in a better place  no shes not  heaven is just another lie  and if you believe it youre an idiot  you need to control that boy  carl what happened  hes disrespectful   did he say something  something cruel about sofia   well figure it out its okay i  its not okay  ill have ill have a talk with him  see well well  well deal with it if you can calm down so that i can   dont tell me to calm down  no i i dont  i dont need you to patronize me everyone either avoids me  or they treat me like im crazy  i lost my daughter i didnt lose my mind  carl come over here  did you talk back to carol   no  she says you did  you cant talk back to people like that  i said its stupid to believe in heaven  cause it is  well just think about that for a minute  she just lost her daughter  she wants to believe shes still alive in some way   but she  dont  dont talk think  its a good rule of thumb for life  mom always wants you to talk more  dont change the subject  you owe carol an apology  you made a mistake fix it  is that why youre gonna kill that guy  fixing your mistake  thats different  how are you gonna do it are you gonna hang him in the barn  you just think about how youre gonna make things right with carol  dont talk think   you got it  yeah   what happened  a dozen steer busted through the fence  been wrangling the runaways all morning  but youre not here to talk cattle   the boy  the prisoner   randall  i dont want to know  im told theyre deciding his fate  ill leave it with rick  but this is your home  i want him away from my girls  i dont care how   its an execution  i dont want to know  but you cant stand by the sidelines  youre a man with convictions you  to tell you the truth i was  or at least i thought i was  but ive made too many mistakes  would you at least talk with randall before making up your mind  no ill leave it with rick  whats up dale  i wanna change your mind  what you serious  i know you and i will never see eye to eye on much  say thats the understatement of the year huh  but uh   youre not going anywhere  nope   and im not going anywhere  okay  so lets talk about this like men  okay  you deny were in danger dale  no but theres a dozen of us  one of him   theres 30 of them  killing him doesnt change that   no  but it changes us  you  you got balls dale  im gonna give you that  now  ill tell you what in a little bit when yall gather  youre gonna talk about this  if youve convinced them to keep this guy alive  then i aint gonna say a damn word about it okay  but im telling you now man to man  youre wrong  and when this guy kills somebody  i aint gonna need to say anything  because that blood thats gonna be on you  youre wrong about this dale youre dead wrong  doodlebug doodlebug go away home   doodlebug  doodlebug doodlebug go away home   how is she  she seems to be in good spirits today  arent you doodlebug  well let me know if i can do anything  wheres your family from  michigan  but uh before that korea  immigrants built this country  never forget that  our family came from ireland  maggie greene i kinda figured  my grandfather brought this over from the old country  he passed it on to my father who passed it on to me  i pawned it to pay for a night of drinking i no longer remember  you bought it back  my late wife did josephine  maggies mother  she gave it back years later  when i sobered up  she was a good woman my jo  maggies a lot like her  when we were in that bar and afterwards  i thought about a lot of things  you become a father someday youll understand  no man is good enough for your little girl  until one is  go on now before i change my mind about you  thanks  its almost time  i know this isnt easy for you  it isnt easy for anyone  but i thought it through  i made the call  im ready to do this  you dont have to be the one to do it   shane daryl  yeah it has to be me  i brought him back here maybe i shouldnt have  i gotta keep these people safe  that is what im gonna do  what about dale  hes got an uphill battle   you said you support me  i do  but you didnt say you think im making the right call  this is the right call  lets gather up  come on carl i want you to stay with jimmy  but i wanna listen  hmmmm not this time come on  so how do we do this just take a vote  does it have to be unanimous  how about majority rules  well lets lets just see where everybody stands  then we can talk through the options  well where i sit  theres only one way to move forward  killing him right  i mean why even bother to even take a vote  its clear which way the winds blowing  well if people believe we should spare him  i wanna know  well i can tell you its a small group  maybe just me and glenn  look i  i think youre pretty much right about everything   all the time but this  theyve got you scared  hes not one of us  and weve weve lost too many people already  how about you do you agree with this  couldnt we continue keeping him prisoner  just another mouth to feed  it may be a lean winter   we could ration better  well he could be an asset  give him a chance to prove himself   put him to work  were not letting him walk around  we could put an escort on him  who wants to volunteer for that duty  i will  i dont think any of us should be walking around   with this guy  hes right  i wouldnt feel safe unless he was tied up  we cant exactly put chains around his ankles  sentence him to hard labor  look say we let him join us right  maybe hes helpful maybe hes nice  we let our guard down and maybe he runs off  brings back his 30 men  so the answer is to kill him  to prevent a crime that he may never even attempt  if we do this were saying theres no hope  rule of law is dead there is no civilization  oh my god  could you drive him further out  leave him like you planned  you barely came back this time  there are walkers you could break down   yyou could get lost  or get ambushed  theyre right we should not put our own people at risk  if you go through with it  how would you do it  would he suffer  we could hang him right just snap his neck  i thought about that  shooting may be more humane  and what about the body   do we bury him  hold on hold on  youre talking about this like its already decided  youve been talking all day going around in circles  you just wanna go around in circles again  this is a young mans life  and it is worth more than a fiveminute conversation  is this what its come to  we kill someone because we cant decide what else to do with him  you saved him and now look at us  hes been tortured hes gonna be executed  how are we any better than those people that were so afraid of  we all know what needs to be done  no dale is right  we cant leave any stone unturned here   we have a responsibility  so whats the other solution  let rick finish  we havent come up with a single viable option yet   i wish we could  so lets work on it   we are  stop it just stop it  im sick of everybody arguing and fighting  i didnt ask for this you cant ask us to decide something like this  please decide either of you both of you  but leave me out  not speaking out  or killing him yourself  theres no difference  all right thats enough  anybody who wants the floor  before we make a final decision  has the chance  you once said that we dont kill the living  well that was before the living tried to kill us  but dont you see if we do this  the people that we were  the world that we knew is dead  and this new world is ugly  its  harsh its its survival of the fittest  and thats a world i dont wanna live in  and i dont and i dont believe that any of you do  i cant  please  lets just do whats right  isnt there anybody else whos gonna stand with me  hes right  we should try to find another way  anybody else  are yall gonna watch too  no youll go hide your heads in your tents  and try to forget that were slaughtering a human being  whoa
