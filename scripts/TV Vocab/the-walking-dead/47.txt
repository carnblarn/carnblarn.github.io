merle never could  turns out  it was the tweakers kids favorite show  and he never sees his kids  so he felt guilty about it or something  so he punches merle in the face  so i started hitting the tweaker like hard  as hard as i can  then he pulls a gun  sticks it right here  he says im gonna kill you bitch  so merle pulls his gun on him  everyones yelling im yelling  i thought i was dead  over a dumb cartoon about a talking dog  howd you get out of it  the tweaker punched me in the gut  i puked  they both started laughing and forgot all about it  you want to know what i was before all this  i was just drifting around with merle  doing whatever he said we were gonna be doing that day  i was nobody  nothing  some redneck asshole  and an even bigger asshole for a brother  you miss him dont
