the woods  all this time i thought  she didnt cry herself to sleep  she didnt go hungry  she didnt try to find her way back  sophia died a long time ago   a few more trips  we got lucky  if that barn had any more we couldve been overrun  good thing shane did what he did   when he did  you cant tell me this was right  it wasnt itll cost us with hershel  hes grieving hell come around  see we had no choice  look i shot too this wasnt all shane  look i got no qualms about it  walkers in my backyard  im not saying that we shouldnt have  taken care of the problem but creating a panic  theres no point arguing about it its done  theres nothing we can do about it  better get moving  hey hey  all right  so if your group leaves you wouldnt stay  i i hadnt really thought about it  i mean i i didnt know that  do do you think this is really the time   to discuss this i mean  well im not  really feeling like theres a lot of time for anything  no no there there is  there is i mean ii i want  oh my god  sweetie can you hear me   whats wrong with her  she might be in shock   wheres hershel  we cant find him anywhere  hey kiddo   your stepmothers things  he was so sure shed recover  theyd just pick up where they left off  looks like he found an old friend  that belonged to my grandfather gave it to dad when he died  i didnt take hershel for a drinker  no he gave it up on the day i was born  he didnt even allow liquor in the house   whats the bar in town  hatlins  he practically lived there in his drinking days  betting thats where ill find him  yeah ive seen the place ill take you   all right ill get the truck  okay   n no  its an easy run   like the pharmacy  hey maggie  ill bring him back  maggie that was different  rick you want to have a conversation about this before you leave  so youre seriously gonna go after this guy  with everything thats going on huh   what you gonna do  hes right  this is not the time to head off not today   you dont know whats have  im not arguing  its the least i can do for hershel after we what  after we what  carl said he wouldve shot sophia himself  thats your son hes getting cold  hes growing up in a world with  hes growing up in a world where he needs a father like you  around alive  not running off solving everybody elses problems  its not just his problem im trying to solve  we need hershel for the baby  im going after him   you ready  yeah  hey  carol  carol  hey hey hey hey hey  hey are you all right  come here  i want you to know that im real sorry for your girl  thank you  when i opened that barn i had no idea  if i did  everybody thinks that im a  i was just trying to keep everybody safe  i had no idea she was in there  this place is going to hell  yeah im trying hard to prevent that  you wont be able to  no there are people in this group  who think that what shane did was justified  i know you two cant stand each other  but he did something that needed to be done  hes dangerous  yeah hes a hothead  no lori hes dangerous  i think he killed otis  otis was killed by walkers  he knew how to handle walkers  otis was the one who was putting them in the barn  you need to be really clear with me right now   what are you saying  i believe that  that shane sacrificed otis  i cant prove it but iii  i think that he i think that he shot him  and left him for bait so that he could get away  shane may be a hothead but hes not a murderer  and and why would he kill somebody whos trying to help  i dont know maybe he was pinned down  he said he said it he all but threw it in my face  im telling you i knew guys like him  and sooner or later  hes gonna kill somebody else  maggie said she loves me  she doesnt mean it  i mean she cant  i mean well  she shes upset or confused  shes probably feeling like  i think shes smart enough to know what shes feeling  no no  no you know what she wants to be in love  so shes she needs something to to like to hold onto  glenn its pretty obvious to everyone maggie loves you  and not just because youre one of the last men standing  so whats the problem  i didnt say it back  ive never had a woman say that to me before  except my mom of course  and my sisters  but with maggie its different  we barely know each other  what what does she really know about me  nothing  were practically strangers  but i i didnt know what to do with it  i just stood there like a jerk  hey hey this is a good thing  something we dont get enough of these days  enjoy it  and when we get back return the favor  its not like shes going anywhere  rick  i know about lori  her being pregnant   i got her those pills  i figured  hey im sorry i kept it from you  dont be you did what you thought was right  it just so happens it wasnt  her hearts racing shes burning up  we need hershel hell know what to do   would you look in on carl for me  of course  moving to the suburbs  listen beths in some kind of catatonic shock   we need hershel  yeah so what  so i need you to run into town real quick  and bring him and rick back  daryl  your bitch went windowshopping  you want him i fetch him yourse  i got better things to do  whats the matter with you  dont you be so selfish  selfish listen to me olive oyl  i was out there looking for that little girl every single day  i took a bullet and an arrow in the process  dont you tell me about me getting my hands dirty  you want those two idiots have a nice ride  im done looking for people  hershel  whos with you  glenn  maggie sent him  he volunteered  hes good like that   how many have you had  not enough  lets finish this up back at home  beth collapsed  is in some sort of state  must be in shock i think you are too  maggies with her  yeah but beth needs you  what could i do  she needs her mother  or rather to mourn  like she shouldve done weeks ago  i robbed her of that  i see that now  you thought there was a cure  cant blame yourself for holding out for hope  hope  when i first saw you running across my field  with your boy in your arms  i had little hope he would survive  but he did  he did  even though we lost otis  your man shane made it back  and we saved your boy  that was the miracle that proved to me miracles do exist  only it was a sham a bait and switch  i was a fool rick and you people saw that  my daughters deserve better than that  so what do we do just wait for him to pass out  just go  just go  i promised maggie id bring you home safe  like you promised that little girl  so whats your plan finish that bottle  drink yourself to death and leave your girls alone  stop telling me  how to care for my family my farm  you people are like a plague  i do the christian thing give you shelter  and you destroy it all  the world was already in bad shape when we met  and you take no responsibility  youre supposed to be their leader  well im here now arent i  yes  yes  yes you are  now come on  your girls need you now more than ever  i didnt want to believe you  you told me there was no cure  that these people were dead not sick  i chose not to believe that  but when shane shot lou in the chest  and she just kept coming  thats when i knew what an ass id been  that annette had been dead long ago  and i was feeding a rotten corpse  thats when i knew there was no hope  and when that little girl came out of the barn  the look on your face  i knew you knew it too  right  there is no hope  and you know it now like i do  dont you  there is no hope for any of us   you ready  yeah  man how many times we gonna have to do this  look im done im not doing this anymore  cleaning up after you you know what the truth is  nothing has changed  death is death its always been there  whether its from a heart attack cancer  or a walker whats the difference  you didnt think it was hopeless before did you  now there are people back at home trying to hang on they need us  even if its just to give them a reason to go on  even if we dont believe it ourselves  you know what this this isnt about  what we believe anymore  its about them  son of a bitch theyre alive  im dave  that scrawnylooking douche bag there is tony  eat me dave hey maybe someday i will  we met on i95 coming out of philly  damn shitshow

of them  im truly sorry to hear that  to better days and new friends  and to our dead  may they be in a better place  ah ah  not bad huh  i got it off a cop   im a cop  this one was already dead  you fellas are a long way from philadelphia   it feels like were a long way from anywhere  well what drove you south  well i can tell you it wasnt the weather  i mustve dropped 30 lbs in sweat alone down here   i wish  no first it was dc  i heard there might be some kind of refugee camp  but the roads were so jammed we never even got close  we decided to get off the highways into the sticks  keep hauling ass  every group we came across had a new rumor about a way out of this thing  one guy told us there was the coast guard sitting in the gulf  sending ferries to the islands  the latest was a rail yard in montgomery  running trains to the middle of the country   kansas nebraska  nebraska  low population lots of guns  kinda makes sense ever been to nebraska kid  a reason they call em flyover states  how about you guys  fort benning eventually  i hate to piss in your cornflakes officer but  we ran across a grunt who was stationed at benning  he said the place was overrun by lamebrains  wait fort benning is gone are you for real  sadly i am  oddly the truth is there is no way out of this mess  just keep going from one pipe dream to the next  praying one of these mindless freaks   doesnt grab a hold of you when you sleep  if you sleep  yeah it doesnt look like you guys are hanging your hats here  you holed up somewhere else  not really  those your cars out front  yeah why  were living in ours  those look kinda empty clean  wheres all your gear were with a larger group  out scouting thought we could use a drink  a drink hershel me i thought you qu  well were thinking of setting up around here   is it is it safe  it can be  although i have killed a couple of walkers around here  walkers that what you call them   yeah  thats good  i like that i like that better than lamebrains  more succinct  dars  so what so what you guys set up  on the outskirts or something   that new development  trailer park or something  a farm   old mcdonald had a farm   you
