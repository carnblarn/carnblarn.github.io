we didnt have the resources to treat him  so he volunteered to be the test subject  hes been very cooperative  hes a remarkable man  youre close  we spent a lot of time together  the song the singing bowl the questions  weve done that a few dozen times  these are cues that will hopefully linger  in his unconscious mind even after hes died  there is no unconscious mind milton  when they turn they become monsters  thats all  whoever they once were is gone  well see  you havent seen this before have you  the transformation  no  no one in your family was  im an only child  my parents died when i
