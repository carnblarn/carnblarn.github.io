somewhere else or shes dead   theres no way to find her  so were not even gonna look for her  we gotta keep moving  there have been walkers crawling all over here   i say head east  stay off the main roads  the bigger the road the more walkers  mo assholes like this one i got him  damn it  oh shit   damn  whats wrong  weve been riding red for the past hour  better make sure we dont get forgot   you out  running on fumes  we cant stay here  we cant all fit in one car  well have to make a run for some gas in the morning   spend the night here  im freezing  well build a fire yeah  you go out looking for firewood stay close  only got so many arrows how you doing on ammo   not enough  we cant just sit here with our asses hanging out  watch your mouth  everyone stop panicking and listen to rick  all right well set up a perimeter  in the morning well find gas and some supplies   well keep pushing on  glenn and i can go make a run now   try and scrounge up some gas  no we stay together  god forbid something happens and people get stranded without a car  rick were stranded now  i know it looks bad weve all been through hell and worse  but at least we found each other  i wasnt sure i really wasnt  but we did were together  we keep it that way  well find shelter somewhere theres gotta be a place  rick look around okay  theres walkers everywhere theyre migrating or something  theres gotta be a place not just where we hole up  but that we fortify  hunker down pull ourselves together  build a life for each other  i know its out there we just have to find it  even if we do find a place  and we think its safe  we can never be sure for how long  look what happened with the farm  we fooled ourselves into thinking that that was safe  we wont make that mistake again  well make camp tonight  over there get on the road at the break of day  does this feel right to you  what if walkers come through  or another group like randalls  you know i found randall right  he had turned but he wasnt bit   hows that possible  rick what the hell happened  shane killed randall  just like he always wanted to  and then the herd got hi  were all infected   what  at the cdc  jenner told me  whatever it is  we all carry it  and you never said anything  would it have made a difference   you knew this whole time  how could i have known for sure   you saw how crazy that mo  that is not your call  okay when i found out about the walkers in the barn  i told for the good of everyone  well i thought it best that people didnt know  im sure you had your reasons   is there anything that  i killed him  i killed shane  he came at me  he killed randall to get me into the woods  he planned it  i had i had no choice  i gave him every chance  and he kept leading me further out  he pushed me and i let him  and after awhile i knew  i knew what he was doing what he was up to  and i kept going  i didnt stop  i could have but  i just wanted it over  dogging me every step of the way  acting like i stole you and carl like  like i was in the way  i just wanted it over  i wanted him dead  i killed him  he turned  thats how i knew jenner  jenner was right  carl put him down  ooh  were not safe with him  keeping something like that from us  why do you need him hes just gonna pull you down  no ricks done all right by me  youre his henchman  and im a burden  you deserve better  what do you want  a man of honor  rick has honor  i think we should take our chances  dont be foolish  theres no food no fuel  no ammo   what was that  could be anything  could be a raccoon could be a possum  walker  we need to leave i mean what are we waiting for   which way  it came from over there   back from where we came  yeah  the last thing we need is for everyone to be running off in the dark  we dont have the vehicles  no ones traveling on foot  dont panic  im not  im not sitting here waiting for another herd to blow through   we need to move now  no one is going anywhere   do something  i am doing something  im keeping this group together  alive  ive been doing that all along no matter what  i didnt ask for this i killed my best friend  for you people for christs sake  you saw what he was like  how he pushed me  how he compromised us  how he threatened us  he staged the whole randall thing  led me out to put a bullet in my back  he gave me no choice  he was my friend but he came after me  my hands are clean  maybe you people are better off without me  go ahead  i say theres a place for us  but maybe maybe its just another pipe dream  maybe maybe im fooling myself again  why dont you why dont you go and find out yourself  send me a postcard  go on theres the door  you can do better lets see how far you get  no takers fine but get one thing straight  youre staying  this isnt a democracy anymore
