first things first set camp find sophia  i hate to be the one to ask but somebodys got to  what happens if we find her and shes bit  i think we should all be clear on how we handle that  you do what has to be done  and her mother what do you tell her  the truth  shane ill gather and secure all the weapons  make sure no ones carrying till were at a practice range off site  i do request one rifleman on lookout  dales got experience  our people would feel safer  less inclined to carry a gun  thank you  that stuff you brought  got more antibiotics bandages anything like that  just what

branch of the creek entirely  if she went that direction  shed be miles from where we looked  rick take a moment  come look  thats something isnt it  its good to pause for an occasional reminder  of

anymore  best we stay out of each others way  lori told me your story  how you were shot the coma  yet you came out of it somehow  you did not feel gods hand in yours  at that moment  no i did not  in all the chaos you found your wife and boy  then he was shot and he survived  that tells you nothing  it tells me gods got a strange sense of humor  hes not going for it  maybe cause a canned ham dont

never know carol  we can hang targets along that fence line there  that rise it gives a natural backstop  its a good idea  thanks  so how long before i can carry   chuckles  lets not get ahead of ourselves  im not in a very patient frame of mind these days shane   you might have notice that  no shit  look i aint worried about you offing yourself  even though you got old dale pissing his pants lately   shane chuckles   yeah i noticed that too  he did come within a minute or so of being blown to hell  because of me to be fair  look i see you have the desire for gun work  and desire will take you a long way  but something you need to know so file this carefully   im listening  paper targets is one thing  easy to hit what aint moving  but taking down an assailant  one thats trying to kill you  its different  they say in that kind of situation  things slow down thats crap  they speed up adrenalin ha  itll cripple you if you let it  you need to use your instinct  you got to rule it out  because somebody is going to die  and youd better hope that youre the one whos making that decision  how i mean how do you do that  turn off a switch  the switch  the one that makes you scared or angry  sympathetic whatever  you dont think you just you act  cause odds are somebody else is counting on you  thats your partner  thats your friend  there aint nothing easy about taking a mans life  no matter how little value it may have  but when you get it done  you have to forget it   chuckles   i guess i havent quite got that last part down yet  but youre getting there  i hope so  its a good spot  itll do  you know normally  this is the kind of thing id do on my own  solo  chuckles   its sort of my thing you know  im a loner   you all right  im fine  i saw the look on your face back at the well  never seen one killed up close before  guess its kind of a shock  you know being out on the road weve seen a lot  guess weve gotten a little numb to it  whoa i guess so  ill go see what antibiotics are left  what else is on the list  uh  why dont you get started  what about you  im gonna look around see whats worth grabbing  just some general stuff  what do you got  uh um  nothing  just like i said general stuff  condoms   gasps   you got a girlfriend i dont know about  me no no  then youre a pretty confident guy  no  no no no iii wasnt   i would never  something wrong with me  no  no i   chuckles nervously   i would never have sex  uh im im lost  ill have sex with you  really  why  youre asking questions  okay i cant help wondering  its not like our options are vast these days  and youre not the only one thats lonely  wow  you need to reconsider  i beg your pardon  asking us to leave  you need to reconsider  if you saw how it is out there you wouldnt ask  youre a man of belief  if you believe anything believe that  youre putting me on the spot  well i mean to  those people look to me for answers  i wish they didnt but they do  but im not asking for them or myself  im asking for my boy  after the price your friend otis paid  the least you can do is give it some thought  youre a plainspoken man  im a father  hes the one thing i dont want to fail  i feel like i do every day  i lied to him this morning  it wasnt a big lie but it was enough  my father didnt bother with comforting lies  he used his fist  he was a loveless violent drunk  and no good to anybody  he drove me from home when i was 15  didnt lay eyes on this place again for many years  i was not at his deathbed rick  i would not grant him that  and to this day do not regret it  some men do not earn the love of their sons  i dont see you having that problem  will you consider my request  there are aspects to this  things that i cant and wont discuss  but if you and your people respect my rules  no promises but i will consider it  you have my word  you have mine   footsteps   hey  ill sit with him  he was awake earlier when you were gone  he asked for you   i  dont spoil it  so it was good  it was a onetime thing   everything go okay  fine  nothing happened  did you find it  i cleaned up  wanted it to be nice for her  for a second i thought i was in the wrong place  a flower  its a cherokee rose  the story is that when american soldiers  were moving indians off their land on the trail of tears  the cherokee mothers were grieving and crying so much  cause they were losing their little ones along the way  from exposure and disease  and starvation  a lot of them just disappeared  so the elders they said a prayer  asked for a sign to uplift the mothers spirits  give them strength  and hope  the next day this rose  started to grow right where the mothers tears fell  im not fool enough  to think theres any flowers blooming for my brother  but i believe this one  bloomed for your little girl   laughs   shes gonna really like it in here  hey dad  hey   clears throat   carl  i told you something earlier today about sophia  i know mom told me  here i was getting ready to confess  i didnt mean to lie i just didnt want to worry you  its a stupid excuse  but its all i got  its okay  do you think well find her  i know we will  well   sighs   i dont know  but i truly believe it  you look tired   chuckles  i am tired  hey im like you now  weve both been shot  isnt that weird  yeah i think your mother would rather hear we got the same eyes  so lets keep that between us  since youre in the club now  you get to wear the hat  didnt you know  well pad the rim tomorrow so it sits better  wont you miss it  maybe youll let me borrow it from time to time  we can share it  okay  sleep now  okay  i love you dad  i love you  are you putting them away  stay with him a while longer  ill wait up   urinating    muffled sob   by mikhel for subtituloses spread the word
