every able body weve got  we need em here we need em to protect camp  it seems to me what you really need most here   are more guns  right the guns   wait what guns  six shotguns  two highpowered rifles over a dozen handguns  i cleaned out the cage back at the station before i left  i dropped the bag in atlanta when i got swarmed  its just sitting there on the street waiting to be picked up   ammo  700 rounds assorted  lori you went through hell to find us  you just got here and youre gonna turn around and leave  dad i dont want you to go  to hell with the guns shane is right  merle dixon  hes not worth one of your lives even with guns thrown in  tell me make me understand  i owe a debt to a man i met and his little boy  lori if they hadnt taken me in  id have died  its because of them that i made it back to you at all  they said theyd follow me to atlanta  theyll walk into the same trap i did if i dont warn him  whats stopping you  the walkietalkie the one in the bag i dropped  hes got the other one our plan was to connect when they got closer   these are our walkies  yeah  so use the cb whats wrong with that  the cbs fine  its the walkies that suck to crap  date back to the 70s dont match any other bandwidth  not even the scanners in our cars  i need that bag  okay  all right  rumor is you have bolt cutters   maybe  yeah we get to that roof though  well need to cut that chain and the handcuffs  i never like lending tools  the last time i did  and yes i am talking about you  lets just say your bag of guns  wasnt the only bag that was dropped  my tools got left behind
