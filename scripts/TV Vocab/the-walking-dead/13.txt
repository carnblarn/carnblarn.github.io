wouldnt he  are you only getting yours  i dont know whats going on with you and him   him  shane   dale  its not my business  all that matters to me is that you  you may not really know him  we dont need to do this   you and i are finally  its important  i get it you dont like him   it isnt that  then what is it  is that how you want to be  like him  hes not a victim  you dont know him  dale i need you to stop  you spend so much time  watching me looking out for me  you want to beat me up anytime i show any concern  go ahead im done  im not beating you up dale  im okay really things are  different  you got your gun  okay   you okay  yeah  you mind running and getting me some water  i just  i need a second  youll keep watch  dale  yeah sure  come on in  a little light reading for lunch  been working so hard lately  i get my studying where i can  you know we can help you out with your work  its my field to tend  we found the barn  leave it be  well id like to talk about it  but either way your barn your farm your say  i dont want to talk about the barn i dont want to debate  not a debate a discussion  i need you and your group gone by the end of the week  i talked to dale  you and i have our differences  with the way we look at the walkers  those people  they may be dead they may be alive  but my people us  we are alive right now  right here right in front of you  you send us out there and that could change  ive given you safe harbor  my conscience is clear  this farm  this farm is special  youve been shielded from whats been going on out there  dale said you saw everything happen on the news  well its been its been a long time  since the cameras stopped rolling  the first time i saw a walker  it was just half a body snapping at me from the ground  my inclination wasnt to kill it  but what the world is out there isnt what you saw on tv  it is much much worse and it changes you  either into one of them  or something a lot less than the person you were  please do not do not send us out there again  my wifes pregnant  thats either a gift here  or a death sentence out there  if we were to stay we could help you  with the work with securing this place  we can survive together  rick im telling you we cant   you think about what youre doing  ive thought about it   think about it  ive thought about it  think about it again we cant go out there  whats it gonna be man  which way does this thing go  i dont know yet  well what did he say   were negotiating  youre nego  clocks ticking rick  no it isnt shane  that barn the barn is secure  we didnt even know about it till this morning  we didnt well we know about it now  right we know theres over a dozen walkers in there  we know that its about a stones throw  from our camp rick where we sleep  so look if were not gonna go in there and clear it out then we just got to go  were not gonna clear it out and were not gonna go  we at least need our guns  we cant have them not here  why do you want to stay here when its not safe  we can make it safe   how we gonna do that  we will okay   how we gonna make it safe  we will okay   no man its not okay  shane loris pregnant  we need to stay  we need our guns  no i can work this out   you good  yeah  loris having a baby man  congratulations  thank you  hi honey  carl doesnt need any more of my help  so thats it  rick was trying to make his case  itll be hard theyll have to be careful  but he was being dramatic  theyre a strong group theyve done well on their own  theyre just gonna have to go out and find their own farm  theres plenty of them now to chose from  there arent every one of them nearby  is burned out or full of walkers  walkers  so we just keep these people here forever  how are they my responsibility  a new command i give to you  love one another as i have loved you  thats what you told me right  i was mad about mom  mad about you marrying annette  i was 14 years old and i was awful  to you more than anybody  all i wanted to do was smoke and shoplift  love one another thats what you told me  maggie  that was different  no  youre different  i am  but were not  i love you  thats part of this  is this about you and the asian boy   do you want me to  no  his name is glenn  he saved my life yesterday when one of the people  you think is sick tried to kill me  hows that for dramatic  things arent what you think they are  they arent  dont do this  okay its not about me and glenn  its not about me and you  its about you  its about who you are who youre gonna be  hershel  it happened again  also shows she could be moving this way south  if sophia kept in that direction  she might have gotten out of the forest and into the farmland  so we take 74 up to ivy road  then push down south on foot through the forest till we hit christopher  go east a couple of miles and then double back   rick  hershel  we just have our guns out because were gonna go look for sophia  before you do that i could use your help with something  count me in  thank you but i just need rick  ill be down at the barn keeping watch until youre ready   i thought he was dead  shane i dont  then when he came back right then right there  you see i wished he was  not not because you wouldnt be mine  but because i knew that sooner or later he would be dead  see rick  he aint built for this world  not for what it is now  youre wrong youre wrong  lori how many times has he saved your life  i just i want to know how many times because by my count  ive saved your life on four different occasions and thats carls too  so i just want to ask you how many times has rick saved your life  that night at the camp that night at the camp after the fish fry  no no no see no  that was me too  you see rick he showed up late  because he went on a suicide mission over nothing  yeah he joined in  but see we wouldnt have been in that situation  if he hadnt left because he felt  that he needed to leave to save a drug dealer  and so we lost amy and we lost jim  we lost  rick told me  told you what  and i know the reason why you didnt  is because you know its mine   its ricks  okay  you know we carried on quite a bit  before rick got back lori its mine you know it is  youre wrong youre wrong  im sorry shane im sorry  but even if its yours its not gonna be yours  its never gonne be yours and theres nothing you can do to change that  i dont need to  hey shane  can i talk to you for a sec  you okay  yeah  i know you think sophias dead  and that we should stop looking for her   but thats bullshit  hey man watch your mouth  were gonna stay here until we find her  you think thats what we should do  its what i know we should do  then we stay  that means we got to do  whatever we got to do to make that happen   hmm  like help out with chores  mmm  like help out with the chores  carl  come here for a minute  why dont you go see what your mom wants  hmm go on  hey carl  dont let me hear you talk like that again  sup  son of a bitch  you see where he went   who  dont even try to shit me okay   what  dale glenn  did you see where dale went  yeah he asked me to run and get him some water  he said hed cover me on watch  and he was gone when you got back huh  yeah   you think hes okay  oh hes fine   whyd he bail then  so you wouldnt tell me which way he went  i dont get it  no man you dont  the silt on the bottom is like glue  you just sink in  thats lou bush  you knew him  lou as in louise  she has a farm up the road  sweet corn mostly  worked at hapmans bar on weekends  the man i dont know him  but the coveralls  ive been to where he worked  how many have you killed  too many to count  can you stop  there are people out there  who havent been in their right minds  people who i believe can be restored  youre not talking about the walkers are you  it doesnt matter if you see them as human beings anymore  but if you and your people are going to stay here  thats how youre gonna have to treat them  my farm my barn my say   you see it  see what  ill find her  hey im sorry about what happened this morning  you wanted to look for her  why  this whole time ive wanted to ask you  cause i think shes still out there  truth
