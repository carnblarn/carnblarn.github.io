right  jims not a monster dale or some rabid dog   im not suggesting  hes sick a sick man  we start down that road where do we draw the line  the lines pretty clear zero tolerance for walkers   or them to be  what if we can get him help  i heard the cdc was working on a cure  i heard that too heard a lot of things before the world went to hell  what if the cdc is still up and running   man that is a stretch right there  why  if theres any government left any structure at all  theyd protect the cdc at all costs wouldnt they  i think its our best shot shelter protection  okay rick you want those things all right i do too okay  now if they exist theyre at the army base   fort benning  thats 100 miles in the opposite direction  that is right but its away from the hot zone  now listen to me if that place is operational  itll be heavily armed wed be safe there  rick the military were on the front lines of this thing  they got overrun weve all seen that  the cdc is our best choice and jims only chance  you go looking for aspirin do what you need to do  someone needs to have some balls to take care   of this damn problem  hey hey hey  we dont kill the living  thats funny coming from a man who just put a gun to my head  we may disagree on some things  not on this you put it down  go on   come with me  where are you taking me  somewhere safe  i came to pay my respects  did i ever mention  how i lost my wife   cancer wasnt it  yeah  i dragged her to every doctor  every test  and after all the surgeries and the chemos  she was ready  she accepted it you know  but i never could  and i spent the last few years  so angry  i felt so cheated  since she passed  you girls were the first people  that i cared anything for  this is her birthday  her birthday was always like  like a week long affair  but i somehow always missed it  i was away at college  or too busy for kids parties  shed call all excited  i always said that id make it home  and i really always meant to  but i never made it past that phone call  i know things are hard enough for you  without adding guilt into the mix huh   head squishes   ill do it hes my husband   crying    groans    grunting    sobbing    shallow breathing    breathing   amy  amy im sorry  im sorry  for not ever being there  i always thought thered be more time   growling   im here now amy  im here  i love you   gunshot   say it  okay  im thinking if youd of stayed here  if youd have looked after your own  instead you went off you took half our manpower with you  im thinking maybe our losses wouldnt have been so bad  if we hadnt gone off and brought those guns back  when we did i think our losses would have been a lot worse   maybe the entire camp   truck approaching    exhales   i still think its a mistake not burning these bodies  its what we said wed do right  burn em all wasnt that the idea  shane at first  the chinaman gets all emotional  says its not the thing to do we just follow him along  these people need to know who the hells in charge here   what the rules are  there are no rules  well thats a problem  we havent had one minute to hold onto anything of our old selves  we need time to mourn and we need to bury our dead  its what people do  oh no  no no no no  no not this please   groans     panting    zombies growling   no no no  oh no no no   no no   people scream    panting    crying  i can do it i can do it  i can do it i can do it   crying   hey   panting   burying other people is bad enough   but the thought of one of us  shh  are we safe now dad  now that were together  i wont leave again  i promise you that not for anything  now give me a chance  to discuss some things with your mom okay   yeah  all right  all right  shane blames me for not being here  do you  we got guns now were stronger  and we have fewer people  that makes us weaker  you want me to say i think you were right  i understand that  all i can say is that neither one of you is entirely wrong  its the best i can do right now  what about the cdc   rick  were at the ragged edge here  we need relief and we got a sick man who needs help  i dont know why people cant see that  well look at their faces  look at mine were all terrified  if one of us suggested based on a hunch  that we head toward that city  youd have no part of it  tell me something with certainty  i love you  thats all i got  i love you too   door opens    knocks   his fever is worse  you need anything  uh  water could use more water   lori ill get some  okay  carol you help me  you save a grave for me  nobody wants that  its not about

i need you to help talk some sense into rick  look this cdc thing lori its a mistake  so youre backing him  what else would i do hes my husband  look it may be time for you to play the dutiful wife  but you cant tell me that fixing your marriage  is worth putting peoples lives at risk  i think folks around here can make up their minds without bringing my marriage into it  its a habit you need to break  i guess ill just add it to the list  of habits that im breaking  whether i like it or not  what habits  just talking about my need for a plan man  so what is it are we leaving or not  maybe

these people man theyre not convinced  you know  you head to the cdc  you might be on your own  you gotta really consider whether you want  to put lori and carl in that kind of spot  i got to do whats best for my family  best for your family whats that   exposing them to all kinds of risks  as opposed to what  crossing 100 miles of hostile territory  if were looking for a lifeline i say swim toward the closest ship  not further out to sea  why cant you back me up  look i want to its just  i dont see it  if it was your family youd feel differently  what did you say to me  i kept em safe man  i
