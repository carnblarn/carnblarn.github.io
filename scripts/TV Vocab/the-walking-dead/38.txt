                previously on amcs the walking dead  walkers in d  rick we lost a lot of good people  this is sickness  all of us in here weve all been exposed  lizzie and mica can you look out for them like theyre yours  you shouldnt get too close to anyone that might have been exposed  we should keep you separated  ill see what we have in the way of medications  david hes been coughing too   distant coughing   you found them like this  i came to see karen  and i saw the blood on the floor  then i smelled them  somebody dragged them out here  and set them on fire  they killed them and set them on fire  youre a cop  you find out who did this and you bring em to me  you understand you bring em to me  well find out who   i need to say it again  no no  i know what youre feeling ive been there  you saw me there its dangerous   karen didnt deserve this  no  david didnt deserve it   nobody does  all right man lets  man i aint going nowhere till i find out who did this  were on the same side man  hey look  i know what youre going through  weve all lost someone  we know what youre going through right now  but youve got to calm down  you need to step the hell back  she wouldnt want you being like this  stop stop  carol stop   grunting   daryl thats enough  thats enough   grunts    daryl rick   tyreese groans    stop  let go of me   no no  let go of me  no   sobbing    theme music playing    this is gonna be sprained at least a week   winces   good news none of these cuts need stitches  i wouldnt plan on much typing the next few days  you okay  it hurts  i wasnt talking about the hand  we just went through something terrible  everything weve been working so hard to keep out  it found its way in  no  its always there  council meeting tomorrow morning  thought you should know  we just lost 12 of our own  two more we killed in cold blood  we could be facing an outbreak  i think ive done enough damage for one day  ive fallen off the wagon before   thats what this is  pretty close  when it happened i didnt stand around feeling bad about it  i got back up  i had responsibilities  people to keep safe   grunting   lets get you cleaned up man  you might even need a couple stitches  not until theyre in the ground  you should at least let hershel or dr s  take a look at you make sure nothings broken  when theyre in the ground   grunting   im gonna be okay right  i mean karen and david they were already sick  so if we were gonna get it wed have had it by now  it doesnt happen on a timeline  its different with everyone  but we could be okay  yeah we could be  everything could be okay  if its walkers if its people  we can do something we can fight  but with this im just digging graves   coughing   got to see dr s  im gonna be okay   panting   dr s   people moaning coughing    coughing   dr s   growling   dr s we have to tell them  its starting  hershel its spread  everyone who survived the attack in cell block d  sasha caleb and now others  oh jesus  so what do we do  first things first cell block a is isolation  we keep the sick people there like we tried with karen and david  what the hell we gonna do about that  ask rick to look into it  try to make a timeline whos where when  but what are we gonna do to stop this  there is no stopping it  you get it you have to go through it   but it just kills you  the illness doesnt  the symptoms do we need antibiotics  daryl weve been through every pharmacy nearby  and then some  that veterinary college at west peachtree tech  thats one place people may not have thought to raid for medication  the drugs for animals there are the same we need  thats 50 miles  too big a risk before  aint now im gonna take a group out  best not waste any more time  im in  you havent been exposed  daryl has you get in a car with him  hes already given me fleas   chuckles  i can lead the way  i know where everythings kept  when were out there its always the same  sooner or later we run  i can draw you a map  there are other precautions i feel we should take  carol like what  theres no telling how long itll be  before daryl and his group return  wouldnt it make sense for us to separate the most vulnerable  we can use the administration building  separate office separate room  who is the most vulnerable  the very young  what about the old   squeaking    gurgling   give me another go at it  the whole lines mudded up  the end is dragging the bottom again  well have to go out there and clear it  set the bird go out through the tombs  swing around through the forest route  we got enough for now thats tomorrows problem  rick five more people have come down with it since sasha went in  theres not a lot of us left  what if you get sick what if i do  what if we get in trouble out there and dont come back  lets get this up to the people who need it  lets get what we have to get done first  is carl pretty pissed about going into quarantine  of course  but its better to be safe  always better to be safe  you should talk to him  we should both pay our respects  ill take this up first meet you  im sorry about what happened  what i did to you  everything  its on both of us  you got to find who did this  i didnt know david much  did you  did anyone have a problem with him or karen  no no way  i was with her all the time every day  she got along with everybody same with david  they were the only two who were sick  the person who did it might have trying to stop this thing from spreading  they didnt  now sasha has it  look whoever it was who did this  theyre not going anywhere well find them  today right now  because im not feeling the urgency  all i see you doing is pumping water  in fact what im picking up is  murder is okay in this place now  no it is not  but we have to save lives
