                1 previously on amcs the walking dead  dont hurt my little girl  no  everything okay with her  she might be one of us  what makes you think this man wants to negotiate   we have to work this out  theres nothing to work out  were gonna kill him  we have a lot to talk about   you attacked us  makes things pretty clear  i was trying to make things clear  i could have killed you all i didnt  and here we are  im gonna remove my weapon  show that i mean to negotiate in good faith  id like you to do the same  may i  see  no trouble  now you  well  suit yourself  hes already in there  sat down with rick  i dont see any cars  it dont feel right  keep it running  heads up  what the hell whys your boy already in there   hes here  yup   whats going on  nothing  your friend isnt much for small talk  you want to talk talk  i wanted you to talk  too many people have died for no reason  lets end this  save the bullets for the real threat  we can solve this  thats why i asked you to come here  i know what youve done  i heard about the raids the heads   maggie  merle did that  no you know what im talking about  you know all about me and i know all about you  i dont care about any of that  were here to move forward  maybe i should go inside  the governor thought it best if he and rick spoke privately  who the hell are you  milton mamet  great he brought his butler  im his advisor  what kind of advice  planning biters  uh you know im sorry  i dont feel like i need to explain myself to the henchmen  you better watch your mouth sunshine  look if you and i are gonna be out here pointing guns at each other all day  do me a favor shut your mouth  we dont need this if all goes south in there  well be at each others throats soon enough  carl come here  you stash these at the loading dock all right  beth put more up on the catwalk  if anyone gets pinned down we need to make sure that they have plenty of ammo  ill go work on the cage outside  what we should be doing is loading some of this firepower  in a truck and paying a visit to the governor  we know where he is right now  are you suggesting that we just go in and kill him  yeah i am  we told rick and daryl that wed stay put  ive changed my mind sweetheart  being on the sideline with my brother out there  aint sitting right with me  the three of them are right in the middle of it  no idea were coming they could get taken hostage or killed  a thousand things could go wrong  and they will  my dad can take care of himself  sorry son but your dads head  could be on a pike real soon  dont say that to him  its not the right move  not now  cant take the risk of putting them in the crossfire  thats my decision its final  ive known you both at different times  but only after the world went to shit  and you both stepped up for the good of others  at great personal risk   theres no reason  get to it  woodbury takes west of the river  the prison takes east  no one crosses no one trades  hes right  we should hammer out boundaries then leave each other   im sorry what is this  its a solution  absolutely not  what the hell am i doing here you told me   told him what  you told me he was willing to talk  i am but the truth is rick  shes in no position to make such an offer anyway  im here for one thing only  your surrender  oh you want surrender come get it  you think we hit woodbury heavy last time  just take it easy all right were here to settle this  youre right would you step outside   what  rick and i we got a lot to talk about   im not leaving  i came to talk to him  so youre the governor  thats thats their term not mine  oh  but still  youre beholden to your people   well of course  you have responsibility to them  mmhmm  wasnt merle your lieutenant  he was helpful yeah  but you knew he was erratic  you blame him for scooping up glenn and maggie in the first place  exactly i was trying to sort it out  when you attacked  so it was his fault  hes a wild card but hes effective  he gets the dirty jobs done  i thought youd take responsibility  i thought you were a cop not a lawyer  either way i dont pretend to be a governor  i told you im their leader  youre the town drunk  who knocked over my fence and ripped up my yard  nothing more  didnt you ever misjudge someone  hmm  andrea told me about your baby  that it might be your partners  but youre caring for her and i admire that  restitution for your own lack of insight  for failing to see the devil beside you  oh i see him all right  i brought whiskey  theres no reason not to use this time we have together  to explore the issues ourselves   boss said to sit tight and shut up  dont you mean the governor  its a good thing theyre sitting down  especially after what happened  theyre gonna work it out nobody wants another battle  i wouldnt exactly call it a battle  i would call it a battle and i did  i recorded it  for what  somebodys got to keep a record of what weve gone through  itll be a part of our history  that makes sense  ive got dozens of interviews  after you  no way you first  pussy  look what hes got  nah i prefer menthols  douchebag  you army or something  nah i just  just hate these things  yeah  after what they did  to my wife kids  sucks  thanks  this is a joke right  they aint gonna work anything out  sure theyll do their little dance  and tomorrow next day  theyll give the word  i know  hey  may i ask how you lost your leg  i was bit  so you cut off your leg  to keep the infection from spreading  interesting  how long after the initial bite  immediately  you didnt bleed out  we have good people  they took care of me  doctors  no  we learned by trial and error  me too  may i see it  your stump id like to um  ahem see where the amputation was  how high above the bite  im not showing you my leg  its important data  i just met you  at least buy me a drink first  i care about my people  and i dont take their deaths lightly  and i know you dont either  in a way this fight  its a failure of leadership  then leave us alone  well now that would be an even bigger failure  youve moved into our backyard  you shot up main street  if i let that threat persist i look weak  and well the whole thing crumbles  well thats your problem your choice  now isnt that why were here  choice  if we choose to destroy  everything weve fought for over the past year  were gonna kill everyone we know  at your prison  back in woodbury  people we love rick  i was at work one day  taking shit from a boss half my age  and an iq even lower  and the phone rang  my wife had been in an accident  sorry mr blake we did everything we could  i sat there holding that phone  knowing that i would never see her again  gone  it was just an accident no ones fault  she left a voicemail asking me to call her  but i hadnt had a chance yet  i sat there clutching that phone thinking  what did she want  just to check in  ask me to pick something up for dinner  what did she want  hey youre not going  i dont need permission   i cant let you  you cant stop me  if youre gonna live here with us its gonna be on our terms  if michonne can do it why cant you  cause its my brother out there thats why  whats the matter with yall  im not gonna let you put them in danger  nut up already boy  this guy cops a feel of your woman  and you pussy out like this  get out of my way  no  get out of my way  let me go let me go  if youll excuse me  hows it going in there  they kicked me out  i dont know what im doing here  youre trying to help  what happened with maggie  hes a sick man  what am i gonna do now  i cant go back there  were family you belong with us  but if you join us  its settled  i know  you know the truth is i didnt want any of this  they chose me because there was nobody else around  and they still think that im the man  that can keep them safe  they still think i know what im doing  i know you got guns  mmm that was quite a stash you brought back the other day  now my people theyre not combattested like yours are  but ive got more of them  so this fight it will go down to the last man  so lets end it  today  lets not do this  we can walk away  you have something  that i want  one thing that makes this all all right  im not giving up the prison  no  no i  i dont want your prison that doesnt sound safe at all  i mean you lost your wife another man  were not moving on  what good would that do me  best you stay where i can keep my one good eye on you  i want michonne  turn her over and this all goes away  is she worth it  one woman  worth all those lives at your prison  is she  you know im right  the folks here  theyre strong  good fighters  but they aint killers  rick is  maggie is  carl put down his own mother  mercy killing  that dont make him an assassin  mmm but you are  when i have to be  then how do you explain letting me get away  i must have been seduced  by your sterling personality  you coming with me or not  me and my brother we have a few calls we use when we hunt  ill give him a heads up  hell warn the others  you shogun the governors ass  ill take care of the rest  well be home before you know it  and what about andrea  bullets fly shes gonna have to make her choice real quick  youre on your own  you get people killed its on you  hey  i thought it was my watch  i got it  keep you company  that was a hell of a choke hold  i should have put him to sleep  when we got back from woodbury  i made it all about me  and you needed your space and i didnt give you that  oh i didnt need my space from you  i just  wanted you to see me  im with you  im always with you you know  im sorry  i know   im sorry  i know  oh god i love you  i love you   wait  hmm  i cant do this  come here come here come here   ow  im okay  yeah i dont get it  youve obviously got big plans  like youre the guy whos gonna lick this thing  bring us back from the brink  so why waste your time on a twobit vendetta  why risk it all  you could have a statue of yourself  in the town square governor  killing michonne  is sort of beneath you dont you think  you could save your son  save your daughter  everyone you know  its your choice  if i give you michonne  how do i know youll keep your word  that youll stop  you can have everything you want  i told you i dont care about you  you think about it  two days  ill be here at noon  what you got going on   high notes eyes closed   holding on   and i dont want another   day to break   mmm   take our   steal our night away   lets get inside  position gunmen all around that feed store  the minute you see michonne you open fire  kill the others but you keep her alive  what about the deal  well theyll bring rick merles brother  maybe glenn merle himself  we can take care of the whole crew  its the best way to avoid a slaughter  that is a slaughter  not at our end  were gonna have to eliminate rick sooner or later  no way we can all live side by side  thanks for setting that up  you really put yourself out there  glad i could help  rick and i set terms  hes gonna consider them  and then well meet again in two days  what sort of terms  hope it works out  so i met this governor  sat with him for quite a while  just the two of you  yeah  should have gone when we had the chance bro  he wants the prison  he wants us gone  dead  he wants us dead  for what we did to woodbury  were going to war  warm shadow   what you got in store for me   warm shadow   eyes closed next to me   warm shadow   what you got in store for me   the groups taking it as well as can be expected  merle and michonne are convinced  we should hit first  carol and i think we should take our chances on the road  were in this together  so if we stay and fight  so be it  he gave me a choice  a way out  what does he want  michonne  hell kill her  and then kill us anyway  what if he doesnt  what if this is the answer  why didnt you tell them  they need  to be scared  they are  good  cause thats the only way theyll accept it  she saved my life  and carls  glenn maggie  if she hadnt come here  we never would have known they were taken  shes earned her place  yeah  yeah she has  are you willing to sacrifice your daughters lives for her  why are you telling me  because  im hoping you can talk me out of it
