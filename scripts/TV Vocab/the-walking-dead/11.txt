 yeah yeah he said i should ask you  all right then thanks  nothing about what daryl found screams sophia to me  anyone could have been holed up in that farmhouse  anybody includes her right  whoever slept in that cupboard was no bigger than yayhigh   its a good lead  maybe well pick up her trail again  no maybe about it im gonna borrow a horse  head up to this ridge right here take a birdseye view of the whole grid   if shes up there ill spot her  good idea  maybe youll see your chupacabra up there too   chupacabra  you never heard this  our first night in camp daryl tells us that the whole thing reminds him  of a time when he went squirrel hunting and he saw a chupacabra  what are you braying at jackass  you believe in a bloodsucking dog  do you believe dead people walking around  hey hey ever fire one before  well if im going out i want one  yeah and people in hell want slurpees  why dont you come train tomorrow  if youre serious im a certified instructor  for now he can come with us  hes yours to babysit then  all right andrea tdog i want you guys  nice guitar  dale found it on the highway  you know we still have 11 condoms  you see 11 condoms i see 11 minutes of my life im never getting back  it wasnt that bad was it  look i dont even know if i like you  but youre thinking about it  you should  you remember the name of that waitress at the dairy queen  when we were in high school  i know you shane well enough to know that there is only one  surefire way of engaging you in a conversation  and that is to start asking you about girls you did in high school  i dont want to but ill willing to do it if thats what it takes  maryanne  i told you about her  in excruciating detail  excruciating my ass  you used to live for those details back in the day  i was impressionable  and i may have been living vicariously through you  why wouldnt you  with my impressive list of accomplishments  i was an artist in his prime   a protege  you mean prodigy  maybe  is prodigy what you call a young high school stud  that bangs 30yearolds on the regular  what 30yearold were you banging in high school   the pe teacher  mr daniels  mrs kelly  the girls volleyball coach wasnt she married  cmon  you know what i just remembered  why i never ask you about this stuff  why dont we talk about your high school love life then huh  well thats a short conversation   it may even already be over  that right  there was holly right  nope that was me too  then there was sheila thats the one you lied to me about  i never lied about sheila  i just got mixed up about what the bases meant  just so you know a home run that usually means a sexual act   thats intercourse  yeah i realize that now  i think what you did was more like a ground rule double or something  im aware of the judges ruling  shouldnt be talking about this stuff  that life its gone and everyone in it  sheila  maryanne mrs kelly  its like were old folk  all the people in our stories are all dead   we cant just forget them  the hell we cant  its hard enough accepting whats happened  without digging up the past  ill tell you what it is  its nostalgia  its like a drug  keeps you from seeing things the way they are  thats a danger you got people depending on you  you think i dont know that  i dont know  what are we doing  you got every able body at your disposal  out scourging these woods for a little girl we both know is likely dead  you think we should abandon the search  its not my call is it  im asking im asking  survival rick it means making hard decisions  but youve got this knack you spread us thinner and thinner  im trying to save lives here  and youre out saving cats from trees  is that what you think sophia is a cat in a tree  dont do that man dont twist my words  how many times we get called up to look for a missing child man  you got 72 hours  youre looking for a body and that was before  i mean you honestly think were just gonna find sophia alive  are you that sure we wont   we being completely honest  im counting on you to be  its math man  love or not sophia she only matters  to the degree in which she dont drag the rest of us down  i thought you wanted honest  if wed just moved on man wed be halfway to fort benning  right now and carl wouldnt have gotten shot  you said so yourself  but were out here were risking lives  your own son almost died otis he paid that bill  what the hell are we still doing this for  i had her in my hand shane she looked in my eyes  and trusted me i failed her  if i hadnt she wouldnt be out here  i think shes still alive and im not  im not gonna write her off  its blue  its andrea and tdog  looks like we wandered into their grid  sophia  whoa easy easy  whoa whoa whoa  son of a bitch  mind your own business glenn  youre pregnant  you cant tell anybody okay  you havent told him yet  something wrong  i just had a long talk with shane  he wants to call off the search  what do you think  what if it was carl  would you want us to keep looking  if it was carl yes id want to know one way or another  shane says my good intentions are making us weaker  that i cant make the hard decisions for the good of the group  theyre all hard decisions  but maybe im holding on to a way of thinking  that doesnt make sense anymore  he says its math basic survival  how much fuel how much food how much ammo  not much room in that equation for being soft  its pretty simple when you start thinking of life like that  hey  none of us were prepared to be living life this way  you are making the best decisions you can  with the information you have i dont see soft in that  mr grimes my dad wants to talk to you  oh come on  youve done half stop being such a pussy  come on  one of my horses is missing  did one of your people take it  i was
