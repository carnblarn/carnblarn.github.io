this place by now  we aint scared of that prick  yall should be  that truck through the fence thing  thats just him ringing the doorbell  we might have some thick walls to hide behind  but hes got the guns and the numbers  and if he takes the high ground around this place  shoot he could just starve us out if he wanted to  lets put him in the other cell block  no hes got a point  this is all you you started this  what difference whose fault it is what do we do  i said we should leave  now axels dead  we cant just sit here  get back here  youre slipping rick  weve all seen it we understand why  but now is not the time  you once said this isnt a democracy  now you have to own up to that  i put my familys life in your hands  so get your head clear  and do something  you shouldnt be out here  im a good shot  yes you are  hey dad  yeah  if i say something will you promise not to be mad  i wont get mad  you should stop  stop what  being the leader  let hershel and daryl handle things  you

now  no  andrea you have to straighten this out  they want noah to fight  whos talking about fighting  youre supposed to be teaching people to defend themselves  not raising an army  wake up  the only way to defend ourselves is with an army  take watch eyes open head down  fields filled with walkers  i didnt see any snipers out there  but well keep maggie on watch  ill get up in the guard tower  take out half them walkers give these guys a chance to fix the fence  or use some of the cars to put the bus in place  we cant access the field without burning through our bullets  so were trapped in here theres barely any food or ammo  been here before well be all right  thats when it was just us  before there was a snake in the nest  man we gonna go through this again  look merles staying here hes with us now   get used to it  hey  all yall  seriously rick i dont think merle living here is really gonna fly  i cant kick him out  i wouldnt ask you to live with shane after he tried to kill you  merle has military experience  he may be erratic  but dont underestimate his loyalty to his brother  what if we solve both problems at once  deliver merle to the governor bargaining chip  give him his traitor maybe declare a truce  youre the farmer hershel  and youre the black sheep merle  howd you lose it  i was bit  bit you hack it off yourself  no  rick did  awful kindly of him  saved my life  gave me more time with my girls  gave you more time with your brother  cant put a price on that  cant put a price on anything anymore  i found this  in one of the cells  lost more than the good book there for a while  lost my way  and if your right hand offends you  cut it off cast it from you  for it is profitable  that one of your members should perish  and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell  matthew 529 and 30  woodbury had a damn fine library  one of the only things i miss about it  when the governor returns  hes gonna kill me first  michonne my brother  then your girls  glenn carl the baby  whoever else is left  hell save rick for last  so he can watch his family and friends die ugly  thats who youre dealing with  this is mrs mcleod  shes the one with

 this whole hunting you down thing  that was just business  carrying out orders  hmm like the gestapo  yeah exactly  ive done a lot of things i aint proud of  before and after  anyway hope we can get past it  let bygones be bygones  its a diversionary tactic  it keeps the walkers away  didnt work so well with those two  you got a camp  its just us  we have a town its walled  theres about 70 of us

the cell block  there  well can i go in   i wont allow that  im not an enemy rick  we had that field and courtyard  until your boyfriend tore down the fence  with a truck and shot us up  he said you fired first  well hes lying  he killed an inmate who survived in here  we liked him he was one of us  i didnt know anything about that  as soon as i found out i came  i didnt even know you were in woodbury until after the shootout  that was days ago  i told you i came as soon as i could   what have you told them  nothing  i dont get it i left atlanta with you people  and now im the odd man out  he almost killed michonne and he would have killed us  with his finger on the trigger  isnt he the one who kidnapped you  who beat you  look  i cannot excuse or explain what philip has done  but i am here trying to bring us together  we have to work this out  theres nothing to work out  were gonna kill him  i dont know how or when but we will  we can settle this  there is room at woodbury for all of you  you know better than that  what makes you think this man wants to negotiate  did he say that  no  then why did you come here  because hes gearing up for war  the people are terrified they see you as killers  theyre training to attack  ill tell you what next time you see philip  you tell him im gonna take his other eye  were taken too much shit for too long  he wants a war hes got one  rick  if you dont sit down and try to work this out  i dont know whats gonna happen  he has a whole town  look at you  youve lost so much already  you cant stand alone anymore  you want to make this right get us inside   no  then we got nothing to talk about  there are innocent people  you poisoned them  i just told them the truth  i didnt choose him over you  i wanted a life  once we entered woodbury you became hostile   thats cause i could see it  see what  that you were under his spell from the second you laid eyes on him   that is not true  and you still are  no i am there because those people need me  and what about these people  im trying to save them too  i did not realize the messiah complex was contagious  go to hell michonne  he sent merle to kill me  would have sent him to kill you too if you had come with me  but you didnt did you  hmmmm  you chose a warm bed over a friend  thats why i went back to woodbury  exposed him for what he is  i knew that it would hurt you  dr stevens will be here soon well get you checked over   thank you  no its my pleasure  now youre welcome to stay as long as you like  we got food fresh clothing hot water  normally wed provide you with weapons and a car for your journey  but we need all we have  looks like youre battening down the hatches were you guys attacked  yeah but not by biters some dangerous people out there  they came at us a few days ago  anyone hurt  there were several fatalities   damn sorry  yeah  cant be too careful these days  when youre ready to travel head west  avoid anything north up 85  we just came from there  ran into some whackjob in a prison  you saw him  oh yeah screaming like an idiot  hes a little unhinged  but the others seemed decent  everything seemed cool until their leader came back  and practically shoved a gun in my face  you were at the prison  we went in for shelter lost allens wife  this guy rick showed up all of sudden chased us out  you need help with these guys were in  well now no  we couldnt ask you to join in our fight  look we dont want to be out there  its only a matter of time before  no i understand  whatever we got to do to earn our keep  were you inside the prison  can you describe the layout  its pretty confusing but i could try  you get your rest  we can talk about it tomorrow  as i say youre welcome to stay here as long as you like  but you take the night talk it over  good night  you cant leave without meeting little asskicker  may i hold her   of course  oh  got her  i got her  oh look at you  let me guess  daryl named her asskicker  thats not really her

night we left the farm  that whole randall thing was a lie  shane tried to kill rick  shane loved rick  shane loved lori  ricks become cold  unsteady  he has his reasons  the governor you need to do something  i am  no you need to sleep with him  give him the greatest night of his life  you get him to drop his guard  then when hes sleeping you can end this  thanks  can you spare it  yeah  well
