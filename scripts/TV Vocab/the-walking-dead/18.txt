                previously on amcs the walking dead  if you wanna kill me youre gonna have to do better than a wrench  hes just a kid  we reconvene at sunset then what happens happens  isnt there anybody else whos gonna stand with me   this is a young mans life  do it  take him away  do something  sorry brother  dale could could get under your skin  he sure got under mine  because he wasnt afraid to say exactly what he thought  how he felt  that kind of honesty is rare  and brave  whenever id make a decision  id look at dale  hed be looking back at me with that look he had  weve all seen it one time or another  i couldnt always read him but he could read us  he saw people for who they were  he knew things about us  the truth  who we really are  in the end he was talking about losing our humanity  he said this group was broken  the best way to honor him is to unbreak it  set aside our differences and pull together  st feeling sorry for ourselves  and take control of our lives  our safety  our future  were not broken  were gonna prove him wrong  from now on  were gonna do it his way  that is how we honor dale   itll be tight  dont worry about that  with the swamp hardening the creek drying up  with 50 head of cattle on the property  we might as well be ringing a damn dinner bell  shes right  we shouldve moved you in a while ago  all right lets move the vehicles near each of the doors   facing out toward the road  just leave it there  well build a lookout in the windmill  another in the barn loft that should give us sightlines  both sides of the property  tdog you take the perimeter around the house  keep track of everyone coming and going  what about standing guard  i need you and daryl on double duty  gotcha  ill stock the basement with food and water  enough that we can all survive there a few days if need be   what about patrols  lets get this area locked down first  after that shanell assign shifts  while me and daryl take randall offsite and cut him loose  were back to that now  it was the right plan first time around  poor execution  thats a slight understatement  you dont agree but this whats happening  swallow it move on  you know that dales death and the prisoner  thats two separate things right  you wanna take daryl as your wingman  be my guest   thank you  you got it  i see why youre not taking shane with you  just know ive got no more patience  where hes concerned  hes turning over a new leaf  andrea  when im out with daryl  help hershel keep an eye on things around here   me  shanes got a way  of letting things get out of hand  especially when hes all torqued up  i think were all a bit torqued up at this point  if youre staying here permanently hes got to understand  that its what rick and i say not whatever he wants   youve become close  we talk  then you know hes not a bad guy  hes just his own worst enemy  you want me to babysit shane  i need to make sure every time i leave the farm  all hell doesnt break loose  then maybe you should stop leaving   will you keep an eye on things  of course   hey shane  whats up man  what you doing wandering around by yourself  if um if i tell you something  will you promise not to tell my parents  i think its probably a bad idea for both of us bud  hey carl  come on back  go on  i took it from daryls motorcycle  if he found out i took it hed kill me  what you doing with this  dale its my fault that he died  carl why would you say that man he got bit by a walker   why you say  i saw that walker  i was gonna shoot it  when he was stuck in the mud  i was i was throwing rocks at him and stuff  but i was gonna do it shoot it right in the head  and it it got free came after me and  i ran away if i had killed it dale would still be here  carl i want you to stop that okay  this aint your fault  but you need to hold onto this  you need to protect yourself  as long as im around you nothings gonna happen to you carl  but i cant keep my eyes on you 247 only you can do that   carl take it  im never touching another gun again  that aint no option carl okay  just give it back to daryl  the men are in there  you can put your stuff upstairs in my room  with your dad in the house  i just im just gonna put my stuff over there  whoa dont dont dont strain yourself  thank you  rick and carl and i are taking the corner of the living room  you can put that in my room  youll be more comfortable there   we cant do that  a pregnant woman and child sleeping on the floor   while ive got a bed to myself  this is still your house  its our home ill take the couch downstairs  on nights when i came home reeking of bourbon  my wife would lock the bedroom door  im sad to say that couch and i become old friends  look if you two cant decide ill take it  thank you  the couch is mine  its gonna get real cozy  real fast in here  wouldnt that be easier if you waited for some help  aint no use waiting for something that aint gonna come  no ill just  just do it all myself  yeah you always do  just like that time you showed up rick fixing our sink  yeah  just so you know thats not the reason your basement flooded  you can thank rick for that  using rubber washers with a metal pipe  please come down  so after sophia i uh  i thought well figure this out  you know well heal somehow  after dale  this is real  and we cant  keep it at bay its already got us  and it just keeps coming doesnt it  i made a mess of things  i put you and rick at odds  i dont even know whose baby this is  i cant imagine how hard that is on you  you led us out of atlanta with no thought for yourself  do you remember that night  the flames the  and im sitting in our car  thinking were gonna be all right  hes gonna make it all right well get out of here  and i never thanked you for that  even though things got  confused between us  you were there for me  you were there for me thank you  you dont need to thank me for that   of course i do of course i do  no you  whatever happened between us  whatever the hell we thought it was  and not just you but  im sorry shane  please believe me i am so sorry  take him out to senoia hour there hour back  give or take we may lose the light  but well be halfway ho by then  this little pain in the ass will be a distant memory  good riddance  carols putting together some provisions for him  enough to last a few days  that thing you did last night  aint no reason you should do all the heavy lifting  so are you good with all this  i dont see you and i trading haymakers  on the side of the road nobodyd win that fight  im gonna take a piss  hey man you seen carl lately  hes inside with his mother  look he came to me  okay i wasnt supposed to say anything  but he was out in the swamps yesterday  and he came across a walker stuck in the mud  he got scared ran off  the same walker that killed dale  thats the one   ill have lori talk to him  look man i think  i think he wants to talk to his father  well i need this randall thing done already  man that needs to wait okay  its my call  how about i ride out with daryl  good for us to spend a little time together  nah i need you here  dont think ill handle it right huh   didnt say that  what you say  you know your son  he gave me this  you should get that back to daryl huh  freeing that prisoner  more important to you than carl  andrea hey did you try pumping the gas pedal  i think its been parked too long  you gotta tap it three times  and give her a twist i know know  let me see  uh dale told me that in these old vehicles  the points get corroded  screwdriver  flathead  okay  could you hand me a file  i let him down  he was proud of you  maybe not in that moment but overall  oh thats easy for you to say  you had his back  i have my share of regrets  but i think that he knew  how much we cared for him  that might do it  glenn  bet itll work  mom said youd be here  told her i would stand lookout  i got tired of helping around the house  take it  what happened to dale had nothing to do with you  he he died dad  yeah  yeah  feels like theres a lot of that going around  thats why i need you  no more kid stuff  i wish you could have the childhood i had  but thats not gonna happen  people are gonna die  im gonna die mom  theres no way you can ever be ready for it  i try to be but i cant  the best we can do now is avoid it as long as we can  keep one step ahead  i wish i had something better to say  something something more profound  my father was good like that  but im tired son  please take it  only got so many arrows  is that dales gun  yeah  wish i knew where the hell mine is   ready  yeah   ill get the package  thanks  yo randy  governor called youre off the hook  oh hell no  shh go that way  go on go on  shhshhshhshh

about me  just trying to   whats wrong  randalls missing  missing how  how longs he been gone   whats goin on  its hard to say  the cuffs are still hooked   he must slipped em  is that possible  it is if youve got nothing to lose  the door was secured from the outside  rick rick   what happened  hes armed   hes got my gun  are you okay  im fine little bastard just snuck up on me   he clocked me in the face  all right hershel tdog  get everybody back in the house  glenn daryl come with us   t im gonna need that gun  just let him go  that was the plan wasnt it to just let him go  the plan was to cut him loose far away from here  not on our front step with a gun  dont go out there yall know what can happen  get everybody back in the house  lock all the doors and stay put   lets go back in the house  okay  i saw him head up through the trees that way before i blacked out  im not sure how long  he couldnt have gotten far  hes hobbled exhausted   and armed  so are we   can you track him  no i dont see nothing  hey look there aint no use in tracking him okay  he went that way we need to pair up  we spread out we just chase him down thats it  kid weighs a buck25 soaking wet  you trying to tell us he got the jump on you  i say a rock pretty much evens those odds wouldnt you  alright knock it off you and glenn start heading up the right flank  me and shanell take the left  remember randalls not the only threat out there  keep an eye out for each other  looks like its busted pretty bad  its fine man  dont worry about me  this is pointless you got a light  come on  were just back to square one  if youre gonna do a thing  you might as well do it right  theres two sets of tracks right here  shane mustve followed him a lot longer than he said  theres fresh blood on this tree  theres more tracks  looks like theyre walking in tandem  sorry  yeah there was a little dust up right here   what do you mean  i mean something went down  its getting weird  had a little trouble  oh

none you can see  no im telling you he died from this  hows that possible  you say he got you with a rock  thats what i said  inside the shed  cause that door was shut when tdog rolled up  i saw that too  mustve slipped through the rafters in the roof  so this is where you planned to do it  its a good place as any  at least have the balls to call this what it is  murder  you really believe if you walk back onto that farm alone   no me no randall  i want you to hush up  you really believe theyre gonna buy whatever bullshit story you cook up  thats just it it aint no story  i saw that prisoner
