to be  but anger makes you stupid  stupid gets you killed  arent you still angry about the governor  what he did  if he was here right now  id cut him in two  cause thats how it needs to be  but im not angry  i was  then why are you still going out looking for him  i dont know  thats puke  those douchebags in the vines  took themselves out  holding hands  kumbaya style  they wanted to go out together same as they lived  that make them douchebags  it does if they could have gotten out  everybody makes it till they dont  people nowadays are dominoes  what they did maybe its about not having to watch them fall  right  come on  we got about all were gonna get here  we should move on  so did we pass your test  were in a prison eight miles north  if you come back with us we cant guarantee your safety  theres an illness a flu  its bad  weve lost a lot   kids too  yours  no thank god  but one of my girls shes got it   im sorry  shes strong shell make it  you got fences and walls   were

greenhouse  see if its clear bring back more fruit  and i can hit some of the houses  well its nice of you to offer  but your shoulders barely  as long as i dont put too much weight on this arm im

righty or a lefty  well cover more ground  the sooner we get back  you cant carry us man   it doesnt work that way  please we want to help  you fire a shot well come running  lets meet back here in two hours  youll need this  you never told us about the group you were with before  which one  you know when you found me out on that road  i almost kept walking  why is that  cause i was done being a witness  two times two different groups  i was the last one standing  like i was supposed to see it happen over and over  like its some kind of curse  but when its just you out there with the quiet  used to be id drink a bottle of anything  just so i could shut my eyes at night  figured the prison the people thought itd be easier  the run to the big spot i did it for me  you gotta keep busy  no i did it so i could get me a bottle  of anything  i picked it up i held it in my hand  but i put it down  i put it down so hard it took the whole damn shelf with it  thats what brought on the walkers  and thats what got zack killed  thats bullshit  why dont you get in there and try the engine  its a red and a green wire  go on it aint rocket science  give it some gas  sasha and me picked that spot  he took you with us  there aint no way anybody couldve known  you aint gonna be standing alone  not no more lets go  its all expired by at least a year  better to take it let herschel decide what he needs  did you think it was right  letting those kids come back with us  i think it was the humane thing to do  but did you think it was right  look at us  digging through drawers  hoping that a couple of cough drops  and some disinfectant might be the difference  between dying and living a couple of more hours  if theyre strong enough to help us survive this thing  yeah i think you made the right call  and if theyre not  lets hope they are  yeah  rick  i killed two people and you havent said a word about it  what do you want me to say  its not about what you say  its about facing reality  it always comes for us and over and over again  we face it so that we can live   so that we can live  thats right  thats what it always comes down to  you can be a farmer rick  you cant just be a farmer  youre a good leader  better than i probably gave you credit for  i never murdered two of our own  just one  he was gonna kill me  so were they  they were gonna kill all of us  you dont know that  if you thought it would save judith or carl  would you have done it then or would you have just gone back to your crops  and hoped itd all be okay  you dont have to like what i did rick  i dont you just accept it  looks like were getting closer  the building we want is just up ahead  come on come on  move move  all right lets make this quick  there you go  come on  lets hit the houses across the street  hold on  howd you put his shoulder back before  you learn that from herschel  internet  its easier than telling an er nurse  id fallen down the stairs a third time  im sorry  dont be just fixed what needed fixin  i actually convinced myself i was happy with him  which wasnt all that hard to do  considering my idea of happiness then  was just not being alone  made a decent living  he was charming when he wanted to be  especially those mornings after hed come home pissdrunk and  stupid  stupid  i didnt think i could be strong  i didnt know i could  i already was  why dont you say her name  shes dead rick  sophia dead  somebody elses slideshow  some mornings i still wake up  halfexpecting lori to be there  reminding me to pick up carl after school  or telling me breakfast is

kind of family  that ate pancakes on sunday  we should get back  sams probably waiting  anything ending with cillin or cin  cin grab it  well dissolve the pills in the ivs  put em right into the bloodstream  dosage will be tricky but considering the time we lost   howd you do  bags tubes clamps connectors   everything on the list  what about yall  yeah we got it all  yeah were good  all right lets roll  whoa whoa whoa whoa  up ahead  hey doors busted  oh hold up  there   how many  i cant tell   we can take em  no theyre infected same as at the prison  we fire at em get their blood on us
