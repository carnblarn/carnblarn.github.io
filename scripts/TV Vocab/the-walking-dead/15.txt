whispering  what happened that night  you havent been the same since   whispering  you wanna know what happened with otis  what happened with otis happened because i love you  i love you and i love carl thats right  i told rick  what  you told you told him what  did you tell him that you thought you were a widow  that you were grieving and that the world was coming to an end  that that you needed comforting  did you tell him it was a mistake  you know lori that aint true  what we had   it was real  it was not   it was a long time coming it was real lori  it was not  it was you and it was me  and carl and it was real  it was right dont say it wasnt   it wasnt  yeah  just think about what you felt  just for a second what you fe what you felt  everything falling apart all around us

dad was here  shell be okay  you just need to be strong for her  i was just reminding her about   never mind  no no  i id love to hear  my dad would die if he heard this  my first summer back from college  i drove home dumped my stuff off  went straight out to the stable for a ride  my family comes back from church  and beth grabs my things and starts unpacking my stuff upstairs   thats sweet  yeah until this one here  starts rifling through my backpack  she finds this little plastic container  with these pink and green candies inside  she didnt even know i was on the pill  she was so freaked out by the idea of me and boys and sex  she runs outside and chucks them in the duck pond  and i ride up i see this im screaming  shes crying and shawn runs outside  thinks one of us is drowning  soon as he figures out whats going on  the jerk busts out laughing so loud  that my horse rears up and gets mud all over the three of us  my dad comes out what the hecks goin on out here  and she turns around  bats her eyelids and says were just swimming daddy  in her sunday dress all covered in snot and mud  rick and glenn will get your dad back  glenns a good guy  yeah he is  are you sure you wanna risk it  you might not make it back   ill be fine  and with shane at the helm  i wouldnt be too sure hes lost people before  and hes had my back what are you insinuating  he doesnt want rick back  or hershel  with them gone hes got everything he wants  and no one to tell him otherwise  shane has done more to keep this group alive  than anybody including rick  you cant possibly believe that  i do   sighs   guys   engine stops   dad  youre okay  patricia prepare the shed for surgery   are you hurt  no but what happened to you   i was in a car accident  accident how   i went looking for you  snuck out on her own brought her back   are you crazy you couldve  who the hell is that  thats randall  rick we couldnt just leave him behind  he wouldve bled out  if he lived that long  its gotten bad in town  what do we do with him  i repaired his calf muscle as best i can  but hell probably have nerve damage  wont be on his feet for at least a week  when he is we give him a canteen  take him out to the main road send him on his way  andrea isnt that the same as leaving him for the walkers  rick hell have a fighting chance  shane just gonna let him go   he knows where we are  he was blindfolded the whole way here   hes not a threat  shane not a threat how many of them were there  you killed three of t zir men you took one of them hostage   but they just aint gonna come looking  they left him for dead   no one is looking  we should still post a guard  hes out cold right now will be for hours  you know what im gonna go get him some flowers and candy   scoffs  look at this folks we back in fantasy land  you know we havent even dealt with what you did at my barn yet  let me make this perfectly clear once and for all  this is my farm now i wanted you gone  rick talked me out of it but that doesnt mean i have to like it  so do us both a favor keep your mouth shut   sighs   were not gonna do anything about it today  lets just cool off  can i talk to you  whats going on with you   sighs   your dad saved my life today  and rick saved us both  and i  i froze  well you were being shot at  i know but   you dont have anything to prove  all ive done  then this okay  its because of what you said  that i love you  yeah  a bullet hit the wall behind me  and i i thought of you  losing me hurting  and i couldnt take it so i hid  to stay alive   glenn  no no no  no you dont get it  rick your dad they were counting on me  and i i only thought of myself  has she eaten  ill give her a sedative  stop her body from working too hard  you were drinking  that was the least of my worries  you left and i didnt know what to do   want me to take watch   sighs  yeah  relieve t in a few hours im gonna take the graveyard  and then what  we just send him on his merry way   scoffs  according to rick and hershel  if he finds his people and leads them here  well have a war on our hands  you know youre preaching to the choir girl  you ever consider a lighter touch  abandoning the search for sophia  taking out the walkers in the barn lying to lori today  those were all the right calls  its your presentation that leaves something to be desired  dale send you  i see you pushing everyone away  for what they need you  huh ill always be the odd man out   the same as you  ive made my peace  have you the way i see it  you and me we were treated the same way  everyones always trying to take the gun out of your hand  these folks they want to play house  they wanna pretend that rick and hershel  they know what theyre doing lemme tell you something  they bound to get us all killed   then we have to stop that  they dont listen  theyre gonna give this kid a care package  theyre gonna send him on his way and you right  thats gonna bring on a war or something worse  and we just gonna were gonna sit here and wait for it  but you and me we  were the only ones who see it coming  i shouldve left with you when i had the chance  oh oh man  here  thank you ah   both laugh    lori chuckles  need your help  come here   were like a couple of old people   laughs   we need to talk about shane   sighs   whats he done now  he thinks the babys his  no matter what its yours   sighs   hell accept that  youre gonna have to make him he wont listen to me  hes delusional and hes dangerous  when i went looking for you he came after me   well of course he did  and lied to me  to get me back here said you were already back  you saw what he did at the barn  hes threatened dale and hershel  hes scaring people and hes scaring me  and i think he killed otis  i think he left him behind and i think  i think he did it not just to save carl   but because he loves me  but you dont know that  and he thinks that were supposed to be together  no matter what  those gunmen left that kid behind today  i killed two people myself because of you  and carl and the baby  it was gonna be me and not them no matter what  you killed the living to protect whats yours  thats right  shane thinks im his  he thinks the babys his  and he says you cant protect us  that youre gonna get us killed  hes dangerous rick and he wont stop
