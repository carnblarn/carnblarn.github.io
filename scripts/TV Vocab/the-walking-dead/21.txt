sit tight threw me this piece said hed be right back  yeah and that was 292 days ago   94 according to my calcula  shut up  we were thinking that the army or the national guard  should be showing up any day now  there is no army  what do you mean  theres no government no hospitals no police  its all gone   for real  im serious  what about my moms  my kids and my old lady  yo you got a cell phone or something that we can call our families  you just dont get it do you  no phones no computers  as far as we can see at leas half the population has been wiped out  probably more   aint no way  see for yourself  damn the sun feels good  good lord theyre all dead  never thought id be so happy to see these fences  you never said  how the hell did you get in here in the first place  cut a hole in that fence over there by that guard tower   that easy huh  where theres a will theres a way  easy for you to say  so what is this like a disease  yeah and were all infected  what do you mean infected like aids or something  if i was to kill you shoot an arrow in your chest  youd come back as one of these things  its gonna happen to all of us  aint no way this robinhood casts  responsible for killing all these freaks  must be 50 bodies out here  whered you come from  atlanta  where are you headed  for now nowhere  i guess you can take that area down there near the water  should be comfortable  were using that field for crops   well help you move your gear out  that wont be necessary  we took out these walkers this prison is ours  slow down cowboy  you snatched the locks off our doors  well give you new locks if thats how you want it  this is our prison we were here first  locked in a broom closet  we took it set you free  its ours we spilled blood   were moving back into our cell block  youll have to get your own  it is mine ive still got personal artifacts in there   thats about as mine as it gets  whoa whoa whoa  maybe lets try to make this work out so everybody wins   i dont see that happening  neither do i  i aint going back in that cafeteria for one more minute  there are other cell blocks  you could leave  try your luck out on the road  if these three pussies can do all this  the least we can do is take out another cell block  with what  atlanta here will spot us some real weapons  wont you boss  how stocked is that cafeteria  it must have plenty of food  five guys lasting almost a year  it sure as hell dont look like anybodys been starving   theres only a little left  well take half  in exchange well help clear out a cell block  didnt you hear him theres only a little left  bet you got more food than you got choices  you pay well play  well clear out a block for you then you keep to it   all right  well lets be clear  if we see you out here anywhere near our people  if i so much as even catch a whiff of your scent  i will kill you  deal  it has to stop eventually right  it slowed down quite a bit already  if we can get him through this  when we get him through this  well need crutches  right now we could use some antibiotics  and painkillers some sterile gauze  theres got to be an infirmary here  if there is well find it  youve gotta be worried sick about delivering the baby  look at me do i look worried  you look disgusting  so do you  well get through this  pantrys back here  you never tried to break out of here  yeah we tried to take the doors off  but if you make one peep in here  then those freaksll be lined up outside the door  growling trying to get in  windows got bars on there that heman couldnt get through   bigger than a 5x8  you wont find me complaining  doing 15 my left leg can barely fit on one of those bunks  yeah they dont call him big tiny for nothing  you done jerking each other off  sick of waiting back here  this what you call a little bit of food   goes fast  mmhmm  you can have a bag of corn some tuna fish  we said half thats the deal   whats in there  dont open that  he wanted to know  cant wait for my own pot to piss in  it was stupid of us to let him go  we cleared this whole cell block just the five of us  it could have happened to anyone  what are we gonna do without him  hey stop it  all right stop it  hes still here  what if he does wake up  then what he cant even walk  all we do is run  hey  this wont break him  okay  hes got you and beth  am i the only person living in reality here  weve been through so much already  youre expecting it too  im not expecting all right  im just preparing  why dont you go check on beth  go on ill watch him   what are you doing  hes gonna have a hard time walking around  with one side of his pants dragging on the ground  you know he could trip or something  theres a good chance he wont wake up   why are you so eager to give up on him  im not giving up on him  it sure sounds like it  i dont want you to get your hopes too high  were not equipped to deal with something like this   we have carol  shes not a doctor  dad taught her a few things to help with the baby  she stopped the bleeding  thesell do just fine   foods here  what you got  canned beef canned corn canned cans  theres a lot more where this came from  any change  bleeding is under control and no fever  but his breath is labored and his pulse is way down  and he hasnt opened his eyes yet  take my cuffs put them on him  im not taking any chances  yeah  so what about those prisoners  were gonna help them  clear out their own cell block  and then theyll be there and well be here   living beside each other  im not giving up this prison   do they have guns  i only saw one  yeah i dont know if its gonna work  well what are your options  kill them  if thats what you think is best  you s you say this now  look i know that im a shitty wife  and im not winning any mother of the year awards  but i need you to know that  not for one second do i think there is malice in your heart  youre not a killer and i know that  i know that so  so do whatever you gotta do to keep this group safe  and do it with a clear conscience  why do i need this when i got this  you dont fire guns  not unless your backs up against a wall  noise attracts them  it really riles them up  well go in two by two daryl will run point with t  ill bring up the rear with you  stay tight hold formation  no matter how close the walkers get  anyone breaks ranks we could all go down  anyone runs off  they could get mistaken for a walker  end up with an axe to the head  and thats where you aim  these things only go down with a head shot  aint gotta tell us how to take out a man  they aint men theyre something else  just remember to go for the brain  whats going on   we had to  its just a precaution  you think maybe i could have a minute alone here  yeah you want me to  no just by myself  of course  ill be right outside  dad  you dont have to fight anymore  if youre worried about me and beth dont  dont worry about us  well take care of each other well look out  me beth and glenn will look out  go ahead dad its okay  be peaceful  you dont have to fight  if its time to go its okay  daddy i just want to thank you  for everything thank you  man its too damn dark in here  gotta hold it up high out in front of you  youre gonna hear them before you see them   its coming  shh  you wanna taste me  i thought you were organizing the food  even better  check it out  where did you get this  from the infirmary  wasnt much left but i cleared it out   you went by yourself  yeah  are you crazy  no big deal i killed two walkers  you all right do you see this  this was with the whole group  we needed supplies so i got them   i appreciate that but  then get off my back  carl  shes your mother you cant talk to her like that  listen i think its great that you wanna help  its gotta be the brain  not the stomach not the heart the brain  i hear you the brain   like that  uhhuh  stay in tight formation no more prison riot crap  ah  these bandages will help prevent infection  its good  its good that he taught you all this stuff  he didnt teach me everything  i need your help with something   now  yeah now   what is it  not here  i cant leave hershel   this is important  carol i cant   go on we got it  no way   well be fine  were not gonna be gone long   rick said for me  were fine  all right  im telling you i dont feel anything its just a scratch   im sorry man  i can keep fighting  you

we could just lock him up  quarantine him  we gotta do something why you just standing there   we gotta save him  theres nothing we can do  you son of a bitch  im all ri  that one  everything youre saying is completely sane  youre wanting to use a walker for practice is a sane thing  i mean it okay  im just im just trying to wrap my mind around it  loris overdue  she had carl by csection  shes probably gonna have to have this one the same way  hershel had a little bit of experience with this kind of thing  but hes not gonna be able to do it anymore  i need experience  and we have plenty of cadavers  all right well like i said its completely sane  i need to learn how to cut through  the abdomen and the uterus without cutting the baby  why not  ill do it  okay  come on hey follow me come
