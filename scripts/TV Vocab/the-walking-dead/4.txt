                previously on amcs the walking dead  dad  you handcuffed my brother to a roof  and you let him there  it seems to me what you really need most here are more guns  i dropped the bag in atlanta when i got swarmed  im going back  you just got here and youre gonna turn around and leave  merle merle no no   what  nothing  its not nothing its always something  didnt dad teach you to tie nail knots  why would he do that he only ever used a fishermans knot   one knot  no he didnt  no he tied at least three  clinch knots  no way  fine im making it up  did dad teach you mostly dry lures  yeah you   wet  youre kidding  but he was always so adamant  i mean you know dad on the fishing thing  gee you think  i only spent my entire childhood with my ass in a boat  but in my day it was all about getting the hook seated  we were fishing for the dinner table  not us we always threw them back   always  i guess he changed things up  but thatd be like changing his religion or something  people change its not his fault we were born 12 years apart  no  no because the minute you went off to college  it was my ass in that boat and he taught me dry lures from day one  this was not behavior developed over time  you think he did it for us  because he knew we were so different  he knew that you needed to catch the fish  and i needed to throw them back  all right remember his rule  no crying in the boat  it scares the fish  mom and dad  i mean  maybe florida wasnt hit so bad  maybe its better there  do you think  i think you have a bite  even with the wrong knots  oh god  so much for the no crying rule  i think that was more for dad than the fish    i wont hesitate i dont care if every walker in the city hears it  you got a dorag or something  i guess the saw blade was too dull for the handcuffs  aint that a bitch  he must have used a tourniquet maybe his belt  be much more blood if he didnt  merle you in here  jim you okay  you keep this up youre gonna keel over out here  drink some water at least  had enough in him to take out these two sumbitches  one handed  toughest asshole i ever met my brother  feed him a hammer hed crap out nails  any man can pass out from blood loss  no matter how tough he is  oh baby will you look at that  hey check it out  ladies  because of you my children will eat tonight   thank you  thank dale  its his canoe and gear  mom

faith hes lost a lot of blood  yeah  didnt stop him from busting out of this death trap  he left the building  why the hell would he do that  why wouldnt he  hes out there alone as far as he knows  doing what hes got to do  surviving  you call that surviving  just wandering out in the streets maybe passing out  what are his odds out there  no worse than being handcuffed and left to rot by you

come on man  my people got attacked  wheres the compensation for their pain and suffering  more to the point wheres my bag of guns   guns  the bag miguel saw in the street  the bag felipe and jorge were going back to get   that bag of guns  youre mistaken   i dont think so  about it being yours  its my bag of guns  the bag was in the street  anybody could come around and say it was theirs  im supposed to take your word  whats to stop my people from unloading on you  right here and now and i take whats mine  you could do that  or not  come on man make the trade  please  oye  i see two options  you come back with miguel and my bag of guns  everybody walks  or you come back locked and loaded  well see which side spills more blood  them guns are worth more than gold  gold wont protect your family or put food on the table  youre gonna give that up for that kid  if i knew wed get glenn back i might agree  but you think that vato across the way is just gonna hand him over   you calling g a liar  are you a part of this  you want to hold onto your teeth  question is do you trust that mans word  no question is what are you willing to bet on it  could be more than them guns could be your life  glenn worth that to you  what life i have i owe to him  i was nobody to glenn  just some idiot stuck in a tank  he could have walked away but he didnt  neither will i  so youre gonna hand the guns over  i didnt say that  theres nothing keeping you two here  you should get out head back to camp  and tell your family what  come on this is nuts  just do like g says  i see my guns but theyre not all in the bag  thats because theyre not yours  i thought i mentioned that  lets just shoot these fools right now ese  all right unload on their asses ese  i dont think you fully appreciate the gravity of the situation  no im pretty clear  you have your man i want mine  im gonna chop up your boy im gonna feed him to my dogs  theyre the evilest nastiest maneating bitches you

blood would be on my hands  mine too wed have fought back  wouldnt be the first time weve had to  protect the food the medicine whats left of it  these people the old ones  the staff took off just left em here to die  me and felipe were the only ones who stayed  what are you doctors  felipes a nurse a special care provider  me  im the custodian  what about the rest of your crew  the vatos trickle in  to check on their parents their grandparents  they see how things are and most decide to stay  its a good thing too we need the muscle  the people weve encountered since things fell apart  the worst kind plunderers  the kind that take by force   thats not who we are  how was i to know  my people got attacked and you show up with miguel hostage  appearances  guess the world changed  no  its the same as it ever was the weak get taken  so we do what we can here  the vatos work on those cars  talk about getting the old people out of the city  but most cant even get to the bathroom by themselves  still it keeps the crew busy  and thats worth something  so we barred all the windows  welded all the doors shut except for one entrance  the vatos they go out  scavenge what they can to keep us going  we watch the perimeter night and day and we wait  the people here  they all look to me now  i dont even know why  because they can  admit it you only came back to atlanta for the hat  dont tell anybody  youve given away half our guns and ammo   not nearly half  for what  bunch of old farts who are gonna die off momentarily anyhow  seriously how long you think they got  how long do
