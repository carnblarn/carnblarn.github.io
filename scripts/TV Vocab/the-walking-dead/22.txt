on your way out the front gates  andrea show us the way  youve kept us locked up in this room  you see any bars on the windows  youre being cared for  under guard  to protect our people we dont know you  we know enough about you to want out of this place  we watched you drive a knife into the skulls of two dead men  what the hell was that all about  they turned  they werent bitten  doesnt matter  however we die we all turn  i put them out of their misery  its not easy news to swallow at first but there it is  youre not prisoners here youre guests  but if you wanna leave as i said youre free to do so  but we dont open the gates past dusk  draws too much attention  and you especially you need a solid nights sleep  you wouldnt last another day out there in your condition  have you brought over to my place in the morning  return your weapons  extra ammo food for the road  some meds keys to a vehicle if you want one  send you on your way no hard feelings  welcome to woodbury  come with me  go relieve pete at the back gate  ill take the spotlight  are you military  hardly couple of vets  but by and large were selftrained  thats heavy artillery theyre packing  some men arrive with guns  but most of the weapons are scavenged over time  and the other side of town the rest of the streets  theyre all guarded like this  it cant be  it can  and it is  got us a creeper governor  may i  thank you  governor they call you that  some nicknames stick whether you want them to or not  andrea buzz is a nickname governor is a title  theres a difference  merle got him  he brought his buddies  clear  well get them in the morning  cant leave them to rot  creates an odor makes people uneasy  what people theres nobody here  its a ghost town  this way  youll be more comfortable here  not the four seasons but theres a hot shower  waters limited so keep it short  weve got food water fresh clothes  hope this works  i know youd feel better with your sword  more secure but youre safe here  we appreciate it  what about the pilot will he make it  well dr stevens is doing all she can  now i know you got a lot more questions but i got work to do  my man will be outside the door if you need anything else  ill see you tomorrow  andrea its real  you two were out there for a long time  while you were the governor was doing this  andrea how many people do you have here   eileens about to pop so her kid will make it 74  its still a work in progress  but rome wasnt built in a day  thats a bold comparison  i think weve earned it  walls havent been breached in well over a month  we havent suffered a casualty on the inside since early winter  andrea hows that possible  woman our governor set a strict curfew  nobody out after dark  noise and light are kept to the bare minimum  armed guards on the fence and patrolling the perimeter to keep the biters away  i saw what your patrols do on the way in last night  they had a dead one strung up like an ornament  i wont make excuses  those men put their lives at risk every day  to protect this town  theyve lost more than a few friends out there  everybody copes in their own way  but ill raise it with the governor  things were orderly  the fences held  people were protected food and supplies were lasting  then one of the men inside got bit  not sure how  he went haywire  panic swept through the camp  someone opened the gate to escape  others were bitten and infected  those people went crazy  the whole place went to hell in a few hours  my team grabbed whatever supplies and vehicles we could  and abandoned our post  how many of you escaped  maybe it was 10 in my group  we got maybe 60 miles from the post  before getting jammed up on the highway  i took the bird up in the air to scout ahead  she took a beating in the riot but we had no choice  my guys  no  let me go find the rest  bring them here where theyll be safe  theyre out there waiting for you  exposed  tell me where they are and i promise  if theyre still alive  ill bring em in  did you finish your homework  unfortunately the dogs eating it already  what the hell you call me  hey where are we back in the school yard  well do you want to uh take his lunch money while youre at it  sorry governor  maybe ive wasted my time  maybe you havent learned anything at all   he was trying to smoke in here  and you expect better  keep poking the bear and youre bound to get mauled  remember that  tell me about the girl   names andrea  you know her  shes from that group in atlanta  yeah  same one left me on the roof  forced me to mutilate myself   does she know your brother daryl  yeah she did  then talk to her again  see what else you can find out  show me something  what do you make of it  oh pretty impressive really  major kudos for ingenuity  take away their arms so they cant grab you  take away their jaws so they cant bite you  take away their ability to eat  they lose interest in doing so  theyre no longer in attack mode  we can be in their presence without threat  theyre they become docile in a sense  lurkers  mm docile  or lurkers you know whatever you like  why keep em  ah repellent  camouflage  walk with the biters  they think youre a biter  low profile thats smart  theyre still pretty thin  if theyre not eating why dont they starve  they are starving  they just do it slower than we do  feels like were trying to impose logic on a chaos  that is not a bad thing  no but what does it buy us more questions more theories  no answers  not yet  if i could talk to those women  merles handling it  i dont want to question your judgment governor  sure you do  thats why i need you  that and your tea  ah  well then  with all due respect  letting merle talk to those women  unsupervised is a mistake  now youve always said every tool kit needs a hammer  but do you really feel the hammer is the right tool for that job  eight months  hard to believe you ladies lasted so long out there  because were women  because you were alone  we had each other  two against the world  its long odds  we managed   oh were impressed  very  survival in the wild is tough sledding  wake up every morning on the ground wondering  if today is the day  will it be quick and final  or slow and well without end  if someone had the good sense to kill my brain  or will i come back as one of them  do you think they remember anything  the person they once were  i dont think about it  milton believes there might be a trace of the person they were  still trapped inside  like an echo  surely it must have crossed your mind  at one time yeah  right before it tried to bite me  milton and then you killed it  i say it only because no one here  likes to refer to them as him  or her  the two you had in chains who were they  the way you controlled them  used them to your benefit  you did know them didnt you  let them eat  my apologies  so what you have here you expect it to hold  what if a herd comes through  itll hold  whats your secret  really big walls  that soldier had walls too  and we all know how that turned out so  i guess we do  the real secret is what goes on within these walls  its about getting back to who we were  who we really are  theyre just waiting to be saved  and people here have homes medical care  kids go to school adults have jobs to do  theres a sense of purpose were a community  with a lot of guns and ammunition   never hurts  and really big walls  and men willing to risk everything to defend them  compromise our safety destroy our community  ill die before ill let that happen  looks like youre sitting pretty at the end of the world  do i strike you as the kind of man that sits pretty  you reap what you sow  were the seed  now winter has passed its time to harvest  time to hope  were going out there and were taking back whats ours  civilization  we will rise again  only this time we wont be eating each other  to civilization then  excuse me  hows the tea  sorry to cut breakfast short but this cant wait  we want our weapons  well we can make these meals to go and your weapons will be waiting outside  but you should take time to relax  get your strength back  have a look around who knows  you might like what you see  i dont trust him  why not  have you ever trusted anybody  yeah  then give this a day or two thats all im asking  some time to get our shit together  my shit never stopped being together  didnt look that way when milton asked about your walkers  im surprised he didnt get a fork in his eye  it was none of his damn business  i guess its none of mine either  seven months together all weve been through  i still feel like i hardly know you  im sorry its the truth come on you know everything about me   and i  you know enough  those walkers were with us all winter long  protecting us and you took them out without any hesitation   and that had  it was easier than you think  vehicle approaching corporal  all right stay alert  hey hey hey hey dont shoot  identify yourself  hey hey hey hey we found your guy  wells lieutenant wells  his chopper went down  where is he  we got a little settlement now hes badly hurt  but hes alive  the other guys didnt make it im sorry  but wells he told me i would find you here  wants me to bring you to him  they found wells they got him they found him  we sure did we found you too  never waste a bullet son  pick up the rest of these weapons  yes sir  go put a merciful end to that young mans days  lets see what uncle sam brought us shall we  we brought in three new people yesterday  one was a helicopter pilot with a national guard outfit  even though hes clinging to life  he told us about his convoy on the highway  his men  i promised id bring them back here alive  but they didnt have our walls or our fences  biters got there before we did  now the men had trucks the trucks had weapons food medicines things we need  now we didnt know them  but well honor their sacrifice  by not taking what we have here for granted  wont be long before dark so go on home  be thankful for what you have  watch out for each other  youre still here   anything i can do  no not for tonight  long day  havent had many short ones lately  good night  so whats your real name  if its not asking too much  i never tell  never say never  never
