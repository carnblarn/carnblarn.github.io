broadcasting  what did it say  couldnt make it out  i only know because im seeing it now  those who arrive survive  we should go  i thought we were looking for glenn  if he saw one of these  he would go looking for me looking for him  look at this map all these tracks  from different directions leading to the same place  its far  and we dont know if there are other signs  you dont think this is the only one  this is the best lead weve had so far  it says sanctuary thats just another reason to try  others from the prison could be there tyreese  if it sounds too good to be true  maybe if glenn saw one of these maybe he felt the same way  he wouldnt hed believe i know  what do you want to do sasha  keep making these circles from the bus  or are you talking about us starting to do something

 the first one we see we find a building  some higher ground to set up in  all of us  thats what we need to do  thats what were gonna do  if we can talk her into it  just think about it  dang  you find anything  whoa  peanut butter and jelly  diet soda and pigs feet  thats a white trash brunch right there  it all looks good to me  no hold up  aint a speck of dust on this  so  that means

 there aint no jukebox so  and well buy   a beer to shotgun   well lay on the lawn   and well be good   now im laughing at my boredom   and my string of failed attempts   bob    bob  come on shes got to follow the tracks  we can still catch up to her  sasha we can still catch up to her  you have been grinning since we left the prison in one piece  if youre so happy to be alive  then why are we walking into the heart of darkness  its not about me being alive  do you even know why youre smiling  oh yeah  im not alone  thats how it happened when i lost my first group  and my second group  i broke that streak  youd be smiling too  selfawareness is a beautiful thing  you should try it sometime   oh youre not going to take the bait  nope  youre just as bullheaded as she is sometimes  you

hell are we doing out here  why do you think tyreese is dead   what  if tyreese were alive hed go for terminus  i know you know that  so why do you think hes dead  or are you just too afraid to find

look for food  maybe even try to grow some up there  sasha im not stopping  we are  im not  shes out there alone  she didnt want us to come  she made her choice for her  i dont care  shes alone  when i got to the prison i thought to myself  how long the clocks ticking  how long until everyone else is dead and im on my own  bad things happened cause i was scared  they didnt need to i didnt need to be afraid  now we get to terminus and tyreese isnt there  it doesnt mean hes dead   you dont need to be afraid  i am not afraid  so this is it  it doesnt have to be  thats right  im gonna try something here  well okay  you dont have to do it  you dont have to be alone again  i wont be  maggie  oh shit  wheres bob  out looking for you  why are you here  i was looking for another walker  found more than i wanted  you know i was lying there  and i remembered  i heard what you said back at the camp  i heard you say you thought we should  be in a town  what else did you hear me say  that odds are glenn is dead  and we should stop  but youre wrong  so why are you here  cause i was waiting for you  im not giving up  but i need your help  cause i cant do it by myself  and even if i catch up to bob  we cant do it alone  i thought that i couldnt ask you to risk your life  but i can  cause i know what youd be risking it for  and it isnt just glenn  i get that youre afraid  i am  i am afraid  we could get there  i know  so lets go get bob  and lets get there  well lookit here  damn it hold up  im claiming the vest  i like them wings  hold up  a bowman  i respect that  see a man
