infection  might even bring down your fever  what do you think  three days out four days  we havent seen any of those maps at the crossings  im not sure  lizzies tough  when it comes to people  what do you mean  you havent seen it  how shes confused about them the walkers  she doesnt see what they are  she thinks theyre just different  mica the same way  no shes worse  she doesnt have a mean bone in her body  did tom sawyer have a happy ending  we never got to finish it  well tom and huck  they stop injun joe and his partner  and wind up getting all his gold   so they wind up rich  mmhmm  and the widow douglas adopts huck  like you adopted us  yeah just like the widow douglas  and im huck finn  i think youre more like tom sawyer  yeah youre right  youre way more like huck finn  youre not even grossed out by dead rabbits  forgot you used to read to them  i did   you smell that  yeah  theres a fire somewhere  must be a big one it isnt anywhere around here  we should stop here we need to look for water  i can do it  no you need to rest rest your arm  mica will help me  i spy trees and weeds  your turn  here you stay here  tyreese  sometimes we have to kill them  i know that but sometimes we dont  you know lizzie can carry a lot more than me  i had you come because i wanted to talk to you  why  because youre little and youre sweet  and those are two things that can get you killed  you cant change how big you are  i wish i could  but you can toughen up  i dont have to be tough  i can run im good at that  no  my daughter ran and it wasnt enough  thats why i taught the kids at the prison to do more than that  i can kill walkers  i mean ive tried  im not like my sister im not messed up  i know what they are  but i cant kill people  i could never do that  when the bad people were at the prison  they were right in front of us  and i held up my gun  but i couldnt pull the trigger  killing people is wrong  someone killed karen and david  they just killed them they were nice  what about people who try to kill you  i dont even wish i could  people came in and killed our friends  and i feel sorry for them  why  because they probably werent like that before  sooner or later youre gonna have to do it  youll have to do it or youll die  so youre gonna change the way you think about it  you have to change everyone does now  things dont just work out  look  my mom used to say everything works out the way its supposed to  what are these   pecans  oh i love pecans  you know maybe we could catch our breath here for a while  were still going to terminus right  well just stay a day or two  theres a well full of water  fences  theyre not big but theyre something  and we saw deer they eat pecans  we should be able to kill one to eat  we can eat these too right  you can eat your fill and then some  look  bet thats what we were smelling  looks far enough away  i wonder how it started  maybe lightning maybe a campfire  i can patch that fence  its probably where the deer are coming from  we should leave it just play it really safe in here  if theres one in there its not moving much  lets just stay close go slow room to room  girls you sit tight  you dont come in until we come out no matter what you hear   okay  okay  lizzies got judith mica get out your gun  youre gonna need to stand watch  stand strong little lady  theyre gonna be okay  its not that  is it

gotta  you do  lizzies bigger than you and in some ways shes stronger  but youre smarter  and you understand these things  youve got to look out for her  you have to  no go ahead you do it  just like i showed you at the prison go ahead  i cant  we have peaches  maybe we dont need to go to terminus  ive been thinking  micas right  we can stay here  we can live here  i know lizzie and mica  i know

we were just pretending things werent bad  things are bad  those things theyre bad they are  we cant pretend anymore  im not pretending you were  i know i can hear them  they want to kill you  they just want me to change  they can make me be like them  maybe i should change  stop it  i can make you all understand  lizzie  lizzie theyre coming lizzie  carol  help  help carol lizzie   lizzie  mica

no no  now we have a lot of pecans here  a ton   you getting sick of them yet  nope  i used to make these with my grandma when i was little  they smell good  there you go all right  i think you guys are ready to start doing the cooking around here  who wants to put em in  me  the girls like it here  we could build it up plant more food  we could find a car for an escape route just in case  if you dont want to go to terminus we could stay  we could  it doesnt mean we cant go someday  its just  when we were getting closer and closer  i realized  im just not ready to be around other people yet  you dont have to  i dream about karen  i see her every night  and every time i forget shes dead  sometimes  we just talk  and sometimes  i see her in the crowd  in a city ive never been to  and its back before everything happened  and then  some nights the bad ones  i see someone kill her  some stranger  then i lose her all over again  but thats the deal right  the people who are living are haunted by the dead  we are who we are  and we do what we do  cause theyre still here  in our heads  in the forest  the whole world is haunted now  and theres no getting out of that  not until were dead  tyreese  maybe theyre not haunting us  maybe theyre just teaching us  helping remind us so  so that we can live with what we have to do  hey  dont you ever be ashamed of who you are carol  you did right by those girls  you did right by everyone  well get one yet  probably not even deer season  my husband used to hunt  hed tell the same stupid joke every year  you gonna tell it  well i guess i have to now right  you do  okay  whats the difference between beer nuts and deer nuts  beer nuts are around 179  deer nuts are just under a buck  thats good stupid  but in no way is it stupid good  yeah i told you theres more where that came from  dont worry shell come back  i didnt hurt her brain  no no no we have to wait  i need to show you youll see  youll finally get it we have to wait  lizzie put the gun down  i just want us to wait  we can wait  we can wait you just give me the gun  we can wait i swear  you and tyreese should take judith back  its not safe for her  but judith can change too   i was just about to  she cant even walk yet  yeah youre right  so you two take judith back to the house  and well have lunch  and ill just tie mica up  you know just so she wont go anywhere  promise thats what youll do  mmhmm  i promise  ill use her shoelaces  lets lets go lizzie  i brought her some food  cleared out her room  made sure she didnt have any knives  anything like that  she has a shoe box full of mice  i asked her if she was the one feeding the walkers at the prison  that was her  and at the tombs  we found this rabbit  pulled apart and nailed to a board  that was her too  said she was just having fun  i was thinking  maybe she killed karen and david  but i dont know how she could drag them away  she would have let them turn  it wasnt her  so what do we do  i could leave with her  what  we cant sleep with her and judith under the same roof  you wouldnt make it not on your own  she cant be around other people  maybe we could try to help her  talk her back somehow  this is how she is  it was already there  i didnt see it   how could you  i should have seen it  so maybe we go  me and judith  you wont make it either  she cant be around other people  you should pick some wildflowers for mica  to give her when she comes back  yeah shed love that  the fires still burning  no  the smokes white  its out  you know everything maam  no i dont  what is it  what is it  are you mad at me  is that what you wanted to talk to me about  im sorry i pointed my gun at you  i just needed you to wait  i know  im sorry  youre mad at me  i love you lizzie  and everything works out the way its supposed to  im sorry  please dont be mad at me  im sorry  you just just look at the flowers lizzie  just look at the flowers  just just look at the flowers  i killed karen and david  i had to stop the illness from breaking out  i had to stop other people from dying  it wasnt lizzie  it wasnt a stranger  tyreese it was me  you do what you have to do  did she know what was happening  was she scared  it was quick  yes  do what you have to do  i forgive you  im never gonna forget  it happened  you did it  you feel it  i know you do  its a part of you now  me too  but i forgive you  thank you  we dont need to stay  we cant stay  im not afraid to kill  im just afraid  you cant be  how  you fight  and fight it  you dont give up  and then one day  you just change  we all change
