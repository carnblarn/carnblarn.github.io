anyone going out alone we stay in pairs  ill take suggestions on a partner  see how they do on the range then take your pick  thanks  my binoculars  yeah yeah  okay bye  wed like to join you for gun training today  hershels been very clear  i cant involve any of you in what we do without his okay  he doesnt like it but he consented  otis was the only one who knew guns  now that hes gone  we gotta learn to protect ourselves  her father saw the sense in that  no offense but ill ask hershel myself  dude nice lid man  whats going on  i want to learn to shoot too  can you teach me  well man thats thats up to your parents  can you talk to them theyll listen to you  well see okay  hey  let me see what youve got there  how the hell did this happen  well its my fault i let him into the rv  he said he wanted a walkie that you sent him for one  so on top of everything else he lied  whats he thinking  he wants to learn how to shoot he asked me to teach him  now its none of my business  but im happy to do it its your call  im not comfortable with it  oh dont make me out to be the unreasonable one here rick  i know i have my concerns too but  theres no but he was just shot  hes just back on his feet and he wants a gun  better than him being afraid of em  there are guns in camp for a reason  he should learn to handle them safely  i dont want my kid walking around with a gun  but how can you defend that  you cant let him go around without protection  hes as safe as hell ever be right here  look everything youre saying  makes perfect sense it feels wrong  i mean i didnt feel good  about him following you out into the woods  and i wish id said something i shouldve gone with my gut  hes growing up thank god  weve got to start treating him more like an adult  then he needs to act like one  hes not mature enough to handle a gun  im not gonna play with it mom  its not a toy  im sorry i disappointed you  but i want to look for sophia  and i want to defend our camp  i cant do that without a gun  shanes the best instructor i know  ive seen him teach kids younger than carl  you will take this seriously  and you will behave responsibly  and if i hear from anyone in this camp  that youre not living up to our expectations  he wont let you down  yeah  now if youre gonna do this you listen to shane   okay dad  all right you be careful   you coming  i gotta help dale  clean the spark plugs on the rv  he said hes gonna teach me mechanics  i should probably go look for him  you found me  hes a good learner  spark plugs huh  want to tell me whats going on  youre old  youre you know things  so  what if somebody told you something  that somebody else should know  glenn stop being dramatic spit it out  theres theres walkers in the barn  and loris pregnant  hey come on man dont give me that gangsta shit  good work  dont be discouraged  youll hit the target eventually  who says i didnt hit my target  try this one its heavy  you get better balance twice the rounds  id say shes got the hang of it  id say shes ready for the advanced class  it might be worth your while  after the rest of us head back to camp  sure why not   hows it feeling  i like the weight  so you decided not to leave us  something change your mind   got it  thats a great shot  nervous nelly  she find her way home  found her in her stall this morning  i love your fields  took a long walk this morning  i ended up by the barn  i heard the moans  thats unfortunate  im sure you have your reasons for keeping this a secret  i saw the broadcasts before they stopped  saw the irrational fear the atrocities  like the incident at my well  we put down a walker  you killed a person  well if you watched  the same broadcasts i did  you saw walkers attack  kill theyre dangerous  a paranoid schizophrenic is dangerous too  we dont shoot sick people  with all due respect  you are cut off from the outside world here  but ive seen people that i cared about  die and come back  and theyre not people  my wife and stepson  are in that barn  theyre people  im sorry  let me help  ill speak to rick hes a good man  we can make the barn more secure keep everybody safe  the barn is secure  keep this to yourself if you want to help  rick is a man of conscience  but are you so sure about everyone in your group  afternoon  i take it your boy did well  not bad actually  be grateful you dont have a daughter  if only things were as simple as wanting to shoot  carls getting that chance thanks to you  and im eternally grateful  for what you did and your hospitality  well earn our keep  i appreciate that but with carl getting better  i imagine youll be moving on soon  fort benning i hear   still a virgin  the targets too small  come on thats crap halfhour ago  i saw you nail a bullseye at 25  it wasnt moving  you think a walkers gonna hold still for you  focus and reload go again  uhoh did i piss you off  come on girl youve got walkers all around you  theyre the woods theyre in the rv  youre gonna need more than a damn screwdriver   stop badgering me  youre too damn emotional  you need to shut it down take all that guilt  take that fear that being pissed off take it out  right cause youre so calm  see that see i can be pissed off  i could be whistling dixie and ill always hit the target  but you god you shoot like a damn girl  you stand here and you point your weapon  point like you point your finger do not think about it  im talking about muscle memory girl  muscle memory  now go on shoot that son of a bitch  hes coming for you hes 10 away  hes 9 hes 5 away  right there thats the walker that got amy  now you shoot that son of a bitch shoot him  hershel expects us to leave  does anybody else know  not yet   were you gonna tell me  of course  when how long have you known  not long you dont need to worry about this  how can you expect me not to worry we have shelter here  and food and water and medical care  ive been talking with hershel its not carved in stone  he thinks it is  we have to fix this  people are settling in here theyll be devastated  i know im working on it  maybe i can talk to him too and plead our case  no things are uneasy the best thing right now  is to give hershel some space  dont look at me like that  like what  like youre scared like you dont trust me  i can take it from everyone else but not from you  i dont understand how you could keep  something like this from me  carls barely on his feet and sophias missing  and daryl and tdog are hurt how can we leave  its not what i want either but if we have to go  ill do whatever it takes to make sure  you and carl are okay  well get by we will  okay  come on let me give you a lift  my feet work just fine  look im just trying to get you rattled  give you an idea  what its like when the shit starts to fly  is that an apology  i crossed the line when i brought amy into it  yeah its an apology  youre a real dick sometimes  yeah i acknowledge that ill tell you what  ive got a lead on sophia im gonna go check it out  why dont you come with me be my backup  my wife was pregnant once  she miscarried  and we didnt try again after that  im so sorry  the thing that i remember most  is how nauseated she became  at the smell of cooking meat  and she was a meateating gal my wife  but with the pregnancy  that thanksgiving  the turkey  she couldnt be in the house  for two days until it was aired out  poor thing  glenn told you  what did you expect the boy has no guile  i havent told rick  i cant  because of shane  was it that obvious  no no i dont think anyone knew  i didnt not for sure  look i thought my husband was dead  and i felt like i died with him  and i  i wanted to feel something anything  and now i hate myself for it  and the baby  its ricks  none of the rest of it matters  then whats your concern  memories are what keep me going now  memories of what life used to be  and i  ive got a deep well to draw on  i still remember joy  but i think carls well is already running dry  and this baby  the baby wont have any good memories at all  only fear and pain  you cant think like that  we can still find joy  and we can still take strength from each other  do you really think this baby has a chance  that it could grow up and live a happy life  look me in the eye and tell me  that my baby will grow up to be your age  and die happy  tell me tell me you believe that  im sorry im it just came out and it was dale  its okay i never should have put you in that position  ive been thinking about what you said  about needing help  and youre right that i do  name it yeah  if youre still willing to make a run into town for me  im your man  thank you  its okay its not a big deal really  you didnt have to come  you could hate me from a distance  please say something   maggie i  i asked for your trust and you betrayed it  now my dads pissed at me  your turn  so your dad thinks theyre sick  you agree with that  even after what you saw at the well  im not sure what i saw at the well  yes you are  look if youd seen atlanta  you would not have a barn full of walkers  i wish youd stop calling them that  what do you call them  mom  shawn  mr and mrs fischer lacey duncan  what does she want now  i cant say  so when one of them asks you to keep your mouth shut  crawl out of my butt  and help me look please  youve got to be kidding me  no  no no  glenn   maggie  glenn help me  help glenn  get it off me help  did it get you did it bite you  glenn  were gonna have to go house to house  well start at the far end and well work our way back  if sophia got this far

  your soap opera digest  maggie  next time you want something get it your damn self   were not your errand boys  honey i  and heres your abortion pills   that was not cool  which part  the part where that bitch almost got us killed  i shouldve gone alone  if you want to blame anybody blame me  right take the blame  you know for a smart guy youre really stupid  okay im confused  because i think you just paid me a compliment but you made it s  ive already lost three of the people  that i care about most in this world   maggie  shut up  youre smart youre brave  youre a leader but you dont know it  and your friends dont want to know it  theyd rather have you fetching peaches  theres a dead guy in the well send glenn down  youre walker bait  i cant take you becoming one of them  sophia  anyone  sophia  they walled off the hallway  they tried to make a stand here  sophia  she was never here  was she  i dont know how to tell carol this was another dead end  come on lets move  cover that street ill clear the car  oh shit  focus now clear the jam focus   are you kidding me  come on i got your back go  andrea andrea lets go  come on  andrea come on  the blood on maggies shirt  she was attacked  are you guys all right how bad was it  it was pretty close  im so sorry  i should never have asked you to go  i offered  i thought the town was safe but if you hadnt come back  but we did i always do  the morningafter pills will they even work  i dont know  and i dont know if i want them to  then i got these too  just in case  prenatal vitamins  thats a hell of a choice  im glad its not mine  lori were friends arent we  with everything weve been through yeah  i cant tell you what to do  i could never tell you something like that  but your choice  maybe you shouldnt make it alone  come on then  get over here get over here  anything  not today  im so sorry  well cover more ground tomorrow  what happened out there  um i   the place was overrun  yeah  lets go get you cleaned up  shane shane  i was thinking  youve got that nice new ride of yours  plenty of fuel more than enough for you to get far from here  what you telling me to leave  i know youve been planning to  maybe now is a good time  is this about andrea  im looking out for the group  you think the group would be better off without me dale  why dont you tell that to rick or lori  their boy would be dead if i hadnt put my ass on the line  and otiss  youve been vague about that night about what happened  otis died a hero  so youve said  a little boy lived because of what went down that night  i think you ought to show some gratitude   i wasnt there  no man you werent  but i was the time that you raised your gun on rick   come on jesus  you had him in your sights  and you held him there  i know what kind of man you are  you think id shoot rick  that is my best friend  thats the man that i love  i love him like hes my a brother  you think thats the kind of man i am  thats right  well maybe we ought to just think that through  say im the kind of man  whod gun down his own best friend  what do you think id do to some guy that i dont even like  when he starts throwing accusations my way  what do you think  is there something you need to tell me  we cant leave im pregnant  are you  i threw them up  you can yell if you want  you can scream if you have to  but talk to me  how long have you known  does it matter  days weeks and you didnt tell me   im telling you now  no  i found these so glenn knows right  instead of going to me you sent him to get pills  i panicked you tell me we have no roof and no walls  do not put this on me  you tear into me for keeping secrets when youre holding onto this  you want me to bring a baby into this  to live a short cruel life  how can you think like that  we cant even protect the son we already have  so this is the solution  rick i threw them up  i screwed up  i dont know how we do this  we can make it work  how tell me how  well figure it out  shouldnt we try to figure it out  you threw up the pills  you want this baby i know you do  not like this  not giving birth in a ditch  not when its life will hang by a thread  from the second its born  not when every cry will put it  and carl and everyone we care about in danger  thats not right  rick not even giving it a chance isnt right either  maybe this is why i didnt want to tell you  i still i still dont understand why  you really think id make you have a baby you dont want  no so that if i went through with it  it would be on my conscience and not yours  maybe thats true  but i cant live like this anymore  lori  we cant live like this  is there anything else  i should know about  shane and i  i know of course i know  you thought i was dead  the world went to shit and you thought i was dead  right  yeah
