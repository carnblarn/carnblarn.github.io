thinking im dating  a 40yearold driving instructor whos not even cute  haley just got her learners permit  weve been taking turns driving with her  one of the really standard rules of the road  is we

youre freaking me out  this navigation systems all messed up  it thinks werin a park  oh my god it is a park  away from the kids  where do i go aim for the lake  the lake aim for the lake  makes you realize were all just hanging by a thread  the last thing manny needs on his first day of school  is you undermelting his confidence  undermining now ure doing it to me too  im sorry but theres only two places  anyone should wear a poncho   niagara falls and log rides  you think too much about these things  i wear all sort of daring outfits all the time  and people admire them because i wear them with the confidence  im sure its the confidence theyre admiring    i just  i just think its a little overthetop  you know what you need to loosen up and have fun  i am loose im fun  remember  breakfast for dinner last week  my idea  ever since we brought lily home youve been tense  all you do is put child locks on things read parenting books  would you please stop and   here  just hold

when your kids were small did you ever  i dont know uh smack their heads into a wall  usually we just gave timeouts  no no accidentally  um we  we just kind of bonked lilys head  and she  it really wasnt very hard  and shes not acting any differently  but i just worry  relax  it happens  luke used to bang his head all the time and hes fine  okay all right thank you  thanks that helps okay okay  we got to take her to the doctor  load up the car  jay gloria  im here  i uh just dropped manny off at school  and i realized  i just dropped manny off at school  oh boy  and i was hoping wed still have a few more good years  before the mind started to go  no what im saying  we have the day to ourselves for the first time in months  we should take advantage of it   go to the club  nice lunch  some massages  what about work  im the boss  since i married you people are surprised i come in at all    jays very spontaneous  hes always surprising me with little presents  fun getaways  i wasnt the greatest husband the first time around  but im trying to do better this time  and maybe by my third marriage ill have it down pat    yeah that ones gonna cost me  whatcha reading there a book  yeah ive been meaning to get to it for a while  oh its got a map at the beginning  i like it when books do that  uhhuh  do you have an open house this morning  i rescheduled  thought you might like some company  ahh  phil well the first day of school can be tough  for stayathome moms  now you have to understand  the kids are gone  the nest is empty they are rudderless  and a lot of guys wouldnt even notice  but im not a lot of guys  i listen with my mind and if you pay attention  women will tell you what they want  by telling you the opposite of what they want  like the other day claire was like  you have to move your car  theres no space in the garage for both of our cars  and what shes really saying is that you know  i should probably get a sports car  i was sort of looking forward to a quiet day  thought id just read maybego for a run later  thats it  great well run together  you dont have to do that  know  listening  the thing is i like to run alone  and i run kind of fast so  so  so im not sure  youre gonna be able to keep up with me    youre k youre kidding right no  you really think i cant keep up with you  im not sure you can keep up with this conversation  i think youre forgetting that i powerwalk every morning  and that i wear my special ses with the big soles  which were designed by a doctor  yes i know  but i run every day  you really think you can run as fast as me  no phil i think i can run much much faster  than you  boom  just like that the whole day changed  it was game on  she knew it i knew it we both knew it    i just want to read  i think ill order what i had the last time  what was that called  you just want me to say it because you want me to roll my rs  come on  reuben    jay what is this  oh looks like my old car cover  dont give me that this is mannys poncho  what is it doing here  maybe he decided to take it off on the way to school  what did you say to him nothing  i told some jokes  you said plenty with your jokes  jay he looks up to you  he respects your opinion  we dodged a bullet on this trust me  ive been down this road before  i remember one time mitchell decided to wear  a jaunty scarf to school  i kept my mouth shut  he got his jaunty butt kicked  my dad has this perception that i was very flamboyant as a kid  which is just  its nonsense  because i kept the whole gay thing very under wraps  you know i was just a guys guy  ii was basically a jock  you know  so we should crush mannys spirit  and destroy everything that makes him who he is  im just sing its no fun  to see your kid get picked on every day  getting tormented just because hes different  now im telling you it rips your heart out  well batman doesnt get picked on and he wears a cape  a poncho is just a cape that goes all the way around  batman doesnt get picked on because hes a muscular genius  manny cant make it to the top bunk  were taking this poncho to manny at school  its important that he knows that we support m  and then we go get those massages  that sounded good  i always take the stairs two at a time  i dont even think about it anymore  the regular way would seem weird  phil let it go im faster than you  if only there was some way we could settle this  once and for all but how  huh  you seriously want to race me  i ran a half marathon last year  wow im half scared  okay we do need to do this  ill go change  not now i got a conference call  but how about after that  great this afternoon  sweet  two at a time two at a time two at a   son of a gun got to fix that step  two at a time already at the top so  hi im dr miura  im on call today  looks like we have a little head bump  yeah it happened a couple hours ago on a doorjamb  oh ouch  we used to do this thing in school  where they would give you an egg  and you  you know you couldnt break it  and it was supposed to teach you how hard it was to be a parent  but  the real thing its  its  its so much harder  we did that in my school too  it didnt turn out so well  went through a dozen eggs  yeah well hes a nervous eater  no i broke a dozen eggs oh  im sorry i just assumed that   i know  i know what you assumed  there doesnt seem to be any mark  well her head was somewhat protected  protected  was she wearing a hat  yes yes it was like a hat  it was a wig  actually sort of a ghettofabulous afro thing  i thought it might be medically relevant  really  you thought ghettofabulous might be medically relevant  maybe i should just finish with the exam  yes thanks  youll be pleased to know  that mitchell and i intend on raising lily  with influences from her asian heritage  that is fantastic  have you noticed any vomiting since the head bump  uh no no no  weve hung some art in her room some asian art  and then when shes ready for solid food  there is a fantastic pho place  right around the corner from our house  am i pronouncing that right  is it pho   its a soup  i dont know  im from denver  we dont have a lot ofpho there  just to be sure  could you show me how hard lily got hit  and u use your head  oh yeah so i mean really it was  it was just sort of like um  could i see that again  um it was just  just a head bump you know  how are you feeling  uh fine  so is lily  babies are designed to survive new parents  so stop worrying you guys are doing great  thank you  denver  i dont see any ponchos  which means either the kids dont wear them  or the ones who do wear them disappear  were doing the right thing  i support manny no matter what  children need to know that you believe in them  its the most important thing  if you tell them they have wings  they will believe they can fly  oh really  i had a buddy went to woodstock  believed he could fly  didnt end great  its why hotel windows dont open anymore  is something wrong whos died  no one manny  why would you even think that  in colombia manny went to pablo escobar elementary school  if you were pulled out of class  it was definitely to identify a body  well we got your poncho here  i thought you said it made me look like  my neck was wearing a dress  that was a joke  oh good its still in the pocket  what do you got there buddy  my pan flute  im going to play some colombian folk music  for my new classmates  huh great  ive never been more proud of you  im sure your friends are gonna love it  break the flute what  the poncho by itself is fine  the poncho plus the flute plus the stupid dance   my son will die a virgin  thats right  hey sport can i take a look at that whistle  oh geez look at that  and now you stepped on it what  oh darn whwhats wrong with me  here let me get it  thank you  you know what actually maybe you should do this  why ii dont want to bump her head against the door  you know pinch her with the seat belt  mitchell how
