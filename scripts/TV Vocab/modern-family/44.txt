nota  shoot  thats weird my cello teachers cars in here  i wonder if shes not home  okay so go knock on the door alan einstein  dont leave and its albert  i know alans his dorky brother who played the

completely off the grid  did you see how cute gloria was with lily  oh pat is hilarious  i dont think shes paid taxes in 20 years  but very hospitable  always has a deer in the freezer  would you listen to me  i think that gloria and my dad could be lilys guardians  look you know i love jay and theyre still in the mix  but i just dont know about him raising a child  well cam he raised me  well now youve put me in an awkward position  oh look at that thats adorable  lets see if we can get you some snow pants  i just wish i felt better  i think im coming down with flulike symptoms  couple of hours before your camping trip huh  i want to go  its just if im sick i might get the chaperones sick  and without chaperones its anarchy   manny listen to me  the buddy system falls apart  the principle of last in first out is ignored   its butterflies  where  youre just nervous because theres gonna be a lot of physical activity  which is not exactly your strong suit  it is a little daunting out there  d dont use the word daunting in nature okay  you just need a little selfconfidence  look at this they got one of these rock walls here  why dont you hop up on that  why  why to prove that you can do it  if you can do that you can do anything  really can i fly can i speak chinese  no but you can sleep in the house tonight  ace want to wire my boy up here go ahead  im sorry i went behind your back  but you get so defensive whenever we talk about lukes issues  he doesnt have issues youre just a worrier  like when you thought he was never gonna talk  he was 2 and all he could do was bark   i understood him  phil  look he starts coming here  the other kids find out he becomes a target  like that limping gazelle at the watering hole  that the alligator knows to eat  theyre crocodiles not alligators  there are no alligators in africa  how about at the zoo bam who needs a shrink now   mr and mrs dunphy  yes  hi  luke im gonna talk to your mom and dad for a minute okay  okay shes like the best doctor ever  a couple of puzzles no shots  i didnt even have to take my pants off  found that one out a little late  ive been there buddy  mwah  well lukes a terrific kid  i have a few thoughts but honestly  i dont see anything thats cause for alarm  awesome thanks so much for your time  we we would love to hear your thoughts  well hes a bright and curious boy  but he gets distracted   mmhmm  mmhmm  i see it all the time with aboveaverage kids  mmhmm phil honey i want you to hear this  mmhmm  theyre a little overstimulated  because there are so many things theyre interested in  they never seem to focus  makes me crazy  too crazy  well they usually do outgrow it   what if they dont  he will  well theres theres medication  but why dont we cross that bridge if we come to it  is there any way to avoid that bridge altogether  you know maybe theres diet or  or focusing exercises or something  mrs dunphy what exactly are you worried about  get comfortable  im worried hes turning into you phil  i knew the minute i opened my mouth  that i was in the wrong  but honestly sometimes i wonder about him   hey mom check it out  what are you doing  if i move my head fast enough  it looks like the can is standing still  hes totally right  i just find it interesting that you blame jay  for everything from your night terrors  to your shy bladder  and now hes the perfect guardian for lily  no not perfect and and i never said anything about my shy bladder  o oh then why did i have to stand guard outside the bathroom  at peppers three faces of new years eve party  damn it manny move it go  its scary  youre 2 feet off the ground  ive seen vines climb walls faster than that  move your butt  oh well theres your esteembuilding parent right there  wait wait i think i hear future lily  sending us a message from her stripper pole  thanks gay dead dads this dance is for you  excuse me jay  im getting down  not till you touch the top what is it  well maybe if we didnt bully manny so much but rather showed him  he wouldnt be so afraid  excuse me sherpa can you assist me with the harness  oh no which one of these is my driving machine  phil i already apologized it just it came out wrong  funny i thought that was my problem  i came out wrong  hold on  oh good i can walk again  honey you know sometimes you can act a little bit  oh no where did everyone go  oh just a blink  phil when you are ready to talk to me like an adult  why dont you let me know  fine okay okay  the adults are the big ones right  hey how do you think that got up there  uhoh  now i know it seems daunting manny but its very simple  im securely hitched to a rope  which means im not going to fall  you know dad youre really making my life difficult right now  how  by barking at manny like a drill sergeant  when im trying to convince cam  that youd be a great guardian for lily   guardian  yeah   youre kidding  aah  jay  yeah never mind  that really hurt  this is a mistake  why does she keep saying that  because theyre the first words she ever heard  here you go first  this will teach that skank a lesson  shaving cream in her locker  just stand over there and yell if someones coming  she might have homework assignments in there  she hasnt handed in yet  haley   someones coming  run   this way this way  okay okay okay   where are we  boys locker room  it smells like feet   thats not feet  okay  im so scared  just go to your happy place  we just broke into my happy place  whos there  shh shh shh shh  go go run run  not so loud run run  so how you doing  oh not good im just glad my clown training prepared me to take a fall like that  yeah and in terms of talking about it  are we looking at weeks months  do not minimize it you who i had to rush to the emergency room  that time you fell out of your clogs  theres your bubbly water with lemon  thank you jay  how you doin  oh its hard to tell  you know anytime you have  a catastrophic injury to your lumbar area  i could use a little piece of lumbar myself right now  well i hope youre comfortable now  making my family lilys guardians  hola hola  youre forgetting about gloria  even you have to admit how amazing she is with lily  mm look whos so pretty  oh my god  gloria what did you do  what i told you  you pierced her ears  what i said  i was going to make her pretty with earrings  i thought you said hair rings  what are hair rings  yes mitchell what are hair rings  something that you would tie your hair back  she said it  i didnt say hair rings i said earrings  you dont like  of

god i cant believe we just did that  can you believe we just did that  yeah we had a lot of fun lets not geek it up  wait what if i have a taste for it now  am i gonna start doing stuff like that all the time  calm down you just did one bad thing  two  i skipped my cello lesson today  that wasnt even where my teacher lives  you ditched a class  well i i didnt have time to practice  because of lacrosse and debate team and  do you even like playing the cello  yeah  alex  i hate it  so quit  ive never quit anything  youve never broke into a school before  just did that  no offense but the familys hopes and dreams  are kind of pinned on me  im just saying that no one would blame you  if you stopped being so perfect  it actually would take a lot of pressure off of me  i did something bad too  something that nobody knows   what  come here  i cant say it too loud okay  what did you do  phil im just not sure you understand  why i said what i said  there are qualities about me you wish you could change  but you cant cause im all grown up  but its not too late for luke  okay  honey there are a hundred things about luke  that he gets from you that i absolutely love  its just this this one tiny part  that im sure if i could just get in there and just ee  claire hes a great kid  hes gonna be fine  i know  i think i know  i feel terrible that we fought in front of him  did he say anything about that on the drive here  how would i know he rode with you  he didnt drive with me he drove with you  just admit it you want lily raised by anyone but my family  its just so far away from everything she knows  and then theres the crazy aunts and the frozen cows  oh please in the last hour  your father publicly shamed manny dropped me from the sky  while his wife drilled holes in our babys head  oh  which is why i think we should revisit claire and phil  where are my keys  we left luke alone in a parking garage  we dont know the whole story  dont we   whose car are we taking  mine  then im driving  hey mom   buddy  luke   buddy  lukey   thank you so much  honey get out of there  thank you  im so sorry we are so sorry  oh buddy you mustve been so scared   no  oh god  well

 hey hey  you know why else hes gonna be okay  no  because somewhere out there is a worried little girl  whos making lists and labeling bins  and hes gonna find her  mm  oh  cam  i know youre kind of down on jay being lilys guardian  now thats not anything you need to worry about manny  i just think youre being too hard on him  we had a little chat in the car  im sorry i let you down jay  im
