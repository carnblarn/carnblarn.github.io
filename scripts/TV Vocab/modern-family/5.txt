street smart  yeah and then theres luke  oh hes just hes just curious thats all  hes got this almost scientific mind  with a thirst for knowledge  hes like this little einstein  some people ask why   luke asks why not    i ask why a lot  were at the 10 were at the five  were at the one daddy were scoring a touchdown  no please please dont spike our baby  why is she dressed like the hamburglar  shes a referee oh do do we even have to go to my dads tonight  are you kidding me were playing ohio state  i collect antique fountain pens  im quite adept at japanese flower arrangement ikebana  and i was a starting offensive lineman at the university of illinois  surprise  i dont like football you know what  i thought part of being in a relationship  was pretending to enjoy your partners interests  do you think i really loved home picklemaking  yeah cause you did  for a week until we became the weird guys who gave everybody pickles  oh thank you marvin for inviting us into your lovely home  here would you care for a sack of pickles   it was charming  we were picklers mitchell  okay you know what fine stay home with your little jagged scissors   maybe catch up on your scrapbooking  come

hey hey hey   no problem well be right down thanks        hey honey whats up  the school just called luke got in a fight  oh geez is he okay  yeah hes fine but they want us to come down there  where are you im showing a house  what house  im golfing     i bet it was that durkas kid i hate that kid  he probably jumped on luke and luke just fought back  kids a menace he made fun of my hair once  shh the parents are probably in there  i slept on it funny like that never happened to him come on   what are you doing here  these two knuckleheads were fighting each other   what   couldve been worse  i was not ready to face durkas today  so what happened  well apparently there was some namecalling and shoving on the playground  by the time a teacher separated them  luke was sitting on mannys chest   luke thats not like you  wait a minute   youre lukes father  grandfather   so mannys father is  javier  crazy guy thats where he gets his fire   okay youre  hes our son   and my grandson  im his daughter   so youre  his uncle  stop saying that or ill sit on your chest again  ho wait a second is that what this was all about  he keeps calling me his nephew you are my nephew  shut up  okay okay  im getting the sense that youre all related uh somehow  so its probably best if you work this out at home  so the boys can go back to class okay  but were not happy about this boys  this is not how mature young men behave  heres your note for miss passwater      look i wouldnt worry theyre good kids  its just tough when one kids a little different  yes yes  you heard how she said that right   yes   she thought luke was the weird one luke  her kid gets his head stuck in the furniture  and manny is the different one  i will tell you whats weird our son is not weird  whats weird is that her kid wears aftershave and dresses like a count  i think we should cancel with them for the barbecue  if we cancel itll just make this a bigger deal than it is  itll be good for luke and manny to spend some time  might be good for you and gloria too why  shes always had a problem with me  i think im gonna find out what it is  thats the worst thing you could do just sweep it under the rug  im not a sweeper trust me on this  i think you two need to talk it out  i dont have anything to say to her  shes the one with the problem not me  whose side are you on shes my daughter youre my wife  lets remember whats important here  theres a football game on  i just hate it when my two girls arent getting along  how exactly is she your girl   i got a few things for the party  is lily

listen i heard what you said and i thought yes  i should try to learn more about football  that is very mature of you  i figure if football fans can learn it how hard can it be  thats very elitist of you  im taking baby steps here all right  im actually im really looking forward to it  cause its not just the game  itsits the bands and the drama the pageantry  dont forget about the team mascots they wear ascots  no mascots with an m  that could have been very embarrassing  okay  am i straight  im not sure what you are right now hmm  hi hi hi hi how ya doin  hey gramps hi beautiful  hi phil

at school today  do you have any feelings youd like to express  i think this is the proper forum  for gods sakes all right both of you  now in this family do we kick and punch each other  or do we love each other   love each other thats right  iii be in the den  so i brought dessert  okay thank you  i make pie too  you can never have too many pies right  okay whoa whoa  everybody take a deep breath lets think about getting real   phil no  why phil no  what is phil doing  im just gonna say it  theres tension between you two  bam its out there im gonna kill you  i think hes right and i think we should talk about it  thats what im talkin bout  you two talking  bout it   first and goal to go for the illini  i like football  haley hates it which is weird because its all boys  and theres no reading required  do you know that she spends at least 45 minutes every morning doing her hair  and then sometimes  lets go illini   lets go right now   looks like i gotta watch the game with dick butkus  dad dad come on thats offensive  mitchell hes one of the greatest linebackers to ever play at illinois  and one of my personal heroes  and his name is buttkiss  were just choosing to okay all right  dad i thought you were being homophobic im sorry  we got all night yes we do   are you joining us here  yeah jay you know what hes been studying up  i gotta tell ya im a little worried about cj hightower  right with the bad ankle im wondering how hes gonna run his corner routes   hightowers out  what  oh then who is gonna run the corner routes  ill tell you who it wont be billings   thats low hes in jail  oh wow yeah then no  double tight end its gonna be a quarterback rollout to the left   theyre gonna run it trust me hes got the slot in the end zone touchdown  lucky call maybe they uh shouldve considered blitzing  blitzing wouldnt have helped them get outta here  oh gosh blitzing   so my interest in football ended as suddenly and dramatically  as the climax of west side story  im a musical theater fan  surprise  okay the truth i sometimes feel like you dont like me  wow  powerful powerful stuff  claire tell us how that makes you feel  right now im feeling a lot of anger no dont tell me tell her  gloria right now im really angry at phil   lets respect the process    gloria i dont know why you think i dont like you  sometimes when you see me you make that face what face   like this  i do not make a face like that  oh my god that is so claire mitchell  see she does that with everyone its just her face  no its not just the face  from the beginning i feel like manny and i are not welcome in this family  that is so crazy no its not so crazy its how i feel     i am sorry if you feel that way  i really am because from the moment i met you  i have tried to make you feel comfortable with us  you think its all in my head  no kind i dont know  i mean we really love having you and manny in our family  really really  so you dont have to be so defensive  i do that dont i   well a bit  im feeling a hug   i was thinking group hug but this is nice  id be there if i could oh my god theres hugging  haley get off the phone already   where did you go you heard him he said get outta here  oh my god youre such a girl  dad i was coming to get a beer anyways  nice apology nice beer     hey there are the little roustabouts  you look like you patched things up pretty good huh  yeah  oh we can learn so much from the children  bet it seems kind of silly now what you were even fighting about huh   i made fun of his accent  what accent  i made fun of him for having the same thing for lunch every day    eegh  i made fun of him because his mom used to dig coal  what  he said you were a coal digger  okay i think we can move on   who said i was a coal digger  thats what my mom told me whats a coal digger  sweetheart he heard it wrong its gold digger  im gonna have to call you back  i really do not think that i remember ever saying that  well you said in the car  you said it at christmas you said it in the mexican restaurant  okay mr leaves his sweatshirts at school every day  suddenly remembers everything thank you  and it was all in my head huh  oh listen gloria it was like a year ago before i knew you  nice going now my mom and my sister are fighting  if i say something that everybody else is thinking  does that make me a mean person  or does it make me a brave person  one who is courageous enough to stand up andand say something  behind someones back to a 10yearold   well shes pissed  yeah she wouldnt even come out of her room oh  did you really have to call her that a gold digger  well you know what dad it was a year ago  and it was a natural question to ask  shes a beautiful hot woman  and youre not exactly you know  not exactly what  um mitchell little help  no you are doing great  see this is exactly why we sweep things under the rug  so people dont get hurt  yeah until you sweep too much under the rug then you got a lumpy rug  creates a tripping hazard you open yourself up to lawsuits  boy you can go a really long time without blinking  gloria its phil  hi can i talk to you for a second  claire likes to say you can be part of the problem  or part of the solution  but i happen to believe that you can be both  listen claire feels terrible  why dont you talk to her  why i know what she thinks a coal digger   you know shes saying gold digger  yes phil  well ii know she said that  but that was a long time ago before she knew you  does jay buy me nice things  yes of course all beautiful things  look at this yellow red blue  all the colors  do you think i cant live without this take them away phil  gloria we all know youd be fine without underwear  i mean we know its not about that  no its about me not being accepted by my new family  that is not true gloria look youre a beautiful woman  in fact youre probably one of those beautiful women who doesnt even know it  no i know it  so its natural for claire to wonder about you and her dad  this familys very protective of each other  i remember the first time claire brought me home  do you think jay thought i was good enough for his little girl  no way but over time  he realized that i loved claire as much as he did  and by then mitch had brought cam home so i was golden  claire just needs a little time  and then trust me shell be the most loyal friend youve ever had  youre not leaving are you  you know theres kind of a lot of drama  so were torn let me ask you something  your sister said that gloria would never go for anybody who looked like me  now you guys basically are like women  you know you look at guys  so what do you think  youre seriously asking us if youre attractive  well i know im no erik estrada or anything  im just curious is all dad  so if i was in one of your bars and   righteous brothers were on you know  would you uh  i dont know check me out  dad youre really close to ruining gay for me  all right fine whatever jay jay now listen  i think its i just think its a little weird for a son to say this to his father  but for the record i think youre smokin hot really  yeah 100 youre totally my type  youre dangerous youre getable  you have a little cashola in your pocket   face body the whole the whole kit and caboodle i think really  what about a seven nine for sure nine  but you knew that i might have lowballed a little bit  okay isnt there a game on  touchy i know  gloria come on lets lets talk about this  ive seen her kick in a door before  i dont know what my husband is saying to you or  why hes covered in your underwear  obviously im trying to seduce him for his money   thats cause thats what i do right  what do i have to give back  so that everyone trusts me huh  these earrings  no  what this bracelet  no  my new dress no  i didnt respond because  this shouldnt be about me  it should be about you  talking to you about it  phil honey  no no no no  youre welcome    i dont know what to say except for that i am really really sorry  just tell me one thing how do you really feel that im with your father  uh well  honestly at first it was hard  i mean you dont expect to wake up one morning  with a new mom who looks like she fell off a mud flap  but im getting used to it  and the important thing is you make him happy  which you do in in so many ways  so many colors  are we okay   no  no  you embarrassed me in front of everyone downstairs  what im supposed just to forget about it  what do you want me to do just embarrass myself so were even  go jump in the pool oh you mean go jump in a lake right  go jump in the pool with your clothes on then i know youre sorry  im not gonna do that gloria  okay then i wont forgive you   now a field goal beats us  hey you guys work that out  almost gloria just wants me to jump in the pool  okay then what  if they could get a pass rush on em something a break  this is so awesome  i know mom does not look good wet  gloria is this really necessary  dad its fine its fine if i need to jump in this water  to prove to gloria how sorry i am i will do it  im fine   youre serious youre not gonna stop me  why would i do that  because i am standing here i am showing you my willingness to  no      are you happy  yes i forgive you   then give me your hand  oh thats the oldest trick in the book  shes gonna pull you in there  no   and thats my job      this is funny but this is also a teaching moment  yeah think about no     whoa    cannonball   the snap fumble how could he fumble that  center blew the snap i hate that  i played center and i always got blamed for a quarterbacks clumsy hands  well i was a quarterback and it was probably your fault  its impossible to fumble the ball  when the quarterback has the proper hand placement  its weird to think of a woman being sexually attracted to dad  no you wanna hear weird cam said hed pick up dad at a gay bar  ooh how did that come up mmm im really trying to block it out  as far as im concerned mom and dad had sex two times   agreed  okay get your hands up there like youre lifting me off the ground  be one with me jay there you go  do you wanna get something to eat i am never eating again  just snap the damn thing   perfect that one kinda hurt
