sorry to be snippy  its just im a little upset with cam  i needed his help this morning and he let me down  that doesnt sound like him you asked him to do something and he didnt do it  but he never asked i mean all he said was  lilys bag needs to be packed and the newspaper needs to be canceled  that sounds to me like he was asking for help  sounds to me like you expected him to read your mind   what am i a psychic  no its not about reading minds  its about knowing what your partner needs  heres an idea just say help me  you dont even have to say me just help  then hell know exactly what you want you wont have to get all mad  im not mad its just  you wanna believe youre on the same wavelength as someone and then its just  its a little disheartening when you find out youre not  thats all
