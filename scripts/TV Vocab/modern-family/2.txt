made a mistake  yeah a big mistake youre making me look really bad here  i told mom you were ready for this   its just a scratch dad  thats not the point luke what  i scratched it on my way into the driveway im sorry  so its not stolen  no why  thats good  cause there are bad people out there who would steal a bike  those are thieves  you sit there and think about the scratch part thats not good either   i gotta fix that step  so dont scratch anything while im gone unless it itches thats different  the good news is luke has his bike  more good news  i taught some random kid a valuable lesson by stealing his bike  best news claire knows nothing  so i figure ill just dump the new bike where i stole the first bike  that way random kid gets his back  and this new bike doesnt raise a lot of embarrassing questions  like why i had it or who boosted who through a bedroom window  so everybodys happy   uhoh  ah son of a you gave me the wrong screwdriver  maybe youre just using it wrong  my
