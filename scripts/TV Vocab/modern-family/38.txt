resignation  what you have with cam is very special   and i would never forgive myself if i came between you   treasure each other sincerely  broderick   oh  cam  what are we doing here  i dont know  maybe if some assistants crush is so important to us  it means we should appreciate each other a little bit more  well  i cant think of a better time to start come here  and the great thing about that text is we dont have to know which one of us he wanted  i know  what are you doing  valentines day isnt over y  juliana  sweetie  lets not push it  you almost got arrested tonight  thats how its gonna be   youre just giving upon  i am not giving up on us  i am giving up on clive and juliana  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  i know a couple people who could possibly save this night  maybe youve heard of them  two american kids  doing the best that they can   phil and claire dunphy  i am not going back to that hotel tonight  and im pretty sure youre not allowed to  dont need to  phil and
