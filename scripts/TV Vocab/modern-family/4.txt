go to a vortex meditation site  and work with a shaman to finally understand  how to live my spirituality  yikes  and ive learned that the only way  i can move to the next level of my awakening  is if we all can somehow get past  the incident  oh no  the incident  oh boy  i would like to congratulate jay and the lovely gloria  im very happy for them  i wanted a big beautiful wedding with jay  because my exhusband and i got married  in a tiny little office of a judge in colombia  well my mother wanted to go to the wedding  to show everyone how okay she was with all of it  so i convinced dad and gloria to invite her  who warned you that that was the worst idea ever  anyone  anyone  oh   of course ive  ive moved on    i was supposed to come with a date  but he just hurt his back  which is very ironic because hes young and  and healthy  my mom started drinking these cocktails  called horny colombians  with some of glorias uncles  whom apparently the drink was named after  phil oh come

everyone  if its okay foyou to join us  oh  i knew i could count on you  oh my beautiful boy  i love you so much  theres a fish in nature that swims around  with its babies in its mouth  that fish would look at mitchells relationship  with his mother and say thats messed up  hey  hey  boy   things with your mom got pretty intense down there huh  all like east coastwest coast  you feelin me  act like a parent talk like a peer  i call it peerenting  i learned it from my own dad who used to walk into my room  and say whats up sweathog    honey  i would love to let you go to the concert  are you

chas yeah  hes a logger  like a  like a lumberjack  no he logs blood samples into a cholesterol study  anyway until im past this whole wedding debacle  i cant be intimate with him  oh  we do things to each other  we use our hands  mm oh my lord  haley hey nana  oh my little comet hey  oh look at you youre all grown up  hmm tell mom that  she wont even let me go to a concert  overnight with her boyfriend    what are you laughing at  oh karmas a funny thing thats all  remember ricky  oh god  oh whos ricky  no one  ricky was your mothers boyfriend  and he looked like charles manson  and one night she didnt come home until 400 in the morning   wow mom what were you and ricky doing  nothing  we were doing nothing and he was a very sweet boy  which you might have known if you bothered to get to know him  dylans a sweet boy   dylan  dylan is no ricky ricky  ricky was a poet  dylan writes songs  awesome songs  and maybe you would know that  if you bothered to get to know him  ha    okay you know first of all i am not my mother  i dont judge people before i get a chance to know them  so you invite dylan over to dinner tonight  and if hes as sweet and as kind as you say he is  then i have no problem  considering letting you go to the concert  after i do a background check on uncle tobey  thank you thank you thank you mom  okay im gonna go call him  okay  thats very revealing  thats my parenting style  no i meant your blouse  mom  claire wait come    not making this easy  claire come on stop stop stop  just let her come to dinner  apologize to dad and gloria  and she and chas can live happily ever after  in canada in canada    wait why dont you make her fix this  instead of you doing it as usual  whoa whats that supposed to mean  oh you know mom makes a mess  and theres mitchell to clean it up  okay that is so not true  if  if anything youre the one  with the screwedup relationship with mommy   with  with  with mom wow mommy  no i didnt say it  damn it  ooh

gloria for a second  oh shes out dealing with a manny situation  he set a kids bike on fire  why  oh i might have told him to get even with some kids  and he went all rambo with it  not my best parenting moment   not your worst  whats up  uh well you know moms in town  your mom  no no your mom shes back from the grave  yes yes my mom  my mom would be less scary  listen shes a wreck about what happened at the wedding  and she wants to come to dinner tonight  to apologize to everyone  still her little errand boy i see  no why does everybody keep say no  i  im just trying to piece this family back together  so youll talk to gloria about mom coming to dinner  oh gloria would never go for that in a million years  shes still furious with your mother  which is why im not talking to you  what did i do  this conversation never took place  well thats not very nice i drove all the way here  no you didnt you were never here  in fact you never even called  i would have called but i thought it would be better  to talk about th what  whats happening here  listen  i would love to get this thing behind us  but gloria would never forgive me  if i pulled a fast one on her  thats why youre going to pull a fast one on her  and im not going to like it one bit  okay thats just great  no thats great so its all up to me  i cant hear you because youre back home  and im taking a nap
