                whats my favorite way to relax  throw on my wireless headphones and disappear into the nature channel    the young flatback turtle searches for food  on the ocean floor  this flatback however  the fascinating thing about nature  is how in the blink of an eye  it can go from a scene of total tranquil beauty  to raw primal violence  can you seriously not hear me with those things on  its noisecanceling technology give it a spin its got   sweetie focus now  mom why are you freaking out on everyone  because you are acting very irresponsibly all of you  listen honey luke has a giant

passes through the nerdy way it  oh you know i think its sweet  every couple years mitchell and his father go out and enjoy one of these showers together  oh i i wouldnt necessarily put it that way  i mean yes me and my father enjoy it because we dont share a lot of the same interests  like um ii never went to sports games with him  probably because you call em sports games  just lose the sports just just games  oh here comes your shower partner stop it  im kidding have fun with your dad okay all right see you later  dont worry about me im not  im just saying if you were   shotgun sucka

nervous  uh nervous no im not nervous  i was nervous  i mean when mitchell made plans with his father  i figured why not spend the evening with gloria  ive always wanted to be good friends with her  on paper we should be good friends  look at us one spicy curvy diva  and gloria  the problem is i had a little minor setback that we had to overcome  from a couple weeks ago   i cannot stand hanging out with his lvy league friends  oh theyre the worst theyre not that bad  they are the worst are you kidding me  debbie cant go two minutes without talking about columbia university  and the little guy with the lazy eye from harvard brown  whatever honestly i wish that tart would go back to columbia  and take her weird little brown friend with her       cam you need to relax you explained  not very well  you know how awkward i get when things get awkward  so when i said brown people i wasnt talking about your uh brown people  i was talking about people who go to a university  um not your people  nnot that your people couldnt go to college  okay now im hearing myself say your people a lot so    um just very excited because this is um  you know this is our first night out together so its our little date  where are we going  make sure your seat belt is securely fastened  and your tray tables are in the upright position  because i got us into palaiseau  ah fancy i know  its normally a fourweek wait  but the matre d is an old pilates brother of mine so just one phone call  okay  palaiseau   ay cameron you know what i dont know if im in the mood for something so fancy  can we just go somewhere like more simple  oh uh yes yes of course  we can what were what did you have in mind  i dont know  how bout a little latin place that i always used to go  that sounds fantastic okay  i

moms not dumb you cant just ask her to do something for you  you have to very carefully put the cheese in the trap  oh oops i got a little shell in the bowl   when that happens i find that i like to not do that  i got it its okay  oh thats thats really gross okay im gonna ill do this  you just mop up  and snap  is it bad that i feel sorry for her  so how do i start what do you think  i dont know mom usually tells me what to do  join the club im kidding i love your mom  we are going to try a new approach this time  now your goal is to create a display about the life and art of van gogh right  yeah okay you got your poster board right here  so pretend youre telling the story of his life  to someone who has never heard of him  what do you put on that board  i see the wheels spinning a spark of crea  how do they get the lead in pencils lets try to stay on topic  hey jay look who thinks mercury is the densest planet in the solar system  i take it from your mocking tone that i am incorrect  densest planet is earth  which makes you the densest guy on the densest planet  zing fine  you sure mitchell wont mind me tagging along  are you kidding he loves ya what are you worried about  ive never had a brother before we never really hung out that much  kiddo you are overthinking this  i just dont wanna say the wrong thing  you cant thats the beauty of having a brother  me and my brother were zinging each other all the time  you know like whats going on fat boy nothing much jackass  you know things of that nature  its its how brothers express love  hmm   shotgun sucka    yeah thats good  im gonna see the sights  not if they see you first  kind of missed with that one kid  all right  this is all you need to know right here  apparently the pencils in two pieces and they glue em together on the lead  what if we put all the stuff about his life on this side  and all the stuff about his paintings on this side  luke buddy thats fantastic  and the best part is you came up with that by yourself    all it took was a little bit of focus and uh  this thing is really loose im gonna go grab a screwdriver  but you run with this on your mark get set van gogh   hey dad  he kind of looks like uncle mitchell if uncle mitchell were insane        i got sprayed by a skunk  oh  oh you stink  and not just at astronomy blammo   what is happening   qu pas  i love this place  i was a little bit worried because its not exactly  i love this place   i was nervous  i mean there was a lot of different food on the menu  and on the floor and on the wall  uh are we are we sure were not
