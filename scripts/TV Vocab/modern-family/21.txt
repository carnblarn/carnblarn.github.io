i just heard about a good one but im supposed to be in school  well youre supposed to floss too but you got away with that one  come on lets go   one of the greatest days of my life  was when my old man sprung me from school and took me to the track  i wanted to do the same type of thing for manny  plus i figured when gloria heard about it maybe it pays off in the bedroom  i wonder if thats why my old man did it  oh crap   your motherinlaw just had to have the dog  turns out shes allergic  and the pet store didnt have a grace period or a return policy or anything  i got him from the pound  was there a twister in kansas cause theres a house in my driveway  welcome home mr dunphy uh always a pleasure mr dunphy  indeed it is mr dunphy place it there   oh i shall i shall  i miss this get in here   my dad is awesome  hes awesome hes always up hes always happy  i mean he and i are best buds were like two peas in a pod  or siamese twins or a snake with two heads  theyve actually been all those things for halloween yeah  oy this must be scout huh  i should warn you he sheds i made the mistake of letting him sleep with me on the road  now my sheets look like two bigfoots did it pardon the language   hows mom speaking of big feet eh  shes on a cruise with her girlfriends  some of which are not totally unattractive  oh that reminds me she sent some gifts for the kids  um i will be right back   you three get better acquainted  will do  bye will do  i cannot believe you got a dog without consulting me  this was a major family decision  it was wrong yeah  and im sorry mmm  but we have talked about getting a dog for years  and youre the only one who wasnt into it  because i knew that i would be the one taking care of it  thats not true uh  no we will all help mmhmm  this is a great chance to teach the kids responsibility  that is exactly what you said about lukes paper route   hey hey   hey hey hey hey   hey hey hey   hello   is anyone in there      reds a good color on you       its just a movie   oh hes so cute  look at his little face i always wanted a dog thanks grandpa  okay but remember having a dog is a major responsibility  everyone in the family has to pitch in   can do mrs d  not you dylan  oh phew cause i got a lot on my plate right now   hey look whos here uncle cam  hey we heard about the new addition and we had to come right over  cameron so good to see you again now that is a shirt  oh well thank you frank i get em online ill send you a link  oh well at home i smoke sausages ill send you a link   classic  and this must be lily oh yes  aww she just couldnt wait to meet the new doggy  i think shes good right here let me get in there and get some of that doggyness  oh there it is haley  there it is i gotta go  whats wrong that was brian he just quit the band  what why hes moving to portland his parents got back together  oh that sucks i know   now were gonna have to cancel the gig tomorrow  maybe you can find another drummer  no i think its too late for that now  i play drums  huh well i mean i havent played in a while  since lilys come along but if youre in a jam i can jam  well i totally would but im not sure we like the same sorts of music you know  what because im gay im just gonna want to play show tunes  no because youre old  wow that hurt more dylan  give him a chance its better than canceling  youre right i dont want to lose the deposit on that fog machine  okay lets do it  i used to be a music teacher but i gave that up as soon as lily came along  yes well we just felt that it was really important  that one of us stayed home to raise her so  yeah and thats not a judgment on other peoples choices  its just that we happen to be a very traditional family mmhmm  yes thats what the disabled lesbian shaman who blessed lilys room said too  how you doin buddy   all right relax      oh geez  i am telling you phil the man was crying  that is impossible my dad is the happiest guy on earth  it probably just sounded like he was crying  have you heard the noise he makes when he gets out of a chair  no i know what i heard i think this has something to do with your mom  what yeah he came here alone think about it  shes on a cruise yeah and they never take separate vacations so  no no if something was wrong my dad would tell me about it  no phil he wouldnt because you guys never actually talk about anything  we talk all the time he crank calls me at work like three times a week  crank calls dont count counts for fun  no honestly i think that you should find out whats going on with your dad  its going to be nothing my dad isnt like your dad  theres nothing deep and dark inside  his hard candy shell is just hiding more candy     i think he wants to go out good boy  smart dog i hate to break it to you but i think all dogs can do that  im gonna play outside     ow  uh what happened   okay  should i just play a little something  yeah but you know if it doesnt work out dont feel bad  well hopefully this is this is like riding a bicycle  and itll all come back to me   thats the loud one  so here we go  hmm  oh silly me  i had the sticks in the wrong hands  wow  dude you should label those sticks        is that the alarm has our perimeter been breached  its not the alarm the doorbell wont stop ringing  maybe a demon is ringing it not a demon  ay who keeps ringing the doorbell  were pretty sure its a demon oh yeah    there  if it were a demon it would keep on ringing  not if hes already inside im getting a weapon  what were you thinking  who takes a little boy to a horror movie thats loco jay  this is no big deal you want scary  when i was his age i lived through the cuban missile crisis  i slept with a butter knife under my pillow  in case i had to fight some soviet colonel  why would they send a soviet colonel to get a little boy  because i could identify every commie plane  what are we talking about  look all im saying being scared is part of growing up  manny
