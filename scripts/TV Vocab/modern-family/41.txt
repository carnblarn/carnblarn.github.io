went to a funeral last saturday and it got me thinking  about where gloria and i were gonna end up after we die  yeah its been a fun week  i dont like loose ends  so i made a few calls  i found these people selling a couple of primo plots  in the best cemetery in town  not that im gonna go there anytime soon  dont be so sure  with all the bacon that he eats  well got to give my cholesterol pills  something to do  mm i dont care how much they promote it  kale is a garnish  its not ready to anchor a meal  look at this  oh my god lilys little hat  that we bought her at the airport in vietnam  remember how cute she looked in that  remember how i used to wear it  and walk around and act like i had a giant head   mmhmm that was good acting  oh  so what are you doing  im putting together a little scrapbook  of how lily became ours  you know her adoption certificate  some pictures of her from her village  all out in the open so she has nothing to be ashamed of  you leaving that on all day  you know and im also gonna write a little storybook  you know something i can read her at bedtime  its called two monkeys and a panda  shes the panda because shes asian   and were monkeys because  i can draw monkeys  okay well i think this is a great project  and i believe you are gonna finish it   oh my god  what  lilys adoption certificate   her name is lily tucker pritchett  right  not tuckerpritchett like its supposed to be  first name lily middle name tucker  last name pritchett  well that cant be right  this is a legal document  she only has your last name  m mmy name is just a middle name  stay calm dont get upset  nobody knows anyones middle name   quick whats my middle name  scott  of course you know mine were a couple  okay look tthis is obviously a mistake  but youre the one who filled out this paperwork  you dont make mistakes like this  you correct mistakes like this  you did this on purpose  what  so your name could have top billing  okay no i am not gonna sit here and listen  to you accuse me of something so horrible  it makes so much sense now  why you wanted to fill out all these legal forms  okay well im a lawyer  i fill out all the legal forms  ever since you signed up for a 12year gym membership  the more you spend the more you save  all the women at work were too busy to use this certificate  so i called the spa  and asked them to extend the expiration date  but they said no  really  heres something they didnt count on  you mess with phil dunphy the claws come out  you have very nice hands  soft like ladys  thank you kim i appreciate that  my wife never seems to notice  this is it tada  what is tada  im just saying this is it tada  tada is when you do a flip  or where the magician cuts the pretty lady in half  not when you show someone  where you want to shove their dead body  im not gonna argue the proper use of tada  this is it  seriously in the file cabinet  its called a crypt  and how are you not getting how great this is  were four down from bugsy siegel  no im not going into any wall  im going in the ground  sorry not me  theres enough to not like about death  without adding dirt and worms  the whole thing gives me the willies  you die you go to the ground  is natural you go back to the earth  here youre just a mushy bag of bones  rotting away for all eternity  sorry for your loss  can we get the hell out of here  what am i supposed to tell the guy  tell them we dont want our bodies  inside these drawers where god cannot find us  these are not like our drawers at home  people can find things in these  im thinking of getting bangs  ooh you totally should  you would be so cute with bangs  you have the face for it i dont  oh theres my better half  kim would you mind  thank you  hey honey where are you  oh im on my way to downey  oh uh did you know  karen and richard carpenter grew up in downey  what random and nothelpful fact phil  im sorry im im having kind of a rough day  yeah im kind of having a rough day myself  look phil i need you to take care of dinner for me  whats wrong  oh alex ripped haleys favorite sweater  and now im driving around from store to store  trying to find the exact same one before haley finds out  dont do that just explain to her what happened  mnhmnh haleys not gonna understand   sure she will  no phil you dont understand  im trying to avoid this turning into a whole big thing  then just get her something close  shell never know the difference  phil could you just take care of dinner sweetie  thats all im asking thats it  im just saying theres a simpler way to do this  there is no simpler way just make dinner  thank you  hello  what  mr pritchett  were the rutledges  the ones selling the spots  hi hi  oh my gosh look honey  i hadnt heard martin is in  well look at that  im sorry is that a friend of yours weve made a point  to get to know everyone in the neighborhood  we think it makes it less awkward you know later  oh im sorry this is my wife gloria  oh  im ed and this is my bunk  and this is my loving wife  and devoted mother of three winnie  shell be here  i dont know what our lineup is yet  but at home i sleep on the right side  so probably there  we dont mean to be rude  but you seem to be much younger than your husband   youre not rude im very much younger  is that a problem  well its just that theres a good chance  uh youll be moving in long before she would  our concern is your wife remarries  and she wants to be laid to rest with her new husband  so she sells this spot to the highest bidder  and were left lying next to a complete stranger  without even so much as a formal how do you do  gloria tell them youre in  i dont know jay i think they have a very good point  and theyre not crazy at all  what do you mean they have a good point  i dont think this is going to work  good luck getting someone into your drawers  it occurs to me  that i may have gotten a little too upset  and jumped to some conclusions  that were perhaps not true  i realize now that you would  never intentionally do something so unthinkable  so  i just wanted to say im sorry for accusing you  i did it  i knew it you twofaced   let me explain  there is  there is no explanation there is just no excuse  i just want to know why  okay y you know how um s some women say  that they forget how painful childbirth was  well i i i think that you are forgetting  how panicked you were before we got lily   you were freaking out  i was not  okay so it says that we can put the mattress  at one of three different levels   which one should we do  i dont know  well just think about how far down she should be   how far  i dont know i cant do this  okay  oh this latch system is great  what did people do before this  i dont know stop asking me questions   cam  i cant do this i cant  okay well i  i dont see what that has to do with anything  i i was scared that that it was just gonna all be  too much for you and that you were gonna leave  and then i would be the one taking care of a baby  and half of her last name  would belong to the guy who left us  it was a mistake im sorry  i i wanted to have it changed  but i needed to get your signature  and i was afraid that it would start a big fight  and that you would hate me and  ok im confused  youre saying that if she tells me she has a problem  im not supposed to help her  not unless she asks for your help  but if she lets me help her  i can make her problem go away  that is such a male thing to say   well forgive me for being a man  mm  mango or kiwi  ooh kiwi  when you say you know do this or do that  all shes hearing is im smarter than you   believe me she doesnt think that  mm  she doesnt want you to solve her problems  she just wants you to give her support  so that she can solve her problems herself  yes and sometimes  sometimes she just wants a sympathetic ear   whoa whoa  mmhmm  maybe its all the creams  but that just made sense girlfriends  so if claire says i hate getting stuck in traffic   i shouldnt say maybe u should leave earlier  no   or dont get on the freeway  no  i should just say i know its so frustrating   yes thats it  really  yes yes  and and if she says uh uh  the waiter i had today was so rude  i shouldnt say maybe you should just order   something on the menu for once  no  i should just say what a jerk   yes yes  yeah  and if she says phil the tvs driving me crazy  i should just say i know  there is not enough quality programming for women  no turn off the damn tv  okay now im confused again  so i heard you had a rough time today  yeah well  remember the days when we thought wed live forever  dont you want to go play  when do i ever play  im kind of wrestling  with this whole older man younger woman thing  its like chloe and i grew up in different worlds  today i made a joke about the wiggles   it went right over her head  i dont know what that is  its an expression means she didnt get it  yeah it sometimes this age thing  knocks you in the head  that what this is about  i always knew your mother might remarry after im gone  that never bothered me  i figured her husbands would be your dad me  and some putz who could never live up to me  but what if im not the main guy  what if some other guy is  what if im the putz  when my mom and dad got divorced  do you have any idea how many guys chased after her  the phone didnt stop ringing  men would stop her on the street  guys would propose to her from moving cars  they were goodlooking guys jay with money  i think one of them was a kennedy  where are you going with this  when you showed up i didnt think you had a prayer  you were so nervous and sweaty i felt sorry for you  i had to climb three flights of stairs  but of all people my mom fell for you  i got a few moves  she said she fell in love with you during your first fight   what  she said shed finally met her match  oh  so if you think shes just gonna replace you  when youre gone  then you
