somebody needs to get in the holiday god rest ye merry gentlemen   son of a bitch let nothing you dismay    remember christ our savior   maybe its not them  oh its them was born on christmas day   to save us all  its them  from satans power   three years ago i formed a caroling group  we were known as the greensleevers  we would perform at charity events hospitals   nd they were very very popular  uh last year one of my carolers  andrew staged a little coup   and he um  they kicked cameron out of the group   save us all from satans power   when we were gone astray   o tidings of comfort and joy comfort and joy   o tidings of comfort and joy    thank you  were the new greensleevers    the new greensleevers  is there a slap mark on my face  i mean why is edna singing the low harmony  its like people are applauding out of shock  let it go why would  okay next ah finally  whoa  im im sorry can i could you  what happened to the other santa  listen weve been waiting in this line for a really long time  and we just want a santa that actually looks like santa  mitchell its okay no no no cam its not okay  this is lilys first christmas i want to make sure everything is perfect  and were gonna wait for the fat santa  all right i knew this would happen  ii dont even know why we hired this guy  see even his elves agree with me thank you  i didnt know christmas made you so petty  we wish you a merry christmas    we wish you a merry christmas   lackluster   we wish you a merry christmas and a happy new year   good tidings we bring  i hate you  this is unacceptable and i want to know who did this   mm  nobody huh  i guess the couch did it to itself  guess it came home after a tough day lit up a cigarette and then it burned itself  is that what happened because that makes no sense  if whoever is responsible doesnt come forward your father and i  are just gonna have to punish all three of you  what  yeah   thats not fair  i can forgive the smoking  but i cant forgive the lie no  or the smoking  no one wants to confess huh no  thats fine cause you know what happens next  we cancel christmas    thats not fair   okay dad sure  phil has a habit of making big pronouncements to the kids   one time i told luke  that if he didnt put his dirty dishes in the dishwasher we would put them in his bed   phils problem is followthrough    we had no more dishes so we were eating cereal out of the goldfish bowl  okay guess where im headed  to take down the tree thats right  come on guys this is your last chance  whoever did this just take responsibility  dont put the rest of us through this luke no  this is really it okay here we go  three two one  okay goodbye dunphy christmas  haley i guess youre not getting that car   i was getting a car  nope i was lying because thats what we do now  dunphys are liars  when i was in charge it was all about the music  i mean whats with them tossing out candy canes after every carol  its pandering i think you made that clear when you tossed them back  how am i supposed to get all this in the car   let me give you a hand with that  uh thanks  thanks thanks santa cant call me that anymore  just got canned  oh really  guess a couple people complained i wasnt fat enough  well thats terrible thats what i get for trying not to have a second heart attack  there you go always a way to make room  take it from someone who lives in his car um  oh well thank you so much  no problem merry christmas  um wait wait um please uh let me give you a little something  for your troubles no thats okay no no really  gosh really okay do you really live in your car  yeah its not so bad its pretty roomy since the wife moved out   why dont you come over to our place for dinner tonight   seriously  yeah its christmas eve  yyou cant spend it in your car  wow thats really nice of you guys  listen can i bring anything ketchup soy sauce straws  were good  so uh why dont you follow us to our house  okay in your house      all right  cameron what  okay tonight 900 sharp we open one present each  pajamas which we sleep in  tomorrow morning 700 am manny  on the stairs for the christmas picture  then we open presents  in colombia they open presents at midnight and stay up till morning  im sure that they do but as youll notice from the absence of goats in the street  we are not in colombia  come on im kidding  why cant we mix a couple of colombian traditions in   like what  like fireworks  come on you dont have fireworks in colombia  youre trying to make me the inocente again  no we do at night the sky is beautiful very christmassy   that doesnt make any sense  look every country has their own traditions  in our culture for example the baby jesus is the one  that brings the gifts not the santa claus  but that doesnt make sense how could a newborn baby carry all those presents  they dont even know where their hands are  at least a baby can fit through a chimney  how would you sit on the baby jesus lap youd squish it  manny next year well talk about some of your little colombian traditions   okay maybe  i know what maybe means  its like youre trying to take away my whole christmas  i cant believe its all gone dad never follows through  are you sure one of your friends didnt burn the couch  hey dont look at me only one of us was ever caught playing with matches  luke that was a year ago just admit you did it   you admit you did it  no  okay look i have an idea  do you remember the movie spartacus  heres what we do luke you tell mom and dad its your fault   i didnt do it  it doesnt matter  because after you confess haley and i will each confess to the same thing  how does that do anything  theyll be so touched that were protecting each other  that theyll have to bring back christmas  thats awesome  how does it work again  were gonna pass into legend   the parents who canceled christmas  i thought youd be happy  theyii write songs about us  make one of those christmas specials with those ugly little clay people  youre the one who always says i shouldnt be such a pushover with the kids   so this is where you decide to make your stand really phil  okay okay look  dont worry were going to have christmas  weve raised our kids right whoever did it will come forward  or the other two will rat em out  mom dad  hey luke what uh what can we do for you    i did it  i was playing with matches im sorry  you uh you did the right thing yeah  by confessing but um  this is bad buddy i mean really bad okay  claire you want to handle this  um luke why didnt you say something  mmm i dont know  okay well your father and i are extremely disappointed in you so  go up to your room go on  alex well be up to talk to you in a minute just go  haley what   say something  about what  uh i take it back

easter  watch your back  so after i left the marines i just kinda traveled the world  now i go from town to town picking up odd jobs  oh kinda like the hulk   thats weird that was my nickname in the corps  cause of my bad temper  anyway thanks for having me over  having me for dinner letting me do my laundry  its not been a good day   um scott ii have a confession to make yeah  um i didnt uh  i didnt clean the lint tray  so um your clothes might be a little pilly  oh no problem thats the least of my worries  thanks for everything you guys made my day   its the least we could do  what do you mean   i dont know what i was saying        i just say we never tell him exactly   we give him some money a hot meal laundry i think were square  agreed okay how does this thing work  yeah i think you just press that button right there in the middle yeah  oh my okay that  that seems a little high doesnt it  yes im not putting lily in that its like something astronauts train in   ho ho ho its me ho ho ho its me  its your dad yeah  hey dad hi hey guys hey  i brought your presents arent we seeing you tomorrow jay  these are your christmas eve gifts you know the drill oh yeah  you open those up before bedtime theyre pajamas  still keeping traditions alive huh well someone has to  i got two colombians at home trying to turn christmas into cinco de mayo  you know thats mexican right ah burrito burrighto  christmas should be christmas  picture on the stairs hot chocolate opening the presents  that was supposed to be the good thing about having a kid in the house again  i can have christmas the way we used to i hear you jay  if i was home right now id be mixin up a bathtub full of eggnog  and trying to squeeze a greased hog into a santa hat  you dont think i miss that  do you  the point is that those are memories that ill always have  but now i have the perfect opportunity  to create new memories with my new family  that are gonna be just as special someday  aw no cams right you know  we create new traditions every year  so whos ready to try the swing   okay now remind me we put this in the oven  first thing tomorrow cause jay wants to eat at 300  ay manny did you put this spider in the fridge  oh yeah inocente  ay papi whats wrong  i want to have christmas like they do in colombia jay is messing everything up  manny try to understand jay has great memories with his kids when they were young  and he just wants to recreate them with you  so maybe the best gift i could give jay would be  christmas like he used to have it  ay youre such a beautiful boy  one day youre gonna grow up and im gonna miss  all the things that you used to do as a little boy  okay but if this socalled santa claus  doesnt bring me a burgundy dinner jacket were going to have a big problem    honey hmm  would it really be so bad to back down  and have the kids never take any of our threats seriously again  yeah mmm  or the kids could realize  that were making a supreme sacrifice  by giving up our power to save their christmas  which would in a way be the greatest gift that we could ever give them  and which would paradoxically make them respect us even more   okay forget that go back one  hey guys   it it was me  what what  i found a cigarette at school  and when no one was home i i tried it  and ii guess i held it too close to the couch  im so sorry  you can take my christmas away but dont take it from everyone else  that is very noble of you mmhmm  to care about the family but you still smoked and lied  thats really bad mmm  now help me grab the tree phil  phil alex come on back  starting december 26 you are grounded for a full week  and that includes new years eve  but i was yeah nonnegotiable so  mmm yeah  fine  everybody   its official christmas is back on  it is what happened  doesnt matter stockings lights ornaments wreath  go go go okay  well that sounds like a stressful job to me  mmm not as much as youd think  they always made sure one of us had a blank so

untraditional  inocente  we remember the year mom and dad went crazy  we remember the year santa punched out the caroler  but for me this was the year that the word tradition  got a lot bigger  all is calm    theres cam  all is bright    sleep in heavenly peace   sleep in heavenly peace       ah you didnt  you got me again
