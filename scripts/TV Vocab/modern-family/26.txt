because my dead uncle joe told me to have steak tonight  no no no jay haome respect  my grandmother can hear you  what do you mean she can hear us  well in our culture  we believe that the dead are all around us  shes right manny  she could be right here  her bony fingers reaching out from the grave  yeah keep it up jay  theres already one dead person in this room  you want to make it two  im

to your sister  i think that theres something going on with her and a boy  so  so i am your mother and it is my job to make sure  that you girls dont get involved with a predator  okay mom stop watching dateline  and why cant you just talk to her  i have tried to talk to her  i  she wont talk to me you know that  thats because you get so weird every time a boy comes near us  ii just dont want you girls to   to make the same mistakes that you did no  no  mom im not an idiot  i pick up on things  and i dont think that you were the good girl  you pretend you were  wow that is so untrue  i was a very good girl mm  your kids dont need to know who you were before you had them  they need to know who you wish you were  and they need to try to live up to that person  theyre gonna fall short  but better they fall short of the fake you  than the real you  which is why we dont hide anything  thats the opposite of what i just said  i was not listening  ohh  ill say it again  i love you in paisley  oh let me lock the door and draw the curtains  what does that mean  it doesnt mean anything good  you know exactly what it means  you wont kiss me in front of other people  because youre ashamed of who you are  and yesi went there  okay you cant say yes i went there  when you go there all the time  and by the way im the one who makes speeches on airplanes  every time someone looks at us weird  im the one who gives my dad hell  when he refers to you as my friend  thats different thats confrontation  but you know what takes real strength  whining  affection oh this is insane  buying a shirt  its not a kissworthy moment  oh i didnt know there was an official list  please tell us  what is on the list  ill tell you whats not on the list   finding jalapeostuffed olives  making the light on maple  every time we see a vw  you dont like kissbuggy  its not a real game  it  its just another way for you to be needy  i  and i dont appreciate you making me feel bad  because i cant live up to your impossible standards  nobody kisses at a bowling alley  i almost got a turkey  yello  oh hey jay just a sec ill go get claire  oh actually its you im calling  what was that  the cat theres

 ugh im never going back to school now  no sweetheart yes you are you are going back to school  but listen to me   just because a boy sends you flirty texts  doesnt mean that you have to text him back  what you read my texts  i you read her texts  thats why you made me talk to her  you made her talk to me  i kind of feel like were spinning out here a little bit  look alex the important thing here  is that you have to be very careful how you behave around boys  because it is so easy to get a reputation  well im sorry im not a perfect little good girl like you were  were you ohh  were you  i highly doubt it  dont be such a chicken theres no ghost in here  im telling you my mom said  her dead grander was in the house  she said she felt her here this morning  in this room  maybe your moms

now  ay cameron its not mitchs fault  he gets it from his father  jay doesnt like the loveydovey in public either  i cant believe youre coming at me right now  im standing here with shoes around my neck  and for the better part of a halfhour  i screamed the death out of your meat  now what do you want from me dont you see  its because of you that your son cannot kiss his own lover  dont say lover we dont like lover  can we just eat  no tell mitch that its okay to kiss cam in front of you  why is that something we have to do  we dont of course we dont  oh im sorry that i dont want to make out with you  in front of my whole family  no need to apologize  oh gloria is right  dad you being so emotionally closed off  makes it very difficult for your children to show affection  really yes  you had trouble showing affection in public places  yes  you yes  was that before or after  you were delivered to my door in a squad car  wearing nothing but your underwear and a police blanket  oh my god what you were arrested  awesome not awesome  and i wasnt arrested  your grandfather was just telling a joke  it was just a joke i got a million of em  dad  i did it its printing  i had to download

gods sakes just say something  you want me to say something  how about youre welcome  how about im  im so happy to be here for you all  so i can take the blame for all your crap  i dont do this i never did that  trust me i gave you twice as much as my father ever gave me  the man kissed me one time in my entire life  he came up behind me kissed me on the back of the head  said goodnight becky

funny story to tell at dinner parties  so how long did it take before you thought it was funny  oh god   great what do i do about tomorrow  i dont think you have to worry about that  go go go  in
