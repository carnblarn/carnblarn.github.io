honest did you do that thing where you get frustrated  and you start pressing all the buttons  no  i have a theory that phil installs  overly complicated things in the house  just so he has an excuse to talk to me like a child  last month it was the thermostat  the snowflake button makes it cold cold cold   set temperature makes it hold hold hold   the little flame makes it hot    this is so humiliating  i am sorry its okay  he just seemed so mature online  how could i be so stupid  youre not stupid  stupid is not following your heart and taking a chance on love  i mean what kind of 11 yearold talks like that   mannys an old soul  here use my handkerchief  you see what i mean  ill just be alone for the rest of my life  and thats okay no dont say that  in my country theres a saying

inner beauty  its hiding beneath a mask of insecurity  okay hes starting to freak me out  manny go play  mitchell how do these look to you  like theyre dying i know right  i said something to the florist he said dont worry about it theyre gonna come back  theyre not coming back theyve crossed to the other side  you are a funny man why  youre completely bothered by the flowers  but when my father introduces you as a friend of my son  doesnt faze you in the least  because the florist played me for a fool  your dad didnt mean any harm hes just being who he is  when i was back east in law
