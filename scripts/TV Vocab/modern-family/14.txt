 okay so hehe cut you off yes  right a crazy driver  you know i used to be a little bit like that  i dont know maybe its because of lily but ive definitely become more considerate  like i used to never let people in and now i do  just now getting that metaphor okay  so what do you think were there any witnesses  no just manny he was in the back seat  okay it all happened so fast just like they
