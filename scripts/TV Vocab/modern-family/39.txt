dont like you here with my ex  you know your little intimidation game  may have worked on me when i was a kid  but im a fullgrown man now  and i think i should go  so much for keeping it all about lily  well yeah and i certainly didnt help  by berating that perfectly sweet journeyman princess  like i did  oh god look at this place  everybodys traumatized  oh we need somebody to  pump some life back into this party huh  i got this ill go in and turn on some music  bring out the cupcakes pump up the bubble machine  or  is that a roundabout way of saying  a certain clown can come to the party  i was wrong  every kid wants a clown for a dad  oh you just made a little girl very happy  yes well i can see that    you okay  im fine  i will be fine  cause you know claire gets stressed out  that stuff she said out there  was all true  yeah    i dont know what i was thinking with him  i feel like such a fool  you got flattered by the attention of a younger guy  and you got a little carried away   so what  its not that  its i divorced you  because i was looking for something else  i havent found it  but when i come back here  i feel like i have to prove something  like people are looking at me  saying you broke up the family  what do you have to show for it  you did the right thing   we were stalled  i didnt have the guts to end it  thats because youre a decent man  and that doesnt make it any easier  i just dont want to be thought of as crazy nana  thats not really who i am  i think more than anything else  my real problem  is her  huh  no dede ay qu pasa oh  ha ha so maybe it isnt about me  or me  i told you it was about me gloria no no  i got gloria  i got gloria  this is such a precious gift  i know i cant believe my dad sat down and did this  keep going   jay pay
