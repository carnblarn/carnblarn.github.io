roughandtumble guy  and i just i could never relate to him  and i dont know i just dont think i could handle  disappointing two generations  i think youre more masculine  than you give yourself credit for  who puts a birdhouse next to a porch  claire i know that youre worried  that dylan is gonna break haleys heart  but i see in his eyes that hes gonna stick with her forever  no matter what hes always going to be with her  on your deathbed  okay all right i cant take this anymore  im gonna go find her  no you push too hard you chase her right into his arms  youll end up with a boob for a
