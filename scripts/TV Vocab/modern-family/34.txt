your buttons  my fatherinlaw was the same way with me  he was horrible  grandpa lucas he was a sweetheart  yeah after the stroke mellowed him out good  before an animal  we named luke after him  everything i did was wrong  if i said it was white hed say it was black  although he never said anything was black  cause he was a pretty big racist  i wear his watch  i hated him hated him  and i was thinking i dont know  i dont want you to think the same way about me  you ever think about maybe not being a jerk to me so much  now see you got to stop taking  that stuff personally  im like that with everybody  im tough  andmean  i dont like to take guff  or peoples feelings into consideration  okay okay  i cant swear my ways the right way  i see you smiling skipping around  and i think sometimes i dont know  maybe the boys would be better off  if they were a little bit more like you  you know skipping burns more calories than running  thats  were done here  oh hey listen  he didnt tell me but whatd you do to that guy huh  did you get him  yeah i sprayed him with cologne  im sorry i asked  no but like a lot of cologne  i just like got way up in there  good boy  did you find anything yet  yes theres a whole section on biting on this mommy forum  oh good what does it say  uh my son was biting  so i got a stranger to yell at him  being disciplined by someone else outside the family  scared him into stopping   idiots  cam  what i am not hiring some hobo  to come over here and traumatize my child  shes already prone to flashbacks  if you know what i mean  yeah you know she didnt fight in vietnam right  i dont know anything anymore  what else does it say  okay well this one says  when my daughter bit her brother  i put a pinch of pepper in her mouth  she cried and cried but she never bit again  smiley face  oh well the smiley face makes it okay  i waterboarded our toddler  lol  well all right what do you suggest we do  that we log off the spanish inquisition website  and handle this with love  okay lily  take a bite of an apple take a bite of a pear  take a bite of the cookie that you left over there  heres one thing you should never do  dont bite taylor or brandon or sue  because people arent food people arent food  your friends will run away if theyre scared of being chewed  and as a side note private parts are private  well problem solved  i know youre being sarcastic  but you dont know that its not  ow honey   did she just bite you again  no  that is it i am getting the pepper  n no you are not  cam youre not doing her any favors by being soft  oh well then why dont you just skip the pepper  ill get some pliers and well pull her teeth now  relax its a seasoning  okay well then why dont you try some   stop  no try a little  stop it stop it cam stop it no try a little bit  dont you hit me here put some in there  no  ow you bit me mm well  why dont you sing me a song about it  oh look at you two in your matching ties   dont get me started  ohh come here   luke sweetie are you wearing cologne  no  dad attacked the perfume guy and then hugged me  i saw the boys in those adorable little suits  and it made me realize this dance is about them  its not about me  and my petty little competition with  with gloria  just look at the walls in here  who wears that to a kids dance  i know  she looks amazing  okay im gonna slow things down with a blast from the past  for our chaperones  oh my god  no im fine  im im fine  im fine  im fine  i need a paper towel  im sorry i didnt see you  no  of course you didnt of course you didnt  cause its glorias night  thats right  its all about gloria gloria gloria  when youre done getting married  maybe you can mop this up a little  what was that  its this damn uniform  okay we need to talk  no i am fine i do not need to talk  well youve been pushing me away the whole week  youve been fighting all my ideas  thats because this is my thing gloria  why cant it be my thing too claire  because everything is your thing  this this is the one thing that was my thing  this is my only thing  o my god this is my only thing  and then you come along and you steal my thunder  with your tight dresses and your great ideas  i was the one that all the moms looked up to  i was the only one that gus liked  ay please  you like him so much you can keep him  its not the same now that i know he likes you  that sounds really insane  but this isnt actually about gus  really  because youve been talking a lot about him  gloria gus is a symbol  a sex symbol  stop it gloria im already crying  claire  i didnt come here to steal your thunder  your thunder is your thunder and my thunder is my thunder  i know its just that god gave you so much thunder  yeah maybe too much  i hate how those women look at me  you think i dont know what theyre thinking  ah here comes the hot one  with the big boobies that is gonna steal my husband  and maybe they dont let their kids play with manny  i volunteer because i want them to see  that theres so much more to me  why didnt you tell me that  maybe for the same reason you didnt tell me  you had a wed thing for gus  its embarrassing  okay  i am sorry  i made this whole thing  into some ridiculous competition  andim pathetic  youre not pathetic  okay thats a little bit sad  we like to think were so smart  and we have all the answers  and we want to pass all that on to our children  but  if you scratch beneath the surface  you dont have to dig very deep to find the kid you were  which is why its kind of crazy  that now were raising kids of our own  you know what this is a milestone  were accepting that our little angel isnt perfect  thats right and its okay  ii take it back  she is perfect  but i guess thats the real circle of life  your parents faked their way through it  you fake your way through it  and hopefully you dont raise a serial killer  ow  thats not funny      okay see you in a bit  that was longines hes in a very bad place  oh no what happened  well apparently some maniac went crazy at the mall  and attacked him with oasis for men  oh well i think we all knew that day was coming  mm  all right  wish me luck  good luck  okay honey  please dont hurt daddy  all right  ahh
