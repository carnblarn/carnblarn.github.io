section see  they got this thing figured out  can i hit this  damn it  you dicted me  i didnt say anything  i could hear you thinking  im thinking about this heaven of yours  thats full of bad people  not full the tiniest fraction  theyre walled in  what if they break out  theyre surrounded by a lake of fire  they are fiery lakes in heaven  this is turning into hell  tell me about it  what are you doing  well you promised pepper broken dishes so  im breaking dishes  no not my frog i know you think its tacky  but i happen to have won this at my first 4h summer camp  in a hollerin contest  well

remember  one two three  mitchell wait  iii cant do this i quit  you might be comfortable with all this lying  but im not  oh please where was all this conscience  when i got us into the firstclass lounge  at the airport and you chewed angela lansburys ear off  you know what you are  youre like a mob wife  you look down at me and my ways  but youre happy to wear the mink coat  that fell off the back of the truck  how dare you  i know i know  it really hit us bad  no  im just always surprised how small this place is  pepper you didnt have to leave your party  to come check on us  great costume by the way  this isnt my costume  i just threw this on to help you clean up  well about your party  oh dont worry about canceling  at least you have an excuse  unlike steven and stefan  they said they had the flu  meantime i just saw them out riding their bicycle  oh pepper that is horrible  iim gonna make you a cocktail  oh honey dont go to any trouble  ill just have a kir royale  i mean my god if they didnt want to come to my party  just say it  im a big boy i can take it  well since you brought it up pepper  we didnt want to come to your party either  what  well you know we love you  but theyve just gotten to be so much work  over the years and  were all out of cassis  i cant bear it  i will make you a bellini  everybody canceled on me  and now you two  for 15 years  i have killed myself setting a community standard  with my fanciful themed brunches  mounted at great personal expense  well clearly ive been a fool  no one likes your brunches pepper  no one likes you  youre gonna die alone  in a quaint spanish revival outside of palm springs  or la quinta  yeah i told him  yeah yeah i puzzled that out  i just dont understand this bad section of heaven  what if they send you to the wrong place  they make mistakes with paperwork sometimes  i was put in a girls health class last year  an had to watch a very disturbing movie  calm down  instead of thinking all morning  about what heavens gonna look like  what its not gonna look like whos where  if there even is a heaven  why dont we just concentrate  on this beautiful carefree day  thats in front of us  id rather concentrate on something you just said  there might not even be a heaven  i dont know  you seemed pretty sure of yourself this morning  so what happens after you die  theres just nothing  look youre focusing too much  on one little thing that i said  it was just a hunch okay  a hunch  im skipping church based on a hunch  all right dont freak out on me here kid  youre playing pretty fast and loose with my soul  listen i want you to forget everything that i said okay  some things cant be forgotten jay  do you know what menstruation is  because i do  perfect  hey wwhat are you doing  arent you supposed to be getting mom out of the bathroom  that is what i was doing  that is what i was doing  this c this cabinet  was the problem how  yeah its very heavy  and because it was properly anchored to the wall  theres sort of a ripple effect  it was  pulling part of the floor down  and then pushing part of the floor up  using the bathroom door   please dont tell on me  i dont know who i am anymore  who am i  im a joke  thats who  no no  youre not a joke  youre pepper saltzman  i think i better just go  if anything terrible should happen  dont feel an obligation to attend my memorial  new york or la  pepper  pepper you  you didnt let me finish  the reason we didnt want to come to your party is  mitchell  seriously  whos a mob wife im a mob wife  im sorry i couldnt hear you  im a mob wife  okay um pepper  this is a little embarrassing  i dont even want to hear it  cameron still has feelings for you  go on  yeah and its just  its very hard for him  to be around you especially at your  magical brunches where youre just   youre  youre so magnetic  and then i see the way that he looks at you and  damn it pe it just makes me so mad  that i could just  ohh  really  yeah oh you dont know the pain cam  oh boys  boys i cant stand that im coming between you  not that im surprised  i admit i have noticed the stolen glances  and the yearning in your eyes  okay well yyoull forgive us pepper  if we sit out your next few brunches  absolutely  i would hate to lose you two  ive always thought of you as being like my  sons sons  sons  i was gonna say brothers  its like a house of pain  all right claire okay ready  you ready im ready  all right on go okay go  all right go okay go  go go  claire oh god i got it  ohh its moving it did it  all right we got it oh  thank god go  oh

glass  and taking care of luke after he ran into a wall  what  i got scared because the cabinet didnt fall down  mmhmm mmhmm  um  ohh im sorry  well dont worry about it no im sorry  oh i was so nervous  i freaked out  its all right its all right  i think it was a little bit of a rough morning yes  wasnt it yes it was  i dont know about you guys  but i just want to relax and put my feet up  at the museum of tolerance whos in  i am  you are okay lets do it  theres nothing mystical about an earthquake  pressure builds and its released  and you just hope theres not too much damage  but it makes you realize what matters  and for me thats my family  ill put in a good word for you  youre the best kid  my family and golf  what do you walk on  ay manny dont be ridiculous the clouds  that makes no sense clouds are air  youd fall right through them  the clouds in heaven  theyre like trampolines  mm i dont like trampolines  they make me seasick  manny stop worrying  heaven is a beautiful place  with sunshine and rainbows and butterflies  butterflies ay no no no no  ahh aah  i didnt say butterflies manny theres no butterflies
