crafts table  i finally figured out what were gonna be making  kids bored  im teasing im teasing  it looks good what is it comb sheaths  i know i know  but we made them when i was 11 years old at donna rigbys birthday party  at first we thought it was really stupid and then we had a blast so  how could you not you combined the two things that kids love the most  combs and sheaths  im kidding  wheres my comb oh  here it is in my incredibly convenient beaded comb sheath  that i made at lukes awesome birthday party  hole in one mrs dunphy  hole in one  im home  i got luke a video game but its about math  so i guess were those kind of uncles  cam  dont be mad  oh cam uh  ive known i wanted to be a clown  since i found out clowns were just people with makeup  um as a matter of fact by the time i was a teenager  if i wasnt in school or fishin i was clownin  there are four types of clowns  a tramp an auguste a whiteface and a character  i am a classically trained auguste clown named fizbo  what nnothing  between the clownin and the fishin  im surprised you had time for the schoolin  aw and theres the fifth type the sad clown  sad clown is a tramp so theres still only four types    cam i thought we discussed this  we did but i i started thinking  and this isnt about you or me this is about a little boy who deserves some happiness  and hes gonna get that from his weird gay clown uncle  fizbo is not gay hes asexual  oh hes an innocent whose only drive  is to bring people joy and laughter and balloon animals  hes hes the least sexual being on earth oh  oh okay well at least we agree on something yeah  oh   if this tape is found in the future  this is how we humans celebrated birthdays  hey dad  yeah theres my boy zipline extreme    im okay im good im good  lesson learned
