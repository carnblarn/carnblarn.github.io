moms recipe  what it says on the page goes in the pot  nothing more nothing less  now how long do i stir the beef and sausages  read it to me  you should stir the beef and sausages for five minutes  and how much longer do i have to listen  to the julia child impression  for as long as its still funny  i think the timer just went off on that  that was unnecessary  whats this  what  hey jay maybe after this  we should make the perfect mom  all we need is a tablespoon of love 1 cup of warmth  add one heart softened  what the hell are you talking about  this recipe for the perfect mom  by jay francis pritchett age nine  geez i forgot all about that  i didnt know she had that in there  whats that francis  nothing  how much longer on the meat  aw  i love the part about serves one small boy  thats adorable  wow  175 pounds of tenderness  she must have loved that big woman  jay  and thats when i saw it  jay  are   are you crying  no  its the onions damn it give me these  what are you lookin at  nothing  those really frame your face  oh wow  beautiful  ay thank you  okay i dont want you to judge me  but i have to say something  sometimes i want to punch my kids   you dont mean that  no i do i do  the last time they were horrible the way they were today  they happened to be all lined up  and i couldnt help but think  if i hit just one of them  the rest would go down like dominos   eee  i know  that would rob me of the pleasure  of hitting each one individually but  oh my god you dont talk about your children this way  oh come on you know manny irritates you  no manny is the best thing that ever happened to me  we have a special bond  yes bonds i know  but thats not what im talking about now  claire for a long time it was only the two of us  i cannot say anything bad about that boy  give a break gloria  anybody whos ever had a kid knows  that they can irritate the freaking life out of you  at some point  am i right  oh okay  hes persnickety   what  manny  hes persnickety it drives me up the wall  okay persnickety good start  he follows me around all the time  sometimes i love it  but sometimes i need my own space  this does not make you a bad mother to admit these things  and the poetry its not very good  ah first time that i say that out loud  okay  its not very good  wow  ii love manny but you know sometimes i   just be a boy  go outside kick a ball steal something  oh  it feels so good  maybe to you  no manny ay  i was talking about another manny that i know long time ago  diablo  manny  you know more people have died hiking  than in the entire civil war  ok what book did you read that in  book  wake up and smell the internet grandma  you know moms just gonna want us to apologize  well we did kind of ruin her mothers day  no she ruined her mothers day  she took us to a place she knew we wouldnt like  and then we complain for like a second  and were the bad guys  thats a good point  you ever get the feeling she does this intentionally  why would she do that   so she can make us feel guilty  exactly  and the next time were choosing what to do  she gets her way again  and the next time and the next time  and eventually its mothers day every day  wow moms really smart  well not smarter than me  well  i say we dont apologize this time  let her know were onto her little game  we could change the way this whole family operates  okay so nobody says theyre sorry  got it keep your mouths shut when she comes back  if she comes back  jay teared up in front of me  hed never shown me that kind of vulnerability  and it embarrassed him  id shamed the proud lion  only thing to do  hug the proud lion  oh i could get bit  i could get scratched  but you know whats inside every lion  a pussycat  i need you to get away from me  yep  okay im just gonna say this one time  so we can move on   its okay  gotcha  you  you know what it is  its you crying   which i didnt  you teared up  it was the onions  okay okay  maybe im  maybe im just putting myself in your place  but if i came across something from my childhood  and it reminded me of my mom i might get a little misty  maybe even want to talk about it  here  so proud  they offered me a bouquet mitchell  which you accepted  why cant you ever take my side  they think of me as a woman  cam no come on  were just a new type of family you know  they dont have the right vocabulary for us yet  they  they need one of us to be the mom  so why does it have to be me   do i wear a dress  well  thats a nightshirt  its kind of satiny  what are you saying  come on you know  no no no no i dont know  all right if  if im thinking about it  of the two of us if  if i had to pick  iii might say that youre slightly momer  excuse me can you throw that ball  can i throw a ball   you dont  you dont think i can throw a ball  cam   no no no  thats not what he said  no apparently this gentleman  doesnt think i can throw a ball  oh thats not what he said  you think i cant throw a ball well lets find out  ugh  oo god he looks old  oh sorry  cam hands  sorry  there you go  please forgive me  i dont think i can lets just get in the van  oh sorry for the rhyme  i know how you hate my poetry  please stop my suffering  say something terrible about me  so that we can be even like steven  why would i say something terrible to someone i love  i curse my tongue  im gonna intervene here  manny lets talk about what really happened okay  your mom said you should go out and throw a ball around  that cant be the first time youve heard that  no but there was some hurtful stuff said about my poetry  which your mom regrets  i do  so thats what parents are for  sometimes they criticize because it helps make you stronger  kids these days get  get trophies just for showing up  whats that gonna lead to  a bunch of 30yearolds living at home  manny your mom loves you very much  but shes a human being  so she let off a little steam  honestly its probably a great thing for your relationship   i guess i can   stop  he needs to know the real truth  manny claire was feeling bad  because she wants to hit her own children  so i tried to make her feel better  by inventing terrible things about you  you mean you dont have a problem with my poetry  no the only problem that i have  is that i never have enough of it  youre the perfect kid in every way  ay mi amor  wow thats healthy   good youre back  uhhuh  are we done  unless the you have something to say  to the person who gave you life on her special day  nope im good   my baby luke  uh  no   hey  hey   here  whats this  well its a mothers day card  and i know  stop it okay  cam that was glorias card from manny  but i just wanted you to see  was its definition for mother was on it  its warm nurturing supportive  you know maybe when the world sees you as a mom   not just the world  fine fine me too  but maybe this is what were seeing  and i dont know why thats such a bad thing  it certainly doesnt make you less of a man right   maybe youre right  yeah  come on lets join the party  and cam put down the scotch youre not fooling anyone  it is so burny oh my god  come on people everybody to the table  its just hard you know  having your mothers day ruined  i never thought it would be you lucas  dont even think about it  but shes sad  sad shes losing  she just hit you with her best shot  we
