your dads car here  mwah  its ironic that i stand up he  representing my classmates when for the past three years  most of them have treated me like im invisible  its my own fault  i was obsessed with good grades  instead of looks popularity and skinny jeans  what is that your speech  get out of here  you cannot say that  yes i can and you want to know why  cause its the truth  no one wants to hear the truth  its very simple alex  in order to give a good speech  all you have to do is take a song and say it  like dont stop believin  or get this party started  that means nothing  who cares  nobody wants to think  its a graduation  a celebration of being done with thinking  people want to be challenged  theyre gonna respect me for it  no ones ever gonna talk to you again  so what  mahatma gandhi went on a hunger strike  for what he believed in  thats cause no one would eat with him in the cafeteria  hey   hey guys were here  hey  come on over have some lemonade and cookies  jay thats not

laugh at your expense  im just saying its a character flaw  okay okay quick poll here  this morning cam fully dressed  thank god its one of those stories  while in the middle of a very serious thought  fell into a ducky pool  oh my goodness are you all right  yes i am thank you  that is a normal reaction  love and concern  okay wait wait wait wait  no  the pool popped  ay poor thing   there is nothing worse than a tailbone injury  i know i know  seriously no no no no youre so full of it  you know this is funny  picture this  falling into a tiny pool  hell be here all week folks  literally because youre not coming home with me  there she is theres my little stella  thats my girl  hi sweetie  youre so cute i just wan eat your face  you remember when you used to hold alex like that  and

fine   no no no we got to get you to a hospital  im fine  yes im taking you come   gloria no wait  vamos  wait right here gloria  gloria  gloria gloria  gloria hold on  the reason my face looks like this is because i had  botox  like the ladies use for their wrinkles  well actually nearly 10 of their sales are men  but thats not important  i had a bad reaction  hit a nerve or something  its gonna go away soon  what whats that supposed to mean  nothing  would you stop  this is very embarrassing for me  for both of us  hes fine it was a false alarm  what do you mean a false alarm  his face looks like a candle  you heard her im okay  shes not a doctor  neither are you  technically  okay look i dont know whats going on here  but there is no way that this is normal  you look like a botox job gone horribly wrong  no my god you didnt  of course he didnt  did you  no  you did  what were you thinking youre a veteran  enough this conversation is ended lets go  do you think he got his butt done

gate  oh geez not now  what whats happening  its stuck again  what do you mean its stuck cant you get it open  what do you think stuck means claire  we have to do something dad  cant you  cant you

give a speech  and graduate from middle school  and if i am not there dad i am going to freak out  i am going to freak out  maybe push it  i am going to freak out  why are you smiling  im not  im not smiling  chunchunk  hysterical wife  hysterical wife  hysterical wife  jackpot  come on  all right okay we have tried this way  i say we ram the gate kids get out of the way  hold on i think i can fix this  i just need a paper clip some olive oil  and a ribbon  whats the plan macgyver  actually the paper clip  is to connect these two circuits  and the olive oil is to lubricate the mechanism  and the hair ribbon is for lily  her hairs been driving me crazy all day  why dont we just call some cabs  because mitchell this is not times square  and theyll take forever  well then well just climb over the fence and start running  no we wont because its 5 miles away phil  and im in big shoes so no  wait wait wait wait  i save the day  lets take this crazy bicycle  we throw it over the gate  then we take phil and we take claire  and then we throw them over the gate too  all right what the hell is that  jay bought it  he thought we were gonna use it all the time  but i keep hitting my boobs with my knees  champagne problems right  honey theyre not gonna ride the bike  yeah but i still think that we should throw it over the gate  okay you know what  thank you thank you  nobody else has come up with an idea  i think ive got a good idea  we dont have time to build a rocket buddy  never mind  okay so  phil and i will go over first  and then you guys will throw over the bike  okay step up ill boost you  couldnt we get a ladder  please im cheers squad  i boosted girls bigger than you to the top of a human pyramid  now arms at your side  straight like a pencil  one two  we are bulldogs  aah  ow  shes fine  okay jay now you do me  just grab a handful dont be shy  im not giving you as much to work with  i used to have a lot more there i lost it  they used to call me the grand can  its ironic that i stand up here  representing my classmates when for the past  i read the rest of your speech  congratulations  do you hate me  what  you talk about how all the popular kids are shallow and lame  i didnt mean you  you think you have everyone figured out  but everybody has their stuff  what stuff do you have  too many boys chasing after you too many parties  you really want to know what stuff i have  yeah  im flunking out of biology  and now i have to go to summer school  my friends  all they can ever talk about nowadays  is going off to college  and i dont even know if i can get into college  is that enough stuff for you  whatever  you know what  fine give your stupid speech be an outcast  but youre only doing it to yourself  because youre smart and pretty  and sort of funny in a way that i dont really get  but other people seem to enjoy  so you can either start fresh next year  or be the freak who flipped off her class  you really think im pretty  shut up  phil go straight  this ways faster  no straight  stop leaning   do you want to drive  i do  tough i called it  doh  what was that  oh crap the chain broke  just keep pedaling it doesnt matter  it matters a little  cam please be careful  why if i get electrocuted my hat might blow right off   thatd be funny as hell right  no no  hey jay  i know youre feeling selfconscious  so i dug out something i thought might help  put that thing away  i knew youd say that but hear me out  this was designed to make  a hideously disfigured man look supercool  its perfect for you  oh yikes okay  ill go upstairs and see if i have a lefty  dont look at me like that  i have to say that i am a little disappointed  in you doing this thing  not me  i feel real good about it  now many times do i have to tell you  that you dont have to look young for me  i didnt do it for you  what is her name  stop  most of the time i walk around  and in my head im 40  then i look in the mirror  i say whos that old man  and whats he doing in my bathroom  well its my bathroom too  and i like when the old guy is there  this is the face that i fell in love with  not this face   this one  ooh ooh the gates opening the gates
