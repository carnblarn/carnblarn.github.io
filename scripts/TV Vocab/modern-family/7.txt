lets talk about why you got your panties in a bunch  whats up with you and your sister  nothing is up mmhmm  or could this have something to do with ice skating   when mitchell and claire were kids  this is interesting to no one  excuse please let me finish thank you  when mitchell was 10 eleven  and claire was 13 they were competitive ice dancers figure skaters  oh for gods sakes ill tell the story yes  my sister and i were actually a very good team  we were called fire and nice  i was fire because of the red hair and claire was nice  because it was ironic and she wasnt  and mitchell is still upset because claire quit the team right before some meet  some meet the 13andunder regional championships  just the emerald city at the end of my yellow brick road  wow you did it what  you made figure skating sound even gayer  so seeing your dad so proud of manny  didnt stir up any resentment  mmmmm oh  okay fine you always do this instead of letting your feelings out you bury them  and then they bubble up later in hurtful ways okay you know what yes  all right listen i might still be holding a little resentment but thats  embarrassing and petty and its not a good color on me  its kind of like you and yellow  you love me in my yellow shirt  it makes you look like the sun  bubbling hurtful bubbling   now you know why i left early that morning  ha  i knew you didnt have a meeting cam i knew it    there must be something wrong with this phone  ive rubbed it on my head for like an hour  what alex     oh youre such a geek  at least i didnt give myself a bald spot  oh my god mom

math   yeah of course i want luke to be successful  but i dont think that a parent can just force that  i think you just have to have faith that the kids gonna find his own way  besides luke already

boy     imim glad dads proud of manny i am  i just it would have been nice to see him that proud of us  by us i mean me   and you sincerely thought that the path to dads approval  was going to be through figure skating  mitchell i am fairly confident that dads proudest moment  was when you finally took off the flamered unitard  i am not claiming that any of this is rational  imim sorry im sorry for being such a pill okay  um actually i always felt very guilty for quitting  i know how much you loved figure skating  i never really loved skating  uh what  um all right this is gonna sound a little gay  but um whenwhen you and i skated together  you werent the mean older sister and i wasnt the clingy little brother  we were we were a team and  well lets face it weve kind of grown apart in the past few years  and with mom and dads divorce we were on opposing sides  and i i just i miss being on your team  thats  a little gay there we go  claire where are you going  claire  no way  get up  really mmhmm    dont drop me             put it away or lose it       somebodys got to put a stop to this  thats it mitchell       so can we take you and caroline out for ice cream  we cant shes diabetic  of course she is   a round of applause for our winner manny delgado   lets get out of here get this thing in the trunk  i cant decide if im feeling more proud or mortified  how about now   we tell our kids it doesnt matter if you win or lose  but lets be honest  winning feels pretty great  theres nothing like that golden moment in the sun  i think every parent probably wants that for their child   and maybe a little bit for ourselves too   sometimes we push too hard  and that leads to a lot of resentment and guilt yes yes  so how much is too much heres where i come out  guilt fades  hardware is forever  youre mad arent you im not mad  yes you are no im not  youre a little jealous im happy for the two of you  all right come on well do one stay there  for real yep  feel better yeah oh do me now come on  what are you talking about  are you serious   cam no
