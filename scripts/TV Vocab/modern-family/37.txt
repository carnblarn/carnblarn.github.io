within walking distance  is shawarma city  two shawarma combo meat or chicken  uh one meat one chicken  and can you make the chicken all white meat  number 32 pay cashier  okay thats not an answer

this is why shes so successful  shes tough but calm  because im not an idiot  as is evidenced by my law degree  which i will happily dust off and use to crush you in court  if you dont fix it replace it  or send me a check in the next 72 hours  you know what stay right there  dont move  act like you werent listening  what does that look like  im so sorry  i have to run down to the restaurant for a

broke in here its all wet inside  will you stop gasping its just a diaper  okay we need a game plan  we need to rehearse exactly what were gonna say  because that is the only way im gonna hold it together  when my babies are looking at me with judgment and disgust  first of all thats how they always look at us  oh phil  secondly this isnt as traumatic as you think  honey i walked in on my parents having sex once  it was oh awful  i cant even get the image out of my mind  claire were not your parents were in much better shape  okay you want to know the worst thing  they didnt even talk about it  they just let it hang there  im not gonna do that to our kids  phil this  this is a defining moment for us as parents  how we handle this could shape how they feel  about sex and intimacy for the rest of their lives  claire honey  honey this is only a big deal if we make it a big deal  we set the tone here so lets just play it cool  act like it was a big funny mixup  crack a few jokes lighten the mood   jokes  yeah  what kind of jokes  well this is  im just spitballin here but  what if i was all knock knock  and they were like whos there  and i was all someone who doesnt want to see  their parents doing it  thats why we knocked  again this is this is very rough  why are they still up there  yeah how long does sex take  oh my god stop talking  did you guys notice  that dad had the same look on his face  as when he smells a new car  i need to leave  i need to go to camp  this is gonna be so weird when they come down  lets just go okay come on  wait but im hungry  well get breakfast lets just go come on  lets go come on  where are you going  anywhere  where is your mother i need to talk to her  i dont think its a good time right now  she wont come out of her room  shes really upset isnt she  big time  howd you know  we called  tell me exactly what she said  i dont know there was just a lot of screaming  where was your father when all this was going on  oh he was right behind her  ugh ugh  oh its not coming out its not coming out  blot dont rub blot  we are beyond blotting and rubbing  i think weve moved on to sweating and crying  okay okay lets not panic  well just well tell amelia what happened  and then well pay to have it cleaned  what if it cant be cleaned mitchell  okay okay then well pay for a new rug  are you insane  this is a limitededition alpaca handmade stark rug  i saw it in architectural digest  it cost 50000 it was in diane keatons house  oh no it was in oh whatshernames house  um from prizzis honor  from uh oh oh she was in addams family  you know she  anjelica huston  oh yeah yeah yeah  oh oh my god 50000 for a rug  cam we dont have that kind of money  maybe she wont make us pay  i mean we wouldnt make someone pay  if this happened to us  did you not hear her on the phone  fix it replace it write me a check  she probably has that embroidered on a pillow  right next to a jar of human tears  maybe we can turn this around  how it looks like someone bled out over here  no i mean the rug  maybe we can turn the whole rug around  put it under the couch  see no one would ever know its there  well you know we would know  well  what are you thinking  you dont want to know  no tell me cause im  i think im thinking the same thing  i seriously doubt that  because now im thinking it was joan collins house  okay  great  gloria what are you what are you doing here  wait where are the kids  they just left  they told me that you were very upset  oh god and you have every right to be  it was bad  i know that  claire it was an accident  that doesnt make it any better  okay youre right i know how you feel  oh god it happened to me before with another woman  and that time i was the one getting it  and it hurt  wow  im sorry it had to come out like this  but you have to admit that youre only happy  when youre the one cracking the whip  what  come on  we all know how you ride phil  but maybe if you just let go a little  maybe even taste my cupcakes  i will join you  no unhunh no no  i i am so confused right now  i may pass out  what are you talking about  what are you talking about  the kids just walked in on me and phil i in bed  and weve just spent the last hour  holed up in our room trying to figure out what to say to them  yeah  thats what im talking about  can i use your computer i just need to check one email  yeah the kitchen  gloria i just switched us to the next flight  now did you guys get everything straightened out  claire is very upset  because the kids just walk in on them having sex  aw geez  oh then were all up to speed  shes so upset that she hasnt even had time  to apply her makeup or use her computer  w what are you even doing here dad  i dont think you should be the one  doing the questioning here missy  dont get mad at her  your wifes the one who just offered up her cupcakes  phil  good thing we had moms gas card  dont make me regret buying you that lighter dude  put it down  okay im just gonna say it  our parents are totally irresponsible  and im not just talking about us walking in  on their little freak show earlier  just let it go  no were lucky to be alive  how often do they let luke go go to school  in shorts in the winter  and they let me ride in the front seat  before i was 60 pounds  and they never shut the gate  at the top of the stairs when we were babies  do you know how many times you fell on your head do you  no  we get it it was bad  but you know i  i guess  its better than having parents who fight all the time  maybe  my friend jacobs parents are getting divorced  he has to move out of his house they told him last week  that sucks  hell get used to it  half of my friends parents are divorced  mine too  its insane  so its a good thing mom and dad still do sex  better than mom leaving the stove on  which shes done twice this month  i just realized we havent even gotten  to the worst part of it yet  which is  theyre gonna want to talk about it  well maybe not  are you kidding  their parents never talked about anything  so they want to talk about everything  yeah they called a family meeting  when we switched to 1 milk  i dont know where those kids are  what is more important  than putting a working lock on a bedroom door  you are one to talk  what is that supposed to mean  you dont remember  when i walked in  on you and mom that time  gloria can we please go now  mmhmm mmhmm  so why dont you just get off your high horse dad  at least i am trying to handle this  better than the two of you did  what did we do  you made gimlets and went back to your room  what were we supposed to do  you you you could have talked to me  you could have made sure that i was okay  want to talk about it  yes fine  your mother and i were watching  a particularly racy episode of hart to hart  stefanie powers had to go undercover as a call girl   mnhmnh dad  hang on  this whole story makes more sense  if you know i got a thing for thighhigh boots  oh gross gross you are ruining sex for me  and boots  hey  working okay for you  oh yes  i was sending an email to my brother in colombia  oh  um i was telling him about claire  you know i realize theres so much i dont know about her  like for example what is her favorite word  or what was her first pets name  gloria im not an idiot  are you trying to get claires password  okay fine  i sent her something by mistake  i need to get into claires email  to erase it before she sees it  before i see what  hola claire  hi gloria  before i see what  its so embarrassing  you see jay and i  its a naked picture of gloria  whoa  yes  naked  mm  i was gonna send it to jay  you see everything the whole body   i need to sit  okay  wow dad  so you just got done giving me a lecture  on the importance of locking my bedroom door  while in my house to retrieve naked pictures  that your wife accidentally sent me  the irony is just occurring to me  mm mm  what are you doing  what im doing is deleting it  good for you  lets go to vegas  ciao  do us a favor no pictures  oh gloria listen  we do need to talk about the bake sale at some point  i have some concerns   of course you do  yes  byebye  what do we do now  okay im really afraid  of reading this situation the wrong way  but im 80 sure youre coming on to me  okay now 40  mitchell we need to make a decision  it was the perfect plan  turn the rug and she wouldnt find the stain for years  but we couldnt do it  were too honest  there are certain moments in life that define you  and this is one of those moments  oh guys im so sorry that took so long  oh my god what happened here  jackson did it  he grabbed lilys strawberry juice and started drinking it  what before we could stop him it was all over everything  oh my god oh my god we are horrible people  im only following your lead  yeah so close that you stepped on the back of my shoe   come here jacksons allergic to strawberries  what  his throat will close up and he can go into anaphylactic shock  i need to inject him right now   oh are you sure  he seems all right to me  yeah maybe just get him some fresh air  stop talking he really hates this  and so im gonna need you  to help me pin down his arms and his legs okay   you know what  jackson honey  mommys so sorry to have to do this   amelia   but its only gonna hurt for a second   his arms  oh   okay hurry  here we go  one two   wait  wait  jackson didnt drink the juice  i stepped on lilys bag and a juice box fell and we panicked  because we heard you on the phone  and we cant afford joan collins rug  we are so so sorry we could not feel any worse  oh no thats bad  number 19   yeah yeah  number 19  oh uh can we have some napkins please  all out of napkins  paper towels in bathroom mitchell  he knows your name  and uh im just gonna say it  im really sorry about what happened  well were were not sorry about what happened  were sorry that you saw what happened  yeah okay they they get that  lets see  uh no one wants to see their parents  shhh   your sensuality  not dressed  oh  basically its two adults  adults  its like youre shaking hands  mmhmm  but youre not using your hands at all  i cant handle a big family talk about this  were not gonna have a choice  so when they start talking  just smile and nod and think about something else  yeah its easy just like at school  yeah  so i i guess what im saying here  is that as you get older  and explore your sexuality you will discover  that as long as you are in a committed relationship  with consenting adults  theres really nothing to be embarrassed about  and lets face it your mom cant keep her hands off me  whenever the gun show comes to town  good one dad  humor makes difficult situations easier  wow really  totally  you talked to us on our level but without being condescending  we did  all right  i guess we did  ha  yay us  i think we really handled that well  me too you were excellent  you were pretty good  ohhh wow  ugh this is such a weird day  i know it  by the way  happy anniversary  it always is  mmm  hey mom can i get  oh my god enough  hey whats this  your anniversary present   aww  thats very sweet  my goodness  what is it  a door lock  how embarrassing  thank you   well use it all the time  mm  we thought the lock was a really good idea  but the problem is it makes a noise  a loud noise  ugh  its hard for me to look at dad afterwards
