story about him  hes been stuck on second base forever  and im pretty sure hes gonna try and steal third  which is justa terrible terrible idea how are you and haley doing  i wish i could stay home with you and fly toy airplanes  these arent toy airplanes these are models and theyre very complicated  you want to fly one of these you got to be familiar with airfoil  drag lift and thrust and these are all principles of aerodynamics  the box says 12 and up  what  you can fly planes with jay next time today you have to spend time with luke   why  his mother invited you so you go  family needs to be close right jay  im pretty sure this is a typo  men need their hobbies mannys father had many hobbies  like hiking in the desert  that kind of skiing that they drop you from the   how do you say in english the  helicopter  once on a dare he even boxed with an alligator  wrestle you wrestle   you cant box with alligators  are you sure  how would they get the gloves on those little claws  arent they like tiny little hands   i forgot what we were talking about  anyways  hobbies are important for the men  whether youre risking your life  or flying little planes from a safe distance   wait what are you doing  were gonna buy some diapers  itll just take a second  this is costco  yeah which is where we buy diapers  since when  do you rember when we adopted that baby a few months back  since then  mitchell is a snob  no im discerning  official slogan for snobs  when we first met he wouldnt even look at me because i was  a hick from the farm in missouri and hes a big city mouse  who says city mouse  country mice  i think im gonna go wait in the car  on your way out can you grab the garbage   i got it  okay we got it   hes a little jumpy  go figure  a teenage boy doesnt want to hang out with his girlfriends dad  i thought we were past all that im all about  im all about taking it to the next level  really  i thought you were all about keeping it real  the whole point of keeping it real is so you can take it to the next level  did you not know that  you havent exactly taken it to the next level with my dad   what are you talking about  weve been married for 16 years  and you still walk on eggshells around him  what  are you kidding  jay and i are total buds  you want to just hang out  brought six friends so that just  lets    manny brought his favorite game to play with luke  its called empire  you use strategy to expand territories and take over the world  luke is gonna love that hes out back playing  do you need me to get you something while im out shopping  thats such a nice offer but i think were good thanks  what about this  you dont even say hello to gloria and manny  hi gloria and manny   okay mom what about this  no youre wearing a dress  mom come on  what its gonna kill you to look like a girl for one afternoon  its a wedding for some friend of yours that i never even heard of  its non negotiable you can borrow a dress of haleys again  that sends an ugly message  that im haley  you know instead of trying to force me to wear a dress  why dont you worry about getting luke to wear some pants  what  why does he do this  pants come on  jay and i are buds for sure  but with kind of an invisible asterisk  hes not uh hes not a talker  or a hugger  once he ran over my foot with his car  to be fair he had just given up smoking  but basically were buds  do you have to just stand there youre making me feel uneasy  oh for gods sake sit here  hold this wing like this while i adjust this  come on here  not too hard  why dont you come shopping with me  maybe i can help you find something that you like  thats a really nice offer but its not really her thing  actually id love to go  see you dont know what my thing is you have no idea what my thing is  i know what your thing is your thing is to provoke  just like your sisters thing is to never come out of her room  and your brothers thing well theres your brothers thing  put em on  the thing about me and jay is  our relationships always been stuck  in that primal place where it started  you know hes the old silverback protecting his females  then along comes this younger stronger gorilla  swinging in beating his chest  naturally the ape ladies come running  presenting their nice scarlet behinds  papa ape wants to stop all that but he cant  thats thats life  im not the enemy  the enemy is poachers  thatll do it  dont touch it  all right   you want to go fly it  sure  i got the toothpaste and the soap  good now we can open that general store   we were just here to get diapers  we had a saying on the farm  if you bring the mule to the market i feel you rolling your eyes at me  we met at one of peppers legendary game nights  i remember mitchell because he kept rolling his eyes   every time i would get boisterous  i did not  a little bit  yeah maybe a little bit  we were playing charades and i had no idea how to act out my clue  and all i could think of to do was   without missing a beat cam says  casablanca   all i did was this  casablanca  casablanca  can we get the diapers and get out of here  fine but i want to stop by the wine section first  wait theres a wine section  yeah a really good one just past the tires  no way they do not have  oh my god  oh my cam cam  the paper shredder i wanted huh confetti and crosscut  oh my god amazing  what is this place  those cookies smell like heaven your own recipe  no i just throw them in the oven  and added the secret ingredient of caring  sure  so you and luke having a good time  i dont know he wont come out of his box  maybe ill just stay here and spend some time with my sister  right i guess technically i would be your stepsister  my mother says we are never to use the word step  because it means not real and we are a real family  so what is the matter claire  what  you seem sad  its just stuff with alex you know kid stuff  ugh kids  you dont have to tell me my school is full of them  i was thinking after lunch we can go and do a little shopping   im not getting a dress  i dont care im not your mother   i know youre my grandmother  stepgrandmother  anyways today think of me as a girlfriend  two girls out for an afternoon of fun  what do you usually do with your girlfriends  i dont know we go out we talk   drink wine  can i drink wine  some friend  you can still talk to me about anything  yeah adults always say that but they dont mean it  when my mom says i can ask her anything i really cant  she just freaks out  i wont freak out  shoot   how many men have you slept with  eight next  now can i try it  i should get one of those ive always loved planes  if things had gone differently in my life i would have been a pilot  what would happen if you turned the remote off and then back on real fast  yeah you would have been a great pilot  so can you do a loopdeloop   if i wanted to  no way can i try it  i can see why you like this its so peaceful  its like the whole world just  disappears out here   i remember this one summer  ill tell you what  theres a trick threading the needle claire and mitch played at it as kids   you wanna try  how does it go  you grab one of those hoops over there  and go to the far far far end of the field  and stand there and i fly the plane through it  that sounds awesome  and then i get a chance flying it  hows this  not far enough go on  further down   you cant go too far  right okay i get it i get it   hows this  good  now stand still  dont move  lets do it  i love it  i love  it   you drove a plane into my face  you must have moved   i told you to stay still  i didnt move  try not to talk i want to make sure nothings broken  alex and i cant just disagree she has to turn everything into a fight  a strong independent woman  sounds like somebody else i know  i was never hostile though this whole thing with the dress  never had this problem with haley  maybe alex doesnt want to compete with her big sister  maybe shes trying to create her own identity   put her in a dress and she disappears  for one afternoon  i wouldnt give up being myself for even one second  sometimes its hard to remember youre only 10 years old  and threequarters   its mitchell do you need olives  olives   really good olives  yeah  you got it  mitchell i found the diapers theyre over here  cameron guess what i found  coffins  they sell baby formula and they sell coffins  you can literally buy everything you need from birth to death  look at these diapers look how cheap they are  we should get enough for like the next year or two right  where would we keep them   they sell sheds  really you want to buy a diaper shed  were those guys now the guys with the diaper shed   just grab two more  im not grabbing two more time to go  come on

did you do it to look sexy no did you do it for a guy  does grandpa like it  no no and yes  thats gross  lets go back to your piercings  ive answered enough of your questions now its your turn to answer one  what is it  why you dont want to wear a dress  because i dont want to look like haley and her stupid friends  i wear dresses and i dont look like haley  you are haley  just 40 years older   10  20  deal   alex why are you fighting me on this  it doesnt matter if i dress up  im not pretty like haley and you   thats ridiculous youre beautiful  im not  but thats okay  im the smart one  the cute busboy doesnt know that youre smart  what  hes been smiling at you every time he comes to the table  why do you think we are the only people with bread  look one day  you are going to want to date a cute guy like that  when that day comes youre gonna want to look beautiful  and then youll wear a dress  so you ever kiss another girl  thats no way to talk to your grandmother  was my mom hard on me growing up  yeah she was but you know what  back then everything was betty friedan and gloria steinem   they didnt understand  hola were back  howd it go  it was great did you have fun with luke

16 years weve been married  have you one time told him that you liked him   not in those exact words no  no not in any words dad  how do you think that makes me feel  youve never told your son that you love him  when did we jump to love   and hes technically not my son  that means that you dont love manny  sure i do believe me when i was in that park  i really wished manny was there  for what so that you could fly the plane into his head  dad thanks so much for bringing phil home  i found one of your little flaps in his hair   actually this is called an aileron  cause thats what matters right

think i strained something  i always wanted a daughter  to dress her up in pretty dresses do her hair  her nails her makeup  no one knows this but for the first year of his life  i made up manny like a girl and told everybody that he was my daughter  but just for a few times  i didnt want to mess with his head  when he found the pictures i told him that it was his twin sister who died
