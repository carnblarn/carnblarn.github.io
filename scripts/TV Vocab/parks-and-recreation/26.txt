teach back then  really  i thought there were female teachers way before then  not  my department  well times have changed  imim deputy director now but im hoping someday  to be the first female director of the department  oh i dont think thats a good idea  women uh need a lot of blood  toto flow through to to the baby cents  which leaves less to the brain you see  yeah mmhmm sure  id stay away from leadership roles  uh for your own safety  no no  hey maybe i should write a song about a picnic  ooh whered you come up with that idea  the picnic were having  i already have the perfect title  life is a picnic  thats good  how about life is a picnicwith you  whoa then it could be about a girl  or peyton manning  hmm you want to help me write thlyrics  yeah totally  we should grab a drink after this at tuckers  yeah i would do that that sounds fun  i just have to um get my stuff from the office  but thats that would be cool  david what was it exactly  that called you to the parks department  well i was in public works for eight years  but the director was pretty young  clarence was old and weak  so i put in for a transfer swooped   and pushed him out  uh there was no other reason you wanted the job  no just the money and the pension  the actual jobs a nightmare  i mean who gives a crap about thisrap  well david i think weve talked enough  mark thats great bobby great  ann you look miserable  terrible terrible  come on ann what are we doing  maxim or good housekeeping  im not sure which one is the insult  hey if theres anyone out there  thats doing a photo shoot

grab me one too make it an apple  mark great job you can have a juice box too  ann take a walk with me  in a million years i never thought  you would be the problem with this photo shoot  didnt you just plan this like two hours ago  i just dont get it  how could someone so hot be so bad at looking hot  im sorry im not a professional model  and screaming make your face better doesnt help  well im sorry your face just isnt working  and we need to do mething  to distract from this ring area  now i didnt want to have to do this  but we may have to go nude   goodbye tom  fair enough  i totally

know im working on my welcome letter  for the summer catalog  you should just copy the eagleton one  i used to just copy the eagleton one  did you  i was hoping that maybe you could talk to me a little bit  about how the department has changed since you ran it  well i think youve done a wonderful job  maintaining the parks  thank you michael i appreciate that  did you enjoy your turn at the helm  oh in a way  um pencilpushing wasnt really my thing  but i did love the parks themselves  that was the best part of the job  oh isnt it i totally agree  well thank goodness for you  yes thank goodness for michael  are you still on parole by the way  oh ha ha very funny ron   yyyes ron i am  what  he smoked pot in the office  and in all the parks constantly  in fairness to me it was a different time  it was the early 90s but also its ridiculous  that marijuana is illegal  thomas jefferson grew hemp  alcohol is legal but pot isnt  that makes sense to you ron  im sorry i cant hear hippies  so if you had to sleep with one of the old guys  who would it be  the super old one   really  mmhmm  im an eyebrow girl  i want to make out with him and chew his eyebrows off  that is  really gross  anybody got any water  oh i want water im so old  i need to drink water   oh stop it  stop taunting him  i dont need your help jailbird  if theres any unclaimed meat or cheese  i would like to claim it  yeah like you claimed my job  yes exactly like that  in that i wanted it and then i took it  okay guys you know what i would love  id love if anybody just said something positive  aboutoh i dont know anything  i agree lets just relax smoke another j  and all calm down  another  by the way its ridiculous that pot is illegal   oh  it grows  in the ground  ive planted marijuana in community gardens  all over the city and it hasnt hurt anyone   what  you know michael  you are one potloving  motherpain in the rectum  okay stop it stop it  youre all being awful horrible men  uhoh  your

mark looks happy  ugh just  please dont use these okay  lets grab some dinner  sure  hey ron you want me to read you  what i have so far in my welcome letter  nothing  because you and your jerk predecessors  didnt give me anything to work with  did you  print this out  i heard the printer going  yes  you couldve just handed me a blank piece of paper  oh wisdom finally  thank you so much  you can also keep the photo thanks for the memories  good god  i dont remember this  that thats the wrong one  but the real ones very bad as well  i want you to know that im replacing  the welcome letter with this ad  for yearning by dennis feinstein  so goodbye distilled wisdom of 50 years of experience  hello disgusting fragrance flap   let me buy you dinner  no  i insist you buy me dinner  get a drink or whatever its cool   id  im 24  no youre not   okay im 25  no old jokes please  id  it says right here youre 20  seriously  youre not even gonna show me a fake  sometimes the confidence confuses people   youre good bro  you know what  i think ill just  im gonna  um hey  um i know another bar that always letslets me in  if you just want to go there  if you want to go do that uh yeah actually  i should be going home  i got a lot of stuff to do  so i should go home  clean and stuff  but  yeah okay cool yeah i got to  go home too so  all right  see ya  later  the usual marta  me too marta   you got it  oh ron  i really made love to the pooch on this one  screwed the pooch  i dont like that term its so vulgar  ron  that sucked today im sorry theres no other way to say it  theyre a bunch of career bureaucrats  what did you think they were gonna say to you  leslie you are the next link in a wonderful chain  that stretches back to when our town was founded  and we believe in you and we support you  and well be following your career  you are the chosen one  or something  well okay so that was the problem  no you know what the worst part is  is i want to be parks director  but every single person who was parks director hated their job  and hated everyone they worked with  are we gonna hate each other someday   i dont think so  huh  i think were gonna be fine  anyway the points moot  because youre park director now  and youre not going anywhere  and im not making you go anywhere  im not gonna stab you in the back or anything so  maybe i should go somewhere  maybe i should move to eagleton  oh god the thought of that  leslie you dont have to move to eagleton  when i become city manager  my job is yours  of course my first act as city manager  will be to propose eliminating the parks department  although i expect a spirited debate with leslie  who knows what the future holds for me  maybe ill leapfrog rons job and become city manager  of course my first act as city manager  would be to double the size of the parks department  although i do expect a fight from ron  but ill win  mmm oh thank you darling  oh why would anybody  ever eat anything besides breakfast food  people are idiots leslie   mmm  mmm   the wait is over  oh yay  yay look whats here  what we got  my fellow pawneeans  yes its here  the parks departments summer catalog has arrived  and for the first time in 20 years tennis is back  peruse this wondrous book at your leisure  and take advantage  of everything this great town has to offer  time is fleeting my fellow pawneeans  make the most of it while you can  i recently had the honor of spending an afternoon  with every living former parks director  and they taught me a valuable lesson  theres nothing more important than friendship  its a little flowery  shut up  i got to hand it to michael  his waterpipemaking skills were most impressive  i once saw him smoke pot  out of a 20foot length of garden hose and a milk jug  that guy made a water pipe out of a stuffed raccoon   no way  no im not kidding  he made a bong out of a taxidermied raccoon  i caught him smoking pot out of it  not three feet from where were standing  oh nice shot  right in clarences ancient junk   oh  oh  in the neck
