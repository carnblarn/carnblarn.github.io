paintings in it  some are big some are small  people did them and they are here now  i believe that after this is over  theyll be hung in government buildings  why the government is involved in an art show is beyond me  i also think its pointless  for a human to paint scenes of nature  when they could just go outside and stand in it  anyway please do not misinterpret the fact  that i am talking right now as genuine interest in art  and attempt to discuss it with me further  end of speech  and this is the tv room  oh my god  yeah its a mess  could you throw that in the trash can  i was just here like three weeks ago for your wedding  what happened  i dont know burly moved out  he was the one that did all the cleaning  and throwing away and stuff  wait he moved out like a week ago  you guys made this mess in a week  well i always think aprils gonna clean up   and i never clean up  its cute right   no  yes it is  are you guys frying marbles  we were checking to see if the fire alarm worked  it doesnt  the biggest challenge to picking  the perfect roommate  is finding someone whos willing to pay  more than their share of rent without knowing it  i think we found that in ben  you forgot to paint a painting son  so for my painting  i chose one of my very favorite greek myths  the centaur goddess dyaphena slaying a great stag   its uh stunning  its breathtaking jerry   yeah really is  wow thanks guys  hey leslie you should really come over here and look  at jerrys painting  oh oh my god  thats me is that me  what no  oh jeez it does look like you  youre just realizing that now  thats what you see when you close your eyes  at night jerry topless leslie glued to a horse  okay leslie i am just so so sorry  dyaphena she is this powerful goddess  and ive been thinking a lot about powerful women  and subconsciously i painted you  im sorry im gonna take it right down  no leave it up  i love it  i dont know how to explain it  every time i look at it i just think to myself  what cant that centaur woman do  besides ride an escalator and drive a car  art can be so magnificent  oh my god the baby is tom  what  this is easily my favorite painting ever  what the hell jerry look at my potbelly  i look like a pregnant baby and why am i so scared  all right we got to take this down now  isnt going anywhere tom no this painting  its staying right here  hello fellow

feeling good  theyre gonna hang that painting in a public building  where anybody can see it  in one brushstroke jerry has killed  the jayz vibe thats taken me years to cultivate  and replaced it with a fat brown baby vibe  which is not as cool of a vibe  hey aphrodite chris needs you in his office  hmm  when youre done with the light fix the printer  i dont know how to fix printers  learn it   leslie should i go too  this isnt about you jerry  its my painting  why am i upset  uh lets start with governmentfunded  animal porn  oh im not sure thats fair  i want it destroyed and i want a statement  from this office apologizing for an obscene depiction  of bestiality  bebestiality  it is a picture of a centaur  a beautiful half person half horse  and how did it get like that  who had sex with what and gave birth to which  miss langman we hear you we understand you  and we are going to do whatever we can  to come to a solution  destroy it  destroy it i mean is she serious  do you find this personally offensive  not personally no  no personally i enjoy a good artistic depiction  of the human form  ive dabbled in nude sculpture  ive posed nude  in college i was in a nude production of cats  mm  but i am not in the nude now am i  because were in a government building  and that would be inappropriate  which is what i think marcia is saying  so take care of the situation  that painting is not gonna be destroyed  every great work of art contains a message  and the message of this painting is get out of my way  unless you want an arrow in your ass marcia  morning roomie

were gonna clean this place up okay  and then im going to teach you how to be adults  cool well get to be adults  gee golly thanks mister  fork  hello im perd hapley  and welcome to ya heard with perd  todays show begins now  is this art or is it pornography  here to answer this question  is parks and recreation deputy director leslie knope  perd it is a beautiful work of art  governments should not be in the business of censorship  especially when a painting is as awesome as this one  but this is where the controversy  of this story gets even more controversial  you are the subject of this painting  half woman half horse  with what some would say are human breasts  i am not the subject  the subject is strong and empowered women everywhere  but itit does look a little bit like me  leslie for our viewers at home who might not know  are centaurs real   no  you absolutely sure  okay so you always separate your lights  from your darks  thats racist  and then you get your laundry d  wheres your laundry detergent  right here we are  okay this is uh bubble bath  you guysyou wash your clothes in bubble bath  eh bubble bath clothes soap same thing  no its not  well they both make bubbles so  it was never our intention to offend anyone  i guess some people object to powerful depictions   of awesome ladies  okay  also joining us today is a different person  pornographic film actress brandi maxxxx  pleasure to be here  brandi youve starred in over 200 adult films  some which are very good  whend you get in the business   last year  fantastic  now this painting right here art or pornography  perd i think this whole debate is ridiculous  what leslie and i do is obviously art  oh hang on  um theres a big difference between an oil painting  of a greek myth and a pornographic movie  its okay leslie i got this one  what  what leslie and i want people to know  is you should be able to have sex anywhere you want  and show it anywhere you want  whether its girlongirl action  bondage or what have you  okay hang on  pornography is very difficult to define  um in fact it was justice stewart  who once said i cant define pornography  but i know it when i see it  brandi how would you define pornography  for me its when the penis goes in  all right we need to do some basic organization  where do you put your bills when they come  i read the magazines and give the rest to andy  which i organize into a pile or stack  that i put into the freezer   why  so they wont get lost  bingo  okay you have to pay these  good thing i didnt lose them  okay new lesson basic finance  im gonna teach you how to balance a checkbook  okay i am going to teach you how to open a bank account  bank account good  brandi im thomas haverford  i just wanted to say i thought you made  some excellent points up there  i totally agree with you that people should be allowed  to have sex in public places  you look familiar to me  hmm maybe youve seen me down at the snakehole lounge  im a partowner there  thats you in the painting  youre the fat baby  aww thats so cute   oh youre into that  no  damn it jerry  imagine my horror  im hanging upsidedown with my gravity boots  watching perd  i see you with your painting  and i am startled and disappointed  well i did not know that brandi was gonna offer me  a role in her next film  i urge you not to take that role  im not going to take the role  thats good to hear because recently  youve been a little unpredictable  im sorry that im trying to defend  a beautiful work of art   thank you leslie  stand down jerry   this isnt your fight  youve left me no choice  ive convened a meeting of the public arts commission  and we will abide by their decision  fine with me  public art commission filled with hippies  who love public art and sometimes weed  jackpot  i would just like to introduce myself  my name is chris traeger  and i am a big fan of art  council i am not opposed to pornography  in fact you could say im definitely for it  if i had my laptop with me right now  i would show you a wellhidden folder  with gigabytes of proof  however this thing is disgusting  and wrong  please let the record reflect that the fat baby  is referring to the painting  hey i am not a fat baby im a small slender man  similar to actor taye diggs  so let the record reflect that  that i look like taye diggs  members of the public art commission  good afternoon and good art  every great society has always supported  artistic expression   the romans  perverts   the greeks  gay perverts  to great societies in europe  europeans  there are some members of this community  that would like to demonize this painting  and when they do  they in fact demonize art itself  what is or isnt art is up to every freethinking american  to decide on their own  uh yeah its in the bag  weve decided that the painting  should be destroyed   yeah burn it  whoo  what are you serious  youre supposed to be in favor of public art  yeah well there are nipples in it  so it just seems like we ought to be safe and destroy it  okay here is a list of errands  and things that human adults need  also im giving you an advance  on next months rent  and i want you guys to go to bed bath  beyond  and buy everything on that list  or we could buy a wii  you can handle this  i dont know man  why dont you just do it  no i cant iihave a date  ooh whats his

this  burn it publicly or burn it privately  and i put the footage on my blog or  youve made your point okay  look this painting is very important to me  it doesnt need to hang in a government building  just let me take it home and ill keep it there  what do you say  i say this painting is going to burn  first here then in hell  do i need to get this validated   i donti dont know  no  okay

hate them  and i dont want to buy all this stupid boring  adult stuff and become boring adults  hey listen to me  yes were gonna get a dish rack  and shower curtains and a cutting board  but if you think for one second  im not also gonna get that marshmallow shooter  so that i can shoot you in the face with marshmallows  when youre asleep  then youre the dumbest woman i know  youre gonna make me cry  youre a levelheaded person what do i do here  well i dont know  i mean it is one of the basic rules of government  that you shouldnt offend people  yeah i guess youre right  i just im so annoyed
