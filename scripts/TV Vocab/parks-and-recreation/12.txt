remote controlled car  something more plausible than that but fast   would you break the rules  i wont murder  thats good to know  but its actually very simple  if you wanna fill in the pit just go

the pit filled in  then go rent a bulldozer and fill in the freaking pit  whats up  say you had a friend who wanted to do something good but a little risky  and she was kind of nervous  and this friend is me what should i do  you should do it  and ask your friend to help you  because your friend totally has your back   and that friend is me  youll help me  of course ill do anything i can to help  lets do it  what are we doing is it dangerous  were not gonna murder anyone  it was crazy i didnt get a single permit  nobody stamped anything all i did was order a backhoe  and it came with a guy who runs it  ive never rented a guy before  wish i knew about that during prom  there was a girl at my prom who was known as the backhoe  mary dunbar shed let anyone massage her back  im so

giddy  im so proud of us  ms montegue you ready  i didnt wanna tell him my real name you know  first speech easy important moment here  we are about to fill this hole now  not with dirt  but with the courage of a thousand lions  and the solemn memory of all of our friends  who have fallen in this cursed hole  dump it  what the   im okay  that beeping was sure annoying but this is even more annoying  ill handle this  the monitor is not a toy andy  anything is a toy if you play with it  chalk that up to your concussion  well the good news is your cat scans clear  cool  andy im really happy youre okay leslie was worried too  we shouldve checked before to see if you were home  i moved out i had to go back cause i forgot my headphones  and i layed down on this really comfy tarp  i saw an old cereal box i hadnt read before  so i mustve drifted off  next thing you know  dirt  scoot up for one sec  and back down  there you go  that is perfect  its like im lying on a cloud  this is awesome  ann and andy just like old times  the pit works in mysterious ways  im sorry about andy but im not sorry about what i did  whats my crime  i got bold  and a little negligent  my office now   can i smoke in here  you dont smoke  just asking if i can  are you high  im high on kaboom  dont ask for permission ask for forgiveness  thats right you never did ask me for permission did you  im sorry to burst your kabubble  but i just had my ass kahanded to me by the city manager  and now this entire department is kascrewed  ron im so so so sorry  what the ka were you thinking  i would prefer that she ask me for my permission  so i can say no  i like saying no  it lowers their enthusiasm  so i brought you some clean clothes that i found at my house  my god my sexy sweater it has a hole cut out over the bicep   thank you  no problem  no acakes seriously  thank you  youre welcome  what do you what do you think is happening right now  a tragic accident  reignited feelings  you thought were long dead and we are finally back together  andy were not back together  you know that im kind of with mark now  god is that still happening  i dont get it   what does he have that i dont have  are you serious  everything  he has literally everything that you dont have  a job a car  a steady income  an address  a second pair of shoes table manners  the ability to say tampon without giggling  mark has his life together  ill get you a different nurse  its awful what happened to andy  but sometimes when you make an omelet you gotta break a few eggs  whats the alternative no omelets at all  who wants to live in that kind of world  maybe birds  then all their babies would live  hi scott braddock city attorney   i didnt know that you were friends  i never met him  what i do know is that he could sue us at the drop of a hat  i mean right now he is the most dangerous man in pawnee  is that all you lawyers think about  lawsuits and laws and legalese  you can relax  all im gonna do is go in and just say  were so sorry its entirely our fault  you cant say any of that it admits liability  you cant say im sorry or i apologize it implies guilt  thats insane i have to apologize andy was the victim   cant say victim  of an unfortunate  cant say unfortunate and situation   i cant say the word situation  no it implies there was a situation  can i give him the pig  pigs fine  hi andy  got this for you  hope you squeal better  this is my friend scott  andy i just wanted to say i am so so so  filled with emotions  as any person would  what  no miming   you were in the pit  were not conceding that point  you were in a place  were both here now  the government   we gotta go  what   come on  wendell adams  im andrews attorney   its my only option  andy stop  ive advised my client not to speak with you  hes suing the city of pawnee  youre suing your home town   can we just talk about this  leslie no   this is terrible  dont say terrible  dont look back  andy its leslie  hello andy its leslie  psych leave a message after the beep  andy its leslie  look what did you mean when you said its your only option  i think we should talk  without lawyers present  if you wanna meet just put a white chalkxon the mailbox  across the street from city hall  or call me back just call me back  why arent you returning my calls  is it because of your lawyer  hey andy its your aunt  your mom or dads sister  i dont know how to tell you this but  your uncle has passed  hes with jesus now  so were having a memorial in 30 minutes  at city hall  hey free guitars at city hall everybody run  because of a local disaster  you  andy dwyer  must go to the evacuation center  at pawnee city hall  that was weird  how long have you been there  i promise that andy isnt suing just for the money  leslie the man lived in a pit  he couldnt find a place to live on the earths surface  so he went under the ground  youre dealing with a grown man who thinks like a gofer  i feel like if i could get past the lawyers  and find out whats really going on i could get him to drop the lawsuit  ann is that you  we need to talk somewhere private  baby im back  thank you so  why are you naked  because of what you said were getting back together   no were not  yes we are  you shouldve heard the sexy stuff she said  i said hey andy its ann can we talk at my house  thats not how you said it you were like hey andy its ann  can you talk at my house  my god youre such a baby literally  big naked baby put clothes on  you know what i shouldve seen this coming  has he showed up naked before  anniversaries birthdays holidays   good luck  where are you  none of your clothes fit me  so im putting an apron over the front stuff  is she gone  what did you mean when you said this was your only option  well im completely broke  and my lawyer said it could be worth upwards of 100000  i cant believe that youre suing for the money  i want ann back and she said she needs a guy with a lot of money   that doesnt sound like ann  i cant really do her voice  but she said she likes mark because hes a grownup  with a bank account i put two and two together  100000 i can probably get a bank account  sometimes i think the right thing to do is to not take shortcuts  i tried to fill in the pit  that didnt work either  fine  ill get a job  ann will respect that  i can make six bucks a day playing guitar in the street   i cant make six bucks a day  wait a second  i know i just said that shortcuts are bad  but i kind of just thought of an awesome shortcut  mr dwyer were very happy that youre dropping the suit  its really terrific  i have my conditions  never i will not negotiate with greedy street people  wait leslie lets hear him out  we planned this  all right whats it gonna take  one  i want that pit filled in sir  is there a two  a guaranteed starting spot  on the indianapolis colts  inside linebacker  we cant accomplish that  i think that andy seems like  he doesnt care so much about the second one  and he would be fine with us just filling in the pit  what do you say scott   eventually were gonna fill it  eventually  ive already been injured in that thing twice  and i can fall in ten more times by eventually  every time i walk past that pit im forced to relive  the most traumatic two separate days of my life and wanna sue you again  well i hate to say it  but it really seems like andy has us over a barrel here scott  this is really happening  i cant believe it  usually in these situations a person says pinch me  is that andy  just one of his conditions for the settlement i guess  he settled  gave up 100000 probably  just for one thing  the city fill in the pit behind your house  why  who knows  who knows why that gopher does what he does  you always hated this pit  goodbye pit  hello lot  how does taking risks make me feel  amazing  tingling sensation throughout my whole body  i feel flushed  my muscles feel relaxed yet i feel awake  just waves of pleasure  i wish there was something physical that can make me feel this way  you did it  you thinking what im thinking   theres so much more to do  were so close  im gonna call kaboom and check on their availability for next year  great  information  hi id like the number for kaboom  the national playground building charity  i hope they can work us in  sorry theres no listing for that name  what are you sure  kaboom is a word i made up its not in any dictionary  i trick people into building playgrounds in empty lots in their neighborhood  its an elaborate prank  for my next prank im gonna build a hospital  in a poor part of china  theyll never see it coming
