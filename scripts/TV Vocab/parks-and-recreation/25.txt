 but just promise me youll be ready because i mean  i dont want to destroy you  i see where were going with this  now when your arms are pinned to your sides  use your legs to break free  instead of your neck which is what andys trying to do  okay hold on  let him go  any of this looking familiar  yeah it happened right over there  im not surprised  take a look at this path  with budget cuts we cant afford a single safety light  theres been ten assaults already this year  really   cant you station a park ranger  we have  who do you think theyre assaulting  im sorry i didnt mean to yell  one way or another im gonna get money so you can protect jerry  and all the other helpless pathetic people in this town  you guys got to slow down   can i just take a rest for a minute  sorry no can do  suns going down its dangerous   lets roll carl  okay going fast  what day is it today   i dont know  okay but to be fair you never know  thats kind of true im super bad at days  but honestly im fine  sorry i squeezed your lights out there son  no worries will you show me how to do that move though  sure i can teach you right now  you shouldtake it easy i think  do you want some more water or maybe some pancakes  no no no im fine   whats the first move in any fight  punch to the balls  weve all heard the old saying  parks are supposed to be fun  but sometimes muggers have their own ideas  leslie knope is with us again  from the parks department  tell us your story  this is my coworker jerry gergich  diabetic  sloppily out of shape  friend  he was mugged this morning  in ramsett park  whos next your frumpy uncle  your simple neighbor  your unpopular coworker  head of security carl lorthner is doing his best  to keep the parks safe but hes failing  so what is the solution to fix this  to make it right  and not bad  we need money from city hall and its not coming through  and pawnee i am sorry to say this  but your government is failing you  up next ten objects you didnt know you can eat  what possessed you to do that  im sorry paul but one of my guys got mugged in the park  i dont care how upset you are  you do not badmouth your own government on tv  im sure youll be happy to know your little stunt worked  the mayors going to divert 2500  to the parks for security upgrades  therell be an announcement tomorrow at 1000 in the press room  so make sure you bring the doofus that got his ass kicked  i dont know who youre referring to we treat everyone with respect  good morning as many of you know  there was an incident involving a government employee  in ramsett park  jerry are you nervous just talk about how hard it was for you  speak from the heart youll be fine  i wasnt mugged   jerry why dont you step on up here  no no i will get up here  im gonna speak for jerry  he cant talk right now because he has hysterical muteness   from trauma  correct  what about this is this fake  this is real i really dislocated my shoulder  were you even in the park yesterday  look i was on my way to feed the hummingbirds  and i stopped for a breakfast burrito  the farting  and lord sheldon he lunged at a bird  i dropped the burrito and it lands on a log in the creek  so i go to reach for it i lose my balance  and i fall on my shoulder really weird  why didnt you just tell everybody the truth  are you kidding me imagine what tom would have said  damn jerry you jumped in a creek for a burrito  what would you do for a klondike bar kill your wife  block the opponents punch and counterpunch to the jaw  shoeshine  ann perkins in the shoe shouse  i wanted to check in i brought some stuff from the hospital  water compress aspirin some lollipops   i know you love those  you know thank you  but im really im feeling great i took a couple of aspirin  and slept right through the night and hold on a second  ludgate what the hell  i got you those muffins that youre always eating  score   tastes like a rug  shut up   good im glad youre feeling better  i am thank you for that  thats so cool  since when did he start doing stuff for other people  now i actually am worried that something happened to his brain  people change i guess  wouldnt you rather the money go to keeping the parks safe  yes but now we have the money under false pretences  i actually think that you have a bigger problem  what  there is someone in your department who is willing to lie  about being mugged because hes afraid of his coworkers  carl what are you doing here  well since you decided to drag my name through the mud on tv  i figured why not return the favor  carl could you quietly quiet down  for a second and please tell me whats going on quietly  in a quiet voice  a citizen handed in a very interesting home video  that i think the people of pawnee will find very interesting  take a peek at this  keep your eyes on the creek  there he is  this is my favorite part  not willing to share with a dog  so it would appear that park security was not to blame after all  okay look i have a proposition for you  fine ill have sex with you in exchange for the tape  thats not what im saying okay  just listen to what i have to say  the ramsett park mugging story continues  with a shiny new twist  ranger carl lorthner is here today  now i understand that you have a bombshell  to drop that you are just sitting on  yes thats correct  i came on today because i have some important information to share  i finally saw avatar  and i thought it lived up to the hype  im not sure what that has to do with the mugging  leslie counterpoint  i disagree with carl  i have seen avatar as well  and i think it exceeded the hype  what  oh boy   we  disagreement  well things are really heating up in here arent they  we should probably take some calls  that segment was a disaster  dont you ever  me like that again this is pawnee  today  do you know that for you i bumped a cat that can stand up on its hinders  you disgust me knope get out of my sight   yes maam  go  dont make me chase you you want to go eat something  i am part of a great team  and sometimes the best way to maintain a strong team  is just by letting someone know that he is still a part of it  this is the only copy  and i am going to destroy it  right after i watch it one more time  im sorry but it is so good   i got you a peppermint latte  seriously   my goodness i love a pepp  i know  jeez  go ahead  we should just directly apply the food to your clothes  making fun of jerrys back  they can laugh at me all they want because two more years until i retire  with full benefits and pension  and my wife and i we have bought a little cottage on a lake  and im gonna make myself a stack of mystery novels  a box of cigars and i could sit back and enjoy my life  april was doublechecked the lunch order you want the salmon or the twout  twout twout twout
