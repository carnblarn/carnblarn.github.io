                 and to my wife i apologize  all i can say is i wasnt just having sex  i was making love to a beautiful woman  and her boyfriend  and a third person whose name i never learned  furthermore it was wrong of me to say  i was building houses for the underprivileged  when i was actually having fourway sex  in a cave in brazil  i bet cave sex is insane   why  the echoes and the humidity   in my defense it was my birthday  and i really wanted to do it  i think its a real shame  when people focus on the tawdry details of a scandal  personally all i care about is councilman dexharts policies  not whether he was high on nitrous and cocaine  during the cave sex  which by the way i heard he was   one more shocking revelation in a story  that just wont stop unfolding  it turns out councilman dexhart may have also had sex  with a prostitute in the limousine  on the way to and from the press conference  where he apologized for having an affair  why does anybody want to run for public office  youre just asking to have your entire life exposed  well if youre squeaky clean like i am theres no problem  youre married and you hit on women constantly  yeah but ive never sealed the deal  just window shopping  you can fly to brazil just dont enter the cave  up top    episode 204 practice date  mpm albator1932 lestat78  you think that youre clean  but i bet that we could find something on you  i changed my name which is legal and once in high school  a girl beat me in a wrestling match thats it  i bet anything i can find worse stuff on all you  are you

accidentally drank an entire bottle of vinegar  i thought it was terrible wine  once i went out with a guy who wore 3d glasses the entire evening  one time i rode in a sidecar on a guys motorcycle  and the sidecar detached and went down a flight of stairs  another time i went to a really boring movie with a guy  and while i was asleep he tried to pull out one of my teeth  i literally woke up
