gosselin lady gaga snooki  are these real people  cash warren and dennis rodman  these are just a few of the celebrities  that wish they could invest in pawnees hottest club  but they caaaaant  and you can for the small price of only  echoing 1000  the only question is whos gonna be my partner  mark im talking to you  donna im talking to you  jerry im talking to you  mark im talking to you  ribbons trophies  medals and miscellany certifying that i am  the kind of person who deserves recognition  for her achievements  what do you have ron  i have the dorothy everytime smurf girl trophy  for excellence in female stuff  dorothy everton smythe i swear to god  leslie  before you continue please read this  another organization giving you credit  for something you didnt do  i ron swanson recognize that  leslie knope should have received the iow award  for all the hard work she has done  especially for the camp athena project  however in my opinion she is far too concerned  with institutional gratification  no im not  so im gonna let her dangle in order to show her  that awards are bull crap  come on leslie you know im not sexist  i love powerful women  well you do attend a shocking number of wnba games  im just saying that awards are political  and everybody has an agenda  you spend your life chasing them  youll drive yourself nuts  yeah all right  but dorothy everton smythe was a trailblazing feminist  she was the first woman in pawnee  to wear pants on a sunday  she spent four years in jail for that  i know im not supposed to care about these things  but this one means a lot   i know youve been changing   the acoustics in the bathroom are insane  so um how much is this one again  uh this one is 425 a month plus utilities  hmm i like it  uh it seems to have  a lot of potential and  a lot of advantages per se  could definitely picture myself  doing something over there  you hear that  what is that  its still on  you can light a match to get rid of that smell  i feel really good about this   really  it screams andy dwyer  and i live nearby so we could like  carpool to work or something   oh are you serious  yep  the scream just got louder  uh so what do you think  i dont know make me an offer  okay first come first served  whos in jerry  oh geez tom  if i spend any more than 25 bucks i gotta ask my wife   jerry get out  okay  imitating ann mark what are we doing tonight  imitating mark oh i dont know ann  we could do the usual boring stuff  like eat some chicken salad with some crackers  or watch the payperview  or  we could go to my nightclub and do some dancin  i dont think so man  youd never have to beg for sex again  i dont wanna get into this really  but i dont beg for sex now  forget about that mark are you in or out  just not really my thing  bye mark  cindy   donna   maybe i like the snakehole  plus i would look good pulling into  my owners parking space in my mercedes  just to be clear you wouldnt be an owner per se  you me and my boy jeanralphio  would each own part of a share  will that be cash or check  not so fast  id like to know who im in business with  i wanna meet your boy  come here this ladys here  hi im elise yarktin im with the iow  imwoman of the year ron swanson  yes i know  we are very excited to be presenting you  with the smythe award  thats what i called you to talk about  i dont know if i can take all the excitement  so i think the award should go to miss knope here  hello  shes the one who really deserves it  camp athena was her idea she did all the work  you made a mistake  uh we didnt make a mistake  we made a very conscious decision this year  to choose a man  why  well uh every year we give it to a woman  and frankly nobody cares  yeah the media has all but written us off  as a niche interest group  but if you give a womans award to  a mustachioed masculine man such as yourself  well then eventually people take notice  i dont want the damn thing  well were giving it to you  so youre gonna take it  like a man  so congratulations  the iow is a bunch of sexist jerks  who need to get back in the kitchen where they belong  and leave the real feminist work to actual feminists  like ron swanson  oh my god what is happening  now do you see how silly these things are  unbelievable  obviously im just gonna decline it  no i want you to accept it  i want you to go to the podium
