ordered a beautiful bouquet of daffodils  from a website after a few glasses of wine  so tom i think you might be getting some daffodils too  donna youre definitely getting some  jerry i dont know im not sure time will tell  also im leaving early tonight  because i am a judge in the miss pawnee beauty pageant  you get to be a judge  yes and its a responsibility i take very seriously  i want to be a judge  i cant believe you like beauty pageants  whoever miss pawnee is  is gonna be the representative of womanhood in our town  and let me assure you that this years  miss pawnee will be chosen for her talent and poise  the girls from talent and poise are gonna be there   what  talent and poise  its a strip club by the va hospital   i have some meetings there  thats disgusting  no whats disgusting is the glitter factory  do not go to the glitter factory  so i was just at the grind and i thought you might want  an iced mocha with extra extra whipped cream  oh my thank you so much april  youre welcome  by the way  completely unrelated  i just signed up for the miss pawnee beauty pageant  thats wonderful  that is why i decided to become a judge  so that awesome girls like you  who are not you know classically hot  can be rewarded for their intelligence and savvy  beauty pageants are idiotic  but i found out that the winner of the miss pawnee pageant  gets 600  i can be idiotic for 600  so are you gonna vote for me sister  april its unethical for me to show you favoritism  you and i are like family   the coffees 7  yes right of course  just bump that clown tell him

pretty amazing  yeah this ones a beauty  in the 1880s there were a few years  that were pretty rough and tumble in pawnee  this depicts kind of a famous fight  between reverend bradley and anna beth stevenson  a widowed mother of seven  the original title of this was a lively fisting  but they had to change it for obvious reasons  shes got him by the hair pretty good there  leslies really cool  and shes smart  its a little intimidating  to tell you the truth i didnt come here to look at the murals  i came to ask her on a date  i really i really like you  and i was wondering  if you maybe want to get a cup of coffee some time  okay yeah sure  yeah absolutely  let me check my schedule  lets see  is that your grandma  its madeleine albright  thats her name  i call mine nana  no thats

time  looks like we got a frontrunner  and now its time for our everpopular talent competition  where our ladies will each demonstrate  their excellent skills  here we have leslies custom score card  with categories such as  presentation  intelligence  knowledge of herstory  fruitful gestures  je ne sais quol  and something called  the naomi wolf factor  and our first one up is trish ianetta  whose talent is baton  my girl trish is talented  shes not even twirling the baton  im going to do impressions  celebrity impressions  thats wild wild stuff  this is an impression of my sister  hi im natalie  i love ritalin and have low selfesteem  this is an impression of my boss leslie knope  women should do everything check out my fourcolor pen  listen up while i talk about some really important stuff  parks parks michelle obama parks  gay penguins parks sugar parks  she got me she got me good  im texting trish to tell her how good she did earlier  no susan isnt a perfect 10  but in my mind susan is the perfect miss pawnee  her values are strong  her commitment to her job is very admirable  she has a real sense of  over here  hows it going  i hooked your toilet up to your shower thats what you wanted right  excellent  is that andy  i know youre in there cause i can see you through the screen  whats up what are you doing  do you live down here  what  oh my god  you live down here  i cant believe this is happening what  i cant be at my house and see my exboyfriend  living in a hole in my backyard like a gopher  thats so weird  i have been trying really hard not to bother you  when you had that barbecue  i didnt come up even though it smelled so good  youve been here a whole week  one week only  i guess thats the office that you were telling me about   that you go to every day  listen  are we gonna talk about anything other than the lies  i cant do this now  ive a guy fixing my bathroom  i got to go  i got to zoom out too cause i have some people coming over  so why dont you call first next time  you know the way out  its time now for the dreaded qa  and the first question goes to tom haverford  i have one for the hot one  first off i just want to say im a little bit surprised  because i didnt think angels could fly so low  you truly are a beautiful  beautiful woman  youre so funny  youre funny  do you have a question  i actually have a real question  if you dont mind  alexis de tocqueville called america the great experiment  what can we do as citizens to improve on that experiment  i think that america  is the land of the free  which is a wonderful thing  and also the brave  where people can live  and no one can ever take that away from you  and it never gives up  but the high birthing rate of immigrants frightens me  no offense to anyone out there  but if it were up to me and my family  i would actually call it our america and not their america  dont applaud that  dont she didnt answer my question  you dont think its weird  that my exboyfriend lives in a tent in the pit outside my house  its not  ideal  maybe you should try to relax maybe  take one of those atavins i saw in the medicine cabinet  dude  i peeked i also didnt see any toothpaste   do you not use toothpaste  i always knew he was lazy  but this is like a new low for him  we should invite him inside  have you not been listening to anything  i dont know its raining outside  and hes living in a pit  folks just a couple more contestants and then the judges will decide  our next miss pawnee  a winner of 600 in gift certificates  to big archies sporting goods and emerson fencing company  what we dont get cash this is for a fence  it wont cover a whole fence but itll defray the cost considerably  oh my god  i quit  i quit  okay i guess she really is quitting  no i didnt win  but at least i didnt make any new friendships  so how long do we have to pretend to deliberate  till we get back out there   what do you mean  were all in agreement   the hot one by a landslide  well her name is trish  and i dont think we should rush this  what is there to talk about i thought trish was just adorable   take susan for example i think  susan boring stories  no its trish lets go back out there  okay hold on everyone  hold on everyone wait wait  look whoever we choose is gonna represent  the ideal woman for a year  shell be someone that little girls in southcentral indiana look up to  now nobody leaves this room until we discuss all of it okay  consider yourselves sequestered  im a judge so i dont want to sound partial  but trish will win this pageant over my dead body  look im the only one here  who has entered and won this contest in the past  and i think trish is a nobrainer  jessica may i ask what was your talent  i packed a suitcase  i have to say leslie does make a good point  trish is not the brightest bulb in the bunch  ray good i like what youre saying lets keep talking  just stand over there and dont drip on anything  is mark the guy whos fixing your shower  i dont know about you mark but ive seen a ton of porn  and i know what fixing your shower means  sorry you are on a date thats cool  no its all right  dont let me interrupt your date   dig in  i already ate im super full  i dont i didnt want any  okay so its still 32 for trish  guys all i ask  is that you look into your hearts  and think really think about what youve seen  and ask yourselves  who is the most impressive woman here tonight  its the hot one trish ianetta  these are amazing do you  do you put a lot of hot sauce on these or something  a good chef never reveals her secrets  its hot sauce  ann is an extraordinary cook  memories  do you want some more are you hungry still  you know whats funny  i was sitting over here on the couch and i was thinking  that there was once a time when mark used to be  the stranger in the house  and now its me  excuse me everyone  why dont we just take a moment to give a round of applause  to all the contestants this evening  especially susan  this isnt the first time that susans have lost to trishes  and it wont be the last  susan and i will continue on  until the women of pawnee are judged not by the flatness of their tummies  but by the contents of their brains  and trish  i may not have voted for you  but now is a time  for us to come together  i hope you honor this crown with dignity  and a devotion to  one two three  as usual ann delicious meal  are we doing anything in the way of dessert or coffee  we are leaving  okay i get it  dont worry im very good at picking up signals   lets go mark  no dummy just you  okay  all right  take care of yourself  just dont worry about  me ann okay  ill be fine  that went really well  we had dinner  i got to see her  oh god i was so tempted to look back at her  was she looking  i had to walk so slow  a good day  well well look whos here  its officer john mcclane  welcome to the party pal   whos that  die hard   battery  hey what
