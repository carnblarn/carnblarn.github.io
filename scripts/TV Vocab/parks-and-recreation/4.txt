big deal  youre a white protestant man with a full rich moustache  but i am a woman and i need to hold myself up to a higher standard  this is ridiculous yore punishing yourself more than anybody else no is gonna punish you  what do you suggest we do you think we should cover this up  no im not saying that no one said coverup  good because the coverup is worse than the crime  when you spill something and you try to wipe it up with something thats dirty then you get double dirty  please dont make this worse oh my god  good afternoon  since we last spoke i have taken extraordinary steps to make further amends for the mistakes that ive made  i have written a full confession  which i will be emailing to everyone in the entire pawnee government  ive also attached a link to the pits web page just to remind people of all the good work that i do  i asked ron to blow the whistle on me and he refused  and that is why i had to whistleblow myself  i wish i could say some of this mess was anns but its all mine  im kind of a nester  eh not bad for a guy with two broken legs  hey  doing a little experiment tonight to see what will get me drunker  drinkingine leslie come here see what

the last year  are they gonna ask that  this is a depositionstyle hearing ms knope nothing is offlimits you have to answer now how many sexual partners have you had in the last year  zero to six zero  have you ever thought about ron sexually  what including dreams  have you ever had a sexual dream about our boss ron swanson no absolutely not no  yes no  now in this recurring dream that you have about ron  is he like a regular ron or is he halfron halfanimal like a ctaur what  is he wearing a football uniform are you making love to him on a couch shaped like his moustache  is he covered in powerade no okay timeout timeout  this committee doesnt take timeouts ms knope now answer the question  i need something to drink how bout some stolen wine  no i meant water  thank you for your ti ms knope youre fired  so thats kinda your worstcase scenario you know if you can handle that i think youll be fine  great  ron thank you for being here with me today  im your department hea i have to be nonetheless  ms knope yes  youre here because you allegedly accepted a gift of over 25 and contributed to the delinquency of a minor  can you tell us what happened  im gonna take a glass of water first if i may certainly  sorry  two days ago i attended an informal boys club meeting for the very first time  after one and a half beers awash in the glow of acceptance into this elite exclusive club   sorry what club is this  a couple city planners like to drink beer in the courtyard on tuesday nights  no one is supposeto drink alcohol on government property  its not my department go ahead leslie  i made a very unwise decision a decision that will live in infamy  i opened a gift basket of wine and cheese  our intern april ludgate drank some of that wine without my knowledge  that was never part of the plan  she had not been invited to the meeting of the boys club i repeat notbeen invited  though it is my hope that someday  she lives in a world where the very idea of boys clubs is ancient history   but you did open the gift basket  and the intern did drink the wine please dont blame her for my mistake  the biggest crime we could commit here would be to destroy a teenage girls passion for local government  theres only one more thing i need to clean me  um i cant really get into a shower so i got this idea from my parents  this is how they clean their dog  you like that  i wrote that for ann  its gonna be playing when she walks through the door today  and check this out  washed my shorts how you like that  hey turn that down no i wrote that song  i dont care turn it down what are you doing in my yard lawrence get outta here  okay you know what im taking it put down my boom box  its my boom box now i asked you nicely you did not ask me nicely  put that down  i just put 12 new batteries in that thing  lawrence come on  ugh ugh give it to me  go back inside hank  ms knope what was the first thing you did when you arrived at work the next day  can you go over the timeline for us once more yes of course  i awoke at 621 a m after a fitful night of sleep weve been over this  what more could you guys possibly want her to do  well we dont know yet frankly weve got a lot more questions  ron its okay no its not  this is not communist china  you cannot make her whip herself you cannot make her wear a hair shirt  we werent planning on doing either of those things this is america  you wanna live in north korea you can live in north korea i dont want to  i want to live in america  leslie has never broken a rule in her life to the point that its annoying  if you want to slap her on the wrist go ahead  you wanna do anything more serious youre gonnaave to go through me  lets go are we done  were done lets go  so after all that its really not that bad youre gonna get a letter in your file  ron i just wanted to say thank you dont worry about it  no i didnt do it for leslie i did it because i hate bureaucracy  my idea of a perfect government is one guy who sits in a small room at a desk  and the only thing hes allowed to decide is who to nuke  the man is chosen based on some kind of iq test and maybe also a physical tournament like a decathlon  and women are brought to him maybe  when he sires them  oh hey ann youre here yeah i came from the hospital  howd it go i dont wanna be overdramatic  but today felt like 100 years in hell and the absolute worst day of my life oh god  i never shoulda opened that stupid basket  yeah why did you open that basket it doesnt really seem like you  i think its cause i wanted to shatter the glass ceiling  you know what i mean and just kind of infiltrate the boys club  i did it for a guy  oh yeah  mark  oh  well i we had a brief affair in february of 2004  and um theres still something very complicated between us so  yeah sure yh  smart woman iffy choice in men  but then again im not one to talk  what do you think andy this is so sweet  nothing what happened to you  oh i was chasing our neighbor who is a total jagweed  and i fell in some prickly bushes  doesnt matter what do you think of the house  hmm were you totally surprised  yeah do you love it yeah  here baby sit down im gonna put something on those scratches  somebody is getting gently laid tonight andy god  you look like you need one of these  come on youre over 21  not supposed to be drinking on government property  loosen up youre gonna drive yourself crazy trying to follow every single rule in government  mark i have a letter in my file  i got seven letters in my file  pretty much every guy in city planning has a bunch of letters  so welcome to the team  look out boys im in your club now  im in your club  and im in your creepy
