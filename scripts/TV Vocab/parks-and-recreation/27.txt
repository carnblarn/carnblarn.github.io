                 can i run something by you  sure i love having things run by me  i feel like youre being sarcastic  no no im not i genuinely love it  run it by me go ahead go go  so ive been worried that ann maybe thinks  that our relationship isnt moving forward fast enough  and so im wondering if maybe i should ask her  if she would like to move in with me  good idea bad idea you tell me  i would say that some women wont consider moving in with someone  unless they think marriage is in the future which i know is  i intend to marry her  for realskies  im not really quite sure how i feel  its a little weird im happy for them theyre my friends  im nauseous  if i could just sum it up in one word it would be    episode 221 94 meetings  mpm  lestat  parks and rec  confirming what  thats not possible  why are there six people outside who say theyre waiting to meet with me  so you know how you love me because you havent had  a single meeting with anyone since i became your assistant  thats because every time someone calls  and requests a meeting with you  i always schedule it for march 31st   why  i didnt think march 31st existed  april march and november  june and november  today is march 31st  i know  so then how many meetings do i have today    you know what to do  right  to me this situation is a bloodsoaked  nightmarish hellscape  however to leslie knope  how fun  why dont you take as many as you can and ill cover the rest  i have an idea  why dont i try to rustle up seven more meetings  cause i think it would be cooler if there were an even 100  why dont we stick to these 93 and see how it goes  this is the perfect distraction  so i have everything i need  i have a fresh cup of coffee comfy furlined boots  ill need them later  yeah no problem theyre actually a
