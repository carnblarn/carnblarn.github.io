                1 good morning ron  good morning  i know how much you enjoy paperwork but dont hover  nice bench is that new  no thats been there since the 90s  what are you doing for your birthday on friday  nothing i never d   aha  oh god  birthday birthday birthday   its your birthday   its your birthday and i know when it is   ron refuses to tell anyone when his birthday is  hes even had it redacted on all government documents  three years of investigations phone calls  freedom of information act requests  and still i had nothing  until a wellplaced bribe to a gentleman at baskinrobbins  revealed  rons birthday is on friday  damn it i was so careful  well you blew it  all for a free scoop of rum raisin  was it worth it ron was it  i command you to do nothing  im not gonna do nothing im gonna do something  and its gonna be really big  i have a lot of years to make up for  i dont like loud noises and people making a fuss  and i especially dont like people celebrating  because they know a piece of private information about me  plus the whole thing is a scam  birthdays were invented by hallmark to sell cards    they put up a fence  who  no   whats that  theres a small park  on the line between pawnee and eagleton and  last night eagleton put up a fence around their side  to keep us disgusting pawnee hobos off their precious land  theres even a security guard  you got to show eagleton id to get in  eagleton is a bunch of rich snobs  and thats coming from someone who has a mercedes  with a harman kardon logic 7 surroundsound system  who builds a fence to keep kids out of a playground  three words lindsay carlisle shay  who  lindsay carlisle shay and i used to be best friends  we worked together at the pawnee parks department  then she went to work in eagleton  and fixed her deviated septum and lost 35 pounds  and lost something else  what was it again  oh yeah her soul  is the eagleton side really that much better   than the pawnee side  to be fair yeah  our side is this scrappy piece of land  where kids go to smash fluorescent light tubes  but it has a lot of heart  thats what people always say when something sucks  we should stand up for our town okay  pawneeans are just as good as eagletonians  although on average we are several inches shorter  and 80 pounds heavier  people in eagleton are straight up mean to us  i would never set foot over there  but its the only place that i can get  my bumble and bumble hair care products  so im there every eight days  okay well i am on operation no more fence  so im putting you in charge of operation rons party   colon shock and awe  i am all over it  i just need you to do whats on that list  leslie has a lot of qualities i find horrifying  but the worst one by far is how thoughtful she can be  its the only park in our neighborhood  i mean where are my kids supposed to play  the rock quarry theres rocks in there  why dont we just set fire to the fence  you know set it ablaze  thats arson  well lets leave that up to the lawyers  the point is it would work  why dont we build a fence around their fence   why  it would give us  two fences  so if they needed to get to their fence  for maintenance and whatnot their pants might get caught  my son joey tried to scale that fence  to play on the eagleton side  and he fell and hurt his arm  you need to get those people to tear that fence down  this womans right  i promise you citizens of pawnee  and sweet brave joey  i will tear down that fence  okay iim just gonna suggest one more time  that we burn it down  but whatever you guys think  yeah great  yes hi  i have a question about your inflatable saxophones  do those come in different sizes  im gonna need about 40 dozen of those  also what about your neon gangster fedora hats  um   that was rude  whatevers going on here  stop it immediately  i was just talking on the phone   to whom  it was personal  i would never make a workrelated call  you know that   lindsay  leslie knope  hi  has it really been five years  it has you look amazing  thank you this place hasnt changed a bit  still loveable but grimy  hello there im ben wyatt  im assistant city manager  hi dan   ben  its not important  it wont come up again  uh this is ann she is my best friend  now  and uh shes a nurse and she works at a hospital   ooh  nice to meet you  oh im sorry its just nursing  you must be so tired its sad  its really nice outside shall we speak in my courtyard  yeah  well thank you so much for stopping by  i was passing through pawnee anyway  i do a lot of charity work here  theres only so much you can do  you know i found a picture of you from back in the day  look me at that  let me get a closer look  so lets talk about lafayette park  oh yes the fence  im only trying to protect our children  come on lindsay this isnt you  when we used to work here together  we loved the fact that parks were for everyone  thats what makes them so great  you know whats really great  a private park thats not for everyone   wowsers  what do you care  its just a crappy little park  well someone once told me  that theres no such thing as small parks   just small ideas  mm  and that someone  was this woman  you can take it if you want  i have many copies and the negatives  and i have a jpeg  the fence stays up   lindsay if we  sweetie  and i mean this in the nicest possible way  pawnee is and always will be a dirty little nightmare  from which you will never wake up  but it was good seeing you  what im not asleep im awake  im wide awake and i got my eyes on you  thats what i wouldve said  if i had thought of it in the moment  what did i say instead  wow this is where they have their public forums   yeah its not that great  they had a valet  yes eagleton is nicer than pawnee  and yes because of their cupcake factory  the air always smells like vanilla  oh yeah   wow  but  their people are not inherently better than our people  the only thing they beat us in  is life expectancy beauty pageants  and average income who cares  factoid alert  eagleton was founded by former pawneeans  pawnee was established in may of 1817  and by july  finding the smell unpleasant and the soil untenable  all the wealthy people evacuated to eagleton  hello pawnee  welcome to our public forum  hi im thomas montgomery haverford   okay  well nice outfit  what did you just come from the stables  yes   i was just at the stables  oh  you look like youve been working hard  you have a million flyaways right now  would you like to borrow a mirror or a selfhelp book  i would not  i would like you to get off your high horse  lindsay pun intended  you know if i had your job there would be no fence there  well you dont have my job  because you knew you couldnt handle it  oh the forum is beginning  uh weve got a little bit of eagleton business   and then ill introduce you  great  look how pretty the people are  hey ron  hows the street parking at your house   what  can you handle like 20 cars  or a doubledecker party bus  there is no street parking at my house  my house is not even on a street  do you have space for like a huge circus tent  hey ron have you seen  what the hell  no  oh  well looks like there wont be any balloons  for the birthday boy  these were for a sick child at the hospital  ah  my office now   i dont work for you  dont care  decisions decisions  uh i think im gonna go  with the porcini mushrooms and boursin sil vous plait  that the eagletonpawnee fence  does a lot more harm than it does good  hello im bertram rolands a citizen of eagleton  with all due respect ms knope  cant you just clean up your side of the park  put some new equipment there  well we would love to do that  but unfortunately money is tight right now  hello im christine porter  i want to respectfully say that im in favor of the fence  i see it as a kind of punishment for pawnee  that might inspire your town to clean up its act  well i would like to respectfully say  that any child should be able to play in any park  regardless of wealth or status  uh anyway this is joey plunkett  joey wave to the audience  oh you cant because you broke your arm  climbing that fence   uh i can wave with this arm  no you cant  both your arms are broken  all due respect i recognize that boy  he was caught selling fireworks to eagleton kids  well with more due respect  a lot of boys do that in our town  you cannot be sure that he is the one  this is a perfect example of how were going to help you  heres to you joey and your mother  and to every pawnee citizen who might have a bright future  if they fundamentally change everything about themselves   thanks to leslie knope  im not done  isnt she trying her hardest  so cute and so good  im only gonna ask you this once  what is going on with my birthday  oh my god ron its your birthday   happy birthday  shut your damn mouth  this is a fun conversation  just tell me what leslie is planning  honestly ii dont know i havent heard anything  why dont you tell me what she did for your last birthday  oh well that was intense  she totally surprised me  she kidnapped me from work  and then she took me to that place senor vegas  you know where the mariachi band comes out  they put a big sombrero on you  and then everybody sings happy birthday  damn it  and then we went back to my house  and she invited basically everyone i knew  and she had this great guy doing face painting  and i had my face painted like a fairy tiger  also she did it like a week before my birthday  which is genius cause i had no idea it was coming  and then there was a bouncy castle  did you know they made those for adults  mmhmm  maybe ill change it up this time  can i try the andouille sausage   tom lets go  what no  hey not you too  its gross i dont like it  its disgusting  did you guys get your public forum gift bag  theres an ipod touch in here  man she used to not be like this  eagleton really changed her  yeah what exactly happened between the two of you anyway  five years ago eagleton offered me that job  and you said no are you insane  i talked it over with lindsay and we made a pact  that we would stay in pawnee together  and work hard and fight to make pawnee  a better place to live  and then they offered her the job  and she took it and disappeared  wow  ooh verbenascented soy candles  you want me to do what now  send leslie somewhere on an assignment  a conference or something  and make her take april and freeze their bank accounts  i dont understand  is leslies work unsatisfactory  no it has nothing to do with her work  i dont want to get into it  ron look this is me okay  you know you can talk to me about anything  well its its my birthday on friday  hey happy birthday  im ending this right now  im just gonna leave early and go home  unless  thats exactly what she wants me to do  all right everybody just grab a bag  and open it up  and then try to find some dirty stuff in there  what are you doing  eagleton treats us like garbage  were gonna treat them like garbage  were gonna take these bags of trash  and were gonna throw it over to their side of the park  and then were just gonna let the stink  and the raccoons run wild  well isnt that  just playing right into what they think of you  oh my god what am i thinking  lets just stop this  put everything back in the truck  lets back it up no no no no  leslie you promised we could throw garbage everywhere  wow  i didnt expect to see the whole parks department here  although it is sadly  one of the nicest spots in town  i am so sick of this lindsay  wait leslie ive got this  you listen to me lindsay carlisle shay  why dont you take your fancy dog  get in your escalade  and if you have any job openings  maybe you should let me know about em   come on man  no  im sick of being treated  like im not willing to relocate to eagleton because i am  so heres what you could do lady  take this resume  and shove it into your human resources slot  oh yeah shove it there  you might have a fancy car and a mahogany purse  or whatever rich people have  but i remember something that youre trying to forget   youre a pawnee girl  mmhmm  no leslie im not  well then why do you come here at dinnertime  and get takeout from the legendary jjs diner  its not for me  these waffles make great dog laxatives  dont you dare  feed that waffle to that dog to get it to poop  sambuca need to make  there you go   leslie  how dare you   get her  get her leslie   get off of me  get her  garbage fight  i want her arrested for attempted murder  for gods sake knope get a grip  thank god youre here  i want her arrested  she attacked me  and then she hurled my kate spade headband somewhere  i think my eagleton colleagues would agree  that we dont want to make a federal case out of this  so i suggest you both apologize to each other  and we pretend this never happened  i will never apologize to her   nor i her  nor i her  i doth proclaim to be a stupid fartface  nice retort did gb shaw write that for you  did gb shaw write your stupid fartface  ladies if you dont apologize  were gonna have to toss the both of you in jail  so just swallow your pride  say youre sorry  we hope you enjoy your evening here  at the eagleton holding cell  can i offer you anything herbal tea greek yogurt  no  morning ron  ooh dude you forgot to put a shirt on  i do it all the time its fine   i slept here  sweet  so a little birdie told me its your birthday coming up  how about a free birthday shoe shine  what did this little birdie tell you  is going to happen for my birthday  oh nice try ron youre not getting anything out of me  andrew please  ron look i love you like a father  whos not that much older than me  like a young uncle  or like uh you were my camp counselor  but were adults so we hang out  and its not weird you know  or actually heres what it is  youre my lacrosse coach i get it i get it  whats the point  well coach  leslie swore me to secrecy so i cant say anything  i owe her so much i cant ruin it for her   well i respect that  mmhmm   see you later  okay  not if i see you first uncle ron  and i probably will  cause leslie assigned me to the kidnap squad  hey jailbird  beautiful ann thank you for coming to get me  oh my god are you kidding  are you okay  it was a rough night but i survived  scone   they only have maple walnut  yeah thank you  why did you get arrested what did you do  the only thing im guilty of is loving pawnee  and punching lindsay in the face  and shoving a coffee filter down her pants  but in my defense i believe that assault should be legal  if a person is a jerk  why are you letting her get to you like this  because shes a stupid jerk  because we were best friends  and then she sold out everything that we believed in  and the worst part  to her our friendship  its like it never happened  well first of all this color looks amazing on you  thank you  second of all the whole fence thing  shes obviously trying to get a rise out of you  third of all she knows she only got the job  because you turned it down which must drive her nuts  but most importantly you say the word  and i will beat her senseless with a baseball bat  thank you  wait a minute  oh my god okay we have a lot of work to do  ann put these scones in your bra   lets go  okay  can we just stop off at the um lobby  cause the prison gift bags are amazing  hey batter batter batter batter batter  hey batter batter batter batter batter batter batter  hey batter bah  lucas with a crazy base hit  dude stop rooting for the other team  youre just mad cause they are lighting you up   whats going on here  hi lindsay  introducing the pawnee wiffle ball league  its an idea that i came up with  after my best friend ann over there  said she wanted to bash your head in with a baseball bat  and i want to thank you for the fence  theres no way we could afford that highquality wood  what if someone hits a home run  how will you get the ball back  one of the many eagleton kids who signed up  will just pop over and grab it  hey what are you doing tonight   why  i dont know  i thought maybe you could bust out your old jazz sweatshirt  and you and i could go to sullivans for a beer  yeah i do still have that sweatshirt  i know you do  foul ball   you did all this in a day  yeah  all right  i work with some really great people  good job guys great job  hey did you hear the news  ben and chris want us to go into conference room c  for a meeting  lets get this over with  happy birthday ron  ann said you had a big party  sombreros karaoke  yeah i did that for ann  why would i throw ron swanson an ann perkins party  what about the giant list of things april was doing  that was just a list of ways to mess with you   she do em all  she did indeed  so i have rented bridge on the river kwai  and the dirty dozen  artie from security is outside the door  so no one will bother you  and a cab will be here whenever youre ready  to take you home  thank you  do you remember what you said to me five years ago  when eagleton offered me that job  and i asked you for your advice  uh do whatever the hell you want  what do i care  right but then after  when i pressed you what did you say  i believe i said  that i thought we worked well together  and that i might disagree with your philosophy  but i respected you  and i said that youll get  a lot of job offers in your life  but you only have one hometown  yes  thats how i remember it  this by the way is a onetimeonly situation  next year your birthday party is gonna be a rager  mmm    mmm
