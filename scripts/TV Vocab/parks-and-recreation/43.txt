good night  well now im up you wanna boggle   are you ron swanson  i am  okay what exactly did you teach my daughter  oh you must be mrs berkus  lauren was supposed to do a paper  on why government matters  this is what she wrote  it doesnt  well said   is this a joke  no maam  i legitimately believe that im a libertarian  oh thats nice well she is a fourth grader  and fourth graders arent supposed to have  their heads crammed full of weird ideas  theyre supposed to do cute reports  and get gold stars  im very sorry i was only  and you ate her lunch and you gave her a land mine  really  well it seemed appropriate at the time i  how  you know this is my house right   yeah hi  do you wanna come in   you okay  no  andy is totally mad at me right now  and i dont know how to deal with him  so i thought i would ask you  you know andy and i broke up so long ago  i i dont think that id be the best source to  please  what happened  he doesnt think i like mouse rat  and all i said to him was that this other band was better  but i dont know why he got all mad  because its like an indisputable fact  that theyre better theyre a real band  oh boy okay  well andy just wants you to be proud of him and his music  so this isnt really about being right  its more about being supportive  oh wow  i didnt realize you were a marriage counselor ann  sorry  my instinct is to be mean to you  i understand  omg  leslie i read that same article  the history of the ladder  its utterly fascinating   ben youre gonna love this  really  do you know that the original image of a ladder  is in a cave in valencia spain  drawn over 10000 years ago  oh my god how about some music  thats amazing what is this  oh man i love this song  the pit i was in the pit   wait a minute  you were in the pit   we all were in the pit   the pit   i was in the pit   you were in the pit   we all were in the pit    what is this  living out my dream  playing a show with the greatest band ever  thats my guitar  you bought it back from sewage joe  i actually stole it from his office  but whatever  hes a weirdo  maybe april doesnt think that were the greatest band  in the world but man she loves me  and i love her  so you know who cares  i got the greatest wife in the world   stop  were married  were totally gonna do it later  oh my god  well actually i think its good that chris showed up  cause i wasnt thinking clearly  i love my job ben loves his job  and its just not worth the risk   oh hey  hey  chris just wanted me to drop off these receipts  oh well hes not here he took off  okay  uhoh  all im saying is keep an open mind for a while  listen to your teachers and read all the books you can  then when youre eighteen you can drink gamble and become a libertarian  the drinking age is 21  i know another stupid government rule   so you write a new paper  yeah   can you autograph this one for me  sure
