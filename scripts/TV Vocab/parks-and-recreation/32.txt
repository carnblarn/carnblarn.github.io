more than   now have you seen any of the twilight movies  no i have not  well let me describe them to you shotforshot  movie number one twilight  we slowly pan up over a mossy log  to see a deer drinking crystalclear water  okay kelly this time capsule  isnt just a barrel full of stuff that people like  its about life in pawnee at this moment in time  and there is nothing in twilight  that is specific to pawnee  i disagree okay  the town of forks washington is exactly like pawnee  except for the climate and the vampires  im sorry i have to say no  i beg you to reconsider  and im gonna have to ask you to leave  then im gonna have to do this  he brought handcuffs with him  this whole thing was planned  i think its kind of cool  its not cool  its trespassing and that is breaking the rules  cool people make the rules they dont break the rules  and if those kids want you to break the rules  then they arent really your friends  whoa who are you even talking about  i dont know im sorry im just annoyed  but while were on the subject  your friend orrin with the long black nails and the cloak  he concerns me  hes a genius  ill care of this trespasser  give me 30 seconds  im just gonna call security  guys can we push the meeting an hour  whats going on  some guy handcuffed himself to a pipe in my office  because we wouldnt put a copy of twilight  in the time capsule  damn it again  you look sad  you look like a weird goon  whos obsessed with a kids book  its a girl isnt it  i can tell  its the look that mike had on his face  when bella turned him down for the dance  oh yeah is it  what look did your mom have on her face  when she realized her son was a complete failure  okay ill be quiet  but i do know something about heartbreak  and you know who else does   kenneth babyface edmonds  no  a little lady named twilight author stephenie meyer  trust me  you should listen to him  those books are good  oh i love any book about vampires  werewolves monsters zombies  sorcerers beasties or timetraveling romances  and if i had an hour alone with robert pattinson  he would forget all about skinnylegs mcgee  ill tell you that much  okay buddy time is up  give us the keys  theyre hidden somewhere very far away  then were gonna have to cut you loose  why im not doing anything wrong  yes you are youre trespassing  well the fact remains this is perfectly legal  no its not youre trespassing  look i really dont want to cause any trouble  but i am not gonna leave until you  put twilight in the time capsule  this muscleheaded storm trooper  doesnt scare me  go ahead artie  no no no no no  please no no no no no no get him away from me  i am very scared of you  all right  okay all right all right all right  stop  if he wants to stay in there  ill let him stay in there  in two hours hes gonna be so hungry  and freaked out hes gonna be begging me to  he brought a pillow  hey leslie im making some sleepytime tea  you want any  hey dude wake up man  oh morning tom  twilight is dope   i told you  i couldnt put it down  it was like she was peering into my soul  sing it friend here  book two twilight new moon  get cracking  theres a second book  and a third and a fourth  no bleep way   its fantastic  yeah  i worked really hard i did every pair that i could  i didnt know what to do with these   i think theyre gloves  no no no no  those are sports sandals  theyre for adventure racing  they perfectly contour to the human foot  and the human foot is the ultimate technology  dude that is the coolest sentence  ive ever heard somebody talk  so you love april  and she has a new boyfriend right  you got all of that from a picture  no you told me yesterday andy  i want to help you win her over  why do i want to help him  because hes a good person  i love good people  hey you know who should wear these shoes  monkeys  well this is an interesting turn of events  is it ii dont know  i mean i guess its kind of interesting  what the real story is  is how wonderful our time capsule is  and how it perfectly encapsulates  a word i really think you should use  what our town is all about  hey hows this for a headline  parks department foiled by pipe dreams  god thats an amazing headline  but please dont write that story  the key to aprils heart is within you andy  you need to tap in to the aspects  of your personality that she once found attractive  to make yourself the best version of yourself  whats great about you  im nice  good nice  what else  im in a band  band   what else  thats it  am i team edward yes  do i share his concerns about turning bella though  absolutely not  edwards primary goal at all times  is bellas protection  can you please please be quiet  sorry sorry  please keep it down be considerate  look at it this way tom  bellas love for edward is being tested  by jacob  mm not exactly   the volturi  yes  okay you know what all right  im gonna go do my work in the conference room  cause you guys are the worst  you seem tense leslie you know what you should do  read twilight  read twilight here  yeah thanks  sometimes i think shes in the volturi  good morning kelly  oh morning leslie  hope you dont mind i moved myself over to this pipe  its a little more comfortable  no problem  did you have a nice night sleep well  mm it was all right considering  picked you up some coffee  thank you so much  well you seem pretty chipper this morning  i am kelly  because i know why youre here  you know what i did last night  read twilight and it transformed your life  and youre gonna put it in the time capsule  well i read the first ten pages  i couldnt really get into it though  more of a harry potter girl myself  what  but i looked at the inside cover  and i saw this  did a little research and liz waverly  is 12 years old a straight a student  at king philip middle  shes also a member of many  twilight internet message boards  and im guessing your daughter  is that why you did this  to impress your daughter  lizs mom and i divorced a couple years ago  and its been really hard on her  and she loves twilight and so  i read about your time capsule and i thought  that if i could somehow convince you  to get it in there id be a big hero  thats really sweet  you should have told me you were doing this for your daughter  i didnt want to drag her into it  im sorry this is a mistake  you dont have to put twilight in the time capsule  i think we should put twilight in the time capsule  leslie no  we dont negotiate with weirdos  yeah what happened to a perfect encapsulation  of life in pawnee  well for that guy life in pawnee  is him and his daughter reading that book  besides i can get shauna on board  it would make a great human interest story  uh if this gets out  every time you want to do anything  some guys gonna come into your office  and handcuff himself to a pipe  well yeah thats a good point  then we shall bring the pipe to them  oh no  oh yes  what does that mean  crackpot convention  so thats what todays forum is for  were gonna hear suggestions from everyone  and then whichever items we generally agree on  will go into the time capsule  please remember this is a government project  so we need to refrain from corporate promotion  and religious items  whod like to start  i think we should put in the bible  great  eduardo  hi eduardo  i want to apologize  just because youre dating my soul mate  doesnt give me any right to be a jerk to you  um i promise from now on  im just gonna be super nice to you  thank you for saying that  youre welcome  um what uh cds are those  mouse rat my band  its our latest album yeah  you uh like music what are you listening to  the smiths ugh very depressing  aprils making you listen to that  shes really into that indie stuff  im more of a dave matthews guy myself  david matthews crash into me  yes i love that song  here you go here take one check us out  were amazing so let me know how much you like us  yeah gracias  that means thank you   yes  nailed it  so we have one very moving case for twilight  anyone else great   two people for twilight  oh no no no no  im marcia langman from the society  for family stability foundation  this book contains pagan creatures  and strong sexual overtones  there are girls quivering  there are boys staring deeply into girls eyes  as they quiver and so forth  there really is a tremendous amount of quivering  it is antichristian  it is proquivering and the government  has no business promoting it  i totally disagree  well now we have two people for twilight  absolutely not  im with the national civil liberties association  that book actually contains overt christian themes  and as such has no business being associated  with any government project  so too christian and not christian enough  do you see the irony here  no okay  uh donna why dont you put a question mark  next twilight  no you promised  you promised thats not fair  wait its not a question of fairness   its secul  go back to russia commie  hey you go back to russia  and you go back to wherever you came from  why would i go to russia  i have no interest in traveling to russia  can i just say that  um who else  i would like to include my favorite book  crazy from the heat the david lee roth story  well i think if were gonna be adding a book  to the time capsule it would probably be twilight  i dont care about twilight  why is this only about his favorite book  i want my favorite book in there  okay i have an idea  two time capsules  one that totally encapsulates whats happening  right now in pawnee in this moment in time  and the other one thats just for items  of personal significance like twilight  no twilight  yes twilight   hey  hey  thanks for coming  i only have a second i have to get to work  bellas going on her first hunt  i just dont get why you broke up with me  is it cause im not cool enough  like the normal kids compared to the vampires  is it an edwardbellajacob type situation  where you like me but theres someone else you like more  uh its nothing to do with twilight  it just didnt work out okay  well what difference does it make  if we stayed together you probably would have  just dumped me for ron  actually thats the reason  i believe you when you say that youre not in love  with wendy anymore but youre definitely not cool  with her dating ron  you talk about it constantly  well i cant help it okay  i mean hes so manly and hes my boss  imagine if your boss was angelina jolie  and then one day she just started  dating your exboyfriend  wouldnt that freak you out a little bit  well not if i had great new boyfriend dumbass  look tom i like you  youre really cute and youre funny  and youre small enough for me to throw you around  so if you ever work through this  then give me a call  my grandmother lived in pawnee for 60 years  and i want to put her ashes in the time capsule  my cat turnip was the greatest cat ever  and id like to put his ashes in the time capsule  for the last time and i wont say this again  there will be no human or feline ashes  in either one of the time capsules  except for turnip  except for turnip  no chanting  look we dont know what the world  is going to be like in 50 years  we could all have been wiped out from disease or the flu  so whats your suggestion  i dont know  im just scared  hey  andy  i got two microphones a fourtrack recorder  and every bass tab to dave matthews ever   vamos  were gonna jam  for like nine hours is that cool   yeah  all right  thats ridiculous  now why should the bill of rights  be in the official time capsule  but this painting of my dog  is in time capsule seven  well i think pet paintingsashes  are in time capsule four  no thats baseball cards  no baseball cards  are in time capsule nine childhood memorabilia  honestly twilight could go  in almost any of these categories  oh shut up kelly  make me bob  okay lets take a tenminute break  oh god  this time capsules tearing this town apart  youre leaving soon  can i blame it on you in the press  sure  well i got to say i think its kind of impressive  ive been to a lot of towns  usually people dont care about anything  i mean dont get me wrong  these people are weirdos  but theyre weirdos who care  excuse me everyone  i realize things have gotten a little out of control  and thats bens fault and hes sorry  but i have an idea and if you like it  i think we can end this right now  dear pawnee of the future  congratulations  you have found a time capsule  that was buried over 50 years ago  we wanted to include a collection of items  that would best represent  what life was like in our town at that moment  instead youll find only one item  a video recording of a public forum we held  in order to determine just what those items would be  this is truly what life was like  a lot of people with a lot of opinions  arguing passionately for what they believed in  so enjoy watching it  aassuming you still have electricity  and sorry about the weird blank gap in the middle  a man named jerry gergich  screwed up the recording somehow  he had one job to do  sincerely pawnee of the past   is eduardo coming  no he went back to venezuela  oh that sucks  he was a really good bassist   i was actually started to like him  i know  thats what made me start to hate him  the nice and band totally worked  have you enjoyed your time with andy  yeah hes great  and he told me how great you are  and he told me that i would be crazy to let you away   he did huh  he did  and also theres a pretzel stand over there that literally serves  the best pretzel ive ever had would you like one  absolutely  hey guys  listen ive never seen this before so  id really appreciated if no one like talked or texted or anything  oh  hey   hey leslie thanks for setting this up  dude what did i just say   i was the guy who introduced you to  how about you shut up
