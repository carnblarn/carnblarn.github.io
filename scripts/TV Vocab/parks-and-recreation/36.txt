                1 okay everybody the harvest festival is tomorrow  and i am so proud of all of you youve worked so hard  youre amazing so i have a surprise  and it is possibly  the best thing to potentially ever happen  to anyone anywhere  in the history of the universe  ladies and gentlemen  the world famous little sebastian   what  yes  no way  little sebastian oh my god  i never thought id get to meet him   its really him  well done leslie  well done  little sebastian made his debut  at the last harvest festival in 1987  and he was an instant phenomenon  for the next few years  sebastian was the number one boys name in pawnee  and the number three girls name  so what am i missing whats the deal with the pony  hes not a pony man hes a mini horse  theres a big difference  well then why is he so famous  does he do something what does he do  son this horse  has an honorary degree from notre dame  we all need to be very careful okay  remember this little guy is 25 now  and he has cataracts in both eyes  and he has severe arthritis  jerry is going to look after him  yes i am  we are both on the same diabetes medication  are you my glucotrol buddy  are you huh  isnt it amazing  yeah i just gotta be honest  i dont know what the big deal is  get out  triumphant music   hmm  okay couldnt you put sues salads here  on deep fried boulevard  its just  theres so many junk food places and only one salad stand  well theres a lot of people that dont consider salad a food  the harvest festival is the biggest thing  ive ever done in my career  and if it fails the parks department will be eliminated  thats why were going big  seven days over 30 different locations  and four hospitality kiosks  god i gotta stop ending on that boring thing  clowns  man you are just knocking these off  youre like a ninja crossed with a jedi or something  youre like a nerd mixed with a dork or something  tom star wars is not that nerdy  nerdy voice no star wars is not that nerdy

wamapoke  ah wahallo  have a seat ken i know why youre here  and just let me say that we really tried  im sorry leslie but this is a big one  im under a lot of pressure  im gonna need to formally ask you to move the carnival  im sorry whats going on  the carnival is on the site of the battle of indian hill  which was an epic seven day battle that the wamapoke lost  due to the fact that they didnt have any weapons  during the battle  was shot 102 times by the calvary  did he die  softly yes  and this moment will be commemorated  for the next seven days  with shooting galleries and fried dough stands  ken i understand  but its the only place in town  thats big enough to house the carnival rides  plus you know with pawnees history  its very difficult to not be offensive  this is a map of all the atrocities the pawnee settlers  inflicted upon the wamapoke indians  the atrocities are in blue  we put up a memorial plaque  and we have a wamapoke exhibit in the history tent  i completely understand you  but this is sacred burial ground  and i just hope that the souls of my ancestors  dont put a curse on this festival  there are two things i know about white people  they love matchbox 20  and they are terrified of curses   hey  hey  um so somebody i dont want to say who  it was totally me  got sweetums to donate another   ah take that curse  take that curse  both shooting sounds

get him a tail scrunchie  most people look at lil sebastian  and they see a famous mini horse  i see an advertising opportunity for my club  the snakehole lounge  wow that is a shockingly huge mini horse erection  horse neighing  what about your friend ben here  we all know his story one of failure  remind us of that failure  well uh you know when i was an 18yearold mayor  i tried to build a winter sports complex  called ice town and it bankrupted the city  yikes  i was also shortstop on my jv baseball team  no one ever brings that up  and now youre involved with this  do i smell another disaster hopefully  look joan this festival  thanks to the tireless efforts of leslie knope  is going to bring people nothing but happiness  not even i could screw that up  im a reporter not your therapist  so any time someone takes a picture of him  the snakeholes logo is in it  am i a genius or what  hey tom wheres lil sebastian  uh somebody left the gate open and he got out jerry  what are you talking about  unbelievable  another in a long string of miserable failures  you lost lil sebastian   i wasnt even here  exactly  you look for him im gonna go tell everyone what you did  harvest starts at 9 am tomorrow morning  and as far as this reporter is concerned  its well worth your time  come on down everyone its gonna be sweet  it pains me to say this but great job here  thank you   that went well  yeah it did   take that curse  take that curse  sorry what is this about a curse   hmm  curse  what what nothing   no no  leslie  its lil sebastian hes gone  jerry let him escape and we dont know where he is  keep those cameras up weve got a new intro to do  gotcha  lets go ahead lets get some shots  of chipped paint and crying babies  how about some of those spooky traffic lights  okay you know the drill  okay this is bad right  this is way worse than that  this is a huge government project  and already a lightning rod  and then you add the wamapoke controversy  double lightning rod   plus we lost that little pony  its a mini horse  and thats the third lightning rod  triple lightning rod  and then you have the curse quadruple lightning rod  god now all the vendors are gonna bail  and the ticket sales are gonna go down  wait im sorry  but do people in this town really believe in curses  oh no no  we all just behave rationally and believe  we are all in charge of our own destinies  come on  what the heck are we gonna do  how did this happen  maybe lil sebastian got upset  because he tried to share his true feelings  with someone and they didnt reciprocate  thats not bad  or maybe a balloon popped somewhere  and it scared him  sent him running off  okay  tom jerry check the field behind the parking lot  andy april check the corn maze  good idea horses love mazes come on  hey leslie  this big beefy dude just came in to the first aid tent  because he was dehydrated  and then a reporter came in  and asked if it was because of the curse  gasps no comment did you say no comment   you gotta say no comment  i did  ah good anne youre so beautiful  beautiful anne  all right well um  just treat him and release him  and then dont say anything to anyone  about anything for the rest of the month   okay  okay run anne run   okay  leslie   yeah  you gotta see this  the fact is this carnival is  being held on top of an ancient wamapoke burial site  much like the house in the movie poltergeist  exactly  i spoke to leslie knope of the parks department  about moving the carnival  and she refused  we do have exclusive animation of that event  lets take a look  oh i love these things sorry  speaking virtual language  speaking virtual language  chanting  moaning  whoa  ahahah  is that what happened   perd  none of that happened  that is exactly what happened  all right all right  what we do is we move the shooting gallery  that seems to be their biggest problem  maybe that will make them happy  check back in with news channel 4  number one in curse coverage  you know how indians call corn maize  this is why i never knew that  oh my god im gonna go look by myself  hey are you all right  you seem super not happy  im fine  oh i forgot to

top of the ferris wheel  were extremely confident that theres no curse  and everyones gonna have a great time tomorrow  okay  wow first ice town now this  bad luck really follows you around huh  okay id like to start by addressing  some of the false rumors about the festival  first of all we have plenty of food  theres no food shortage  there are not as one reporter suggested  dozens of escaped convicts meandering around the carnival  and at no time was any parks department quote  feasting on petting zoo animals  you were in charge of  watching a tiny horse and you failed  look im only gonna say this once  what if lil sebastian is on this ferris wheel  how about you only say that never  leslie how big of a disaster  will this be on a scale of 9 to 10  it will not be a disaster  it will be a success  and i want to let everyone know that  in an attempt to be sensitive to our wamapoke friends  we have moved the shooting gallery per their request  so yes perd  yeah the statement that this reporter has is a question  will that be enough to lift the curse  perd you know as well as i do that there no such  oh my god  crap on a spatula  its the curse  thats exactly what it is  you know what it is the curse  wait everyone relax please  well get this up and running in no time   oh  whoa   jerry what the hell  i didnt do this  jerrys fault jerrys fault  all jerrys fault jerrys fault

you on my knees  begging for help  much like the early settlers of pawnee  begged the wamapoke   ah but that was  a trick  and over 50 wamapoke were slaughtered  i know  but this is not a trick  i am prepared to put the wamapoke history exhibit  inside the carnival grounds  right past the entrance turnstile  so that you have to look at it before you start having fun  hm now thats interesting  its
