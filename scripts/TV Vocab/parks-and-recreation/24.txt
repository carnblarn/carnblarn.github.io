on the bell tower  and poopy the raccoon who poops all over the high school cafeteria  shouldnt you take this up with animal control  lets be honest  its not the most effective branch of our government  a bunch of burnedout morons  you have the reputation as a person who gets things done  so wed like you to form a little task force  find the animal and put it down   task force  needless to say  the mayor will be very grateful for your help  maam the next time we speak  we shall be dancing on the grave of a possum  great  ron will show you around  right this way is the exit  yo police

sure enough maybe  if it wasnt fairway frank would i feel badly of course   could i live with myself  that depends  as a city official its important that i ask myself a lot of questions  does doing so help me make decisions   hey shauna  hi leslie  andy you remember shauna malwaetweep from the pawnee journal  how could i forget you wrote the article when i fell  and then afterwards had sex with mark  and everyone talked about it  so youre on the golf course and you see fairway frank  well we see a possum that we believe to be fairway frank  so for right now lets just refer to it as a possum  let me explain something tweep when youre in a situation  you dont have time to think  so i thought to myself  dont think andy act  so you werent thinking  not at all  i cannot emphasize enough how little i was thinking  were you scared  no no i wasnt  well i lived in the pit for the better part of last year  and made some vermin friends  you know what friends sounds stupid  colleagues  they are bad at sharing  but they are good at tag  well your family must be very proud  what does your girlfriend think the nurse  i broke up with ann  shortly after she kicked me out and told we wouldnt be together anymore  maybe this article will change her mind  what now  i hadnt even thought of that  of all the things i thought would bring us back together  catching a possum was never on that list  lets go take some pictures of fairway frank  of the possum  seriously man when you wear these clothes  you just feel better than everyone else you know  busy   no whats up  just wanted to tell you  i understand that city codes exist and i know why they exist  and i understand that you enforce them  okay good talk can you sign off on my plans now  did you get everything up to code   yup  no you didnt   you clearly didnt  its my property  my land  my shop  tummy needs a banana you guys good  ron youre asking me to do a bad job  at my job and im just not gonna do that  so if you dont mind would you please get out of my office  silly me there was this little pompom on my glove  and it fell off youve seen it  could you help me look for it it should be on the ground somewhere  where i was puttin it up lets see   so hows your hole  excuse me  the pit lot 48  were making progress on the park  in fact there may be some big news on that front coming soon  all because of this very important business card  so this isnt really a big story right nobody cares about this very much  fairway frank did bite the mayors dog so this could be on the front page  fairway frank youre gonna die  youre gonna fry  you guilty son of a bitch  youre gonna fry when they flip that switch  can i talk to you about the possum  hypothetically if you were going on a mission to say  catch a guilty whale  and while you were catching the whale you saw something else  that may also be another whale you were like what you thought   maybe its not a whale but a big fish a submarine with a face painted on it  the point is if i kill the first whale am i technically a murderer   what youre talking about  i saw a second possum  there was another possum  andys in there talking to a reporter literally kissing his own biceps  youre telling me he might not be a hero  but just some jerk that goes around tackling random possums  ive gotta help leslie find the truth not because im pissed at andy  which im not  because i care so deeply about possums  cause theyre so adorable  april did you see my photo shoot  i nailed it  i fell off the stool when i was trying to look serious but im okay  thats cool im really happy for you  you are  our happy reactions are super different  so he said hes gonna email me the photos in like six hours   you wanna wait with me  that sounds good  but i cant because i have to go do something that actually matters  fairway franks been haunting  the 6th hole for a while you must know him well  i sure do  ive chased that little sucker off more times than i can count  can you just take a look at these photos  and make sure that its fairway frank  thats him  mr campopiano those are photos of three different possums  you want something to drink  boss theres a possum  wandering around on the 14th green should i call animal control again  my god  theyre here from animal control theyre gonna take it away  we need a little bit more time to figure out the truth i have an idea  im gonna distract everybody then you get that possum out of here  can you do that april  get the possum out of here sneak it out  can you do it tell me you can do this  yes i can do it god  i cant kill the possum because it might be innocent  i cant let the possum go because it might be guilty  cant make a good soup cant do a handstand in a pool  cant spell the word lieutenant  theres a lot of cants in my life right now  lets make it happen captain  help my arm is bleeding  holy cow leslie  look how much its bleeding look at it  everybody look over here   i need everyones full attention  theres a lot of blood  it is so   its ketchup  is it  its ketchup  do you know them  what do you mean  that fairway frank is not here  heres the thing evelyn  were not sure that the possum we caught is in fact fairway frank  whoever it is its a possum  and the sooner its dead  the sooner the mayor can do what he wants with it  does he want to have sex with a dead possum  hes not a monster he wants  to stuff it and hang it above the urinal in his office bathroom  so that little flecks of pee can get on it forever  you did a great job  and the mayor knows that you did a great job  now where is the possum  im sorry but hes somewhere youll never find it  and hes gonna stay there until the truth comes out  and i will not reveal his location no matter how much you ask me  im gonna stop talking now im afraid to say where it is so please go  interesting  they put down a raccoon  that bit a jogger in a park in staten island  and in walnut creek california they put down a duck  that bit a kid  but security footage later revealed  that it was actually a goose  great  no its awful tom how would you feel if you killed an innocent duck  and let a vicious goose waddle free   tom haverford  tom its april  im at anns house and the possums loose  i need your help its chewing on everything   dont tell leslie  you got it  possum got loose at anns house  my god  april its leslie knope from the parks department  stop ringing the doorbell its making him mad  my god how did this happen  i let it out of its cage because it needed water  and i thought it would drink out of the toilet but it ran off  and i couldnt get it back in  he did that too  then i opened all the doors i thought it would go outside  but it wont leave the house it must love tacky pictures of flowers  im gonna fix this  let me just think for a second   what  where is it i cant see it  where did it go heres what we do  we just go outside lets go outside  get in here   i havent even started yet  i know  you could use some help  those city planning guys can be real pains in the ass  i just want you to know that i still dont think city codes  ron shut up would you please  im taking a half day off  to come and help you out because youre my friend  so just  shut up  im bringing my workshop up  to the swanson code  and if the swanson code happens to overlap  with the city government code  shut up  i know theres a door there but i kind of feel like  its gonna chew through the door and jump on my face and bite me   what if its in here  what if it laid eggs in the bed  there are no eggs  we should have killed it its so huge  im gonna call andy  he tackled it once before he can do it again  no please dont okay hes gonna be pissed at me  i already ruined his big day  its my fault that its in anns house who hes still in love with  i just  i dont  want him to be mad at me okay  hell forgive you  you think  we dont call andy  we can just call animal control  anytime you want to talk about boys  my god stop  so you were mad at me yesterday and i dont know why  so i made a list of everything i did  and ill try not to do any of them again  also  i got you this coffee  and then theres this fourth paragraph down  but dwyer had some help catching the possum  i couldnt do it without an early morning caffeine boost  from the amazing april ludgate  she gave me the liquid courage to wrestle that beast to the ground  i have to say im very disappointed  you didnt have to say that youd have just thought it  whatd you do with the possum  im proud to say  that its somewhere the mayor can never pee on it  its okay  i mean look  when i retire  and im attending some gala  honoring the first three female presidents in history  myself and two other women ive inspired  i wanna be looking back  at my distinguished legacy  and not thinking that i owe my career to some possum  and i wanna be wearing a huge beautiful blue hat   thank you so much  sure  it made me feel so happy that i knew you were here taking care of my house  cool  did the neighbors give you any problems   anything in  possum there was a possum  we captured a possum we brought it here   it might have laid eggs in your bed  what  it went into your laundry your kitchen and it touched all your bras  and im so sorry its our fault  we captured it it got out ran around and it was a possum  run april sorry ann i love you   im gonna go  i think that would be best
