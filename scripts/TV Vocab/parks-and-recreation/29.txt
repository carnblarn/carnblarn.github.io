good friend for throwing the party  im also a genius because im using the occasion  to stock the club with every available hottie i know  call me a romantic  but i believe by the end of the night  i

am 21 years old today  which is the age that pretty much everyone agrees  makes you an adult    the yearly budget and planning proposal for a city  is called the master plan  isnt that just so awesome you cant stand it  oh i shall now reveal to you my master plan  mwahhahaha  eeahahahah  kind of sounded like a chimp there at the end  good morning everybody  i know you all have your budget presentations ready  but theres a change of plans  due to the crippling gridlock in city counsel  we are postponing  all planning and spending decisions indefinitely  um until when  indefinitely   and when will that end  later than now  so this week probably   look we are bordering on a fullblown crisis leslie  the state government is sending a team  from indianapolis to try to solve  this budget problem  just calm down  you dont even know what theyre gonna do  ron theyre state auditors  theyre here to slash and burn  we gotta fight these guys  theyve been sent by the governor  they outrank everyone  theres no fight to be had here  yeah youre right im not gonna fight them  except that i am  okay  leslie  what do we do when we get this angry  we count backwards from 1000 by sevens  and we think of warm brownies  go do that in your office  go do it in your office  and well wait for these guys to show up  ill wait for you to show up  andy  you coming out tonight part owner of the club  uh yes  let me ask you a quick question  whats the youngest a girl can be  that if uh we go out im not a total scumbag  you know the old rule  half your age plus seven  half my age plus seven oh okay  well im 29 so half of   thats only 20is   21  20 years old   21  and a half    yup  yup  we got the same thing with the equation on that one  heres the thing  what if shes slightly younger  can i go out with someone younger than that  please you totally can  yeah  tom says its okay  that probably means it isnt okay  thank you for meeting with me again  i dont even know really what i wanna say  but i guess i just dont get it  you know our relationship was so great  mark honestly it was really nice  but maybe you thought it was so amazing  because youve never dated someone for so long before  well but for example we barely ever fought  thats not a good sign  youre supposed to fight sometimes  youresupposed to miss the other person  even if theyre only gone for 20 minutes  and i just didnt feel that  did you  man i uh  i should have yelled at you way more  well paul just called  theyre on their way  oh god theyre gonna fire people arent they  yeah i am two years from my pension  relax

 okay  chris is the most positive state budget  auditing consultant ive ever met  i mean i made eye contact with him  and it was like  staring into the sun  people  we are here from the state budget office  from indianapolis  ooh what does that mean  well simply we are here to tinker with your budget  think of the government as a broken down carousel  were gonna slap on a new coat of paint  were

one of the best people on the planet  hes universally adored here  if you fired him there would be a revolt  okay you need to understand  that just to keep this town afloat  we probably have to cut the budget  of every department by 40 or 50 okay  well but chris said that you just had to  you know tinker with things  yeah he said that because that sounds a lot better than  were going to gut it
