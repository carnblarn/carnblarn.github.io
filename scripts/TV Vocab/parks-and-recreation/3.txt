                okay nowseeheres a good example of a plant that you cant eat  see all the spikes  so two things oneits poisonous and twoit would hurt  the parks department has so many programs  jerrys in charge of our preteen nature hikes  for a whileit was a teenage nature hike  but then we changed it because a girl got pregnant  look what we have here country honeysuckle  yeahtake a look at that  its pretty and it smells good   mmsmells great  yeahits really nice  ohthats bitter leslieyou dont eat it  why did you let me eat that i never told you to eat that  ohgod lesliethe animals know you

what other plants we could eatjerry  but i have to say its a very sweet aftertaste though  so i have a piece of good news  ive invited a reporter to come do an article about the pit behind your house  she writes for the pawnee journalwhich is kind of like our towns washington post  that sounds really good  thank youann it is a classic strategy  the press is a weaponand you can use it to kill people or to feed people  you knowthe beginning of projects are very vulnerable  cause the momentum of that can kind of keep it aliveor else itll die  i meanim sure you remember the tucker park graffiti removal project  the tucker parker graffiti removal project was a great idea  that just ran out of steam  we had removed five cartoon penisesnot even 10  when we were shut down due to lack of funding  to this dayi am haunted by those remaining penises  one penis in particular  now when the reporter gets hereit is vital  that we all follow my rules about how to deal with the media  rule number one stay on message  this is key all we need to talk about is the pit  and the fact that were gonna turn it into a park  and thats it okay  number two what  stay on message again yesits that important  its one and two stay on message and stay on message right  stay on whatann  message great  leslie formed a committee to fill the pit in a week  which is really impressive  i mean until nowmy only

very sensitive  somethings come to my attention that requires your attention  it has come to my attention that you had sex with ms malwaetweep  uhthats personal  its unethical and its irresponsible for a public servant to have sex  with a member of the press corps  especially when you have sex with someone who is so skanky i meanhave sex with her i di  im gonna say something i dont want you to take it the wrong way  but youre being a huge dork  welli cant allow that kind of behavior from someone serving on my subcommittee  well then i resign from your subcommittee  shauna malwaetweep  hithis is deputy director of parks and recreation leslie  yeshi hi  i accidentally ate an old burrito what  i was acting strange at the pit and the reason is because i had food poisoning  from an old burrito  soi was hoping we could have a doover interview  maybe over lunch im buying  yeahi guess im free im assuming not mexican  oh  yeahwell it wasnt a mexican burrito  are you sure thats the best thing for you right now  ohits the best thing on the menu  so looki feel like i may have gone a little off message at the pit  yeahyou seemed a little weird welli wouldnt say weird its just  were trying to turn a dangerous eyesore into a beautiful community park  and a positive article could go a long way towards making that happen  great so what do you think the odds are that this park is actually gonna get made  can i say over 100  because i would be lying if i said less  you seem a lot more confident than some of the other people ive spoken to  can i read you some of these quotes  be my guest the sullivan street pit is always going to be a pit  welluntil it turns into a park  yesi agree  heyyou should write an article on unicornsbecause theyre more likely to exist than this park  ohreally tell that to a 14yearold girl  you should write an article on the pope getting marriedbecause thats more likely to happen than this park  there are some countries where the pope can be married  you should write an article on talking monkeys really have you seen the wizard of oz  you should write an article about leprechauns leprechauns exist  you should write an article about the sun falling out of the sky  why would you write an article about that thats this one is just no  umthis park is neverevereverever going to happen  might i ask who said that uhmark brendanawicz  yeah hey  hi can i talk to you for a second  yeahwhats up  uhyou and i need to find a way to fix this reporter thing  why is this a big deal to anybody  well apparentlythe reporter is gonna print
