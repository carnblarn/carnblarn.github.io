                okay as everybody knows  the spirit of pawnee was defaced again last night   what was it this time  chocolate pudding  thats new  the mural that normally resides here is called the spirit of pawnee  and its very controversial  weve had someone throw acid at it  tomato sauce  someone tried to stab it once  we really need better security here  we also need better lessoffensive history  so the city council has decided it should be changed  to something a little less horrifying  now since the murals were made  by government employees back in the 1930s  we thought it might be fun if each department  submitted the design for a new mural  and youll submit your concepts tomorrow afternoon  all righty folks thank you very much  leslie whats your design gonna be a tree  joe you work in sewage  your department literally specializes in crap   you wanna do this  i told you before  crap is a slang term  and i dont like that term  but at least we dont specialize in losing like you guys  sewage lets roll  damn  how does sewage always get the hottest interns    episode 209 the camel  mpm  lestat78  guys this department has the chance  to design something that could be in this building forever  this could be our legacy  i thought building a park on lot 48 was gonna be our legacy  you can have two  look at madonna great singer amazing arms  look at oj simpson heisman trophy winner naked gun  no offense leslie but im not an artist  thats not true ive seen your fingernails  i pay someone to do this  really  shoot anyway  im ordering all of you to design a mural  only ron can order the whole department to do something   ron order them to do this  do whatever leslie says    and it needs to be breathtaking and moving and historical  and better than every department and you have one hour  designers make it work  tim gunn  you my friend are ready to go dancing  thank you sir  all right next  andrew looking good  business is booming  hey ron how about you need a little dog waxin  its 5 bucks and youll cut in front of him   what  beat it  this is ron swanson were talking about  im impressed with andy  pulling himself up by his bootstraps  reminds me of me  i got my first job when i was nine worked at a sheet metal factory  in two weeks i was running the floor  child labor laws are ruining this country   do you have a key in your shoe  no i have a bunion  thats practically its own toe  normally the pain howls through my loafers like a banshee on the moors  but for these past three minutes  its been reduced to a faint growl  that was neat  we are all finished  that was great thank you son  no sweat  next  shouldnt let your friends cut in line its not good business  you know what else isnt good business   that guys my friend  right  im saying  you shouldnt let your friends cut in line  sorry kyle here give me this  next  so what are you looking for exactly  i dont know man  the spirit of pawnee thats all i got  here just gimme 20 worth of art  just something that seems personal that only i could have done   well tell me about yourself  no just paint  i have no interest in art let me clarify  i have no interest in nonnude images  dude what the hell kind of art is this  looks like a lizard puking up skittles  im an abstract expressionist  no youre a con artist and im a guy thats out 20 bucks  whatever  im a terrible artist  but the parks department has done so much for me  that if i can help them out in any way i will  oh god  maybe i should just give them all free flu shots  i know everything about this town and these murals  and thats why this is a dream come true literally  i have had a dream where i designed a mural  but then it turned into a nightmare because the mural started talking  and it came alive it was whispering and i couldnt hear what it was saying  so i leaned in close and then it ate me  at one point gina gershon was there  my piece is truly gonna capture the spirit of pawnee  never understood the term elbow grease  i guess its not really grease  just hard work   nice shiny shoes you got there  i was just  oh no shoot  actually it looks like i scuffed this one  do you need your money back cause i already spent it  really how did  never mind  i think ill just take another full polish  can i cut in line again  i feel right at home as a shoeshine  i have no idea what im doing  but i know im doing it really really well  okay lets get goin with the spirit of pawnee   ann you go first  okay  since its the parks department  i thought i would design a pretty park  with uh dogs playing i cant really draw  so i just cut some stuff out of a magazine  that looks like something a death row convict would make in art therapy  dude i tried  and you failed  its dogs and people playing in a park   its cute  its okay sweetheart  you cant make art because you are art  youre beautiful but that sucks  lets see yours  fine mine is amazing its gonna blow your mind  some professionalass art right here   im not sure what im looking at  its abstract leslie  over here you got some shapes  and then you come over to this side  you know its actually kind of interesting  each shape is its own thing  but then when it comes together  it really gives you a sense of  completion  a piece of art caused me to have an emotional reaction  is that normal  so its the last supper  but with famous people from indiana  john mellancamp larry bird  michael jackson  david letterman vivica a fox  okay so heres where it gets a little dicey  cause theres not that many celebrities from indiana so a nascar  my friend becky ron swanson  whos the jesus  that would be greg kinnear   i didnt know he was from indiana  yeah you know i read that he was  do you think hes the best choice for jesus  he was great on er   greg kinnear wasnt in er  yeah he was  i dont think that he was  who am i thinking of  okay next  really good jerry  for my murinal  i was inspired by the death of my grandma  you said murinal   no i didnt  you said murinal i heard it   anyway she  jerry  why dont you put that murinal in the mens room  so people can murinate all over it  go to the doctor you might have a murinary tract infection   just wanted to show you my art  murinal murinal murinal  disqualified  its pointillism  and each dot is a photo of a citizen of the town  no one cares at all  so this is a multimedia project  first  a bunch of rats made out of garbage  and  this is a tv screen  itll be like a big flat screen tv  and itll play looped video of knee surgeries  and this is a humansized hamster wheel that will be next to the mural  if we can get one and itll be spinning  and therell be like a fat guy in it all the time  like screaming and like eating raw beef and like bleeding  and like blood will come out of his mouth and stuff  and thatll be like right next to  the mural  i have one question  why  if you have to ask you dont get it  i dont think they really got the assignment  if were gonna beatthe others  we have to choose something that will stand the test of time  like the mona lisa  or the music of squeeze  june 8 1922  the pawnee bread factory burned to the ground  we lost a lot of good bread that day  as well as several human lives  and it also made the whole town smell like toast  which one resident described as disturbingly enticing  but i digress  the point is we rebuilt pawnee  to the wonderful town that it is today  why would you want a mural that shows people dying  when you could have shapes that come alive  because its the most famous event in our towns history  and people love voting for tragedy  look at the oscars this is our holocaust movie  this is our english patient  sounds like youre exploiting the tragedy  see ann gets it  time to vote everybody  cast your votes  may the best most tragic project win  when we started this we were six different voices  with six ideas for a mural  and then those six voices came together as a team  there are no losers today  but there is one winner  us  the parks department  tom the results of the vote please  one to one to one to one to one to one  we all voted for ourselves didnt we  third time today  thats a good shoeshine  what the  man  i dont know what happened  frankly  i emitted a noise  the noise was involuntary  sometimes a sound is just a sound you know  we need to whittle these down can we all agree on eliminating   any of these designs  anns blows  dont hold back  its a giant picture of a park thats not art  at least its not a fat human hamster eating meat   you dont work here  you both have a point  ann yours was a little trite  and april yours was hellish and might make someone vomit  theres something about those shapes theres some emotional art right there   any kid could do that  no kid could do that  only god could do that  what is so great about the shapes  he likes the shapes okay and hes part of the team  so here take these scissors and cut out your favorite shapes  and then well put them on a new team mural  were gonna make a new design  that takes the best parts of all of our designs  its like if you got michelangelo  and andy warhol  and jackson pollock and jim davis from garfield  to do one painting  imagine how good that painting would be  i think its really good  ill be right back  we need you for something  can it wait i am so swamped here  anns in trouble  we think it might be pills   what  no  thats a lie  but this is as important look at a piece of art  god  what is that  this is our entry for the mural contest  we couldnt decide on one design so we took parts  that we all liked of our designs and then we just kind of  smooshed it into a thing  you made a camel  youve never heard that saying  a camel is actually a horse designed by a committee  and what you guys have here  is one ugly camel  featuring bill paxton   greg kinnear  right  is bill paxton from indiana  you have to save us you have to design something   leslie im not an artist  yes you are  ive seen you sketch things  like poles for stop signs  that everybody stops and looks at  by law theyre required to  please youre the only one of us whos got any talent  i know youll do something good  and i really want to win this  please what are you gonna do tonight  i was gonna go to arbys and watch frontline  here we go  so it is an old man  feeding pigeons in a park  the spirit of pawnee maybe   you gotta be kidding me  how is that better than mine  it isnt and thats saying something  and whos the man is he famous  is it martin landau  i have no dog in this fight im just saying that this will win  its nothing its mush  theres not even one shape in there where are the shapes  im not saying this is any good  im saying that thisll win its mass appeal its like  what motels put up  and it hangs there for years and no one ever throws acid at it   who did this i like it  seriously  sorry  it comforts me  thatll win  this is  garbage weve gotta go back to the shapes  this is boring go back to the garbage  i would take the shapes over this come on  i wouldnt take them over anything id take jerrys murinal over this  no guys   this is the one  what  sorry marks right  this is an outrage hes not  in the department   neither is ann  but anns hot  and that counts  whatever happened to were the parks department  rah rah rah down with the sewage department  we spent all day here for no reason  we have a reason were gonna win thats our reason  our designs are not gonna win marks might win  how great would it be if we won  youll feel a lot better i promise you  after you win were going with this one  ill see you at the presentation tomorrow  that is an order team go team  team dismissed  yes we are a team but i am the team leader  so i made a bold decision  were playing it safe  hows life in the parks defartment  better than life in the sewage defartment   which makes more sense  whatever  you are screwed  get used to this  because its gonna be hanging on the wall right outside your door  for the next 100 years  that was pretty good  you think theyre gonna win  they went superpatriotic its a classic mistake  it seems crowdpleasing but its a stance  and theres always someone wholl oppose a stance  us  old man feeding pigeons no stance  absolutely no point of view whatsoever  no point of view smart  i havent been back  i wish him good luck in his business  and yes i will absolutely go back  to get my shoes shined soon  i dont frankly see  why this is a topic for discussion  whats up  you know the thing   the other day  other day other day  yesterday  i am  that was  im okay you know id be okay if we  if we never mentioned it again  never mentioned what  the moan the weird moan you made  that was superweird do you not remember that  i talked about it with the lady who went after for 12 hour  she said she thought it was an animal  it was just an odd moment  lets just not talk about it anymore  thats what i was trying to say  but yeah okay  good job   miss knope  chief konner  what do you got  well we arent really artists but we gave it a shot  its your basic dogs playing poker  but with an everythingsonfire theme  this is my nephew over here  and this is an attractive lady with a hamburger for a head  just some stuff we like  anyway we had a lot of fun putting it together  good luck   go ahead  what  the camels way more fun  i want my team back  and my team made this  hot crazy camel mess  so this is what were gonna submit  even if it means we lose  god i hope we win but were definitely gonna lose  probably  and ann how ann gets it done  lets go  what are the shapes  the shapes are awesome is what they are  you cant handle it  no i like them  forgive me  is that michael jackson   the pride of indiana  thats right so its relevant  who is he carrying  jesus greg kinnear  it looks like hes carrying kinnear into the burning building  thats because hes moonwalking  so he  should be goin the other way  that did not occur to me   sorry  so there you go  the spirit of pawnee  we didnt win  but neither did anyone else  they realized it was gonna cost a ton of money to hire a muralist  so theyre just gonna restore the old one  theyre changing the title to the diversity express  look at that   its not as good as the other one  i dont know what you mean by good  neither do i  just do another one  i have actual assignments that i have to finish for art school  shut up and do more art for me  this ones racist  its beautiful  ive looked at this for five hours now  i like the green one and the red circle right here  im tearing up man
