special okay   oh  your department  all the way down here  is not a priority  and frankly youre not even supposed to be  in the building leslie  youre nonessential  that is not your call  i know its on your badge  this this isnt me  ann perkins  chrissomething  hi i was just doing my daily lunchtime ten miles  and i ran by the hospital  and i thought id pop up and say hi  did you just start your run  no im already at mile nine  but youre not sweating at all   i knowi have a resting heart rate  of 28 beats per minute  the scientist who studied me said that my heart  could pump jet fuel up into an airplane  id love to go out on a date with you  i think you might find me attractive  because you got drunk and kissed me when we first met  and no pressure but i do have tonight open  im so sorry im really busy right now  no problem i will try again soon ann perkins  thats the guy who likes you that youre not into  yeah  and which part of him are you not looking at  traditionally  when i end a longterm relationship  im a little fragile  and i have a tendency to do some reckless things  so i need to stay away from chris  i cant stand this government shutdown  i cant stand this budget crisis  but what i cant stand  is theyre canceling freddy spaghetti  you know everything what should i do about this  i dont know leslie  why dont you see a movie or go shopping or try   wait a minute what are you doing  whats happening  um  you know they offered me a buyout and i took it  and so now i work for norton construction  sorry i know i shouldnt have done that   thats okay  how could you quit  you know not everyone  has your enthusiasm for this work  you know i guess ive been mispronouncing your name  all these years  mark brendanaquits  recently i had been thinking about maybe  um leaving this job  but i felt like i needed a sign  and then ann broke up with me  the week that i was going to propose  the government got shut down  and yesterday  one of those pigeons took a bleep on me  and i was indoors so  what are you doing here  hey sorry i need your help  is this a bad time  lucys here  im in my sexy pajamas  i just took four benadryls to dull my sensitivity  yes it is a bad time  youre about to have sex  why else would boys 2 mens on bended knee  be playing right now  okay i just want to give you a little advice  which is dont make it last really long  ladies dont like that   okay great  okay  wait just one more thing  are you using protection  you know im just gonna stay away  from all guys right now  yeah less man time more ann time   yeah  yeah  the only guy that i care about right now  is six feet tall with wild crazy hair  and a ukulele that doubles as a water gun  freddy spaghetti oh  childrens concerts arent a priority these days  you know what is sewage  pawnees kids are less important than poop tubes  i dont know i mean what are you gonna do  thats the way it is and   wait wait wait wait wait wait wait  if all the parks are closed  why not just have the concert in the lot behind my house  ann you devious bastard  well the cow goes moo   and the pig goes oink   well ive spent the last three hours  coming up with the plan  and i sent up the bat signal  for all the people in the parks department  to come and join us  i told them to be here by 800  do you think anybodys gonna show up  a yes  b even if they dont  well just put the concert on ourselves  but c yes yestheyre definitely gonna show up  although d maybe not  i think that you need to prepare for  the eventuality that no one  hello  ohh  god bless you jerry gergich  wow  never thought id hear those words from you   hey  aprils here move jerry  april  i didnt think you were gonna help  i still might not  jerry how do you feel about lifting heavy things   ooh my doctor just said i should avoid   being a wuss yes i agree  so go out there and get the equipment out of the truck  with current and projected deficits  we need to cut expenditures by 32  lets make it an even 40  oh thats not necessary  slash it slash it  i am an official member of a task force  dedicated to slashing the city budget  just saying that gave me a semi  right off the bat  we sell city hall  let somebody turn it into a large gas station  or a tj maxx  ron that is a very creative idea  but we dont want to sell any of our major assets  because we dont want to lose out  on any future revenue streams  i hear that  dont worry i have tons more ideas   okay uh  so sorry  new ringtone  dont cut anything without me  leslie  i dont care if you hate what we do  i love it enough for both of us  were gonna put on the freddy spaghetti concert  today 500 on lot 48  you cant do that  watch me were gonna do this ron  with or without you  hammering away  unh  crank it hit it  needs 16 minutes for premium bounce  oh hey after this can you go pick up freddy spaghetti  in your mercedes  we need to give him the star treatment  hey sorry were late  i had to wait on my girlfriend  to finish eating breakfast  hi im lucy  hi  we had dinner last night  andbreakfast this morning  what were doing in between  sex stuff  you guys know tom really well  so i dont have to apologize for his behavior right

called you a gajillion times  why didnt you call me back  oh im so sorry  i was too busy not wanting to talk to you   huh  jerry what are you doing  leslie asked me to post these around the neighborhood   ill do it  really wow   yes  thanks  you want some help with that  okay lets talk about parks and rec  this ones a little complicated  i know whatll loosen up our brains  a massage train  and i know what youre thinking  its not that i want a massage ill be the caboose  and ron swanson is the locomotive  and thanks to ron the services budget  has already been cut significantly  so seems like the best option is job cuts  starting with leslie knope  ho ho  no no no no no  if you fire leslie  you might as well just get rid of the department  look i know how valuable she is believe me  but weve run out of options  there are plenty of other options  for example sell the zoo animals  okay to whom  cosmetics labs  weird restaurants  im just spitballing here  okay lets switch it up  look she makes the second highest salary  in the department  that will go a long way  im telling you its just not an option  come on focus up buddy  give me a sec  will you just stop and listen to me  no  fine i dont want to talk to you anyways  reverse psychiatry  fine what  i like you  in a you know  romantical kind of way  you do  yes  do you  like me  yes  ha  so thenperhaps  shall we go out this evening  no  ahem  i dont think we should see each other  damn it because youre 21  and im 29  no  i dont care about that  its because whenever i see you talk to ann  or talk about ann  i feel like you still have feelings for her  what no i dont but i dont  really i dont  well i think do  so  thats a problem for me  because of my libertarian beliefs  leslie does 95 of the work  so you should lay me off  id be proud to be a casualty  in this righteous war  its precisely because of your beliefs  that we need to keep you  you would maintain fiscal responsibility  after were gone  i strenuously object  well ron were moving on  every departments losing a leslie knope  no ben they are not  no other department has one to begin with  right now shes singlehandedly  putting up some lousy concert  for the citys kids  shes doing what  could someone else massage my shoulders  wow looking good  yeah i mean i wish wed built one of those elevators  that comes up from
