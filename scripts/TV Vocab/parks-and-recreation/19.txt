one best friend  kind of wish shed told me that you went to indiana  but whatever  so youre in charge of amusement parks right  god thats exciting  actually its regular parks  like swings and slides

be assisting ron  but ron really doesnt do much government work  so youd really be working for me  im interested in real world expertise  i got a nightclub opening to go to  which tie do i wear  i like the one on the left  that was a trick question  the answer is this one  tell me about you tell me about your friends  be as superficial as possible  i meet a girl at a bar  she seems kind of into me could go either way  i get her number its two days later  what do i text her  it was nice meeting you  no zack  i dont text her it was nice meeting you  i wait eight weeks  and i text her whats crackin  so do you enjoy it  being an mri technician  great question  someone steps into the room  imagine a mother of three maybe shes a teacher  she knows somethings wrong but she doesnt know what it is  shes scared  in less than an hour i know what it is  whats wrong with her  i dont know  but the best part about being an mri technician is  i can see inside everything  see that guy over there  imagine being able to look inside his head   wow  i know  could look inside the steak or this butter or this bread  you can look inside anything  well if you look inside this bread  all youre gonna find is more bread  i dont know id have to do an mri  anyway its good that you found your calling  i mean ive never even had an mri before  what  i dont know about this  well im offering you a free scan  usually costs up to 2000  im kind of spoiling you here  well i am a little curious  good  cause frankly i dont want to invest in someone  who only has three months to live  oh  im just trying to think of this as an adventure  you know  just getting right back on that horse  even if that horse is crazy  and want to peer inside my body  how does that feel  uh weird  perfect  oh youre not on your period are you  no does that matter  well not for this  okay its gonna be a little cramped in there  dont worry ill be right on the other side of that glass  just your basic assistant stuff  taking messages wakeup calls  muscle milk runs condom runs  bottle service to the snakehole lounge  that kind of stuff  sorry what do i get out of this  connections plus 19 grand a year  minus my 10 headhunters fee  i have to pay you two grand if i get hired  i have a job to offer  in the immortal words of rob blagojevich  its a valuable thing  you just dont give it away for nothing  so you never told me where youre from   im from pawnee  keep still please  what kind of music do you like  can i answer that  sure keep still  all kinds  its very important  that you keep still at this moment leslie  ive told you that 1000 times  did you ever break your arm  you can answer that here ill turn it off  one time i was on my bike  and some boys were making fun of me  so i chased them and i lost control  im surprised you can see that  it was like three years ago  i cant believe i turned the machine off for that  you never had any kids right leslie   no  you should  youve got a great oven  okaytime to go  youve got ample room in there  honestly if you wanted to  you could go triplets right off the bat leslie  you got a big industrialsized oven  so were done right  hey hows the date

dating  yeah okay  hey no cell phones  what was that about  i set leslie up on a date  i dont think its going that well  oh no with uh with justin  oh no this guy i know from the hospital  why not justin  i dont really see them together  you know  plus leslie just got out of a relationship  so i didnt want justin to be like her rebound guy  or anything you know  yeah that makes sense  leslie is a notoriously cruel and thoughtless person  why are we talking about this  were not  you got a large brain  thank you  yeah no it looks pretty  hang on  thats weird  what whats weird  your brain  you see that shadow right there  whatis that bad  i dont know id have a doctor  look at that immediately if i were you  are you serious  oh wait  oh  it was like a smudge or something  crazy  thank god i was here  mark ive never gone out with him  i swear  im sorry but theres just something weird  about the way you talk about him  i dont know i mean there was definitely times  when we thought maybe we would go out someday but  thats why you didnt set leslie up  because youre saving him  no im not  oh yeah you are  okay fine you dont have someone in your life  that you think i dont know  maybe if things were different maybe someday  you know what  you cant save somebody for the future  while youre in a relationship  even i know that  come on dont go  ill talk to you later  and by the way  the dog dies at the end  so did you want to go back to your place or  actually chris it was nice to meet you  but i think this is gonna be our last date  i get it  you get your mri and get out huh  this

didnt do anything wrong  come here this is none of your business  you dont know what youre talking about  actually i do know what im talking about  every time i used to sit around all afternoon  playing video games wearing only my slippers  all of a sudden i would start to feel bad about myself  and do you know why  didnt you just explain why  i would feel bad about myself  because i would start to think about this perfect guy  any time you would talk about justin  i didnt feel very important  that was rough  well i didnt know that  maybe if you had i wouldnt have left  but you do know
