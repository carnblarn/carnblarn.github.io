hes acquired quite a bit of gold  you gold digger  you are literally a gold digger  the thing i love about tammy is she calls me on my crap  every guy needs that  okay if you want this company to survive  you immediately need to downsize  i mean you dont need this airplane hangar  um i think we do and two  you have to keep detailed financial records  thank you ive been trying to tell them that  waste of time  they wouldnt know a nonemployee  taxreportable expenditure request  if it bit them in the ass  hey guys which two people here started their own company  cause im pretty sure it wasnt

flattered  whos this whos this tall drink of water  andy hey andy   hows it hanging  listen  we need to break ron from her spell  cant you just move your butt around  or wear a dress made out of meat  well i could do all of those things and have but that bitch is crazy  when ron left her and we got together  she threw acid on my foot  ew could we take a peek at it  listen tammy one was my sunday school teacher too  she can pinpoint your weaknesses  and then destroy you with just one word  and ajar of acid  oh my god  i think i have an idea that could save ron  dont joke around andy  i have ideas too  you were right to come get me  my son ronny always had a weakness for those ladies  oh wow is this ron  yep at the age of five  hes standing next to the first chair he ever built  oh my god

oldfashioned prairie drinkoff  oh whats in that jug it smells like jet fuel  thats swanson family mash liquor  made from the finest corn ever grown on american soil  its only legal use is to strip varnish off of speedboats  if you win hes all yours  and if i win i bring him back to the farm for good  wait what that wasnt the deal  pour it im thirsty  pour me one too then let me in here  im going to join you and if i win ron stays here with us  leslie no dont drink that  we use it to burn warts off of the mules  poison  ugh  i made a mistake  i made a mistake  diabetes  how were we together for five months  well you know its possible you could just date a guy  because of where you are in your life emotionally  i mean i suppose youre right john  ann perkins  i hate to say this but i have a stain on my shirt  which means that everything weve shot so far is unusable  but lets use this as an opportunity to revisit the script  delivery guy hey  diabetes  had enough  of this watereddown baby formula  not even close  not even close  marvin clonse  glenn close  leslie you dont have to do this  shh go to bed jimmy  blech  i cant feel my face my face is numb  what is that  and together we can make a difference  thats it i think weve got it  do you think we got it yes  yeah we have it we had it seven hours ago  oh ann i know that i can be intense  but im only trying to be the best me that i can be  i want to thank you for this opportunity  and your patience  and your intelligence and  your insight  you really are an amazing human being  thank you  oh right thats why i dated him  hey  i wanted to apologize  uh we brought in five accountants to look at e 720  and they all said the same thing you did  if we dont start making changes  were going to lose the company
