different  my life would have been if your mother had married me  it would have been better ill tell you that much   frank are you okay  im fine im good  i am just so nervous to see her   there is nothing to be nervous about  have you got a bag or something   do you have a bag  i have a purse   give him your purse  all right  i mean that sucked didnt it  maybe if you sang it like louis armstrong  maybe yeah  i mean heres the thing though  who is that  my problem is i dont know  how to tell if were doing good  because when you play rock its easy to know if youre doing great  because
