man  ronron come here  come here for a bit youre good right there  listen you got to jump on the tommytown express  this guy has some of the best investment ideas  ive ever heard in my life  make a baby tuxedo clothing line  a department store with a guest list  white fur ear muffs for men  contact lenses that display text messages  invent a phone that smells good  own a night club called

hey by the way i dont think i can get that book back  from um whatshisname  oh thats okay  i mean i shouldve known better  than to loan something to one of your boyfriends  they come and go so fast  uh what are you saying exactly  well i mean lets be honest  how long is it gonna last with this guy  sitting right here  i dont know hes dumb but hes fun  thank you  i mean thats the whole point of dating around  is you get to try on a bunch of different hats  well this hat is an idiot  ha ha classic  leslie are you mad that i came here  what no  im not are you you seem mad at me  no im not im not mad at you   im not mad at you  im not mad at all   neither am i  no  looks like you two need to kiss and make up   all right  reow  hello my name is ron swanson  in general i try never to speak with people  but i have been drinking this snakejuice thing  and its damn good  you should buy it  yeah okay thanks man  son you should know that my recommendation  is essentially a guarantee  drink this now  traegermeister you made it  yeah i got your email we need to talk  first off though try a little snakejuice  its 140 proof  which means its 70 alcohol  but dont worry  theres plenty caffeine in it to keep you awake  i believe an ounce of that would literally kill me  you emailed everyone at city hall  and told them to come to a club  that you own to buy alcohol that you invented  government employees cant use their power  to enhance their personal wealth  i totally get your point chris  it wont happen again  i just dont see any way around it  youre gonna have to sell your shares in the snakehole  no  tpain this guy bothering you   this is my boss  okay yeah  you want me to write a rap about your name  yes  b to the o to the double s   do what he say and youll be successful   no offense but maybe you think im going too fast  cause youre going too slow with ben  no offense but im going slow because i might lose my job  okay no offense but maybe thats  a little bit of an excuse for not acting on your feelings  no offense but i dont remember you  having a nursing degree in feelings  offense thats rude  im gonna go dance  douche youre up  uh uh mmm  hey are you okay i heard yelling  yeah im very angry and im really drunk  do you want to dance with me go get me another snorkjuice  oh thats maybe not the best idea for you  forget it jeanralphio   yes im here  dance up on me  yes yes yes  this is my first fight with ann  and its a doozy  but i believe that honest discussions between friends  can lead to deeper intimacy  this is a watershed moment in our relationship  and its important that we fight clean  all i need to do is focus and stay calm  youre stupid and youre drunk and youre stupid  oh i dont understand how this is my fault  its not everything isnt your fault all the time  dont always make everything your fault  good its not all my fault im not the stupid jerk  im not the one whos being a stupid jerk right now  i didnt mean it like that  you know i didnt mean it like that  i just meant you were being stupid  and you were acting like a jerk  look im sorry that i thought about you for the job okay  but sometimes if i dont push you in the right direction  you end up standing still  i was just trying to do you a favor  enough with your favors okay  stop  maybe we shouldnt work together then  maybe we shouldnt  every time i cleanse i can literally  feel the toxins leaving my body  i know i feel so much healthier  ive still got a full week to go before the broth stage  mmm prebroth is an amazing stage  its when youre most alert  good someone needs to be alert tonight  this snakejuice is basically rat poison  everybodys wasted  you dont even know one thing i didnt even say one thing  and then she asked me the whole thing  and i didnt even do it once  im like an elephant okay  if i walk into a room its like okay hes in there  baba booey  turn this music down  farts and poop and love and stuff   macaroni salad      is this everybody  ann took a cab  toms in the trunk jerrys on the roof  all right where to first  your mothers butt  im so alone  if even one of you thinks about dry heaving in my car  youre all walking home  leslie  im here  we have to go hire a new pr director  for the health department  oh my god im so hungover  ive never been this hungover  i feel great i ran 5k this morning  really  no i

thank you we will let you know  then our heads will explode and we will die   oh god  oh  i cannot believe that fight i had with ann  look im sure you guys can work it out  i owe her like a million apologies  i think i owe you one too   im sorry  for what  i dont know  are you okay  no im sad   say thanks chum  ugh  ill get those papers delivered for you  whatever  posthaste  the doctor says its probably not serious but it might be  oh kyle please stop talking  why isnt it bert macklin  what are you doing here and who is this sorry charlie  im janet snakehole  i demand answers and i want them now  honey please i love you  no offense but bert macklin died last night  after the tenth shot of snakejuice  okay sorry  miss snakehole  you think id let you get away that easily  bert macklin may be dead  but im his brother kip hackman  why wouldnt you have his same last name  shut up kyle  i know you boosted those paintings  maybe it was me but ill never tell you where they are  and youll never have my body either  sorry to hear the news tom  were gonna miss you around the club  hey you own shares too why didnt chris make you sell  cause chris doesnt know  you know what  snitches get stitches   donna come on  dont  im a natural moneymaker  i got into government for the connections  this was supposed to be a thing that led to the other thing  its like when vin dboiler room  thats what lead to him being xxx and doing furious  and furious yeah i know  listen i dont like all this negativity man  why dont you turn that frizzown upsidedizzity  huh this sucks man  oh  youre wearing snow pants  i got home last night  and i thought i might go sledding  can i come in   yeah if youre quiet  okay  uh leslie doesnt know im here  oh god so high school  i cant believe that leslie and i got drunk in a bar  and fought about boys  were so much better than that  i just keep having flashes of things  that we said to each other  and shes so important to me  i feel like such a dick  i know she feels awful  i mean technically we all do  yeah what the hell is in snakejuice  demerol  all i know is leslies always talking  about how lucky she is to have you as a friend  and i just wanted you to know that  youre nice  i can see why she likes you  when did she say likes me  oh god this is so high school  just rent a limo ask her to the prom  im sure shell say yes  all right thanks  so let me get this straight  tom tries to get off the government teat  and we punish him  that doesnt make any sense to me  im sorry rules are rules  i wish there was something we could do  ben is there something we can do  damn it bens not here  toms not scamming anyone  hes not savvy enough to manipulate the system like that  hes just a kid chasing a goofy dream  im sorry my hands are tied  jan cooper was a terrible wife  i just want everybody to know that  thank you dennis  but we cant give you your job back  you sound just like her   that was unpleasant  yeah  all right whos next  you came  yeah i had some encouragement  your sweaters on inside out  and backwards  its been a tough morning  lots of regret and shame  that should be the official slogan for snakejuice  well uh this committee would like to ask  if you are the kind of candidate  who could forgive someone  after theyve behaved like a complete jackass  this candidate could  especially because this candidate also behaved  like a total jackass  please dont worry about it  the committee totally understands  also i can talk about my qualifications  for this position  but first i am gonna go throw up in a wastebasket  would you mind if i joined you  not at all  shall we  ann came in the next day  and had a second interview with chris  she nailed it of course  but she doesnt want to totally leave her job  so they struck up a deal  she works at city hall parttime  and two days a week she still gets to be  the greatest nurse in the world  winwin  we need to remember whats important in life  friends waffles and work  or waffles friends work it doesnt matter  but work is third  so listen crazy ira check this out okay  im at this club last night just killing it  the snakehole lounge  oh yeah is
