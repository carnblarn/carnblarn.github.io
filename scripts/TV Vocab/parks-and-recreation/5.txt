                today we are welcoming a delegation  from the parks department of our sister city  boraqua venezuela  our photoop with the mayor is tomorrow at 300 pm  so im going to need your suggestions about my wardrobe asap  i told you goldsequined sweatpants  also remember everyone  venezuela is a poor country  these men are not used  to the wealth and flash that we have here in central indiana  our only job over the next two days is to make these men feel at home  yes i am a little nervous  pawnee has kind of a tricky history  with welcoming foreign visitors  but things have changed  our guests are going to stay in a motel for sure    episode 205 sister city  mpm  albator1932  lestat78  oh god what if they dont speak english  april you know spanish right      oh good excellent  my moms puerto rican  thats why im so lively and colorful  oh my god here they are okay everybody clean up  pull your thing up everyone just be good  jerry hit it  this is my baby  i put this whole trip together  and let me tell you something it has not been easy  you know how do you fit all of pawnee in a 48hour visit  i had to drop the rockandroll bowling alley from our itinerary  one of the most difficult phone calls ive ever had to make  hello most excellent representatives  of the great parks department of boraqua venezuela  i am deputy director of parks and recreation  and chairwoman of the departmental ad hoc  subcommittee for pit beautification leslie knope  its a pleasure i am vice director ejecutivo del diputado  del departamento de parques  raul alejandro bastilla pedro de veloso de maldonado  im tom  these are my colleagues antonio riverafonseca  minister of small fountains  and elvis correja administrator of hedges  and he is  pay no attention to him  hes our intern johnny he is worthless  we are quite tired from our trip  could you have your servant collect our bags please   what did he call me  its a different culture okay  just be a good host and do this for me  fine  yes well get our pathetic servant boy to fetch your luggage go boy  now i know you gentlemen had a long flight  but i have prepared a welcome party in your honor  excellent i like to party  well my job is to see to your every need  do we just select the woman we desire  i will take the large black one   interesting choice  what  do you have some kind of a book with photos of the women available  if not i will also take the sexy black one  i am not surprised at all  ive been to south america i did very well there  there might have been a translation problem  when i said party i meant one that did not include sex for pay  but one that had food and drink and dancing  that sort of thing  so no women  off to kind of a weird start  we have so much to learn from each other   what kind of birds do you eat  chickens  us too amazing  what is this  water  im sorry agua  in our country government officials drink only bottled water  that waters very safe to drink  no bottled  please send the boy  tom go get water   leslie come on  for your troubles  you got it chief         can you help me out a second  go away jerry    this is a goldplated replica of a gun hugo chavez used  in the 1992 socialist revolution  it is a gift  this gun truly symbolizes the blossoming peace  between our two nations  a key aspect to diplomacy is giftgiving  the gift has to be nice enough to honor and respect the guest  but not so nice that it shames him  plus it needs to represent the local culture  and i found the perfect thing  a bottle of highfructose corn syrup  made right here in pawnees own sweetums factory  if you cant beat em sweetums since 1891  and eight and a half dozen rubber babybottle nipples  also made here in pawnee  kernstons rubber nipples  tastes like the real thing  yes and we too are pleased to be here in your dirty alleyway  we thank you for the container of sap  and the bag of garbage  his english isnt perfect so i dont think he realizes  how insulting hes being  we are also sister cities with kaesong north korea  their town is far nicer  thats fine its my job im a diplomat  im not supposed to take it personally  we havent been here for a long time but what we have seen is  really from the bottom of our hearts truly depressing  really really sad stuff  i mean thats why people respect hillary clinton so much  cause nobody takes a punch like her  shes the strongest smartest punching bag in the world  its funny because antonio said to me  can we turn this car around and say were sick or something  or that we lost our way  of course that would be rude to you   what is your profession  im a city planner  this city was planned  on the drive in i saw a tattoo parlor  next to a school next to a taco bell  it looks like it was designed by a very stupid rodent  hes actually a pretty smart rodent  you have a quick wit  ive changed my mind i will have you for the evening  oh boy  shell get back to you on that  politically no  i dont support chavez  i despise him and everything that he does  on the other hand this is a pretty sweetass gun   the banana you wanted seor  finally  you peel  what  with your hands  you peel the banana  lets get started shall we i have a full day of activities planned  i would like to see where the children are fed the sweeteners  our restaurant  american children are fattened more efficiently  than any other children in the world  theyre like little basketballs i mean theyre huge  little porkers  this is our thermometer  im trying to turn a giant dirt pit into a community park  but i need 35000  and the city doesnt have enough money in its budget   i do not understand  youve never had a budget shortage  venezuela is blessed with massive oil reserves  massive i mean tremendous like you would not believe  the state sells the oil  keeps all the money  and we build whatever we want  now i do not understand  i feel that my english was very clear  shall i repeat venezuela  venezuela my country  has a lot of oil oil is food for cars  the venezuelans are very confident people  i know these guys didnt turn out to be exactly how we thought they would be  you said they might not know what toilet paper is  im calling an audible  we cant be humble anymore  were going to take them to our best park  and were gonna blow their socks off  i dont think thats gonna blow their socks off  well go further to chicago and pretend its part of pawnee  or new york or london  the moneys different theyll figure it out never mind  well go to the park  everybody doing okay back there comfortable  well the motel were putting you up in is really nice  you can watch tbs  do you have tbs in venezuela  i have everything in venezuela  i have four satellite dishes on my estate  we get 14000 channels   i already know who wins project runway  im coming over to your house then  i see what youre getting at  i am still primarily interested in the large black woman  here we are take it in boys   this is an embarrassment to america  im sorry   you are right to want to correct this  correct what  this is the giant pit of dirt you were telling us about is it not  the one you want to turn into a park  this is already a park and its one of our bestloved parks  why are the trees so small  theyre not that small besides size doesnt matter  yes it does  our trees are huge  we build tunnels through them            the parks in boraqua are far superior  the park in my hometown the parque del este  we have a monorail and we have an aquarium  and the jaripa amphitheatre is huge  lady gaga played there last week  great we dont have lady gaga  and i dont think shes gonna come here unless her career takes a very bad turn  but we have something more beautiful than lady gaga  democracy  im going to show you an example lets go to a townhall meeting  elvis  henry  raul butterfinger  antonio nestle crunch with the crispy rice removed  weird choice but for you  i got it done  i find it incredibly demeaning  but guess what  cash money  im going to make it rain  im gonna pick that up real quick  so are you guys ready were about to start  this is where you have your meetings  well the location rotates  sometimes we have them on the volleyball courts  where do you hold yours  well now that you asked we usually rotate as well  between different fortresses and citadels and palaces  we dont need palaces  the ideas are what shine in our meetings  what are you some kind of moron  why dont you have hand dryers in the park bathrooms  theyre so much more sanitary than paper towels anyone knows that  my dog went to one of your parks  and ate another dogs feces  and i am going to sue you for that  how do you like it  how do you like that  now imagine youre holding coffee  this is outrageous  where are the armed men who come in to take the protestors away  where  this kind of behavior is never tolerated in boraqua  you shout like that they put you in jail  right away  no trial no nothing  journalists we have a special jail for journalists  you are stealing right to jail  youre playing music too loud right to jail right away  youre driving too fast jail  slow jail  youre charging too high prices for sweaters  glasses you right to jail  you undercook fish believe it or not jail  you overcook chicken also jail  undercook overcook  you make an appointment with a dentist and you dont show up  jail right away  we have the best patients in the world  because of jail  well it was tough going but it was lively   what did you think of the open forum  this meeting of ugly people yelling  it is like torture  thats one perspective  in boraqua the government moves like a hot knife through butter  im supposed to sit here and listen to people  these fat faces turning all red  you kidding me were like kings  we walk down the street and they treat us like rock stars  we answer to nobody  in a true democracy we believe  that the input of our citizens is extremely valuable  these pretzels suck  thank you see  no wonder nothing ever gets done here  nothing gets done  tell that to the golden gate bridge or american idol  or the moon oh wait you cant cause youve never been  look this is not personal  we just think that you are weak and your city is disgusting  i think youre rude and youve been rude since you came  and i think that your medals are stupid  and your uniform is lame  and you guys want to marry hugo chavez  do not disrespect chavez  stupid chavez   i told you not to disrespect him  i did   thats twice  i dont like chavez   you do and do not disrespect him  no i dont

thank you for coming  i would just like to first say i am so sorry for blowing up yesterday  it was completely uncalled for  we are sorry as well  we were very tired from our long journey  also we were a bit jealous  our colleagues from caracas are visiting their sister city of miami  theyve been partying with dwayne wade  they sent us all these photos and quicktime files  i mean you have to see this place miami just gorgeous  theres so much soul and life  every little tiny street  so much culture and history and the cars  people take care of their cars there  i noticed that in the pictures theyre a little older but beautiful  its really nice and the food  so spicy and wonderful  we could not even believe  but pawnee is really good as well  in any case i made a few phone calls  and the government of venezuela  has authorized  a special gift  for you  35000  yes it is to fill your pit  to start to build a park  we cant take this  yes yes please  well see you later today at the photo opportunity  and i think we are good here  good meeting  maybe i should return the money  its from a foreign government i dont really trust them   im gonna return the money  are you crazy   you could buy a lowend lexus  or you could build a park  lets look at the pros and cons   pro we could fill in the pit  con maybe its dirty money  pro 35000 worth of dirty money   con not quite sure why thats a pro  pro we can fill in the pit  con ann already said that  pro and con never works  pro yes it does  i dont  fine well keep the money ok everybody happy   jerry are you happy  what did i do  meeting adjourned  can i just say i still feel kind of weird about this money  i know theyve given you a hard time  when the mayor gets here well do the photoop  theyll be out of our hair youll get to build your park  the mayor will be with us in a few minutes  we would like to take a video of you to show our superiors  sure  do you have the check  yes i do  ok you can show it to the camera  and say how much it is and what it is for  okay this is a check for 35000   and it is to build a park  how generous  yes its really generous  now say viva venezuela  viva venezuela  viva chavez  thank you venezuela   viva chavez say it  ah come on  i dont want to viva that guy  we just gave you 35000  thats worth one viva  viva chavez  yes viva chavez  what is he saying  they are very happy  they say hugo chavez will love this video  because it is another success for their committee  committee  theyre a committee to humiliate and shame america  gonna be a good video  the committee to humiliate and shame america  yes it is hugo chavezs passion project  we just had an idea  why dont you call your park after chavez  you call it hugo chavez park  you can have a nice big fountain of his head  so that when the water is coming out hes spitting at you all the time  you should write this down  viva america  viva pawnee  viva mayor walter gunderson  you have offended us  you have offended the government of boraqua  you are no longer our sister  no america is not perfect  but diplomacy isnt just  sucking up and being a pushover  sometimes you got to get tough  i am going to build that park myself  and it is going to be awesome  and its not going to have a fountain shaped like hugo chavezs head  spitting water all over everyone  unless thats what the people want  and that sir is democracy  leslie come see this  check out this video that april sent me  hey guys im at jhonnys place in venezuela  its okay i guess  he has like 5 million rooms   and this is only his guest house
