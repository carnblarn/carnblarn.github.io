are an intelligent charismatic  beautiful superhero  im making you head of public relations  which means youll be leading the daily briefing sessions  excellent idea  this is my favorite part  about having a new city manager  they always try to shake things up  and their ideas are terrible  and it brings city hall to a grinding halt  i just grab a few donuts  sit back and enjoy the show  april you are too valuable  to just be rons assistant  so from now on you are a multitasking executive aide  assisting the entire office  is this a nightmare  april wake up  tom i just wanna say  that you are a wonderful employee  and a terrific human being  meeting adjourned  tom  i enjoy you  you know what else i enjoy your entrepreneurial spirit  i did recently sell my chronicles of riddick dvd  on

because you just told me it was  five seconds ago  i got a second box of donuts if anybody  what the bleep is this  this mr director is your new desk  okay  this desk is the epitome  of the swedish concept of jamstalldhet  or equality  imagine someone needs your attention   somebody say my name  chris  swivel  what is it jerry  you told me to say your name  and you did a great job superstar  someone else say something  you look like a freak  swivel  april that is not a very good attitude  i will keep my eye on you  from my circular desk where i can see everything  tiny swivel see how it works  what about my office  and its many walls  that becomes a new public waiting room  youre gonna be more accessible than ever  the fourth floor small claims court  divorce filings stateordered

claimed your mom  was a filipino woman youd never met  should we  i was just trying to delay the inevitable  if this turns into something real  then we are gonna have to deal with chris rule  and parents and annoying flossing habits  and a lot of unfun stuff  but not yet  i just want to enjoy the bubble for a little while  im sorry  everythings good  no its not  i was completely flustered  i

pushover  very odd guy though  hes like a goofy spineless jellyfish  why do you ask sweetheart  no reason  dont worry about it its totally fine  no its not fine  what if she starts going around telling people  im a pushover  no ones gonna believe that  when i first met you  i thought you were a fascist hardass   what  a cute fascist hardass  but still you give off a very  education

and the word is perflipitusclub  because i cant fly spaceships  donna you know as well as i do  these city manager shakeups always peter out   you just have to wait  usually im with you  but this is chris traeger the six million dollar man  he wont quit  so you need to swivel your ass down to his office  and have a word with him  mommy  oh  oh that is so thoughtful of you  of course  i just figured hey  why not put my mother in a good mood  so its my understanding  that despite what i said in our meeting  you have somehow increased your request  for more school buses  excuse me  but im having coffee with my daughter  maybe we could do this another time  no were gonna talk about this now  or if youd prefer  i could put a permanent freeze on the education budget  its your call  wow maybe you should talk to him mom  he seems pretty selfassured  theres nothing left  its over  hey hey hey dont say that  now come on  get yourself together  and go out there and be the woman  you always knew you could be  thank you so much  who was that  i dont know  i saw her crying and so i helped  what did you wanna talk to me about  look chris im very flattered  you thought of me for this amazing opportunity  but i dont really know if this gig is in my wheelhouse  i tend to work best with young attractive people  tom i have made you a project leader  this is a big deal  you should keep an open mind  let your brain unlock the door to your hearts future  i made that expression up when i was 14  still in use today by me  gotta jam  you know what its just not possible  and dont even bother trying to outflank me either  because you will fail  where did all this confidence come from all of a sudden  hey guys come on lets relax   you know ms griggsknope  marlene  theres probably a compromise here  compromise is usually a sign of weakness  yes it is according to andrew carnegie  but your demands remind me of a different quote  from the great bill watterson  you need a lobotomy ill get a saw  i love calvin and hobbes  me too  i gotta say this is some of my best work  this could not have gone better  they are really hitting it off  thank god crisis averted  well i am very glad you came back up here  oh  yeah me too   yeah uh  so you have a deal  well let me mull everything over  and then we can reconnect and hash things out  it might get rough but that can be fun   ben can handle it  yup i can  okay great   it was a pleasure  oh mmhmm  whats so great is she was impressed by you too  i mean you could tell instantly that the way you guys  were connecting was really amazing  now what im thinking is that maybe  we should go over to her house  you two are just the cutest things  on four legs   aw  but why so much black  its like youre going to a funeral   shes got a point babe  so marry her then  i wish  hey sorry to interrupt the love fest  but can you hand me that folder there please ethel  oh great  why you gotta be like that ethel  looks like someone got up on the wrong side of the crib  stop laughing muriel  stop it  i gotta say im a genius  the only thing my mom loves more than music boxes  is mcsteamy from greys anatomy  so i made her  a mcsteamystyle music box  and i thought maybe you could give it to her  she would love you for it  i think maybe thats not such a good idea  why  i mean its not the best picture of him but  your mom kind of  um  made a pass at me  so websters dictionary  describes a pork as a  no its park park  im sorry geez okay so  you know what can we start over  lets lets go from the first thing i said pork  which by the way  they have a great pork sandwich in the cafeteria today   ron swanson  chris  you have come up with a plan  so spectacularly horrible  that it might ruin the entire department   now wait a minute  no i mean that  as a compliment  so it pains me to say this  my department has to go back to the way it was  give em time theyll adjust  no they wont theyre miserable  tom only performs when theres someone to impress  so marooning him on freak island  isnt helping anyone  and you made april assistant to everyone  you know who april hates  everyone  and jerry can only function if no ones looking  you shine a light on him  and he shrinks up faster than an eskimos scrotum  well thats very perceptive ron  and very graphic  i understand your point  but theres no way that i get just rolledover on this  okay  you wont ever hear me say this again  so savor this moment  i may have a compromise  look she was just flirting a little  im sure shes not really interested in me  oh my god i cant even have this conversation  the whole thing is screwed up now  theres so many ways to destroy a bubble  but my mom flirting with you is number one on the list  and im sorry i have to say this  were you asking for it in any way  no   how were you dressed  oh my god   i was wearing this  heres what we do  you issue a governmentwide memo  about sexual harassment and then you go to mexico  just for a couple of weeks  where are you going ben  ben wait just k  hey hi mom   hi again  leslie and i are dating  we havent told anyone  because theres a rule against office relationships  but its happening  im sorry we didnt tell you before you touched my knee  and i trust you wont tell anyone now  since it could get your daughter fired  that is hilarious  thats what we thought too  well  four buses   two  deal  i like this one  me too  you keep your hands off him  margarets pecan squares  they are like crack i brought you one  how are you so happy working here  i dont know man its not that bad  a year ago i lived in a pit  now i got a job and a kickass wife  and my band is so good  and are you gonna eat that pecan square  when life gives you lemons make lemonade  i read that once on a can of lemonade  i like to think that it applies to life  here you go  thank you  kind of figured youd be back in your office by now  well you know how new city managers are  seems like everyone else is back
