stressful event in a persons life  of course marriage is number seven  so watch out everyone  its all bad  we have to step up for toms sake  i think tom seems fine  well that is the problem  tom

someone had a pool table growing up huh  what do you say we play again  well make it a little more interesting go double or nothing  why not  step two  lose to your opponent intentionally so they gain confidence  step two has been completed  easily  very easily  mark is pretty good at pool  so how are you feeling tom  are you feeling okay  i like pretending to be sad  i now see why girls do it  so your arrangement with wendy  it really was completely platonic  yeah never so much as even kissed  except for a little peck at the wedding for appearances  now that youre getting divorced  i sort of feel like  there may be some potential with me and wendy  would it be okay with you if i was to ask her out  once the fake dust settles  why not sure  looking at her i i feel like  she might be the perfect spooning size for me  im gonna take a leak  that would be 6400  i accept checks and most major credit cards  mark is way better than me im gonna  im gonna say that there is at least  a chance  that i didnt think this through completely  i think im done andy  forget money well play for something else   you have nothing else to give me  a tshirt i tackled eddie vedder in  its literally priceless  okay how about this  if you win you dont owe me any money but if i win stop bugging me and ann   what are you talking about  no more comments  no more showing up when were hanging out  you leave us alone  that doesnt seem like a very fair bet  so if i win  i also get ann  okay fine  if you win then you get ann  rack em up  somebody punch someone  so how you doing buddy  want some steak champagne  think of something and well get it what do you want  a cheese fountain  a ruby  a goose heart  how about a marriage how about a nondivorce  im sorry maybe you need some time apart  to remember how much you care about each other  think about it does our marriage really make sense to you  shes a tall beautiful surgeon  im a short beautiful government employee  slash club promoter  youre a club promoter  aspiring  the point is i never meant anything to her  it wasnt even a real marriage  now the sadness is pouring out of tom  like blood from a pterodactyl after its attacked by a trex  i have to take him to a place where he cant possibly be sad  crap   we are going to the glitter factory  what  i cant go back there but if you see jasmine  tell her she can keep anthony but i want my microwave back  good youre gonna take april home  no i want to go to the glitter factory  drop out of school and start doing meth  lets go everybody  i appreciate what youre trying to do  but once you go in there  you will see things you cannot unsee  im a feminist i would never ever go to a strip club  ive gone on record that if i had to have a strippers name  it would be equality  but im willing to sacrifice all that ive worked for  just to put a smile on your perverted little face so dont blow this   all right  lap dances are on me  i mean im paying for them theyre not gonna actually be on me  got it  i kind of feel like jane goodall studying the chimps  cause there are some feminist scholars  who say that stripping is a feminist act  there is a girl here that also works at quiznos  shes really nice to me here  but really mean to me at quiznos  go put these in places i do not approve of  im gonna put these in places youve never heard of  yeah ive been a little down  totally natural im getting divorced  but now im ready to pull myself up by some gstrings  its rough in here   is it always like this  i wouldnt know  dont like strip clubs  smells like a wet mop in here  and i get the feeling that these women is running a lowgrade fever  youre one of the good ones  wait a minute  hello beautiful  strippers do nothing for me  i like a strong salt of the earth  selfpossessed woman at the top of her field  your steffi grafs your sheryl swoopes  but i will take a free breakfast buffet  any time any place  tom cat pull up a mouth  this buffet is unstoppable  im not hungry  youre doing a bangup job of looking sad about wendy  does she make scrambled eggs  take it down a notch  you already won your oscar dicaprio  ann in case i dont sink this  its been a real pleasure dating you  scratch on the eight  im victorious  im awesome at pool and i hustled your ass  take a moment to say goodbye  i dont even know how to say this i am so sorry  and i will do my best to visit you on holidays  thanks you tried  i guess youre his now   do you want to get out of here  i do  bye andy  i know that legally  ann is now mine  but it weirdly doesnt feel that way   this is seabiscuit  sierra  sorry its loud in here  and i gave her money to writhe around on your parts  i dont want to do that  well i already paid her can i get my money back  so let her do her writhing  i just got to say sierra i dont get why this cheers men up  because its very insincere and fleeting  but go crazy give my friend here the works   really grind the sorrow out of him  you got it  and then afterwards reconsider your profession but for now  grind away  stripper dancing action  i dont want to do this  is it because you have a strong positive female figure watching you  no its because im miserable  never mind thank you seabiscuit thatll be all  i dont know whats wrong with me  this is honestly the saddest ive ever been  glitter bomb  ive been to the glitter factory a million times  that girl up there  shes my emergency contact  but right now  i hate it here  and i just want to see wendy  its perfectly normal to feel devastated when somethings over  its exactly how i felt when that planet earth series ended   and then shes free to marry ron swanson  what ron  hes gonna ask her out he told me  but who cares  if its not him itll just be some other guy  did you tell tom that you were gonna ask out wendy  its complicated  what is wrong with you  i wish i wasnt alive to hear myself say this  but i am ashamed  to be your deputy i dont get men  if theyre not wagering their girlfriends in pool  then theyre trying to steal each others wives  it makes you question the whole notion of those bromance movies  great good okay  could you carry him out of here  and you know also maybe not have sex with his wife  thanks  from the knees  he weighs eight pounds  we took tom out tonight and he had a bit too much to drink  come on in  my god  you insensitive little hussy  excuse me  halt  youre not divorced yet and youre inviting other men over  youre married  technically yeah  thats my husband  whos he carrying  no thats his boss  my husbands the one thats being carried  by his boss  hows it going  good  you know what  you and ron will be perfect for each other  you should get married and start a club for people who betray tom haverford  you have a lovely home  so where do you want this  so how you feeling  rough morning  you know those hangover pills you can order on tv  i threw up a bunch of them this morning and feel much better  last night was really rough  but

from canada  wait start again  this  you guys got a second its about last night  i hope im not gonna have to explain to you that you dont own me  of course not  i never for one second thought that that was for real  you dont have to worry about me bothering you anymore  you clearly have something going  and i should respect that  if you say psych im gonna be really pissed  you remembered how much i like to say psych  but no this is no psych  thank you for saying all that just now  sure  goodbye acakes  hello ann  goodbye ann  goodbye andy  i thought for a second you were gonna chase after me but you didnt  i meant every word i said  you like your wife thats a bummer  anyone knows that you like your wife your wife knows that you like your wife  i didnt know until yesterday  so dont tell anyone dont tell ron  its my problem  how could there possibly still be glitter on me  takes forever to get off  my crotch looks like a disco ball  sorry she called you selfish of course  she just
