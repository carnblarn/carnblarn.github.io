lord really  look  when i was 18  and i became mayor of my hometown  i used every last dollar we had  to open a giant winter sports complex  called it icetown  and it turned out great and everyone loved it  uh yeah kinda  it was never completed  and i got impeached  newspaper headline was  icetown costs ice clown his town crown  yuck  they were big into rhymes  well i dont know  i think icetown sounds great  and the point is  at least you tried something  foul  foul on number three  for taking a number two on number four  roughing the passer  double dribbling thats a foul  thats a foul for touching the basketball  what are you gonna do about it  nothing you fouled  you cant do anything  okay  youre ejected youre ejected  oh whats the matter there ron  no players left  yay andys team

from the gatorade  were barely able to function  we could really use that money  but you know i dont know if its because  im in such a good mood  or because of the charming ann perkins  but i am going to seriously consider that  really thats great  mission accomplished  lets boogie  mission accomplished  uhoh  yeah  theres a mission uh that ann had thought of  it was both of our ideas  but it was mostly anns  we  i had mentioned to ann that it would be fun  if you two went on a date  so then  you could uh talk about the money  and then you know maybe give it to me  wow  ive just had my first bad date  ann perkins  not that sneaky  april  april  where have you been oh my god   hey how are you  im okay  im dying to see you  i called and texted you like a billion times  oh im sorry  i was in venezuela  oh really  wow  across the pond  wow  i thought maybe i woulda heard from you  at least once because of what happened  ann kissing me im so sorry about that  it was so stupid  and it meant nothing  i wouldnt worry about it its totally fine  hey  this is my boyfriend eduardo  no its not   listo para lonche  si  that means were going to lunch  how do you say have a great time  dont choke on anything  bye  leslie asked me to do her a favor  and i love her so i did it  im sorry and im here to eat crow  i like you a lot  lets go out again  ann perkins  budget solution number 28  use grazing sheep to mow grass in parks  note tired sheep could become food  or sweaters  well i got my answer  about april  she hates me yeah  and she got a boyfriend i guess  from some city in mexico  so  what do i do  okay  well when your backs against the wall  and odds are stacked against you  you just you  you swing the hardest damn it  you go big or you go home  and you dont seem like the kind of guy who goes home  im not  i dont even really have a home   go get her andy  okay  okay thanks leslie  okay so we know the people who run this government  have no faith in us  my plan is gonna change that  and bring the budget back  and the answers been right in front of us  the whole time  ew check your testicles  no not that  although that is very good advice  im looking at you jerry  no whats gonna save us  is right there  gentlemen i realize that times are tough  and the budget is tight  but if the people of this town have nothing else to do  but sit in their houses and play video games  then pawnee will die  and we refuse to let that happen  now  this town was historically known for two things  widespread obesity  and the annual pawnee harvest festival  people from all over indiana would come  and gaze in wonderment  at how fat our citizens were  and while they were here  they would also attend the festival  a full week of corn mazes  hayrides ferris wheels  pumpkins the size of jeeps  we lost that festival a few years ago  due to another round of budget cuts  and i propose we bring the festival back  with ticket sales and corporate sponsorship  well earn all that money back  and believe me people will come  what if they dont  well  then you eliminate the parks department  and you guys are all on board with this   aye  yes  look were not just pencil pushers  we are a reflection of the community  and we believe that we can strengthen that community  because in the end  the reason why were all here  is to bring people together    that  literally  is the most moving thing ive ever heard  and a good idea  yeah all right  excellent  great okay so everybody  were gonna party hard for 15 minutes  then were gonna have our first brainstorming session  hello april  do you like the flowers  what are you doing  all due respect eduardo  you seem like a great guy  but i like april and im coming after her  with everything ive got  so do you want to go out with me  no  i thought you were gonna say yes  but thats okay  because ill be back tomorrow to ask you again  and again the next day  and the next day  not friday  i have to go visit my cousin  but i will be back after that  to ask you again        ah you should do it  uh follow you dream  oh my god really  thats awesome  ill see you tomorrow
