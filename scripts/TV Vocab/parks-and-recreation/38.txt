well i dont know  ive been moving around so much the past few years  it might be nice to stay in one place for a while   what do you think  well this is a great city  you know its definitely the best city in indiana  probably america possibly the world  sure  but on the other hand youve put in 12 years  with the state government  so you think i should say no to chris  and head back to indianapolis
