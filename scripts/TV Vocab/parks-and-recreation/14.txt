                thank you old gus  for brightening our lives our hearts  and most importantly our shoes  this truly is a day  of mixed emotions for me  im sad that old gus is leaving  but it allows me to help andy restart his life  as pioneer halls new shoeshine guy  ive been listening to your boring speeches  for the last 50 years  and now its time for you to listen to one of mine  you know a day like this makes a man reflect upon his life  and ive come to the conclusion that ive completely wasted mine  and just for the record  i never ever liked being called old gus  i didnt understand it  when i was in my 20s and i sure hate it now  so go to hell every single one of you  screw pawnee and screw your damn shoes  old gus is classic    episode 208 ron and tammy  mpm  lestat78  so i propose that we change  our name from the subcommittee for pit beautification  to the subcommittee for lot beautification  april stop that who are you texting  you  shes texting me  sorry youre bored  hey everyone hey ann  can i talk to you  fine tom youre in charge keep the momentum going   keep these minds working  absolutely  would you rather be able to fly or speak fluent french   donna go  french  i dont wanna freak you out  but another department filed a planning claim for lot 48  who  damn it  the library  pawnees library department is the most diabolical  ruthless bunch of bureaucrats ive ever seen  theyre like a biker gang  but instead of shotguns and crystal meth  they use  political savvy  and shushing  its gonna be okay its not a done deal  youre right  thanks for pulling me out  i need a good plan  i dont want to cause a panic  news flash were screwed we got a big problem with the library  punk ass book jockeys  why do we hate the library  its the worst group of people ever assembled  theyre mean conniving rude  and well read which makes them very dangerous  and theyre trying to steal lot 48 for a new branch  what   on 48  yeah  i actually think a library would be nice that close to my house  but im not about to say that in there  a new branch  i hate them  we need to make contact with someone there  does anybody know anybody that works at the library  well we actually kind of do  the new deputy director of the department is tammy swanson  rons exwife  thats terrific or is that awful  he hates her but he knows her  everythings okay or is it just the same  youre thinking out loud again  am i i am  of course  that bitch of an exwife is working for the library now  that is perfect  the worst person in the world working at the worst place in the world  i have to go talk to her give me something i can use  does she have any weaknesses  what do you mean no everybody has one  not machines  i honestly believe that she was programmed  by someone from the future to come back and destroy all happiness  i see  just i knew that you had two exwives named tammy  so i was hoping that there was one that you got along with  i hate em both  on my death bed  my final wish is to have my exwives rushed to my side  so i can use my dying breath  to tell them both to go to hell one last time  would i get married again  absolutely  if you dont believe in love whats the point of living  im just looking forward to a thoughtful debate with tammy  about the relative merits of parks versus libraries  and in case something bad goes down i wore my sharpest rings  this one will tear you up  im leslie knope i called a little while ago  you have a lot of nerve showing your face here  excuse me  you have overdue book fees  totaling 3 dollars missy  that is so typical  i shouldve known youd use a low blow dirty pool bs move like that  thats why everybody hates the library heres your 3 dollars  see you in hell  i was just kidding dear god  you did have 3 dollars worth of fines but i cleared them  we government gals have to watch each others backs right  i know this is a trap but i dont know how  did you talk to ron  ron tends to exaggerate  when it comes to me  i swear i dont have cloven feet  sit down  shine shine shine your shoes  what do you say sir maam shoeshine  i wont look up your skirt  my gosh  crazy what are you doing its me  so ann how you been  good leslie told me you were working here now  just trying the rat race chasing the cheese racing the rats  to get the cheese  enough business talk you look ravishing   not a lot of customers  business is a little slow  it is definitely due to  the economy  ive been hearing a lot of people say that a lot about a lot of stuff  you want those shoes shined  ill give you a discount because youre a friend of anns   im more than a friend of anns  not for long   im sorry  i dont know  at least he finally has a real job  when we were dating the only job he had  was sending audition tapes to survivor and deal or no deal  hi my name is andy dwyer  and i would be a perfect contestant for deal or no deal  i want it to be a perfect park  with a state of the art  swing set and basketball courts  and off to the side a lovely sitting area  for kids with asthma to watch other kids play  if id had a park like that when i was growing up  i probably wouldnt have gone through such a prolonged mall slut phase  thats the goal  listen  you got there first  im gonna withdraw my request as a professional courtesy to you  government gals right  government gals  so you talked to tammy  whats it like to stare into the eye of satans butt hole  shes changed shes a different person  it would be healthy  for you to get a sense of closure look at mark and me  we slept together talked about it were friends  you slept with brendanawicz  tammy and i dont work  we are oil and water  or oil and tnt and c4  and a detonator and a butane torch  nothing good will come  wait  shes here isnt

did  yes donna  i got two people to put aside years of hostility  and open a door to the possibility of friendship  you were not here when they got divorced i was  those two are crazy  and you opened the gates  to crazy town  frankly i think ron was acting like a baby  a little bit  what is he afraid of  tammys just a woman  a nice woman  you know shes not a murderer  shes not a dragon  its really good to see you ron  youve aged horribly  you  son of a bitch   that didnt take long  my god whats your problem  nothings changed  who set the bed on fire  were fine  take it easy  when you meddle in

did your coffee with tammy go  leslie i cant thank you enough  for sticking your nose where it didnt belong  i knew it  so what did you guys talk about old times  i love talking about old times  new times too but theres something about old times   you know what i mean  we didnt talk  we made love  good well spare me the details   im just happy  it was so intense  i didnt know where my flesh stopped and hers began  you know what i mean  our marriage was always a complete disaster  but we did have that  the two of us  its like doing peyote and sneezing slowly  for six hours   this seems like a private matter  she knows her way around a penis  well im happy that it went well and that you enjoyed your coffee  i truly believe that everyone should be friends with their exes  i cant even tell you how many of my exes weddings ive been to  theyre reading their old divorce papers  three fistfuls of hair  thats not even possible  well im too classy to say i told you so donna  so i wrote it on a post it  why dont you take the rest of the day off  i mean you spend so much time worrying about this park  but really who cares  i care  i care a lot  its kinda my thing  but at the end of the day what does it matter  if the lot becomes a park or a museum  or a mega church  or a library  nobody said library  youve been talking to tammy about the lot  i swear on  a grave  oh my god  tell me the truth  are you giving her the lot  not giving  we have discussed a trade  for what  excuse me  more sex  tammy can i speak with you for a second  i know what youre doing you dont care about ron  youre using him to get lot 48 for your library  leslie thats crazy  and correct  why are you doing this  les there are two kinds of women in this world  there are women who work hard  and stress out about doing the right thing  and then there are women who are cool  you could either be a cleopatra  or you could be an eleanor roosevelt  id rather be cleopatra  what kind of lunatic would wanna be cleopatra  over eleanor roosevelt  havent you ever messed with a mans head  just to see what you could get him to do for you  we do it all the time in the library department  you should come join us

planning department reprioritization document   calm down i havent signed it yet  youre gonna  because tammy wants you to and you do everything that she wants  she made some really good points about libraries  are you even listening to yourself youre defending the library now  the library  of all the horrifying miserable things in the world  some people like libraries  i cant even believe it some people like libraries  ron shes in your head  you said she was a manipulative monster and you were right  tammys changed  look me in the eye and tell me that shes changed  look me in the eye  im so screwed now   her hooks are in my brain  yep  she has all the power and i have nothing  im so little  why dont you just break up with her  i dont think i can  we would just end up naked  and id give her your lot and my house  and god knows what else  i have no control over my actions   like shes crawled up inside me  god ron  i dont want to hear about your disgusting sex anymore  okay now sack up  you are ron freakin swanson  not around her im not  it took years of intense focused hatred  to get over her  and now ive undone all that great work  youve gotta help me to break up  i shouldnt get involved in this  now you dont want to get involved  its just coffee ron  shes changed ron   i let mark nail me and were still friends   i never i would never use those words  i never said point taken  lets go dump your ex  thank you  would you like to be in the room when i tell her   or would you rather wait outside  in the room  i dont want her to think im a wimp  here are the ground rules dont talk to her  do not make eye contact with her dont believe anything she says  just sit there like a potted plant  can you do that  come on  so hows the shoeshine game  im on a break  one of the many advantages of owning your own business  you know thats not your situation right  listen donna  quick question  ann is trying to decide between mark and myself  if you had to choose  who would you choose right now on the spot  im not sure why dont you spin around for me  can we talk privately   sure  just out here  so tammy for that and many other reasons  ron has decided to end this relationship  wait a minute  ron brought you here to break up with me for him  she volunteered  ron doesnt want to break up with me  what ron wants to do  is leave here right now  go to the sleaziest motel in town  and wrap himself around me like a coiled snake   no he doesnt  im pretty sure he does  see hes completely over you  look i understand  that this ann situation is awkward  but i like you a lot as a dude  and i hope that there is some way  that we can both be mature and maybe be friends  yeah i doubt it  i mean i think youre a cool dude too  i like you as well  but im still in love with ann  i couldnt have been more upfront about that  is punching allowed on the high road  im sorry leslie  she wins  i cant resist her  but you have to  stay out of this this is our relationship  hes my man and we have something twisted and beautiful  you want ron thats what this is all about  no thats insane  fine i had one dream but no no  baby dont you see whats happening here  shes manipulating you because shes jealous of me  and the things i get to do to your body and face  im here because ron is my friend  and i dont like seeing my friends miserable and you make him miserable  so ron you can give her the lot or dont whatever  just please  find a way to be happy  no wait  ron its okay just sign the thing  its not okay you just put my needs in front of your own  no woman has ever done that for me before  im sure thats not true  you see the kind of women that i choose  look just wait for me downstairs  if im not down in 5 min  its only because im receiving a pleasure so intense  what the hell are you doing  andy and anns family shoeshine  i thought it had a nice ring to it  mark has been really cool about this and youre throwing it in his face  but i still have feelings for you  i said it what do you want me to do  not mention those feelings to your boyfriend  and you might wanna take these pictures down  oh my god   take those pictures down  what its fine what did i   all of it  im gonna  now   give me the bikini one  the teeny one  bikini one   you didnt give her  lets get out of here   is part of your moustache missing  yes   walk  theres a push pin in your face  leave it in cant you walk faster  my legs are shorter than yours  we had a good run  thank you for saving my future park  it must have been hard for you  you didnt kill tammy did you  im afraid she cant be killed  to exes  may they always stay that way  tammy is  a mean person  come on you can do better than that   shes a great a bitch  there we go  every time she laughs an angel dies  even telemarketers avoid her  her birth was payback for the sins of men  but you know the worst thing about her  she works for the library  she works for the library
