                heres the situation  your parents went away on  vacation  they left the keys to the brand new porsche  would they mind  of course not  thank you thank you  just a little something i know   so whats up  someone is on fire in ramsett park  they need you to get down there right away  oh my god    episode 201 pawnee zoo   ive been spending the summer doing a lot of zoo promotions  parrots live a very long time  so we had a birthday party  for a parrot that turned 60  chimpanzees are very smart  so we had them graduate  from college  and they like to fling their feces so we hoped theyd fling their hats  but they they just flung their feces  the pawnee zoo recently purchased two south african blackfooted penguins  tux and flipper  and as part of our zoo promotion  we gonna give them a marriage ceremony  because they mate for life  tux  do you take flipper  to be your lawfully wedded wife  i do i do  by the power vested in me  from the department of parks and recreation  i now pronounce you husband and wife  okay well at least theyre married  are they making babies  no not those two those are both boy penguins  sorry  tux and flipper are both boys  so you should have pronounced them husband and husband technically  thats awesome  still you couldnt have asked for better weather  you big sandwich eater  cut it out now  just to be clear that was a friend punch  there was no flirtatious meaning  behind that playful punch i gave your arm  i do understand  youve made it abundantly clear  that theres no romantic element to our relationship in any way  good  isnt it good to be able to horse around like this as friends   it is  yeah  i really hit rock bottom that night  and i mean that i literally fell  to the bottom of a pit and hit a rock  i remember laying there thinking  theres probably a good reason why im down here  and single  and then i started thinking that i need morphine  i hear you made  two male penguins very happy today  youre making history i like that sticking your neck out  i didnt stick my neck out it was an accident  out of the mainstream thats cool   im in the mainstream  i know   not out of it  social activism  people in this town dont really like government employees being activists  last year a garbage man was suspended  for wearing a livestrong bracelet  some guy who owns a gay bar sent you a cake  pawnee has a gay bar  the bulge  its behind my house  the bulge is a gay bar  the nights ive wasted there  leslie hey girrrrrrrrl  with eight rs  thank you for supporting the gay marriage  you rock the boys at the bulge  they thought that was a political gesture  nobody eat that cake tom step into my office   thats also my office  whatever   i know that you are not gay  im not   but youre effeminate  what  youre wearing a peach shirt with a coiled snake on it   yes cause it was featured in details magazine and its awesome  effeminate anyway so the point is  do you think that marrying penguins made some kind of statement  yes the statement was that youre very lonely  and you need a pet  they sent you tshirts too  look they sent us a tshirt  mine has a collar on it  there she is  this is my boyfriend derek and this is dereks boyfriend ben  wait sorry whats the situation   what do you mean  how does this work  derek is gay but hes straight for me  but hes gay for ben and bens gay for derek  and i hate ben  its not that complicated  yeah sure  the thing about youth culture is i dont understand it   so what can i do for you guys  they just really wanted to meet you  because youre kinda like their hero now  please it was just penguins  im a public servant  and i cant take a political stance  but you did and it was awesome  none of the other politicians ever take a stand  and it means a lot to the gay community  it does and were gonna have this party tomorrow night at the bulge  and we had something to ask you  we really want you to be the guest of honor  oh my   itd be amazing if you came  yeah you have to come   who made this  we did   how  photoshop   what  computers  why are you all dolled up  its a long story  im the guest of honor at this gay bar  i guess gay men are starting to like me  i dont know they think im fabulous or something  you look good girl  you gonna turn somebody tonight  that was hands down the best interaction  ive ever had with donna  this is marcia langman  from the society for family stability foundation   hello i love your top  thank you so much  i was hoping you had a moment to discuss the events at the zoo yesterday  well i have nothing to do with this so  what can i do for you and those fine people at  the sfsf  well  you could resign if youre up for it  youre serious  when you performed a marriage for gay penguins  using taxpayer money on government property  you were symbolically taking a stand  in favor of the gay marriage agenda  im sorry but hold on a second there  marcia that was not my intention at all  why else would you marry penguins  because i firmly believed that it would be cute  and it was  are you married  not yet marcia  soon probably  i have a plan but not no not now  not dating anyone yet focusing on my career but  i thought so  so you couldnt possibly understand  but when gays marry  it ruins marriage for the rest of us  so either you annul the wedding  or ill publicly ask for your resignation  you know what  im terrible with directions if im heading to the parking   do i make a left or i go right  left   youre welcome  annul the wedding  im supposed to meet leslie for lunch  but she actually works so  mark was brought to my hospital the night of the accident  he was here for a week  i think when his head hit the ground  it mustve knocked something loose  because hes actually a pretty nice guy now  and andy after we broke up  he told me he was going to kansas  to climb mountains  so i dont i dont really know where he is  have you seen that documentary about food yet  no i havent but i heard its really good i want to see it  we should go together  what  i dont i dont think so  that would be like a date  say no more  i hate salad  i dont want to ever keep secrets from you  me neither  lets invent our own secret language that only we understand  and then we can use it around people and no one will know what weresaying  but in the meantime im just gonna tell you in english  mark kind of asked me out  he weirdly asked me  to go see a movie with him  and i said no of course  but i just  i just wanted to let you know  im feeling a lot of confusing things right now  no of course you are  and your friendship is the most important thing to me  and hes offlimits  thank you  i was really serious about that secret language  i know  i cant believe this is a gay bar  especially with that heterosexual cowboy greeting us on the way in  where should i drink now  theres a bar called pitchers and catchers you can go there  heres the plan  our position is we have no position  so lets say thank you for the party  but we regretfully decline your offer to honor me  i cant believe you came   its leslie knope  leslie knope youre my hero  nice   you are looking hot  really  thank you ben  im really enjoying this hug  its so nice but i need to tell you something   this one is on us  well if its free  shes leslie knope and she wants to recruit you  oh my okay please  gentlemen first of all  i would like to say thank you so much for throwing me this party  especially on a night when the colts are playing  we love you leslie  this is green  i wanted to tell you that i wasnt really trying to take a stand  when i married those  penguins  youre chanting my name  i just have one thing to say  together we can change pawnee forever  lets dance

gay  im having such a nice time  ive met many interesting people  and theres two bisexual guys here  and i got both of their phone numbers  all morning  have fun last night  i had three drinks named after me so thats pretty fun  plus ben and derek are taking me shopping on saturday  and were gonna find out my actual bra size  i guess im kind of like queen of the gays  bully for you  i just got a phone call they want you to go on pawnee today  thats huge whats the topic  that marcia from the family thing is calling for your resignation  you gotta go on and defend yourself  why i havent even officially taken a stand on gay marriage  thats funny somebody just told me you were queen of the gays  that was me  pawnee today with joan callamezzo  its kind of like the meet the press of our town  its the big time  i know it is im nervous  i just wish i was here under different circumstances  guess who  megan fox one of the desperate housewives  joan callamezzo  whats up good to see you  tom comes all the time joan loves him  you have the softest skin of any woman in pawnee  i wish you could reach  from your tv screen and just touch joans skin for a second  thats sweet youre pretty soft yourself   how are your kids doing  theyre pretty good  is it tough for them to have a mother that is so beautiful  whats it like being the most attractive   keep up those funnies ill have to invite you over for supper  ill have to come over for supper  you well seem  my god  ann perkins how you doing  im good how was mountain climbing  what  can i come in i wanted to talk to you for a second  sure  we have a controversial topic today  the gay penguin marriage at the pawnee zoo  so marcia what is all the fuss about  the fuss is that miss knope  claimed that she was not advocating for this gay cause  and then that very night  she was the guest of honor at a progay marriage rally  at a bar called the bulge  how do you respond  id first like to say that i wasnt trying to advocate for anyone  i did not know that both of the penguins were males  and i was just trying to perform a cute fun ceremony  to promote our local zoo  i have to say that  that stunt that you did with the penguins  was clearly over the line  what if anything can miss knope do  to make it right   we dont want to be unreasonable  of course not  we think that she should separate the penguins  annul the marriage  reimburse the taxpayers  for the cost of the wedding of course  and then resign  is that it   that would do it  anything else  want me to jump off a building perform harry caray  move to a different town no i kid  full of ideas today  this is the reason why people dont go into politics  because i bust my ass  for the people in this city and i cant win  i have one night of fun  with some of the best dancers ive ever danced with  and suddenly everybodys freaking out  look at that were lighting up here  good great lets go for it bring it on  how does this work   there you press that one  youre on the air  i think that lady should resign  good thank you next caller  you should resign and repay your salary  two for resign  thank you next caller  i just want to say that i love the zoo and the zoo is really fun  thank you thats really sweet  and i think you should resign  you look great you look amazing  thanks you look fancy  yeah the monkey suit  it cost 3000 bucks but totally worth it  i sold out  i got a boring office job in town so i gotta dress up  you know the grind  but im really happy and i really feel like ive matured  a lot  good thats  im happy for you  i was sitting in the cubicle the other day  doing some thinking  some growing   and some maturing  yes maturing  darn it if i dont just miss you  and acakes just let me  i love you and  im sorry for the way i treated you i was the worst boyfriend ever  i know that and i  i think it would behoove us to give it another shot  yeah look  im really happy for you about your job  and that youve learned some new words  but im sure about my decision  ok say no more  listen hit me up on my cell phone  ill be around  and if you wanna talk or grab coffee   or something like that ok  ok  gotta get back to the office   have a good one good seeing you  bye  the hardest part about living in this pit  its probably keeping my suit pressed  and the rats  its like a freakin rat parade every night  i just want to be close to her house because i need to protect her  cause there are some weird people that live around here  if you let penguins get married where does it end  i mean would you let me marry my guinea pig  because i want to marry my guinea pig ill take my answer off the air   thats a valuable point  attendance is up 30 at the zoo  youre welcome  and that penguin wedding was cute and im not gonna annul it  id ask you to reconsider  well id ask you to stop asking me  because its not gonna happen marcia   is that right  last time i checked i dont think  i murdered anyone  or had an affair or did drugs  but i apologize  i apologize for having fun and for making something cute   where are you from originally  what did i do   so you will not be annulling  no i will not be annulling  look at them  theyre just in their own little  penguin love bubble  thats what its like  when you meet your mate and know youre gonna be together  you know what i realized were just animals  we dont know anything about love  you should go with mark  really i thought about it  look he might not be my gay penguin but he could be yours  look i told you im not going on a date with him  if you dont wanna go out with him dont but dont do it because of me  im fine with it  all thats important is were friends   me too  good great  plus i already called and told him that you were dying to go out have fun  so i transferred the penguins to a zoo in iowa  gay marriage is legal there so hopefully theyll be happy  at least theyll be together  look six flags i should take them on a water slide  they might die but it would be so cute
