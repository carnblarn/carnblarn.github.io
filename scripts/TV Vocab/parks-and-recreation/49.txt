you and the goddesses wanted five years ago  in a sense but its a little bit more complicated than  wasnt your answer the very same thing  that the ranger council said to you  stick to your own kind  who wants homemade peanut brittle  miss perkins please were in the middle of a debate  sorry  come on goddesses we just struck a huge blow for equality  by proving that we were better than them  i disagree lauren what about a public forum  you always say that theres no better solution for a hotbutton issue  than a good oldfashioned public forum  great idea lauren what was that  i said great idea lauren  ive taught them too well  ive created a mob of little leslie knope monsters  im so proud and a little annoyed but mostly proud   just relax and dont move  this is the most stressed out

waste of time thank you  powerful stuff okay lets open up the floor to debate  who yes abigail  isnt it like brown versus the board of education  separate but equal is never really equal  we should
