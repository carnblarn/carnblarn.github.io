well the people in this room are your methadone  and were here to get you clean  congratulations  holy matrimony theres the man of the hour  jerry what is this  that is the set of tumblers  that i got from the registry  this is an intervention  i thought you said on the phone  it was a reception  okay all right lets begin  i would like to address the goofylooking  dirtykimonowearing cornrowed clown in the room  if you see ron swanson can you give him this message  you used to be a man  you need to get your house in order  look i love you like a brother  but right now i hate you  like my actual

see why chris stood me up for lunch  but i think i just figured it out  because he doesnt like you  no im pretty sure thats not it  actually its because i didnt call you deliberately  which if you ask me is a fireable offense  so i would tell him that  also hes not into you sexually   mmm  ann perkins  april ludgate  literally two of my favorite people on earth  im sorry that i had to cancel lunch  not at all its not a problem  april here was very apologetic on the phone  she also sent me flowers  april nice touch  hello ron its ron  if youre watching this it means that once again  you have danced with the devil  right now youre probably thinking  tammys changed  well be happy together  but youre only thinking that  because shes a monstrous parasite  who entered through your privates  and lodged herself in your brain  so you have two choices  one get rid of tammy  or two lobotomy and castration  choose wisely  you stupid  this is a waste of time  you people have no idea what youre talking about  that was you on the tape that was you talking  ron ron  ron oh there you are  ah  ron stop it god please   ron dont do that  oh its done leslie  tammy and i are in love  and were gonna

can pick up your vitamins and supplements  everybody starts somewhere  youll travel  and you will meet interesting people  think about it  okay i will  apparently he wants april  to move to indianapolis with him  so thats something  i hope youre happy  look i just wanted to show him what it felt like  to have your exwife date someone you know  whatever happened after that is not my fault  yes it is  tom you did a really crappy thing  and i think deep down you know that  whatever happens to ron swanson is on you  excuse me chief sorry to interrupt  hey calzone boy whats up  well heres hoping that that nickname doesnt stick  right  but thats not why im here  uh leslie knope asked you for a favor the other day  but the real favor we need is much bigger  you mean like calzonesized  ah sure  we need the pawnee police force  to volunteer as security  during the upcoming harvest festival  now the city wont let us throw the festival unless  say no more  just send me a schedule of how many officers you need and when  really just like that  leslie knope gets as many favors as she needs  can i ask why  because shes the kind of a person  who uses favors to help other people  and also
