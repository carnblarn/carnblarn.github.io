and mortenson had to fill in for howser  okay well why couldnt donna do it  because donnas reading jerrys italian poem  this is sort of a mess   no its okay were  what the hell leslie  i thought i was supposed to lay the ceremonial wreath  why is councilman howser doing it  because you are doing  something better  you are lighting the memorial flame  which is the greatest honor of all  oh my god ron congratulations  i saved it for you ron  who caught you guys  a very nosy maintenance worker  and we talked to him and now were all friends  and hes not gonna tell on us  its totally fine  i think if you would know  one thing about me  it would be that i prefer laying wreaths  to lighting torches  i have cried twice in my life  once when i was seven  and i was hit by a school bus  and then again when i heard  that lil sebastian had passed  his memory will live on  hup and  as today we light a fire  that will burn on for eternity  okay deep breath  i think we got through it   thank god  yeah  hey jerry you put propane  in the eternal flame right  no they were out  so i just got a big thing of lighter fluid  its kind of the same thing  oh  huh ho  we planned that  wow wow  ohhhh   we planned that  yea  wow  jeez ron i am very sorry  i  i guess i put too much fuel in the torch  oh i dont know jerry  i think youre being hard on yourself  are you mad at me  cause without eyebrows i cant really tell  ron swanson loves his facial hair  and we burned it off  this thing that were doing  its unsustainable  what you want to break up  what no i like you  well then you want to tell chris  what no i like my job  well then what do we do  okay operation shutdown  no more secret handholding  no more smooching in anns office  in fact when were at work  we just shouldnt talk to each other at all  okay well thats gonna be really hard  and we could still get fired  i know  but its worth the risk  if i can be with you  all right  well then im in  what are you doing are you kidding me  im sorry no its force of habit  so what do i do huh  do i stay here or roll the dice  with jeanralphio  you have no interest in government work  and you slow everything down with your selfish attitude  id love for you to stick around tommy  itll be damn hard to replace you  but ill support you either way  two of my lovers in one place  what a coincidence  tammy  hello ron  oop what happened here  and more importantly  does the carpet match the face  if youre looking for trouble take it somewhere else  an hour ago a giant fireball  consumed my entire face  and it was far preferable  to spending another second with you  hm  tell that to your pants tent  its just the way im standing  go back to the library  where you belong  hey glenn  wanna dance  no im okay  just one dance   no  with mommy  you see ive been through the desert   on a horse with no name   you know tendonitis is uh  usually caused by overuse  have you been working out more than usual  i did do 10000 pushups last week  oh really  that might have something to do with it  you need to relax youre in great shape  for a 44yearold  yeah thats how old you are man  youre right ive been overreacting  i dont like thinking about death  death is the opposite of  being alive  exactly  look at us  talking like friends  yeah  what the hell friends  ann perkins  chris traeger  whats the point in doing 10000 pushups  if youre gonna do them alone  id much rather do  with a wonderful woman  sitting on my back to increase my resistance  copy of our new hit single  5000 candles in the wind  and the new fulllength cd the awesome album   i dont know thats thats a lot of money  no it isnt  okay  honey you are awesome at this  thanks  april i need to ask you something  and its the biggest thing ive ever asked anybody  in my entire life  honey were already married  no this is way more important than that  april ludgate  would you be my manager  seriously  okay  yeah  if you cannot ride a ghost   byebye   lil sebastian   excuse me  are you leslie knope  yes  my name is william barnes  do you have a minute to talk  sure  we really enjoyed the service  that fireball was truly amazing  im glad cause it was planned  and you were also responsible  for the harvest festival correct  well a lot of people contributed to that  you dont have to be modest  we know it was you  you did an amazing job  thank you  we are part of a group that tries to identify  potential candidates for political office  here in town  and we think that you might fit the bill  oh  wow  which office in particular  well there are a couple city council seats  we think are vulnerable  mmhmm  and the mayors term is up next year  uh um huh  all we need to know right now is  are you theoretically interested in running for office  absotootly i am  very sorry that i just used that word  but yes  i just  ive dreamed about this moment for a long time  guess ill be heading home  catching the number 12 bus to satans butthole  actually i prefer the number 69 train  to humpsville station  red alert swanson  your exwife is back  no kidding donna  not her  the other exwife  tammy one  shes in your office  oh bleep  so much better than one   would i have to quit my job  look thats a long way off   of course  but listen  when you run even in a local election  your life becomes an open book  so if you so much as stiff a waiter on his tip  or use a government stamp for personal mail  it will come out  so before we go any further  i need you to tell me  is there a scandal out there  is there anything at all you need to tell us  about your life  nope  all right  well well be in touch  no no   yeah he burned in so little time   and things i really want to do    yeah i think we can do that for a million  okay well talk
