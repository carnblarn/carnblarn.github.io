remote village in brazil  this sounds good  they take a little bit of scorpion poison  and they serve it to you  i wonder who that is   who could that be  more people  a belly dancer  what  its weird but  she just showed up  im not the kind of person thats gonna throw  someone out or you know  not let them in  if they randomly show up  i dont know how they all got here  you know people hear about a killer party at knopes house  at knopes house they all come arunnin  you dont do origami every day do you  they brought in a little entertainment thank god  cause that justin is so boring  what are you talking about hes incredible  yeah hes not gay  but if he were i would totally break up with ben for him  yeah i would understand   hes amazing right april  right april  dont we love him  yeah hes actually kind of awesome  youre underage  i could lose my liquor license im sorry  are you having fun  all i can say is this is not  not what i was expecting   i cannot believe theres more  theres not  miss knope  i understand that youre currently evaluating the rec center teachers  youre doing what  i demand an evaluation  what course do you teach  when it comes to choosing accounting software  theres no accounting for taste  the advantage of quickbooks pro  is that its easy to assemble a list of vendors  well this is great  im heading home  so as not to have to be here anymore  my office first thing tomorrow  yeah i think were probably gonna take off too  the demonstration takes another 45 minutes  yeah guys please everybody can you just stay okay  justin would you  i promise you miss knope this disciplinary committee will go over  every detail of what happened last night  and we will determine whether you are guilty of abusing your power  do you have anything to say before we begin  just that im looking forward  to the truth coming out  i would like to say that leslie  is incapable of using people for her own gain  but i cant because  leslie loves using people for her own gain  if i may phil id like to say something to tom on the record  this has all been on the record  im very sorry that i invited wendy to the party   is wendy one of the teachers  no shes my soontobe exwife  and hopefully thentobe future wife  look im really sorry  i put a new romance in front of an old friendship  i put a beautiful man  in front of an adorable man child  youre ruining it  i put a big white stallion  in front of a little brown pony  totally uncalled for  ron swanson will be next  when it comes to government hearings  the only type of witness i enjoy being  is a hostile one  thats why i intend to answer  every one of their questions with a question  were you aware that all of the entertainment and food  was provided by teachers  would i have stayed if i knew that   i dont know would you have  would you have  no i wouldnt have  did you hear leslie make any promises  what constitutes a promise  a quid pro quo  do you know latin  are we done  can i get a shine  no im sorry were closed  due to betrayment  im sorry but i dont know what youre talking about  why dont you ask your new best friend   whose name is justin  justin  i would  but hes probably too busy  cleaning gum out of his coat pockets  unbetrayed  so you dont work for the government  and you had no idea that these people  were teachers from the local rec center  i was simply attending a dinner party at my friends house   why is he here ms knope  that will become clear  mr anderson could you please describe that evening  well i had a very pleasant time  and from my perspective there was no abuse of power  with respect to ms knope and any of her various guests  could you define pleasant  did you have a good time did you have a great time  be specific and do you remember that youre under oath  i had an amazing time  but you fell asleep  god im so sorry no look i you know  id been given a case the night before so i had to stay up all night working   i didnt want to cancel  you should have told me  are you kidding me i had an awesome time  which had nothing to do with the rec center teachers  no further questions  were gonna take a break  and well let you know what we decide in about an hour  great  i will see you later  im in the middle of official business so i cant talk   but yes you will  great  so did you get that he said amazing and awesome  so im gonna drive up and see him next weekend  theres some kabuki theater festival happening  great youre so relaxed  youre not freaking out at all  weve reached our decision  were not going to take any further action at this time  it really helped that you asked for this hearing yourself  and that you made financial restitution out of your own pocket  but i think we both know you skirted a line here  you turned yourself in why  well i did something wrong and i felt bad  so this morning i donated 1000 to the rec center  so everybody could keep teaching their classes   so why did you ask for the hearing  are you kidding ann  its every girls dream to ask a dude  how their date went under penalty of perjury  im not proud of my actions  but the most important thing is there is an official government document  that proves my dinner party kicked ass  tommy hav   jtrain  whats up buddy  this might be none of my business but  you need to ask wendy out  for reals this time  did leslie tell you  she didnt need to  i saw it  im not gay  but youre the most incredible man ive ever met  that doesnt sound gay at all  see you later   take care  bye brother  you sure you dont wanna come hang out for a minute
