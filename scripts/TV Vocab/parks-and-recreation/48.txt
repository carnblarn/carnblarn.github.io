but then my campaign advisors said  we should make it a big wide release  so we had people contribute and we added pictures  and we removed a lot of my poems  and emotional ramblings and pictures of unicorns  and here it is  leslie could one say  that a book is nothing more than a painting of words  which are the notes on the tapestry  of the greatest film ever sculpted  one could say that  but should one  join us next week when david bianculli  will be filling in for richard changjefferson  who will be filling in for me  leslie would you like to take us out  okay  please enjoy a song from

your show  nope  im trying to find the words to describe this girl  without being disrespectful  getting the book into joans book club will really help leslie  but it will also help my company entertainment 720  at the risk of bragging  one of the things im best at is riding coattails  behind every successful man is me  smiling and taking partial credit  now about leslies book am i going to be happy  well see wont we hmm  wow you guys are really cute together  ben im cute together with everybody  anyone find any mistakes  yeah actually in here it says that pawnee is great  but in reality

was born in pawnee id stake my reputation on it  i have to tell you this feels like gotcha journalism  in what way  that way you put gotcha on my face  after the break  where was leslie knope  actually born pawnee  we will pull out the world map and speculate wildly  oh god not the gotcha dancers  that was despicable i am horrified at her tactics  that said the show was very lively  joan

married woman  she wants what she cant have its a game of cat and mouse  thank you all for coming  our journey begins on page one the preface  oh boy yes  i think i speak on behalf of everyone  in the entire world when i say  we need to know the truth about where you were born  okay well  leslie let me handle this  does it really matter  i mean how many of you were actually born in pawnee  fair enough  no matter what you heard maam the truth is i was born here  if you were so born here then wheres your birth certificate  well i dont carry my birth certificate around with me  why because youre hiding something  you should go back where you came from  i am back from where i came from  that sentence was confusing you might as well be from china  thats ridiculous is it  im from here  this crowd is getting very hostile ms knope  im going to get you out of here  oh my god back off  bye everybody  when i was 18  val kilmer saw me at a mall and told me i should model  that never happened  so joan how is married life treating you  your husband still know hes the luckiest man in the world  santino and i are divorcing oh  its actually quite liberating  im a woman with a strong sexual appetite  im like a caged peacock yearning for the wind on her haunches  thats a powerful metaphor  maybe we can get that book club sticker in order  and we can work on unlocking that peacock cage  things have changed tom dont make any promises you cant keep  ill have another drink  and so will this adorable hunk of caramel to my right  drink up tom im going to go powder my nose  amongst other things  if you know what i mean  crap  is she going to powder her vagina  youve got to help me man  why seems to be going the usual amount of gross  no this is way different shes not married anymore  she had like five bottles of alcohol shes calling me caramel  youve got to throw some cold water on the situation  start talking about nerd stuff  you know nerd culture is mainstream now  so

indiana  im from eagleton  is it true mom was i born in eagleton  yes its true  no  pawnee hospital was overrun with raccoons at the time  so we had to go to the next closest hospital  no  im sorry did you expect me to give birth to you  in an infested diseasefilled room  mom why didnt you tell me  you try telling that little girl shes not from pawnee  i certainly couldnt  so you were technically born in eagleton who cares  i care  the people of pawnee care  i wrote on the cover of my book that i was born in pawnee  i went on pawnee today and i called joan a liar  im the liar im worse than a liar  im an  eagletonian  good morning ls leslie here  oh man i am so tired i took a halfshift at the hospital last night  and i had this really weird patient  weird how  i probably shouldnt talk about it  its one of the grossest things ive ever seen  talk  well this guy came in he got his hand stuck in a pringles can  and he tried to cut himself out  was there a lot of blood what kind of blade did he use  three and a half inch  serrated buckets of blood  he passed out over his arm and slumped onto the floor  did the bone show  very good question april answer her  yeah the bone showed  everyone in the universe loves a gross medical story  boom l win  and so when i finally cleaned up the vomit i found the toe  i forgot about the toe so did we  crazy right  that storys awesome  indeed thank you for sharing jenny  ann was getting a little chummy  when people get too chummy with me  i like to call them by the wrong name  to let them know i dont really care about them  thats a genius move  thank you  youre welcome lester  oh my god i wonder who else was born in eagleton  voldemort probably  bad news team  entertainment 720 was unable to get the sticker for leslies book  the sticker is the least of my problems  if i come clean about where im from  then my political career is over  you dont have to tell them a damned thing  the only thing the voters need to know about you is your name  and even that i go back and forth on  im sorry but i disagree  leslie where you were born is a piece of trivia  where youre from  thats what makes you who you are and you are from pawnee  youre more pawnee than anyone i know  so i say tell them the truth  and trust that theyre going to respect you for it  damn it hes right well said  thanks ron  youre welcome steve  joan  thanks so much for having leslie back on the program  well thank you for getting me home last night  i wasnt feeling very well  because of some bad seafood that i ate  yes thats probably what it was  id like to apologize to those that ive misled  i thought i was telling the truth  but sadly i was born in eagleton  well that is worse than i ever could have hoped for  i learned something joan its not where youre born  its where youre from  when i was nine years old i broke my arm  sledding on that giant hill behind kernstons rubber nipple factory  you know nipple hill of course  it gets very slippery there i know that  especially when its wet yes  and jim jim kabernick i know jim  jim and i have gone to school together  since we were like three years old  yes thats true  do you remember when you peed your pants in second grade  why did you bring that up i said yes  you stuck your underwear in your drawer and you got real embarrassed  and then the teacher came over and pulled them out  and everybody called you the gerbil  because you always smelled like soiled wood chips  leslie for gods sake were on tv  the point is you cant choose where you were born  but you can choose where you live  i love this town i always have  i always will  and thats why i wrote a book about it  and thats why im running for city council  look im not crazy  i know pawnee isnt paris or london or chicago  but its a great place to live and work  and serving the goofballs in this town is an honor and a privilege  and yes every town claims its diners waffles are the best in the world  but somewhere in some town there really are the best waffles in the world  so delicious and rich and golden brown  that anyone who tasted them would decide never to leave that town  somewhere those waffles exist  why cant it be here  joan put us in her book club  although i could do without this  leslie heres the thing ive been all over the state  indianapolis bloomington lafayette muncie gary  all the places you mention in the book  and ive interviewed all the people you mentioned  and so far there is not one incorrect fact  so now i am going to head to the house say hey to gayle  wish my daughter a happy belated birthday it was yesterday  and then im going to head back out  and hit all the towns in the southeast  but is there anything i should know any new info  nope  youre doing great godspeed  doing what i can yep  got to go donna cant talk  he just seems so happy  i didnt say anything
