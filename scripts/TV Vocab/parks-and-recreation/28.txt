with the local cable access station  to raise money for diabetes research  and its important because pawnee  is the fourth fattest town in the us  goes us  dallas tulsa  and certain parts of the mall of america  well this year i get to program my own fourhour block  i know exciting  so ive signed you all up for multiple shifts  just to answer phones and provide moral support   from when to when

nutriyum bars leslie  i know theyre terrible  but they give me an insane 15 minute burst  plus my nana used to tell me youll sleep when youre dead  she used to say the best stuff  dont work yourself
