                1 gee wheeze the harvest festival was a real triumph  we had over 80000 people in attendance  which surpassed our wildest expectations  i would like to specifically single out leslie knope  i speak for the mayor city council  and all of pawnee when i say  we cant wait to see what the heck  youre gonna do next  ugh  step on up here les  thank you  paul are you okay  uh  oh oh   oh my god  holy  oh my god  that was the second most awkward way  a man has ever grabbed my breast   all right guys everybody listen up  just a few notes about our camping retreat tomorrow  were all gonna meet here and leave as a group  at 645 am promptly  why are we doing this  harvest fest is over  we do not want to have a sophomore slump  this camping trip is our chance  to think of some really big ideas  why dont you just tell us what our next project is  and ill go camping by myself  look i have ideas ron okay  i have like a hundred new ideas  but the point is the pressure is on  we only have one chance to make a second impression  what portion of this camping trip will take place outside   all of it  pass  cant pass its a mandatory work retreat  i have a question  what if were scaling a cliff  and i start to fall  can i grab onto your boob for support  no tom dont her boob kills  my boob does not kill paul did not die  he had a heart attack which required an octuple bypass  besides the pawnee sun said that my chest  saved his life  hows the best municipal department in pawnee  thats you guys  paul is going to be recuperating for a while  so the mayor asked me to step in as city manager  and i of course accepted immediately  because pawnee is literally  the greatest town in the country  of course i am gonna miss indianapolis  which is the most wonderful city in america  im so excited to be working with you all again  and leslie i cannot wait  to hear your new big idea  i want to hit the ground running  and your new mystery project  is going to be the hydration pack  that gets me to the finish line  youre all my little hydration packs  im sure i am not  ron  you are too  hydration pack  hey you gotta hear this hilarious story  that hes telling me tell her what happened   my identity was stolen  his identity was stolen  tell her about the accounts  they were frozen  frozen  bye kyle  where you going  oh my god  heh hows the coolest chick ever  not good  what do you mean  leslies making us go on a camping retreat  thats awesome campings the best  camping sucks  its superboring  and you can see the stars which i hate  theyre creepy  i love

ann  what do you think  we should get together soon means  no do not read into this  remember this is the guy that was so upbeat and positive  when he broke up with you  you didnt even know it happened  yeah  come camping with us  itll be really fun youll be away from chris  you can brainstorm  ill give you first dibs on smores  okay that sounds fun  here is our official retreat schedule  it divides our time evenly  between work and play  come on everybody lets hustle  lets get to the brainstorming  great attitude ron  i just wanna get the work over as soon as possible  so i can do some fishing  fishing relaxes me  its like yoga  except i still get to kill something  all right i  call this wonderful spot  you didnt bring a tent  i dont really go camping ever jerry  so im not gonna spend 150 on a tent  just gonna sleep on the floor  its called the ground when its outside  whatever why  do you guys do this a lot camping  ive never been before but i think im gonna love it  why am i gonna love it  skymall  come check out my tent  i ordered a bunch of crap off skymall  i got my tv my xbox dvd  awesome bed right there  dj rumbas in the mix  ah its like im not even camping  this is actually a dog couch but its super comfortable  its really important to me that april loves camping  so i went ahead and set up the ultimate  campsite love nest  complete with beautiful starlight  you got champagne  also rose petals  as you can see they smell terrific  we need big ideas and we need em now  who wants to go first  i propose that we take all the money we made  from the harvest festival  and return it to the citizens  so how much would that be per person  about 83 cents  per household  before postage  are we done  what do jayz lil wayne  and drake all have in common  oh i know this one  they are all rappists  oh my god theyre rappers jerry  what they have in common is none of them  have ever performed in pawnee  why  because we dont have  an adequate concert venue  until now  the pawnee amphitheater  how much would that cost  not that much 200 300 million   right  great  luxury dog park  do you wanna tell us anymore  poodles only  no pooping  hey where are you  im here where are you  were inside the main entrance  near the sign that says pawnee campground  oh  im in a totally different place  thats why we cant see each other  my god andy  i dont even want to be here  the air is too fresh  its disgusting i cant breathe  theres a brook somewhere that wont stop babbling  shut up  sweetheart just hold tight  and uh ill be there  well april is right here  and iam down here somewhere  how bout we just invest the money  make 4 a year  you know set up a nice little nest egg for the city  what do you think  great idea thanks white urkel  all right maybe its not the sexiest idea todd  but its smart  what are you even still doing here  harvest festival is over  shouldnt you be back in indianapolis  ben helped us launch the harvest festival  and he knows how chriss mind works  and hes a valuable asset to the team  thank you  april has not presented her idea april  i didnt come up with anything   why  because  i know that whatever we come up with  isnt gonna be good enough anyway  were just gonna go with your idea  shes got a point  leslie just tell us what your idea is  so i can go back to the thunderdome  thats what im calling my tent  i am really disappointed in all of you  you know the whole town is looking at us right now  and youre letting them down  take an hour go clear your heads  and see if you can come up with a real idea that we can use  and also see if youre interested  in contributing to this department  and after that i will tell you my idea  wow you really let em have it  well i had no choice  i didnt want to tell them my idea  why not  because i dont have one  i dont have an idea ann  im so screwed ann  the meeting is tomorrow and i dont have anything  why dont you build the park on the lot behind my house  chris wants the new project to generate revenue  what about those binders in your office  theyre filled with small ideas  we need a big juicy idea  im so desperate i even brought in my dream journal  hoping it would inspire me  i married alf and were pretty happy   sounds nice  it was  okay listen to me  you are smart and creative  and talented and youre gonna be fine  youre probably right  i just need an hour and and itll come to me  hello  andy you have to save me  im camping with people i work with  hello april  hello  walk around in circles like i am  help triangulate the phone call  hello  hang on im gonna try to get to higher ground  agh  ow i found some thorns  i mean yes my daughter might think  she is old enough to be sexually active with her boyfriend  but im sorry 16  that that just seems too young to be on birth control  you know i was 24 when gayle took my virginity  whats say we just stand here  in silence  and think of ideas  for projects  you know what i should do  i should lead a teen abstinence workshop  that might be incredibly effective  hey tom  one second im just in the middle of a head massage  thats a good stopping point   whats up  uh  you wanna bounce some ideas off each other  heres a better idea  how bout i bounce my way over to my dog couch  and watch a little season six of top chef   all right  i know leslie seems upset  but the truth is shes better than us at this stuff  by a thousand miles  so theres really no point  care for some fondue  yeah  hey how do you afford all this stuff  i just return it the next day  and claim it was defective  the key is crying a lot  no one likes to hear a grown man cry  and then my hand accidentally  went in the panini press  hey you wanna go for a walk  yeah  wow the sky is really beautiful  its pollution from the sweetums factory  its gorgeous  but is it worth the asthma  no  ben this new project idea  its not really a big deal  im probably making too much out of it  no no no its really big  i mean youve got everyones attention  with the harvest festival  and now youre gonna seal the deal  its the chance youve been waiting for  well what if the festival was like a high point for me  and i never do anything better than that  then you wouldnt be leslie knope  so i have to keep thinking about good ideas  all the time or im no longer myself  no no no not at all  i ive just honestly never met someone  who works as hard as you do  i mean youre like the energizer bunny  of city government  and when she looked in the back of her car  she saw that even though it was her own private property  she would be forced to take it in  for a state inspection  okay guys listen up   what was that  that was me talking  no i heard it too  andy  if thats a coyote  someone needs to pick me up off the ground now  oh my god oh oh   hey guys  what are you doing here  i was just out for my nighttime run  and i thought why not go visit the parks department  hows everything going here  super great really well  we have a great idea  ooh tell me now  while i sit on this boulder  im much more receptive to new ideas  when my heart rate is still elevated  chris do you want to maybe just talk for a minute  and let them work  oh oh sure  what was that what was that  leslie just tell us your idea  los angeles season one isnt gonna watch itself  here it is  what do you think  i dont have an idea im sorry  i thought if we all worked really hard  ii could come up with something  but i dont have anything  and were totally screwed  and what we need to do  is just keep working and just work again more  and just do it and get it  and then we got it and were good  and go with that  i think im gonna turn in  youre not going anywhere no ones going anywhere  no ones sleeping  because this is an allnighter  and thatll be fun  well all stay up and then ill be like  hey no one sleep  do you hear how loud that is  youre not sleeping through that  is there anything else to eat  the marshmallows are all gone  we have nothing to eat  jerry scared all the fish away  with his loud personal stories  uck i wanna go home  i miss my canopy bed  yeah im fine with not camping  especially since my stupid boyfriend abandoned me  ill fire up the van  you know ive never moved this slowly before  its almost like being in quicksand  hey um listen  when you dumped me  it was really embarrassing  you just kind of took off  oh im so sorry  i mean i never meant to hurt you  and well um im back now  hey i have a great idea  why dont we go to this rustic diner that i know  we can have egg white omelets  and we can continue to talk about us  sounds good  no no  chocolate or butterscotch  uh swirl me  dude camping is awesome  i love it  excuse me gentlemen  how long have you been running power to this tent  i dont know how long have we been here  ten hours  no i was tivoing cupcake wars  this is ridiculous  look i am used to a certain level  of comfort in my life  and i didnt want to sacrifice that  okay well i packed everything up  so now youre telling me i have to go unpack it  guys this is a sign  you wanted to leave  and now youre stuck here with me  so we can work all night  this is gonna be so much fun  all night work  all night work  all night work  you know what  theres a bed  breakfast right up the road  im gonna head there  yes lets keep brainstorming  i have a good feeling about this bb  one day theres gonna be a plaque there that reads  this is where leslie knope  came up with the amazing idea for  damn i thought that would work  welcome to the quiet corn  im elsa clack  breakfast is served between 530  and 615 am  what if we sleep to a normal hour  well that would be very rude of you  may i take your breakfast order  we have hardboiled eggs  homemade tomato slices with dry seed and leek jam  and your choice of german muffin  what the is a german muffin  oh good lord  i call the bed  ah  awesome  i hate this place  this place is the exact opposite of skymall  oh listen to this  dear quiet corn  thank you for your beautiful inn  my wife and i spent three nights of ecstasy  in this room  ugh  gyash  there are no tvs anywhere  this place is lamer than outside  im chillin  what is that  jim  tou come sleepin in the tent   oh my god  sleepin in the tent   i found you  i found you   and i had to fight a squirrel   where have you been  i told you i was gonna take you campin didnt i  yeah  well im taking you campin look at this  this is what i had set up at the other campsite  except for it was way nicer there  but thisll do ive got some champagne  and i had to drink most of it to survive  so im kind of buzzed right now  im just glad youre here  can we make out now  no you have to understand  that at the time i genuinely thought  that you and i would never see each other again  i completely understand  well thats what makes you so amazing   no  ann perkins  amazing  oh no  oh no  oh no  no no no i wasnt saying that  i thought we should get back together again  but you said that  you indicated  oh my god this is happening again  i have to move right  yeah  im gonna leave the country  bye everybody bye  hey  hey couldnt sleep  no my room is filled with cat hair and cat smell  and actual cats roughly 12 cats  hmm sounds delightful  leslie what are you doing  i am listening to steal my sunshine by len  a onehit wonder like me  youre not a onehit wonder  well i will be  i peaked at the harvest festival ron  years from now people are gonna say  remember that woman who came up with  the harvest festival idea and never came up  with another idea again  what happened to her what was her name  kim anyway who cares  shes stupid and shes dead now  for the first time ever  the parks department has real momentum  and im gonna ruin it for everybody  youve done more for this group of people  than anyone else  youre the only reason we all still have jobs  i think well be okay  yeah okay well i would love to chitchat about this  but i need to keep working okay  and keep pushing so that my breakthrough will happen  and i will be ready for it  you know what  i just had an idea for a new project   really  yes  yes i think i think this could be really good  what is it  come with me  right through here  wait whats happening  aah ron  ron what are you doing  this is my idea  youre gonna shut your brain down and go to sleep  and im gonna stay out here and guard the door   so you cant leave  no ron  youve been thinking about work  nonstop for years  its time to rest  all my binders are downstairs  shh  all due respect ms clack  stick a german muffin in it  fair enough im just gonna go to bed  just call it a night  i already checked leslie  the transom is painted shut  damn it  oh my god theres like  wheres leslie  not 100 sure  should we reschedule or  nope shell be here  good morning  so i just slept seven hours  which is twice as long as i usually sleep  so im a little disoriented  but i did wake up with a million ideas  and ron would not let me have any paper  so i had to write them down on this doily  we should buy a telescope and make the old ranger station  in ramsett park an observatory  that way we could sell tickets  and have class trips   i like it well  good  then have theme night at the park  we could have singles um date night  uh seniors and we could have a citywide yard sale  which would be part auction part antiques road show  and then we could have  the professors from the community college  come in and assign value to the objects  and then we could split the profits for the school  itd be a lot of fun  ill see you boys later  bye ron  they say youre only as good as your last idea  i say youre only as good as the people you work with  leslie knope is back  ha ha  oh my god my breath is so bad      yeah she died like
