                one of the funner things that we do here in pawnee  is the annual easter egg hunt  tom hides the eggs  and i have to say he did an exceptional job this year  ive been searching for 25 min  and i havent found one and im an adult  yeah i forgot to do that  maybe toms trying to make this year a challenge and if so hes succeeding  i dont think an egg has been found yet  lets keep looking were gonna find one canvassing  im going to see my mom  shes a big muckymuck in the county school system  shes my hero  how do i explain her shes  as respected as mother teresa  shes as powerful as stalin  and shes as beautiful as margaret thatcher   in or out leslie doorway is creepy  right sorry  choosing in  so what do you want leslie  just here to gossip gab chat stuff we do  but it looks like youre superbusy and i am superbusy  so i shall bid you adieu  thats weird i just remembered something  i have my own subcommittee now  im sure youve heard something people are talking

members are we prepared for tomorrow night   have you booked the hall yet  yes sir   ann did you clear your schedule  i did i changed my shift  leslie i just have to say  i think you might be taking this to the public a little bit too soon  it doesnt matter what you propose to the public  they might call for a vote if they vote you down then youre done  i dont care if theres gonna be a vote i have a secret weapon  canvassing  nothing better than good oldfashioned doortodoor campaigning  im not above using my expertise  to change hearts and minds if the cause is just  when i was in sixth grade i was voted best dressed by 87 votes  and there were only 63 people in my class  andy fell into that pit  i fell into that pit  how many more pawnee citizens have to fall into that pit  before we turn it to park  zero say it   zero  a hundred  ive got some sunscreen for your beaks  tom you probably wont need any  and this is our canvassing guide  this is gonna be the script that we use when we speak with people  if a person is a man turn to page two  if the person looks like a celebrity example jack nicholson  use this to help your pitch  example you cant handle the pit  thats why we need to turn it into a park  this is really thorough  ann and i are a team you too we have even sectors  you have odd sectors and were gonna win  win what  go  someones in there   thats gonna be fun excited  yeah   ready are you pumped up  yes  look humble  but confident  good afternoon we are representatives from your local government  may we speak with you about the sullivan street pit  sure  excellent positive response  how would you feel if we turned that pit into a beautiful community park  yeah that would be a great idea  good i live in the neighborhood  so i could probably tell you a little bit about  section three  we are having a public forum tomorrow night  and that would be great if you could come  voice your strong support  tomorrow i cant im busy sorry  we understand that people are busy but we would love for you to come to  sorry good luck though im all for a park   would it change if we told you that  shes gone  yeah a park that sounds like a really good idea  great would you be willing to come to a town meeting and show your support  absolutely  now is this park gonna have a playground or a pool for the kids  how old are your kids  no kids   im gonna put him down as a yes  dont  also is the park gonna be at least a thousand feet from my house  because yeah i really cant move again  april please stand behind me  thats it thats all that we got   no flier  nope  man this is great  this is so great i love canvassing what a great way to spend my time  all right team haverford you guys are awesome  but i think i might work better as a solo artist  so im gonna head out peace   he runs weird  he really does  its a good idea  but im just not sure  okay which part are you not sure about  turning the pit into a park  thats kind of the whole thing  i think this is a great idea but i cant make any forum   i would have to get a babysitter  how old are your kids  four and two  could the fouryearold watch the twoyearold  mickey  whats up buddy hows my number one sod man doing  heres the 1 2 3 of the situation  one were building a new park two im on the committee  three youre putting in the sod  maybe down the line situationll arise where you could hook me up  are you gonna commit to coming to this forum or are you  a bitch  yes you do owe me  okay keep going keep moving  nose to the grindstone no means yes  can we stop please because its really hot and im tired  yeah im hot too  lets blow in each others faces   or we could drink some water  lets do that  my house is really close by lets go take a break for an hour or so  look i didnt want it to have to come to this but ann  please open the sealed envelope thats in your binder  this is a little something i learned from karl rove  if you want to guarantee the results of a survey  you design the question to give you the answer that you want  wouldnt you rather have a park  than a storage facility for nuclear waste  that seems iffy   dont worry i made it all up  yeah thats what i mean  wouldnt you agree like most decent americans  that it would be a good idea to turn  the abandoned lot on sullivan street into a beautiful community park  actually no  im not really a fan of parks  very noisy barbecue smell all the time  would you change your mind if i told you  that nine out of ten meth users said the same exact thing  what  how would you even know that  survey  we surveyed crystal meth users  were actually having a little town meeting tomorrow night   if you wanted to  i know it sounds weird  but i just dont like living near parks  so do you have a flier or something id be happy to take it  you dont care about your kids if you dont support it  excuse me  its what i mean is kids love parks   and you should too  if i dont support your project  then i dont love my daughter   i didnt  what time is this thing anyway   its next month forget it  its tomorrow night ill be there  great  okay come on  we got one  am i talking to the two sexiest thighs in landscaping  yes i am cause im talking to marcy hows it going tom haverford  kevin your sandboxes are the best thats why i want you involved  i want the best monkey bars in my park i dont mind hooking you up  maybe down the line there will be a situation where you can hook me up  thank you for your time sir  he said some upsetting things  i cant believe you gave him your home phone number  well im a public servant i need to be accessible  what the hell is wrong with people  i should show them andys medical bills   maybe theyd have a little sympathy  oh my god  ann game changer   you busted the game wide

fasttracked it right  yeah absolutely we have a public forum tomorrow  okay great   ill be there  great  you fasttracked that right  im sorry  did you say something  you didnt say anything to me  theres a new wind blowing in government and i dont like it  all of a sudden theres all this federal money coming in  and paul the city manager is telling us to build parks  start new community programs  its horrifying   do you have like a nurses costume  costume like scrubs  yeah put those on  bass come on   it can be tricky  dont  why do i want to build this park so bad  maybe because a pit filled with garbage  isnt the best we can do in america  you know in russia they could pretend that pit was a park  bring their kids down there  hey vlad  look at these rocks lets pretend theyre potatoes  nikolai  do you want to swim in the dirt  but not here  cause were a nation of dreamers  and it is my dream  to build a park  that i one day visit with my white house staff on my birthday  and they say president knope  this park is awesome  now we understand why you are the first female president of the united states  builder of parks   how was canvassing  canvassing was okay  but i think were going to have to postpone the town meeting  postpone  only for 1 to 90 days  no youre doing this meeting you have my full support  i was talking to the city manager  exchanging ideas  theres a mutual respect there and  together we have decided to fasttrack your project  city manager  really  i have to cancel this meeting fasttrack  did my nane come up at all   this meeting needs to be canceled  no its happening  look just  just do a good job tomorrow we have to push this thing through  of course  ill push anything through anything you know me   are you sweating through your suit  i doubt it  its a very breathable fabr yeah i am  jerry whats up man  youre into pretzels right  hit em up thanks for coming down i got a seat for you over there  my top priority getting your fences

this early  is jumping the gun  well guess what heres the gun heres me  victor miles  tom haverford how are you thank you so much for coming down  i want to introduce you to leslie  hes a gentleman i met canvassing he also happens to be the top sod guy   in indiana  thats terrific  i really want you to nail this  don from dons cement tom haverford good to see you  thinking of a jingle for your company hows this  dons cement is the best you can get  dons   im so glad youre here  andy came too to give support   i have a lot of stage experience  this will be fine right  its a park for gods sakes how much can they hate a park  a lot of them seemed to hate a park yesterday  april i need you in the audience wait and  if the questions start getting negative  i need you to sell the crap out of the park can you do that  please this is serious  can you do that   probably  good girl  good probably good girl here we go line up everybody  my moms here  i cant do that  thats illegal  thank you so much for coming out tonight this is our first town meeting  about the proposal to turn  lot 48 on sullivan street into a community park  this is gonna be a train wreck  i want my daughter to be successful which is why i always tell her  theres nothing wrong with being a wife and mother  now there are many people  that i spoke to who are passionately in support of this idea  none of them were able to make it tonight unfortunately  but  they totally exist  i did not make them up  i see a question   no questions  my name is kate speevack   i remember you  and i live in the neighborhood  and i am 100  against this park  i cannot believe the department is moving forward with a project  without a single environmental impact study  and if you guys agree with me lets take a stand  we are a little ahead of schedule  because were holding this town hall meeting so soon  which i was warned about  by mark brendanawicz our city planner assigned to this project  so what would he say  here we are  should i give them some background info on the site  absolutely  mark brendanawicz knows the answer to every question  hes amazing and congratulations for hearing him speak  hi there leslie might have oversold me a little bit  certainly did not hes the man hes capable of anything  lot 48 is  its a rectangular lot  its got excellent drainage and its on the corner of sullivan and collins  any questions  i have more of a comment than a question   go for it  its for the guy in the cast  here we go lawrence  that is andy dwyer  he is a local resident  and he tragicay fell in the pit  yeah i dont care about any of that  hes the guy that plays music all night in his garage its driving me nuts  lawrence lives with  his grandma  which is pretty awesome  he takes care of her i guess but whatever hes a douche bag  its loud its abusive and its waking up my birds  you have birds now  yeah i have birds i have nice  pretty expensive birds and you play that music and it wakes them up  look i dont work for the government  i do play rock  roll guilty as charged  im in a band its called just the tip  and actually if anyone here plays bass we need a bassist  lets take a fiveminute break shall we  it is not  going well at all its going very poorly   like youre crashing and burning  democracys happening  people are talking i mean at least they arent apathetic right  youre right about that theyre deeply negative  you need to put a happy face on this give me a few positive talking points  and whatever you do avoid a vote  im oddly attracted to kate speevack  before we continue id love to just give you a little history  of pawnee  the city of pawnee was incorporated in 1817  when a young man by the name of reverend luther howell  came from terre haute on an ox  he planted his flag in the ground  and was met soon after  by an angry tribe of wamapoke indians  who when seeing the whiteness of his skin  twisted him to death  flash forward to 1969  man walks on the moon  pawnee is lousy with hippies  my god shes filibustering her own meeting  filibuster  they cant touch you if you talk forever  i cant speak of the future  but i will  the future of pawnee will involve us flying around in space taxis  where we will communicate on watches  and blink our feelings to each other  rather than use words  and now id like to take  a magical journey through  a little something i like to call the phantom tollbooth   by norton juster  excuse me cant you read   that childrens book on your own time  i have the floor  there once was a boy named milo who didnt know what to do with himself  not just sometimes but always  you know what this is a public forum  which means that we all get to tell you what we think  well you did already talk maam  and i would love to listen to someone else someone i dont know  that girl  long brown hair and yellow top  could you tell us how you feel about this park  go ahead  im a youth in the community  and i think a new park is a great idea  and i fully support it  as would the rest of the youth in the community  i recognize her   that kid came to my door yesterday  oh my god  they have planted people in this audience  unbelievable  we all agree that this park is a bad idea we should just take a vote  we will take a vote before we do that  i want everyone up lined up behind that microphone  i want to hear from all of you onebyone  that was brutal  a couple weeks ago i was yelling at leslie at a public forum  god i hope i wasnt as obnoxious as those people  i wasnt right  at 500 in the morning every morning beep i dont want to hear that  how long is this project gonna take  thats what i wanna know whats important to me   because i need my sleep  thank you maam  that concludes our meeting   what about the vote  were out of time  its 900  but we will have many public forums in the future  and we hope to see you all there thank you so much for coming  it was tough  but you know thats pawnee thats democracy  a lot of people here want this park you just gotta get past the negative people  but guess what  my subcommittee held its first town hall meeting tonight  god i loved it  i loved every minute of it   hey park lady  yeah  you suck  hear that  he called me park lady  normally i dont agree with leslie about anything but this book  is awesome
