little more discontent than canary let me just get some things thatll be 1580 for the lot thanks so did you find a spell book forget the book i just got a better idea oh look at that every time cuts to the left and its not the carpet its me i swear i would sell my soulfor a decent short game of course its a little late for that i dont suppose i could offer your soulit would really help me on the green im just funnin so we havea spike problem do we hes been spotted back in town and there wasan incident at a magic shop in broad daylight  the police had a helluva time covering it up well yes he

wheremy mind goes these days why dont you take care of that spikeproblem a committee like you said  as good as done thats swell fore  college huh higher education kind of an intense proposition where do you wanna go i have no idea my momis the one that got all these shes so excited shecant stop talking about it i had a really hard time coming upwith an alibi so i could come over here  she doesnt know about me big no shes having enough troublewith the slayer issue i dont think shes ready toprocess the information that you and i are friends again anyway i think this college jonesis just a reaction to the slayer thing  she wants you to get out someplace a little less hellmouthy she has a point you knowbut there are reasons to stay too what are they oh and theres my slayer duties
