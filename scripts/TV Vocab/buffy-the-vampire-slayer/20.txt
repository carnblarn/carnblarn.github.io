etruscanmistaken for egyptian by the design pattern but any fool can seeit predates their iconology look the mark of eyghonworn by his initiates eyghon also called the sleepwalkercan only exist in this reality by possessing an unconscious host temporary possession imbuesthe host with a euphoric feeling of power yeah but what about not temporary without the proper ritualspossession is permanent and eyghon will be bornfrom within the host  im guessing eww wait hey listen once called eyghon can alsotake possession of the dead but its demonic energysoon disintegrates the host and it must jump to the nearest dead orunconscious person to continue living  what does this have to do with giles i dont know about giles but ancient sects used to inducepossession for bacchanals and orgies ok giles and orgies in the same sentence i could have lived without that one wait a minutethe dead guys all puddly now so the demons gonethere was no one dead to jump into  i mean were all not dead right no no one dead but someone unconscious  what was that what was what i thought i heard something i didnt here drink that and then ill drive you home you could take me home or you could take advantageof me in my weakened state thank you operator theres no answer at ms calendarsand giles phone is out of order im gonna go over there jenny erm  im really very attracted to you good but now really isnt the

destiny i dropped out went to london fell in with the worst crowdthat would have me we practised magics small stuff for pleasure or gain then ethan and i discovered something bigger eyghon yes one of us would um go into a deep sleep and the others would summon him it was an extraordinary high god we were fools  and you couldnt control it one of us randall he lost control eyghon took him whole we triedto exorcise the demon from randall but it killed him we killed him we thought we were freeof the demon after that but now hes back  and one by one he will kill us all three down two to go then
