yeah and she still listensto heavy metal rickyticky buffy what if i told you that i had a dream about angel and it brought up some questions id say it was to be expected it must have been some dream i didnt thinkyou knew what a card index was for i dreamt that he came back of course after jenny was killed i had dreams that she wasstill alive that i saved her this was vivid really vivid three dimensionalsensurround the hills are alive  do you believe it was a prophecy no i dont know i i guess it just it made me wonder is there a chance even it could happen theres no record of anyonereturning from the demon dimension once the gate was closedi cant imagine how it could happen or why lets just pretend for a second that angel somehow found his wayback to sunnydale what would he be like i really cant say from what is known about the dimensionit would suggest a world of brutal torment and time moves quite differently there so i remember so he would have been down therefor hundreds of years yes of torture it would take someone of extraordinarywill and character to survive that and retain any semblance of self most likely hed be a monster a lost cause maybe maybe not from my experiencethere are two types of monster the first can be redeemed ormore importantly wants to be redeemed and the second type the second is void of humanity he cannot respond to reason or love  i thought faith was on duty oh hey change of plans glazed or cakeits fun to watch them make them they use this spritzy thingand drop the batter couldnt sleep huh ive been to mister donutsince

know what happens debbie please are you all right its ok its ok this creature is especially brutal the phrase coined by the coronerwhen describing platt was pured but he confirmed platt was killedshortly before buffy found him  which means he was killed during the day yes sorry i got ive just beenits horrible horrible its ok will were all glad oz is off the hook indeed shouldnt he be here by nowsunsets at 530 sorry im late did you bring the notes yeah um  you ok what oh yeah im such a klutz i fell down hit your eye doorknob i thanks if you wanna talk  thanks again for the notes yeah our task now is to determinewhat sort of killer clearly were looking fora depraved sadistic animal present i may be a coldblooded donutbut my timing is impeccable but you arent itits a killerinthedaymonster a hundred percent for sure  ok i wish we had time to celebrate properly however we have two victims jeff walken and now platt maybe theres somethingthey had in common missing internal organs  besides that debbie well victim number one jeff  he was in jazz band they horsed around they were screwing i dont think so but he hidher music comp book once debbie knew platt she was seeing him andway vocal about not having love for the guy add this and stir i just saw debbiesporting a nasty black eye ok so pretend debbie wanted platt deadmaybe he fought back no platt was dead in an instant he didnt even drop his cigarette now what if petes the onedoling out the punishment  we should find them immediately debbie was in the quad well split up faith you and i teamwillow stick with buffy and ill go lock myself in the cage its tricky covering a fresh shiner like that  you know what works what dont get hit whats going on ill bet the farm you know  youre wrong i dont know anything you wanna play i have a secret fine but people are dying here it its not his fault  hes not himself when he gets like this you mean pete its me i make him crazy he just does whathe does

in ghostly day and the strain of the primitiveremained alive and active faithfulness and devotionthings born of fire and roof were his yet he retained his wildness and wiliness and from the depths of the foresta call still sounded
