there was a reference to a vampire who upsetthe master and cut his hand off in penance  cut off his hand and replaced it with a fork i dont know  so why would he come after a teacher im not certain he did there was an incident two nights ago involving a homeless personin weatherly park he was practically shreddedbut nothing like dr gregory  fork guy doesnt do heads not historically dr gregorys
