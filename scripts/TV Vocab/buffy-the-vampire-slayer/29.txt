though unwanted unbidden  it will stir open its jaws  and howl   im on my knees to pray   youd think i learn by now   theres never an easy way   ill get through somehow  it speaks to us  guides us  passion rules us all  and we obey  what other choice do we have  passion   he was in my room  who  angel he was in my room last night   are you sure  positive  when i woke up i found a picture hed left me on my pillow  a visit from the pointedtooth fairy  wait i thought vampires cant come in unless you invited them in  yes but uh once youve invited them in thereafter theyre theyre always welcome  you know i think there may be a valuable lesson for you gals here  about inviting strange men into your bedrooms  oh god i invited him in my car once  that means he can come into my car whenever he wants  yep youre doomed to having to give  him and his vamp pal a lift whenever they feel like it  and those guys never chip in for gas  giles there has to be some sort of spell to reverse the invitation right  like a barrier a no shoes no pulse  no service kind of thing   yeah that works for a car too  yes well i i i can check on my  hello  excuse me but have you ever heard of knocking  were supposed to get some books   on stalin  does this look like a barnesnoble   this is the school library xander  since when  uh yes yes third row historical biographies  thanks  what  oh  hey did you say that was the  hello  so angel has decided to step up his harassment of you  by sneaking in her room and leaving stuff at night  why doesnt he just slit her throat or strangle her while shes sleeping  or cut her heart out  what im trying to help  yes uh look itsits classic battle strategy   to throw ones opponent off his game hehehes just trying to provoke you  uh to taunt you to to goad you into uh some mishap of some sort  the nahnahnahnahnahnah approach to battle  yes xander once more youve managed  to boil a complex thought down to its simplest form  giles angel once told me that when he was obsessed with drusilla  the first thing he did was to kill her family   your mom  i know  im gonna have to tell her something   the truth  no youyouyouyou cant do that  yeah the more people who know the secret the more it cheapens it for the rest of us  ive gotta tell her something ive gotta do something  giles angel has an allaccess pass to my house  and im not always there when my mother is i cant protect her   i told you i will find a spell  what about until you find a spell  until then you and your mother are welcome to ride around with me in my car  buffy ii understand your concern  but its imperative that you keep a level head through all this  thats easy for you to say you dont have angel lurking in your bedroom at night  i know how hard this is for you  all right i dont but as the slayer  you dont have the luxury of being a slave to your your passions  you mustnt let angel get to you  no matter how provocative his behaviour may become  so what youre basically saying is just ignore him and maybe hell go away  yes precisely  hey how come buffy doesnt get a snotty  once again you boil it down to the simplest form thing  watchers pet  dont forget i need your sample spreadsheets by the end of the week  ohoh and i want both a paper printout and a copy on disk thank you   willow  yes  uh i might be a little late tomorrow  do you think you could cover my

buffy rupert  willow i thought i might take in a class  figured i could use someone who knows where they are  sorry i have to talk to her shes a teacher  and teachers are to be respected even if theyre only filling in until the real  teacher shows up because otherwise chaos could ensue  how have you been  uh not so good actually um  since angel lost his soul hes regained his sense of whimsy   well that sounds bad  hes been in buffys bedroom  i i need to drum up a spell to uh keep him out of the house  this might help  ive been doin a little reading since angel changed   i dont think you have that one  thank you  so hows buffy doing  how do you think   i know you feel betrayed  yes well  thats one of the unpleasant side effects of betrayal  rupert  i was raised by the people that angel hurt the most  my duty to them was the first thing i was ever taught  i didnt come here to hurt anyone  and i lied to you because i thought it was the right thing to do i  i didnt know what would happen  i didnt know i was gonna fall in love with you  oh god  is it too late to take that back  do you want to  i just wanna be right with you  i dont expect more  i just want so badly to make all this up to you  i understand  but im not the one you need to make it up to  thank you for the book  ok whats wrong  no its nothing  come on you can tell me anything  ive read all the parenting

letting go  buffy has he done anything  no no its not like that  hes just been hanging around a lot  just sending me notes that kind of thing  i just dont wanna see him right now  i mean if he shows up ill talk to him just  dont invite him in  i agree with giles  you need to just try and not let him get to you  angels only doing this to try to get you to do something stupid  i swear men can be such jerks sometimes  dead or alive  i just hope giles can find a keepout spell soon  i know ill sleep easier when i can  sleep easier  im sure he will hes like book man  until then try and keep happy

the clarity of hatred  and the ecstasy of grief  giles  hello  really no  no  no   wheres giles  no luck  by the time we got to the station the cops said hed already left  i guess they just wanted to ask him some questions  cordelia will you drive us to giles house  of course  but dont you think he wants to be left alone  im not worried about what he wants  im worried about what hes gonna do  hello  giles  i guess giles had a big night planned tonight  giles didnt set this up  angel did  this is the wrapping for the gift  oh man  poor giles  look all his weapons are gone  but i thought he kept his weapons at the library  no those are his uh everyday weapons  these were his good weapons the ones he uh  breaks out when company comes to visit   so hes not here  well then where is he   hell go to wherever angel is  that means the factory right  so giles is gonna try to kill angel then   well its about time somebody did  xander  im sorry but lets not forget that i hated angel  long

sometimes more than we can bear  if we could live without passion maybe wed know some kind of peace  but we would be hollow  empty rooms  shuttered and dank  without passion  wed be truly dead  in my years as watcher  ive buried too many people  but jenny was the first ive loved  im sorry  im sorry i couldnt kill him for you  for her  when i had the chance  i wasnt ready  but i think i finally am
