bitter   its chilled us to the bone   we havent seen the sun for weeks   too long too far from home   i feel just like im sinking   buffy   and i claw for solid ground   im pulled down by the undertow   i never thought i could feel so low   oh darkness i feel like   letting go   if all of the strength and all of the courage   come and lift me from this place   i know i can love you  willow  are you sure you should be out of bed   look whos talking  yes   any word  you guys havent seen her either   no  but we know the world didnt end  cause check it out  well we uh  we went back to the mansion it it was empty  um and acathla was was dormant  i think the spell worked  i felt something go through me  plus the orb did that cool glow thing  well maybe it wasnt in time  maybe she had to kill him before the cure could work  well then shed wanna be alone i guess  or maybe angel was saved and they want to be alone together   perhaps  well  shes gotta show up sooner or later   we still have school  yeah  shell be here in a while   everything we say and do   hurts us all the more   its just that we stayed   too long   in the same old sickly skin   im pulled down by the undertow   i never thought i could feel so low   and oh darkness   i feel like letting go   if all of the strength and all of the courage   come and lift me from this place   i know i could love you much better than this   full of grace   i know i could love you much better than this   its better this way
