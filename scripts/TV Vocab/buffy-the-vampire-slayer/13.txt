dont know um distant not brooding or sulking justthere was no connection the more time we spent together the morei felt like she was nowhere to be seen hence the shoes i may have overcompensated a little bit its so strange at least when she wasburning stuff down i knew what to say welcome to my world i havent been able to get throughto her for so long ill just be happy ifshe makes it through the school year it was a nightmare a total nightmare they promised me theyd take me to st croixthen they decide to go to tuscany art and buildingsi was totally beachless for a month and a half no one

nightynight ill just see if angel feels like dancing ms ms calendar oh god ms calendar  shes possessed possessed thats the only explanationthat makes any sense you should have seen her last nightthat wasnt buffy are we overlooking the ideathat she may be attracted to me shes possessed  possessed by what a possessing thing  that narrows it down youre the expert maybe when the master killed hera badguy transference thing happened thats what it was i mean why elsewould she be acting as such a bitch willow were all a little too oldto be spelling things out a bitca yes i suggest that the explanation for herbehaviour may be something more mundane she may simply have whatyou americans call issues her experience with the mastermust have been traumatic she was for a few minutes technically deadshe hasnt dealt with it on a conscious level shes convinced herselfthat shes invulnerable  interesting point on trout you brought up trout trout yes trout is a fish  good morning did you sleep well like a rock masters gone  im sorry the master i went by his grave last nightand they have a vacancy  good god why would somebody want master bones a trophy a horrible conversation piece theyre gonna bring him back theyre gonna bring the master back to lifeand you told me he was history buffy iive never heard ofa revivification ritual being successful but youve heard of themthanks for the warning buffy giles did buy  this is slayer stuff less from the civilians thats enough i believe some of us have classand some of us have jobs yyes well ill see you all in the librarylater well continue this discussion about trout there are some things i can just smellits like a sixth sense no actually that would be one of the five that summers girli smell trouble i smell expulsion and just the faintest aroma of jail before you throw away the keygive her the benefit of the doubt she may surprise you you really have faith in those kids dont you yes i do weird all right ive got somethingits latin so bear with me to revive the vampirethey need his bones  which they have  and the blood  this is very unclear of the closest person  someone connected to the vampire thatd be me  perhaps we were close we killed each otherit really promotes togetherness is there anything onwhen the ceremony whoa this is cordelias come to the bronze before it opensor we make her a meal theyre gonna cook her dinner  ill pretend i didnt say that what do we do  i go to the bronze and save the day i dont like this  well you arent going what do you mean i cant do it any more i cant look afterthe three of you while im fighting  what about the rest of the note what rest of the note  the part that says ps this is a trap youll be playing straight into their hands  i can handle this stop saying that whats wrong with you cordelia may be dead this is my fight you know being stalkedisnt really a big turnon for girls  you need someone to watch your back sure you dont mean my neck why are you ridin me because i dont trust you youre a vampire oh im sorry was that an offensive termshould i say undead american you have to trust someoneyou cant do this alone  i trust me youre not as strong as you think think you can take me what oh come on i meanyou must have thought about it what would happen if it came to a fightyou vampire me the slayer you must have wondered well why dont we find out  im not gonna fight you come on kick my ass dont you have somewhere to be  i do well youre wastin time just stay out of my way happy to oblige thats not cordelia cordelia couldnt make it  where is she im not supposed to tell i dont like this  dont like what theres the bait wheres the hook youre right why would they send just one we should have gone with her buffys about to lose it we shouldtry to reach minimum safe distance you know its a trap the latin is translated fromthe sumerian and rather badly closest to the masteractually translates as nearest physically the person or persons who were with him when he it is a trap it just isnt for her watch her dont kill her unless you have to buffy whats going on ill be back xander what happened vampires the ones you couldhandle yourself  where are the others i dont know i dont know what your problem iswhat your issues are but as of now i officially dont care if youd worked with us for five secondsyou coulda stopped this wwe just have to thinkwhere would they have taken them if they hurt willow ill kill you why did they take them and not you giles said the ritual was um they needed people who were close tothe master physically close when he the ones who werewith the master when he died giles willow cordelia ms calendar odds are theyve got a complete set by now we need to find out where how one more time where are they youre too late your friends are dead tell me where they are what are you gonna do kill me as a matter of fact yes but since i wont kill you any time soon the question becomeshow are we gonna pass the time till then so one more time begin behold these poor mortals witnesses to our masters wretched demise they will breathe their last this night the blood that pours from their throatswill bring new life to the old one we gather for his resurrection for the dawn of this new hell buffy buffy we gotta do something now  you two get the others out we need you to distract the vampires  right what are you

comfortingas it was meant to be well points for effort ill see ya hey buffy hey we saved you a seat theres a rumour going around that mr coxis the most boring teacher in the world like i think he won
