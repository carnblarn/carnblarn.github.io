because i cant kill thingswith my bare hands buffy dont cry im sorry i was too hard on you sometimes i unleashi dont know my own strength its bad im bad im a bad bad bad person will im in trouble and faith acts like she doesnt even care the way she talksits like she didnt even make a mistake do you think shes like in shock i dont know but i think that detectiveknows more than hes saying  i think he knew that i was lying you have to go to giles buffy hell know what to do giles buffy i dont really know how to say thisso im just gonna say it i know ive kept things from you before but but but ive been blowing off my classes you know in the sense of not attending  and its ok buffy i told him  you told him i had to he had to know what you did what i did giles no thats not what happened  i dont want to hear it no i  i want no more lies you cant be serious youre setting me up in my office faith well talk in the morning  giles please you have to now im sorry giles i didnt do this i swear look i know that i messed up badlybut the murder was faith i know she may have many talents buffybut fortunately lying is not one of them oh god  i thought im sorry i needed her to think that i was on her sidei dont know how far shell take this charade try far like all the way  you should have come to me right off i know well i wanted to  but faith wouldnt hear of it its not all her fault we both thought it was a vampirei only realised a second before buffy this is not the first timesomething like this has happened its not the slayer is on the front lineof a nightly war its tragic but accidents have happened  what do you do well the council investigates metes out punishment if punishment is due i have no plan to involve them i mean its the last thingfaith needs at the moment shes unstable buffyshes utterly unable to accept responsibility shes freaking so then we just have to help her deal right shes in denial there is no help for heruntil she admits what happened i could talk to her perhaps or maybe im too close  maybe one of the guys could we should meet it may be that theyre seeinga different side of her ok in the meantime no one else is to know understood of course now this is extremely delicate if we scare her off nowwe may lose her forever yes hello mr travers pleasequentin travers wesley wyndampryce calling the codeword monkey monk just put him on will youthis is an emergency maybe we should talk to faith together you mean like that intervention thingyou guys did on me as i recall xander and inearly came to blows you nearly came to blowsi nearly came to loss of limbs no faith is too defensivefor a confrontation like that shed respond betterto a oneonone approach i can be the one on her one lets rephrase i think she might listen to me we kind of have a connection a connection why would you think that im saying its worth a shot thats all no i dont see it xander i mean of all of us youre the one personarguably faith has had the least contact with yeah but we hung out a little  recently and she seemed to be responsive when did you guys hang out she was fighting one of thoseapocalypse demon things and i helped her  gave her a ride home and you guys talked not extensively no then why would you i dont need to say oh i got it before they slept together fine lets move on look i know that you mean well xanderbut i just dont see faith opening up to you she doesnt take the guys that shehas a connection with very seriously theyre kind of a big joke to her no offence oh no i meanwhy would i be offended by that however if you still want to be of assistancei need some help with research theres still the business ofthe mayor and mr trick to attend to yeah they seemed pretty cosythe other night willow can you access the mayors files what sure i can try good yes because clearlywell need to take a harder look at him hes obviously up to something what about faith i dont know we need time she needs help now i owe her that what i just came by to

try to take yaunder any circumstances see here feel thatprobably like a wet noodle to ya huh  five minutes thats all i need for talkingin conversation im quick as a bunny the clock is running its just i heard about what happenedand i thought you might need a friend so go talk to buffyshes the one who killed the guy yeah i heard that version version either way it sounds like it was an accidentand thats the important part no the important part is thatbuffy is the accidental murderer faith you may not think sobut i sort of know you and ive seen you postbattle and i knowfirst hand that youre like a wild thing and half the timeyou dont know what youre doin and youre living proof of that arent you see you can try to hurt me but right nowyou need someone on your side what happened wasnt your

ill be back look i i dont want you to get your hopes up buffyshe may not want us to help her she doesshe just doesnt know how to say it she killed a manthat changes everything for her giles said with counsellingthey might not lock her up thats not what i mean shes taken a life i know shes got a taste for it now not one slayer but tworight here in the building  there was supposed to be a guard here comes my favourite part where the slayers see usin the hall together thick as thieves wait we are thieves and worseand now they know it theyre not gonna be much of a threat in jail we dont have near enoughevidence to put em away no youre gonna have to come upwith a more efficient solution and mr trick youd better think of it soon i know whats goin on with you join the clubeverybody seems to have a theory but i know what its like to take a life feel a future a world of possibilitiessnuffed out by your own hand i know the power in it the exhilaration  it was like a drug for me yeah sounds like

of these things faith you have a choice youve tasted something few ever do i mean to kill without remorseis to feel like a god right now all i feelis a cramp in my wrist let me go but youre not a godyoure not much more than a child going down this path will ruin you you cant imagine the price for true evil yeah i hope evil takes mastercard you and me faith were a lot alike time was i thought humans existedjust to hurt each other but then i came here and i found out that there areother types of people people who genuinely wanted to do right and they make mistakes they fall down but they keep caring keep trying if you can trust us faith this can all change you dont have to disappear into the dark what by the order ofthe watchers council of britain i am exercising my authorityand removing you to england where you will accept the judgementof the disciplinary committee im sorry for the extreme measures unfortunately this isa rather extreme circumstance whatever please believenobody is rushing to judgement the first priority of both myselfand the council is to help you now none of that tighten her restraintsfaith theres no point in fighting this have to disagree with you unlock theseor ill pop this guys head like a grape dont even think about it faith you cant keep running wrong again wes it was the new watcherhe had a couple of guys helpin him then he figured it out which means faith will be soon on her wayto england to face the watchers council  and then what theyll lock her away for a good long while so we head them off at the airportand stop them can i im just wondering why im not the most objective i know i kinda have an issue with faithsharing my people but she murdered someoneand accused buffy then she hurt xander i hate to say itbut maybe she belongs behind bars shes out of control but angel was gettingsomewhere with her she was opening up  if we could just stop wesley thats no longer an issue  you let her get away let wouldnt be how id phrase it but  yes she escaped thats good work terrorise herthen put her back on the streets that was hardly my plani was trying to save her  but you didnt you probably destroyed her buffy
