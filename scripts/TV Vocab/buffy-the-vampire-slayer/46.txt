thathes not around so much ixnay on the caramel corn thoughif you go backstage but were still talking party some of us stilllove to relish celebrating the birth of the buff i dont know it might be time to puta moratorium on parties in my honour they tend to go badlymonsters crash people die but 18s a big one buffy i meanyou can vote now you can be drafted you can vote not to be drafted i think ill celebrate this onewith quiet reflection wheres it written that quiet reflectioncant be combined with cake and funny hats buffy present present theyre not theyre from your father his quarterly projections are unravellingand he cant afford to take off he promises to make it up to youits all right there in the letter if you want i could ask somebodyto cover for me at the gallery i mean if you want me to take you no no thats not necessary i was just thinking it might benice to have a quiet birthday  how much longer hobson five maybe six hours sir once youve finishedyou and blair can get some rest but sleep in shifts were getting very close the slayers preparation is nearly complete you know its not just cartoon charactersthey do pieces from operas and ballets brian boitano doing carmen is a life changer he doesnt actually play carmenbut a lot of sophisticated people go yes i think we should startwith the grounding crystal again its usually somethingthat families do together look very carefully forthe tiny flaw at its core if someone were free theyd taketheir daughters or their student or their slayer yes but buffy i thinkwe should concentrate now now look for the flaw at its centre buffy im sorry did i zone out on you im just im nursing that flu bug best take care of that  perhaps we should call it a night yeah thats a good idea thanks good night hows it going with amy the rat good she loves her exercise wheelshe runs around her nose wiggles i meant hows it going changingher back into a human being still working on itbut i just got her the cutest little bell you dont do that to mei waited for you at the bronze all night and the big deal is you made me look like somekind of dork in front of my posse first of all posse pass second anyone with a teaspoon of brainsknows not to take my flirting seriously especially with myextenuating circumstances  what circumstances rebound look it up  hey im not through here i beg to differ  what is wrong with you the chick started it are you ok ok i just got swatted down by someno neck and rescued by cordelia  what is happening it will sort itself out look youre not getting the big picturehere i have no strength i have no coordination  i throw knives like a girl like im not the slayer look buffy i i assure you given time well get to the bottomof whatevers causing this anomaly  promise me yes i give you my word youre having doubts cruciamentum is not easyfor slayer or watcher but its been done this wayfor a dozen centuries whenever a slayer turns 18its a timehonoured rite of passage its an archaic exercise in cruelty to lock her in this tombweakened defenceless and to unleash that on her if any one of the council still had contactwith a slayer they would see but im the one in the thick of it you cant make this decision youre too close  thats not true a slayer is not just physical prowess she must have cunning imagination a confidence derived from selfreliance and believe me once this is all overyour buffy will be stronger for it or shell be dead for it rupert if this girl is everything you saythen youve nothing to worry about sir if you can spare me for a short spellill need to make a run to the hardware store take care of it come along come along kralik your pills open your mouth thats enough close it up a curse on slayers oh no wait its lawyers maybe were on the wrong track withthe whole spell curse and whammy thing maybe what we should be looking foris something like slayer kryptonite faulty metaphor kryptonite kills you assume i meant green kryptonitei was referring to red kryptonite which drains superman of his powers wrong gold kryptonites the powersucker the red kryptonite mutates superman into guys reality buffy i know you are definitely withouta doubt gonna get your powers back thanks will but what if you dont ok if i dont get my powers back then i dont ill deal  and theres a whole lot of good sides to it actually this could open up so many  did you find

arm in a box im sorry its just suddenly theres this chancethat my callings a wrong number and  its freaking me out a little thats understandable angel what if i have lost my power youve lived a long time without ityou can do it again i guess but what if i cant ive seen too much i knowwhat goes bump in the night not being able to fight it what if i just hide under my bedall scared and helpless or what if i become pathetic hanging out at the old slayers hometalking about my glory days showing them the stake i had bronzed buffy you could never be helplessor boring not even if you tried dont be

the effect is temporary youll be yourself again in a few days you its a test buffy its given to the slayer once sheif she reaches her 18th birthday the slayer is disabled and then entrapped with a vampire whomshe must defeat in order to pass the test the vampire you were to face has escaped his name is zackary kralik as a mortal he murdered and torturedmore than a dozen women before he was committed toan asylum for the criminally insane when a vamp you bastard all this time you sawwhat it was doing to me all this time and you didnt say a word  i wanted to liar in matters of tradition and protocoli must answer to the council my role in this was very specific i was to administer the injections and todirect you to the old boarding house  on prescott lane i cant i cant hear this buffy please who are you how could you do this to me i am deeply sorryand you have to understand if you touch me ill kill you you have to listen to me becauseive told you this the test is invalidated you

longer ill have your daughter i wont kill her ill just make her like me different shell go to sleep and when she wakes upyour face will be the first thing she eats i have a problem with mothersim aware of that i was just trying to reach you  i was on watch by the boarding house then youll know whats happened yes hes killed hobsonand made blair one of his own your perfectly controlled test seems to have spun rather impressivelyout of control dont you think  it changes nothing well then allow me ive told buffy everything that is in opposition to the councils orders yes interestingly i dont givea rats arse about the councils orders there will be no test the test has already begun your slayerentered the field of play ten minutes ago  why i dont know i returned there as she entered  giles weve no business interfering this is not business hide and seek hide and seek why did you cometo the dark of the woods to bring all these sweetsto grandmothers house oh no no just a little lower

oh that man  i cant get these theyre too tight cant you just not right now maybe theressome clippers around congratulations you passed you exhibited extraordinary courageand clearheadedness in battle the council is very pleased do i get a gold star  i understand that youre upset you understand nothing you set that monster looseand he came after my mother you think the test was unfair i think you better leave townbefore i get my strength back were not in the business of fairwere fighting a war youre waging a war shes fighting it mr giles if you dont mind  the test is done were finished not quite she passed you didnt the slayer is not the only onewho must perform in this situation i have recommended to the council that you be relieved of your dutiesas watcher immediately youre fired on what grounds your affection for your charge hasrendered you incapable of clear judgement you have a fathers love for the childand that is useless to the cause it would be best if you hadno further contact with the slayer  im not going anywhere i didnt expect you would adhere to that however if you interfere with the newwatcher in any way you will be dealt with  are we clear were very clear congratulations again bite me yes well colourful girl i cant believe giles was firedhow could giles get fired so how did you manage to kill kralik she was very clever  you go ahead and tell it you tell it better when you say fired do you mean fired youre not cruising pastthat concept anytime soon are ya well its just i mean hes been firedhes hes unemployed hes between jobs giles isnt going anywhere willhes still librarian  ok but im writing an angry letter nothings really gonna change the important thing is that i kept up mybirthday tradition of misery and horror bright side to everything ill just feel better wheni get my strength back give you a hand with that little lady youre loving this far too much admit it sometimes youjust need a big strong man will give me a hand with that
