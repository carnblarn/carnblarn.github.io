that out i can take it i can take the truth do you love me what do you i love you i dont know if i trust you  well maybe you shouldnt do either maybe im the one who should decide i did a lot of unconscionable thingswhen i became a vampire drusilla was the worst she was an obsession of mine she was pure and sweet and chaste and you made her a vampire first i made her insane killed everybody she loved visited every mental tortureon her i could devise she eventually fled to a convent and on the day she took her holy orders i turned her into a demon well i asked for the truth fords part of some societythat reveres vampires practically worships them i dont know what he wants from you but you cant trust him buffy  ford i had a great time last night well an interesting time  im glad do you
