                in every generation there is a chosen one she alone will stand against the vampiresthe demons and the forces of darkness she alone will stand against the vampiresthe demons and the forces of darkness she is the slayer i will be whole i will be new thank you cordelia  thats going to be lovely but i didnt do the part with the sparklers well save that for the dress rehearsal lisa please  if it isnt the great producer had to see this to believe it oh you three the school talent show how everdid you finagle such an assignment our new fhrer mr snyder i think they call them principals now he thought i should havemore contact with the students i tried to explain thatmy vocational choice of librarian was a deliberate attempt to minimisethat contact but he would have none of it giles into every generation is born onewho must run the annual talentless show you cannot escape your destiny if you had any shred of decency you wouldhave participated or at least helped nah i think ill take onyour traditional role and watch  and mock and laugh ok i think maybe we better leave ourmr giles to this business he calls show principal snyder so we think school events are stupid and wethink authority figures are to be made fun of no no we dont unless you do and we thinkour afternoon classes are optional  all three of you left campus yesterday but we were fighting a demon  fighting not fighting no we left to avoid fighting real antisocial types you needto integrate into this school people i think i just found three eagernew participants for the talent show  what no please ive been watching you threealways getting into one scrape were really sorry but aboutthe talent show you cant make us my predecessor mr flutie may have gonein for all that touchyfeely relating nonsense but he was eaten youre in my world now and sunnydale has touched and feltfor the last time can i just mention that detentionis a timehonoured form of punishment i know the three of you will come up witha wonderful act for us to watch and mock and laugh at no no thank you eugh a dummy yeeow mime i think dummies are cute you dont they give me the wigever since i was little what happened i saw a dummy it gave me the wigthere really wasnt a story there hi im morgan and im sid hey morganwould you like to tell some jokes would i as a matter of fact it is its also a wood noseand a wood mouth  i didnt sleep at all last night all right time out lets stop this before someone gets hurt kid you are the worsteven i can see your lips move come on sid youre spoiling my act i worked on these jokes for weeks you call those jokes my jockey shortsare made out of better material and theyre edible you see im sure you three cancome up with something equally exciting is anybody there hello hello i will be flesh i reach into the hat and out comes uh has anybody seen a rabbit  i cant do this xander come on i cant i have my pride ok i dont have a lot of my pridebut i have enough so that i cant do this a dramatic scene is the easiest wayto get through the talent show because it doesnt require an actual talent but we have talent we can do stuff  buffy uh what can i do slay vampires on stage maybe in a funny way willow you can do stuff uh the piano  you play a little cool you could playand we could attempt to sing oh in front of other people then no i dont play what happened to corporal punishment mmmmmm look at the goodies morgan youre really getting good  where did you come up with that voice its kind of an imitation of my dad  sounds real it is real im the one with the talent herethe kids dead weight how about you and ido a little rehearsing on our own honey hey you know what they sayonce you go wood nothings as good ok morgan we get the jokehorny dummy haha very funny but you should consider some new shtick unless you want your propending up as a duraflame log kids today need discipline its an unpopular wordthese days discipline i know principal flutie would have said kidsneed understanding kids are human beings thats the kind of liberal thinkingthat leads to being eaten i think perhaps it wasa little more complex than that this place has quite a reputation suicide missing persons spontaneous cheerleader combustion you cant put up with that you gotta keep an eye on the bad element like those three kids i dont like them from now on youre going to seea very different sunnydale high a tight ship clean orderly and quiet  it was emily emily dancer emily oh man i hate this school it must have happened after dress rehearsals there was a crosscountry meetshe never showed up for it  vampire i think not giles share what happened  her heart was removed yikes does that mean anything to youbesides ewww there are various demonswhich feed off human hearts but but demons have claws and teeth they got no use for a big old knife  which very likely makes our murderer human did i mention i hate this school so emily was killedby a regular human person the evidence certainly points that way no wait im not buying you guys remember the hellmouth mystical activityis totally rife here this to me says demon id like to think youre right a demonis a creature of evil pure and simple a person driven to kill is its more complex and the creep factor is also heightened it could be anyone it could be me its not though demon or no we have investigating to do i suggest we start withyour talent show compatriots one may have been the last to see her alive i didnt know her welltheres a dancerband rivalry  heard about that but i did speak to her the day that  yesterday how did she seem happy she was psyched to be in the show she was a really good dancerhere pick a card no wait wait waitnot that one pick this one remember the last time you saw her  she was talking to someone who that smart guy the one with the dummywhats his name  morgan yeah thats it  he was acting kinda strange strange how its just such a tragedy for me  emma was like my best friend emily well morgans just strange hes alwaysrubbing his head a lot and moaning  especially the other day he seemed paranoid looking at everyone i think i saw him arguing with his dummy all i can think is it could have been me we can dream right now you and me gotta be onthe lookout figure out whos gonna be next how are we supposed to hi hello i was just working on throwing my voice uh morgan did you notice anything weirdgoing on around here yesterday weird what do you mean with emily did she say anything to youwas she arguing with anyone no she was dancing  sid and i were talking talking rehearsing so you didnt notice anything weird at morgan are you ok look sweetheart he answeredyour question now leave him alone ok morganhow about talking to me yourself now hes said all hes gonna say its ok sid were done im sorrylook i didnt mean to make you mad no im its him hes we have to go cute couple next time we split upsomeone else is on cordie detail we came closeto having another organ donor i had more luck everyone i talked topointed their fingers at the same person  morgan morgan  we have a winner i fear i was led to the same conclusion well what do we dowe wanna bring him to justice we could set up a sting operationwhere we get him to confess  i should wear a wire whoa hey guys all we know is that morgan is a grade aweirdo that doesnt lead to murderer  the guy talks to his puppet and for his puppet yeah but what aboutthe whole its a demon theory im looking into that but my investigationis somewhat hampered by life in the theatre uh priority check giles talent show murder yeah we cant do the talent showim not able to think it principal snyder is watching us all closely if he chooses he can make all our livesdifficult a slayer cannot afford that we will find this murdererbut in the meantime the show must go on  this is so unfair buffy you watch morgan  see if theres anything in his locker like a heart or something  all right ill pull up his locker number can i still wear a wire ok two to the left three to the right principal snyder  what are you doing uh looking for something school hours are overyou therefore should be gone and im going any minute now there are things i will not tolerate students loitering on campus after schoolhorrible murders with hearts being removed and also smoking well i dont do any of those thingsnot ever theres something going on with you ill figure it out sooner or later do you need something here oh yeah right um a friend wanted meto get something out of his case he must have taken itand forgotten to tell me get along home now its late no i cant do it its the only way  i dont want shes the one  but you saw what she did how strong she is  i know but shes the last just this one more and ill be free  i wont i will hi hon hows it going with the talent show itll be over soon it cant be that bad l for oneam looking forward to seeing your act seeing in the sense of actually attending  of course uhuh no mom you

about bills sweetheart you shouldnt go to sleepwith the window open i didnt and my lovely assistant steps into the box and behold you were supposed to leave i dont understand whyi have to follow brett and his stupid band because we have toclear their equipment before the finale but the mood itll be all wrong my song is about dignityand human feelings and personal hygiene or something anyway its sappy and no one is gonna befeeling sappy after all that rocknroll  what oh im sorry um your hair theres something wrong with my hair oh my god xander was right it worked like a charm hello you look a bit worse for uh what exactly are you the worse for  wheres morgan i havent seen him  did he do something to you no it was his sid the dummy ok everyone look at me like im in a bunnysuit cos thats how stupid i feel saying this i think sid was in my room last night  with morgan no he was alone and alive  did you see him i saw something it ran across my floor and it attacked me attacked you how  it pounced on my face like a cat yeah exactly but when i turned the lights oni think it went out my window  like a cat yeah no it was sid the dummy or the nightmare of somebodywho had dummies on her mind you did say they creep you out excuse me can i have some support here im notjust some crazy personim the slayer the dummy slayer theres nothing funny about that well on the side ofthe morgans just crazy theory there is well morgan id like to see morgan without his better halfbet he could tell me something oh if its any consolationi may have found a possible demon culprit theres this reference in hereto a brotherhood of seven demons who take the form of the unhumans every seven years these demonsneed human organs a brain and a heart to maintain their humanityor they revert back to their original form which is slightly less appealing so morgan could still be the guy only demon morganinstead of crazy morgan except that these demonsare preternaturally strong and morgan is well he seems to begetting weaker every day as a result of thispresident monroe put forth the eponymous  meaning named after oneself monroe doctrine which in one senseestablished the us as a local peacekeeper looks like someone digs youthats adorable you and the dummycould tour in the freak show ok who can tell mehow spain responded to this policy morgan morgan what morgan has other things on his mind  give me your puppet ill put him away youll get it back after school ok then in the first part of the 19th century im still watching you morgan that is enough  mrs jackson morgan  you said youd give me oh of course you know i wanted to ask youis everything ok  at home here at school yeah its great i feel like youve become a little detached youre one of the brightest kids ive seenbut lately it seems like youre not all there  dont let other things get in the way ok can i get sid now sure  its gone gone what do you mean gone  where could he have gone i put it right here he knew to wait for me he knew id be back  what do you mean he what did you do with him where is he  where did you get that oh i took it out of mrs jacksons cupboard you said you wanted to speak to morganalone and well morgans alone and sids with me hi buffy hi willow would youlike to hear some offcolourjokes  i dont think you should be doing that what come on  im not real xander quit it hes not real i think our demonstrationproves that sid is wood now why dont you go find morganand prove hes whatever he is  i imagine hes looking for his puppet ill go find morgan  you watch the dummy byebye now im inanimate redrum redrum  what do we do with him hey ill keep him company willow we have some huntingof our own to do once again im banished tothe demon section on the card catalogue you concentrate on reanimation theoryill do organ harvesting  unless youd prefer thats ok you can have the organs so i guess its just you and me huh that looks more comfortable morgan morgan principal snyder  looking for something have you seen morgan shay you know with everythingthats been going on recently im not sure how safe it isfor a girl like yourself to be here alone well i was just leaving and i know how to take care of myself all right then look what i found in toys and magic on rare occasions inanimate objectsof human quality such as dolls already mystically possessedof consciousness have acted upon their desireto become human by harvesting organs  emilys heart morgans dummy  what is it hes gone sids gone what oh morgan morgan the demons got himself a brain whoevers out thereim gonna hurt you badly if youll just give me a minute you win now you can take your heart and your brainand move on they would have made great trophies  that would have been justice yeah except for one thing you lost and now youll never be human yeah well neither will you what this is what i do i hunt demons yeah you wouldnt know it to look at me lets just say there was me there wasa really mean demon there was a curse and the next thing i knowim not me any more im sitting on some guys kneewith his hand up my shirt and ever since thenyouve been a living dummy the kid here was righti should have picked you to team up with  but i didnt because because you thought i was the demon who can blame me for thinkinglook at you youre strong athletic limber nubile im back in any case now thatthis demons got the heart and brain he gets to keep the human form hes infor another seven years its nice to havesomeone else explain all these things there were seven of these guysive killed six if i can get the last onethe curse will be lifted and ill be free im sure its someonein that stupid talent show but now the demon will be moving on  so if someones missing from the show well know who our demon is  the show what its going to start i should be there pull everyones addressesif theyre not there we can find them at home you get em on stage form the power circlethen we can see whos a noshow  um the what the power circle you get everyone togetheryou get em revved up right howd he ever get that gig i cant go out there all those people staring at me andjudging me like im some kind of buffy  what if i mess up cordelia theres an adage that if youre feeling nervous you shouldimagine the audience are in their underwear euch even mrs franklin  oh perhaps not all right well assemble on the stagein five minutes for the power thing so whats your deal kid  i dont figure you for a demon hunter im a vampire slayer you youre the slayer damn i knew a slayer in the thirties korean chick very hot were talking muscle toneman we had some times hey that was predummy all right i was a guy so you kill the demonand the curse is lifted right  thats the drill you dont turn into a prince do you  i mean your body is dust and bones  when i say free you mean dead dont get sniffly on me sis ive lived a lot longer than mostdemon hunters or slayers for that matter of course if you wantto snuggle up and comfort me so that hornydummy thingreally isnt an act is it  nope yuck  is everybody here i think so ok heres our lineup quickly everyone um power circle well thats that then everybody get ready thats it all right hold on  no ones missing so the demon isnt here it seems not tell the othersits curtain i must get the show running  right right sid sid im never gonna stop washing my hands so the dummy tells us that hes a demonhunter and were like fine lalalala he takes off and now theres a brain doesanybody feel theyve been keyser sozed sids on the level im surebut why would the demon reject the brain i thought morgan was a smart kid he was look at his grades all as he was even taking college classes  wait a second what  all these sick days he was out for half the year check the school nurses file look at this in case of emergencycontact dr dale liggette california institute of neurosurgerycancer ward  brain cancer thats why he had all the headaches so whatevers out therestill needs an intelligent brain so im safe and its gonna be looking forthe smartest person around what if you calibrated the units of weight you could calculate the maximum velocityachieved before the point of impact gee mr giles youre smartcould you do me a favour what could a demon possibly want from me whats the square root of 841 oh yeah dont worry as long as youre with usthat demon wont get what he wants  oh my pretty cool huh  are you sure no one else can help you out my assistant got sick you wont have to say anything lie down how exactly does it work a good magician never tells his secrets we havent got much time this is ridiculous we cant wait for him to come to uswe have to figure out who were dealing with  i still vote dummy no ok so we ruled outall the people in the talent show because they were all therebut thats before we found the brain right so it probably is one of them giles doesnt know it hes with them all now look giles can handle himselfi mean he is really smart giles  shouldnt it be aimed at my neck no no this way your scalp gets sliced off and your brains just come pouring out  what exactly is the trick trick mark mark  where are the keys marks got it willow hurry how do you lock this thing whats happening i found you let go i must say all of you your timing is impeccable and now for the big finish what are you doing its not enough hell come back you have to get the heartthen all of this will be over  let me i got it thanks its over i dont get it what is it avantgarde o ruler of my country oedipusyou see our company around the altar and l the priest of zeus haha
