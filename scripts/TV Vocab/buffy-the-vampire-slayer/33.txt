museum  a tomb with a surprise inside  you can see all that in your head  no you ninny she read it in the morning paper   oh my  thats whats been whispering to me   sssh  oh yeah  dont worry though  soon itll stop  soon itll scream  waah this doesnt make any sense  well sure it does see   oh no this doesnt make any sense  its senseless  it is but at least you know that so youre learning  yay me it doesnt matter anyway i mean  when in the real world am i ever gonna need  chemistry or history or math or the english language   ok i see your problem  im a moron  will you stop that  youre not stupid youve just had a lot on your mind  you can learn this real easily  but if youre just gonna give up then dont waste my time   wow you are a good teacher  ok look at this  a covalent bond which means these two atoms are linked by  oh hold that thought   ok im learn girl  ok so see here   dja vu  really  yeah  i have this perfect memory of the pencil and  oh hey  you dropped this  its not mine  it might be something of miss calendars  this feels kinda morbid  ive gone through most of her files already  does that make it less morbid or you really morbid  i had to to teach her class  relax will i was making with the funny   does that say restoration  its one of her spells i think  ms calendar wasnt a practicing witch   but she did dabble  willow  oh boy  oh boy  oh boy  neither dead nor of the living  i invoke you spirit of the passing  return to the body what distinguishes man from the beast  so it shall be  restore this one  it hurts yes  good it will hurt more   where am i  you dont remember  everything youve done for 100 years  in a moment you will  the face of everyone you killed  our daughters face  they will haunt you  and you will know what true suffering is  killed  i d i dont  no  no  no no   what are you saying  the curse  this is it  looks like miss calendar was trying to replicate the original curse  to restore angels soul again   she said it couldnt be done  well she tried anyway   and it looks like it mightve worked  so he killed her  before she could tell anyone about it what a prince huh  this is good right i mean we can curse him again  um wwell this um  certainly points the way but the ritual itself  requires a greater knowledge of the black arts than i can claim  well ive been going through her files and  and researching the black arts for fun  or educational fun and i may be able to work this  wwwillow channeling such potent magics through yourself  it could open a door you may not be able to close  i dont want you putting yourself in any danger will  and i dont want danger big no to danger  but i may be the best person to do this  hi for those of you whove just tuned in  everyone here is a crazy person  so this spell might restore angels humanity  well heres an interesting angle   who cares  i care  is that right  lets not lose our perspective here xander   im perspective guy angels a killer  xander   its not that simple  what all is forgiven   i cant believe you people  xander has a point  you know just for once i wish youd support me  and i realize right now that you were and im embarrassed  so im gonna get back to the point which is that angel needs to die  curing angel seems to have been jennys last wish   yeah well jennys dead  dont you ever   cant you hear what im saying  stop it  stop it stop it  what do you wanna do  i dont know  what happened to angel wasnt his fault  yeah but what happened to ms calendar is  you can paint this any way you want  but the way i see it is that you wanna forget all about ms calendars murder  so you can get your boyfriend back  hello  ill have one of these to go  dru  save me some  well ill do a couple of sweeps and then ill stop by  yeah xander was pretty much being a  willow where did you learn that word  my god you kiss your mother with that mouth  i dont know  i dont know what i wanna do  ill ill see you in a little while ok  you know polite people call before they jump out of the bushes and attack you  just wanted to test your reflexes  how about testing my facepunching cause i think youll find its improved  i was on my way to your house saw you walking couldnt help myself  which begs the question and dont think im not glad to see you but  why are you here oh wait no let me guess  your watcher informed you that a very dark power is about to rise in sunnydale   thats about it  great  so you have any idea what this dark power is  its a big rock  cant wait to tell my friends they dont have a rock this big  spike boy you never did learn your history  lets have a lesson then  acathla the demon came forth to swallow the world  he was killed by a virtuous knight who pierced the demons heart  before he could draw a breath to perform the act  acathla turned to stone as demons sometimes do  and was buried where neither man nor demon would want to look  unless of course theyre putting up lowrent housing  boys  he fills my head  i cant ear anything else  let me guess   someone pulls out the sword  someone worthy  the demon wakes up and wackiness ensues  he will swallow the world  and every creature living on this planet will go to hell  my friends  were about to make history  end  ive been on the phone to the museum  the artifact in question is missing  and the curator has been murdered  vampires  and youre sure this was the tomb of alfalfa  acathla and yes  the information provided by kendras watcher seems conclusive  ok somebody explain the whole he will suck the world into hell thing  because thats the part im not loving  well the uh the demon universe exists in a dimension separate from our own  with one breath acathla will create a vortex a kind of um  whirlpool that will pull everything on earth into that dimension  where any nondemon life will suffer horrible and  eternal torment  so that would be the literal kind of sucked into hell  neat  willow i think you should try the curse  i tend to side with your friend xander on this one  angel should be eliminated  oh ill fight him ill kill him if i have to  but if i dont get there in time or if i lose   then willow might be our only hope  i dont wanna be our only hope  ii crumble under pressure lets have another hope  we have  blessed by the knight who first slew the demon  if all else fails this might stop it   i tink  ooh may i may i  thank you well ilets uh hope all else doesnt fail  um how close are you to figuring out the ritual of the curse  i need about a day  and  an orb of thesulah whatever that is  a spirit vault for rituals of the undead ive got one  ive been using it as a paperweight  this means i cant help you study for tomorrows final  ah ill wing it  of course if we go to hell by then i wont have to take em  or maybe ill be taking them for ever  angel has a ritual of his own to perform before he can  remove the sword and awaken acathla  with any luck it should take some time  spike  spike my sweet the funs about to begin  i will drink  the blood will wash in me  over me and i will be cleansed  i will be worthy to free acathla  bear witness  as i ascend  as i become  everything that i am  everything that i have done  has led me here  god are you disgusting  this is really an unforgettable smell  this is the stench of death youre givin off here  and the look says uh crazy homeless guy its not good   get away from me  what are you gonna do bite me  horrors a vampire  ah but you wouldnt bite me on account of your poor tortured soul  its so sad  a vampire with a soul so poignant   who are you  lets take a walk

understands me thats my curse  dog me mustard   my names whistler  there you go  thanks anyway lately it is  youre not a vampire  a demon technically i mean im not a bad guy  not all demons are dedicated to the destruction of all life  what do you mean i can go either way  i mean that you can become an even more useless rodent than you already are  or you can become someone a person   someone to be counted  i just want to be left alone  well yeah youve been left alone for what ninety years already  and what a package you are the stink guy   what do you want from me  i want you to

you  all right  but i dont wanna dress like you  again youre annoying me youre lucky we need you on our side  i have strayed  i have been lost  but acathla redeems me  with this act  we will be free   someone wasnt worthy  dammit  this is so disappointing  there must be something i missed the incantations the blood i dont know  what are we going to do  what we always do in a time of trouble  turn to an old friend  well have our armageddon i swear  tonight sundown   at the graveyard  excuse me  you will come to him  you will come to him or more will die tonight  his hour is at hand  she said more would die i have to go   then i should go with you  no  i need you here just in case  i can take care of myself  and look as long as angels fighting me  then he cant do this endoftheworld ritual
