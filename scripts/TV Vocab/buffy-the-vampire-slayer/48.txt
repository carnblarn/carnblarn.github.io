antivampire activityand a lot of pointless duelling they became the acolytesof a demon called balthazar who brought them to the new world specifically here  you seem to know a lot about them i didnt get this job because of my looks i really really believe that ive researched this townshistory extensively  so why have we not seen them before this they were driven out 100 years ago happily balthazar was killedi dont know by whom and theyre back cos balthazar had an amuletpurported to give him strength when he was killed it was takenby a wealthy landowner named  i dont want to bore you a bit late named gleaves it was buried with him and i believe the few remaining eliminatiare looking for it for sentimental value you dont think this amulet poses any threat oh no not at all nonethelesswe may as well keep it from them buffy you will go to the gleavesfamily crypt and fetch the amulet  i will are you not used to being given orders whenever giles sends me on a missionhe
