course no that doesnt explain whyhes hanging out with the dode patrol somethings going on something weird what are you gonna do talk to the expert on weird xanders teasing the less fortunate theres a noticeable changein clothing and demeanour yes all his spare time is spentlounging about with imbeciles  its bad isnt it its devastating hes turned into a 16yearold boyyoull have to kill him  giles im serious so am i except for the part about killing him testosterone is a great equaliserturns all men into morons hell get over it i cannot believethat you are trying to scully me there is something supernatural at workhere get your books look stuff up look under what i dont know thats your department the evidence you have is sketchy at best he scared the pig  well he did buffy boys can be cruel they tease they prey on the weakits a natural teen behaviour pattern what did you just say um they tease they prey on the weakive heard that somewhere before xander has been acting totally wiggysince we went to the zoo him and kyle went into the hyena cage oh god that laugh  youre saying xanders becoming a hyena i dont know or been possessed by onenot just xander all of them  well ive certainly never heard of herbert theyve found him the pig dead and also eaten  principal fluties freaking out testosterone huh what are you gonna do get my books look stuff up you four  what oh dont think i dont know three kids saw you outside herberts roomyoure busted yeah youre going down  how is herbert crunchy thats it my office right now now youll have so much detention yourgrandchildren will be staying after school wow apparently noah rejectedthe hyenas from the ark cos he thought they were an evilimpure mixture of dogs and cats hyenas arent well liked they do seem to be the schmoesof the animal kingdom why couldnt xander be possessedby a puppy or some ducks  assuming possession is the right word ill say it is the masai of the serengeti have spokenof animal possession for generations  i shouldve remembered how does it work theres a sect of animal worshippersknown as primals they believe that humanityconsciousness the soul is a perversion a dilution of spirit to them the animal state is holy theyre ablethrough transpossession to draw the spirit of certain animalsinto themselves then they act like hyenas only the most predatory of animals are ofinterest to primals so yes that would fit so what happens to the persononce the spirits in them if it goes unchecked i gotta find xander they are strong xander this is ridiculous we need to talk ive been waiting for you to jump my bones i have seen some sick thingsin my life believe me but this is beyond the pale what is it with you people is it drugs how could you a poor defenceless pig what are you doing  get off of me is that what you really want we both know what you really wantyou want danger dont ya  you like your men dangerous youre in trouble you are infected with some hyena thing dangerous and mean rightlike angel your mystery guy well guess who just got mean now stop that youre only gonnamake things worse for yourselves i am gonna call your parentsand theyre gonna take you all home thank you im sorry that is it do you know how long ive waited until youd stop pretendingthat we arent attracted until willow stops kidding herself that i could settle with anyone but you xander i dont wanna hurt you now do you wanna hurt me come on slayer i like it when youre scared the more i scare you the better you smell youre about this close to expulsion people but im willing to talk to the schoolcounsellor and we can discuss options get down from there this instant ow are you insane hurry up weve got to lock him upbefore he comes to  oh my god what happened i hit him  with what a desk  he tried his hand at felony sexual assault buffy the hyena in him didnt no no but in his animal statehis idea of wooing doesnt involve a yanni cdand a bottle of chianti  there that oughta hold him wheres giles at some teachers meeting what are we gonna dohow do we get xander back im more worried aboutwhat the rest of the pack are up to the rest of the pack was spottedoutside herbert the mascots cage  they were sent to the principals office good thatll show em did it show em they didnt hurt him did they they uh ate him they ate principal flutie ate him up the uh official theory is that wild dogsgot into his office somehow there was no one at the scene but xander didnt he was with you oh well thats a small mercy how do we stop thishow do you transpossess someone im afraid i dont have all the pieces accounts of the primals andtheir methods are thin on the ground there is some talk of a predatory actbut the exact ritual is um the malleus maleficarum deals in theparticulars of demonic possession which may apply yes one should be ableto transfer the spirits to another human oh thats great any volunteers oh good point what we need to dois put the hyena back in the hyena  until we know more bet that zookeeper could help maybe he didnt quarantine thembecause they were sick  we should talk to him ok  oh wait somebodys gotta watch xander i will  well are you sure if he wakes up ill be all right go come on willow how are you feeling like somebody hit me with a desk  what am i doing here youre resting you guys got me locked up now cos youre sick buffy said oh yeah buffy and her allpurpose solutionpunch em out knock em down what would she do to somebody really sick thats not fairbuffys saved both of our lives before she came our lives didntneed that much saving did they werent things a lot simplerwhen it was just you and me  maybe when we were alone together i know theres something wrong with mei think its getting worse but i cant stand around waiting for buffyto decide its time to punch me out again look i want you to help me i want you  i am helping you youre doing what youre told buffys trying to help you tooyou know that  or xander does yeah buffys so selfless always thinking of us if im so dangeroushow come she left you alone with me  i told her to why cos i know you better than she does and i wanted to be here to see ifyou were still you you know i am look at me look xander now i know let me out let me out the students have been possessed  yes are you sure  were really really sure you dont seem that surprised by this they were imported from africathey were strange from day one i did some homeworkthat particular breed is very rare totally vicious historicallythey were worshipped by these guys  primals yeah creepy guys they had ritualsfor taking the hyena spirits but i dont see how that happened to your kids we dont know how the ritual worksonly that it involves uh  a predatory act and some symbol predatory act of course that makes sensewhere did you read that  sherman jeffries work on cults and boys  sorry look look we may have enough information so thatwe could pull off a reverse transpossession what do we do get those possessed studentsto the hyena cage right away  ill meet you there well begin the rituals we can guarantee you one  but four more are missing dont worry about that after hyenas feed and rest they will trackthe missing member until they find him they should come right to you willow willow im not listening willow willow xander shut up willow run  i think theyre going they could be faking it no theyre looking for somebody weak i didnt know theyd come after xander  we must lead them back to the zoo and before their next meal individually theyre as strong as youas a group theyre tough but theyre getting stupidergo to the zoo and ill bring them to you i didnt say she looks better than youi said she looks better i heard what i heard joey chewyou have to chew or youll choke i dont see why we have to havethis conversation every time we see them i didnt start it damn  where are the keys huh joey joey joey get out whats going onhey get off get off joey joey joey joey didnt your mom teach you dont play with your food come on you know what you want the pathway to the hyena house  wheres the zookeeper he must be inside ill go in and prepare things you justwarn us when buffy and the others approach doctor uh zookeeper oh of course the uhmasai ceremonial garb yes very good are you uh otherwise preparedfor the transpossession almost oh right the uh sacred circle yes youd need that to um but this would be herewhen the children first came why would you how terribly frustrating for you that schoolchildren could accomplishwhat you could not it bothered me but the power will be mine theyre almost here giles giles where are the hyenasfor the transpossession right here in the feeding areastay back they havent been fed  wheres giles hes laying in wait theyre almost hereshouldnt you bring the hyenas out when the time is rightim gonna need your help theyre right behind me thats buffy get ready  here what is this a predatory act remember uh rightyoull pretend to slash my throat and  and put the evil in the hyenas something like that buffy its a trap willow uh did i miss anything the vice principals taking overtill they find a replacement shouldnt be too hard unless they askwhat happened to the last one  i had nothing to do with that right right  you only ate the pig i ate a pig was he cooked and called bacon or oh my god i ate a pig  the whole trichinosis issue aside yuck it wasnt really you well i
