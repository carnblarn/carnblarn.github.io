wishes cordelia wished for something if it wasa long healthy life she should get a refund she said something abouteverything being different the world wasnt supposed to be like this it was um better before ok the entire world sucksbecause some dead ditz made a wish i just wanna be clear she said the slayer wassupposed to be here was meant to have been here already  it certainly would have helped yes i tried calling her but look im going to have to researchthis anyanka thing further i have some more volumes at home  you two get some sleep watch your back run  buffy summers thats right you wanna tell me what im doing here yes here in order to defeat anyankaone must destroy her power centre it should reverse all wishes she has grantedrendering her powerless again you see without her
