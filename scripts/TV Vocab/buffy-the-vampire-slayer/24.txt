                in every generation there is a chosen one  she alone will stand against the vampires the demons and the forces of darkness  she is the slayer   come on mom please  im sorry honey  dont you understand how important this is  its an outfit an outfit that you may never buy   but i looked good in it  you looked like a streetwalker  but a thin streetwalker  thats probably not gonna be the winning argument is it  youre just too young to wear that  yeah and im gonna be too young to wear it until im too old to wear it  thats the idea  the stores are closing and i still need to order the flyers for the opening  ok ill go to the printers and then get our food  you go to the tailor and pick up my outfit from everyday woman   everyday woman  mmhm theres the receipt  why didnt you just go to muumuus r us  do now make fun of your mother later  turn around baby ive somethin to show ya  wait a sec this is my high score  well aint you just got the prettiest little neck i ever did see  boy you guys really never come up with any new lines do you  do you mind we were talking here  but you promised youd never cheat on me again honey   um id better go  but i aint done yet  all right sugar lips  giddy up  oh youre a rough one aint ya i like that  you must be that slayer ive been hearin so much about  lyle gorch pleased to meet ya  the pleasures mine  this aint over  oh sure they say theyll call  oh bliss mall food   buffy  mom   wheres my dress  your dre   oh oh god  let me guess   you were distracted by a boy  technically   buffy  look i can go get it right now  theyre closed ill just have to fit it in tomorrow   sorry  a little responsibility is all i ask  honestly dont you ever think about anything besides boys and clothes  saving the world from vampires  i swear sometimes i dont know what goes on in your head bad eggs   xander  shhhshsh  its just that im worried were gonna miss class  you know what this would work a lot better for me if you didnt talk  well itd work a lot better for me with the lights off  are you saying that you cant look at me when we do whatever it is we do  no its not that i cant its just more i dont want to  thats great thats just dandy were repulsed by each other   we we hide from our friends  well i should hope so please  all in all this is not what id call a big selfesteem booster  tell me about it just look at you and those clothes  where did you get those shoes   ok you know what i dont need this  ditto like a hole in the head  sex sex  the sex drive in the human animal is intense  how many of us have lost countless productive hours  plagued by unwanted sexual thoughts and feelings   yes  that was a rhetorical question   mr harris not a poll  oh  of course for teenagers such as yourselves  these feelings are even more overwhelming  with all sorts of hormones surging through your bodies compelling you to action  its often difficult to remember  that there are negative consequences to having sex  would anyone care to offer one such consequence  well that depends are you talking about sex  in the car or out of the car because i have a friend  not me   that was in a miata parked on top of the hill and she kicked the gearshift  yeah i was thinking of something more commonplace ms chase  you wanna talk negative consequence what about the heartbreak of halitosis  i mean a girl may seem spiffy but if she ignores her flossing  the bloom is definitely off the rose  like that compares to kissing a guy who thinks  the hoover technique is a big turnon  what about having to feign interest in her vapid little chitchat   just so you can get some touch  now  another consequence of sexual activity anyone  uh else  how about pregnancy that would be a major one right  thank you ms rosenberg among teens  unwanted pregnancy is the no1 negative consequence of sexual activity  so as discussed last week i present you with  your offspring you will split into parenting teams  you and your partner will share equally in the daily task of raising your egg  now please choose a partner and come pick up your children  you wanna have a baby  hey i know we just met  but isnt that xander junior youre holding  buffy how come you werent in class  vampire issues did mr whitmore notice i was tardy  i think the word youre searching for is absent   tardy people show  right  and yes he did notice so he wanted me to give you this  as far as punishments go this is fairly abstract  no its your baby  ok i get it even less  well you know its the sex leads to responsibility thing  which i personally dont get  you gotta take care of the egg its a baby  you gotta keep it safe and teach it christian values   my egg is jewish  then teach it that dreidel song  i cant do this i cant take care of things  i killed my giga pet literally i sat on it and it broke  youll do fine  yeah the only thing that stresses me is when do we tell them theyre adopted  ill just lay that one off on my partner whod i get  well there were an uneven number of students and you didnt show so   im a single mother  no man of her own  do you know what this says about me that im doomed to lead my mothers life   how deeply scary is that  how about this  it says nothing it means nothing  this whole egg experiment is completely pointless  success at last  your playmate is a fellow of repute it seems  its erm lyle gorch and that ones his brother tector  theyre from abilene they uh they made their reputation by  massacring an entire mexican village in 1886   friendly little demons  that was before they became vampires  but um the good news is that theyre  not amongst the great thinkers of our time  i doubt if theyre up to much theyre probably just  drawn here by the hellmouths energy  enough said i propose buffy slays them all in favor   aye  i dont think you should  underestimate them i mean you may need to have some help ifif  why do you all have eggs  hey maybe you can have angel help you find the gorches  yes yes thats not a bad idea strength in numbers  all right i see a lot of hunting getting done in that scenario  please like angel and i are just  helpless slaves to passion grow up   we really  i know  you know this isnt hunting in the classical sense we should  youre right   ok  ok   you see anything  no   ok enough hunting  yeah   that the slayer  yep   aint that angelus with her  yep  well how come she aint slayin  and how come hes about to make me blush  well i dont know tector and how come  youre always askin me so many stupid questions  so you wanna take him or uh you want me to lyle  i say we leave it wait till shes alone  why you scared  no i could whip em both right now if i wanted to  then why dont ya  cause i got me a plan  im the one that does the thinkin remember  yeah you do the thinkin lyle that is definitely your department  so why dont you tell me again why we cant kill em now  ok little egg dude lets see  feeding check  burping ugh check  diapers sort of in theory i guess  ok  good night egbert  im tired of rat how come we cant stay in a nice place  a motel or somethin maybe uh maybe one with an ice machine  cause we got to keep a low profile till we get this slayer business taken care of  well how come angelus is gettin all cuddly with her lyle  i mean does the man have no code  tector  are you gonna be pestering me with these questions all damn day  i just dont like it here there aint a decent whore in the whole city limits  so this is the thanks i get  well  dont i take care of ya didnt i near raise you myself  hm burden that you were maybe i shoulda left you on that doorstep   when momma blew town  dont say that lyle   now im takin care of this  you afraid of the girl  im just playin it safe  were just gonna follow her around a little while find our time   cause this aint over  i think you are afraid of the slayer  all right im gonna beat you like a redheaded stepchild  throw your ass out in that sunlight cmon   you think you can  giddy up son  yippekiyay matey  oh oh god  at least eat something if youre gonna drink that  not that hungry   hows the parenting going  fine  are you sure your egg is secure in that  did i ask for backseat mommying   are we a little touchy this morning  no i just feel all funky  hm you dont have a fever  oh no its not that i just i didnt sleep well  whats the matter your egg keep you up all night  youre killing me parentings a pain  wait till it starts dating  oh why are you three hanging about   dont you have classes to go to  teen health got cancelled  mr whitmore is ab he couldnt find an eggsitter or somethin   well then can you give me a hand  no  sure  how did the um hunt go last night buffy  no go  er no you didnt go or or you were unsuccessful   no gorches  apparently buffy has decided  the problem with the english language is all those pesky words  you angel big smoochies   shut up  itits true buffy  you and willow do seem a little sluggish are you quite sure everythings alright   maybe something we ate  or perhaps its the burden of parenthood  notice how seriously you two have taken this egg thing  while i in turn have uh well chosen a  more balanced approach   xander maybe you shouldnt  thats what im talkin about  you cant stress over every little thing a child picks up on that  which is a oneway ticket to neurotic city  it didnt break how come it didnt break  which is another secret to conscientious egg care  pot of scalding water and about 8 minutes   you boiled your young  yeah i know it sounds cruel  but sometimes you gotta be cruel to be kind  i mean you can bet that little xander here is thickskinned now  technically that would be cheating yes  no its like a shortcut you know when you run a race   that would also be cheating  you should be ashamed  i suppose there is a sort of  machiavellian ingenuity to your transgression  i resent that  or possibly thank you  figures you three would all be hanging in the dungeon  while something majors going on at sunnydale high  and what would that be cordelia barrette appreciation day   mr whitmore didnt show today  that news is of the past  hes missing   presumed dead  presumed by whom  well me  i think we should give him a few hours before we give up on him completely  well i think we should look around dont you xander   it can wait  well his body  could fall out of a closet somewhere  so we should check some closets to see if hes in a closet  youre right there could be a closet lets go  you guys look for more clues well meet back here   well get right on it  are they getting weirder  have you noticed the weirdness of them  theyre weird should i have guilt about not looking for mr whitmore  id rather you conserve your strength for hunting the gorches  ill be fine by tonight maybe ill sweep the cemetery  well be careful if youre still feeling a little sluggish  no worries   and angels helping you right  he does what he can  as much as i hate to say this we should really go kill bad guys  its late you should get home   what about the gorches  ill hunt  really youd do that  not like i have an early day tomorrow  true i still have to go home and fill out my egg diary   your what  oh i told you that  faux parenting gig were doing at school  like im really planning to have kids anytime soon  maybe someday in the future when im done having a life  but right now kids would be a little too much to deal with  i wouldnt know  i dont  well you know i i cant  oh thats ok um  i i figured there were all sorts of things vampires cant do  like work for the telephone company or volunteer for the red cross  or have little vampires  so you dont think about the future   no  never  no  you really dont care what happens a year from now  five years from now  angel when i look into the future aa  all i see is you  all i want is you  i know the feeling  hello is anybody in here   come on pick up  hello   willow are you ok  why shouldnt i be   your egg is it doing anything  doing what  break it right now i want you to smash it with something heavy   buffy what  my egg it went went postal on me  the thing hatched and it it sprung this creepycrawly thing and it attacked me   are you ok  yeah

than that young lady   i had a bad dream  oh no  youre about to have a bad dream  a dream that youre grounded  for the rest of your natural life which means  no afterschool socializing no bronze no nothing  not until i say so do you understand   yeah but i think you  now school ends at 230   i want you to go to the library at 233  and study until i pick you up there at 530 understood   yeah

decade   guys  do we even know what to look for  i mean how are we supposed to figure out what this thing is  turn it over maybe we missed its id bracelet  so now i guess uh we know what happened to mr whitmore   he saw this and ran away  try bestcase scenario  its possible that mr whitmore wasnt harmed  maybe the offspring simply used him to return to the mother bezoar  yeah maybe he what
