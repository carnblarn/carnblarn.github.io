far  you ordered the raid on the school today honey they opened a few lockers lockers first syllable lock they should be privateand they took all giles books away hell get most of them back moo justwants to weed out the offensive material  everything else will be returned soon to solve this we need those books now sweetie those books have no placein a publicschool library especially now any student can waltz in thereand get all sorts of ideas do you understand how that terrifies me mom i hate that these people scared youso much and i know youre trying to help but you have to let mehandle this its what i do but is it really you patrol you slay evil pops up you undo it and thats great but is sunnydale getting any betterare they running out of vampires  i dont think that you run out its not your fault you dont have a plan you just reactto things its bound to be fruitless ok maybe i dont have a plan  lord knows i dont have lapel buttons buffy maybe next time the world gets suckedinto hell i wont be able to stop it because the antihellsucking bookisnt on the reading list im sorry i didnt mean to put down yeah well you did it doesnt matter i have to go i have to go on one of my pointless patrolsand react to some vampires if thats all right with moo and nice acronym mom im just trying to make things better  you are theres bad people out there  and we cant sleep not until you hurt them the way they hurt us  hey hey  how are you im all right i think im better than you right now i heard about this people are talking people are even talking to me its strange people die in sunnydale all the time ive never seen anything like this they were children innocent it makes a difference and mr sanderson fromthe bank had it coming my mom said some thingsto me about being the slayer that its fruitless no fruit for buffy  shes wrong is she is sunnydale any betterthan when i first came here ok so i battle evil but i dont really win the bad keeps coming backand getting stronger like that kid in the story the boythat stuck his finger in the duck dyke its another word for dam ok that story makes a lot more sense now buffy you know im still figuring things outtheres a lot i dont understand i do know its important to keep fighting and i learned that from you  but we never we never win  not completely we never will thats not why we fight we do itcos theres things worth fighting for those kids their parents their parents  i know its not much no no its a lot session interrupted who said you could interruptyou stupid useless fad i said fad and ill say it again at that point i will become frightened  take heart we found your books put the heart back we cant get emtheyre locked up in city hall frisky watchers chat room giles  buffy oz and i found out what do we know about these kids  what facts details  well they were found in the park no where did they go to school who were their parentswhat are their names we know everything about their deathsbut not even their names sure we do its on the tip of my tongue it never came up ever and if no one knows who they arewhere did these pictures come from i just assumed someone had the detailsi never really that is strange  we need to get some information can somebody else do it it locked me out  well if you wouldnt yell at it i can look but willowd know the sites  great she cant even come to the phone we dont need a phone all right were linked if anybodys iddthe kids shell pull it up and feed it here two children found deadmysterious mark no these children werefound near omaha in 1949 yeah they aint ours keep going wait  those are the same kids  a hundred years how is this possible theres no mention of who they were theyve never been seen alivejust dead a lot look there were more articlesevery 50

they have names thats new willow i thought i made myself clearyoure not minding me  mom i see that youre challenging me but i will not have you communicatingwith your cybercoven or what have you coven what happened to mebeing delusional and acting out that was before i talked in depthwith ms summers and her associates it seems ive been rather closedminded so you believe me i believe you dear now all i can do is let you go with love let me go what does that mean mom now wait a minute there is a fringe theoryheld by a few folklorist that some regional storieshave actual very literal antecedents  and in some language thats english fairytales are real hans and gre hansel and gretel wait hansel and gretel  breadcrumbs ovens gingerbread house of course it makes sense now yeah its all falling into place of coursethat place is nowhere near this place some demons thrive by fostering hatredand persecution amongst the mortal animals not by destroying menbut by watching them destroy each other they feed us our darkest fear and turnpeaceful communities into vigilantes hansel and gretel tell everyoneabout the mean old witch then she and maybe dozens of othersare persecuted by a righteous mob
