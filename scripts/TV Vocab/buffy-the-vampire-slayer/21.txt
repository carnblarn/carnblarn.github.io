were harsh god you act like i picked this gigbut remember im the picked what you have is more than a gigits a sacred duty which shouldnt prevent you from eventuallyprocuring some more gainful employment such as i did giles its one thing to bea watcher and a librarian they go togetherlike chicken and another chicken or two chickens or somethingyou know what im saying no one blinks an eye if you spendall your days with books what can i do carve stakes for a nursery point taken i must admit ive never really now theres a thoughthave you ever considered law enforcement what  may i be my guest its a reliquary used to house itemsof religious significance most commonly a fingeror another body part from a saint note to self religion  freaky du lac  oh dear oh dear i hate when you say that josephus du lac was buried here he was in a sect that was excommunicatedby the vatican at the turn of the century excommunicated and sent to sunnydaletheres a guy big with the sinning remember the book that was stolenfrom the library a few weeks ago  yeah it was written by du lac damn it i let it slip my mind with all the excitement i guess it wasnta taste of the vatican cookbook no the book was said to contain ritualsand spells that reap unspeakable evil however it was written in archaic latin sothat only sect members could understand it  so everythings cool its not first the book was taken and now the vampires have stolensomething from du lacs tomb do you think they figured outhow to read the book somethings coming buffywhatever it is i can guarantee its not good bus 219 continuing service to los angelesnow arriving sunnydale  mrs kalish yes hello im norman pfisterwith blush beautiful skincare im not selling anything so im not askingyou to buy just to accept a few free samples  free absolutely what the hell hey youre not supposed to be in here hey come on so giles is sure the vampirewho stole his book is linked to the one you slayed last night  or is it slew both are correct and yes im sure du lac was both a theologianand a mathematician this article describes an invention of hiswhich he called the du lac cross why go to the trouble of inventing somethingand then give it a weak name i mean id have gone with the crossomaticor the amazing mr cross the cross was more than a symbol it wasused to understand certain mystical texts to decipher hidden meanings and so forth so youre saying these vampires went toall this hassle for a basic decoder ring actually yes i suppose i am according to this du lac destroyedevery cross except the one buried with him  why destroy your own work he feared it might fall into the wrong hands a fear well soon get to experiencefor ourselves up close in person unless we can preempt their plans how by learning whats in the bookbefore they do which means we can expectto be here late tonight goody research party will you need a life in the worst way speaking of i have to bail but ill be backbright

both said to head for the hills are you saying i cant handle thisthat i cant fight these people theyre a breed apart buffy unlike vampires they have no earthlydesires but to collect their bounty they find a target and uh they eliminate it you can kill as many of them as you likeitll make no difference where theres onethere will be another and another they wont stop coming until the job is done each one of them works alone his own way some are human some are not you wont know who they areuntil they strike try it  try what uh im sorry im still not clear what im supposed to try nothing god im sorry i that is a tense person i wish there was more we could do were doing all that we can the only course of action is to tryand find out what was in that stolen book ive never seen buffy like
