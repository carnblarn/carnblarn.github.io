their blood its like a whole big sucking thingmostly theyre just gonna kill you  why am i still talking to you you have no idea whats going on do you you think its coincidence your being here why cant you people just leave me alone because you are the slayerinto each generation a slayer is born one girl in all the world a chosen oneone born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires to stopthe spread of evil ive heard it ok i dont understand this attitude youveaccepted your duty slain vampires before ive been there and done thatand im moving on what do you know about this town its two hours on the freewayfrom neiman marcus dig a bit in the history of this place andyou find a stream of fairly odd occurrences this whole areais a centre of mystical energy things gravitate towards itthat you might not find elsewhere  like vampires like zombies werewolves incubi succubi everything you dreaded was under your bedbut told yourself couldnt be theyre all real whatyou sent away for the timelife series um yes  did you get the free phone the calendar cool but ok first of all im a vampireslayer and secondly im retired  hey i know why dont you kill em im a watcher i havent the skill oh come on a stake through the heartits like falling off a log  a slayer slays a watcher watches yes no he trains herhe prepares her prepares me for what for getting kicked outof school for losing all of my friends for spending my time fighting for my life and never getting to tell anyonebecause i might endanger them go ahead prepare me damn what  its getting worse whats getting worse the influx of the undeadits been building for years theres a reason why youre here now because now is the timemy mom moved here something is coming somethingsomething is gonna happen here soon gee can you vague that up for me the signs as far as i can tell pointto a crucial mystical upheaval very soon days possibly less oh come on this is sunnydalehow bad an evil can there be here the sleeper will wake the sleeper will wake the sleeper will wake the sleeper will wake and the world will bleed amen hi im an enormous slut hello would you like a copyof the watchtower i used to be so good at this  hi hon hey

in with the wrong crowdbut that is all behind us now it is from now oni am only going to hang out with the living i mean lively people ok you have fun  is there a problem maam yeah theres a problem why are you following me i know what youre thinking but dont worryi dont bite the truth is i thought youd be talleror bigger muscles and all that youre pretty spry though  what do you want the same thing you do ok what do i want to kill em to kill em all incorrect but you do get this watchand a years supply of turtle wax  what i want is to be left alone do you think thats an option any more youre standing at the mouth of hell and its about to open dont turn your back on this  youve gotta be ready what for for the harvest who are you lets just say im a friend yeah well maybe i dont want a friend i didnt say i was yours whats up hey  hey oh hi hi  are you here with someone no im just here  i thought xander was gonna show up oh are you guys going out no were just friendswe used to go out but we broke up  how come he stole my barbie oh we were five  i dont actually date a whole lot lately why not well when im with a boy i like its hard for me to say anything coolor or witty or at all i can usually make a few vowel soundsand then i have to go away  its not that bad no it is i thinks boys are more interestedin a girl who can talk  you really havent been dating lately its probably easy for you yeah real easy i mean you dont seem too shy well my philosophydo you want to hear it  yeah i do life is short  life is short not original ill grant you but its true why waste time being shy and worryingabout some guy laughing at you seize the momentcos tomorrow you might be dead oh thats nice um ill be back in a minute oh thats thats okyou dont have to come back ill be back in a minute seize the moment like partying with studentsaint that skanky oh right this is me having fun watching clown hair prance aboutis hardly my idea of a party id rather be at homewith a cup of bovril and a good book you need a personality this is a perfect breeding groundfor vampires its dark crowded i knew you would show upi have to make you understand that the harvest is comingi know your friend told me  what did you say the harvest does that mean something to youcos im drawing a blank im not sure who told you this this guy dark gorgeous in an annoyingsort of way i figured you two were buds no the harvest did he say anything else something about the mouth of helli really didnt like him look at them throwing themselves aboutunaware of the danger that surrounds them  lucky them or perhaps youre right perhaps there is no trouble comingthe signs could be wrong its not as thoughyouve been having the nightmares mom doesnt get out of bedthe doctor says its epsteinbarr im like its chronic hepatitisor at least chronic fatigue syndrome i mean nobody coolhas epsteinbarr any more  hey cordelia oh yea its my stalker  you look you look great im glad we had this little chat listen you know
