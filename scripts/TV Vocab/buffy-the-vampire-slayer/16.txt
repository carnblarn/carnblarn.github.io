                in every generation there is a chosen one she alone will stand against the vampiresthe demons and the forces of darkness she is the slayer  this is so unfair i dont think its that bad its the bersuckmom could have at least warned me a lot of parents are doing itits part of this culturalexchange megillah  the exhibit the dance i have the best costume for the dance a stranger in my house for two weeks im gonna be insane a dangerto myself and others within three days i think the exchangestudentprogrammes cool i do its a beautiful melding of two cultures have you ever donean exchange programme my dad tried to sell meto some armenians once does that count ooh theres mine sven isnt he lunchablemines definitely the best  what are you looking at our exchange students so hows yours visually i mean i dont know guylike by guylike we are talkingbig beefy guylike girls right i was just told guy you didnt look at him firsthe could be dogly you live on the edge hold on a sec so this person whosliving with you for two weeks is a man with man parts this is a terrible idea what about the beautifulmelding of two cultures theres no melding okhe better keep his parts to himself whats he doing thats rodney munsonhes gods gift to the bell curve what he lacks in smartshe makes up in lackofsmarts you just dont like him cos of that timehe beat you up every day for five years yeah im irrational that way  i better stop him before he gets in trouble i got it nonviolence is probably better i wasnt gonna use violencei dont always use violence  do i the important thing is you believe that what are you oh willow hi thats probably not something youshould be doing you could get in trouble oh no and they mightkick me out of school are we still on for our chem tutorial yeah i think i got almostall 14 natural elements memorised there are 103 welcome students we shall nowproceed into the incan burial chamber the human sacrifice is about to begin typical museum trick promisehuman sacrifice deliver old pots and pans to become their princess i hope this story ends withand she lived happily ever after no i think it ends with and she becamea scary discoloured shrivelled mummy the incan people sacrificed theirprincess to the mountain god sabancaya an offering buried alivefor eternity in this dark tomb they could have at least wrapped her in thosenice white bandages  like in the movies the princess remained thereprotected only by a cursed seal placed there as a warningto any who would wake her so whens exchangeo boymaking his appearance his names ampatahell be at the bus station tomorrow night oooh the sunnydale bus depot classy what a way to introduce someoneto our county  with the stench of urine now if youll follow me this way please cool damn  so can i go i think not  how come because you are the chosen one just this once id liketo be the overlooked one well im afraid that is not  you have responsibilities oh i know this one slaying entails certain sacrifices blah blahbitty blah im so stuffy give me a scone its as if you know me your secret identity will be difficult tomaintain while this student is living with you not with her in the same house as her am i the only one whos objectiveenough to make that distinction so going to the dance like a normal personwould be the best way to keep that secret giles come on budgeno one likes an unbudger fine  go yay i win ill just go and introducemy shoulder to an ice pack so i guess were dancebound cool i thinki can get my moms car so im wheel man  i thought you were taking willow yeah i am but im not gonna take willowin the sense of take me with you everybodys safewithout you were two ah and we enter datevilleromance flowers lips oh come on in all the years youve knownwillow

hey guys willow hiwe were just talking about happy things like the three of usgoing to the dance together see happy not happy no yes no rodneys missing trouble with mr munson again his parents say he nevercame home last night i dont think i saw rodneyon the bus back from the field trip i didnt eitheri hope he didnt get in trouble at the museum hey maybe he awakened the mummy right and it rose from its tomb and attacked him on the other hand maybe rodneyjust stepped out for a smoke  for 21 hours its addictive you know well deal with thatwhen weve ruled out evil curses one day im gonna live in a town where evilcurses are just ruled out without even saying  where was the seal it was right here and its broken  does that mean the mummys loose no comfy as ever look at this series of pictograms  ok i just saved us right something did well fret about the details later letsjust get out of here before he comes back giles were the incas very advanced yes yes very did they have orthodontists rodney looked like he had been deadfor 500 years how could that be maybe we should ask that crazy manwith the big old knife i dont think he seemed overly chatty the way he bolted when he saw rodneyid say he was as freaked as we were my resources on the subject are limited i gather this mummy was from the sabancayaregion of eastern peru its very remote  if theres an answer then its locked in in the seal it could take me weeksto translate these pictograms  well well start tonight with ampata  i was gonna suggest hunting no im late im picking him up buffy where are your priorities finding a mummifying killer or making timefor a latin lover skilled in breaking hearts ampatas alonei dont know how good his english is hes from south south america  maybe he could translate the seal oh yeah

impress you well it involves a feather boaand the theme to a summer place  i cant discuss it here youre too picky do you know how many girls you couldhave youre lead guitar its currency im not picky youre just impressedby any pretty girl that can walk and talk she doesnt have to talk i worked really hard on my costumeits pretty cool ok but what about me i gotta think a celebration of cultures haslots of dressup alternatives and an equal numberof mocking alternatives all aimed at me  bavarians are cool ok no shirts with ruffles no hats with feathersand definitely no lederhosen they make my calves look fat why are you suddenly so worriedabout looking like an idiot that came out wrong your first day at school nervous it is more peoplethan i have seen in a long time dont worryyoull have no problems making friends as a matter of facti know someone whos dying to meet you how do you do i was wondering if you could translate this that was in no way awkward  is something wrong no it is  why are you asking me well uh its an artefact from your region its from the tombof an incan mummy actually were trying to translate itas a project for our um our archaeology club  very good it is broken where are the other pieces thats all we found its very old valuable  you should hide it is there anything you recognise here this umthis chappie with a knife for instance well i do not know exactly but i think this represents i believe the word is bodyguard bodyguard interesting legend has it that he guards the mummyagainst those who would disturb her well yes thats a very goodstarting point for our um club oh and as club president i have lots to do lots of stuff dull stuff  willow maybe you could stay with ampata for the day id love to yes that will be fun ill continue with the translationbuffy you research this bodyguard thing and willow willow boy they really like each other and this is called a snack food  snack food its a delicious spongy golden cake stuffed with a delightfulcreamy white substance of goodness and heres how you eat it oh but now i cannot try it thats why you bring two here goes good huh the exciting part is they haveno ingredients that a human can pronounce so it doesnt leave you withthat heavy food feeling in your stomach  you are strange girls always tell me that right before they run away  i like it i like you like it please dont learn from my english ha or possible ha do you think this matches hey yes im caring about mummies ampatas only staying two weeks yeah and then xander can findsomeone else whos not me to obsess about at least with youi knew he didnt have a shot well you know i have a choice i can spend my life waiting for xanderto go out with every other girl in the world until he notices me or i can just get on with my life good for you well i didnt choose yet good lord good work  my work yes this is most illuminating it seems rodneys killermight be the mummy  where does it say that well here it implies that the mummy is capableof feeding on the life force of a person effectively freezedying themyou might say  extraordinary so we just have to stop the mummy which leads to the questionhow do we a find and b stop the mummy the answer to that is somewhere still in here or in the rest of the seal you stole the seal where is it it is you  here you are thank you why is this guy so into usi mean whats he want  he said give me the seal this is more popular than we realised i just dont know what we should do with it destroy it if you do not someone could die im afraid someone already has  the man with the knife killed someone uh no well not exactly you are not telling me everything youre right ampata and its time we do were not an archaeology club were in were in the crime club which is like thechess club only with crime and no chess please understand me that seal nearlygot us killed it must be destroyed ampata ampata listen to menobodys gonna hurt you i wont let them your investigation is dangerousi do not want that just normal life is she ok wigged im trying to convince herthat our lives arent just danger around here  you should take her to the dance good idea well all go  no i mean just you but you were psyched and your costume ill see you there you know what willowyoure my best friend i know i dont get it why would the bodyguardhave such a jones for a broken piece of rock well um perhaps he needs to put it togetherwith the other pieces if he has them i mean we didnt find them if he didntthen theyd still be at the museum so maybe we should go there and find themodds are hell show up too right and hopefully well be ready hey look at uswe came up with a plan a good plan  well meet there tonight after it closes no bad plan i have other plans dance plans cancel plans ok i

breaking it freed her reassembling it will trap her ill go to the museum ill drop you offill try and piece together the fragments there ok ill still get xander beforehe gets smoochy with mummy dearest
