hurtingthe master very much he wouldnt send the three forjust anyonewe must step up our training with weapons stay at my houseuntil these samurai guys are history what dont worry about angelwell tell him to get out of town fast youre not in immediate jeopardythe master will send someone else but in the meantime the three having failedwill offer their own lives in penance we failed in our dutyand now our lives belong to you pay attention child you are the anointedand there is much you must learn with power comes responsibility true they did fail but also truewe who walk at night share a common bond the taking of a life  im not talking abouthumans of course  is a serious matter so you would spare them i am weary and their deaths will bring me little joy of course sometimes a little is enough cool crossbow check out these babies goodbye stakes hello flying fatality  what can i shoot nothing the crossbow comes later you must first become proficientwith the basic tools of combat now lets begin with the quarterstaff which incidentally will requirecountless hours of vigorous training  i speak from experience giles 20th century  im not gonna be fighting friar tuck you never know who you will be fighting these traditions have been handed downthrough the ages you show me good steady progresswith the quarterstaff and in due course well discussthe crossbow put on your pads im not gonna

i can think aboutis how badly i wanna kiss you kiss me im older than you and this cant ever i better go how much older  i should go you said what whats wrong buffy what happened nothing i saw a shadow  angels a vampire i cant believe this is happening one minute we were kissingand the next minute  can a vampire ever be a good person a vampire isnt a person at all it may have the movements memorieseven personality of who it took over but its still a demon at the corethere is no halfway so thatd be a no then what was he doingwhy was he good to me was it all some part of the masters planit doesnt make sense all right you have a problemand its not a small one lets take a breathand look at this calmly and objectively angels a vampire youre a slayer i think its obvious what you have to do  it is a slayers duty i know you have feelings for this guy but youre not in love with him right in love with a vampireare you out of your mind what not vampire how could you love an umpireeveryone hates em where did you get that dressthis is a oneofakind todd oldham do you know how much this dress costis this a knockoff its a cheesy knockoff this is what happenswhen you sign free trade agreements we think we have problems  whos here a friend hi its been a while  a lifetime or two but whos counting whats with the catholic schoolgirl looklast time i saw you it was kimonos and last time i saw youit wasnt highschool girls dont you like remember budapest turn of the century  you were a bad boy during that earthquake you did some damage yourself is there anything betterthan a natural disaster the panic the people lost in the streets its like picking fruit off the vine nice youre living above groundlike one of them you and your new friend are attacking us like one of them but guess what preciousyoure not one of them  are you no but im not exactly one of you either is that what you tell yourself these days youre not exactly living off quiche you and i both know what you hunger forwhat you need its nothing to be ashamed ofits who we are its what makes eternal life worth living you can only suppress your real naturefor so long i can feel it brewing inside of you i hope im around when it explodes  maybe you dont wanna be im not afraid of you i bet she is though or maybe im underestimating her talk to her tell her about the cursemaybe shell come around and if she still doesnt trust youyou know where ill be heres something at last  can you please warn us before you do that theres nothing about angel but its been ages since ive read the diariesof any of the watchers before me how embarrassing when you thoughthe had read your diary but he hadnt but then he felt the same way  im listening theres mention some 200 years ago in ireland of angelusthe one with the angelic face they got that right im not saying anythingi have nothing to say does this angel have a tattoobehind his right shoulder yeah its a bird or something now im saying somethingyou saw him naked  angels been around for a while not long for a vampire 240 years or so angelus leaves ireland wreaks havoc in europe for several decades and then about 80 years agothe most curious thing happens he comes to americashuns other vampires and lives alone theres no no record of him hunting here so he is a good vampirei mean on a scale of one to ten ten being someonewhos killing and maiming every night and one being someone whos not i say that theres no record but vampireshunt and kill its what they do  fish swim birds fly he couldve fed on me he didnt question 100 years or so before he cameto our shores what was he like then like all of them a vicious violent animal dont think im not gratefulyou letting me kill the three how can my children learnif i do everything for them  youve gotta let me take care of the slayer youre giving me orders now ok well just do nothingwhile she takes us out one by one do i sense a plan darla share  angel kills her and comes back to the fold angel he was the most vicious creature i ever met  i miss him so do i  why would he kill her if he feels for her to keep her from killing him you see how we all work togetherfor the common good thats how a family is supposed to function ok so lets reviewreconstruction began when buffy reconstruction reconstruction beganafter the construction which was shoddyso they had to reconstruct after the destruction of the civil war right civil war during which angelwas already 100 and change are we gonna talk about boysor are we gonna help you pass history sometimes i have this fantasy that xandersgonna grab me and kiss me right on the lips if you want xander speak up girl no no speaking up that way leadsto madness and sweaty palms ok so heres something i gotta know when angel kissed youi mean before he turned into how was it unbelievable and it is kinda novel howhell stay young and handsome for ever although youll still get wrinklyand die and what about the children  ill be quiet now no its ok i need to hear thisi need to get over him so i can so that you can like xander said im the slayerand hes a vampire god i cant hes never done anything to hurt meok i need to stop thinking about this ok give it another half an hourand maybe something will sink in then im going homefor some major moping ok the era of the congressionalreconstruction usually called radical  hello hi im darla  a friend of buffys nice to meet you she didnt mention anythingabout me coming over for a study date no i thought she was studying with willow she is willows the civil war expert i was supposed to help herwith the war of

ambulance1630 robello drive my mother cut herself she lost a lot of bloodplease please hurry  mom buffy  my god what happened angel  do you remember anything mom just your friend came over  i was

librarian from your schoolwhats he doing here i just came to pay my respectswish you a speedy recovery boy the teachers really do care in this town get some rest now shes gonna be ok they gave her some iron her blood count was a little a little lowit presents itself like mild anaemia you were lucky you got to heras soon as you did lucky stupid  buff its not your fault no i invited him into my home even after i knew who and what he wasand i didnt do anything about it because i had feelings for himbecause i cared about him if you care about somebody you careabout them you cant change that by killing them maybe not but i think its a start  well keep an eye on your mom buffy you cant stop me the three found menear the bronze so did he he lives nearby this is no ordinary vampireif there is such a thing now he knows you hes faced the threei think this is gonna take more than a stake so do i shes out hunting you right nowshe wants to kill you  leave me alone what did you think did you think she would understand that she would look at your faceyour true face and give you a kiss for 100 yearsyouve not had a moments peace because you will not accept who you arethats all you have to do accept it dont let her hunt you down dont whimperand mewl like a mangy human kill feed live all right  what do you want i want it finished thats good youre hurting me thats good too she talks about you all the timeits important teachers make an impression she makes quite an impression herself i know shes having trouble with history is it too difficult for heror is she not applying herself she lives very much in the now history of course is very muchabout then but theres no reason shes studying with willowshes studying with darla she is trying darla i dont believe i know her friend who came

do it that school is amazing we have a problem i know youre there and i know what you are  do you im just an animal right youre not an animal animals i like lets get it done come on dont go soft on me now  a little wide why why didnt you just attack mewhen you had the chance was it ajoke to make me feel for you and then ive killed a lot of vampiresive never hated one before it feels good doesnt it it feels simple i invited you into my homeand you attacked my family why not i killed mine i killed their friends and their friends children for 100 years i offered an ugly deathto everyone i met and i did it with a song in my heart  what changed i fed on a girl about your age beautiful dumb as a postbut a favourite among her clan  her clan the romany gypsies the elders conjured the perfectpunishment for me they restored my soul they were out of boils and blinding torment when you become a vampirethe demon takes your body but not your soul thats gone no conscience no remorseits an easy way to live you have no idea what its liketo have done the things ive done and to care i havent fed on a living human beingsince that day so you started with my mom  i didnt bite her why didnt you say something but i wanted to i can walk like a man but im not one i wanted to kill you tonight go ahead not as easy as it looks sure it is  were near the bronze what now keep looking for her i have a questionwhat if shes fighting angel and his friends what the heck are we gonna do about it do you knowwhat the saddest thing in the world is  bad hair on top of that outfit to love someone who used to love you you guys were involved for several generations youve been around since columbusyou are bound to pile up a few exs youre older than him rightyou are looking a little worn around the eyes i made him there was a time whenwe shared everything wasnt there angelus you had a chance to come home to rulewith me in the masters court for 1000 years but you threw that away because of heryou love someone who hates us youre sick and youll always be sick and youll always rememberwhat it was like to watch her die  you dont think i came alone do you i know i didnt scary scarier dont worry bullets cant kill vampiresit can hurt them like hell but did you just hear so many body parts so few bullets lets begin with the kneecapsno fun dancing without them close but no heart we need to distract her fast buffy angel didnt attack your momit was darla come on buffy take it like a man angel forget her how dare you she was my favourite for 400 years she was weak we dont need her ill bring you the slayer but to lose her to angel he was to have satat my right hand come the day  and now theyre all against you but soon you shall rise and when you do well kill them all the postfumigation party hows it differentto the prefumigation party much hardier cockroaches so no word from angel i swear though in his wayi feel like hes still watching me well in a way he sort of isin the way of that hes right over there i dont need to watchbecause im not threatened im just gonna look this way i just wanted to see if you were okand your mother were both good you if i can go a while without getting shotor stabbed ill be all right  look this cant ever be anything i know for one thingyoure 224 years older than i am i just gotta i gotta walk away from this i know me too one of us
