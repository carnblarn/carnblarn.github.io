my date  all right im in  i said date  so buffys party  maana  well just because shes miss savetheworld and everything  you have to make a big deal i have to cook and everything   youre cooking  im chipsanddips girl  huh horrors all that opening and stirring   and shopping and carrying  well then you should have a person  who does such things for you  well thats what ive been saying to my father but does he listen  um so uh  youre going and and and im going   should we maybe go  why  i dont know this thing with us despite our better judgement  keeps happening maybe we should just admit were dating  groping in a broom closet isnt dating you dont call it a date   until the guy spends money  fine ill spend then well grope  whatever i just think its some kind of whacked  that we feel we have to hide it from all our friends  well of course you wanna tell everybody you have nothing to be ashamed of  i on the other hand have everything to be ashamed of  you know what enough said forget it  must have been my multiplepersonality guy talking  i call him idiot jed glutton for punishment  oh good morning is everything in order for the party  absolutely you ready to get down you funky party weasel  here comes buffy now remember discretion is the better part of valor  you couldve just said sh god are all you brits such drama queens  buffy i feel a prebirthday spankin comin on  id curb that impulse if i were you xander  check cancel spanking   you all right buffy you seem fatigued  rough night  i had a dream that drusilla was alive and she killed angel  it just really freaked me out   you fear it was more of a a a portent  see i dont know  i dont wanna start a big freakout over nothing  still best to be uh on the alert  if drusilla is alive then it could be a fairly cataclysmic state of affairs  again so many words couldnt you just say wed be in trouble   go to class xander  gone  notice the economy of phrasing gone its simple direct   maybe i should get gone too  dont worry unduly buffy  im sure its nothing  i know i should keep my slayer cool but  its angel which automatically equals maxiwig  i have your package  just put it on the table near the other gifts  are you dead set on this pet  wouldnt you rather have your party in vienna  but the invitations are sent  yeah but its just ive had it with this place  nothing ever comes off like its supposed to  my gatherings are always perfect  remember spain  hey the bulls  i remember sweet  but sunnydales cursed for us angel and the slayer see to that  shh ive got good games for everyone  youll see  these flowers are wrong  theyre all wrong  i cant abide them  lets try something different with the flowers then  can i open one  can i  can i  just a peek love  theyre for the party  do you like it baby  it reeks of death  this will be the best party ever  whys that  because  it will be the last  mall trip for your birthday on saturday dont forget  space on a momsponsored shopping opportunity not likely   so does 17 feel any different than 16  its funny you should ask that  you know i woke up feeling more responsible mature and levelheaded  really its uncanny  i now possess the qualities one looks for in a   licensed driver  buffy  you said wed talk about it again when i was 17  do you really think youre ready buffy  jenny calendar   you startled me  you look well  yes im fine  i know i havent written as much lately ive been busy  i cannot imagine what is so important  to make you ignore the responsibility to your people   well ive been working and  the elder woman has been reading signs   something is different  nothing has changed   the curse still holds  the elder woman is never wrong  she says his pain is lessening she can feel it   there is  there is what   a girl  what   how could you let this happen  i promise you  angel still suffers  and he makes amends for his evil he even saved my life  so you just forget  that he destroyed the most beloved daughter of your tribe  that he killed every man woman and child that touched her life  vengeance demands that his pain be eternal as ours is  if this this girl gives him one minute of happiness it is one minute too much   im sorry i thought  you thought what  you thought you are jenny calendar now  you are still janna of the kalderash people   a gypsy  i know uncle  i know  then prove it  your time for watching is past  the girl and him it ends now  do what you must to take her from him  i will see to it  and then my mom broke the plate  it was just like my dream every gesture every word  it was so creepy  yes well id imagine it would be fairly unnerving  hey its the woman of the hour  its happy birthday buffy  not happy birthday buffy  iits just that um part of the nightmare  that buffy had the other night actually transpired  which means drusilla might still be alive  giles in my dream i couldnt stop her she blindsided me  angel was gone before i knew what happened  even if she is alive we can still protect angel  dreams arent prophecies buffy  you dreamt that the master had risen but you stopped it from happening   you ground his bones to make your bread  thats true except for the bread part  ok so fine were one step ahead but i wanna stay that way  absolutely let me read up on drusilla see if she has any particular patterns  why dont you meet me here at seven well map out a strategy   what am i supposed to do until then  go to classes do your homework  have supper  right be that buffy  well thats not a perky birthday puppy  so much for our surprise party i bought little hats and everything  oh well i guess ill tell cordelia  no you wont were having a party tonight  looks like mr caution man but the sound he makes is funny  buffys surprise party will go ahead as we planned  except i wont be wearing a little hat   but buffy and angel  may well be in danger  as they have been before and i imagine will be again  one thing ive learned in my tenure here on the hellmouth  is that there is no good time to relax  but buffys turning 17 just this once and she deserves a party  youre a great man of our time  and anyway angels coming so shell be able to protect him and have cake  precisely   buffy  oh my god i didnt see you there  sorry um giles wanted me to tell you that theres been a change of plans  uh he wants to meet you someplace near his house  i guess he had to run home to get a book or something  cause heaven knows there arent enough books in the library   uh hes very thorough  oh which is not to bag  its kind of manly in an obsessive compulsive kind of way dont you think  mmhm um you know my cars here why dont i drive you  ok   are we going to the bronze  im not sure  giles gave me an address im just following his directions  this looks funky stop for a sec   no buffy maybe you shouldnt  sorry sacred duty yaddayaddayadda  what is this  every time i see you youre stealing something  you really should speak with someone about this klepto issue   where is she  shh i think i hear her coming  surprise  that pretty much sums it up   buffy are you ok  yes what happened  uh there were these vamps outs whats going on  oh erm  surprise party  happy birthday  you guys did all this for me   that is so sweet  are you sure youre ok  yes im fine  are you ok  yeah hey did everybody see that guy just turn to dust  uh well uh sort of  yep vampires are real a lot of em live in sunnydale  willow will fill you in   i know its hard to accept at first  actually it explains a lot  hey somebody give me a hand here   those creeps left this behind  what is it  ive no idea ccan it be opened  yeah theres a secure release right here  well clearly the hellmouths answer to  what do you get the slayer who has everything   good heavens buffy are you all right  man that thing had major grip   wwhat was that  it looked like an arm  it cant be she wouldnt  what a vamps version of snakes in a can or do you care to share   angel  its a legend way before my time  of a demon brought forth to rid the earth of the plague of humanity  to separate the righteous from the wicked  and to burn the righteous down   they called him the judge  the judge this is he   not all of him  im still needing backstory here  erm he he couldnt be killed yes  erm an army was sent against him  most of them died but finally  they were able to dismember him but not kill him  the pieces were scattered buried in every corner of the earth  so all these parts are being brought here  by drusilla   the vamps outside were spikes men  shes just crazy enough to do it   do what reassemble the judge  bring forth armageddon   is anybody else gonna have cake  we need to get this out of town   angel  what  you have to do it youre the only one that can protect this thing   what about me  what  youre just gonna skip town for a few months   months  shes right i gotta get this   to the remotest region possible  but thats not months  i can catch a cargo ship to asia and maybe a truck to nepal  you know those newfangled flying machines really are much safer than they used to be  i cant fly theres no sure way to guard against the daylight  i dont like this any more than you do buffy  but theres no other choice  when  tonight  as soon as possible  but its my birthday  ill drive you to the docks  you lost it  you lost my present  i know im sorry  its a bad turn man she cant have her fun without the box  the slayer she came out of nowhere i didnt even see her she   make a wish  what  im going to blow out the candles  you might give him a chance to find your lost treasure  he is a wanker but hes the only one weve got with half a brain  if he fails you can eat his eyes out of the sockets for all i care  ill get it please  i swear  ok  hurry back then  i should go the rest of the way alone  ok  but ill be back i will  when six months a year  you dont know how long its gonna take or if well even  hey  if well even what  well if you havent noticed someone pretty much always wants us dead  dont say that well be fine  we dont know that  we cant know buffy nobody can thats just the deal  i have somethin for you for your birthday  i was gonna give it to you earlier but  its beautiful  my people before i was changed they exchanged this as a sign of devotion  its a claddagh ring  the hands represent friendship the crown represents loyalty  and the heart  well you know  wear it with the heart pointing towards you  it means you belong to somebody  like this  put it on   i dont wanna do this  me either  so dont go  buffy  i  angel the box  you  buffy  they should be back by now  maybe buffy needed a few minutes to pull herself together  poor buffy on her birthday and everything  its sad granted but lets look at the upside for a moment  i mean what kind of a future would sheve really had with him  shes got two jobs  dennys waitress by day slayer by night  and angels always in front of the tv with a big blood belly  hes dreamin of the glory days when buffy still thought  this whole creatureofthenight routine was a big turnon  youve thought way too much about this  no no thats just the beginning have i told you the part  where i fly into town in my private jet and take buffy out for prime rib   xander  and she cries  what happened  drus guys ambushed us they got the box   wheres jenny  uh she took angel to get clothing   ii had some here  and we needed clothes because  we got wet   giles what do we know  the more i study the judge  the less i like him his touch can literally burn the humanity out of you  a true creature of evil can survive the process no human ever has  whats the problem we send cordy to fight this guy and we go for pizza  can this guy be stopped without an army  erm no weapon forged can kill him not very encouraging  if we could only stop them from assembling him  we need to find his weak spots and we need to figure out where theyd be keeping him   this could take time  better do a round robin   xander you go first  good call   round robin  its when everybody calls  everybody elses mom and tells them theyre staying at everyones house  thus freeing us up for world saveage  and allnight keggers  what only xander gets to make dumb jokes  mom hi xander yeah uh  willow and i are gonna be studying all night long so im not gonna be  i think i read this already  i cant get over how cool oz was about all this  gee im over it  youre just jealous cause you didnt have a date for the party  no i sure didnt  angel any luck  it seems buffy needed some rest  yeah she hasnt been sleeping well tossing and turning  she told me cause of her dreams  now now  hands off my presents  no   angel  buffy its ok  im here im right here  more music   transylvanian concubine by rasputina   if you want to know how to fly

to be countess in their hearts and their   look what i have for you ducks  minds that have to whisper   see in them a sister look into their eyes and youll become   transylvanian concubine the best is saved for last   you know what flows there like wine   sorrow is their master cackling with laughter   now hes having just one piece of   cakey is their makeup catholics try to shake up  hes perfect

need a plan  ii know youre concerned buffy but you cant just go off halfcocked  i have a plan angel and i go to the factory and do recon  figure out how far theyve gotten assembling the judge  you guys check any places the boxes could be coming into town   shipping yards airports anything  we need to stop them from getting all the boxes in one place  yes yes well actually thats quite a good plan  this thing is nasty and its real giles we cant wait for it to come get us  right  i saw this the party  what what is it  we gotta get outta here  well well look what we have here  crashers  im sure our invitations just got lost in the mail  its delicious i only dreamed youd come   leave her alone  yeah thatll work  now say pretty please   the girl  chilling isnt it  shes so full of good intention   take me take me instead of her  no  uh youre not clear on the concept pal there is no instead   just first and second  and if you go first  you dont get to watch the slayer die  dont touch him  this way  go  come on we need to get inside   youre shaking like a leaf  im cold  let me get you somethin  put these on get under the covers just to warm up  sorry  what  oh um  its ok i just have a cut or something  can i  let me see  ok  its already closed youre fine  you almost went away today  we both did  angel  i feel like i lost you  youre right though   we cant be sure of anything  shhh  i  you what  i love you  i try not to but i cant stop  me me too  i cant either   buffy maybe we shouldnt  dont  just kiss me  ah buffy  buffy
