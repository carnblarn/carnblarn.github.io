when youre not babblingabout poor willow  you rave about the allpowerful buffy i do not babble i occasionally run on  every now and then i yammer xander look around were in my daddys carits just the two of us there is a beautifulbig full moon outside tonight it doesnt get more romantic than thisso shut up  did you hear that what is it now  i thought i heard something is willow sending a distress signal that only you can hear ok now i know i heard something thats it your mind hasnt been hereall night how about i just drop you off get outta here  i cant find the key we should be movin lets go told ya i heard somethin  youre sure it was a werewolf well lets see um six feet tall claws a big old snoutin the middle of his face like a wolf  yeah im stickin with my first guess seems wise there was that thing where it tried to bite us  it was so awful i know daddy just had this car detailed  so whats the word there were other attacks by a wild dog around town severalanimal carcasses were found mutilated you mean like bunnies and stuffno dont tell me dont worry they might not look itbut bunnies can take care of themselves  yeah yeah yes er fortunately no people were injured  that falls into thats a switch column for now but it will be back next full moon  what about tonights full moon pardon last night was the night before the full moonknown as the night before the full moon so the legend that werewolves only prowlduring a full moon might be erroneous  or it could be a crock unless it was using last years almanac  giles has some schoolin to do yes i must admit im intrigued werewolves its one of the classics im sure my books and i arein for a fascinating afternoon he needs to get a pet sunnydale is becomingmore dangerous all the time a full moon like tonighttends to bring out the crazies but with some simple basicsof selfdefence each of you can learnhow to protect yourself heres a suggestionmove away from the hellmouth tag would you look at that hes all over herpsst hey buddy this is a public forum here i think youve splashed on justa little too much obsession for dorks ok everyone get into your assigned groups  what happened oh last week some huge dog jumpedout of the bushes and bit me ive been there man my cousin jordyjust got his grownup teeth in does not like to be tickled theresa be still my shorts were in the same groupi may have to attack you no actuallyi think in our group there are a few of us and im one of the few dont forget youre supposed to bea meek little girlie girl like the rest of us spoil my fun ok everyone listen up i wanna show youwhat to do if you are attacked from behind in this situation bend forward using your back and shouldersto flip the assailant over to the ground nuh  nuh oh summers you are turnin me on and that works too and while there is no scientific explanationfor the lunar effect on the human psyche the phases of the moon seem to exerta great deal of psychological influence the full moon seems tobring out our darkest qualities and yet ironicallyit led to the invention of the moonpie yes moonpie you see the werewolf is such a potent extreme representationof our inborn animalistic traits it emerges for three consecutive nights thefull moon and the two nights surrounding it  quite the party animal quite and it acts on pure instinct no conscience predatory and aggressive  in other words your typical male on behalf of my gender  hey  lets not jump to conclusions i didnt jump i took a step and there conclusions were the point is that our wolfman could also be awolfwoman or anyone bitten by a werewolf  so im guessing silver bullets are in order no no bullets no matter who this werewolf isits a human being who may be completelyunaware of his or her condition so tonight we bring him back alive  anything yet yes and you wont believe what i saw brittany podelle was making out with owenstadeal but he goes with bara williams if no no sign of the werewolf how about you the same i thought we might knock on a few windowsask if anyones seen the thing yet giles no ones seen anything oh yes no of course not no yes gotcha  what the hell giles giles hey whoa  hands are good right there who are you what are you doing the names kane im the one with the gunwhich means i get to do the interviewing hey before we get all chummy herehow about we do something about this net  are you

little guy gamesits like hes there then hes not there  he wants it but then he doesnt want it hes busy looking at what he doesnt have  and doesnt realise what he does have he should at least realise that you have oz hm im not sure i dooz and i are in some sort of holding pattern except without the holdingor anything else whats he waiting for whats his problemoh thats right hes a guy  yeah him and xander guys who do they think they are couple of guys  looks as though your hunch was right who could resist our house of hormones  the werewolf its in there comin through  you let it get away i didnt let it do anything  i had the chain around its neck chain  were you gonna take it for a walk i was going to lock it up thats beautiful this is what happenswhen a woman tries to do a mans job now you

going to be on your pretty little head  i hope you can live with that i live with that every day first they tell me i canthunt an elephant for its ivory now ive gotta deal with people forthe ethical treatment of werewolves pillock right lets move out giles giles i didnt see you there  i thought something had happened oh no im im ok im just erm fine er just im er ok er any sign of the werewolf no i guess you didnt see anything fromthe vantage point of having your eyes closed  its going to be light soon so we wait police say that the incident wasconnected to the animal mutilation which occurred two nights agothe coroners office identified the body as that of sunnydale high schoolstudent theresa klussmeyer age 17 buffy were gonna get this thingwe have another whole night theres nothing more

it well we have one more night  another night oh yeah believe me im gonna givethat wolfie somethin to howl about but while were doing nothing theres ahuman werewolf out there making fun of us the way werewolves always do  but theres really no way to tell who it is oh sure there is giles knows stuff andim practically an expert on account of once you were a hyena i know what its like to cravethe taste of freshlykilled meat to be taken over bythose uncontrollable urges you said you didnt rememberanything about that i said i didnt remember anything about that look the point is that i have an affinitywith this thing i can get inside of its head im a big bad wolf im on the prowl im sniffin im snarlinim a slobbering predator im wait a second its right in front of us its obvious who i am im larry the guys practically gotwolf boy stamped on his forehead you got the dog bite you got the aggressionnot to mention excessive back hair and he was gleefulabout tormenting theresa  still that doesnt necessarily mean im gonna talk to him  gonna force a confession outta him good go in the meantimewe need to cover our bases willow check the student filessee if anybody else fits the profile  buffy where are we going if none of that worksi think i may have an alternative yeah me and the werewolf alone ina cage for three minutes thats all i ask  are you ok what  you kind of knew theresa oh yeah i uh im tryin not to think about it its  its a lot it is but we can do stuff to helpsometimes it feels good to help well like looking up stuff im gonna be doing that most of the nightyou could help me help together i cant um uh im busy oh so i i gotta go harris jeesh next time wear a bell why so jumpy larry  geeks make me nervous is that really it or is there something youre hiding i could hide my fist in your face i know your secret big guyi know what you been doin at night you know harris that nosey little nose ofyours is gonna get you into trouble someday  like today hurting me isnt gonna make this go away people are still gonna find out all right what do you wanthush money is that what youre after  i dont want anything i just wanna help what you think you have a cure no its just i know what youregoin through because ive been there  thats why i know you should talk about it thats easy for you to say i mean youre nobodyive got a reputation here  larry please before someone else is hurt look if this gets out its over for me i mean forget about playin footballtheyll run me out of this town i mean come on how are people gonnalook at me after they find out im gay wow i said it and it felt ok im gay i am gay  i heard you the first time i cant believe it it was almost easy ive never felt i could tell anyone and then you you of all peopleyou bring it out of me it probably woulda slipped outeven if i wasnt here no because knowing you went through thesame thing made it easier for me to admit  the same thing its ironic all those times i beat the crap outta you it must have been becausei recognised something in you that i didnt wanna believe about myself  larry no i am not of course of course not dont worry i wouldnt do that to you your secrets safe with me oh wow so whats the scuttlebutt anybodybesides larry fit our werewolf profile there is one name that keeps getting spit out aggressive behaviourrunins with authorities  about a screenful of violent incidents ok most of those were not my fault they started em i stood up for myself its good to count to ten when youre angry one two  three ill keep looking i um noticed you were lookin solo yeah oz wanted to be someplace that was away from me  im sorry i cant figure him out i mean hes so hot and coldor lukewarm and cold welcome to the mystery that is menit goes something like they grow body hair and loseall ability to tell you what they want that doesnt seem like a fair trade well if you want to up the speed quotientwith oz you need to do something daring maybe you need to make the first move  that wont make me a slut i think your reputation will remain intact it used to be easy to tell if a boy liked you hed punch you on the armand then run back to his friends  those were the days hey ill see you guys later cordelia asked me tolook at her history homework before class i think that means i might have to do it wow those two gals are hanging out a lottogether thisd be a good time to panic  so howd it go with larry whats that supposed to mean  howd it go with larry hes not the werewolf cant we just leave it at thatmust you continue to push and push  sorry i was just wondering hes not  ok ok but there goes our lead suspectwhich then puts us back at square boned youre not boned youre buffy eradicator of evildefender of things that need defending tell that to theresa she could have used mydefending before she was ripped apart by a werewolf nowhere in any of the reports did itsay anything about her being mauled they were linked to the animal attacksso we assumed werewolf what else should we assume vampire so thats good right in the senseof the werewolf didnt get her and no there is no good here no good instead of not protectingtheresa from the werewolf i was able to not protect herfrom something just as bad she had a lot of friends buffy you cant blame yourselffor every death in sunnydale if it werent for youpeopled be lined up to get buried willow would be robbie the robotslove slave i wouldnt have a head and theresas a vampire angel sends his love angel are you ok this isnt happening  hes gonna keep coming after me dont let him get to you hes not the same guy you knew oh no my lifes not too complicated  willow what are you doing here i had this whole thing worked out i wrote it down but it didnt makeany sense when i read it back  willow this is not a very good time what am i supposed to think first you buy me popcornand then youre all glad that i didnt get bit and you put the tag back in my shirtbut i guess none of that means anything because instead of looking up names withme youre alone doing nothing by yourself  willow well talk about this tomorrow no dammit well talk about this now buffy said that what a girl makeshas to be the first move and now im starting to thinkthe written version sounded good  but you know what i mean i know i know its me im going through some changes well welcome to the world things happendont you think im going through a lot  not like me oh what so now youre special youre special boy with chains and stuff why do you have chains and stuff willow please get outta here oz oz what is it whats wrong there you are sorry im late i had to do someunscheduled slayage in the form of theresa  shes a vampire was angel sent her as a token of affection  buffy im so sorry not now giles we can all have ourselves a good cryafter we bag us a werewolf  all set lets go find this thing one question how do we find this thing its oz its oz  whats oz the werewolf  are you certain just trust me on this he said he was going through all thesechanges then he went through changes  where is he in the woods  lets go go where youre not gonna kill oz  hes a werewolf but he doesnt mean to be were not gonna hurt him weve put enough phenobarbital in thisto sink a small elephant or a large werewolf thats it let me see you come on suppertime good doggy now play dead careful dammit i shot oz you saved us no wonder this townsoverrun with monsters  no one heres man enough to kill em i wouldnt be too sure of that how about you let the door hit youin the ass on the way outta town is he gonna be ok hell be a little sore in the morningbut hell be oz this is all so weird how are wesupposed to act when we see him its gotta be weird for him toonow that we know so much i know well neverlook at him the same again  hes still a human being most of the time who are we talking about  oz who are you talking about no one here let me get those hey xander look about what you did  i owe you what did you do its really nothingwe should be talking about ever i know i know its just well thanks  that was weird its not ok for one guy to like another guy just because he was in the locker roomwith him and nothing happened dont push  i meant he didnt try to look up my skirt oh yeah thats the weirdness weirdness abounds latelymaybe its the moon  it does stuff to people ive heard that itll put a strain onwillow and ozs relationship what relationshipwhat life could they possibly have together obedience school papertraining oz is always in the back burying thingsthat breed can turn on its owner  i dont know i see oz as the loyal type shes not safe with him if it were up to me xander its not up to you  hey hey did you wanna go first i spoke to giles he said ill be ok i haveto lock myself up around the full moon only he used more wordsthan that and a globe im sorry about how all this ended upwith me shooting you an all its ok im sorry i almost ate you its ok  i kinda thought you would have told me i didnt know what to say its not every day you find out yourea werewolf thats fairly freaksome  it may take a couple of days getting used to yeah its a complication so maybe itd be best if i just sorta what
