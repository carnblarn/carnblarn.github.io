                thats right big boy  come and get it  i got him go  anytime now  hes getting away and ow  that really never works   are you guys all right  first of all  what was with the acrobatics how did that happen  wasnt andy hoelich on the gymnastics team  thats right he was  cheater  ok and the uh second problem im having   come and get it big boy  well  well the slayer always says a pun  or a witty play on words and i think it throws the vampires off  and and it makes em frightened because im wise cracking ok  i didnt really have a chance to work on that one but you try it every time  if i may suggest this time its personal  i mean theres a reason why its a classic  ive always been amazed with how buffy fought but  in a way i feel like we took her punning for granted  xander past tense rule  oh sorry i just meant we in the past took it for granted and um  we wont when she gets back  do you think buffy knows schools starting tomorrow  tomorrow  right big day  oh im gonna be busy a lot  but but only till three and thats when you usually get up  i cant wait to see cordelia  i cant believe i cant wait to see cordelia  i wonder what our first homework assignments gonna be  hey youre excited over cordelia ok  weve all got issues  i guess we should pack it in  yeah  wouldnt it be great if buffy just showed up tomorrow  like nothing happened  she cant just show up she got kicked out  well yeah i know i just wish  i wish we knew where she was  how did you find me here  if i was blind i would see you   stay with me  forever  thats the whole point  ill never leave  not even if you kill me anne  anything else   thatll do us peaches  pay at the counter  sure you dont want me to work it off for ya   you guys ready  yeah i think were good  um anne   whatll you have  well ok  what can we get with this   um  can we get cake  dont be stupid we gotta eat healthy we cant have cake   can we get pie  weve got a peach pie  i cant guarantee theres a peach in it  we shouldnt have blown all our money  come on it was worth it  hey check this out  its nice  its nice and uh permanent  yeah forever  i mean thats the whole point   hey do i know you  i dont think so   really where are you from  ill get your pie  im not feeling great think you can cover for me  sure ok   so no joy at the cemetery  no he got away  we still have some glitches in the system like  vampires getting away but i think were improving  for gods sake be careful  i mean uh i appreciate your efforts to keep the vampire population down  until buffy returns but uh  well if anything should happen to you or  you should be killed i should take it somewhat amiss  youd be cranky   entirely  well we try not to get killed  thats part of our whole mission statement   dont get killed  good  i think youre gonna love that one   hi  hey willow   how was your summer  i cant believe you brought that up  las palmas was the nightmare resort  they order you around and make you have organized fun

little weird   so the cute thing is out  have you guys seen cordelia  yeah shes around here somewhere  i dont wanna come on too geeky but uh ok im psyched  theres gonna be some heat if you know what i

rock  its all about egg whites if we can focus keep discipline  and not have quite as many mysterious deaths sunnydale is gonna rule  im trying to get to cute really  but im still sorta stuck on strange  well id be willing to bargain down to eccentric with an option on cool   hey  hey   good summer  it was all right  cool  yeah  well ill see ya  yeah whatever  hey how are you can i talk to

not just interested in feeding the body  you might find something youre missing  im all right  then why are you here  this is not a good place for a kid to be  you get old fast here  the thing that drains the life out of them is despair  i mean kids come here and they got nothing to go home to and  this ends up being the last stop for a lot of them  shouldnt have to be that way  back to freedom

what shes doin  gabbing to all of her friends about her passionate affair  with pedro the cabana boy  laughing about me thinking how she still might have feelings about me  oh its possible youre talking about buffy  its possible  the bronze just never seems the same without her  yeah and the slaying isnt getting any easier either  i dont know i think were kinda getting a rhythm down  were losing half the vamps  yeah but rhythmically  we just need to work on our timing i think   no i know what we need  a vampire slayer  next best thing  bait   uh hello  hello um may i  oh of course come on in  ive uh just come back from oakland a friend of mine called with a lead  stories about someone fighting vampires it uh didnt pan out im afraid   no buffy  no vampires  bunch of school kids in heavy mascara listening to extremely silly music  well thank you for going  i can hardly uh  i can hardly leave the house  im just afraid shell call and shell need my help  buffy is the most capable child ive ever known  i mean she may be confused unhappy but uh  i honestly believe shes in no danger  i just wish i could talk to her  the last thing we did was fight  joyce you mustnt blame yourself for her leaving  i dont  i blame you  youve been this huge influence on her guiding her  you had this whole relationship with her behind my back  i feel like youve taken her away from me  i didnt make buffy who she is  and who exactly is she  buff um anne can i talk to you  look this isnt a good time   can it wait  rickies gone  i havent seen him for more than a day hes never left for that long  i think somethings happened maybe somethings happened  did you call the police  rickie skipped out on his parole  uh they would just cause more trouble  i dont know did you did you ask around  can you help me  uh ii cant  but thats who you are and stuff right i mean  you help people and you know  i cant get into this im sorry lily  you you know how to do stuff  i dont not any more  but i dont know

rickie t we come in sometimes  rickie sure uh hes not here  well do you know if hes been in in the last day or so  let me check the sheet  thisll probably go faster if we split up  can i come with you

care of me  im sorry  were gonna get a place  his cousin can get him a job at the car wash  lily theres theres something else  the the person that i found   was old he he looked about 80  well thats not rickie  im sure it was  i i dont know how but  it was like something drained the life out of him   do you mean like a vampire  no  a vampire couldnt accelerate the aging process uh  maybe it was something in his blood  when was the last time you guys gave blood together  i dont understand maybe its not rickie ok  lily this is something youre just gonna have to deal with  but he didnt do anything wrong why would this happen to him  thats not the point  these things happen all the time you cant just  close your eyes and hope that theyre gonna go away  is it cause of you  what  you know about monsters and stuff  you couldve brought this with you  i didnt bring anything with me  and i didnt ask for you to come to me with your problems  i just wanted to be left alone  if you cant deal then dont lay it off on me  are you ok  hey its ok  maybe i can help  you cant  look i know you all think im a big square  handing out leaflets about hope  but hope is a real thing just like despair  and hope can fill up a part of you thats missing  but rickie is  rickie say are you lily  right right he was talking about you   youve seen rickie  oh sure  rickies with us now  she said he was dead  well someone sure handed you a tall tale  rickies no more dead than i am  why dont you come to family home well get you taken care of  candidate for what  what are you doing  breaking into your office

getting yourself in a lot of trouble  i dont want any trouble  i just wanna be alone and quiet in a room with a  chair and a fireplace and a tea cozy  i dont even know what a tea cozy is but i want one  instead i keep getting trouble which i am more than willing to share  what are you doing with these kids  nothing  i just  i give him the names of the healthy ones  give them to who  well dont you look nice  i guess  well you dont wanna wear your own outfit to the cleansing  itll get soaked  a cleansing is like a baptism right   not quite the same will i see rickie after  oh of course hes waiting for you hes very excited  why do i have to be bait im always bait   why cant willow be bait  hes already seen willow  and could you complain louder so that all the vampires leave  i think this

relationship  oh thats right i forgot  we actually wanna bury that piece of the past dont we  we come to this station to wash away the past  go ahead kneel  we let the water run over the sin  and the pain and the uncertainty  it looks kinda dirty  you know i just i woke up and i looked in the mirror and i thought  hey whats with all the sin  i need to change im  im dirty im im bad with the  sex and the envy and that  that loud music us kids listen to nowadays w  oh i just suck at undercover  wheres ken  this is a private moment   if you could just  how do you make them old ken  do you feed

you like it  youre never leaving  let me just ask you one thing how long did it take you to forget me  were you still taxiing down the runway or was it actually in the cab  oh yeah mr faithful  you probably met up with some hot little inca mummy girl  yeah i heard about her  help  xander  lily  i always knew i would come here  sooner or later   i knew i belonged here  where   hell  this isnt hell  isnt it  what is hell but the total absence of hope  the substance the tactile proof of despair  youre right lily this is where youve been heading all your life  just like rickie   rickie  he forgot you  well it took him a long time  he remembered your name years after hed forgotten his own   but in the end  years but  oh uh interesting thing  time moves more quickly here than in your reality  a hundred long years will pass here on earth its just a day  so you just work us till were too old  and spit us back out  thats the plan  you see lily  youll die of old age before anyone wonders where you went  not that anyone will thats why we chose you   you didnt choose me  no  but i know you  anne  so afraid  so pathetically determined to run away  from whatever it is you used to be  to disappear  congratulations  you got your wish  you work and you live that is all  you do not complain or laugh or do anything besides work  whatever you thought whatever you were does not
