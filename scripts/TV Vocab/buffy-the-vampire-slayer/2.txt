                no get off hey xander  xander are you ok man something hit me  wheres jesse i dont know they surrounded us  that girl took off with him which way i dont know jesse this world is older than any of you know contrary to popular mythologyit did not begin as a paradise for untold aeons demons walked the earth they made it their home their uh their hell but in timethey lost their purchase on this reality the way was made for mortal animalsfor man all that remains of the old ones are vestiges certain magics certain creatures  and vampires this is where i have a problem see because were talking about vampireswere having a talk with vampires in it  isnt that what we saw last night no those werent vampires those were just guys in need of a facial or maybe they had rabies and that guy turning to dustjust a trick of light thats what i said the first timei saw a vampire well after i was donewith the screaming part  oh i need to sit down you are sitting down  oh good for me so vampires are demons the books tell that the last demonto leave this reality fed off a human mixed their bloodhe was a human form possessed infected by the demons soul he bit another and anotherand so they walked the earth feeding killing some mixing their bloodwith others to make more of their kind waiting for the animals to die outand the old ones to return move is this for me an offering master hes a good one his blood is pure youve tasted it im your faithful dog you bring me scraps i didnt mean i have waitedfor three score years i have waited while you come and go i am stuck here here in this house of worship my ascension is almost at hand pray that when it comes im in a better mood master forgive me we had more offeringsbut there was trouble a girl and there was a girl she fought well and she knew of our breed  it is possible that she may be a slayer  a what for as long as there have been vampires theres been the slayerone girl in all the world  he loves doing this part all right the slayer hunts vampiresbuffy is a slayer dont tell anyone  thats all the vampire information you need except how you kill them you dont i do  jesses my my responsibility i let him get taken thats not true if you hadnt shown up they would havetaken us too anybody mind if i pass out  breathe breathe breathe this big guy lukehe talked about an offering to the master i dont know what or who but if they werentjust feeding jesse may be alive ill find him this may be the dumb questionbut shouldnt we call the police and theyd believe us of course we dont have to say vampireswe could just say theres a a bad man they couldnt handle ittheyd only come with guns you have no idea where they took jesse soon as they got clear of the graveyardthey could have just voom  they can fly they can drive oh i dont remember hearing a car lets take an intuitive leapand say they went underground vampires love sewer systemsyou can go anywhere in the town without catching raysbut i didnt see any access there an electrical tunnelruns under the whole town if we have a diagnostic of the tunnel systemit might indicate a meeting place  we could go to the building commission we so dont have time uh guys there may be another way a slayer have you any proof  only that she fought me and yet lives oh very nearly proof enough i cant remember the last time that happened he caught me sleeping she mustnt be allowedto interfere with the harvest  i would never let that happen dont worry about it i believe shell come to uswe have something she wants if she is a slayer and this boy lives shell try to save him i thought you nothing more than a meal boy congratulationsyouve just been upgraded to bait there it is  that runs under the graveyard i dont see any access so all the city plans are justopen to the public um well in a way i sort of stumbled on to them when i accidentally decryptedthe city councils security system  someones been naughty theres nothing here its useless i think

the spanish who first settled herecalled it boca del infierno roughly translated hellmouth its a sort of umportal between this reality and the next  this vampire hoped to open it bring the demons back  end of the world but he blew it or i mean there was an earthquakethat swallowed half the town and him too you see opening dimensional portalsis a tricky business odds are he got himself stuckrather like a cork in a bottle  and this harvest thing is to get him out it comes once in a century on this night the master can draw powerfrom one of his minions while it feeds enough power to break freeand open the portal the minion is called the vessel and he bears this symbol so i dust anyone sporting that symboland no harvest  simply put yes where is this gettogether being held  there are a number of possibilities theyll go to the bronze  are you sure all those tasty young morsels everywhere  thats where jesses gonna be trust me then we should get there  the sun will be down before long i gotta
