cos of her dreams what if something really happened to him  is she gonna join us here yeah shes just stopping at home first nada did you find anything this book mentions the judgebut nothing useful big scary no weapon forged can stop himtook an army to take him down blah blah blah we need some insight a weak spot well were not gonna find it here  sorry i snapped at you before im reeling from that new experience i was crazed i wasnt thinking i know you were too busy rushing offto die for your beloved buffy  youd never die for me no i might die from you  does that get me any points no  come on cant we just kiss and make up i dont wanna make up but im ok with the other part willow we were just willow willow  willow come on i knew it i knew it well i didnt have the slightest ideabut i knew there was something i didnt know you two were fighting way too muchits not natural  i know its weird weird its against all laws of god and man its cordelia remember the we hate cordelia clubof which you are the treasurer  i was gonna tell you what stopped you could it be shame  lets overreact but willow we were just kissingit doesnt mean that much no it just means that youd rather bewith someone you hate than be with me  angel hey oh my god i was so worried i didnt mean to frighten you  where did you go been around oh my god i was freaking out you just disappeared what i took off but you didnt say anything you just left yeah like i really wantedto stick around after that  what you got a lot to learn about men kiddo although i guess you proved that last night  are you saying lets not make an issue out of it ok in fact lets not talk about it at all  it happened i dont understand was it me was i not good you were great reallyi thought you were a pro how can you say this to me lighten up it was a good timeit doesnt mean we have to make a big deal  it is a big deal its what bells ringing fireworks a dulcet choir of pretty little birdies come on buffyits not like ive never been there before dont touch me i should have knownyou wouldnt be able to handle it angel i love you i love you too ill call you you know what it is this vengeance uncle i have served youi have been faithful i need to know to the modern manvengeance is a word an idea payback one thing for anotherlike commerce not with us vengeance is a living thing it passes through generations it commands it kills you told me to watch angel you told meto keep him from the slayer i tried but there are other factors terrible thingsare happening here that we cannot control we control nothing we are not wizards jana we merely play a part angel could be of help to us he may be the only chancewe have to stop the judge it is too late for that  why the curse angel was meant to suffer not to live as human one moment of true happinessof contentment one moment where the soul that werestored no longer plagues his thoughts and that soul is taken from him then if somehow if if its happened  then angelus is back i hoped to stop it but i realise now it was arranged to be so  buffy loves him and now she will have to kill him unless he kills her firstuncle this is insanity people are going to die yes it is not justice we serve it is vengeance youre a fool were all fools will hey  whered you go home im glad you came backwe cant do this without you lets get this straight i dont understand iti dont wanna understand it you have gross emotional problemsand things are not ok between us but whats happening right nowis more important than that ok  what about the judge where do we stand on a pile of books that say the same thing  let me guess no weapon forged it took an army yeah wheres an army when you need one  what whoa whoa i think im havin a thought yeah yeah thats a thought now im having a plan now im havin a wiggins whats going on  lets get to the library willow  xander angel thank god youre ok did you see buffy yeah whats up with the lights i dont know listen i have an idea forget about

dont do that oh i think i do that  angel hes not angel any more  are you wrong i am angel at last  oh my god i got a message for buffy why dont you give it to me yourself its not really the kind of message you tell it sort of involves findingthe bodies of all your friends  this cant be you we already covered that subject angel there must be some partof you that remembers who you are dream on schoolgirl your boyfriend is dead  youre all gonna join him leave willow alone and deal with me but shes so cute and helplessits really a turnon things are about to get very interesting buffy are you ok buffy and were absolutely certainthat angel has reverted to his former self yeah were all certainanyone not feeling certain here giles you wouldnt have believed him he was so he came here to kill us  what are we gonna do im leaning towards blind panic  rupert dont talk like that the kids im sorry things are bad enough with the judge here angel crossing over to the other sidei wasnt prepared for that none of us were are you ok is there anything i can do i should have known i saw him at the house he was differentthe things he said  what things its private  but you didnt know he had turned bad how did you  what well you knew  you told me to get away from him well i saw his face if only we knew how it happened  what do you mean some event must have triggered it if anyone would know

his team the slayers a basket caseid say weve hit bottom  i have a plan oh no heres a lower place i dont know about angelbut i may have a way to deal with the judge  what do we do i think um i think i may need cordelia for this one  and we may need wheels well my car is  it might have to be bigger no problem ill get oz he has a van good ok  care to let me in on the plan im a part of no  why not because if i tell you then you wont do it just meet me at willows house in halfan hour and wear something trashyer im not sure what we should do about buffy assuming they dont attack tonightwe should
