                this is madness what can you have been thinking you are the slayer lives depend upon you i make allowances for your youth buti expect a certain amount of responsibility instead of whichyou enslave yourself to this cult  you dont like the colour i do you erm do you ignoreeverything i say as a rule no i believe thats your trick i told you im trying outfor the cheerleading squad you have a sacred birthright buffy you were chosen to destroy vampiresnot to wave pompoms at people and as the watcher i forbid it and youll be stopping me how well i by appealing to your common senseif such a creature exists i will still have timeto fight the forces of evil ok i just wanna have a lifei wanna do something normal something safe giles didnt approve huh he totally lost his waterwe havent seen a vampire in over a week  he could get a girlfriend if he wasnt so old were behind you people scoff at things like school spirit butlook at these girls giving their all like this ooh stretchy where was i pretending to see scantily clad girls inrevealing postures as a spiritual experience who said i was pretending  hey heres a goodluck thing for tryouts whats this  whats that oh how sweet yours always it came that way really they all said that just look at that amber  who does she think she is a laker girl i heard she turned them down ok listen up lets begin with amber grove  if youre not auditioning move off the floor amy hi hi i didnt know you wanted to bea cheerleader you lost a lot of weight had to  do you know buffy hi  hi how i hate this let me count the ways she trained with bensonhes one of the best coaches money can buy  they have cheerleading coaches oh yeah dont you have i train with my mom three hours in the morning three at night hm that much quality time with my momwould lead to some quality matricide yeah well i know its hokeybut shes really great what the that girls on fire enough of the hyperbole its ok its ok youre gonna be ok god ive been slaying vampires for over a year and i have seen somepretty cringeworthy things but  nobodys hands ever got toasted before i imagine not  so this isnt a vampire problem no but it is funky right not of the norm quite spontaneous human combustionis rare and scientifically unexplainable there have been cases for hundreds of yearsusually all thats left is a pile of ashes thats all that would have been leftwithout buffy so we have no idea what caused this  thats a comfort thats the thrill of living on the hellmouth theres a veritable cornucopia of fiendsand devils and ghouls to engage pardon me for finding the glass half full any common denominatorsin cases of spontaneous combustion er rage in most cases the person whocombusted was terribly angry or or upset so maybe ambers got this powerto make herself be on fire  its like the human torch only it hurts ill get the skinny on amber find out if shes hadcolourful episodes before that means hacking into the schoolscomputer system something i can do  ill ask around dont get involved what do you mean were a teamarent we a team yeah youre the slayerand were like the slayerettes i just dont like putting you guys in danger i laugh in the face of dangerthen i hide until it goes away ok just walk softlyat least until we know a little more what if amber isnt causing this herself well then we have to determinewho or what did and er deal with it accordingly  hey hi how was school mm a reverentjoy  whats all this its for the tribal art display cool  we had tryouts today oh great howd it go i didnt actually get to try outthere was an accident  fierce competition though i know youll do fine keep on plugginjust have to get back on the horse  mom yeah  what was i trying out for oh uh some activity i have no idea im
