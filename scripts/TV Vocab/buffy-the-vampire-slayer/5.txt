                we havent been introduced im buffy and youre history poor technique prioritising subpar execution was adequate but a bit too bloody for my taste giles dont mention iti was glad to make the world safe again im not saying your methods have no merit but you expend too much time and energyit should simply be plunge and move on hello oh thats great i kill em you fence their stuff  what is it i dont know  but it bothers you yes i i thought this vampire was on a random killbut it may be something else  something big yes id best consult my books and there will be a time of crisis of worlds hanging in the balance and in this time shall come the anointed the masters great warrior and the slayer will not know him will not stop him and he will lead her into hell as it is written so shall it be five will die and from their ashesthe anointed shall rise the brethren of aurelius shall greet him and usher him to his immortal destiny as it is written so shall it be and one of the brethrenshall go out hunting the night before and get himself killed because he couldnt waitto finish his job before he ate oh wait thats not written anywhere the anointed will bemy greatest weapon against the slayer if you fail to bring him to me if you allow that girl to stop you here endeth the lesson that symbol on the ring i believe its the rune for fidelity but it doesnt connect with anyof the sects that ive studied what about this on the insideits a sun and three stars  havent we seen that somewhere let me see no i dont think this represents any wait its right here sun and three stars ugh check these guys out i told you it looked familiar by the order of aurelius yes youre right ooh two points for the slayerwhile the watcher has yet to score oh owen hi  what do you want a book see this is a school and studentscheck out books and then they learn things i was beginning to suspect that was a myth i lost my emily dickinson its dumb but i like her aroundkind of a security blanket i have something like thatwell its an actual blanket and i dont really carry it around any more so emily dickens huh shes great  dickinson shes good also poetry i didnt think id find you here  why not i didnt mean i mean i think you can read oh thanks but you dont seem bookwormy the type of person to lock themselvesin a dark room with a lot of musty old books oh and ive offended you no no im just surprisedyou gave any thought to what im like you shouldnt be oh well i love books i mean i really love books  whats this oh not this one this one she doesnt love oh emily dickinson  were both fans yes shes quite a good poet i mean for a  a girl for an american ill see you in math if i open my eyes at some point cool the order of aureliusis a very old and venerated sect if theyre here its for a good reason  that was owen yes i remember do you have any more copiesof emily dickinson i need one buffy while the fact that you want a bookwould be grounds for a national holiday i think we should focuson the problem at hand right im sorry youre right vampires oh does this outfit make me look fat owen thurman was talking to you its all true wow he hardly talks to anyone hes solitary mysterious he can brood for 40 minutes straightive clocked him he was so nice it was eerie  what did you guys have to talk about emily dickinson he reads emily dickinson hes sensitive yet manly but wait youve never even read her you vixen  any thoughts on what this green stuff is im avoiding the subject i think its kale or possibly string cheese  so buffy howd the slaying go last night xander i mean howd the laying go  no i dont mean that either it went fine thank you theres a new hoitytoityvampire sect in town  thats bad they bring in muchneeded tourist dollars ooh look at mr excitement owen hes all alone maybe somebody should sit with him mm just to be polite good luck ok whatjust happened look an empty seat  let me get that thanks boy cordelias hips are wider than i thought at least you dont have to eatyour soylent green owen a bunch of us are loiteringat the bronze tonight you there  who all is going well im gonna be there  who else you mean besides me  buffy what about you what no no no she uh she doesnt like fun how about we meet there at eight yeah eight there its not a big deal its justa bunch of people getting together  its a very big deal its not it is tell her  im afraid its very big thank you wait what are you talking about  what are you talking about boys im talking about troublea violent prophecy is about to be fulfilled  the order of aurelius you were spoton about the connection ive looked at the writings of aurelius he prophesied that the brethren of his orderwould bring the anointed to the master  whos that i dont know exactly a warrior it says he will risefrom the ashes of the five on the evening of the 1000th dayafter the advent of septus well be ready whenever it is  which is tonight tonight ok  not ok it cant be tonight my calculations are precise theyre bad calculations bad  buffy has a really important date owen ill justjump in my time machinego back to the 12th century and ask the vampires to defer their prophecywhile you take in dinner and a show ok at this point youre abusing sarcasm buffy this is no ordinary vampire we have to stop himbefore he reaches the master but cute guy teenager postpubescent fantasies those will just have to be put on hold the dark forces are aligning against usand we have a chance to beat them back tonight we go into battle  perhaps i miscalculated im thinking yes well you know what they say 90 percentof the vampireslaying game is waiting  you couldnt have told me 90 percent ago weve certainly waited here long enough besides there arent any fresh graveswhos gonna rise apparently no one tonight then i can bail i can goto the bronze and find owen very well follow your hormones if you want but i assume i dont have to warn youabout the hazards of becoming involved with someone whos unawareof your unique condition  yeah i read the back of the box if your identity as a slayer is revealed it could put you and all thosearound you in grave danger well in that case i wont wear my buttonthat says im a slayer ask me how good night five shall die and from their ashesthe anointed shall rise i was sure it was tonight i went on an airplane a pale horse emerged with death as its rider you will be judged you will be judged that days gonna bring fire fire comin down judgment dont think youre readyready to look upon him if theres sin in theretheres sin all around its a liquid on that day there wont be anybodytellin us what to do or why were doin it you cant prepare  on that day you gotta sit down ok are you willing to stand with the righteous is everyone ok are you all right can you move  so you just went home what was i supposed to do say to owen sorry i was in a cemeterywith a librarian waiting for a vampire to rise so i could prevent an evil prophecy or flat tyre i cant take this i feel like everyone isstaring at me the hideous dateless monster what yeah thats right i have no lifenothing to see here pal move it along youre acting a little overly  you could have any guy in school hes

prison ive been trapped here so long ive nearlyforgotten what its like on the surface well therell be time enough to remember when i rule it if she tries to stop you kill her give your own livesbut do not fail to bring the anointed i know you wont disappoint me bug  pick ok do i want to appear shy coy and naive or unrestrained insatiable and aggressive you know owen is a little homespun heprobably wont like that overly assertive look oh hey heres something a nice comfy overcoat and a ski cap the earflaps bring out your eyes maybe i should mixandmatchok guys opinion which do you think owen will like betterthe red or the peach oh you mean for kissing youand telling all his friends youre easy so everyone loses respect for youand talks behind your back  the reds fine thanks ill go with the peach here put this on youre not botherin me  so where is he taking you i dont know where do kids go on dates these days i read somewhere oncethat sometimes they go to movies movies interesting and i saw on tv oncea bunch of people our age went to a party wow i never knew being a teenagerwas so full of possibilities thats owen  thats giles we need to talk  buffys not home my calculations may not have been far off five die in van accident out of the ashes of five shall rise the oneis the prophecy five people have died in a car crash i know it doesnt quite follow but look among the dead was

this is the first date this is my maiden voyage what she doesnt like to dance its too late to do anything about that you should know that buffy doesnt liketo be kissed or even touched  xander in fact dont even look at her we dont know if this is anythingand i havent had a day off for a while and a cranky slayer is a careless slayer buffy maintaininga normal social life as a slayer is problematic at best this is the 90s  the 1990s in point of fact and i can do both clark kent has ajobi just wanna go on a date well i suppose it was a fairly slim lead thank you thank you thank youand i wont go far if the apocalypse comes beep me  is everything cool all set yes and youll face a hefty fine tomorrow well bye dont wait up is something going on probably not no i suppose ill justgo to the funeral home in case just see if anything comes up this is bad i wish it was just bad we should go along yeah youre right i dont trust that owen guyits the eyes theyre crazy xander we should go with gileshe could get in trouble oh hes gone hes gonna be all right hes like super librarian you know everyone forgets willowthat knowledge is the ultimate weapon the thing about emily dickinson i loveis that shes just so incredibly morbid a lot of loss a lot of death it gets me and a lot about bees for some reason did she have a tragic and romantic lifewith a lot of bees quiet kind of sequestered and uneventful which i can really relate toi dont get out much  i dont get that its my fault i just find most girls pretty frivolous i mean theres a lot more important thingsin life than dating you know

heartshe says i may  hes in there go get out shell be ok come on i think hes coming this way oh god this is too much  what have you got what  do you have a stake oh uh  thank you what should i do make

found wanting you killed my date  buffy owens just give her a sec you killed my date your turn does anyone have an aspirin or sixty owen what happened to that guy oh we scared him away  oh good cos you know i wouldve i know here im sure this isnt exactlywhat you had in mind for our first date yeah i was hoping maybewed finish up at ben  jerrys  we still could no i think ill just walk home uh which way is home ill get you there no ill go it alone well make sure he gets home safely  buffy if i might dont did owen say anything about meon the way home you mean specifically about you or generally in the area in the ballpark  any sort of indication in that case no but he was pretty incoherentso we might have missed it  you think no i knew it i totally blew it last night you need a guy who alreadyknows your darkest secrets and still says hey i like that girl  someone like owen well this is our stop hi hi this is going well i dont really know how to say this but  about last night you dont even have to  im sure you were pretty freaked out totally and i was wonderingwhen i could see you again that was my hopeful earcould you repeat that i think youre the coolest  really last night was incredible nearly getting killed made me feel so alive so thats why you want to be with me absolutely when can we dosomething like that again something like like walk downtown at three in the morningand pick a fight in a bar how about tonight tonight would be not a workable thing did i just say that tomorrow im free any night this week im not please dont take this personallyits not you its me right its you and i was kinda hopingthat maybe you and i could still be i get it you just wanna be friends thatd be nice friends yeah great yeah great i was ten years old when my father told mei was destined to be a watcher he was one and his mother before himand i was to be next  were you thrilled beyond all measure no i had very definite plans for my future i was going to be a fighter pilot or possibly a grocer but my father gave me a very tiresomespeech about responsibility and sacrifice sacrifice huh he seems like a nice lad yeah but he wants to be danger man you xander willow you guysknow the score youre careful two days in my worldand owen really would get himself killed or id get him killed or someone else i went to the funeral homeof my own free will  i should have been there buffy  i blew it i have volumes of lore of prophecies of predictions but i dont have an instruction manual we feel our way as we go along and i must say as a slayer youre doing pretty well well i did stop that prophecyfrom coming true you did handily no more anointed one and i would imagine the master whereverhe is having a fairly bad day himself and in this time will come the anointed and the slayer will not know him she will not stop him and he will lead her into hell welcome my friend urgh arghh
