understands your experiment effects of subviolet lightspectrum depravation on the development of fruit fliesthat should do the trick ok im doing this under protest it is not fair they are making participationin the science fair mandatory no one should have to do anythingeducational in school if they dont want to the tomato fruit or vegetable i wanted to do somethingi could finish in a weekend  stop it we are under fluorescent lights the camera loves you i didnt think yearbook nerdscame out of hibernation till spring  its for my private collection eric will you quit it coming through sorry

girl in school who has the coroners officebookmarked as a favourite place sorry to interrupt your undead playgroup buti need willows help on my science project  its a fruit i wouldve asked chris to help me but then that wouldve brought backtoo many memories of daryl i found it meredith todd diedin a car accident last week of course i have learnt to deal with my pain  how was her neck fine except for being broken hello can we deal with my pain please there there it says that meredith and two other girlsin the car were killed instantly they were all on the fondren highpep squad on the way to a game you know what this means fondren might beat sunnydalein the bodycount competition it wasnt vampiressomebody did dig up her corpse eww why is it that every conversationyou have has the word corpse in it we got a body snatcherwhat does that mean heres what ive found demons who eatthe flesh of the dead to absorb their souls or it could obviously bea voodoo practitioner you mean making a zombie uh zombies for most traditional purposesa voodoo priest would require more than one we should see if the other girlsin the accident are awol too we can figure out this creepif we know if he deals in volume  so we dig up some graves tonight oh boy a field trip you gonna call angel  i dont think so yeah why bother him huh ange and i have been never mind as far as hes concerned i have the night off so were set thensay nineish byo shovel and ill pack some foodwho else likes powdered doughnuts  hey cordelia darn i have cheerleader practice tonight i wish i knew youd be digging updead people sooner id have cancelled but if you come across the army of zombiescan you page us before they eat your flesh  xander huh zombies dont eat the flesh of the living yeah i knew thatbut did you see the look on her face i couldnt believe angel he was actingall jealous and he wouldnt even admit it  jealous of what of xander because you did that sexy dance with him  am i ever gonna live that down nope anyway he was being totally irrational  love makes you do the wacky thats the truth this might go fasterif you fems picked up a shovel too  hear hear sorry but im an oldfashioned gal i was raised to believe that men dig upthe corpses and women have the babies speaking of the wacky what was cordeliasriff about painful memories whos daryl daryl epps chriss older brother he was a big football starallstate two years ago he was a running he was a runningsomeone who runs and catches  was he a studly big time all the girls were crazy for him and he broke cordys heartthus possibly proving its existence he died rock climbingor something he fell man thats lousy poor chris ever since then chris has been real quietkind of in his own world their mother doesnt evenleave the house any more i think were there by the way are we hopingto find a body or no body call me an optimist but im hopingto find a fortune in gold doubloons um body would mean flesheating demon no body would point towards the armyof zombies thing take your pick right then go on  youre closer pathetic much move over guys if we dont get this down by tomorrowno ones gonna be led by our cheers  practise ok see you later hello xander harris if this is some kind of joke cordelia this is the last placei expected you to hang out oh god  god its you why were you following me i wasnt sure it was you at first  im looking for buffy buffy well shes uh big shockshes at the graveyard  she said shed be home she lied isnt she a rascal well youre in luckit just so happens that my night is free oh hold on my skirt is caught there both coffins empty makes threegirls signed up for the army of zombies  is it an army if you just have three zombie drill team then youre back  angel xander  angel i thought you took the night off i did but something came up  cordelia told me the truth thats gotta be a first um as long as youre hereperhaps you could be of some help hm we were investigating somebodysbeen digging up the bodies of dead girls i know we found some of them  you mean like two of the three i mean like some of them like parts it was horrible angel saved me from an armgod there were so many parts everywhere why are terrible thingsalways happening to me  karma so much for our zombie theory  so much for all our theories i dont get it why go to the trouble to dig upthree girls only to throw them away it doesnt make sense especiallyfrom a timemanagement standpoint what i saw didnt add up to three whole girls  i think they kept some parts could this get yuckier  they probably kept them to eat question answered why dispose of the remains five miles fromthe cemetery at a school of all places maybe because whoever did it had somebusiness in the neighbourhood like classes this was no hatchet job whoever madethose incisions knew what they were doin yes really what student hereis that wellversed in physiology i can think of five or six guysin the science club and me so will come clean promise tonever do it again

it worked  what if that poor girl is walking around poor girls technically  what could she be thinking what are they gonna do with her i dont think we haveto worry about that just yet i spoke to a press person this morningabout the remains the police have sorted through themand they found three heads in the dumpster  they only had three girls precisely so they dont have the whole uh package heads must be no goodhuh i found em attractive enough  obviously im not as sick as chris and eric based on what the police put together id say theyre one step shortof completing their masterpiece one step were running out of time if we wait too long the atrophyin the limbs will be irreversible we can turn up the currentthatll buy us a day at least we will lose the bodyif we dont attach a head soon

i dont know why football does it for me i mean it lacks the grace of basketballthe poetry of baseball at its best its unadorned aggressionits such a rugged contest  rugged american football and thats funny because no i just think its rather odd thata nation that prides itself on its virility should feel compelled to strap on 40lbsof protective gear just in order to play rugby is this your normal strategy for a first datedissing my countys national pastime did you just say date  you noticed that huh hi ms calendar hi giles  hey whats up erics was a bust nothing there just computer equipment and a pornographycollection so prodigious it even scared me  did buffy get back yet no uh no perhaps you should uh circulatenearer the field and see what you can find so whats the score  i dont see

here  is everyone ok yeah were ok  sorry about all this its ok although a good rule of thumb for a first date is dont do anything soexciting itll be hard to top on a second date since ive moved to live on the hellmouth the events of this eveningactually qualify as a slow night did you just say second date you noticed that huh i guess that makes it officialeverybodys paired off vampires get dates hell even theschool librarian sees more action than me ever think the worlds like musical chairs andwere the only ones who dont have a chair  all the time xander i just wanted to thank you for saving my life what you did in therewas really brave and heroic  if there is anything i could ever do to do you mind were talkin here  so where were we wondering why we never get dates yeah so why do you think that is god the whole thing was so creepy but at the same timei mean he did do it all for his brother sounds likehe took it a little over the edge  love makes you do the wacky what crazy stuff crazy like a 241yearoldbeing jealous of a highschool junior are you fessing up i thought about itmaybe it bothers me a little  i dont love xander yeah but hes in your life he gets to be there when i cant take your classes eat your mealshear your jokes and complaints he gets to see you in the sunlight i dont look that good in direct light itll be morning soon i should probably go i could walk you home
