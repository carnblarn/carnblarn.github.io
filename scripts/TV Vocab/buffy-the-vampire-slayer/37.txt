longest  i have yeah maybe a little too long excuse me whats that supposed to mean  nothing you got a problem im five by five b livin entirely largeactually wondering about your problem well i may not sleep in the nudeand rassle alligators maybe its time you started cos somethingin your bottle needs uncorking what is it the angel thing what do you know about angel just what ive heard  big love big lossyou oughta deal and move on but youre not i got an idea how about from now onwe dont hear from you on angel or anything else in my lifewhich by the way is my life why are you gettin so strung out

hand this is for me you undead bastard for kakistos we livefor kakistos youll die faith faith you cant touch me  what is wrong with you what do you mean you living large on that vampire gee if doing violence to vampires upsetsyou youre in the wrong line of work  or maybe you like it a little too much i was getting the job done the job is to slay demons not beat them toa bloody pulp while their friends corner me i thought you could handle yourself you must realise buffy that you and faithhave very different temperaments and mines the sane one the girls not playing with a full deckshe has almost no deck she has a three you said yourself that she killed one shes just a plucky fighterwho got a little carried away which is naturalshes focused on the slaying  she doesnt have a life here as you do she doesnt need a life she has mine  i think youre being a little no im being a lot i know that she nearly got us both killedthe girl needs help all right ill see if i can reachher watcher at the retreat theyre eight hours ahead nowtheyre probably sitting down to a nightcap i wonder if they still kayaki used to love a good kayak you see they dont even consider sorry i digressthe vampire that attacked you can you furnish me with some detailsthat might help me trace their lineage ancient or modern dressamulets cultish tattoos no tats crappy dressers and oh the one that nearly bit mementioned something about kissing toast  he lived for kissing toast you mean kakistos maybe it was taquitosmaybe he lived for taquitos what kakistos is that bad kakistos is greekit means the worst of the worst its also the name of a vampireso old that his hands and feet are cloven now this guy shows uptwo days ago right right around the time my bestestnew little sister makes the scene you think he and faith are connected giles there are two things i dont believe incoincidence and leprechauns buffy its entirely possible that they botharrived here by chance simultaneously ok but i was rightabout the leprechauns right as far as i know good ok you phone englandill talk to faith see if khaki trousers rings  kakistos kakistos rings a bell or an alarm  right right hi  scott how are you  ok i gotta be somewhere else right think of this as my lastditch efforti realise one more will qualify as stalking ive given a lot of thought  some might saytoo much  to how i might be part of your life it begins with conversation we all know thismaybe over a cup of coffee or maybe at the buster keaton festivalplaying on state street all this weekend you know come to think of it i dont thinkive given a fair chance to buster keaton i like what ive seen of him so fari think it might be time to see a little more keaton is key oh um i got you a little present a guy inthe retro shop said it represents friendship and thats somethingid very much like to have with you you like i cant i cant do this ok i get the message are you all right giles hi uh yeah im fine  did you reach the retreat yes i did what did her watcher say her watchers dead the rooms 18 a day  thats every day ill get it to you by tomorrow i swear its not like i own the place  but i bet you will some day not if i listen to broads like you  roommates are extra im just visiting so what brings you to the poor side of town cloven guy goes by the name kakistos  what do you know about kakistos that hes here were not happy to see old friends are wewhat did he do to you its what i did to him all right and what was that faith you came herefor a reason i can help you can mind your own businessim the one who can handle this yeah youre a real badasswhen it comes to packing what was that you said about my problemgotta deal and move on well you have the movingon part here whatabout dealing you gonna dump that on me you dont know me or what ive beenthrough ill take care of this all right like you took care of your watcher he killed her didnt he they dont have a word for what he did to her  oh what now faith you run he runs after you thats where the head start comes in handy faith i just bought us a little more time  oh no scream later escape now lets go were ok what happened faith what happened i was there when he killed my watcher and i saw what he did to herwhat he was gonna do to me i tried to stop him but ii couldnt and i ran faith first rule of slaying  dont die you did the right thing ok you didnt dienow you do the math  one of him two of us yes no  this is his place he drove us here faith dont die dont if we dont do somethingthe master could get killed well our prayers are with him theres a reason these vengeancecrusades are out of style see the modern vampirewe see the big picture i guess you need a bigger stake slayer you hungry starved the council has approved our request faith is to stay here indefinitely and im to look after you bothuntil a new watcher is assigned good she really came through in the end she had a lot to deal withbut she did it she got it behind her im glad to hear it angel was cured im sorry when i killed him angel was cured your spell worked at the last minute will i was about to take him out and umsomething went through him and he was angel again he didnt remember anything that hed done he just held me but it was it was too late and i had to so i told him that i loved himthen i kissed him then i killed him i dont know if that helpswith your spell or not giles yes i believe it will im sorry its ok ive been holding onto that for so longit felt good to get it out ill see you guys later giles i know you dont like meplaying with mystical forces but i can really helpwith this binding spell there is no spell scott hello hey i was waiting for you to get out of class oh why there was someone a while agoand the ring sort of confused me but i liked what
