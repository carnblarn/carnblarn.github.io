i dont know i heard something i tried to grab a bat it hit me  what hit you the bat by itself the thing was floating and it knocked me out id better check out the scene where do you think youre going mitch wanted me to get his combhe likes his comb i dont think mitch needs his combmitch needs medical attention and you need to stay away from thecrime scene always sticking your nose in sue what did you say mitch was gonna sue the school sue who his dads a powerful lawyer in sunnydale  hold on what have you two heard his dad the lawyer you dont know him other lawyers call him the beast look thats all it said look at what look at mitch maybe all i know is its a message  and ah here you are and monsters dont usually send messagesits crush kill destroy this was different  id have to say youre right i love it when he says that any theories its a bit of a puzzle really ive never heard of anyoneattacked by a ione baseball bat before maybe its a vampire bat im alone with that one huh well assuming the bat is not possessedthere are a few possibilities to investigate someone with telekinesisthe power to move objects at will an invisible creatureor possibly a poltergeist  a ghost yes and a very angry one yeah id saythe locker room was a real scene  if its a ghost were talking about a dead kid i guess so why not compile a list of dead ormissing kids could be a good place to start and ill research all the possibilities xander if youre not doing anythingwould you like to help me what theres homework now  when did that happen its part of the glamour of vampire slayage  what part do you have im gonna find out what i can about mitch  i want that part fine you can do it ask around talk to his friendstalk to cordelia talk to cordelia so research huh  hi oh hi  cordelia you werent in

here look im not gonna hurt youi just wanna talk to you  giles have you touched a ghost uh no from what ive heard having onepass through you is a singular experience its a its a rather cold amorphous feelingmakes your hair stand on end thats my problem i touched the thingbut it didnt go through me it bumped into me and it wasnt cold  so were talking about an invisible person a girl she laughed a girl on campuswith the ability to become invisible  that is so cool cool yeah id give anything to be able to do that i wouldnt use my powers to beat people upjust to protect the girls locker room it must be a fairly heady experience having that ability howd she get itis she a witch cos we can fight a witch hm greek myths speak of cloaks ofinvisibility but theyre usually for the gods research boycomes through with the knowledge  this girls sort of petty for a god shes got a grudge but why harmony  and mitch the common denominator is cordelia so what now  tomorrow pull up that missing kids list got it ill see you then  bye see ya wanna come over for dinner moms makingher famous call to the chinese place xander do you guys even have a stove so ill look into waysthat you can decloak an invisible someone what about you cordelia might be working on her dresstonight maybe therell be some action i guess im gonna start the hunt how exactly do you proposeto hunt someone you cant see you may have to listen to people  very funny i thought so should i wear my hair upshould i wear it up how does the hem go is it long enough or isnt that beautiful whos there a vampire casts no reflection dont worry im not here to eat  buffy said you no longer feed from humans not for a long while is that why youre here to see her i cant its too hard for me to be around her a vampire in love with a slayer its rather poetic in a maudlin sort of way what can l uh what can i do for you i know youve been researching the master yes the vampire king i try to learn as much as i can about himfor the day buffy must face him somethings already in motionsomething big but i dont know what youve read all the slayer lore right ive studied all the extant volumes of course but the most salient booksof slayer prophecy have been lost the tiberius manifestothe pergamum codex codex its reputed to have contained the mostcomplete prophecies about the slayers role unfortunately the book was lostin the 15th century not lost misplaced i can get it that would be most helpful my own volumeshave been rather useless of late legends of vishnu theres an invisible girlterrorising the school thats not really my area of expertise nor mine im afraid its fascinating though by all accountsits a wonderful power to possess oh i dont know looking in the mirror every dayand seeing nothing there its an overrated pleasure god i am never sitting throughanother one of those alumni lectures again two hours of my trek through nepal hello there is nobody caring and did you see his toupeeit was like a cabbage and those slidesthats a mountain thats a mountain too now look at some mountains i swear he had three slidesand just used them over and over i know but did you see his toupeeit was like the worst were talking ok oh and did you guyscheck out that extreme toupee yeah thats realisticit looked like a cabbage thats so funny the winner is cordelia chase lets bring up our new may queen cordelia thank you for making the right choice andfor showing me how much you all love me being this popular is notjust my rightbut my responsibility and i want you to knowi take it very seriously it all began so giles said youd be herewhy are you being here last night was a bustbut i still think cordies the key this is the dead and missing list i pulledup their classes activities medical records good work has cordelia hired a bodyguardor something check out this one its the most recentmarcie ross disappeared six months ago  i dont know her me neither her only activity was bandshe played the flute so last night when i was huntingi heard this flute and it was in the band roomthat i lost miss invisible this tracks im gonna check it out  see you guys later ok well see you after geometry marcie ross so it is you cordelia could you possibly be on time whos there ms miller oh my god ms miller oh my god are you ok ms miller ah what happened attacked didnt see a nest looked like shed been there for monthsits where i found this  check it out oh my god have a nice summer have a nice summer this girl had no friends at all uh once again i teeterat the precipice of the generation gap  its what you write if youve nothing to say its the kiss of death you didnt know marcie ross never met her why cos you both wrote it too have a nice yeesh where am i oh have a great summer  see i cared you guys dont remember her no i probably didnt see her exceptto sign the book i mean this is a big school xander we each had four classeswith her last year no one noticed her and now shes invisible she turned invisiblebecause no one noticed her of course ive been investigating the mystical causes ofinvisibility but not the quantummechanical physics i think i speak for everyone herewhen i say huh its a rudimentary conceptthat reality is shaped even even created by our perception and with the hellmouthand its mystical energy people perceived marcie as invisibleand she became so so who knows the answer to this onethink about it cordelia just because this storys about himdoesnt mean hes the hero right exactly so what do we call him  willow well the protagonist  xander why cant he be both he did heroic things absolutely who doesnt agree ok and how about you this isnt this great power that she cancontrol but something that was done to her  that we did to her no wonder shes miffed what does she want just what we thought  cordelia what i knew youd be here buffy i know weve had our differenceswith you being so weird and all and hanging out with these total losers ooh anyway despite that i know you sharethis feeling that we have for each other  deep down nausea somebody is after me theyve just tried to kill ms millershe was helping me with my homework and mitch and harmony this is all about me me me me wow for once shes right so youve come to me for help because youre always aroundwhen weird stuff is happening and i know youre very strongand youve got all those weapons i was kind of hoping you were in a gang please i dont have anyone else to turn to please  sit down ok thanks you know i i dont recallever seeing you here before oh no i have a life ok cordelia your attacker is an invisible girl who is really angry at youwhich i cant imagine personally but it takes all kinds you know i dont care what it is just get rid of it well its not that simple its a person its this person  do you have any idea why shed be so god is she really wearing laura ashley so homicidal i have no ideaive never seen this girl before in my life i guess you didnt see me coming cordelia you dont remember mei remember you and your slut friends i hate them they take your life and suck itout of you but they didnt see me coming no they gotta learn from what you told usabout the attack on ms miller we now have two messages from marcie look and listen messages we dont understand i dont think were supposed to yetmarcies not quite ready but from what she did to this pictureshes wigged on the may queen thing she may do something about it stop the coronation tonight maybekeep you guys away from the bronze nothing is keeping mefrom the bronze tonight can we just revelin your fabulous lack of priorities if im not crowned tonight then marcies won and that would be badshes evil ok way eviler than me  cordelia has a point buffys with me on this anyway continuing the may queen activitiesmay be the best way to draw marcie out  we can use cordelia as bait great bait willow and xanderyoull help me begin our research anew unless we cure marcies invisibility  then buffy will be a sitting duck  come on well i have to try on my dress am i really bait so how creepy is it that this marciesbeen at this for months spying on us learning our most guarded secrets so are you saying shes invisiblebecause shes so unpopular  that about sums it up bummer for her  its awful to feel that ionely youve read something about the feeling hey you think im never ionelybecause im so cute and popular i can be surrounded by peopleand be completely alone its not like any of them really know me i dont even knowif they like me half the time people just want to be in the popular zone sometimes when i talk everyones so busy agreeing with methey dont hear a word i say well if you feel so alone thenwhy do you work so hard at being popular it beats being alone all by yourself listen come on we
