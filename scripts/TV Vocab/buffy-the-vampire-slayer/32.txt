                in every generation there is a chosen one  she alone will stand against the vampires the demons and the forces of darkness  she is the slayer   gilded ghetto   hollywood stained below  all im saying is its a stupid idea to have a victory party at the beach  its officially nippy so say my nips  i think its festive a party with nature  well its the teams choice it was their victory  team swim team  hardly what i call a team the yankees  abbott and costello the a now those were teams   jealous  no yes but no more than yes  i mean look at that dodd mcalvy last month hes the freak with jicama breath  who waxes his back he wins a few meets and suddenly inherits the cool gene  well all i know is my cheerleading squad wasted a lot of pep on losers  its about time our school excelled at something  youre forgetting our high mortality rate   were number one huh  yeah   one  one  beautiful  isnt it   yeah its just so  eternal  a true mother giving birth to new life and devouring old  always adaptable and nurturing yet  constant and merciless  boy i was just gonna go with big and wet  me and some of the other guys on the team  we come out here once a week to train in it  see we swim against the current  funny thats how i feel most of the time  so cameron walker you just won the state semifinals  what are you going to do next  im going to hang out with buffy summers get to know her   hey pause that tape for a second  hey no pressure  i just like being around you thats all   somebody help me  yeah  come on jonny you gotta hold your breath longer than that  if you ever wanna make the team  hey somebody time him  hey  nice tat what they ran out of tweety bird   hey whats your problem  had it coming to you bro  chill dude a bunch of us are gonna take a little night dip down on the beach   you in  whatever   hey lets lets get you a towel  no  why didnt you mind your own business i can handle this without your help  see its fun to hang out with me  man i cant believe buffy  man that girl gives me the creeps  oh dude what is that foulness  hey dodd  dude  go fish  ok good pie charts everyone  good   all good  thanks  nice  good  gage your pie chart is  looking a lot like solitaire   with naked ladies on the cards  whats your point  no point  nice work in yesterdays meet son now lets go for it   uh hi there sir  rosenberg   hows the class everything in order  well actually  great ive been talking to the board  weve been having trouble finding a competent teacher this late in the term  do you think you can continue subbing through finals  oh sure i like teaching  isnt that nice youre a team player and i like that  a team player wants everyone on the team to succeed wants everyone to pass  well yeah sure  i understand theres a problem with gage petronzi  oh good then you know well yeah  besides the behavior problem he wont do homework and his test scores are  well actually he doesnt have any test scores  because he never shows up when we  im not interested in any of that  im interested in why when this school is on the brink  of winning its first state championship in fifteen years  you slap a crucial member of that team with a failing mark  that would force his removal   is that how you show your school spirit  yes well i mean no   im just trying to grade fairly  gage is a champion  hes under more pressure than the other students  and i think we need to cut him some slack  youre asking me to change his grade  i never said any such thing  all im suggesting is that you recheck your figures  and i think well find a grade more fitting to an athlete of gages stature  perhaps something in a d  just like that he actually told you to alter his grade  exactly except for actually telling me to  but he made it perfectly clear of what he wasnt telling me  that is wrong a big fat spankin wrong  its a slap in the face to everyone of us who studied hard  and worked long hours to earn our ds  xander i know you take pride in being the voice of the common wuss  but the truth is certain people are entitled to special privileges  theyre called winners thats the way the world works  and what about that nutty all men are created equal thing  propaganda spouted out by the ugly and less deserving  i think that was lincoln   disgusting mole and stupid hat  actually it was jefferson   kept slaves remember  you know what really grates my cheese  that buffys not here to share my moral outrage about swimteam perks  shes too busy being one of them  i dont know a dolphin a dolphin in the ocean  because you know when im in the vastness of the ocean  its its like im never alone  you ever hear of a woman named gertrude ederle  no no i cant say that i have cam  first woman to swim the english channel same thing  i mean she would talk to it i mean shed carry on entire conversations with it  sometimes i do that i mean once i was  you know what cam thanks  id forgotten how nice it is to just talk  or in my case listen without any romantic pressure  hey im not about pressure i just want you to be comfortable  im comfy im so comfy im nodding off actually which is why  are you wearing a bra  what  come on i mean tell me you havent been thinking about this ever since last night  what im thinking about is that i should probably get out of this car  relax im not gonna hurt you  oh its not me im worried about  you like it rough  ow oh  oh you broke my nose ah  i wasnt the attacker principal snyder i was the attacked  thats not how it looked from where i was standing  i dont know what happened i mean first she leads me on  then she goes schizo on me  lead you on when did i lead you on  oh come on i mean look at the way she dresses   coach  how we doing cameron  coach marin how bad does it look  well luckily its not broken but sure as hell its gonna sting for a few days  i mean our chances of winning the state championship   oh  can we still do it  im gonna need cameron back at 110 hes my best swimmer now with dodd   what happened to dodd  thats none of your concern  youd better hope that boys nose heals before the meet this friday  walker i want you to hit the steam room uh  as soon as youre done here and try to keep those sinuses clear   take care of my boy ruthie  i always do  and you try to dress more appropriately from now on  this isnt a dance club  so im treated like the baddie  just because he has a sprained wrist and a bloody nose  and i dont have a scratch on me which granted  hurts my case a little on the surface but meanwhile  he gets away with it because hes on the arent we the most swim team  who by the way if no ones noticed have been acting like real jerks lately  so anything new with you guys  thank you for taking an interest  apparently some remains were found on the beach this morning  some human remains   dodd mcalvys remains  vampire  no no he was eviscerated nothing left but skin and cartilage  in other words this was no boating accident  so something ripped him open and ate out his insides  like an oreo cookie  well except for you know without the chocolaty cookie goodness  yeah um principal snyder has asked the faculty  to keep the news quiet for now um   so as not to unduly upset students  for students read swim team   so were looking for a beastie  that uh eats humans whole   except for the skin  this doesnt make any sense   yeah the skins the best part  any demons with high cholesterol  youre gonna think about that later mister and youre gonna laugh  ok son i think youve had enough  time to hit the shower  too much research need beverage  hey watch it  oh forgive me your swim teamliness   loser  liking the nose cam   good look for you  meaning what  meaning buffy must not be on your list of privileges after all  man i love it when you guys mess with her  youre lucky im hungry  oh the cafeterias closed  not to me  god what is that  grape orange  orange grape  oh my god  oh god  no no no the mouths a lot bigger  and downward like this  with more teeth  im doing the best i can  is that what you saw xander  yeah i think so   pretty much  are you sure  well it was dark and the thing went through the window so quick  and i was uh a little shocked when i saw it and  go ahead say it you ran like a woman  hey if you saw this thing youd run like a woman too  buffy was right according to the statistics  dodd and cameron were the best swimmers on the team  first and second actually which means if my theorys correct  gage petronzi the third best swimmer on the team  would be the next item on the menu  god this is so sad were never gonna win the state championship  i think i have lost all will to cheerlead  raise your hand if you feel her pain  if youre saying these killings arent random  it would suggest someones out for revenge  and raise the possibility that someone brought forth this sea monster  from whence it came to exact that revenge  from whence it came  im spending way too much time around you  who would hate the swim team that much though  besides me i mean   willow  jonathan  he was bullied by dodd the other day on the beach remember  he did say he could take care of things himself  its a good call you should question him  really me ill crack him like an egg  meanwhile i think swimmer number three might benefit from your  watchful eye and protection  discreetly of course   im on it  what about me what can i do  well you could go out to the parking lot and practice running like a man  so jonathan  you tried out for the swim team twice and never made it  im asthmatic i couldnt keep up   you resented it didnt you  maybe  you hated being pushed around by dodd and the others   so  so you wanted revenge didnt you  didnt you  yeah ok i did  so you delved into the black arts  and conjured up a hell beast from the oceans depths to wreak your vengeance   didnt you  what no  i snuck in yesterday and  peed in the pool  oh  eww  this is such a blow  sooner or later the rest of my boys are gonna find out  how can i ask them to swim  its a terrible terrible tragedy we all feel your pain coach  i dont know two finer boys than cameron and that other one  but i know theyd want their friends to go on and win that state championship  its time to think about the team  hell i dont have a complete team as it is  if we dont find someone by this afternoons tryouts  we wont be eligible to compete  youll find someone all he has to do  is wear a bathing suit right   if youd listen by neros rome   if youd listen   we wouldnt have to go through this   if youd just let me finish   stop cuttin and jumpin ahead   yeah if youd just shut your pretty mouth   youd save yourself some tears   if you came back from the bathroom   with somethin on your shoe  this me and my shadow act  its getting old what do you want from me  well um  its a little embarrassing you see   im a swim groupie  uhhuh  oh yeah  you know theres just something about the  smell of chlorine on a guy oh baby  ok ok ok  obviously my sex appeal is on the fritz today  so ill just give it to you straight  theres something lurking out there and its making fillets of the populace  and i think you might be next  uhhuh and you think that because  well its already attacked its already killed some people  youre one twisted sister you know that  cam told me about your games  go find someone else to harass  what a psycho bitch man  gotta be talking about buffy   howd you know  uh she and i  had this thing once biggest mistake of my life   yeah my condolences dude  shes a real headtripper  tell me about it girl acts like shes gods gift or something   who is she the chosen one  exactly  you know what she really needs is for someone  to really knock her down off her notches   yeah thatd be sweet anyone in mind  youre in luck my friend   just so happens im recruiting  no  ah somebody help  ah help ah ah  get him off me help  ah  why miss summers youre beautiful  was that the thing that killed cameron  no that was something else  ssomething else  yeah unfortunately we have a lot of something elses in this town  good night  hey  walk me home  swimmers take position  keep the stroking up alright keep it going  keep it going all the way to the end  all the way to the end breathe deep  gage you with us or not come on lets go  so he spit it out   i thought angel liked blood  he used to  maybe his eyes were too big for his stomach  or maybe there was something in gages blood angel didnt like  say for example steroids  that would explain all their behavioral changes  and their winning streak  so maybe whatevers in their blood  is whats attracting this creature to them  any luck researching our fish monster  zippo we couldnt find any sea demon  that matched the description that xander gave us  not that chicken littles much of a witness but  oh  oh oh my  now that girls is my kind of  xander  xander  what the hell are you doing here   im undercover  youre not under much  get out of here before someone sees you impersonating a member of the swim team  i dont do impersonations i tried out for the team last night   i made it  really  yeah i figured i can keep an eye on gage and the others when buffy cant  when youre nude i meant to say changing  harris you can flirt on your own time  okeydokey coachie  im dating a swimmer from the sunnydale swim team  you can die happy  what about jonathan is he involved  oh no he just sort of peed in the pool  oh  oh  dont you guys get claustrophobic in here  i mean whats the deal  you perspire a lot you cant breathe  or read i mean i guess you could  but the pages would probably get all wet  you gotta love this undercover deal  with a bunch of sweaty guys   wheres gage  i dont know he was right behind me  putting his sneakers on but its not the velcro kind  so give him a couple of extra minutes  tag youre it  oh my god  help help me help me  ah help me  gage  i dont think that this is going to need stitches  but you might wanna have your family physician take a look at it   how are you  im definitely feeling the burn  well the uh good news is that  it would appear that none of your team actually died  but the bad news is theyre monsters   how could this happen  are you saying you dont know  well you work so hard you start to win suddenly  you think its just you  youre inspiring the boys to greatness  but in the back of your mind you start to wonder  you never asked any of the boys if they were taking anything  maybe i was afraid to   there  dodd mcalvy torn tendon  gage petronzi fractured wrist depression headaches  its all there in the school medical records  all symptomatic of steroid abuse  but is steroid abuse usually linked with hey im a fish  there must be something else in the mix  but the point is these boys were obviously drugged  nurse greenliegh treated every one of them  she must have known  if steroids are that dangerous why would they do that to themselves  they needed to win  winning equals trophies which equals prestige for the school  you see how theyre treated its been like that forever  sure the discus throwers got the best seats at all the crucifixions  meanwhile im breaking my nails every day battling the forces of evil  and my french teacher cant even remember my name  so whats the drill get nurse greenliegh  lets throw the book at her  she probably went home for the day i think it can wait  xander why dont you see if you can find out what these boys are taking  or at least how theyre taking it   powders pills syringe  im looking around guy   what about you  giles loaded up the tranquillizer gun  were going fishing  i feel good  lovin the swimmin  had some carrot juice this morning a little wheat germ mixed in with it  woke me right up nothing like it huh  breakfast of state champions you betcha  ok so when do we get our next dose   what do you mean  whos carrying  i need a little something to improve my performance  give me an edge rrr  the steroids where are they   youre soakin in it bud  huh  aromatherapy its in the steam  this has got to stop carl those poor children  what are you a quitter we have no room for quitters on this team  do you even understand whats happening   listen to yourself  im very close to perfecting this  we just need to adjust the mix  carl you cant be thinking of continuing to expose these boys  theyre gonna be the best i dont accept anything less  theyre gonna be monsters  carl please dont make it any worse youve already lost three  lost why theyre not lost   carl what are you doing  im just looking after my boys  they may be out of the game right now but theyre still a team  and a teams gotta eat   carl  you quitter  theyre absorbing the steroid mixture through the steam  not they we  me  we need to find an antidote dont you think  the clock is ticking people  i wouldnt break out the tartar sauce just yet  its not like you were exposed more than once   twice  three times a fish guy   oh  whoa   what am i gonna do  you you you  what about me its one thing to be dating the lame unpopular guy  but its another to be dating the creature from the blue lagoon  black lagoon the creature from the blue lagoon was brooke shields  and thank you so much for your support  i think wed better find the rest of the swim team and lock them up  before they get in touch with their inner halibut  yes yes good uh  we also need to know exactly whats in this this steroid gas  so that the hospitals toxicology lab can develop an antidote  well ill talk to nurse greenliegh  youre really getting into this interrogation thing  the trick is not to leave any marks  on that note i think im gonna go have a little talk with our coach  somehow i doubt all hes been giving these boys is inspiration  you got some imagination missy  oh well right now im imagining you in jail  youre wearing a big orange suit and oh look the guards are beating you up   you dont have any proof  tell me whats in the steam  after the fall of the soviet union  documents came into light  detailing experiments with fish dna on their olympic swimmers  tarpon mako shark   but they couldnt crack it  and you did  sort of  why  what kind of question is that  for the win  to make my team the best they could be  do you understand we have a shot at the state championship  do you understand that i dont care its over  theres not gonna be any swim team  boy when they were handing out school spirit  you didnt even stand in line did you  no i was in the line for shred of sanity  which you obviously skipped  get in the hole  in now   this isnt over  in  you think i dont care about my boys  but i do they count on me  so what youre just gonna feed me to em  oh theyve already had their dinner  but boys have other needs  no one willow and giles mustve rounded up the swim team   does my neck look scaly to you  well of course it looks scaly  the way youve been rubbing it dry like an idiot  i need to look in a mirror wait here  but feel free to come in if you hear me scream  any gills yet  xander what are you doing xander  oh my god xander  its me  cordelia  i know you cant answer me but  god this is all my fault  you joined the swim team to impress me  you were so courageous  and you looked really hot in those speedos  and i want you to know that  i still care about you no matter what you look like  and and we can still date  or or not i mean  i understand if you wanna see other fish  ill do everything i can to make your quality of life better  whether that means little bath toys or whatever  uh cordy thats not me  oh my god  in you go  stay calm chaps  either well find an effective antidote or or uh  just stay calm  everyones accounted for except sean  i think we can safely say we found sean  he was in the pool skinlessdipping   wheres buffy  she hasnt come back yet  great this is just what my reputation needs  that i did it with the entire swim team   whats up coach  oh harris uh   how you feeling  a little dry  nothing a lemon butter sauce wont cure  wheres buffy  buffy hurry your hand  hold on   pull  hold on   thanks  just doing my part for our team  dont let go dont let go of me hold me  hold me ah  grab my hand  boys boys uh now now boys  no i no boys  those boys really love their coach  lets see i gotta take a makeup chem test at three  and then im meeting some of the guys for plasma transfusions at five  its turned into quite the busy afternoon  the fun never stops with you does it  giles seems pretty confident that the treatments are gonna work  well turning into a creepycrawly wasnt on  my top ten list of things to do before i turn 20  i want you to know that youve really proven yourself to me  and you dont have to join the new team next year if you dont want  id be just as happy if you played football  the people from animal control have just left  our creatures have apparently made a a dash for it um  so to speak  does that mean were gonna have to hunt them again  no i dont think so i dont think well be seeing them any more   where do you think theyll go  home
