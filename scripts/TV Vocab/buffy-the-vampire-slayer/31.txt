your fault  mr snyder billy crandal chained himself to the snack machine again  pathetic little nolife vegan  not so fast missy im not done with you yet  you stink of lies  so for next time read the chapters on information grouping and binary coding  i bet youll think coding is pretty cool i mean  if you find twodigit multistacked conversions  and primarynumber clusters a big hoot  giles i made them laugh did you hear   i did the joke thing  yes yes so it seems  ii mean um uh you did indeed good good good show  iii just stopped by to to see if you needed any assistance  but you seem to have things quite under control  well i had good lesson plans  ms calendar had them on her computer  yes yes she was very um  uh dedicated  and i found a bunch of files and internet sites  on paganism and magic and stuff   oh  yes its really interesting  and uh  i found this in her drawer  she told me it was a rose quartz and it has healing powers  i thought shed want you to have it  oh thank you willow thats um  thats very thoughtful of you  before 1935 the new deal focused on revitalizing stricken business  and agricultural communities  the new deal also tried to regulate the nations financial hierarchy  to avoid another disaster like the 1929 stock market crash  dont forget your assignments are due on friday class  i told miss hall wed go help decorate the gym who are you taking   david said yes  oh youre kidding hes so dreamy  thank you  thank you james how are you enjoying that book i loaned you   the hemingway  i like it  very much  its honest  yes its um  its based on a true story actually  he fell in love with his  hours  child labor  and collective bargaining dont walk away from me bitch   oh my god  did you see what he wrote  im telling you something weird is going on  something weird is going on  isnt that our school motto  pretty much but i dont know this time it bugs me  i dont wanna poohpooh your wiggins but a domestic dispute  a little case of chalkboard tourettes  all sounds like hellmouth lite to me  xander what happened  did cordelia win another round in the broom closet  youre just a big bucket of funny will  ill have you know i was just accosted by some kind of um  locker monster   loch ness monster  locker monster is what he said  but it wasnt really a monster it was this big arm that came out of the locker  but then we opened it again it was gone nothing  this was right after buffys history teacher starts doing some  freaky channeling thing in class  ooh sounds like paranormal phenomena   a ghost cool  oh no no no no cool  this was no wimpy chain rattler  this was im dead as hell and im not gonna take it any more  well despite the xanderspeak thats a  fairly accurate definition of a poltergeist  i defined something accurately   guess im done with the book learning  so we have some bad boo on our hands   yes  well why is it here  does it just wanna scare people  unfortunately it doesnt know exactly what it wants thats thats the trouble  see many times the spirit is plagued by all manner of worldly troubles  only being dead it has no way to to make its peace  so it lashes out growing ever more confused ever more   angry  so its a normal teenager only dead  what can we do is there any way to stop it  the only tried and true way is to  work out what unresolved issues keep it here  andandand um resolve them  fabulous now were dr laura for the deceased  only if we can find out who the spirit is  or was   working late ms frank  my fault let myself get behind  is it ok to walk here george it is george right   yes maam go ahead  thanks have a nice evening   you too drive safe oh ms frank  yes  you cant make me disappear just because you say its over  theres no way we can be together  no way people will ever understand accept it  is that what this is about what other people think  no i just want you to be able to have some kind of a normal life   we can never have that dont you see  i dont give a damn about a normal life  im going crazy not seeing you   i think about you every minute  i know but  but its over  it has to be  come back here were not finished yet   you dont care any more is that it  it doesnt matter   it doesnt matter what i feel  then tell me you dont love me  say it  will that help  is that what you have to hear  i dont i dont   now let me go  no  a person doesnt just wake up one day and stop loving somebody  love is forever  im not afraid to use it if i cant be with you  dont walk away from me bitch  i need you  jenny  dont dont do that dammit dont talk to me like im some dumb   whats going on  whats going on  you just shot a woman  and this  this is the garden  wow  look jasmine   nightblooming  like us  oh angel its fairyland  its paradise  big windows lovely gardens  itll be perfect when we want the sunlight to kill us  if you dont like it spike hit the stairs and go  take a stand man  well our old place was just fine till you went and had it burned down  things change spikey you gotta roll with the punches  well actually you pretty much got that part down havent you  very funny mate  what can i say  i just love to see you smile buddy  yeah youre a giver  it was just as with the the couple you encountered the other night buffy  the the janitor remembered everything  he he knew hed killed this poor woman but he had no idea why  well theythey had no intimate relationship   what about the gun did you find it  no no  no the police everybody wewewewe searched high and low  i think its very clear whats happening here  fill me in then cause ive read the book  seen the movie and im still fuzzy about whats going on  its jenny   what  you think shes the ghost  well dont you see well shesheshe died here  under tragic circumstances aaand now shes trapped  but what about the gun i mean angel didnt shoot ms calendar  the gun is insignificant its the violence of the thing that matters  i dont know these fights these couples keep having its sort of specific  shes right its a pattern that doesnt fit with the way ms calendar died  yes well i uh i appreciate your thoughts on the matter  i in fact i well i encourage you to to always uh  challenge me uh when you feel its appropriate  you should never be cowed by authority  except of course in this instance when i am clearly right  and you are clearly wrong  this is freaky i dont remember ever seeing giles be this weird  i know hes usually investigatethings fromeveryboringangle guy  now hes iclingontomyone lameidea guy what gives  he misses her he cant think  just a little more fallout from my love life  ok but this ghost stuff is something else  let me do a crosscheck on other shootings at the school  yeah we need some alternate ghost theories what do we know  dogs spit is cleaner than human   besides that  oh boy we know plenty  it says a student murdered a teacher on the night of the sadie hawkins dance  the rumor was they were having an affair and she tried to break it off  after he killed her he went into the music room and shot himself  ladies and gentlemen we have a ghost it is one of those two right  it all fits the gun the sadie hawkins dance   which is tonight  how come weve never heard about  this murdersuicide thing before when did it happen   how did you know  ok heres the new strangeness  i dreamt about this woman grace newman the other day   her and this guy  james stanley  hes the one he did it  your dreams are getting wicked accurate buff  you wouldnt happen to see me coming across some big cash  or possibly knowing the love of a woman in a full body sense  he couldnt make her love him so he killed her sicko  he looks so normal on this picture he was smart too he made the honor roll   smart  he killed a person and killed himself  those are pretty much two of the dumbest things you could do  i know but well dont you feel kind of bad for them  sure i feel lousy for her hes a murderer and should pay for it   with his life  no he should be doing   and making special friends with roscoe the weightlifter  yikes the quality of mercy is not buffy  whose ghost do you think were dealing with his or hers  well considering how violent it is im gonna say his  that tracks  well ive been browsing on some of ms calendars pagan sites  maybe i can find a way to communicate with him and  we can find out what he wants  who cares what he wants  we need to shut him down before some other innocent guy  goes and kills some poor nice girl  and then blows his brains out all over the music room wall  ok  whos hungry  next please move along  i hope you guys arent going to the sadie hawkins dance tonight  cause im organizing a boycott  do you realize that the girls have to ask the guys and pay and everything  i mean whose genius idea was that  obviously some hairylegged feminist  really well we need to nip this thing in the bud  i mean otherwise things are going to get really scary  theyre everywhere  perfect im gonna be scarred and swollen why didnt they just kill me   schoolboy pranks  never sell  the sewer got backed up  better i can probably make that one fly but this is getting out of hand   people will talk  youll take care of it  im doing everything i can but you people have to realize   snyder whats going on here  backedup sewer line  same thing happened in san diego just last week  were on a hellmouth  sooner or later people are gonna figure that out  the city council was told you could handle this job  if you feel that you cant perhaps youd like to take that up  with the mayor  ill handle it  i will  remember the plan to contact the spirit and talk to it scrap that plan  buffy you were right the time for touchyfeely communication has passed  ive done some homework and found out the only solution is the final solution  nuke the school   i like that  not quite exorcism  are you crazy i saw that movie even the priest died   whats the deal  ok see here the balcony  thats where the original teacher died back in 1955 and that teacher last night  thats the hot spot where all the bad mojo is coming from   we need to create a mangus tripod  a what  one person chants here on the hot spot  and the other three chant in other places around the school forming a triangle  its supposed to bind the bad spirit and keep it from doing any more harm  well ill take the hot spot if theres trouble thats where itll be  this ghost this james guy is fixating on you buffy the dreams the yearbook  you sure you can handle it  well im hoping hell show i truly am  ok we have our places we do the chant and light candles at midnight exactly   any questions  yeah what if this  mangled triangle thingy doesnt work  oh i almost forgot i made us all scapulars  ok so we can flip the ghost over when it turns a nice golden brown  scapular not spatula  um you wear it around your neck for protection  you expect me to wear this it smells like grandpa breath  sorry i didnt have a lot of time i had to use sulphur   stinky but effective  ok lets do this  no problem this will be a piece of cake right  maybe ill sleep underground  dig myself a little burrow  what about your pretty dress sweet itll get all dirty  then ill sleep naked like the animals do  you know im suddenly likin this plan  fortunately nobody cares what you like mate  oh yeah lets ask dru  theres a gate   its opening  incoming i love when she does this   what gate pet what do you see  its black  it wants her   wants who  the slayer  its time angel  shes ready for you now shes dancing   dancing with death  big deal he wont do anything  our man angel here likes to talk but hes not much for action  all hat and no cattle  i dont know about that  i think this whole slayer thing has run its course  im ready to focus my energy elsewhere   really  oh yeah  what with you being special needs boy  i figure i should stick close to home  you and dru can always use another pair of hands  god willow what are you doing here   youre not supposed to be inside  me what about you  im uh im im trying to uh  i think ii may be close to uh contacting jenny   whats that smell  its my scapular   ah right did you use sulphur  yeah  thats clever uh well uh run along then  ththere may be some uh paranormal phphenomena if i contact her  yyyou dont want to be in the line of fire  ok night  i only have eyes for you by the flamingos   my love must be a kind of blind love   i cant see anyone but you  oh yeah baby its snakealicious in here   the moon may   be high   but i cant see a thing   in the sky   i only   giles  willow  giles giles   where are you  please  help help me help help help help   stop  just calm down  get out   are you all right  giles  jenny could never be this mean  i know  its its not her is it  im sorry  oh god oh  careful up here  i shall confront and expel all evil  i shall totally confront and expel all evil  out of marrow and bone  out of house and home  never to come here again  oh my god  you all right  get back  check it id say schools out for good  the good news is none of you girls were shot  weve weve established based on all the parallels  andandand buffys visions that   its james spirit  so what do we do giles about james  well hes obviously reliving the night of the sadie hawkins dance  when he killed ms newman its its common enough for a spirit  to do this  to recreate a a tragedy  hey if sunnydale high school shuts down forever  do we automatically graduate  but why what does he want   actually thats an interesting point  hes hes trying to  resolve whatever issues are keeping him in limbo   wwwhat exactly those are im not  he wants forgiveness  yes yes i imagine he does  but when james possesses people  they act out exactly what happened that night  so hes experiencing a form of purgatory instead  i mean hes doomed to to kill his miss newman  over and over and over again and   forgiveness is impossible  good he doesnt deserve it  to forgive is an act of compassion buffy  its its not done because people deserve it   its done because they need it  no  james destroyed the one person he loved the most  in a moment of blind passion  and thats not something you forgive  no matter why he did what he did  and no matter if he knows now that it was wrong and selfish and stupid  it is just something hes gonna have to live with  he cant live with it buff  hes dead  ok overidentify much  i need you  so what do we do next do we go in again  uh not now no the uh  the spirit is too angry too too powerful  no we have to work out  exactly how and and if this thing can be defeated  hey buffy are you  oh god giles  she went back  so what now not even a megavat of raids gonna do the trick here  i dont get it is she trying to be a big loner hero or something  no i believe shes under the spirits thrall  hes hes calling her  but why  james needs her to reenact everything that happened  on the night that he he killed ms newman  he wants to change things make make a happy ending  but it cant ever happen it always ends the same  which means buffy just went in there to get shot giles  yes  but the schools deserted  theres no way for james to  to play his part theres theres no man inside for him to possess  so buffy should be safe until we find a way to get her out  in theory yeah  fun fact about wasps  they have no taste for the undead  hey not that a sting would do me any damage its just tonights special  i wanted to look my best for you  youre the only one  the only person i can talk to  gosh buff thats really pathetic  you cant make me disappear just because you say its over  actually i can  in fact  i just want you to be able to have some kind of normal life  we can never have that dont you see  i dont give a damn about a normal life im going crazy not seeing you  i think about you every minute  i know  but its over it has to be  come back here were not finished  you dont care any more is that it  it doesnt matter it doesnt matter what i feel  then tell me you dont love me  say it  is that what you need to hear will that help  i dont   i dont now let me go  no  a person doesnt just wake up and stop loving somebody  love is forever  im not afraid to use it i swear  if i cant be with you  oh my god   dont walk away from me  bitch  stop it  stop it dont make me  all right just  you know you dont wanna do this  lets both  just calm down  now give me the gun  dont dont do that dammit  dont talk to me like im some stupid  james   my love must be a kind of blind love   i cant see anyone but you   grace  dont do this  but but i killed you  it was an accident it wasnt your fault   it is my fault how could i  hush  im the one who should be sorry james  you thought i stopped loving you  but i never did  i loved you with my last breath  shh no more tears  angel  everything seems normal not a snake not a wasp  yep school can open again tomorrow  explain to me again how thats a good thing  im drawing a blank   are you feeling any better  james picked me  i guess  i guess i was the one he could relate to  he was so sad  well  they can both rest now  i still  part of me just doesnt understand why she would forgive him  does it matter  no  i guess not  you might want to let up  they say when youve drawn blood youve exfoliated  what do you know about it  im the one who was freakin violated you didnt have this thing in you  what was it a demon  love  poor angel  lets get out of here i need a real vile kill before sunup  to wipe this crap out of my system  of course well find you a nice toddler  want to come pet  no can do dru im sure hed be hell on wheels  but we dont have much time gotta travel light  sorry try to have fun without me  oh i will  sooner than you think
