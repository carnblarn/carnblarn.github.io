here  ill get it  done  i know dru gives you pity access  but you have to admit its so much easier when i do things for her  you would do well to worry less about dru  and more about that slayer youve been tramping around with  dear buffy hm  im still trying to decide the best way to send my regards  why dont you rip her lungs out that might make an impression  lacks poetry  it doesnt have to  what rhymes with lungs  dont worry spike  angel always knows  what speaks to a girls heart  pain by dingoes ate my baby four star mary   feelin ive been lost for years   you can never understand me

kissy there  and you can chalk it all up to hormones  and maybe thats all we have here  tawdry teen lust  but maybe not  maybe something in you sees something special inside me and vice versa  i mean i think i do see something  so  xander  thank you  its beautiful  i wanna break up  ok not quite the reaction i was lookin for  i know im sorry its just  who are we kidding even if parts of us do see specialness  we dont fit  yeah  ok  do you know whats a good day to break up with somebody  any day besides valentines day  i mean what were you runnin low on dramatic irony  i know i didnt mean to do it this way i  well you did  dude way to get dumped   buffy my bud you would not believe  cant talk right now angel   do you need help  its all right  gee xander maybe you should learn a second language  so that even more girls can reject you  what are you doing  amy good to see ya  youre a witch  no im not that that was my mom remember  yeah im thinkin that runs in the family  i saw you working that mojo on miss beakman   maybe i should go tell somebody  thats not even that is so mean   blackmail is such an ugly word  i didnt say blackmail  yeah but im about to blackmail you so i

a little spell   a love spell  yeah  you know just the basic cant eat cant sleep  cant breathe anything but little old moi  well that kind of thing is the hardest i mean  to make someone love you for all eternity  whoa whoa back up who said anything about eternity  a man can only talk selftanning lotion for so long before his head explodes  well then i dont get it  if you dont wanna be with her for ever whats the point  the point is i want her to want me  desperately so i can break up with her  and subject her to the same hell shes been puttin me through  oh i dont know xander   intent has

you and cordy   thats her loss  yeah  not really the popular theory  you know what id like  why dont you and i do something together tonight just the two of us   really  yeah we can comfort each other  well would lap dancing enter into that scenario at all  cause i find that very comforting  play your cards right  ok uh you do know that im xander right  i dont know i just  heard that you and cordy broke up and  i guess i was just surprised how glad i was  its funny how you can see someone every day  but not really see them you know  yeah its funny  and its just gettin funnier  xander can i talk to you for a minute  yeah ok  oh this is interesting   xander  yeah   i dont think the spell worked out right  oh yeah it bombed no biggie  well we can always try again i am still pretty new at this  oh no no its ok you know what it was wrong  to meddle with the forces of darkness i see that now   i think weve all grown i gotta go  oh we dont have to cast any spells  we can just hang out  sure   what  well i liked spending time with you  youre so sweet  you know its funny how you can you can see a person every day and  not really see them  exactly  so anyway i thought it may be   hi xander  what  youre in mr bairds history class right   yeah  i thought maybe   we could study together tonight  do you mind we were talking  i really gotta go  right now  sorry i wanted to surprise you  good job high marks  dont be so jumpy ive been in your bed before  yeah but will we were both in footie pajamas  xand ive been thinking  will i i think i know what youve been thinking  but this is all my fault   i cast a spell and it sort of backfired  how long have we been friends  a long long time  too long to do anything that might change that now  but friendships change all the time  people grow apart they grow closer  this is good  how close we are now  i feel comfortable with this amount of closeness  in fact i can even back up a few paces and still be happy  see  i want you xander   to be my first  baseman  please tell me were talking baseball  we both know its right  its not that i dont find you sexy  is it oz dont worry about him  hes sweet but hes not you  yes he is and you should go to him cause hes me  iii dont wanna use force  force is ok  thats it this has gotta stop  its time for me to act like a man  and hide  ha very funny what did i do now wear red and purple together  you know what you did xander is wounded because of you  are you tripping i thought you wanted me to break up with him  only a sick pup would let xander get away no matter what her friends said  what does it take to make you people happy  got the love by the average white band   yeah   got the love got the love   mm yeah   got the love got the love   got the love got the love   sugar baby   got the love got the love   oh now babe you been gone such a long time   been thinkin bout what it is we got   not all the time in the world   but we got a lot   now theres much more than a ghost of a chance   we can make it   right this time   cause youve got to stay mine   yeah i got the love   got the love got the love   we got to make it work   got the love got the love  xander   what is it  its its me   throwing myself at your mercy  what why  i made a mess giles  see i found out that amys into witchcraft and i was hurt i guess  so i made her put the love whammy on cordy but it backfired  and now every woman in sunnydale wants to make me her cuddle monkey  which may sound swell on paper but  rupert we need to talk hey xander  nice shirt  look rupert i know youre angry at me  and i dont blame you but i am not just gonna go away  i mean i care far too much about you to  have you been working out  i cannot believe you were fool enough to do this  oh no im twice the fool it takes to do something like this  has erm has amy tried to reverse the spell  i get around amy and all she wants to do is talk honeymoon plans  rupert maybe i need to talk to xander alone  do you have any idea how serious this is  people under a love spell xander are deadly  they lose all capacity for reason  and if what you say is true and the entire female population is affected  dont leave the library  ill find amy and see if we can put a stop to this thing  no  alone at last   buff give me a heart attack  oh  im gonna give you more than that  buff for the love of god dont open that raincoat  come on its a party  arent you gonna open your present  its not that i dont want to  sometimes the remote impossible possibility that you might like me  was all that sustained me but not now  not like this  this isnt real to you youre only here because of a spell  i mean if i thought you had one clue what it would mean to me  but you dont  so i cant  so youre saying this is all a game  a game i no  you make me feel this way and then you reject me   what am i a toy  buffy please calm down  ill calm down when you explain yourself  get away from him  hes mine  oh i dont think so   xander tell her  what i uh  he doesnt have to say i know what his heart wants  funny i know what your face wants  what is this youre twotiming me  goddess hecate work thy will  before thee let the unclean thing crawl  buffy  oh my god   whwhat just happened  buffy  where where is she   oh my god  why is she here  can you focus for a minute you just turned buffy into a rat  buffy can take care of herself   why dont we go someplace private  can you  im not going anywhere until you change her back  you heard him so why dont you undo your magic trick and get lost  who made you queen of the world  well youre old enough to be  well what can i say  i guess xanders just too much man for the pimple squad  goddess hecate to you i pray   with this  quit with the hecate  ok what now you dont like my locker combination  its just not right you never loved him you just used him   you make me sick  ok harmony  if you need to borrow my midol just ask  you two sit  be quiet  we have to catch the buffyrat  ooh there  good buffy  just   that kinda hurt  kinda what was that for  i was on the phone all night listening to willow cry about you  now i dont know exactly what happened  but i was left with the strong urge to hit you   i didnt touch her i swear  xander  wheres buffy  amy turned her into a rat  i dont see her if anything happens to her ill  oh just go home lock yourself away  youre only going to cause more problems here  um amy jenny and i will try and break the spell  oz if you could aid us in finding erm buffy  sure absolutely   if  just go get out of my sight  buffy  what are you doing you guys are crazy  you thought you could do better is that it  well knock that snotty attitude right out of you  you must have botched the ritual so that  cordelias necklace actually protected her from the spell  it should be easily reversible where did you learn animal transformation  why did you send xander away he needs me   thats a laugh  he loves me  we look into each others souls  no one can love two people at once  what we have is real  instead of making me ill why doesnt one of you try to help me   you have no idea what im going through  i know its not love  its obsession  selfish banal obsession  xander has put himself in very grave danger  if you cared at all about him youd help save him  rather than wittering on about your feelings  now lets get on with some work now jenny  great  i think we   lost em  i should have known  id find you with her  will come on you dont wanna hurt me  oh no  you dont know how hard this is for me i love you so much  id

here  i dont know what youre up to dru but it doesnt amuse  if you harm one hair on this boys head  youve gotta be kidding him  just because ive finally found a real man   i guess i really did drive you crazy  your face is a poem  i can read it  really it doesnt say spare me by any chance  how do you feel about eternal life  we couldnt just start with a coffee  a movie maybe   there he is hes

mean the spell was for me  xander let me touch you  goddess of creatures great and small i conjure thee to withdraw  hecate  i hereby license thee to depart  buffy   oh my god  stay behind me  xander  i need you come here please  erm diana  goddess of love be gone  hear no more thy sirens song  get off  get off me  whats going on where am i  whats going on   hi oz  hi  i seem to be having a slight case of nudity here  but youre not a rat  so call it an upside  you think maybe you could get me some clothing  yes i can just uh dont go anywhere  really not an issue  what what did we  boy that was the best scavenger hunt ever   scavenger hunt  your mom seemed to buy it  so she says  i think shes just so wigged at hitting on one of my friends that shes repressing  shes getting pretty good at that i should probably start worrying  well im back to being incredibly unpopular  its better than everyone trying to axemurder you right  mostly but uh willow wont even talk to me   any particular reason she should  how much groveling are we talking here  oh a month at least  xander come on i mean this is worse for her than anyone  she loved you before you invoked the great roofie spirit the rest of us   you remember huh  oh yeah  i remember coming on to you i remember begging you to undress me  and then a sudden need for cheese  i also remember that you didnt   need cheese  undress me  it meant a lot to me what you said  come on buffy i couldnt take advantage of you like that  ok for a minute it was touch and go there  you came through   there might just be hope for you yet  well
