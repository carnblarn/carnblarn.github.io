down and listen to country music the music of pain giles you are not gonna believe this its clear its whats gonna happenits happening now angel youve gotta be wrong  ive checked all my volumes its real theres gotta be some way round it some prophecies are a bit dodgytheyre mutable buffy has thwarted them time and time again but the codex has nothing in itthat does not come to pass  then youre reading it wrong i wish to god i were but its very plain tomorrow nightbuffy will face the master and she will die well have you verified the text so thats it huh i remember the drill one slayer dies the next ones called i wonder who she is will you train her or will they send someone else  buffy does it say how hes gonna kill me do you think itll hurt dont touch me were you even gonna tell me i was hoping that i wouldnt have tothat there was some way around it ive got a way around it i quit  its not that simple im making it that simple i quit i resign im fired find someone elseto stop the master from taking over im not sure that anyone else canall the signs indicate signs read me the signs tell me my fortune youre so usefulsitting here with all your books youre really a lot of help no i dont suppose i am  i know this is hard what do you know about this youre never gonna die do you think i want anything to happento you we just gotta figure out a way i already did i quit remember pay attention buffy if the master rises i dont care i dont care giles im 16 years old i dont wanna die hi honey you all right sure youre probably just fullfrom that bite of dinner you nearly had feel like telling me whats on your mind  mom lets go away what  anywhere just for a while a weekend honey a motherdaughter thing we can talk aboutthe embarrassing things you love to bring up  you know the gallerys open on weekends mom please isnt the prom tomorrow nightor spring fling whatever theyre calling it  i guess nobody asked you  someone but not the right someone see sometimes i do knowwhat youre thinking well then this probablyisnt the best time for this but i saw you eyeing it at the store i figured mom we cant afford this the way youve been eating we can afford it its beautiful i think you should wear it to the dance no i cant go to the dance says who is it written somewhere you should do what you wanthomecoming my freshman year of college i didnt have a dateso i got dressed up and i went anyway  was it awful it was awful for about an hour  then what happened i met your father he didnt have a date either he did thats a much funnier storythat you will not get to hear oh but it was a beautiful night and you had your whole life ahead of you must be nice kevin said hed bring everythingto the bronze last night he promised well never get everything ready in time he probably forgot its not that big a deal you dont understand im not mad he totally flaked on me on meand i dont even care god help me i think its cute there they are theyre watching cartoons thats so cu thats not cute thats annoying im annoyed right im furious  men i dont know why we put up with them i hear ya obviously kevin has underestimatedthe power of my icy stare oh my god kevin kevin buffy theres something on the news willow ive seen so much i thought i could take anything but buffy this this was different itll be all right im trying to think how to say it to explain it so you understand it doesnt matter as long as youre ok im not ok i knew those guys i go to that room every day and when i walked in there it wasnt our world any more they made it theirs and they had fun  what are we gonna do what we have to promise me youll stay in tonight ok buffy i like your dress take care soon soon ok so this master guy tried toopen the hellmouth but he got stuck in it now all the signs are readingthat hes gonna get out which opens the hellmouth whichbrings the demons which ends the world yes that about sums it up yes the part that gets me thoughis where buffy is the vampire slayer  shes so little did you get in touch with this brother luca as far as i can tell no one can hes disappeareddid send out one last global though  a short one what did it say isaiah 116 which i dutifully looked up the wolf shall live with the lambthe leopard shall lie down with the kid the calf the lion and the fatling togetherand the little child shall lead them  its warm and fuzzy for a message of doom it all depends where hes leading them to aurelius wrote of the anointed one the slayer will not know himand he will lead her into hell so luca thinks the anointed is a kid if the vampire that buffy killedis in fact not the anointed then it may well be  well then we need to warn her i dont intend involving her at all what do you mean buffys not going to face the master i am no youre not so im looking for a kid huhand hell lead me to the master im not going to send you out there to dieive waded about in these books for so long ive forgotten what the real world is likeits time i found out  youre not facing the master ive made up my mind  so have i i made up mine first im older and wiser than you and just do what youre told for once all right thats not how it goes im the slayer i dont care what the books sayi defy prophecy and im going nothing you can say will change my mind i know when he wakes up tell him i dunno think of something cool tell him i said it you fight the master and youll die maybe maybe ill take him with me help me its ok i know who you are  she what i told you something was going on with her she knew about this prophecy of yours  oh man what do we do we stay calm first thing  calm i think hes right calm may work for locutus of the borg herebut im staying freaked out  xander how could you let her go as my soontobe purple jaw will attesti did not let her go  how can we help her sorry to bring this up  but we also have an apocalypse do you mind how come shes in the club once the master gets freethe hellmouth opens and everybody dies i dont care im sorry i dont  right now i gotta help buffy we dont even know where shes gone no but i can find out well look whos here mind if i come in  make yourself at home shes gone  what buffys gone to fight the master  hell kill her rumour has it only were not gonna let it happen what do you propose we do about it look i know you can find this master guy hes underground right take me to him youre way out of your league kid the masterll kill you before you caneven breathe if youre lucky how can i say this clearly i dont like you at the end of the dayi pretty much think youre a vampire but buffys got this big old yen for you she thinks youre a real person and right now i need you to prove her right youre in love with her arent you the master is as oldas any vampire on record we dont know how powerful hell beif he reaches the surface ok heres my question the hellmouth opens yes where if hes underground and its rightwhere he is wheres it gonna open good point look you have a lookthrough the black chronicles willow could you check the local historiesfor any common denominators locations of incidents and such right ok welcome thanks for having me you should talk to your contractor  looks like you got some water damage oh good the feeble banter portion of the fightwhy dont we just cut to the nice shot this way what  youre looking at my neck what  you checked out my neck no keep your distance  i wasnt looking at your neck i told you to eat before we left youre not going to kill me with that thing  dont be so sure you still dont understand your part in this you are not the hunter you are the lamb now lets think about this the vampires have been gathering theyknow hes coming they will be his army  theyll be at the hellmouth the master last tried to rise at the harvest he sent some vampiresto get him fresh blood  where did that go down the bronze  the prom we have to warn them no well go you have toconcentrate on demon killing  my cars in the lot stay close together and be careful we will for someone whos allpowerfulyou sure do like to hide im waiting for you i want this moment to last well i dont i understand what if they get to the bronze before we do  we dont need to worry about that why not cos theyre not going to the bronze you tried it was noble of you you heard the prophecy that i was aboutto break free and you came to stop me but prophecies are tricky creatures they dont tell you everything youre the one that sets me free if you hadnt come i couldnt go think about that oh god the power by the way i like your dress  what was that its too late hes gone up shes dead  no shes not dead shes not breathing but if she drowned theres a shot cpr you have to do it i have no breath come on come on  why are they coming here not caring get in come on breathe breathe come on buffy buffy xander welcome back i was sitting where kevin and i used to parkand suddenly these things came at me  what do we do now weve gotta get to the
