genius and i sort of have a technical problem if i wanted to find out about someonewho emailed me could i trace the letter well you could pull out somebodys profilebased on their user name but they write the profile themselves rightso they can say what they want  true wow i had knowledge is there a way to find outexactly where an eletter came from the actual location of the computer thats a challenge  cos willows got this boyfriend malcolm leave willow alone  what do you mean thats none of your business  dave are you malcolm of course not  dave whats going on look ill talk to you later ok ive got work to do so do i im telling you something is going onits notjust willow  dave fritz theyre all wicked jumpy they arent sparklingly normal as it is  giles trust me i do i really dont know how to advise you things involving the computerfill me with a childlike terror if it were a nice ogre or some suchid be more in my element i suppose you could tail davesee if hes up to something follow dave what in dark glassesand a trench coat please i can work this out myself shes too close what do i do party whatever dave is into its large  what was the name of this place it said crd but i wasnt close enough to see what it was a computer research lab sunnydales thirdlargest employer till it closed down last year  what i cant have information sometimes its just somewhat unprecedented well my uncle used to work therein a floorsweeping capacity  but it closed uhhuh looked functional to mei dont have a clue what they were doing  and what do they need dave for something about computers right i mean he is offthechart smart we still dont know an enormous amount whatever is going on theremay be on the up and up  if crd opened it woulda been on the news i can tell somethings wrong  my spider sense is tingling your spider sense  popculture reference sorry i think were still at a standstill  short of breaking in breaking in this is the plan  im free tonight tonight it is a moment please of quiet reflection i did not suggest that you illegally enter data into the file so the bookwill be listed by title as well as author i came to check your database make sureyour crossreference table isnt glitching  cos i bet you havent gone near it im still sorting through the chaos you left hmm you here again you kidsreally dig the library dont you  were literary to read makes our speaking english good  well be going now well continue this conversation later were done  makes our speaking english good i panicked ive never felt this wayabout anyone before willow i know what you mean i feel like you know me better than anyone  i do do you think we should meet i think we should soon im nervous im not isnt that strange thats what buffy doesnt understand how comfortable you can make me feel buffy just makes trouble thats whyshe got kicked out of her old school how did you know that its on her permanent record you must have mentioned it i guess lets not worry about her any more i have to sign off ill talk to you later dont  youre a snob i am no such thing oh you are a big snob you think knowledge should bekept in guarded repositories where only a few white guys can get at it nonsense i simply dont adhereto a kneejerk assumption that because something is new its better this isnt a fad rupertwe are creating a new society here a society in which human interactionis all but obsolete in which people are completelymanipulated by technology thank you ill pass well i think youll be very happy herewith your musty old books these musty old books have much more tosay than in any of your fabulous web pages this one doesnt havea whole lot more to say what is it like a diary how odd i havent looked through all the volumes yetand i didnt what is it er nothing a diary yes i imagine thats what it is well its been so nice talking to you  we were fighting must do it again sometime bye now i checked the computer his file saysnothing about being allergic

gonna kill dave he tried to warn me warn you that he set you up  is she gonna be ok she was only grounded for a moment still if youd been anyone but the slayer tell me the truth hows my hair its great its your best hair ever oh yes i just dont understandwhat would make dave do a thing like that i think perhaps i do  does this look familiar to either of you yeah sure  it looks like a book i knew that one in the dark ages the souls of demonswere sometimes trapped in certain volumes they remained locked within the bookharmless unless the pages were read aloud unless im mistakenthis is moloch the corrupter a very deadly and seductive demon he draws people to himwith promises of love power knowledge  he preys on impressionable minds like daves dave and who knows how many others  and moloch is inside that book not any more  you released moloch way to go i didnt read it that dreadful calendar womanfound it and it was already blank so a powerful demon with horns is walkingaround sunnydale and nobodys noticed if hes so big and strong why use dave  why didnt he attack buffy himself i dont know and who read that bookit wasnt even in english  where was it in a pile with others that were scanned that released the demon no hes not out here hes in there the scanner read the book it brought moloch out as information to be absorbed hes gone binary on us ok for those of usin our studio audience who are me you guys are sayingmoloch is in this computer and in every computerconnected to it by a modem  hes everywhere what are we gonna do willow scanned him into her file it may bea futile gesture but i suggest we delete it solid  dont get too close ok ok so which file do you think it is willow thats probably it rightill just delete the whole thing stay away from willowit is none of your business so thats what malcolm looks like  so much for delete file this is very bad are we overreactinghes in a computer what can he do besides convince a perfectly nice kidto try and kill me i dont know  mess up medical equipment everywhere randomise traffic signals  access launch codes for nuclear missiles destroy the worlds economy  i think that nuclear missile thing capped it right yours was best ok hes a threat im on board with that nowbut what can we do about it first we find willow shes probably talkingto him right now god that creeps me out  what does he want with willow lets never find out ok im gonna check the computer lab and you guys call her home willow  no answer damn it it wasnt busy either so shes not on line  shes not home what did you find  willow isnt dave  hes dead how well it looks like suicide with a little help from my friends id guess fritzor one of their zomboids from crd ok you and i are going to willows house giles you find a wayto get moloch out of the net i have records of the ceremoniesbut thats for a creature of the flesh this could be somethingcompletely different then get ms calendarmaybe she can help you even if she could how do i convince hertheres a demon on the internet fine then come up with a better plan come on mom dad you have mail you have mail dad did you forget your keys again no more waiting a spokesman blamedcomputer error for the financial discrepancy binding ritual all fbi serialkiller profiles have beenmysteriously downloaded from  i got your message whats so urgent thank you for coming er i need your help but before that i need you to believesomething that you may not want to er theressomethings got into the inside erm theres a demon in the internet i know willow this isnt good willow willow ok any thoughts no more waiting i need you to see me see him how where  what about crd the research place  im guessing thats moloch central thats our best lead lets just hope giles can back us up you already know how exactly is that come on there have been portents for days power surges online shutdowns you should see the bones ive been casting i knew this would happen sooner or later its probably a mischief demonlike kelkor or its moloch the corrupter oh boy  i should have remembered you dont seem exactly surprised  who are you i teach computer science at high school that hardly involves the casting of bones wrong snobby you think the mysticalis limited to ancient texts and relics that bad old sciencemade the magic go away the divine exists in cyberspacesame as out here are you a witch i dont have that kind of powertechno pagan is the term there are more of us than you think well er you can definitely help me whats in cyberspace at the momentis less than divine i have the binding ritualsbut im completely out of my idiom well i can help  i think i hope i mean this is my first real do you know how he got in  he was scanned is the term i believe and you want him back in the book  buffy yeah  willow not at home looks like she was taken away  where are you crd whatever moloch wants willow foris probably in there ms calendar and ihope to get moloch off line heres a tip hurry welcome my love i cant tell you how good it is to see you with my own two eyes  willow malcolm this world is so new so exciting i can see all of it everything flows through me i know the secrets of your kingsbut nothing compares to having form again to be able to walk to touch to kill  back way back way here they come the first thing we have to dois form the circle of kayless right form a circle but theres only two of usits really more of a line we have to form the circle inside ill put outa flash i hope enough of my group responds wont moloch just shut you down im betting he wont figure it outtill its too late  hoping and betting thats what weve got wanna throw in praying be my guest i dont understandwhat do you want from me i want to give you the world  why you created me i brought these humans togetherto build me a body but you gave me life took me out of the book that held me  i want to repay you by lying to me by pretending to be a person pretending you loved me i do buffy
