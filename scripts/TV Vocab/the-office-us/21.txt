warehouse  fine actually perfect  perfect  you know what   there is another side to this place gentlemen  and i know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun exciting office  but do you realize that underneath us there is another world  the warehouse world  a world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life  life  the bowels of the office  these guys are down there they are real men doing real mans work  we are going to learn how a warehouse works  i think this is gonna work out great  because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job  and i havent been there in months

pan around there  this is darryl one of our warehouse staff   darryl what is your biggest fear   my biggest fear is that  someone will  distract us from getting all the shipments out on time  darryl is actually the foreman here and not roy which is cool  theres roy ridin the big rig  so roy is actually going to be marrying pam sometime this summer  and uh shes our receptionist sort of a brangelina thing  why   brangelina is the brad pitt and angelina   i dont understand  roy roy and pam its a ram  its a ram thing  i bet roy heard about you liking pam  i bet hell try to beat you up

here  or with jan  i mean we get along great fine  i guess the person i have the most in common with is  jim  halpert  heard theres a rumor going around about you know  you used to have a crush on pam and    oh no no no  no no its cool  cause i know youre a good guy and i know that that crush  ended a long time ago so you know were cool right   yeah no yeah definitely  you know its great with me

great  that is good stuff  in five years id like to be five years sober  that is an excellent goal  four and a half  ill tell you one thing i am not going to be one of those women  schlepping her kids around in a minivan  great  i want an suv with three rows of seats  well ill be honest one of the goals of these women seminars  is to feel out if theres any standouts women who could be valuable  addition to our corporate life  michael wants us to bond  so we need topics for conversation   ponies   no  how about rainbows    no  flowers   no  makeup  hey youre gonna hurt yourself   stand clear  mike get off of the lift please   im fine im fine i m fine  come on now  would youlook michael  well get somebody to clean that up  were da ones that gotta clean that up   damn it michael   we have to have this thing serviced  so guys gripe session  here we are  now we definitely live in different worlds  but we have a lot in common  we even like the same girls some of us  and thats gonna happen  you know were guys so  hey do you want me to go   no why would i you could   ill go  stay or  and a big walkin closet   thats part of my dream too  oh me too  great great  and pam what about you  what is your dream   well  i always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs  plant flowers on it stuff like that  since i was a girl  more seriously though a husband that i love  roy  and i love to draw  and i i did a little in college and id still love to do something  where i could work with art or graphic design in some way  shes real good  you know the company is offering a design training program in new york  i have a job right now so i cant really take time off  its its only on weekends and then a few weeks in new york  but im sure that i could ask corporate to help you out  its just that the weekends arent good because  theres always a million reasons not to do something  lets start with the warehouse  what bothers you as guys    you know   my priority is safety  okay  so it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift  playing with it like a toy it kind of gets under my skin okay    dontdont shush me  no i   that was just  that bothers me too   pam shushes me it drives me crazy  i hate shushing you know   thats the thing what okay what is our beef as human men  you know thats a good question hasselhoff   okay all right  what bugs us   good guys raggin on each other  thats what guys do and we love it  ll right lets talk about clothing  im excited about today i love girl talk  dress for the job you want not the job you have  you can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions  by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be  im not gaining anything from this seminar  im  a professional woman the head of accounting  im in the healthiest relationship of my life  i just think its insulting that jan thinks we need this  and apparently judging from her outfit  jan aspires to be a whore  i hate it when girls insist on taking them out  to new restaurants every weekend night and then theyre like  when are we gonna go on a date date   exactly   thats so hard  yeah and then they make you drive em to church the next morning  like gas aint free   yeah on our salaries man what do they expect you know   what take us out every weekend  you know what i mean    were not millionaires no you dont  i feel you  you dont feel us how can you  youyou know what    not literally  you say were the same  but we get compensated  very differently   yes  we work the same hours as you  and you just said we work a lot harder   uh you do so  but we get paid a lot less   word  like next to no benefits  i know god what is that    exactly  it blows it blows man  you know this would not happen if we had a union   thats what im talking about  yeah no   absolutely thats what we need  man see  thats what i been sayin man  we need to do this finally  is that necessary  cause you already sort of have a union of guys  its more than necessary mike we need this  roy you still have that card from the dock workers union    in my truck   man hook him up come on man   yeah you know what i think the problem is the chicks   union yeah   the problem is the chicks  and you gotta blame them  are you with us mike   welcome to the warehouse  another issue is inequality of pay between men and women  im sure that all of you have delt with that before  this is important ladies take a breather  jan i wanted  can i help you   i wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union   what  a union im not  and they have some good points  part of my job is knowing how to talk to women  lets be rational here  what are the pros what are the cons    the cons are that everyone will lose their job micheal everyone  office warehouse  what do you think the pros are here   dont talk to me that way please just  theyre gonna wanna hear this from you  you got yourself into this michael so   well were bonding down there  its too bad  i just dont wanna have to tell them something theyre not gonna wanna hear   come  on jan after all weve been through   michael michael  we have a history   michael  we have a history between us  dont say another word get yourselfdownstairs  im just saying that we have something okay whatever  you know what   we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line  this here is a runouttheclock situation  just like upstairs  sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out  of the language of the office now i know this might sound silly  but many women ask to go over it so fumble means   mistake  slip  right  par for the course is a golf term it means right on track  below par means worse wait thats doesnt make sense  what about second base   like if michael said he got to second base with you    does that mean he closed the deal   excuse me    i mean thats a baseball term right   i dont know what  michael was talking about   hey  hey  hows it going down there   its a complete well actually its exactly what youd expect so   how are the girls   good  we watched a video about our changing bodies   did you really    no  almost  something kind of cool theres this internship in graphic design  that jan was telling us about she made it sound like really great  nice well whats it all about   i think you should do it thats great  its really cool  cold front comin in to the warehouse   better put on your ski boots   happy new year darryl   hey darryl  you ever done this   are you married    im divorced  that must have been hard  it was yes  you were probably feeling really depressed and sad  and thats why you did that thing with michael  i think you should all spend a little more time about your careers  and less time on personal stuff  i think were all okay with the balance weve struck  at least you dont have kids you have no kids right    thank god   okay  lets take five i think we could all use five  how can someone so beautiful be so sad    hi  did you take care of the situation   yeah yeah yes   i i have essentially  excuse me   yes ive taken  excuse me  im told that theres been some interest in forming a union  and that michael supported it  obviously hes not a friend of yours  because he didnt tell you the facts so let me  if there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch  i can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that  they unionized in pittsfield and we all know what happened in pittsfield  it will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees  union dues and thatll be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs  so i would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings  and your futures just to send a message  if you have any further questions you can direct them to  to michael  dreams are just that  theyre dreams  they help get you through the day  like the thing about the terrace its nice  but um  i dont know it was just something i read in this book when i was 12  the girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom  and she planted flowers on it and i just loved that  just always kind of stuck with me  so youre not doing it  how  did you know   why not   just not no big reason   just a bunch of little reasons  come on  roys right theres no guarantee its gonna lead to anything anyway  roy said that   what  you have something you wanna say   you gotta take a chance on something sometime pam  i mean do you wanna be a receptionist here always   oh excuse me im fine with my choices  you are   yeah  its impractical  im not gonna try to get a house like that  they dont even make houses like that in scranton  so im never gonna  just gonna push this over there  this is not a good idea right here  easy does it okay  pizza  great equalizer  rich people love pizza poor people love pizza  white people love pizza black people love pizza  do black people like pizza   hey  look guys im sorry  sometimes jan can be such a bitch  hey watch it watch it we have a relationship  thank you to our host  hey michael   this aint over  excellent  is it good to be back  yeah i mean i love the guy stuff but  to run an office you need men and women  you know why  because you need to have  that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting  dundermifflin this is pam  hold please
