i should get one of those  you are so lucky jim  you are so lucky you dont have this problem  what was the ninth place prize again   a loaf of bread   cojinos pizza  great tasty terrific pizza  question do their pizza play dvds   dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company  he wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention  it is literally the highest possible honor that a northeastern pennsylvania  based midsized paper company regional salesman can attain so   what did i do to deserve this   are you sad that dwight beat you    no  are you gonna cry jim    do you need a tissue   i heard that you got a wedding dress   do you have pictures  yeah ill show em to you later  i should get back   talk to you guys later  okay cool  i have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding  and i have to do it in the office  and that can be kind of awkward  just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff  i just dont want to offend  angela or someone   thats what she said  i dont get it  grapes seductive  so you ready for the big speech this afternoon   well its not really a big speech youre still coming right   absofruitly  fruit grapes nailed the joke matter of time  and yes it is a big speech biggest of your life  speaker at the sales convention  been there done that went there again did it again  two years in a row consecutive  i just i miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job  because somebody gives you proof of it  sir youre awesome heres a plaque  what a whole year has gone by and you need more proof   heres a certificate  they stopped making plaques that year  what if i give a really long extended thank you   for instance thank you mr blank   thank you very very  that would look terrible  these are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained  and  you are the main act  when i was in the sixth grade i was a finalist in our school spelling bee  it was me against raj patel  and i misspelled in front of the entire school  the word failure  i cant do this  thats because youre incapable of doing it  because you dont know how because you have no skills  dwight theres no way i can possibly teach you  you need to know about public speaking by speech time  okay  but i can teach you enough so that you dont embarrass me or the company  okay deal ill do whatever you say no questions asked  well if you have a question you should ask me  ill try to think of one  dontdont try to think of a question to humor me  just try not to be such an idiot  is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice   insult  mom im sorry i know you and dad are chipping in for the wedding  but i do not want orange invitations  yes  well if you really want  hi yeah can i talk to one of your travel agents   im gonna take a trip  im gonna get out of town for a while  and go someplace  not here  where do i want to go   that is an excellent question  and one i probably should have thought about before i called you  i get here early every morning so i can set the thermostat  i like it a little cooler around 66 degrees  im more productive  maybe some people dont like it as cold as i do  but i dont care  but  seriously whats the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman    a saleswoman has a vagina  its a joke dwight   its not a sex ed class  but im right  yeah youre right about the difference between a man and a woman  but not about the punchline to the joke all right   the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman is boobs  hey do you remember the speeches that you gave   i do both of them   could i have a copy of one of them  no no they would remember  look it doesnt matter what you say  it just matters that youre saying something that people care about  yeah all right here we go watch this  attention everybody  attention please  i have some very great news from corporate  we had a wonderful quarter and as a result  all of you are getting bonuses for 1000   yeah    congratulations  you see that   you see how they responded to me  in that moment i had them   that is so great about the bonus   no no its not true  i was just talking so just go out there and say anything  theyll eat it up theyre a great audience  go ahead get the wallpaper wallpaper the ceiling if you want  excuse me  may i have your attention please   there has been an accident on 84 west  cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing  several  cars have flipped there is broken glass everywhere  several people are injured  do we know anyone who was injured in the accident   brad pitt  also there will be no bonuses   why would this affect our bonuses   theyre unrelated  is brad okay   he will never act again  also this branch is closing  what the hell is going on here    are we out of jobs   yes  this is karma for what he did to jennifer anniston  hes kidding dwight was kidding  and i dont know why because it wasnt funny  and it was just horrible   michael   yeah   you said we were getting bonuses  all right everybody in the conference room now  lets go  lets do it  cancel the wallpaper  as your leader and your friend  i sort of demand that you can all speak in public as i can  and did twice  you saw the plaque right   all right were all gonna go around the room and were going to make toasts  and that way we will overcome or fear of public speaking   you mean toastmasters   pam   im public speaking stop public interrupting me  actually this would be good practice for your wedding toast  yeah the bride doesnt really do have you ever been to a wedding    can i go   yes  good jim taking the initiative  so i am going on a trip  but im not really sure where im going yet  ita kinda open ended  so i was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions  you should go to hedonism   what is that   its like club med  but everything is naked  i was thinking more like europe or something like that  but good second choice  been to amsterdam  okay you know what   thats not a toast youre not standing up   to amsterdam   when did you go there   after my divorce  really for like how long   about a week ormaybe or month   i cant  jimmy listen to me  you do not want to go to

morning vietnam   okay you know what  this isnt working  because im not nervous in front of them   theyre my subordinates  no were not  yes you are i am the assistant regional manager   which means absolutely nothing  michael can you explain    well its mostly made up so  dwight is not going to do a good job its sad  and theyre expecting excellence because i did do such a great job  two years in a row i killed it was amazing  confidence dwight   dwight  if you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go   i can travel anywhere except cuba  and i will travel to new zealand  and walk the lord of the rings trail to mordor  and then i will hike mt doom  so you know just leave me alone  okay just trying to get some advice on my trip  oh please youre not taking any trip  you know i majored in public speaking in college  you did   and the first thing that they teach you  is that youve gotta be true to yourself  and you are all about authority  yes i am  the great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers  they were people of passion  so if you wanna do well today you gotta do what they did   which is  you gotta wave your arms  and youve gotta pound your fists many times  so as to emphasize your point  okay i didnt actually major in public speaking  but i did download speeches from some of historys famous dictators  like this one originally given by benito mussolini  okay look i know youre giving this speech on your own  but i wrote up a few talking points for you to look at   hope you dont mind   ill glance at it  its time dwight the grim reaper is here  the very best of luck to you dwight  thank you angela  whyd you pick the vr for the reception   roy has a connection its nicer than you think  youre  inviting jim   of course hes one of my closest friends  all right  ready  here we go   wow its a little bit bigger than i remembered  come on were down here in the front  i am just feeling under the weather  and i think that i will go home

michael scott  his mentor and boss  and until dwight comes up if he ever does  i wanted to say a few words about excellence  what makes a work environment excellent   well there are many things  i believe that do such a thing of that nature  and one would be humor  what is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman   i always set it at 69  maybe well use a dj  thats the one thing roys in charge of for this wedding  but all hes managed to do is set a date  well he did a great job june 10th is perfect  i want a june wedding ive always wanted one  ryan do you know when you would want to get married   actually i dont see ever getting married  ryan you should be more sensitive its obvious she likes you   and comments like that they just  i know what i said  im very sorry i did not know that you were wearing a hearing aid  and i just thought you were speaking  abnormally  and now the black guy from the police academy movies  a robot  michael winslow anyone   car starting  all right dwight schrute everyone  good luck that is a tough crowd  blood alone moves the wheels of history   have you ever asked yourselves  in an hour of meditation  which everyone finds during the day  how long we have been striving for greatness   not only the years weve been at war the war of work  but from the moment as a child  when we realized that the world could be conquered  it has been a lifetime struggle  a neverending fight  i say to you and you will understand that it is a privilege to fight   we  are warriors   salesmen of northeastern pennsylvania i ask you  once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour  i got a time share on key west that might be available  maybe thanks   you really think youre gonna go  yeah im definitely going  nice send me a postcard  jim has worked at the same place for five years  jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch  i dont know if i were a betting man  id say he will have a fun weekend in philadelphia  no revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself   some people will tell you salesman is a bad word  theyll conjure up images of used car dealers  and door to door charlatans  this is our duty to change their perception  i say salesmen  and womenof the world unite  we must never acquiesce  for it is together   together that we prevail   we must never concede control of the motherland for it is  together that we prevail   australia  ive always wanted to go there  im going  im a little nervous to run into dwight on his connecting flight to mordor  but other than that yeah i bought the ticket  nonrefundable  thats awesome where are you staying   i dont know  i feel like i have plenty of time to figure out the details but  when are you leaving   im leavingon june 8th  yeah  and im
