                so you found a band yet for your wedding   cause im in a band we really rock  yeah i mean its inevitable  i definitely overhear some wedding preparation but im fine with it  she hears me arranging my social life  and we both have to hear dwight order deer urine over the internet  so it evens out  so i got the save the date   yeah   yeah pretty stationary   oh thanks  i didnt get mine yet  there are a few people i decided not to invite  and that might make things kind of awkward but  its my wedding  and i dont want anyone there who has called me a hussy  episode 21  season 2 conflict resolution     yes thanks fantastic sams adult cut plus  comes with a shampoo and blow dry  were doing id photos today  gotta represent  on or off   off  what is on your face   is that a disguise   excuse me  clown paint  id badges are long overdue  security in this office park is a joke  last year i came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag  i sat at my desk all day  with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch  can you imagine if i was deranged   thats a nice tie  thank you that is   who makes that   i dont know  do you mind if i wear that for the photo   lets lets keep our clothes  its like child abuse  i say if jesus saw that hed freak out  hed freak out toby  i mean on so many levels and im supposed to work there   im supposed to  whats the deal e o   just letting oscar vent a little  we would use the break room but the photographers back there   whats the problem   angela  its just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace   since christmas  so what youre having a little spat   i forget are you guys dating   michael can i talk to you for a second please   heres how i usually handle this all i do is listen  you know these things just have a way of working themselves out  its like if you write someone a letter when youre really angry  they say to keep it in your drawer for a couple days  and then you just never end up sending it  what do you know about conflict resolution   your answer to everything is to get divorced so   okay  okay what   that was a right decision for me and my marriage  well thats not gonna fly here because in this office  it is till death do us part  assuming that we dont get downsized  pam  would you get angela and meet us in the conference room please   a mediators toolchest  okay well before we get started you should know  that there are five different styles of conflict  my shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style  can we go  i have a lot of work to do  this is important   the first style is loselose  whats the next one   just hold on please  okay if we do loselose neither of you gets what you want  do you understand   you you would both lose  now i need to ask you  do you want to pursue a loselose negotiation   can we just skip to whatever number five is  winwin or whatever   winwin is number four and number five is winwinwin  the important difference here is with winwinwin we all win  me too i win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work  okay so this is the disputed poster  now one at a time i want you to express your feelings  using i emotion language and no judging or you statements  i got this poster for christmas and i feel i want to see it every day  it makes me feel like the babies are the true artists  and god has a really cute sense of humor  come on seriously that   i dont like looking at it  its creepy and in bad taste and its just offensive to me  it makes me think of the horrible frigid stage mothers  who forced the babies into it  its kitsch its the opposite of art  it destroys art it destroys souls  this is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno   im talking about the kind  oh my god  lets see if we cant just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives   that are winwin  win  yes thank you pam  how about angela makes the poster into a tshirt which oscar wears  that way he can never see it and whenever she looks at oscar  she can see it winwinwin   no  thats no  well brainstorm own the solution   how about i leave it up   how about she takes it down   how about angela can keep it up on tuesdays and thursdays  okay that is called a compromise  and it is style three and it is not ideal  to sum up winwin make the poster into a tshirt  winlose take the poster down  compromise tuesdays and thursdays and the answer is  make the poster into a tshirt   winwin  win   fine  but  it is done   no youre all good  great  hey angela i didnt have your zip code  thanks  it was handdelivered  but i did get a save the date after all  its not my taste  you solved it  we can throw that one out  are those all the other complaints   i would like to see those please   i cant do that  you cant do that huh   now you and i have a conflict  i order you to give me that file  that  there no more conflict  i had to use the winlose on that it was not pretty  all right is that it   its all dwights  every friday at 400  i have a standing appointment with dwight  for him to file a grievance against jim  i tell him that im sending them to a special file in new york  that box is the special file in new york  oh god all right  why do i have to do everything   are you sure   oh hes sure just shoot  this is from kevin  he says stanley uses his miracle whip without asking  meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning  and the lights are too bright  creed  creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day  and wants a seat facing the receptionist  nice  you will notice that not one of these complaints is against me  actually i have a separate folder for complaints against michael  this is january through march of this year  how many of you have at one time  gone to toby to complain about another employee   and did you get what you wanted or were you merely listened to  you forget about your problem and you move on   that is outrageous i love this place  and it pains me to see all of the negativity  festering  today we are going to get everything out of these files  and into the open where it can be resolved  all right how about the phyllisangela dispute    you already did me  thats what she said  the thing is angela you are in here an awful lot  you have complained about everybody in the office  except dwight which is odd  because  everyone else has had run in with dwight  toby by the way what does redacted mean   there is a file full of complaints in here marked redacted  it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it  so i took their name off  there were a bunch of complaints about dwight  that were put in the redacted file about six months ago  wait if someone has a problem with me  why would they withdraw it six months ago   lets move on i volunteer  did anyone have a problem with me   all right pamela come on down  lets do it and okay just one complaint  actually it has been withdrawn  so that is no help to us next  wait what did it say   does she have to plan her wedding on office time   shouldnt she do that at home   who else   why dont we just warm up first  warm up emotionally all right   i have this kind of big secret about angela  and ive been really nice to her and i havent told anyone and  what the hell   here is a kelly complaint  ryan never returns my calls ah join the club  my voice mails real spotty sometimes  i didnt file a complaint i was just talking  to your hr representative  to my friend i thought i want that withdrawn  fine ill take your name off so no one will know  making progress   dwight tried to kiss me  what   and i didnt tell anyone cause im not really sure how i feel about it  that is not true redact it redact it  well im not actually making a formal complaint  i just really think we should talk about it  okay question when a name is withdrawn  does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in new york   sure  stanley  thanks for ratting me out  i didnt do it  i find that hard to believe  considering you have problems with every single person  in this entire office except bobblehead joe  someone complained that the mens room is whites only  stanley you know thats not true  i didnt say that  then why is there a picture of a white man on the door   okay phyllis you complained that angela is giving you dirty looks  and you tried to get off the party planning committee  no i never said any such thing angela and i are close  and also phyllis stanley says that you cry too much  and that bugs him  stanley and i are close too   we sit close  o kay  just take it  i cant believe angela  i went against my better judgment and i gave her a save the date  and now it turns out she complained about me to toby  well it was redacted  look if she wants an invite maybe shes just trying to be friends  dont take her side  well what does roy think about everything   i dont know i try not to bother him about this kind of stuff  you mean like your thoughts and your feelings   i know you keep saying its your space  even though theres no assigned parking but i keep forgetting   yes thats the problem  i guess so  okay well all settled then  i dont like you  okay ryan you told toby that creed has a distinct old man smell   i know exactly what hes talking about  i sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer  very nutritious but they smell like death  all right kevin you are accused of  making sexually suggestive remarks to angela  that made her feel uncomfortable  solution  angela you are to make sexually suggestive remarks  to kevin that will make him uncomfortable  i accept your decision  you know what dwight   maybe we should get our photo id taken together  that doesnt make any sense  well it saves time you know  cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning  walk in together perfect   smile  no  i never smile if i can help it  showing ones teeth is a submission signal in primates  when someone smiles at me  all i see is a chimpanzee begging for its life  this came out really well  there you go  this is humongous  am not a security threat  and my middle name is kurt not fart  what did i write   i have another complaint for jims permanent file  talk to michael i gave him the box  what box    but i didnt report your snoring  wednesdays tearful tuesdays  four years of malfeasance unreported this cannot stand   okay calm down  no you calm down  whose side is toby on  whose side are you on    him or me   stop  him or me  i cannot work with jim anymore   either he goes or i go  dwight   you choose  stop  one of us is out of here by the end of today  i am not bluffing  do the right thing here michael  okay i have served you loyally for years  i deserve this you know i do  you know your id says youre a security threat   you have till 500  oh look jim theres a sales manager position open in stamford  want me to call jan and tell her youre interested   i could put in a good word for you cause ill still be working here  transfer transfer everybody transfer transfer transfer  you two in the conference room with me  nobody leaves until we work this out  cage match  cage matches  yeah they work how could they not work   if they didnt work everybody would still be in the cage  okay so dwight in your own words  someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons  i suspect jim halpert  everyone has called me dwayne all day  i think jim halpert paid them to  yes five bucks each and it was totally worth it  this morning i found a bloody glove in my desk drawer  and jim halpert tried to convince me i committed murder  i think he may be the real murderer  jim halpert said there was an abandoned infant  in the womans room when i went to save the child  i saw meredith on the can  gaaad  this morning i knocked myself in the head with the phone  that actually took a while  i had to put more an more nickels into his handset  till he got used to the weight and then i justtook em all out  everytime i typed my name it said diapers  just a simple macro  you know these actually dont sound that funny one after another  but he does deserve it though  by the end of the day  my desk  was about two feet closer to the copier  yeah i just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom  and thats how i spent my entire day that day  the japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage  where they dig into your body very hard  and it is very painful and apparently some people throw up  but the next day they feel great  ive never had one they sound awful  maybe stamford would be cool  its a good market  higher volume  maybe we should both go  i have a girlfriend  sure you do dwight sure  hey theres like 300 more of these  lets get to them later  so youre gonna transfer jim or not   maybe i havent decided yet   lets get to work  i want an answer by tomorrow  actually tomorrows not good how about later in the week   fine  good okay  wait how about a group picture while youre here   i cant i only get reimbursed for the id photos  well thats what a computer camera right    you mean digital   yeah itll take like two seconds   all right everybody come on group photo for the newsletter  you gotta be kidding  come on everybody come on lets go creed kevin  oscar andale lets go  one two three smile   try to smile  we resolved a lot today everybody  think happy thoughts  alright im just gonna take it on three whether you smile or not  good lets check that out  all right one more well take one more   thatll be another 20  what   angela i want to talk to you about something   what   no pam dont   its about the save the date  pam it wasnt her  what   im the one who complained about you  alright come on one more time  i didnt know that toby was gonna write it down  i was just venting you know it was one day  thats terrible  and i took it right back it was like  lets pay mr  oh dear  price gouger  we can do this come on everybody  all right here we go  it was really hard getting a good picture of 15 people  he would not give me a discount  and eight tries added up  one two  didnt say three did i   but im sort of an expert at photoshop  so it turned out fine in the end  when people work together there is going to be conflict  you cant outrun your problems  hey pam its jim i have a doctors appointment in the city  so i probably wont be in till the late afternoon  just thought id let you know okay bye   okay jan will see you now  oh thanks  and that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing  but heres the thing about cage matches  sometimes you have to open the cage  and that is something that toby will never understand
