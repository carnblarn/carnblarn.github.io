for the plucking  show me that farm  pictures memories  look at that they grow up so fast   hey stranger  dont say that  that just sounds weird please  sorry i just feel like we havent talked in a while  well we have nothing to talk about dwight  just do your work  while you still can  when you become close with someone you develop a kind of sixth sense  you can read their moods like a booki  right now the title of michaels book is  something weird is going on  colon what did jan say  the michael scott story  by michael scott with dwight schrute  hey did you hear about your friends in pennsylvania  really  wow thats too bad  sorry scranton branch is closing  in your face  well i work here now  sucka   are you okay yeah great amazing  best physical condition of my life   what did

about this  until all the decisions have been made  you knew about this all along didnt you  jan told me just a few minutes before she told you  traitor you are a traitor  what about us michael do we still have jobs  i dont know probably not  this is the worst  it makes perfect sense that it would happen today  because i just received this in the mail  address and phone number  i dont want to blame anyone in particular  i think everyones to blame  if i get to stay and ryan is laid off  i will kill myself  like romeo and juliet the claire danes one  stamford connecticut  stamford connecticut  i worked in scranton for a really long time and  its  gonna be weird that its all disappearing  i mean i always knew that the branch would shut down someday  i just figured it would be because michael  sold the building for some magic beans   i couldnt be happier  im gonna take the severance and retire  my wife and i are gonna travel  i really couldnt be happier  its a blessing in disguise  actually not even in disguise  sometimes at home i answer the phone dundermifflin this is pam  somaybe thatll stop now  what does that mean  well  some of us are fired  and a few are going to connecticut  i dont know if i really wanna work here without pam  you know that cinderella song  you dont know what you got till its gone  that pretty much says it better than how i know  how to say it in words  hey mike darrel noble darrel  look i heard about the office   tuff break  i know i know  well ill land on my feet   yeah dont worry about me  i wasnt  so youll be okay too youre
