something that ive been pushing  that ive been wanting to push for a long time and corporate mandated it  i never actually talked to corporate about it  they kind of beat me with the punch  those bastards  but i was going to and i think its very important that we have this  im very very excited  thats the thing its a very sturdy paper  and on the back it says  what hello haha wait what  im sorry mister decker i think im losing you  hello hello yeah hold on one sec hold on one second   do you really have to do that right now  yes i do  i should have done this weeks ago actually  mister decker im sorry about that would you wait one second  yeah just one second thanks  hello thats it perfect so what i was saying was hello   thanks dwight  retaliation tit for tit   that is not the expression  well that should be  this is my bigger sale of the year  they love me over there for some reason im not really sure why  but you know i make one call over there every year just to renew their account  and that one call ends up being 25 of my commission for the whole year  so you know i buy a mini bottle of champagne and celebrate  and this year im pushing recycle paper on them for one percent more  i know getting cocky right   solitaire  yeah free cell   a 6 on 7  i know i saw that   so then why didnt you do it  im saving that   cause i like it when the cards go  who doesnt love that   hey oscar how you doing man  all right  a good week end going there   it was fun  oh yeah bet it was fun   oh hey this is oscar  martinez   see i didnt even know first thing basis  were all set  oh hey diversity everybody lets do it  oscar works in here   jim can you rapid up please  yeah  its diversity day jim  wish everyday was diversity day  you know what im actually gonna have to call you back  thank you sorry about that   thank you  get in the cars get in the car   thank you thank you very much  ok thanks for filling these i promise this will be quick  at diversity today our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations  we believe that 99 of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance  you know what this is a color free zone here  stanley i dont look at you as another race  see this is what im talking about we dont have to pretend that were colorblind   exactly were not colorblinds  thats fighting ignorance with  with intolerance  no with more ignorance right exactly instead we need to celebrate our diversity  lets celebrate  celebrate good times come on lets celebrate diversity right  yes exactly now heres what were gonna do ive noticed that uh  you know what heres what were gonna do  what if we go around and everybody everybody  say a race that you are attracted to sexually i will go last go  i have two white and indian  actually i prefer not to start that way  michael i would love to have your permission to run this session can i have your permission   yes  thank you very much  and it would also help me if you were seated  thank you ok  now at the start of the session i had you write down an incident  that you found offensive in the workplace   now what im gonna do is choose one and were gonna act like  a few other ground rules  why dont you run it by me and i run it by him  ok can we steer away from gay people  im sorry its an orientation its not a race  plus a lot of other racists are also intolerant at gays so  paradox  well we only have an hour   why dont we just refer to mr uh  mr brown  oh all right ok  first test i will not call you that  well its my name its not a test ok  so looking few cards ive noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident  which is ironic  because its the exact incident i was brought in here to respond to  now how many of you are familiar with the chris rock routine  very good ok  how come chris rock can do a routine  and everybody finds it hilarious and ground breaking  and i go into the exact same routine same comedy timing  and people file a complaint to corporate  is it because im white and chris is black  so were gonna reenact this with a more positive outcome  i will play the chris rock guy  i would like to see someone else pull this off  oh lets have someone who wasnt involve in the reenactment  ok i will play guy listening  great guy listening   ok anyone else remember  i remember  great youre the chris rock guy and youre the guy listening  kevin is a great guy  hes a great accountant he is not much of an entertainer  basically there are two types of black people  and black people are actually more racists  because they hate the other type of black people  every time the one type wants to have a good time  then the other type comes in and makes a real mess  ok im sorry im sorry hes ruining hes butchering it could you just let me  every time every time black people want to have a good time  some biiiip ass biiiip i take care of my kids   always want credit for something theyre supposed to do  stop it  what do you want cookie  now this is a simple acronym hero  at diversity today we believe its very easy to be a hero  all you need are honesty empathy respect and open mindedness   excuse me im sorry but thats not all it takes to be a hero  oh great what is a hero to you  a hero kills people people that wish him harm  ok  a hero is part human part supernatural  a hero is born out of a child with trauma or out of a disaster  that must be avenged   ok youre thinking of a superhero  we all have a hero in our heart  now i need you to take these forms  this is the kind of expresses the joint experience we had today  and i want you to look them over and sign them as a kind of a group pledge  i dont think i can sign this  i cant leave until you do  it says here that ive learned something  and i knew all this stuff already so  you know i could sign something that says that i taught something  or that i helped you teach something so pam wheres she   pam could we change something on this  michael can i talk to you candidly   sure  we both know that im here because of the comments that youve made  heres the thing this office i think its very advanced  in terms of racial awareness  and its probably more advanced than youre used to   thats probably throwing you off  its not throwing me i need your signature   ok i know you told me that several times  yes but youre not listening to me   yours is the only signature i need  oh ok  those are my instructions from the corporate offices  is to put your through this seminar for the comments that you made  and the only reason why i made copies for everyone was that you wouldnt be embarrassed  well here i am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training  and you dont   dont worry about dating  i wont   ok thank you  yep  i regret my actions i regret offending my coworkers  i pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty empathy respect and openmindedness  openmindedness is that a word  into the workplace in this way i can truly be a hero  signed daffy duck  hes gonna lose it when he reads that  hi is mr decker around  oh well could you just have him call me after lunch thank you  i pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart  i do believe in that part of the pledge that i just read  but a pledge come on who are we the girls scouts no  look the the guy mister brown he got us half way there he got us talking  well no i got us talking it got us nothing  he insulted us and he abandoned us  you call that diversity training i dont  were there any connections between any of us  did anyone look each other in the eye were there any emotion going on  no where was the heart i didnt see any heart  where was my oprah moment  ok get as much done as you can before lunch because afterward  im gonna have you all in tears  all right everybody pretty come on here we go its time lets do some good  hey we are not all gonna seat in circle in it so are we   get out  im sorry  no this not a joke ok  it was offensive and lame so double offensive  this is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here  ok lets go lets do it come on lets have some fun everybody  here we go take a seat cop a squat and thank you for coming in  diversity is the cornerstone of progress as ive always said  but dont take my word for it lets take a look at the tape  hi im michael scott im in charge of dundler mifflin paper products  here in scranton pennsylvania  but im also the founder of diversity tomorrow  because today is almost over  abraham lincoln once said that if youre a racist  i will attack you with the north  and those are the principles that i carry with me in the workplace  ok questions comments anybody jim   uhh is that it  yes i only had an hour to put it together   but im gonna add onto it later on  it was kind of hard to hear  uh yes that probably has something to do with the camera work anybody else   i have a customer meeting  yeah well if you leave well only have to  yes enjoy absolutely namaste  ok well since i am leading this  lets get down to business and why dont i just kind of introduce myself ok  i am michael and i am part english irish german and scottish  sort of a virtual united nations  but what some of you might not know is that i am also part native american indian  what part native american   215th  that fraction doesnt make any sense  well you know what

they moved to the unitedstates a year before i was born  so i grew up in the united states and my parents were mexicans  that is a great story thats the american dream right there right  thank you yeah  let me ask you is there a term besides mexican that you prefer  something less offensive   mexican isnt offensive  well it has certain connotations   like what  like i dont know   what connotations michael  no   it must have been something  no remember   im just curious  honesty empathy respect  jim  hello  i have something here i want you to take a card  put it on you fore dont look at the card  i want you to take the card i want you to put it on you forehead and  take a card any card  and i want you to treat other people like the race  that is on their forehead so everybody
