you about yeppers  i dont remember  i told you not to say it  do you remember that  yesh  i really dont want to talk about it  i dont mean to be rude but  i just i dont want to  comment on what happened  it sucked  i guess all things considered  i was lucky dwight was there  and roy was lucky that  dwight only used pepper spray  and not the nunchucks  or the throwing stars  hey man i never  got a chance to thank you  for stopping roy  thank you  thank you not necessary  and thus not accepted  i saw someone breaking the law  and i interceded  okay  ive got you something  dont want it  you dont wanna know what it is  dont want it wont open it  dont need it wont take it  citizens do not accept prizes  for being citizens  it was a little glass display case  for his bobblehead  that would have made us even i think  he saves my life  i get him a box for his desk toy  even steven  no dont call me a hero  do you know who the real heroes are  the guys who wake up every morning  and go into their normal jobs  and get a distress call  from the commissioner  and take off their glasses  and change into capes  and fly around fighting crime  those are the real heroes  angela roys check  hes coming in later to pick it up  man i cannot believe that  i missed the fight  it was crazy  you saw it  describe it please  well i heard some shouting  and i looked over  and roy was by reception  and you could tell  hes gonna punch somebody  jim says something  roy stops over there  all of a sudden bam  and roy goes down and dwights standing  there looking like an action hero  insane  well  good for dwight  okay i want you to be darryl  and ask me for a raise  because i need to try out  somebodys negotiation tactics on you  where did you get that  wikipedia  wikipedia is the best thing ever  anyone in the world can write anything  they want about any subject  so you know you are getting  the best possible information  okay darryl ask me for a raise  hey mike since roy left  ive been doing a lot of work and i need raise  hm thats interesting darryl  i think  cant hear you  what im saying is that  still nothing   okay see what i did  no  by leaning back  and by whispering  i established a  dominant physical position   nice   okay lets try another one  walking out of the room unexpectedly  and what happens in this one   thats surprise   okay  go ahead ask for a raise  can i have a raise  sex steve martin teri hatcher   what   what  no what did you say  i didnt say anything  i was waiting to see what happened  its interesting  its all the perpetrators advance toward the victim at highrated speed  his head was thrown back  his shoulders were on arm cocked  getting in attack position  perp grabbed the victim  i removed my weapons  from its secure hiding place  oh which is where  irrelevant  discharged at a distance of  little over a meter  and to the perpetrators eyes  nose and face area  rendering him utterly  and completely disabled  then i contacted the authorities  the end  thanks dwight  that is the bravest thing  i have ever heard  i cant imagine  what i wouldve done  i can  you would have left me to  fend for myself  like the time  we were on the ferris wheel  and that kid dropped a milkshake  on me and you just laughed  well that was funny thats why  oh it was  okay well the next time  that you get scared  that you think a murderer is in  your apartment in the middle of the night   okay   and you call me to calm down   you know what i didnt   can you stop   you can just call somebody else  because im not doing it  anymore ryan im not   well dont talk to me about calling people  theres a bunch of people back here maybe   i call you in the middle of the night   to tell you tell that i love you  guys   i dont think michael intended to punish me  by putting ryan back here with kelly  but if he did intend that  wow  genius   yeah   you ready for me  yes yeah absolutely have a sit  you know what actually lets go into the conference room   okay   nah you know lets stay here  lets go  yeah lets go over  tactic number six  change the location of the meeting  at the last second  totally throws em off  number 14  declining to speak first  makes them feel uncomfortable  puts you in control  i am declining to speak first  okay ill start  its pretty simple  i um think i deserve a raise  im on schedule to get one of six months  but i like that to be moved up to now  darryl you are good worker  and good man  i just you know  times are tight  i just dont think corporate  are going for this right now  are you wearing lady clothes  what  are you wearing lady clothes  those look like lady pants  no this is a power suit  that theres a womans suit  i do not buy womens clothes  would not make that mistake again  im gonna call roy man   okay   thiss gonna make him feel better anyway   this is stupid   you know what  pam would you please tell darryl  that this is not a womans suit  oh my god  thats a womans suit  youre wearing a womans suit  no i do i wear mans suit okay  ive got this out of bins  there were these huge bins of clothes  and everybody was rifling  through them like crazy  and i grabbed one  and it fit  so i dont think that this is  totally just a womans suit  at the very least its bisexual  who makes it  um missterious  and it is mysterious because  the buttons are on the wrong side  thats the mystery  hes got shoulder pads  and do you see that lines  okay would you stop it please  oh know that tip you off  its european ok  its european cut  michael the pants dont have any pockets  no they dont see  italians dont wear pockets  its been a really rough couple of days  this helps a little  hey you maybe wanna come over  and rave my closet  no i dont wanna do that  because im twice your size anyway  yeah he looks like hillary clinton  lets just do this in 15 minutes okay  can you stand right there  for one second  i gotta send some emails  negotiation is all about  controlling things  about being in a driver seat  and make one tiny  mistake youre dead  i made one tiny mistake  i wore womens clothes  so karen  how do you feel that roy tried to kick  your boyfriends ass over another woman  i feel great kevin thank you  you must been scared out of your mind  well you know it happened so fast  i didnt really have time to be scared  what happened exactly  i wasnt here so i havent  really heard the whole story  um well jim and i were talking  and roy walked in  looking super angry  and hes big dude you know  and all of a sudden  jim pushed me out of the way  and roy cocked his fist  and then bam dwight sprays  and knocks them on his butt  goodness  when i heard jim and pam had kissed  my reaction was to have lots of long talks  with jim about our feelings  roy just attacked him  im not sure which one jim hated more  lets get down to business  why dont you tell me  why you think you deserve a raise  well its simple mike  i mean we merged two branches right  now were shipping twice  as many orders as we used to  with roy going  we got a smaller crew  and im picking up all of his slack  so i think i should be compensated  fairly by getting a raise  what i cant hear you  i cant mike are you  you make very compelling argument  sorry i almost got you killed  yeah that was nuts  he could have broken  your nose or something crazy  its just so stupid  i mean getting back  with roy and everything  i mean what was i thinking right  no i mean you guys really  seem to have a strong connection  not anymore  its um its completely over now  well see  im sure you guysll find your way  back to one another someday  jim  i am really sorry  oh yeah dont worry about it  im going to give you a peace of paper  i want you to write down  how much you want  and i want you to slide it back  across the desk to me  why cant i just tell you  because that is the way  these things are done  in films  slide slide  oh god  come on be serious  im serious michael its a 10 raise  thats what i want  i cant give you that i dont make this much  come on be for real mike  i dont ill prove it to you  here is pay stub  are you serious youre earning this  plus perks yes  michael this is barley more than i make  youve been here 10 years dawg   no please please  im sorry some old folks got to hear about this  okay lets take 15 again  a boss salary isnt just about money  it is about perks  it is for example  every year i get a 100 gas card  cant put a price tag on that  okay if you dont want a gift  at least let me buy you a beer  or lunch at least  when han solo returns to the death star  in the millennium falcon  and shoots down the tie fighters  and saves the rebel cause  do you think he does so for a free beer   boy i    no  why youre so interested in buying me  something jim whats your angle  its like when he annoys me  and i want to screw with him  to get him back  he never sees its coming  but now i want to be nice to him  and actually give him something  and hes like an eel  i just cant grab onto him  its infuriating  maybe you just feel  guilty about all the pranks  well  yes thats probably what it is  so what do i do  i dont know  maybe you should go back out there  and sell paper so we can go on a trip  michael here is 15 i owe you   ah thank you  yeah  i heard you might need it so  heres the 40 you gave me  i didnt give you 40  in a way you did  yeah i heard how much michael makes  i still think hes way overpaid   i know  okay alright i gotta go later  okay heres the straight dope  no tricks no wikipedia  i talked to corporate and they told me  that i can only give you a 5 raise  thats because of you mike  theyre not gonna give  the working man more than a boss  what am i supposed do  get your own raise  you gotta get out there and earn son  im not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now  that is ridiculous  well when they merged  two branches together  they put you in charge  okay were shipping  more now we ever have   thats true   yeah thats true  you gotta call your girl  and get paid  show who wears the pants in the relationship   you know what i should   yeah you should  ive been a loyal employee  for a long time   you know what

god   ive got   you jade earrings  michael  no no no  youre gonna play like this  you give me a good raise  or no more sex  what are you writing pervball  just preparing for the deposition  this may be the first time  that a male subordinate  has attempted to get  a modest scheduled raise  by threatening to withhold sex  from a female superior  it will be a groundbreaking case  when it inevitably goes to trial  im so sorry pammy  i wasnt gonna  do anything but then  ive kept thinking about  you two together  i just thought you guys were  really good friends or  maybe he was gay or something  not that thats wrong  im sorry too  i just i think that  we both made some bad choices  so you gonna start dating halpert then  no  no he has a girlfriend  oh yeah  hey babe you broke up  our wedding for the guy  no there were a lot of reasons  you mean youre not even gonna  try to go out with him  i dont get you pam  i know  whats this   whats what  certificate of bravery  from the scranton police department  recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man  dwight k schrute  wow nice words around thats how a nice honor  please they hand it out to little kids  look theres

a break  okay no no no no  you do not try tactic number 8 on me  i invented the tactic number 8  im not going anywhere  okay toby  how about if you great  whats wrong with you  it was a weird day  i accidentally crossdressed  and then darryl made me feel bad  for not making any money  and then i drive up here  with stupid toby  and then your assistant is  all young and hot and i  okay michael  i can offer you a 12 raise but  you have got to ask for 15  thats ridiculous  im never ganna make that money  nope just  i just need you to ask for it  so i can record that  you asked for it okay  ah so  all right levinson heres the rub  i would like a 15 raise  no we can offer you 12  but you just said 15  negotiation is an art  back and forth give and take  and today both darryl and i took something  higher salaries  winwinwin  but you know life is about  more than just salary  its about perks  like having sex with jan  michael  so you wanna buy it for  your new house perhaps  yeah
