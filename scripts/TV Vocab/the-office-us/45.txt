vent  fortunately i have found it before  bat bat  bat bat  oh my god  bat  no everyone remain calm  there it goes  good bye  okay this is it  ryan is doing  my intro right now  dundermifflin cant compete  with the modern chains  and management is unwilling  or unable to adapt  their customers are dying off  i cant here  what hes saying  but he looks like  hes really into it  we have a bat in the office  the simple solution  would be to open a window  if we had windows  that could open  poop is raining  from the ceilings  poop  okay thanks  animal control  will be here at 600  at 600  no that is unacceptable  okay jim you are the number two in this office  you need to step up and show some leadership  im sorry what did you say  so weird  what whats so weird  the bat  i mean i know  i

hello everyone i am michael scott  hello im tom rollins  ceo of the teaching company  and id like to start today  by inspiring you  may i borrow  someones textbook please  thank you  what have we here  oh economics  very very interesting  you cannot learn  from books  replace these pages  with life lesson  and then  you will have a book  that is worth  its weight in gold  i know these are expensive  but the lesson is priceless  good  all right  i think youre inspired  shall we proceed  there are  four kinds of business  tourism  food service  railroads  and sales  and hospitalsmanufacturing  and air travel  this is your job halpert  what happened  that bread on your desk  i just picked it up  its whitehot  but jim  this garlic bread is cold  what  no  it burned me i  bizarre  no  one crisis at a time  if a vampire bat was in the us  it would make sense for it  to come to a sylvania  like pennsylvania  now that doesnt mean  that jim is gonna  become a vampire  only that he carries  the vampiric germ  so you want to start a business  how do you start  what do you need  well first of all  you need a building  and secondly  you need supply  you need something to sell  now this could be anything  it could be a thingamajig  or a whosiwhatsi  or a whatchamacallit  now you need to sell those  in order to have  a payday  and if you sell  enough of them  you will make  a 100 grand  satisfied  oh this looks great  id love to be there  but my daughters play  is tonight  damn it  you know one of the other  parents will probably videotape it  oh no you should go  well its important  to support to local art  and and what they do  is not art  okay im seeing some  confused faces out there  let me slow down  a little bit  break this down  okay  the more stickers you sell  the more profit  fancy word for money  you have to buy playstations  and beanie babies  michael   and products   what we normally do here is  more of a question  and answer type thing  well okay  i was just kind of getting going  yeah i know  um alright  okay well  we can do questions okay  very good first hand up  sir as a company  that primarily distributes paper  how have you adapted  your business model  to function in an increasingly  paperless world  we cant overestimate  the value of computers  yes they are great  for playing games  and forwarding funny emails  but real business  is done on paper okay  write that down  hey jim heres  the aspirin you wanted  oh thank god  i have such a headache  from that glare  what glare  the glare of  angelas crucifix  its blinding  i dont have a lot of  experience with vampires  but i have hunted  werewolves  i shot one once  but by the time i got to it  it had turned back into  my neighbors dog  extraordinary events  call for extraordinary actions   we form an allegiance   sure   to use sudden violence   okay  do you have the tools to turn  a wooden mop handle into a stake  what size  what do you say  to a customer  who wants to leave you  for the convenience  and savings of  a nationwide chain  i say  you will miss our service  and i absolutely guarantee  youll come back  has anyone ever come back  we dont want them back  theyre stupid  how far has your herfindahl index  declined since the merger  nice try  hows your  polacksayswhat index  what  thanks kowalski  can we get back on track here  by your own employees calculation  youll be obsolete  in the next five to ten years  wait ryan said that  what are you doing  you better not hurt  that little bat  animals cant feel pain  dont hurt that bat creed  its a living thing  with feelings and a family  flush him towards the door  on my go now  bat  kill it kill it kill it  i  am a hero  yeah sure  you know business  sitting up here  in your ivory tower  and your ebony tower  but you know what  i tell you one thing  dundermifflin is here to stay  but how can you compete  against a company  with the resources of  a nationalwide chain  david will always beat goliath  but theres five goliaths  theres staples officemax  yeah you know what else is  facing five goliaths  america  alqaeda  global warming  sex predators  mercury poisoning  so do we just give up  is that what were learning  in business school  but in the big picture  dundermifflin is the big picture  cant you understand that  no you cant  youre too young  ryan  has never made a sale  and he started a fire  trying to make a cheesy pita  and everybody thinks  hes a tease  well you know what  he doesnt know anything  and neither do you  so suck on that  it wasnt personal  business is always personal  its the most personal thing  in the world  when we get back to the office  pack your thing   pack my   you heard me  pack your things  i really wanna come out  good night mary beth  so youre cool to

your art was the prettiest art  of all the art  thank you  look  im sorry okay  i was just trying to do  my presentation  and of course  i was wrong to suggest  that dundermifflin might  ever go out of business  but you dont have to fire me  fire you no no no  you are moving to the annex  to the annex  where kelly is  a good manager doesnt fire people  he hires people  and inspires people  people ryan  and people will never  go out of business  youre the one who said  we needed more culture  this is culture to you  its her first try  yeah on van goghs first try  he drew the hands of  the peasants  meaning what  meaning real art  takes courage okay  and and honesty  well those arent  pams strong points  yeah exactly  thats why this is motel art  thanks for coming  pamcasso  sorry im
