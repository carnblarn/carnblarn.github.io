                tonight the scranton business park is having casino night  and we are converting our warehouse into a fullblown gambling hall  and i know its illegal in pennsylvania  but its for charity  and i consider myself a great philanderer  its just nice to know at the end of the day  i can look in the mirror and say michael because of you  some little kid in the congo has a bellyful of rice this evening  just  makes you feel good  excuse me how long is the wait for a table for two   i would never ever serve you not in a million billion years  its a nice tux  i know  it belonged to my grandfather  he was buried in it so family heirloom  so whats the deal  weve gotta pay for our own drinks  thats lame  come on itll be fun and besides im a roulette expert  impossible roulette is not a game of skill it is a game of chance   i can always kind of win at roulette  oh really   how would you do that   mind control  you cant be serious  are you serious   ever since i as a little kid like eight or nine i could  sort of control things with my mind  i dont believe you continue  it was just little things you know like i could make something shake  or i could make a marble fall off the counter you know just little things  thats ridiculous you know what   why dont you move that coat rack   excuse me everyone attention in the office please  jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers  and he needs absolute silence go ahead  okay ill try  oh my god  episode 22  season 2 casino night     i try not to think of it as lagging behind  its more of a david and goliath thing  well the fact of the matter is  that your branch is currently number four  of the five branches that i oversee and   top 80  michael  you know that im very serious here  jan listen i promise i will kick it up a notch  what   emeril oh actually while i have you  not that i have you or have ever had you  but were having our casino night tonight  and i think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here  i thought that you were their fearless leader   i am but your are the eva peron to my cesar chavez   i think you can handle it  oh come on   probably michael   come on itd be fun  i can hear it in your voice you need a break  goodbye michael  jan and i understand each other  the romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being  but weve remained good friends good friends with privileges  not now someday  okay everybody tonights event is to benefit the boy scouts of america   again we do that every year  well they need our money  they dont have cookies like the girl scouts  itd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering  well oscar if you dont like it  then you should concentrate on winning  because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count  will receive 500 to donate to the charity of their choice  and they will get a mini fridge compliments of vance refrigeration  so get your charities into pam  i for example am playing for comic relief  that doesnt exist anymore  comedys very much alive as are homeless people  no they stopped making that show  well then they need our money more than ever  you have to pick an approved nonprofit organization  theres a great soup kitchen in downtown scranton  delicious pea soup on thursdays  ill probably give the money to them  something with animals  or people  kobe bryant has a foundation and he is so hot  and he gave his wife the biggest diamond ring  i know he didnt do it  maybe he did it  we are giving money that has been gambled  why dont we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves  and donate that money to charity   oh and another fun thing  we at the end of the night are going to give the check  to an actual group of boy scouts right toby  were gonna  actually i didnt think it was appropriate to invite children  since its you know theres gambling and alcohol  and its in our dangerous warehouse and its a school night  and you know hooters is catering you know is that enough   should i keep going   why are you the way that you are   honestly every time i try to do something fun or exciting  you make it not that way  i hate so much about the things that you choose to be  okay you know what  i will not donate my winnings to comic relief  since apparently it doesnt exist  i am going to donate to afghanistanis with aids  who  i think you mean the aid to afghanistan  no i mean afghanistanis with aids   afghani  what    afghani  thats a dog   no thats afghan  thats a shawl   wait canine aids   no humans with aids   who has aids   guys the afghanistanannis  okay you know what  no no  aids is not funny believe me i have tried  there are certain topics that are offlimits to comedians  jfk aids the holocaust  the lincoln assassination just recently became funny  i need to see this play like i need a hole in the head  and i hope to someday live in a world  where a person could tell a hilarious aids joke  its one of my dreams   what are you doing   oh nothing  till death do us rock  theyre wedding bands  roy was supposed to pick the band  but hes concentrating more on the bachelor party now  wait wait where are you going  i mean  even if you dont hire a band you still have to watch the bands  pam these are people who have never given up on their dreams  i have great respect for that  and yes theyre all probably very bad  and thatll make me feel better about not having dreams   theres a kiss cover band in here  lets do it  im pretty happy these days  im getting married soon and im getting along with everybody at work  why did i talk to jan about transferring   well you know  i have no future here  i have already put down the deposit  do you understand how a deposit works   mike i am not having fire eaters in a paper warehouse  its casino
