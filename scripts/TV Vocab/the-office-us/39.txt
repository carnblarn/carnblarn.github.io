was already dead  and we schrutes use every part of the goose  the meat has a delicious smoky rich flavor  plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator  thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease  oh winwin   exactly  thank you jim  i like goose and its already dead  is it so crazy if we eat it  thats crazy its crazy  dwight you cannot keep

everybody get one of these  yep  terrific good  this is going to be the best christmas ever  my girlfriend carol is coming to our party tonight  and i have a little surprise for her  ive got  two tickets to paradise  pack your bags were leaving day after tomorrow  um taking her to sandals jamaica  allinclusive  allinclusive  you know what that means  right  yeah   oh i think youre supposed to put a toy in the box creed  and a happy holiday to you   carol  hi is michael around here  there she is  a christmas carol  hello  youre about five hours early to the party  oh youre such a blonde  hey everybody  i  dont know who you havent met yet  but i think this is one of them  this  is my girlfriend carol  this is just the front of her  show em show em the other side   what  turn around turn around  come on   get out of here  oh you get out of here   yes  if i may say  shes even prettier than you described her  oh ouch  michael i dont think theres anything wrong with the way you described her   thank you  i really need a moment alone with you  not as much as i need a moment alone with you  what is this  that is my christmas card  its a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip having a blast  skisons greetings  no see  we never went on a ski trip  i know i know   i went on a ski trip  right   two years ago with my kids and my exhusband  yes but what you didnt realize at the time was  that i was with you in a sense i was in your heart   michael  and next to your kids what  this is so weird  i dont understand  its a bold move to photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend  and her kids on a ski trip with their real father  but then again michaels a bold guy  is bold the right word  i think youre a really sweet guy   okay  but um  i dont know how to deal with  with like this thing  and and the proposal  and i dont think things are gonna work out with us  no no okay okay  you know what youre not thinking straight  you know what you need  you need  to think this through in  jamaicas largest fresh water pool  what are you talking about  i got us tickets  to sandals jamaica we leave day after tomorrow  you had better find the skimpiest bikini   there is  michael  and its allinclusive  yes  im sorry  no carol you walk out that door and it is over  i know  jim   um hey  hey  i need to give you your christmas gift now  because um  well ill just tell you  what  for the past few months  ive been sending dwight letters from the cia  are you serious  theyre considering him for a topsecret mission  theres his application  and this is where i made him list  every secret he promised hed never ever tell  last year my boss michael scott  took a day off cause he said he had pneumonia  but really he was leaving early to go to magic camp  so heres the gift  you get to decide what his top secret mission is  sorry i didnt wrap it  you know what  i really dont think i should be doing this stuff anymore though  oh   just cause of the promotion  oh yeah  just feels a little bit like uh  no i get it  of course  okay  oh  i feel like theres a chance for me to start over  and if i fall back into the same kind of things i used to do then  what am i doing  id  like everybodys attention  christmas is canceled  you cant cancel a holiday  keep it up stanley and you will lose new years  what does that mean  jim take new years away from stanley  michael whats going on  carol and i  split up  amicably  and i just dont think it would be appropriate  to celebrate under the circumst  will they still air rudolph  thats not fair   are we going to cancel hanukkah as well  fine  have your party  just no guests  but we invited guests  well you know what phyllis  all of your guests  would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway  leaving  your life a stupid rotten mess  okay  it hurts  i know  it hurts my heart  it hurts my stomach  hurts my arms  okay well why are you laying like that  thanks  how did you push away the bad thoughts  like what  like maybe  the real reason they left  was because  there were things  they wanted you to do  in bed  that were  wha um  foreign and scary  ii dont believe  and not that you didnt wanna try them  some wine might have helped  do you know what im referring to  i dont need to know   michael  yep  sorry to interrupt  it appears were one bathrobe be short  take it from toby  copy  pam would you like to go to sandals jamaica with me   no thank you  its all okay  hey dwight  some pretty nice robes there  why  phyllis i need you to pick up green streamers at lunch  i thought you said green was whorish  no orange is whorish  uh so i had a couple of ideas  to make the stamford people feel more at home  each year we have a christmas raffle   okay  it would never work here  okay  um another idea was   karaoke  no  a christmas drinking game   yes  god help you  what  these are all terrible ideas  and none of them are on the theme of a nutcracker christmas  i think you should leave  youre kidding  you tried this out  and its clearly not for you  its time to go  come  on  please thank you  okay  thank you very much   what are you doing  we are getting rid of everything  that reminds you of carol  hey whats ahaps  carol  no  oh look at this  your old condo closing papers  its riddled with carols name  i wish i could throw this in the box  why dont you just buy the whole song  i dont have to buy it  i just wanna taste it  thats all  i just want a little taste of it  oh look at this she saved you 2000  cause they failed to report a mold problem  but wouldnt that affect the final  how did she  ohoh i see what she did  that is good  that carol is one smart cookie  this is an old adage  but they say that when you find true love  you know within the first 24 hours  with carol  i knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day i met her  i feel like ive been kind of cold to karen  and theres no real reason for it  i mean its not like shes ever done anything to me  so i think i probably shouldnt be cold to her  hey karen  sorry about that meeting today that was really crazy  yeah right im so glad you said that  because i dont know how those meetings usually go  um usually like that  does anyone ever stand up to angela  i think one of her cats did once  she came in with scratches all over her face  right  umi really liked your karaoke idea   oh cool yeah  that could really be fun  you guys do a raffle  yeah we do a raffle   hey kev  hey  this should have been up yesterday  itll be all right  what is that  the committee to plan parties invites you to a margaritakaraoke christmas  theres no such thing as the committee to plan parties  there is now we just started it  well you cant just start a committee  you have to have funding  whats your funding  200   whats ours again  um 201   right  hey  a margaritakaraoke christmas party  that sounds like fun  no that is not a party  theres only one party and its hosted by the party planning committee  and it starts at 300  then why are there two flyers  i understand that this is confusing for everyone let me explain   theres a party that starts at 300  right  and then theres a way more fun party that starts at 245  right  and if youre interested in the way more fun party  all the info can be found here on our more brightlycolored flyer  i didnt see where it was  yep looks like the scranton people and the stamford people are  finally coming together  and thats what you want right  i think thats a really good  pam and karen  i am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning immediately   you cant do that  as ranking n3 in this office   im n3  youre n4   yeah but im n3  uh no  you must turn over to me all christmas decorations  and party
