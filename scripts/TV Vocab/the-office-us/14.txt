during your performance review  are your concrete ideas to improve your branch  well surely this  because of what   happened uh at our meeting in the parking lot of the chilis  review is anything but a formality michael  and uh i expec you to forget anything that you think may  have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior  im thinking about you  that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior  i dont see how thats unprofessional   michael  yeah   are the cameras in there with you     in your office   no  they are not  yes they are  thats my girlfriend  i heard they made out and had sex  i heard they just made out thats it  well i heard they made out   and had sex  dont talk about it  office romances are nobodys business but the people involved

 hold on sorry  yes pam  michael its time for the suggestion box meeting  im kind of in the middle of something i wish you wouldnt interrupt  you told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when jan was here  i did not not use those words  id like to sit in on that meeting is it happening right now   no its in like 10 minutes   everyones waiting in  the conference room  great very good  why are we here   because i value your opinions  now i know a lot of you dont think that i read your suggestions  but i do  i just sift through them every week  and i really look and scrutinize  to see what you guys are writing  so lets just uh read some of these suckers okay   alright number one  what should we do to prepare for y2k   what should we do to prepare for y2k   i thought you read these every week   well obviously this one got stuck in the box   that happens occasionally  it happens occasionally  and so  one down next suggestion  we need a better outreach for employees fighting depression  okay alright enought with the jokes  nobody in here is suffering from depression  that sounds serious michael  well yeah who wrote it    tom    tom then it is a joke  because there is nobody in here named tom  tom  he worked in accounting up until about a year ago  tom  oh that guy that guy was weird   alright next suggestion  next suggestion  argh badoo badoo  you need to do something about your bo  you need to do something about your bo  now  i dont know who this suggestion is meant for  but its more of a personal suggestion  and its not an office suggestion  and far be it from me to use this as a platform to embarass anybody  arent the suggestions meant for you   well toby  if by me you are inferring that i have bo  hen i would say that that is a very poor choice of words  micheal he wasnt inferring he was implying you were inferring  was i creed   okay well you know what i am implying  is that when were on an elevator together  i should maybe take the stairs  because talk about stank  not that i would ever say something like that in public  and i never have and i never will  just think its something that we should all be aware of  okay   now that weve learned this lets continue  see this is good were learning and were figuring some stuff out  you need to do something about your coffee breath   you need to do something about  shut up shut up shut up  okay i dont think you people are grasping  the concept of the suggestion box  sometimes you talk to us real close  yeah is that hard for you   alright well   well when you have coffee breath its hard  ill work on that okay  okay lets keep lets keep going  what do we have here  we have  somebodys piece of gum  somebody put a piece of gum in there  this is not aa garbage can  this is the future of our company  this is not a place for gum okay   i dont want to have to read these tomorrow  yeah who wants to come in on a saturday   yeah what    alright next suggestion   next suggestion  dont sl okay thats blank  dont sleep with your boss   do you think this is referring to you boning jan    i cant i cant alright please sit down  i dont understand why youre so upset  im going to sit over here youre going to sit over there  let me ask you this  please sit yourself down   let me ask you something  what michael   where did you get your outfit   youre going to give me this raise  i deserve this raise  yes  yes  yes   the least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation   yes why are you going to give me this raise   why   because im awesome   i am awesome   i just dont understand  why you have to pretend like nothing happened  because nothing did michael  it im not going to say anything more about it  and i would advise that you do the same  look michael    oh my god  im sorry am i interrupting  oh god were you guys making out   no dwight come in   great  what do you want dwight   i am ready for my performance review  okay great your performance has been adaquate  you may leave goodbye   is this how youve been conducting all the reviews michael   you want to talk now  good okay dwight leave  oh wait i would like to discuss my raise  why on earth would we give you a raise   that is an excellent question  thank you for asking  let me bring up one word dedication  i  have never been late  also  i have never missed a day due to illness  even when i had walking pneumonia  i even come in on holidays  you do  how do you get in   i have a copy of your key   thats a serious offense  that is a serious offense  very serious  as is toying with a mans heart  oh michael for god sakes  id also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace  okay third wheel why dont you do that   for instance the time brought in deer jerky for the whole office  that was deer  gross   oh god did not  you liked it   jan have you ever had deer  no  its a delicacy and you know what its an aphrodisiac  so when were done here you guys could go over to the antler lodge  sample some deer and talk about my raise  what do you say jan  okay heres what im going to do im going to step outside  collect my thoughts and i will return in about 10 minutes   okay you just clear your head  thank you dwight  i know its your job i know you have to ask  but i promise you im not going to discuss it with him  im certainly not going to discuss it with you  do you have a light  and in conclusion i think lex luther said it best when he said  dad you have no idea what im capable of   thats from superman   smallville  and that is why i feel i deserve this raise  do you think michael and jan actually  i dont really want to picture it but thank you pam  how do you come back from that   you dont  i dont think come all the way back you know  especially working together  no i mean doing that with michael  how do you come back from that as a human being   oh yeah no i dont think you can  im heading back to new york  allan and i will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow   okay good   wait wait wait no no no  come i just i just want to know why  michael now is not the time or the place  okay so youre saying that there is   a different or place  no   that we can have this discssion  i am saying  we are never gonna have this conversation  well okay never as in never ever ever   or never as in theres no chance  never for me always means never ever ever  from the horses mouth   what is the dealio   you know michael   am i too short   michael   it has nothing to do with your looks okay   its your its your personality  i mean youre obnoxious and rude  andandand stupid  and you do have coffee breath by the way  andand i dont agree about the bo  but you are very very inconsiderate   really   really youreyoureyoure   youre a great guy okay   i appreciate that thank you  you were very sweet  and you stayed up with me and talked to me  and cried with me and i appreciate that  no i wasnt i wasnt crying  but i am just not in the place right now where im looking for a relationship  so we can still work together  we can still be friends but  okay   so my looks have nothing to do with it  jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now  and it doesnt matter how great a guy i am  and that is all i needed im good  i can go home now  hey   its 1220 where the hell is dwight  no idea  never missed a day my ass  im here  im here  im here  its okay
