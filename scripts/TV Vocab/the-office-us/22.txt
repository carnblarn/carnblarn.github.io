please  you need to get something for your girlfriend   girlfriend yes  and the reason i didnt get anything for this particular person  who shall remain nameless  is that shes not really the kind of person  youd think would be in to valentines day   shes kind of  tightly wound   exactly  okay well sometimes the gift is really about the gesture  you know like what it means instead of what it is  you mean like a ham   no not like a ham  its about doing something  so that the person knows that you really care about her   okay i get it  that you remember her  thats great okay shut up i know exactly what to do  how about you craig  did you lose anyone   oh man jan called me in september  and shes like you gotta fire four people  and i was just like what  you know   did you   no i just ignored her  shes the worst  well shes our boss  she aint my boss dude i dont work for that bitch  hey come on   you know thats not  what    just cool it  you like jan   how can you like jan   maybe because shes my girlfriend  was or not my girlfriend shes   we hooked up and  you hooked up with jan   that was just you know months ago  it was just once god its just stupid  just forget it   yeah lets change the subject  yeah yeah  i dont know what hes thinking  but i would just be so psyched if we just dated forever  well take it slow  cause it seems like a lot of the time  things like that need to  soda  cool  hey so do you want to do something tonight   oh no not while im here  i mean i know that its valentines day or whatever  but theres totally no pressure at all of any kind whatsoever   so  i cant tonight  i have plans with my friends  okay   thats cool i  okay   i completely understand  cool  okay   josh porter stanford  nice to meet you  and  michael scott scranton

im not nervous  well i mean i guess id be lying  if i didnt say i was a little nervous  the new cfo is judging me on this too  and well it is michael so  yeah im very nervous  so with the 12 new local accounts we had a total of 4 organic growth  which was just above our preyear targets   thanks very much  thank you  okay michael  what is a business   is it a collection of numbers and sales reports   sure but as you know david and jan it is much more  life moves a little slower in scranton pennsylvania  and thats the way we like it  cause at dunder mifflin scranton  were not just in the paper business  were in the people business  lets meet some of the folks who make scranton branch so special  this is stanley hudson one of our talented salesmen  an africanamerican father of two  stanleys dedication is no doubt one of the hallmarks of the foundation  of the business were hoping to build our basis on  yeah i shot a bunch of footage around the office  edited it together on my mac  was thinking about entering it in some festivals  probably wont you know not what this is about  and finally pam beesly  look at her look how cute  not bad at all  as the receptionist pam is truly the gateway to our world  well i hope this gave you  a little taste of what life is like here at dunder mifflin scranton  what its like to walk a mile in oscars shoes  or try on phyllis pants  next time youre in town give us a call  stop on by  im sure youll be greeted by a big smile  and a how you doing pal   maybe even one of angelas famous brownies  and youll know that youre home  great scott    questions   okay okay thank you michael that was great  yes thank you  but for right now what id really like to know about  is the branchs performance  so do you have that information as well   yes absolutely david  get that for you i    can you sign   yeah  oscar   nothing for me   join the club   whos it from   my mom  its frustrating cause wed be so perfect together  you know what  heres the deal kelly  it would be really nice if he was into you right   it would be great but he isnt   you know  yeah but it would be so great   if he was  well hes not though  so you just gotta suck it up  you just gotta move on try to have some fun  come to my poker game tonight  okay cool  is it okay if i invite ryan   and that about does it thank you  okay  craig  yeah heres the deal  i did not understand this was supposed to be a  full on like report or whatnot  im sorry what did you think financial presentation meant   i was under the impression  this was more of like a meetandgreet type of deal  so does that mean that you dont have the numbers on your branch   that is correct yes  craig you realize that we are trying  to decide whether drastic steps need to be taken  look im sorry i didnt know  well the point is that this doesnt exactly bode well for your branch  oh man you know what   michael made that stupid movie he doesnt get in any trouble  maybe i shouldve slept with you too   okay okay  no no no   all right  im not i just  i just dont know what to do anymore michael  i mean im probably going to get fired   no youre not  yeah i  michael the cfo thinks that we slept together  dont you understand  people get fired for much less  and i just cant believe that you told everybody  and we didnt even sleep together   technically we fell asleep in the same bed   so  oh god  michael it was months ago it was once its over  do you understand   yes im sorry  ill fix this ill talk to him ill talk to david  surely you cannot be serious  i am serious and dont call me shirley  airplane  women are like wolves  if you want a wolf you have to trap it  you have to snare it  and then you have to tame it  keep it happy care for it feed it  lovingly the way an animal deserves to be loved  and my animal deserves a lot of loving   hey babe  hey   you almost ready to go   i guess yeah   whats wrong   nothing  its just that i had to sit here all day while phyllis got  like an entire garden delivered to her  what youre mad at me   i mean i know that we said no big gifts  but i was kind of hoping youd get me something for valentines day  well valentines day isnt over  lets get you home and you are gonna get the best sex of your life  you understand this is  a very serious situation  no no no yes i okay well  all right heres the deal this is my fault  this is totally on me before you guys came in  i was talking to the guys we were all chatting  and i made a joke  a really dumb joke  and craig the idiot took it seriously    you made a joke   i did it was stupid  and craig you saw him  hes not the sharpest tool in the shed  although he is a tool  well i dont need to explain to you  that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss  i know it was borderline at best  and and jan is a fantastic executive  and has all the integrity in the world  and im really sorry  itll never happen again  its fine lets just just forget it  good   heading out   yeah  all right beesly hey happy valentines day  bye   good night pam  night phyllis  thank you again for that really   it was very nice  no big deal   really sorry again  oh no its its okay  its okay  so happy valentines day  yeah happy valentines day  oi veyschmear
