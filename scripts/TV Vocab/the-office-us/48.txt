decided to shun andy bernard for the next three years  which im looking forward to  its an amish technique  its like slapping someone with silence  i was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday  for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna  jim could you please inform andy bernard that he is being shunned  andy dwight says welcome back and he could use a hug  okay tell him that thats not true  dwight says that he actually doesnt know one single fact about bear attacks   okay no jim  you guys  tell him bears can climb faster than they can run  tell him  and nah thats too far  damn you   the office us  3x20 safety training  today is safety training day  toby is leading ours upstairs  but i am giving everyone a little bit of a treat  we are going to listen in on darryls presentation to the warehouse  and if i know darryl it gonna be zoppity  now  this is the forklift you need you need  a license to operate this machine  that means the upstairs office workers cant drive it  quiz mike   should you drive the forklift  i can and i have  i said should you you should not drive it  you should not drive the forklift  youre not allowed to drive it  its not safe you dont have a license  guys im not the only one whos driven the forklift   pudge has driven the forklift  madge  i thought your name was pudge  no its always been madge  okay   her  her yes her is qualified  to work a dangerous machine you are not   okay  ah   fine  do you understand that  yesh  we do safety traing every year  or after an accident  weve never made it a full year  this particular time i was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf  when one office worker who shall remain nameless  kicked the ladder off from under me and yelled  hey darryl hows it hangin  and i fell and busted my ankle and  im legitimately scared for my workers  the bailer can flatten  a car engine  it can cut off your arm and crush your entire body  without skipping a beat  yeah  its on  how many people a year do you think  get their arms cut off in a bailer  bail er i hardly know her  damn it michael pay attention man  anybody wanna take a guess  five bucks says its over 50   you really wanna bet  anybody  ever since march madness ended i am so bored   how many  okay youre on  ten people michael  ten people  would you like to be one of them  dont worry about it well go double or nothing  on what  i dont know well figure something out  these are very dangerous machines down here  and the upstairs workers michael  should not go anywhere near them  yes yes  but it wouldnt be the worst th  it would be the worst thing in the world  what the hell is wrong with this man  its a big red trash compactor  its not a trash compactor its a bailer  okay i got it i got it  only on the rarest of occasions  no do not touch it  theres no occasion for you to go near this stuff okay  toby now has the floor  and he is going to try not to screw this up  like everything else in his life  let me rephrase that  i believe that you can do safety training  and make it sound just as good as darryl  here we go  okay um one thing youre gonna wanna look out for  is carpal tunnel syndrome  its recommended you take  a tenminute break from typing every hour  for your circulation  youre gonna wanna get up out of your chairs and uh  and move around about ten minutes every hour  yes good fine   like stretching and  um  yeah your computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes  so its also recommended that you step away for about  about ten minutes every hour  wow that is that time really adds up  thats like a half an hour every hour  take them at the same time  okay you know what youre making it sound kind of lame  so skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff  like sometimes computers can explode can they not  no no  um you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan  of some sort in case it gets drafty   what about a longsleeved t  well thatll work  long johns a shawl  you know anything that warms you  you know what i think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom  sorry he is very lame  lets see  seasonal affective disorder  a depression that includes weight gain fatigue irritability  brought on by the low light of winter  thank god we only had the bailer to deal with  yeah that dim light is a bitch aint it  okay guys you know what  i didnt interrupt when you were having your presentation  actually you did  yes  okay lets do another one this is a good one  a particular concern for office workers  is a sedimentary lifestyle which can contribute  sedentary  yes which can contribute to heart disease  heart disease kills more people than bailers  thats called having a fat butt michael   its  yeah yeah thats fat butt disease  thats what youre suffering from fat butt disease michael  excuse me sea monster you weigh like 1000 pounds  yeah i bet youd like to swim with this sea monster wouldnt you  dude please tell your girl to shut up   what  kelly you insulted the gentleman   please apologize  are you kidding me  all right we out of here  darryl i didnt walk out in the middle of yours   so i  yeah but ours was real michael   yes  thats what were trying to tell you  its serious down there  we do dangerous stuff man this is shenanigans foolishness  nerf ball  you live a sweet little  nerfy life sittin on your biscuit  never havin to risk it  okay  what nerf isnt cool anymore  darryl thinks hes such a man because he works in a warehouse  well big deal  i worked in a warehouse mens wearhouse  i was a greeter  id like to see darryl greet people probably make em feel like wimps  not me i  hello im michael welcome to mens wearhouse  we have a special on khaki pants today  this is one example  ten  really ten thats your guess  youre a professional accountant  theres like ten green ones    im gonna say 50  51  oh dont be that person  its a strategy   its called being smart  thank you  i dont know how the whole betting thing started but its fun   ten  kevs out  jim wins  that is not fair  he has spent hours up here at reception with you  hours and hours  okay okay guys  no constantly like for years   okay  pam  depression is as scary as a bailer right  i dont understand the question  working in a office can lead to depression  which can lead to suicide  i mean this is really serious stuff   yeah  i i  nobody commits suicide  because they work with a bailer  and yet those guys are making fun of me  calling me a nerf that  its really hard to demonstrate depression  their safety training had visuals  yeah  you are  so right  they have visual aids and all we had  were the facts you dont go  to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity  you go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball  your hair sticks up straight  and you know science  so youre okay  indubitably  they use props  they use visual aids and they just made us look like dopes  idiots  god what are we gonna do  i dont know i dont know  because you know what our killer is   depression  wolves  depression   visual aids  yes  a quilt depression quilt  no time to sew a quilt  i got it  give me the number for the giant
