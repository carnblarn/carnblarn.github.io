meeting with jan and she did said that it could be this branch that gets the axe  are you sure about that  pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings  pam information is power  so you cant say for sure whether its gotta to be us or them  no no no stanley no you did not see me in there with her  i said if corporate wants to come in here and interfere then theyre gonna have to go through me right  you know you can go a mess with joshs people  but im the head of this family  and you aint gonna be messing with my children  if i left what would i do
