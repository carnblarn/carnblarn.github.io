that  those are drawings in case  the writing didnt really put a picture in your head  and there he is in the flesh agent michael scarn  now we know what he looks like  first guy says well im an

this is a movie  i mean this is for all of america to enjoy  you took something that doesnt belong to you   dwight do you want to  brought it in here made copies of it  the lead role of agent michael scarn   thats delicious i love it  we would probably be upset with ourselves  if we went this whole night without talking business  so dunder mifflin can provide  a level of personal service to the county  that the warehouse chains just cant match   well we are out to save money  whats the bottom line  blah blah blah blah blu bad be bah  thats why i wanted a signal  between us  so  i wouldnt have to just shout nonsense words thats her fault  did somebody say babyback ribs   i dont think christian has time for that   michael  i have time  i want my babyback babyback babyback  chilis babyback ribs  inside the fbi agent michael scarn sits with his feet up on his desk  catherine zetajones enters   sir you have some messages  not now   theyre important  okay what are they   the first

disgusting dwigt  wait whos dwigt   heres what we think happened  michaels sidekick who all through the movie is this complete idiot  whos causing the downfall of the united states was originally named dwight  but then michael changed it to samuel l chang using a search and replace  but that doesnt work on misspelled words  leaving behind one dwigt  and dwight figured it out  oops  dwight  okay you know what  i am done with this thats it the end  well some of us wanna keep reading so  you dont speak for everyone jim  okay announcement my uncle bought me some fireworks  and anyone who
