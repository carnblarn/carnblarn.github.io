210 season 2 christmas party  catch 22 team  el uploador keyshawn occeane unfold    did it work   well sort of  why did you get it so big   a thats what she said  and b  i wanted it to be impressive  he biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year  but what are we going to do with this hacked off part   well that is a perfectly good mini tree kevin  and we are going to sell that to charity  thats what christmas is all about  so this year for the first time ever  i got pam in secret santa  and i got her this teapot  which i know she really wants  so she can make tea at her desk  but im also gonna stuff it with some inside jokes  like  this is my high school yearbook photo  she saw it at the party and it really makes her laugh  im not sure why  what else  this is hot sauce packet  she put this on a hot dog a couple of years ago  because she thought it was ketchup  and it was really funny  so i kept the other two  this would take a little too long to explain  so i wont  and this is a card  because christmas is the time to tell people how you feel  is there anything were missing   phyllis you got the lights   yes i got those cute little ones  do you think i should have gotten the big ones   well see  angela drafted me into the party planning committee  her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster  which to me seemsexcessive  merry christmas   pimp   im kidding  what do we got  what do we got  how many plates are we getting   fifty  double it double everything  double ice cream double napkins double it  on me  it was a tough year  i had to fire somebody this year  this party has to really rock  check it out  christmas bonus threethousand gs  i got this for helping save the company money  so i guess some good came out of firing devin after all  maybe  i should call him tell him that  i want people to cut loose  i want peoplemaking out in closets  i want i want people hanging from the ceilings lampshades on the heads  i want it to be a playboy mansion party  and also i want you to know  and spread the word that i will have my digital camera  and i will be taking pictures all along the way  and the best and craziest thing that happens  will be on the cover of the newsletter  incentive  you do realize that we cant serve liquor at the party  yeah i know dammit  stupid corporate wet blankets  like booze ever killed anybody  one two three  you guys should use a hand truck  do we have one   no  will you help me   no no way  it no  come on mike let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours   you wanna be santa   yeah  have you ever seen santa   yeah ive seen santa who cares   okay well im sorry it just doesnt work  michael   i would like to be the elf  that makes sense because he has elfish features  okay everyone listen up   it is time to get your presents  wrap them and place them under the tree  like so  if you do not get your present wrapped  and under the tree within the next five minutes  you  will be disqualified from secret santa  all right  no exceptions  except michael  i got angela  shes into these posters of babies  dressed as adults i got her one of those  i felt kind of weird buying that  i got creed  and to tell you the truth i dont know anything about creed  know his names creed i know he works right over there  i think hes irish and i  i got him this uh shamrock keychain  i got myself for secret santa  i was suppose to tell somebody but i didnt  you get something good this year  i think i did a pretty good job  whod you have    i cant tell you cause its a secret  think i got something pretty nice for my guy   yeah   spent a lot of dough a lot of dough  wow  well there theres a 20 limit right  so  yeah i wanted this party to be really special  so i sorta went above and beyond  hats great well dont tell me who it is cause  it was ryan  yep  i  have ryan  gather round  secret santa lets go lets go come on  stanley no im gonna handle the cord  kay  safety reasons  i know how to plug something in  i wanna do it  all right   lets count it down like rockefeller center  ready   three  two  one  yeah   not great  sorry everybody  i think the tree looks nice   i could get some flares from my car   no no  shake it off everybody just lets do secret santa  presents are the best way to show someone how much you care  it is like this tangible thing that you can point to and say  hey man i love you this many dollars worth  first present oscar  a shower radio neat  oh great that was from me  hanks kelly you know i was gonna get one of these  okay thats enough lets keep it moving on jim  ah cool  thats from me  great  whered you get it   i dont know it was so long ago  he obviously forgot to get me something  and then he went into his closet and dug out this little number  and then threw it in a bag  yep thats exactly what happened  pam  oh my god   thank you very much santa whoever you are   its awesome  theres a little more to it  all right next ryan  dont   a video ipod  omebody really got carried away with the spirit of christmas  it was me i got carried away with the spirit  wasnt there a 20 limit on the gift  this is 400 bucks   you dont know that  yeah you left the price tag on  i did what  oh shoot wow  well who cares it doesnt matter what i spent  what matters is that christmas is fun right   michael  for me   what is in here    come on   ii knitted it for you  an oven mitt   okay  so phyllis is basically saying   hey michael i know you did a lot to help the office this year  but i only care about you a homemade oven mitts worth  i gave ryan an ipod  should we just keep opening up the presents   we dont do anything until michael gives us further instructions  i got it   we are going to turn secret santa into yankee swap   what is yankee swap   one person chooses a gift  the next person can either choose a gift  or steal that persons gift  if your gift gets stolen then you can steal someone elses gift  or choose a new gift  i thought that was called nasty christmas  yeah we call it white elephant  well i call it fun   why are we doing this   because its better because its more special   i sounds mean  shut  no its not okay just give it a shot  michael should have asked the party planning committee first  hes not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere  okay meredith is up first  heres the deal you can either pick a new gift  or you can steal somebody elses gift theyve already gotten  like the oven mitt  ill take the teapot  oh shouldnt we  i bought that specifically for pam  yaaankee swap thats what makes it fun   pam you can steal the oven mitt now  ill take the ipod  and i have to give it to her  i dont have a choice   yes now you can steal the oven mitt  the old shirt the shower radio or pick a new gift   that was meant for kelly  yeah i figured  i think this is going great   yikes   well its for angela so  thats like the creepiest thing that ive ever seen  angela youre up  ill take the poster  some  people like these  i will steal the ipod  everyone wants the ipod its a huge hit  it is almost a christmas miracle  ah well oscar you little gourmand  you have the next turn  ill take the teapot  dammit  okay moving along meredith lets go  i really want the ipod  its already been stolen this round pick something else  i hope nobody takes this baby cause this is great  wow look at that fine craftsmanship  somebody really put a lot of work into that its beautiful  ill take the oven mitt  see i wanted somebody to take it boom  reverse psychology  reverse psychology is an awesome tool  i dont know if you guys know about it  but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe  and that tricks them into doing something stupid  works like a charm  in addition to these paint ball pellets your gift includes  two paintball lessons with dwight schrute  you and me michael yes   who wants to take paintball lessons   how is that better than an ipod   i never said it was better than an ipod  michael keeps bragging about his ipod but you know what   two paintball lessons with someone as experienced  as i am is worth easily like two grand  take that saddam  last gift kevin  i want the footbath  thats the thing i bought myself  im really psyched to use it  maybe i should have taken the ipod  shoot  pam steal something or pick the final gift  i want the ipod   dammit  sure you dont want the teapot   i mean its an ipod   right  sorry  no no definitely  okay well i guess i will take that book of short stories  yes there you go i want the teapot  gracias  you gotta be kidding me   yankee swap is like machiavelli meets  christmas  what is she so upset about   maybe because you hated her present so much  i think yankee swap was a big hit  i think it was a success  and im the one who ended up with dwights stupid paint ball pellets  yeah but michael the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people  and  you should have just bought a 20 gift like everyone else  well i didnt i got a big bonus because i fired devin  and i used the money to buy something awesome sue me   you got a bonus check   how much   it wasntit wasnt that much it was 3000  all right im done now  unbelievable i do the nicest thing that anyones ever done for these people  and they freak out  well happy birthday jesus sorry your partys so lame  that comes to 16641  all right now youre the expert  is this enough to get  fifteen bottles of vodka  yeah that should do it  cool cool box it up  we wish you a merry christmas we wish you a merry christmas  we wish you a merry christmas and a happy new year  i bought this teapot for pam and i know she really wants it   so can i trade you for it   no trades  come on its a shamrock keychain good luck  a real man makes his own luck  billy zane titanic  look it has sentimental value dwight  can i buy it from you   no i want it im going to use it   you dont even drink tea  true  but i get sinus infections  and sinus infections can be cured by making a tea from green tea leaf stems  and pouring it directly into your nose like so  to think that my gift to pam will be used for that  its a little too much to handle   this is awesome  i know  its totally going to change the way i workout  yeah and i was going to get you one of these for christmas  now i dont have to im gonna save a ton of money  so what are you going to get me instead   i dont know probably like a sweater or something  looks like santa was a little naughty  what is that   this is christmas spirit as in spirits booze  we can drink   were really not supposed to serve alcohol  zip it toby just i mean its a party come on  if i cant throw a good party for my employees then i am a terrible boss   who wants a drink   me please  here we go
