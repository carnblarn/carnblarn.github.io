doors turn off the lights  pretend youre not here  are we in danger   theres no time to think about it this is real  just shh everybody  michael should i call the  what   the it tech guy and me did

you anything  look michael  i know you dont want to have to think about this  but if something were to happen to you  god forbid then i would need to know in order to take over  dwight nothing is going to happen to me okay   im in the best shape of my life  look at this  yeah but that doesnt matter you could get a brain aneurysm   im not going to get a br  or get hit by a car   stop  or a bus or a train  you could get poisoned fall down a well   step on a mine choke  okay  if i step on a mine in scranton pennsylvania  and die you can have my job okay   why dont you just go away   there are certain things a boss does not share with his employees  his salary  that would depress them  his bed  it  and i am not going to tell them that ill be reading their emails   so how do you search   by keyword phrase  try profits  no try michael scott  michael boss and funny  oh my god   email from stanley  stanley terribly nice guy  sorry i didnt write back sooner  i cant go to the game tonight because my boss michael is an ass  and making me stay late  well stanleys an ass  not one of our harder workers  hey whats the deal michael   why are you spying on our computers   oh no everybody oscars gone crazy  what other ghost stories have you got for us   that im a robot   i will destroy everything in my path  actually we just   okay   oil can oil can  tin man  actually we just got a memo from it  saying youre doing email surveillance  oh  what  no that defeats the whole purpose  so its true  you have access to our emails   you know what the problem is   i think i do  the problem is that when people hear the term big brother  they immediately think its scary or bad  but i dont i think wow i love my big brother  i gotta erase a lot of stuff  a lot of stuff  oh hey just so you know if you have any sensitive emails  they need to be deleted immediately   i know  good  hey  something just happened  dwight just told angela that she has to delete all of her sensitive emails   immediately    what   i know   do you theyre like  no  right no  maybe  its like squishing a spider under a book  its gonna be really gross  but i have to look and make sure that its really dead  so  if you guys see anything  hey dwight   my friend is kind of into these two girls that he works with  nice  one is tall and brunette  and the other is short and blond  and perky and kind of judgmental  who do you think he should choose   does he have access to their medical records   i think on of the greatest things about modern america  is the computerization of medical records  as a volunteer sheriff  i  can look up anyones psychiatric records or surgical histories  yeast infections  there are a huge number of yeast infections in this county  probably  because were down river from that old bread factory  meredith has an evite from jim  barbecue at jims tonight  tonight   wonder where my evitation is   click on guest list  angela stanley oscar  meredith phyllis kevin creed  must be  no  hey angela hows it going   its okay  listen are you bringing anyone  to jims party tonight   no are we supposed to   no i mean i dont know i dont think so  excuse me  theres always a distance between a boss and the employees  it is just natures rule  its intimidation mostly  its the awareness that they are not me  i do think that i am very  approachable as one of the guys  but  maybe i need to be even approachabler   thats pretty  yeah  are you going to eat with us   of course hanging with my crew  crew that i am one of  hanging with my cup of noodles  this is a meal in a cup right here  hot tasty reminds me of college  lived on this stuff brain food  you know what i really really miss about college   the parties  everybodyd go the athletes the nerds the professors  the professors would
