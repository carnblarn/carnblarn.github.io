to other men  okay little too far crossed the line  okay i am telling you oscar is an actual homosexual  yeah he told me this morning  and obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion  i wouldve never called him that if i knew  you dont you dont call retarded people retards  its bad taste you call your friends retards when theyre acting retarded  and i consider oscar a friend  listen man i am so sorry i had no idea   oh its fine  no   its okay its okay  no its not i just  i feel terrible about it i  i have been calling people faggy since i was in junior high  and i have never made this mistake  if i dont know how to behave  it is because i am just so far the opposite way  you know im just ii cant even imagine the thing  maybe we could go out for a beer sometime and you could tell me  how you do that to another dude  that sounds like a great wonderful idea lets do that  it explains so much  no im not gay  and i dont understand why anyone would think that im gay if  yeah im gay  i cant say whether dunder mifflin paper is less flammable sir but  i can assure you that it is certainly not more flammable  why did i transfer to stamford  i think thats pretty obvious  i got promoted

and whos not  of course  what about oscar   absolutely not  well he is  well hes not dressed in womens clothes so  there could be others i need to know  i dont want to offend anybody else  you could assume everyone is and not say anything offensive  yeah im sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay  hey what about angela shes hard and severe she could be a gay woman   i really dont think so  i dont know  i can imagine her with another woman cant you  do some research find out if theres a way to tell by just looking atem  jim told me you could by gaydar online  thats ridiculous  yeah probably he didnt tell the truth a lot   lets call him and get the website  definitely  whats gaydar  oh oh gaydar yes no uh i think they have it at sharper image  oh you know what i can check for you no problem  its sold out  yeah sorry about that thats a bummer   well theyre sold out  damn  try brookstone  i miss that  chicken or fish  chicken   so you uh having a good day  excellent thanks  good im glad  okay  yeah i didnt go through with the wedding  i got cold feet a few days before  and i cant really explain it i just had to get out of that relationship  we still had to pay for all the food  so we froze it but im im doing well  i have my own apartment and im taking art classes  and i have lunch for the next five weeks  after pam dumped me i um  i kind of stopped taking care of myself for a while there and uh  i hit bottom when uh i had a drunk driving arrest  ive  been working out and um you know  im not gonna take her for granted  i gotta win her back  i got them a toaster  they called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me  i tried to return the toaster to the store  and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster  so now my house has got two toasters  it is so cool that youre gay i totally underestimated you  yes i am super cool  i am an accountant at a failing paper supply company in scranton  much like uh sir ian mckellen  sure sometimes i watch will  grace  and i want to throw up  its terribly loud  i do like it sometimes when harry connick jr is on  hes so talented  okay who put my calculator is jello  good one  but uh seriously guys who did this  seriously guys who did this  i need to know who put my calculator in jello  or im gonna lose my freakinmind  you know itits amazing to me that in this day and age you could be so  obtuse aabout sexual orientation  i watch the l word   okay  good good  i watch queer as beep   thats not what its called  so  okay michael are you aware that you outed oscar today  what what does that even  coming out is a significant moment for a gay person  and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it  well gay pride right  gay pride parade its not like gay shame festival  all right now oscars feeling discriminated against by his coworkers  primarily angela and um thats your fault  i think angela might be gay  could oscar and angela be having a gay affair   no  maybe is that what this is about   no  i dont  no its not possible   anythings possible  okay you know imagine  you were gay  well im not gay jan and you should know that better than anybody  michael  your immaturity is extremely disappointing  and may even lead to a lawsuit  which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now   do you understand  i know  the company has made it my responsibility today  to put an end to 100000 years of being weirded out by gays  am i the first gay man you ever knew  trick question  because you cant always tell so how would i know  was that the right answer   yep  michael  dwights looking at gay pornography on his computer  uh michael knows pam  okay he asked me to do this just for him he has his own reasons  okay  nothing  wrong with this stuff at all this is fine  you know what gay porn straight porn  its all good i dont particularly get into this  but uh you know what  i totally see the merit and actually it is quite beautiful   oh damn popups  what are you doing   watching some of your friends  this is stupid   excuse me  dont touch me help ow  whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa stop it  all right everybody in the conference room  i dont care if you are gay or straight or a lesbian or overweight  just get in here right now  did you know that gay used to mean happy  when i was growing up it meant lame  and now it means a man who makes love to other men  were all homos homo sapiens  gays arent necessarily who you think they are people  i mean anybody can be gay  businessmen like antique dealers or hairdressers or accountants  oscar why dont you take this opportunity to officially come out  to everybody here  however you want to do it  go ahead stand up im doing this for you  yes im gay  and  i didnt plan on sharing that part of my life with you today so  whatever can i sit down now  i am not offended by homosexuality  in the60s i made love to many many women often outdoors  in the mud and the rain  and its possible a man slipped in there would be no way of knowing  who should be the judges and juries of our society  judges and juries  yes thats a good point she has a good point  because  gay marriage currently is not legal under us law  i bet a lot of straight men wished that applied to them  so they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex  as much as they could you know that sounds pretty good right  that sounds great  yeah dwight  i think all the other office gays should identify themselves  or i will do it for them   no one else in this office is gay  what about phyllis  she makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine  im getting married to bob vance   you are  congratulations   when did you get that  thats great  congratulations phyllis that is great  and frankly kind of amazing see everybody has a chance   thank you  but still phyllis  in college did you ever experiment with other women a lot of women do  no and you know me in high school  of course we all thought you were gay in high school  yeah right ha ha  and i take that as a compliment  well with your ties and your matching socks  well i just liked to look good okay so  you sound pretty defensive michael  no i am just coming out myself i am coming out hetero  i think the problem with this office is  that you are sending mixed signals about my being here  no no no the only signal that i am sending is  gay good look if i was gay  i would be the most flamboyant gay youve ever seen  i would be leading the parade covered in feathers and  just id be waving that rainbow flag  i dont think i can work here any longer  this has been the worst most backwards day of my life  you misunderstandokay all right bababababop you know what okay  okay i uh im gonna put my money where my mouth is you ready   what are you doing  i am going to embrace oscar  you might want to watch this angela because you cant catch anything  here we go   no  we are going to make a statement  you and i are going to make a statement together   oscar is my friend  id rather not   and i just dont care who sees it  i   doesnt bother me  i really would  wouldid really rather not  come here friend youre my friend  no no  i dont want to touch you  ever consider that youre ignorant  and insulting and small  okay  all right  im sorry michael michael im sorry  that was a good idea come on  come on all right   im sorry i called you faggy  i know i know   youre not faggy  i know you are   youre a good guy  you too  michael appears to be gay too  and yet he is my friend  i guess i do have a gay friend  you know what im gonna raise the stakes   you dont really dont  i want you to watch this  and i want you to burn this into your brains   i dont think we need to  because this is an image  that i want you people to remember  for a long time to come  whenever you come into the office i want you to think about this  we dont need to   yes we do  what  i did it   thank you  thank you  see im still here  were all still here  oh come one dwight come on man  were not in the playground anymore  there are new rules  we have to be mature   but we cant lose the spirit of childlike wonder  what is love anyway  maybe its suppose to break all the rules  like me and jan  or oscar and some guy  life is short  when two people find each other what should stand in their way  it is very easy for you to be a hero  all you need are honesty empathy respect and openmindedness  im glad today spurred social change  thats part of my job as regional manager  but you know what even if it didnt at least we put this matter to bed  thats what she said or he said  oh theres gil oscars roommate  i wonder if he knows  i was going to quit but jan offered me a three month paid vacation  and a company car  all i had to do was sign something saying i wont sue  gil and i are going to europe  kids sometimes it pays to be gay  hope this helps jim  nice   what are you doing  shh dont be scared  it works heh  oh no
