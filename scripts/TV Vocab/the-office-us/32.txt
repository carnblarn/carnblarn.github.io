calling jan  or does somebody miss me  michaeled died over the weekend  oh wow  attention everybody  i just received a call from corporate  with some news that they felt that i should know first  my old boss  ed truck has died  oh michael thats such terrible news  you must feel so sad  yes i am  its very sad  because he was my boss  oh thats a shame ed was a good guy  thats right you worked with him  so did creed  well ill be in my office  in case anybody wants to drop by  cheer me up  so did you hear the news  the news that you just announced  that ed died  yeah  is there anything i can do  oh gosh what can anybody do really  justpsh  he was almost 70 circle of life  yeah  oh okay  yeah  mmmmm  okay  whats going on with fairfield county schools  karen did you generate that price list  umshoot uh i will sorry  okay just get it done  jim will you make sure  oh yeah definitely  suck up  ahem  josh did you hear what i said  thank you everyone  damn it  whats up  oh nothing  theyre just out of herrs chips  oh  but dont worry about it  my snack food doesnt fall  under  the umbrella of your authority  mm thats where youre wrong  im your project supervisor today  and ive just decided  that were not doing anything  until you get the chips that you require  so i think we should go get some  now please  its a real shame about ed huh  yeah must really have you thinkin  about what  the older you get  the bigger the chance is youre gonna die  you knew that  ed was decapitated  what really  he was drunk as a skunk  he was flying down route 6  he slides under an 18wheeler  pop it snaps right off  oh my god  that is the way to go  instant death very smart  you  know a human can go on living for several hours  after being decapitated  youre thinking of a chicken  whatd i say  that is just not the way  a dunder mifflin manager should go  im sorry  alone out of the blue  not even have his own head to comfort him  so im not exactly  sure how to say this  ed was decapitated what are you doing  you said you didnt know how to say it   ihe  was driving  on the road  and he went under a truck  and thats when his  hhhead was  separated from  the rest of him  and i will let you know more  as soon as i find out  hey hi  if my head ever comes off  i would like you to put it on ice  i do not want to talk about this  when i die  i want to be frozen  and if they have to freeze me in pieces  so be it  i will wake up stronger than ever  because i will have used that time  to figure out exactly why i died  and what moves i could have used  to defend myself better  now that i know what hold he had me in  i dont understand  we have a day honoring martin luther king  but he didnt even work here  i understand how you feel michael  i really do  so would it be helpful to give everyone the day off  you really dont get it do you  you dont understand these people  that is the last thing that they would want  is a day off  well what would you suggest  a statue  of ed yeah  im not sure thats realistic  well i think it would be very realistic  it would look just like him  no thats not  we could have his eyes light up  you could have his arms move  that is not a statue that is a robot  i think that is a great way to honor ed  and how big do you want this robot  lifesize  mm no better make it 23  easier to stop if it turns on us  what the hell are you two talking about  well we are talking about how to properly honor  a man who gave his life  as regional manger of this company jan  you know what michael  ive really tried with you today  and i have to get back to work  oh do you  you know who wished they could get back to work  is ed truck  but ed truck cant because he is  goodbye dead  looki gave him a sixfoot extension cord  so he cant chase us  thats perfect  okay that is a no on the west side market  okay great i think thats enough  can iget back to work now  wow never pegged you for a quitter  i am not a quitter  i will do this all day if you want  really yeah all day  hey what are we doing  whats the game want in  oh theres no game  were just trying to get these chips for karen  did you check the vending machine  oh the vending machines how did we miss that  i have no idea  we went right for the copier  mmhmm and then we checked the fax machine  yeah nothing there  did you check your butt  ooh can you imagine how much blood there was  if it happened right here  it would reach all the way to reception  probably get on pam  okay thats enough what  we do not want to hear about this  well you know what  i didnt wanna hear about it either stanley  but i did and now i cant stop picturing it  he leaves work hes on his way home  wham his cappa is detated from his head  you have just spit on my face  well you know what  theres something wrong with you  there is something wrong with everybody in here  because we have lost  a member of our family  and you dont wanna talk about it  you dont wanna think about it  you just wanna get back to work  there are five stages to grief  which are denial  anger  bargaining depression and acceptance  and right now out there  they are all denying  the fact that theyre sad  andthats hard  and its making them all angry  and it is my job to try to get them  all the way through to acceptance  and if not acceptance then just depression  if i can get them depressed then ill have done my job  im going to throw you this ball  when you catch the ball i want you to say  the name of a person very important to you  somebody really special who died  d then i want you to say how they died  and you may cry if you like  that is encouraged  let me just start let me show you how this works  i catch the ball  i lost ed truck  andit feels like somebody took my heart  and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears  and at the same time  somebody else is hitting my soul  in the crotch  with a frozen sledgehammer  and then a third guy walks in  and starts punching me in the grief bone  and i am crying  and nobody can hear me  because i am terribly terribly  terribly alone  excuse me im sorry to interrupt  i need to see pam  there seems to be like something wrong  with the radiator in her car  okay  fine hurry back  theres nothing wrong with your car  i just thought you might want a break  from the grief counseling session  ohi would like a break  how are you liking the new car  great yeah  it sure is small  got air bags  i think so  i dont know i was mainly focused on the cup holders  well youre still not driving so fast are you  yeah  hi yeah this is mike from the west side market

your turn  you have to go i will not  okay  im going to  toss the ball  to pam  lets see  i had an aunt  that i was really close to  she was this amazing female boxer  um anyway she was injured in a fight  and she was paralyzed  so you can imagine how upset i was  when i found out  that she asked her manager  to remove her breathing tube  so she could die  wow  if you want to cry thats okay  thanks um  a few years ago  my family was on a safari in africa  and um my cousin mufasa  was um he was trampled to death  by a pack of wildebeests  and um we all took it really hard  all of us kind of in the audience  of what happened  do you wanna talk about it anymore  oh it would probably take me like  an hour and a half to tell that whole story  me me me me me  yes okay  umi was trying to throw this party once  and everyone was over for the weekend  and then my uncle bernie died  and so me and  my best friend  we had to pretend like he was alive  so  wait a second  thats weekend at bernies  do you think that this is a game  well there is a ball  all right were starting over  no im done  you are not leaving no we are not done  we really have a lot of work to do  yeah well you know what  the guy who had my job has died  and nobody cares  and he sat at my desk  michael  look i know this is hard for you  but deaths just a part of life  i mean just this morning i saw a little bird  fly into the glass doors downstairs and die  and i had to keep going  how do you know what  that that bird was dead  did you check its breathing  it was obvious  was its heart beating toby  did you check it no of course you didnt  youre not a veterinarian  you  dont know anything  michael  michael  michael  michael  oh god  ohh oh my god  oh my god come on  poor little fella  oh shoot hes a goner  no hes not yeah  no hes not  michael get him away from your head  he is covered in germs and bacteria  you cant get diseases from a bird  that bird should not be in the kitchen  we dont know if its dead  uh no that thing is dead  you want me to flush him  attention everybody  this will only take a second  of your time  today at 400 pm  we will be meeting in the parking lot  to have a funeral service for this bird  i have a lot of work to do  wellim sorry to inconvenience you  meredith  but that is what you do when things die  you honor them  toby killed this bird  and now we are going to honor it  but no no no  thats enough you know what  this bird is dead  it died alone  the least you can do  is be there for him now  find a box for him  im calling a supermarket in montreal  nice  bonjour je cherche  de chips de la marque herrs  non  oh merci comme mme  au revoir  nope  sounded good thanks  its okay  its okay  shh yes i know  i know its been a tough day  but its good to let it show  i mean how many times do i have to confirm plans  with ryan for him to know that we have a date tonight  god  what are  what are you doing  what  no this is about the right size  no god no its not  what is the matter with you  is that the beak  im sorry i grew up on a farm  we slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon  my grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum  it wouldve fit if he had given me another minute  i need a box  i need a box a small box  not too confining  is it for the bird yeah  i have it covered  oh thank you  if you want to do something for the funeral  yes please  maybe you could play a song on your recorder excellent  do you have it with you always  did i wake up this morning thinking id be  throwing together a bird funeral  you never can tell what your day here  is gonna turn into  whered you find them  whered i find what  i called the manufacturer  who referred me to the distributor  who referred me to the vending machine company  who told me that they sell them in the machines  in the building next door  glad you could all make it  you told us we had to  dwight do you have the box  actually i have it  you made this  wow  thats thats very nice  when ias five my mom told me  that my fish went to the hospital  in the toilet  and it never came back  so we had a funeral for it  and i remember thinking  im a little too old for this  and i was five  id also like to say a few words  if thats okay  yes  what do we know about this bird  you might think not much its just a bird  but we do know some things  we know it was a local bird  maybe its that same bird that surprised oscar  that one morning with a special present from above  oh i remember that that was so funny  and we know how he died  flying into the glass doors  but you know what  i dont think he was being stupid  i think he just  really really wanted to come inside our building  to spread his cheer  and lift our spirits with a song  its not a songbird shh  an impression then  lastly we cant help but notice  that he was by himself when he died  but of course we all know  that doesnt mean he was alone  because im sure  that there were lots of other birds  out there who cared for him  very much  he will not be forgotten amen   just smile for me and let the day begin    you are the sunshine    that lights my heart within   society teaches us  that having feelings and crying  is bad and wrong  well thats baloney  because grief isnt wrong  there is such a thing as good grief  just ask charlie brown  les get back to work  guys get a broom  lets clean this up  grab a broom  you heard me mush
