down dwight  i have to chip away at his ally  in this case its michael  heres the good news  every success ive ever had  at my job or with the ladyfolk  has come from my ability  to slowly and painfully  wear someone down  whats the deal with dwight  doing your laundry  thats a long story  couple months ago  dwight tried to  go my behind back with jan  and get my job  and now i am having him  do my laundry as a punishment  wow that is a long story  but quite well told michael  i find it very interesting  especially the part about  dwight going behind your back  and basically being  like a terrible person  you know if you want  you laundry done right  i used to work at abercrombie  so pretty good folder  why are we turning in here  this is beauty salon  hey do you mind  if i take the lead on this one  and then you can critic me after  you want the lead  yeah if you dont mind  mind  nothing would delight me more  hey pam  would you like to go with me and grab a coffee  really

scranton  its really a pleasure  to be the part of it  its like everyone has  their own special skills  you know  just like the super friends  except for dwight  he is kind more of a super dud  i mean  hed be a super friend  if there was a super friends  who has super power  was always being late  you know  hawkman  my plan is talking  longer than i thought  but i dont give up easily  i have walked  two marathons so  lets go  the mens room was disgusting  thank you sir  no thank you  ive never let  anyone walk behind me  from the rear  okay but that still leaves  a 30 percent chance  that ill attack you  from the front  uh yeah  but it will be easier to stop  i can always block the blow  or i can counter it with  hey did you catch that  upon lake wallenpaupack  yeah  you know i used to go up there  all the time with my step dad  and i never caught  anything like that big  i caught an 80pound  shark off montauk  its in hamtons  my dads got a 42foot bayliner  sniped it with a rifle  from the crows nest  i also shot a dear once  you know what  lets get it right down to it  dundermifflin  may be just two rooms  and a warehouse  but what we lack in flash  we will make up for  with hard work and decency  okay this is the classic undersell  because you should know  we dont work out of a log cabin  we trade on the  new york stock exchange  ever heard of it  its in new york  um i have to say  im little aware of  get involve with  a big company  weve had  some problems in the past  and i think  what andy is trying to express  is that while we have  the resources of a large company  we will give you the care  and attention of small company   that is like poetry  no   i swear this guy could sell paper to a tree  stop it stop it  oh man talk about  your classic lamedasho  do we even want that guy  buying our paper  yes  angela you seem so happy  i bet you wish you were like this  all the time  this friend of mine  lets call her noelle  she missed this deadline  turning something in to  corporate in new york  but then this gallant gentleman  well call him kurt  he drove all the way  to new york  and handed it in for her  because i dont know  i guess he just really likes her a lot  well thats great  yes it is  hello  im im so sorry man  i really screwed that up   really   no dont worry about it  i really schruted it  what  schruted it  this is the thing that people say  in your office all the time  like when you screw something up  in a really irreversible way  you schruted it  i dont know where the word  comes from though  i think it comes from  dwight

this morning  he didnt say  thats weird  because i was just passing the desk  and i saw this  which is a toolbooth receipt  from new york city  stamped early this morning  why would dwight go new york  without telling anyone  you think he went to see jan  thats not like him  isnt  someone told me  a story about this  with like laundry and betrayal  did you betray dwight  and try to steal  his job or something  no  you are remembering it wrong  dwight betrayed me once before  so this is his strike two  you know what they say  fool me once  strike one  but fool me twice  strike three  i like karen  shes pretty  appears intelligent  well i like pretty women  who have the appearance  of intelligence  my girlfriend is also  beautiful and smart  she could be a model  or a college professor  which is intimidating  to a lot of guys  we should go on a double date  no thank you  dwights name is  on the security sigh sheet  but i dont know  who he met with  and where it asks you to  state your business  he wrote beeswax not yours inc  i know it  ooooh doggy  hey you wanna grab a coffee  sure  look at you  hey we made the sale  where were you this morning  i overslept  damn rooster didnt crow  why do you lie liar  im not a liar  you are lying right now  sure seems like hes lying  stay out of this you  i know that you went to  corporate this morning  and i know  that you lied about it  and given our history  i need you to tell me  right now  exactly what you were doing  this morning  michael i cannot tell you  what i was doing there  but you have to trust me  i would never do anything  to hurt you or this company  okay you know what  i want you to think about  your future at this company  i want you to think about it  long and hard  thats what she said  dont you dare  i want to know  what you were doing this morning  by the end of the day  its gonna be okay  how is it going to be okay dwight  everyone will know  our business  thats not the worst  thing in the world  ill just stand up  in front of the office  and reveal our true love  it wont be that bad  look at kelly and ryan  i hate those two people  more than anything  in the entire world  well i dont have a lot of choices  so let me ask you a question  okay  did you ever have  a thing for pam  pam  did i ever have  a thing for her  no  why did she say something  i moved here  from connecticut  yeah  okay heres the  i had a crush on her  before i left  and i told her about it  and she didnt feel  the same way  so it didnt amount to anything  and i left  im really glad youre here  okay  okay  may i have your attention please  it will only take  a moment of your time  although ive loved this company  more than almost anything  in the world  i decided to step down from my post  and spend more time with my family  i do not fear the unknown  i will meet my new challenges head on  and i will succeed  and i will laugh in the faces  of those who doubt me  its been a pleasure  working with some of you  and i will not forget  those of you soon  but remember  while today it is me  we all shall fall  in other words im quitting  oompa loompa doompadee dossum  dwight is now gone  which is totally awesome  why was he gone  he was such a nice guy  no he was not  he was a total douche  doompadee doom  i would like to give  the rest of my belongings   to michael scott  just a second  except this   good luck    and this  dwight will be missed  not by me  so much  but he will be missed  dwight  from sales  was one of the most honorable  and efficient employees  this company has ever had  one of my life goals  was to die right here  in my desk chair  and today  that dream was shattered  what happened on your sales call  am i happy about  the way things turned out  well happys such an ugly word  but um  i saw it needed to be done  and i did it  and now im thrilled  so its pretty  hello  pretty good
