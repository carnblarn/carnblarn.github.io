think you were sick   thats exactly what i was thinking  question may i investigate   yeah drop what youre doing  make this a priority  because an office cant function efficiently  unless people are at their desks doing their jobs   i bought my veil  oh my god that is so exciting  can i be a bridesmaid   listen you dont have to answer now  but how are you going to do your hair   okay i was thinking about wearing it down  kind of like i dont know like  loose with big curls  you look like an angel im seriously going to cry  wowee  mikey likey  why dont you wear your hair down like that all the time   its much sexier  man this must be torture for you  yeah on the booze cruise i  told michael about some feelings i used to have for pam  i had just broken up with katy and  had a couple of drinks and  i confided in the worlds worst confidant  okay   hey mike  hey jim bag  remember that thing i told you on the booze cruise about pam   that was personal  so if we could just keep that between you and me  that would be great  really    who else knows   nobody  jim and i are great friends  we hang out a ton  mostly at work  but the fact that he told me his secret and no one else  says everything about our friendship  and it is why i intend on keeping that secret  for as long as i possibly can  my lips are sealed my lips are sealed bangles  all right great thank you  can you hear me they talk about us  telling lies  listen temp  i am conducting a little investigation  so i am no longer gonna be able to head up spring cleaning  do you think you can handle it    yeah i

you buddy  i called six minutes ago and no one answered  so i as wondering if you could explain  oh i see so  sounds like youre too sick to come into work  but youre well enough to go to the pharmacy  there are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying  the liar will avoid direct eye contact  the liar will cover part of his or her face with his hand  especially the mouth  the liar will perspire  unfortunately i spoke to oscar on the phone  so none of this is useful  its grrrrrape soda  tony the tiger you dont hear that much anymore   not so much  okay what is going on here    nothing  oh really nothing   fact you are drinking grape soda you never drink grape soda  fact you are talking to jim you never talk to jim  fact i love grape soda i always have  fact jim and i talk all the time  we tell each other secrets  okay so what is the secret michael    well i  i had asked michael  if i could head up the oscar investigation  and he said that only dwight  was capable of handling such sensitive material  is that true   i dont know uh yeah yeah it is  thank you michael   i know youre telling the truth  okay  i can tell   i wont let you down  good  thanks  nice that was

cigarette through a freakin quarter  and you know what toby  they almost bought from us   im not processing this  look jim needed a relaxing lunch  he has been depressed  and it has been affecting his productivity  how is that not workrelated   he seems fine to me  youre not his friend you dont know  he is in love with a girl he works with whos engaged  so just cut me some slack please  pam   oh
