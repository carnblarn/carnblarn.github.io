                oh  shes absolutely   he  oh sorry  hes dressing color pink  thats paper colour  well look at that   cute  thank you  oh may i   i am sure  hey look at me  i am a baby  hey mama  im thirsty  im thirsty mama  i want some milk  and you know where milk comes from   vous prsente  episode 9 saison 3 the convict     hey  hey  you almost done  just about yeah  now  yes ive started to see karen  its very new  and im not really ready to talk about it openly yet just because  i think once the word gets out there  it might affect the way people behave around us  ori dont know  just not yet  ah jan it um  looks like a check  a piece of paper of some sort  a receipt  jan this is angela martin from accounting  mmhmm  look we have a rebate  from the federal work opportunity program  and no one knows what that means  we get that money for hiring an exconvict  i didntire an exconvict  unless they mean toby  convicted rapist  im just kidding  when did the check come  last week  okay thats when the branches merged  so josh mustve been taking advantage of this program  smart move  one of the stamford people is a criminal  hey jan speaking of stamford  hannah brought in a baby  jan which one of new employees is a criminal  a reformed convict and im not sure  dont hang on let me email our h r  stay on the line  who is it  hannah  hmm  andy  andy  martin  oh you are such a racist   wait why am i a racist  because you think hes black  he is black right  stop it stop it right now  okay s someone named martin nash  yeah  michael  why did the convict have to be a black guy  it is such a stereotype  i just wish that josh had made a more progressive choice  like a white guy  who went to prison  for polluting a black guys lake  i wonder what he did  in our society  a black man can be arrested  for almost anything  he was probably at a sporting event  and saw some people pushing each other  and he intervened  why would anyone go to jail for that  so  what we need to do  is to forget  about this whole martin in prison thing  people will draw  unfair conclusions about martin  andor black people   cool  okay  angela   sure  lets protect the convicts  at the expense of the general feeling  of safety in the workplace  as a 90pound female that sits in an illlit  rarelyvisited corner of the office  naturally i agree with that  good  all right    jim halpert  i am so horny  okay i cant help you with that  oh  i think you can big tuna  tell me about that indian chick kelly  she seems pretty slutty  good for a romp in the sack  she is dating ryan i think  oh and i care why

 i am greatly concerned  about having a convict in the office  and i do not care if that convict is white  black asian german  or some kind of halfsie  i do not like criminals  oh god  all righty lets get started  what is she into  i know pam pretty well  i know the things that she likes  and just as important  i know the things that she hates  so one of the things that she likes is pranks  and the things that she hates  frisbeebased competitions  are you kidding  i started the main frisbee golf club at cornell  where i went to college  i live to frolf  lead off with that  okay  she loves hunting  she also loves those ads for six flags  with the old guy  got it  alsodo you speak pig latin  hey martin  hows it going  good  getting settled you know  ah good good good  just a second  everybody may i have your attention please  i realize that a lot of you have already heard  that martin here  has had some trouble with the law  but i just want to declare publicly  that i trust him completely  and that anybody who doesnt  is an ignorant dumb person okay  as a matter of fact  you show me a white man you trust  and i will show you a black man  that i trust even more  pam tell me a white person you trust  my dad  danny glover   yeah  jonas salk   who  justin timberlake  oh please colin powell  hey i got one  yeah jesus  apollo creed  close your eyes  picture a convict  whats he wearing  nothing special  baseball  cap on backward baggy pants  he says something ordinary like  yo thats shizzle  okay now slowly open your eyes again  who were you picturing  a black man  wrong  that was a white woman  surprised  well shame on you  so you all want to know what i was in for  no thats not cool  you dont have to tell them  i really dont mind  it was a stupid mistake  i was working in finance  and i got involved in some insider trading  so i spent a little time in the clink  oh  that is awesome  i had martin explain to me three times  what he got arrested for because  it sounds an awful lot  like  i what i do here every day  what was prison like  not terrible  boring  we do the same thing every day  but at least wed get outdoors time  you got outdoors time  two hours every day  sometimes wed play pickup football games  michael why dont we get outdoors time  yeah some days i never go outside  well we are running a business  what was your like  not good  it was a

prison  dont encourage him dwight  the worst thing about prison was was the dementors  they were flying all over the place  and they were scary  and then theyd come down and theyd suck the soul  out of your body and it hurt  dementors like in harry potter  no not harry potter  there were no movies in prison  this is my point  you guys got it soft and cushy  this place is freaking awesome  the people are awesome  your boss is nice  everybody seems to get along  people are tolerant  people who would jump to conclusions  can redeem themselves  nobodys nobodys bitch  i hope that this scared you  and from me prison mike to you  i just want to thank you for listening to me  and letting me be a part of your life today  cause you got a good life  you got a good life  a good life  so what do you think  it doesnt sound so great does it  wow  thank you  um that must have been hard for you to relive that  both of you  yeah that wasnt really  at all my experience  there were certain elements  of what you performed  ive seen on television  but it didnt remind me of my time in prison  okay okay fine  you guys think prison is so great  all right  well here you go  okay michael come on let us out  no if you think prison is so wonderful  then enjoy prison   are we locked in here  they are such babies  i am going to leave them in there  until they can appreciate what its like  to have freedom  and if this doesnt bother them  then i am out of ideas  hey let us out of here  hey i have shh  this is toby  hey pam  where are you calling from  michael why is everyone locked in the conference room  they were very disreectful to me and to the office  and martin has had a bad influence  to think that i gave him the benefit of a doubt  its  well youre gonna have to let them out or i will  okay you know what toby  i am teaching them a lesson so  you know theyre teasing you  i mean obviously this is  a much nicer place than an actual prison  we get paid to be here  we go home afterward and have social lives  and we have parties here  theyre teasing you  to be funny  okay nutcases get out of there  good work  long day really long  why dont you guys head home early  time off for good behavior  good job  enjoy your freedoms  martin went from being a new guy from stamford  to a convict  to my friend  back to a convict  then to kind of a nuisance actually  if we can be completely honest  and finally to a quitter  and i will not miss him  and that is not because he is black
