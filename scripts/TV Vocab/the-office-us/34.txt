                there you go  nice dress ryan  its not a dress its a kurta  okay  tonightone of our most ethnic coworkers kelly  has invited us all to a diwali celebration  put on by her community  what is diwali you may ask  well to have kelly explain it  its  its so super fun  and its gonna be great  a lot of gods with unpronounceable names  that its essentially a hindu halloween   you look so handsome  you really do   i love the material  i know  how come you didnt get me one  i  episode 6 diwali    okay so between merediths minivan  and if i borrow bobs yukon  that should fit about 12 people  i actually might not go   im feeling kind of tired  do you wan make appletinis  and watch sex and the city at my place  oh i dont know i havent decided yet  i dont get why you wont go  did i do something wrong  i mean i thought we were really close friends   i just feel kind of tiredyou know  maybe youve got mono  maybe  i just  i dont really have anyone to go with  well go with dwight  hes single too right  yeah totally single   are you guys going to this indian thing tonight  i dont know whos uh whos going  ohhyou mean like is pam going  dont go they eat monkey brains  hey hey hey stop that  that is offensive  indians do not eat monkey brains  and if they do  sign me up  because i am sure that they are very tasty  and nutritional  its important that this company celebrates its diversity  and you know what stanley  comewanzaa time i have got you covered baby  i dont celebrate kwanzaa  really  you should its fun  i love the people here  and if there was one thing i dont really care for  is that they can be terribly terribly ignorant  about other cultures  and i dont want them embarrassing me  in front of my girlfriend carol  diwali is a very important holiday for the hindus  but frankly im a little appalled  that none of you know very much about indian culture  so with out further adieu kelly  you are on  um diwali is awesome  and theres food  and theres gonna be dancing  and oh i got the raddest outfit   it has sparkles  kelly  um why dot you tell us a little bit about  the origins of the holiday  oh um i dont know its really old i think  how many gods do you have  like hundreds i think maybe more than that  and that blue busty gal whats her story  she looks like pam from the neck down  pam wishes  kelly ill take this one  diwali is a celebration of the coronation god king rama  after his epic battle with ravena  the demon king of lanka  it symbolizes the battle between good and evil  all right all right this isnt lord of the rings  oops sorry  i

work  nice basket  thank you  now a lot of people say that kelly is one in a million  and thats true but its also not true  because frankly there are literally billions of people  just like kelly in
