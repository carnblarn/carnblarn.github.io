somebody go today  this is uh the hardest thing ive ever had to do  why did you put it off until halloween   because its very scary stuff  i think its gonna put a damper on the party a little  youre worried about the party  theres a mans life at stake here   so its a man   no  or a woman a human life  if you had to guess ho it would be based on  their job performance   and who do you think deserved to be fired who would that be  i just answer the phone  and sometimes you just let it go to voicemail  your costume is fantastic  i know i sent away for it in july from a catalog  oh no dont dont dont dont  aah    okay  oh man  okay i have to fire somebody  what is that  what are you supposed to be   im a three hole punch version of jim  cause you can have me either way plain white jim or threehole punch   thats great  oh yeah  yeah well look what about me   what are you  a monk   i am sith lord  big deal  three round pieces of paper taped to his shirt  this cost me 129  ass  hey you guys excited about the party    its going to be fun  yeah  oh looks at you  showing your colors bet you wish you wore a dress every day   what are you implying   all good  happy halloween  what  happened to all those spooky decorations that we had    the cobwebs and such  you know i dont know  we put them all up last night  well you know what  go buy some more  ill approve the overages   sound good   yeah  good  oh yeah also about budget stuff  i going to need you to find like  a full employee salary plus benefits like fifty grand  im going to need you to find   but we dont keep two sets of books  well thats not what im saying  just you know find it pretend that your jobs depend on it  interesting take on dorothy  i love it hey you know what would even be better   soccer ball and cleats  why is that   bend it like beckham  oh like the movie about the indian girl who plays soccer  yeah  that would be perfect  yeah i mean i guess i could do that  i dont really play soccer or anything  well i dont really have two heads so  wait what are you again  oh right  three hole punch    okay greatest strength  okay okay   a dog like obedience to authority  nice   but that doesnt sound good  okay okay  how bout the ultimate team player   dwight is special  but i dont believe his talents are being used in this office  so pam and i have put his resume on monstercom google craigs list  were really interested most in jobs that take dwight out of state  preferably alaska or india  hes a gun nut  he sticks to his guns  well  i looked through all the budgets   and there is one department  yes   that has three people yeah   doing the work that could be done by two  this is great  oh  yeah  oh   who do you think it should be  jim   definitely  no jim brings in money  phyllis  stanley pam oscar meredith  kevin angela  its not a popularity contest  although it does make sense to fire the least popular  because it has the least effect on morale  one of the warehouse guys   what   there was someone left off that list  who is he saying  youre right i didnt even think of him  no michael   yeah thats actually a really good idea  no not me   yeah i could   not dwight   im not saying thats what he said  i know thats what he said  what   tell  him not dwight  that is not a very nice thing to say about him   tell him to stop  are you kidding   quiet you  i agree hed land on his feet  make him be quiet  those arent chips and dip  no i made brownies  what   im just trying to figure out why youre sabotaging things   i made brownies  and i made cookies  same category  im guessing angelas the one  in the neighborhood who gives  the trickortreaters some toothbrushes  pennies  walnuts  dunder mifflin this is pam  yeah  just one second i will uh transfer you to our manager michael scott  michael scott here  yes i am regional manager of this orifice  dwight schrute is amazing  yeah no he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation  you know what  im gonna tell you what  you hire dwight k schrute  and he does not meet nay exceed  every one of your wildest expectations  well then you can hold me  michael gary scott personally and financially responsible  okay okay okaykaykaykaykay okay   stanley could you come with me please  no  as assistant regional manager   to the   look  ive got some bad news youre fired  you need to pack up your things and go  im serious stanley  its over im sorry  youre fired get your fingers off my phone  so how did it go with stanley howhowd he take it   he wouldnt listen to me  oh come on  if you want to fire him youre going to have to tell him yourself  i dont wanna fire stanley i never said that  im certainly not going to do it myself  get those big baleful eyes staring at me yikes  just okay just  cumberland mills  how did you get my resume  oh no no im very flattered dont get me wrong  im just not sure that its my official resume  or if its something that maybe  a satisfied customer posted online  what does it say under martial arts training   oh okay im gonna have to supplement that  could i have your fax number  would i ever leave this company   look im all about loyalty  in fact i feel like part of what im getting paid for here is my loyalty  but if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly  im going wherever they value loyalty the most  oh hey  oh your dress is stuck in the back kind of just  oh  so you got the fax so why didnt you add it to the resume  what do you mean  of course martial arts training is relevant  oh excuse me i know about a billion asians that would beg to differ  get a little frustrated when im dealing with incompetence  well you know what  you can go to hell too  and i will see you thereburning  fine okay wait so youll let me know when youve made a decision  jim is really talented  and he should be the one whos getting a better job offer  like for real  dont take this the wrong way  but you should go for that job  its in maryland  yeah but i mean look at the salary  and its definitely a step up  and a challenge  yeah  yeah you know what  maybe  maybe i will  jim  this is called leveraging an offer   michael can i talk to you for a moment  oh god  i just thought you should know  that i was just offered a job with better pay  better benefits and a better title at cumberland mills   fantastic  and i turned it down  what  that wouldve solvedall my problems   out of loyalty to this company  oh you idiot   so i was hoping to be made assistant regional manager officially  if you left  i wouldnt have to fire anybody   but then you wouldnt have me here  big deal oh   it wouldve worked out so well can you get it back    its in maryland  you can call can you call em  i cant i i suppose i could no  they never really made me an offer anyway  why are you torturing me   g od  honestly i dont think that michael has  the slightest clue of who hes going to fire  i think he keeps hoping that someones going to volunteer  or be run over by a bus before the deadline  but in the end really whats going to happen is  its gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall  and therein lies the true essence of his charisma  yes  michael i really didnt mean to help me   im sorry   i want you to role play firing me  i want you to fire me and i will take it   oh you want me to be you  yes   okay  i want you to be me and i will be creed   oh are you firing creed  no no no thats just the first  thingcant in head  we should switch seats in order to   yes thats a good idea  alright  excuse me  im really sorry but i have to let you go  and its purely budgetary its not personal   wow  im going to kill myself   and its your fault   thats an overreaction  corporate is really breathing down my neck  and theyre saying this has to be done   by the end of the month  is this you  is this you are you being you or is this creed are you  i   this is creed  okay  im improvising so just try to keep up   hold that thought hold that thought  and im very angry and i want   michael scott here toby   im gonna kill you for firing me  i really have to take this creed so it was really worth   get off get off no no  okay  just just yeah   what happened   it wasnt me   oh that was like crazy cause i was  yeah i know   creed   huh   could i talk to you for a second   you are great very ambitious  and i feel like you want more than this little office has to offer  and i understand that youd wanna just spread your wings   and fly the coop  what are you telling me   i were gonna have to you you want something better  no i dont i wanna stay right here   no you wanna leave  no i wanna stay here  why why are you making this so hard    i think theres a misunderstanding michael   i think youre right
