friends is the master bedroom  check out the cathedrals ceilings those are like 17 feet high  we have cable readiness right there  i am going to totally pimp this place out  i am going to put a surround sound system  i am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall  owww terrible idea   im pulling my bed right over here  no  this is a shared wall  neighbor threw his wife into the wall  plasma screen hits the floor totally smashed   well then i will get a warranty  warranties dont cover it  plus theyre a rip off   well i wont get a warranty  hush   theres the problem its solved  listen listen can you hear that  oh man these babies are thin  games of the 1st dunder mifflin olympiad  this scented candle  which i found in the mens bathroom  represents the eternal  burning of competition   or something  it smells like cookies  yes it does yes it does my friend  ok we will be competing for gold silver and bronze yogurt lids  now the bronze are really blue  and theyre also the backside of the gold so no flipping ok honor system  i do play games i sing  and i dangle things in front of my cats  i play lots of games just not at work  let the games begin  and then i just need you to sign here at this ara   what kind of mortgage did you get  10 year   well 10 over 30 so 30 year total  what wha you said 10    ow 30 years  ok ok  wow youll be paying this off in your midseventies  forget about retiring when youre 65  hey i have an idea  you know that extra bedroom if the all girlfriend thing never happens   thats where the nurse can live  ok all right   well this is it  whenever youre ready  yeah huh okay   is that supposed to come off  actually yeah  hey look cool carpenter ends  im gonna take a little breather for a second excuse me   well be here waiting for you  oh man  a 30 year mortgage at michaels age  essentially means that hes buying a coffin  if i were buying my coffin  i would get one with thicker walls so you couldnt hear other dead people  whenever youre ready michael  you have what is the national sport of icelandic paper companies  and im blanking on the name could you help me out pam  jim they refer to it as flonkerton  in english box of papers snowshoe racing  fair enough but i like flonkerton  the thing about jim is  when hes excited about something like the office olympics  he gets really into it and he does a really great job  but the problem with jim is that he works here so that hardly ever happens  so who will be challenging kevin in flankerton   anyone  ill do it  yes phyllis  phyllis you just put your foot right trough here right trough the flank  the ceilings are lower than they were last week that i dont  i dont know if you showed me the same unit or not  what   michael this is the unit you saw and  where are all the hot people  i was told that there would be all these attractive singles   who told you that  and as far as i can i tell  im the best looking person here  theres a basic principle in real estate  that you should never be the best looking person in the development  its sort of a common sense because if you are  then youll get no place to go but down  is this a financial thing if its a financial thing what some people do is they rent out the third bedroom   no no  thats an extra income for you  i am not going to rent the third bedroom  i want a price reduction or i am walking  you

insist  because youve really done some great work great work  and that is why i am going to let you move in to my third bedroom  and pay me rent  why did i do it because i believe in rewarding people for their efforts  i rewarded dwight with the room  and he is rewarding me back with 500  plus utilities  i dont even know what to say  im thinking lock into a 4 year commitment  well go month to month after that  or until i start dating have a girlfriend and then youre  you know youre gone so  question where can i put my terrarium  what the hell is a terrarium  its a fish tank for snakes and
