                 michael  oh god dwight come on  i wanted to talk to you about the downsizing  theres no downsizing  but if there were id be protected as assistant regional manager   assistant to the regional manager dwight  yeah so i dont have to worry  look look look i talked to corporate  about protecting the sales staff and they said they couldnt guarantee it  if theres downsizing ok but theres no downsizing  bottom line do i need to be worried  maybe  it looks like theres gonna be downsizing  that is part of my job but  i hate it  i think the main difference between me and donald trump  is that i get no pleasure out of saying the words youre fired  youre fired youre fired  he just makes people sad  and an office cant function that way  no way youre fired  i think that if i had a catch phrase it would be  youre hired and you can work here as long as you want  but thats unrealistic so  its a real shame  cause studies have shown that more information get passed through  water cooler gossips than through official memos  which puts me in a disadvantage because  i bring my own water to work   why did you do this  i didnt do it  what do you mean  the water cooler was brought over here for  maintenance  so why are you guys here  whats the schedule bud  gets that for operation moral improvement  starring michael scott  now i think i had a little stroke of genius  in that i have had my assistant pam  smile pam i have had her go out and find out whose birthday  is coming up so we can have a little celebration for it  not bad not bad at all all right  and the birthday person is drum roll please  who is it whose the birthday  actually we dont have any staff birthdays coming up   next person on the calendar  ok   that would be meredith  yes all right   come on down meredith  but its not until next month  ok  great you know it will be a surprise   you still want to have a party  yeah why not sure  go ahead lead a little come on pam  come on shake it up shake it in  shake it up  spok is there any signs of life down there  well let me check captain  no captain no signs of life down there  just a wet blanket named pam  star trek  well for decorations maybe we could   stupid forget it  what  i was just gonna say maybe we could have streamers but  thats dumb everybody have streamers   never mind  no yeah i think thats a good idea  what color do you guys think  well theres green  blue  yellow   red  how about green  i think green is kind of whorish  this was tough  i suggested we flip a coin  but angela said she doesnt like to gamble  of course by saying that she was gambling that i wouldnt smack her  these are my party planning biatches  pulled off an amazing eighties party last year  off the hook  so i was thinking if you havent already got the cake  maybe going for one of those ice cream cakes from baskin robbins  theyre very good very delicious  meredith is allergic to dairy so  shes not the only one thats gonna be eating right  i think everybody likes ice cream cake  its not not just about her so   its her birthday  milk chocolate chip  would be good  hey so listen i was thinking that it might be a good idea  if you and i formed an alliance  because of the downsizing  i think an alliance might be a good idea  you know help each other out  do you want to form an alliance  with me   absolutely i do  good good  excellent ok now we need to figure out whos vulnerable  whos protected the  at that moment i was just so happy  i mean everything dwight does annoys me  did you get your tickets  to what  the gun show  and i spend  hours thinking of ways to get back at him  but only ways that would get me arrested  then here he comes and he says no jim heres a way  just one other thing and this is important  lets keep this alliance totally a secret  yeah  dont tell anyone   an alliance  oh yeah  what does that even mean  i think it has something to do with survivor but im not sure  i know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort pam  jim hey hi pam  can i talk to you a second about the paper products   did you tell pam about the alliance  no   just now  oh no no no  dwight no im using her  for the alliance who knows the most information about this office   pam right  thats good good pursue this  im trying to do you see what im doing  but listen im gonna have to talk to her a lot  all right there might chatting and giggling  and you got to just pretend to ignore it wipe it away  done all right  can you get her shes right there that is meredith  the birthday girl  and this  is meredith card happy birdday  lets see jim  jim wrote meredith i heard youre turning fortysix but come on  youre an accountant just fudge the numbers  not bad pretty funny  i dont appreciate condoning corporate

something that michael was telling me earlier  i just dont know what some of the people in like accounting are gonna do  its not specifically that  hey jim good party eh  just a little some wiped up you know a little moral boost no big deal  speaking of which i meant to tell you very impressive  the donation you gave to oscars charity   was that twentyfive bucks  well no yeah you know  money isnt everything jim not the key to happiness  you know what is joy  you should remember that maybe give more than three dollars next time  yeah well three dollars a miles will end up like fifty bucks  so god cant even calculate what youre gonna have to give  is oscar around  i just thought it was a kind of a flat you know  twentyfive dollars one time donation  didnt think it was a permile kind of deal you know so   well thats what a walkathon is  i know  it says here right on the sheet  look look at the sheet it says its however many dollars permile  got it yes so it does  i just think its kind of cheap to undonate money to a charity  no no no no i wasnt i wasnt no no  its its not about the money  its just it it its the ethics of the thing  oscar  hows your nephew is he in a good shape   yeah  how many miles did he do last year   last year he walked eighteen miles  son of a bitch  that is impressive good for him   happy birthday meredith  read it out loud  say who wrote everything so we
