                looking good ill go five  five here  and five more  i believe the wiser course of action here is to bend  you mean fold data  that is correct fold to bend to make compact or to capitulate  i raise 50  i do not believe lt worf understands all the nuances of betting  i wouldnt judge his piles a lot bigger than yours  than any of ours  the cards have favoured lt worf but that is the result of chance  thus a temporary situation   you hope  talk or play not both   your feet getting cold  my cards are getting cold here you go  im glad you stayed in i need the chips  talk talk talk  ok heres the action   fold fold fold  your 50 and 50 more  id love to play but not with these cards  looks like its just us handsome  ill see you   beats my straight  the iceman wins again  you took my last chip at least smile worf  that would break his concentration  your deal  the game is sevencard stud  after the queen oneeyed jacks and low card in the hole are wild  wait let me write this down  i open with 50  bridge to cmdr riker  receiving a class11 emergency signal from starfleet command  on my way    klingons never bluff  yeah right   mr data  emergency signal reads as follows  enterprise to divert to coordinates   further orders to follow  thats it whats the emergency  the message did not elaborate sir  not even a hint   course laid in  warp eight  when starfleet gets enigmatic i know were facing a challenge engage  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  our destination is a point near the boradis system  that area was colonized recently as i recall  the first federation outpost was founded 34 years ago on boradis iii  the federation has since colonized several planets nearby  yet we are not headed for a colony  the coordinates are outside the system   any problems reported in that area  none sir  what the devil is going on  captain starfleet command is hailing us  about time on screen   greetings capt picard  my compliments admiral gromek  you will soon be joined by a special emissary from starbase 153  we are now transmitting the specifics  we are receiving sir  the rendezvous will be tricky  so you must reach the intercept point on schedule  understood and the mission  the envoy will fill you in you are to cooperate fully   can you give me any details  negative  its rather difficult to prepare for a mission i know nothing about  i sympathize but starfleet command considers this a topsecurity matter  once the envoy has briefed you you should understand our caution  gromek out  data what ship is transporting the envoy  apparently there were no starships available on starbase 153  the envoy is aboard a class8 probe  a class8 probe is just over two meters long  yes thats true number one  with transmitters and sensors removed and a lifesupport system installed  there would be room for one person  and it can travel at warp nine  by sending the probe to us rather than diverting us  they are saving us 61 hours  starfleet must feel time is of the essence  but to seal someone inside a class8 probe and launch it  what a way to transport a federation dignitary  coming to 31 mark 113  our course is now parallel to the probe sir  increase speed to warp 89    full sensors aft  scanning  data project our course beyond the rendezvous what lies ahead  from what i can tell very little  there are four colonies and nine outposts throughout the sector  i have it bearing 05 mark 231 velocity warp nine   i see it  adjust speed to intercept  probe is coming up to starboard range 8200 tractor beam ready   mr la forge  transporter ready captain  range now 7500  steady as she goes   probe is standing abeam  engage tractor beam   transporter beam locked captain  energize   probe aboard captain  acknowledged number one   ill welcome our visitor  resume original course and speed  aye sir  all yours commander  something wrong doctor  im not sure the readings are quite interesting  i greet you i am kehleyr  you speak klingon  a little im cmdr riker this is chief medical officer pulaski  i hope your trip wasnt too unpleasant  klingons do not mind hardship but i am delighted im out of that coffin  i dont blame you its not the most luxurious accommodation  whoever said getting there is half the fun never rode in a probe  how are you feeling your vital signs are atypical for a klingon  because i am only half klingon  yes my father was klingon my mother was human  captain allow me to present special federation emissary kehleyr  welcome aboard im jeanluc picard  this is counsellor troi lt cmdr data   and this is lt  worf  so this is where youve been hiding i told you wed meet again   arent you going to greet me  i have nothing to say to you  havent changed a bit  well i missed you too  two days ago starbase 336 received an automated transmission  from a klingon ship the tong  that ship was sent out over 75 years ago  when the federation and the klingons were at war  the message was to klingon high command  it said that the ship was going home and was nearing its awakening point  suggesting that the crew were in cryogenic sleep for the journey   exactly  and when theyre revived  well have a ship full of klingons who think the wars still going on  so our task is to find the ship and tell them theyre not at war  why us wouldnt a klingon ship be better  a klingon ship the prang is two days behind us it may be too late  why too late  the tong crew will awaken near several federation outposts  there are 13 colonies in that sector  nice ripe targets for a klingon warship  and you think you can convince them that humans are now their allies  no not a chance  i think talking will be a waste of time  klingons of that era were raised to despise humans  well try diplomacy but i promise you it wont work  then youll have to destroy them  no  no captain these klingons are killers youll have no choice  we shall find another choice  i want options before we encounter the klingon ship  lieutenant  im assigning you to help the emissary  dismissed  i will escort you to the guest quarters  captain  lieutenant  sir i suggest cmdr riker or data can better serve the special emissary  any personal reasons you dont want the assignment  yes  any professional reasons  no   i withdraw my request captain  good  i didnt know humans and klingons could produce children  actually the dna is compatible with a fair amount of help  rather like my parents  i know what you mean my father was human and my mother is betazoid  really it was the other way round for me my mother was human  you must have grown up like me trapped between cultures  i never felt trapped  i tried to experience the richness and diversity of the two worlds  perhaps you got the best of each  myself i think i got the worst of each   i doubt that  yes  having my mothers sense of humour is bad enough  its gotten me into plenty of trouble  and your klingon side  that i keep under tight control  its like a terrible temper not something i want people to see   everyone has tempers  not like mine  sometimes i feel theres a monster inside of me fighting to get out  and it frightens you  of course it does my klingon side can be terrifying  even to me  it gives you strength its a part of you  that doesnt mean i have to like it  you are late  sorry had to make myself beautiful  i fail to understand why  worf were alone now you dont have to act like a klingon glacier  i dont bite  well thats wrong i do bite  shall we proceed with our duties  you werent this aloof six years ago or dont you remember  nothing is wrong with my memory  something is wrong with you youre not even looking at me  i am familiar with your appearance  and it gives you no pleasure to see me again  it isnt as if we tried it and it didnt work you know  you never gave it a chance  i never  i mean as i see it  we have some  unfinished business you and i  not as far as im concerned  according to the library computer the captain of the tong is ktemoc  there is nothing on the ships mission  probably some secret military objective  perhaps but we have no evidence of that  why else would there be no record of the mission  the records may simply have been lost  what does it matter our concern is the present the possible threat  to contend with that threat we need information  we have all the information we need  that is foolish knowing their mission may help us understand them  there is nothing to understand these are klingons theyll attack  in their minds were the enemy and we cant talk them out of that  and i do not appreciate being interrupted  and i do not appreciate wasting my time  we were instructed to find options  there arent any the assignments hopeless   there are always options  are there  tell me whatever happened to that wonderful klingon fatalism of yours  my experiences aboard this ship have taught me  most problems have more than one solution  starfleet hasnt improved you one bit youre as stubborn as ever  are you going to carry out your duties or arent you  alright i will  upon due consideration of the problem  and careful examination of all possible options  my original recommendation stands  meeting adjourned  come  youre upset  your finely honed betazoid sense tell you that  well that and the table  i warned you about my klingon half  may i make a suggestion  i thank you counsellor but i dont want any counselling  i was going to suggest something else  i find the exercise programs on the holodeck  rigorous enough to take my mind off most frustrations  and itll keep me from wrecking the ship  that too   enter program  show me the exercise menu  hold  callisthenics program of lt worf  program complete you may enter when ready  status mr data  based on the last position of the klingon ship  its trajectory and estimates of its speed  we should be within scanner range in 15 hours eight minutes  lieutenant  special emissary kehleyr has declared a short recess sir  i wish to run a test on tactical backup equipment   we just tested all those systems  i wish to check them again  lieutenant  i commend your diligence  however im concerned that youre working yourself too hard  sir given the unknowns we will face   lieutenant i order you to relax  i am relaxed  yes sir  ive never before seen the lieutenant so unsettled  the icemans finally melting  not much of a program  computer   level two  some callisthenics programs are better than others  you still can make jokes   you dont like a sense of humour  i did not say that  worf youre the perfect klingon the ultimate minimalist talk to me  ive noted that some people use humour as a shield  they talk much yet say little  whereas others take a simpler approach  say nothing  when one does not have the words  or is loath to speak them  why didnt we do this six years ago   we were not ready  i was  no we were both too young too unaware  we lacked commitment  perhaps we lacked courage as well  no longer  wait you cant mean  we are mated  yes i know i was there but  now we must solemnize our union with the oath  i am not going to become your wife  you already are  dont give me that klingon nonsense  you would dishonour our sacred traditions  theyre not sacred theyre absurd  marrying you is out of the question for a million reasons  they didnt stop you earlier  worf it was what it was glorious and wonderful and all that  but it doesnt mean anything  that is a human attitude   i am human  you are also klingon  so that means we should bond for life  it is our way  yours not mine  i will not take the oath  then this night had no meaning  and that i will not believe  believe what you will   approaching the coordinates  slow to impulse  short and longrange sensor scans negative  lay in a standard search pattern   search pattern laid in  full impulse engage  i hope we find them before they end their nap  agreed  no outpost in this area could defend itself from a klingon warship  im working on our assignment trying a few computer simulations  your devotion to duty is commendable if belated  unwilling to be alone with me  i asked cmdr data to help us analyze the alternatives  an android chaperon  android of course is correct but  i fail to see how chaperon is applicable here  never mind  i guess i cant blame you  tell me one thing youd have gone through with the oath wouldnt you  regardless of the consequences to our careers to our lives  honour demanded no less  what do you want is honour all you care about  dont you feel anything else  no comment  poor android whose behaviour do you find more perplexing  human or klingon  at the moment i would find it difficult to choose  so would i  ok when we locate the tong there are two possibilities first  we find the ship before it reaches the awakening point  and simply keep them asleep   is that feasible  we can override their controls  that way we await the arrival of the klingon ship prang  so when the tongs crew awakens they are surrounded by klingons   that would be ideal  but theres the second possibility  that the crew of the tong has already revived  they see this is federation territory and attack an outpost  theirs could be a scientific voyage  klingons of that era doing research for its own sake   but they may be reasonable  that point is beside the point  these are klingons at war with us  whatever their mission once they see a federation target theyll attack  can they be disabled rather than destroyed  we could knock out their engines without damaging the ship  no use disable the ship and ktemoc will destroy it himself  klingons do not surrender  if we dont reach it before they wake up you have no alternatives  i cant accept that  there must be some way to make the klingons listen   if we convince them  captain weve detected a ship  bearing 316 mark 42  extreme sensor range  lay in intercept course go to yellow alert  shields are up  better lock in phasers it may be your only chance  intercept course laid in  hold position lets see if theyve spotted us  magnification 100  mr data  life forms are aboard unable to ascertain whether they are awake  their propulsion is inactive so i hypothesize that they are asleep  however i could be in error  shields holding  theyve cloaked themselves  well captain youve had your chance  transferring engineering to the bridge  can you find them  i think so those old shields werent too efficient  at blocking gammaray output  if i can tune the sensors to a particular band  there got em transferring coordinates to helm   intercept warp two  warp two sir  let them die like klingons in battle they deserve that much  captain  i have another option  captains log stardate 429013  despite their cloaking shields we have located the klingon vessel  in an effort to avoid confrontation we plan to implement the option  presented by lt worf  the tong has changed course to 32 mark 81  increasing to warp three   standard evasive manoeuvre  stay with them  yes sir  the tong is now on a heading of 42 mark 113 accelerating to warp five   theyre making a break for it  overtake warp eight  aye  put us right in their path come to a full stop full power to shields  weve thrown down the gauntlet lets see if they pick it up  slowing to impulse sir  phaser hit on forward shields brimming up now no damage  i guess weve piqued their interest now  agreed  give them a chance to look their enemy in the face ready lieutenant   open hailing frequencies  open sir  what  what is this  captain ktemoc have you lost your mind  halt your vessel and drop your shields  what treachery is this by whose authority  i am worf commanding the enterprise  and it is you who have committed treason by firing on this vessel  i have standing orders to fire on all federation ships  you fool  did it not occur to you that the war would be over by now   i have no proof of that  trust your eyes  or is your brain still stuck in its long slumber  how do i know this is no federation trick how can i be sure  captain as you are new to this century i have tried to be patient  but i will tolerate no further insubordination   drop your shields immediately  and if i refuse  then die in ignorance i can waste no more time on you  phasers to full power  aye sir phasers ready target locked  you dare not destroy us  we are on a crucial mission for klingon high command  has the tong dropped its shields  no sir  very well fire all phasers  wait  lower the shields  i yield command of the tong to you capt worf  long live the klingon empire  a wise decision captain  cmdr kehleyr will board and take command  the klingon cruiser prang will soon arrive and escort you home   and captain  yes  welcome to the 24th century  i return command to you captain  thank you lieutenant congratulations  a very fine first command well done  how did you like command  comfortable chair  and you wore it well  one to beam aboard the tong  all set  i relieve you  yes lieutenant  the klingon prang will rendezvous with you in three days  and ill begin the assimilation of these klingons to our era  is there anything else you require  no nothing else  damn you worf  youd let me go without saying another word wouldnt you  what needs to be said  nothing everything were about to go our separate ways again  and that disturbs you  i hid the truth from you last night did have meaning  i was tempted to take the oath with you but it scared me  ive never had such strong feelings toward anyone  nor have i  then it was more than just a point of honour  maybe someday when our paths cross again   i wont be so easy to get rid of  i will not be complete without you
