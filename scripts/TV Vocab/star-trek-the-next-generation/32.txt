                captains log stardate 424948  the enterprise is bound for star station india  to rendezvous with a starfleet medical courier  weve been told only that our presence is imperative  hopefully it will give me further opportunities  to assess the performance of our new chief medical officer  come   you wanted to see me captain  yes counsellor  come sit down  counsellor  youve had the opportunity  to observe dr pulaski for some time now  how would you evaluate her as a chief medical officer  ive never met a more dedicated physician  i would say she has a passion for her work  yes of course  i entirely agree  is it possible that such consuming dedication  could interfere with her judgement  i feel your concern captain but i dont share it  perhaps because ive been able to spend more time with her  and get to know her better  yes perhaps youre right  captain were picking up a faint distress signal  on an open subspace frequency  it appears to be from an adjacent sector  respond on the same frequency   are we locked on  aye sir  a voice transmission from the uss lantree a federation supply ship  uss lantree this is picard of the enterprise  what is your emergency  cant hold out any more  people dying too many to help  still receiving their signal but there is no message  lantree are you under attack  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  uss lantree this is the enterprise  come in lantree  replay that last transmission  cant hold out any more people dying too many to help  have we a fix on her  bearing 30 at 145 degrees sir  number one  wed better take a look what kind of vessel is she  a class6 federation supply ship assigned to the gamma 7 sector  capt li telaka commanding normal complement 26 officers and crew   armed  class3 defensive only   is she still underway  aye sir  adjust course to intercept warp seven  adjusting course to intercept warp seven sir  engineering transfer to bridge  closing on the lantree captain  take us out of warp establish parallel course match speed  yes sir   hailing frequencies  open  lantree this is the enterprise  capt telaka this is picard of the enterprise do you read me  no life signs captain   counsellor  nothing captain  what else have we got nearby  no other vessels of any kind within two parsecs  no battle damage  all systems seem functional sir everything is in perfect order   we have to board her captain  possibly mr worf number one  if we gain control of her remotely  we could activate the view screen and at least look at the bridge  agreed  computer security override request  identify  picard jeanluc captain uss enterprise  request control access starfleet ship uss lantree  isao telaka commanding  enter access code  omicron omicron alpha yellow daystar 27 enable  i have verified receipt of the lantrees access codes  grand commence operations   first shut down the engines  standing by  the lantree computer reports access codes received and accepted sir   sickbay on alert captain  the lantree is responding sir  we have override control of her bridge captain  alright lets have a look  lantree bridge monitor engaging  read anything doctor  still no signs of life captain  magnify  that must be capt telaka on the left lets look at him  closer  my god  looks like they had a battle with time  and lost  heart lungs liver everything   what is it  they died of natural causes  natural causes what in nature could cause that  for the record they died of old age  weve downloaded the lantrees log sir  play back the captains last entry  captains log stardate 424931 there are only six of us left  weve set course for the nearest federation outpost  but im afraid its too late  attempts to analyze what is happening have failed  in the last few hours ive watched friends grow old and die  and its happening to me  capt li telaka uss lantree  capt telaka was my age sir  doctor  every member of the lantree crew had a complete examination  eight weeks ago they were in perfect health  nothing else since  a single medical entry  noting that the first officer had thelusian flu five days ago  thelusian flu  an exotic but harmless rhinal virus it couldnt have caused this  the lantrees last port of call  was the darwin genetic research station on gagarin iv  three days ago  it could be something the crew had or it couldve come from gagarin  at the very least the people from darwin station deserve a warning  we may have to consider quarantine   we should quarantine the lantree  absolutely  lieutenant initiate the lantrees quarantine transmitters  and activate marker beacons well need to find her again  aye sir  quarantine warnings active on all frequencies captain  extreme caution  uss lantree is a quarantined vessel by order of starfleet command  set course for gagarin iv warp seven  course and speed set sir  engage  captains log supplemental  were en route to the federation research station on gagarin iv  the mere thought of a connection between the lantree tragedy  and a geneticresearch facility fills me with great apprehension   approaching gagarin iv sir  standard orbit   hailing frequencies  open  darwin this is capt jeanluc picard of the uss enterprise  enterprise this is darwin station im dr kingsley  weve just declared a medical emergency we need your help  dr kingsley what is the nature of your emergency   to whom am i speaking please  dr pulaski chief medical officer  katherine pulaski author of models of viral propagation   that was long ago  but still the standard  i cant think of anyone better to deal with  were experiencing the rapid onset of geriatric phenomena  the first symptom is sudden acute arthritic inflammation  then the ageing process accelerates  the lantree  dr pulaski i celebrated my 35th birthday a week ago  we know darwin station is involved in genetic research  is there a possible connection  our research is on human genetics  this is not something that got away from us  we believe we were infected by a supply ship three days ago  if youre speaking of the lantree we encountered it a few hours ago  all the crew were dead  which would confirm our suspicion  could you establish a pathology doctor  doctor did you hear me all the  i heard you captain the prognosis is alarming  but my concern is our children  children  they represent years of genetic research you must evacuate them  im sorry but until we know whats going on  im imposing a full quarantine on darwin station  but the children have been in protective isolation  they show no symptoms you cannot leave them to die  doctor our options in a quarantine situation are very limited  we will consider the possibilities i suggest you do the same  i recommend against contact  number one  i have to agree the risk is too great  doctor  if the children are free of disease they should be evacuated  id like to bring one aboard in a force field for an examination  counsellor do you sense anything  dr kingsley sincerely believes the children are not a threat  but shes not telling the whole truth i recommend caution  we have only dr kingsleys assurance that the children are not infected  whereas we have seen the results of this disease firsthand  in a case like this i think we should err on the side of caution  alright  we could beam up one child encased in styrolite in suspended animation  that way i could scan for possible infection  without danger to ourselves or the child   we dont know what to look for  exactly  and we wont until we start gathering data   captain thats worth some risk  theres always risk doctor  undertake an examination but i shall need positive proof  that these children are harmless before i place my crew in jeopardy   the force fields ready captain  activate it  transporter  this is chief obrien sir almost ready   is there a problem  its the styrolite  im altering the deltat so it materializes two microseconds ahead   it has to be right  take your time  entering corrections now  ready captain  dr kingsley are you ready to transport  you have the coordinates we have a 12yearold male in styrolite  transporter  energize   a trick  reverse  one moment hes still in stasis  the styrolite is intact captain  force field down  captain theres a definite presence a distinct personality  even in stasis its quite strong the child is certainly telepathic  a child this mature  we could be looking at the future of humanity  at least dr kingsleys vision of it  hes in better health than we are  his immune system is so advanced he may be unable to contract disease  i want to free him from the styrolite  that seems rather risky  i can do no further tests until hes out  but what if youre wrong you saw what happened on the lantree   i know im right  i cant expose us  not till we know more about the disease  naturally well establish a forcefield containment  but if we lose the force field we lose the ship   force fields can fail and  we dont have much time  the children cant survive in the lab once their parents die  look at him captain  hes a human being who needs help   but the risk is  minimal  if you can show that hes biologically harmless  without risk to the crew ill do everything in my power to assist  and doctor god knows im not one to discourage input  but i would appreciate it if you let me finish my sentences occasionally  deanna do you have a minute  youve known the captain for some time i need some advice   i dont deal with him well  meaning  my arguments dont have any effect we just end up quoting regulations  he has such a dedication to his ship  he doesnt seem able to see the human side of things  whats the matter  kate i dont think hed be where he is  if he couldnt see the human side   perhaps the two of you are similar  what do you mean  lets just say you both have wellestablished personalities  dr kingsley this is kate pulaski  do you have a decision   im afraid its bad news  how can that be  the risk is too great  until we know the cause of the disease  the children are harmless  every test on them has been negative  i demand that you do something to save them please doctor  for gods sake we havent got much time  stand by ill get back to you  geordi i need your help  what is it  i need to prove the children are harmless in a failsafe environment  theres no area of the ship that can be sealed off with certainty  sickbay has an isolated system  but its not possible to totally cut it off  the only independent environment would be say a shuttlecraft  a shuttlecraft why didnt you say so  come  captain id like permission to put the boy in a shuttlecraft  i can study him there without risk to anyone   what about you  ill take that risk  someone has to breathe the same air he breathes to touch him  im volunteering to make that test myself  doctor you have a responsibility to this ship which  i also have a responsibility to humanity  the guidelines about contact with quarantined  you dont have to quote the rule book  you were saying  request approved  captain you said if i  approved  i recognize that youre trying to satisfy my condition  thank you   you sent for me  i did  youre qualified to pilot this shuttlecraft  certainly i had training in auxiliary space vessels  at starfleet academy i received  a more than passing grade no doubt come aboard we dont have much time  shuttle bay three force field activated  the captain definitely approved this  youll take us a few hundred meters out and hold position  begin shuttlecraft launch sequence  good luck doctor  we are in position doctor  its the only way to prove theyre harmless  and if they are not  i hate to keep reminding you but you are a machine youll be safe  that is by no means certain but i was referring to you  medical research is sometimes a risky business  its all part of being human shall we proceed  ready to transport  you have the coordinates chief obrien   maintain position stand by  standing by   control whats our status  we have a green panel   stand by to transport  aye sir  energize  yes i do  i understand you perfectly  how could you doctor he has not said anything  yes he has troi is right hes telepathic   time  0322 exactly  shes been in direct contact with the boy for 18 minutes  all systems functioning within normal specifications  the manufacturer will be pleased  i appreciate your help but your bedside manner needs work  bedside manner  doctor  doctor i dont understand what has happened  there was no warning   explain  arthritic inflammation  the first symptom of the disease   what can we do  return the boy  apparently the children are carriers  chief obrien are you ready  i have the coordinates of the isolation lab   quickly  shuttle one hold position  holding  stand by to transport  it wasnt your fault  tell us what you need doctor  theres nothing you can do  i wont make myself an exception to the darwin quarantine  shuttle one out   what is your condition doctor  not exactly up to factory specs  im sorry the pain is tolerable thank you  shall i set course for darwin  were already under quarantine what do we have to lose  the darwin station crisis is no longer our most immediate concern  although dr pulaskis condition is linked with that emergency  her safe return and that of cmdr data must take priority please  shouldnt dr pulaski be involved in this  dr pulaski may not have time to help herself  i suggest we beam them both back here  cmdr data is most likely immune and surely the biofilter will  the biofilter wont protect us  the boy was transported twice and still infected dr pulaski  couldnt we adjust the biofilter  alter it to screen out the cause of the disease  but we dont know the cause  we cant protect ourselves against the unknown  we need a filter that doesnt depend on known biological factors   we might try the trace  the transporter trace  the transporter keeps a record of all transmissions a pattern  usually its stored for security purposes  but if we use the trace to control the reconstitution process  i dont think its been tried before but theoretically it is possible  it means extensive modifications   do it theres no alternative  where do we get the trace pattern   shes never used our transporter  never  no shes a woman of very strongly held opinions   what was her previous assignment  her ship was the repulse  bridge picard  contact the uss repulse using subspace captains priority channel  dr pulaski i can only tell you  how much i regret the burden weve imposed on you on both of you  cmdr data is an android hes unaffected  as for me i chose this i was convinced the children were safe  i still cant believe one of our children infected you  the evidence is fairly conclusive  but they were designed to resist disease  i think its time we talked about that  let me show you  our ultimate achievement  the oldest is 12 and all are telekinetic watch  genetically engineered  not engineered created perfect in every way  their body structure their musculature their minds  you were telling me about their immune system  that was our masterpiece  we gave these children an aggressive immunity  we others were infected by the supply ship but they were protected  the lantree logs show only one crewman had any illness  prior to arrival here  the first officer had a mild thelusian flu  yes he was one who came into contact with us  the thelusian flu would have no effect on you  but tell me how would they react  their immune systems would release an antibody to attack the virus  even at a distance  their immune systems dont wait for a diseases attack  it seeks out a virus and destroys it  destroy it how exactly  the antibody would adapt itself  to alter the genetic code of the virus  commander i want an analysis  of the interaction between the thelusian flu and the children  on a molecular genetic level  we dont have time for that genetic analysis could take months  not necessarily cmdr data has a way with computers  sorry picard we erased dr pulaskis transporter pattern  she never used the transporter much she preferred shuttles  id have given her a shuttle to keep her  if she served you as well as you say why did you let her go  you havent run into her stubborn streak yet  she found out about an opening on the enterprise  and requested a transfer  knew your service record backward and forward  apparently shes been an admirer of yours for some time  extraordinary  commander what have you got  the answer i believe doctor  the lantree was not the source of the disease but the trigger  trigger  the lantree exposed your children to thelusian flu for the first time  their active immune systems set out to attack the virus  once it was triggered it kept going  the antibody created an unexpected sideeffect  it alters the genetic makeup of normal humans  this is a comparison of the altered and normal dna  these two molecules have been transposed  and since our dna is selfreplicating the process  is irreversible  judging from what happened on the lantree  anyone is a carrier once theyre infected   have you made progress doctor  im afraid so  the children dont carry the disease they cause it   how  their advanced immune system  has created an antibody that changes normal dna  the altered genes are the ones that control ageing  why did it attack you more quickly than the others  the enclosed environment of the shuttle concentrated my exposure  the lantrees first officer carried the antibody onto his ship   it then affected his crew  whats the next step  the children will survive but the rest of us are about out of time  doctor i want you back aboard  youll come up in suspended animation that will buy time  thank you but i got into this by leaping before i looked  i wont allow you to make the same mistake  chief medical officers log  this will be my final report to the enterprise  just as changes in evolution  are known to be caused by changes in the environment  we now know the process also works in reverse  an attempt to control human evolution  has resulted in a new species thats lethal to its predecessors  the children will be condemned to live out their lives in isolation  quarantine of the darwin station must be maintained for ever   i am sorry i was not more helpful  you did everything you could  as androids go youre in a class by yourself  doctor  please give my best to the captain  enterprise cmdr data ready to beam aboard  captain kate knew what she was doing  i wish i were sure wed tried everything  cmdr data is ready to come aboard  you have the bridge number one  no life forms present sir  you may step down sir  data tell me if its good to see you again  thank you  if the changes in dr pulaskis dna were reversed is it possible  it is not reversible sir the molecular transposition  but if it were undone would she be normal again  as normal as ever sir  the transporter can be modified to filter out changes in dr pulaski  yes but we couldnt locate her trace pattern  well what if we used a sample of her dna  say from a blood test taken before she was exposed to the disease  could that filter the genetic changes  id have to patch in a molecular matrix reader  thats no problem  but the waveform modulator will be overloaded without the limiter  interesting but theoretically   can you do it  i think so  then make it so  you heard lets get those panels off  a blood test a tissue sample anything with dr pulaskis dna  no sir her records were shipped via starfleet headquarters   theyve not caught up with us  ridiculous  a cell a single cell lets check her quarters  anything a fingernail a hair  hairbrush  it has a follicle sir live cells  darwin station this is the enterprise  go ahead captain im here  we may have a solution  we have a sample of your normal dna  to use as a filter in the transporter  we think that we can beam you aboard  while filtering out the genetic problems caused by the disease  interesting theory captain  if it works we could use the same technique  to save dr kingsley and her colleagues  i think you should know this has never been attempted before  i know one thing  if i live through this  il have a much better understanding of geriatrics   all set chief  almost ready just one thing   yes  this modifications one way only  if it fails we cant transport the doctor back to the planet  then ill operate the transporter controls myself  if shes going to be consigned to oblivion then  thank you sir ill be monitoring the medical scans  youll be able to tell if its worked by watching the stack  dr pulaski are you ready  i suppose i am captain  here we go  its not working  captain wait   doctor  good to see you  welcome back doctor come  captain if this hadnt worked  if this hadnt worked  it would have been necessary to beam your energy into empty space  and spread my atoms across the galaxy  yes im sorry  no dont be sorry  every time i get into that thing im sure thats whats going to happen  chief medical officers log supplemental  the adults of darwin station have been restored to normal health  they remain on gagarin iv to continue their research  in hopes of one day rejoining their children  impulse speed  there she is captain  scientists believe no experiment is a failure  that even a mistake advances the evolution of understanding  close to 40 kilometers   but all achievement has a price  for one glimpse at the mysterious blueprint of human evolution  the crew of the uss lantree paid with their lives  their sacrifice is thus noted in this scientists log
