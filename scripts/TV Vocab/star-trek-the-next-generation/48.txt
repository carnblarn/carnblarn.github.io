                riker to ensign crusher  go ahead   forget to set your alarm wesley  yes sir  im very sorry ill be right there  captains log stardate 431258  we have entered a spectacular binary star system  in the kavis alpha sector on a mission of astrophysical research  our eminent guest dr paul stubbs  will attempt to study the decay of neutronium  expelled at relativistic speeds from a massive stellar explosion  which will occur here in a matter of hours  ensign our position  one million kilometers from the neutron star  slow to onethird impulse power   spectacular isnt it my friend  yes sir  over and over again  the gravitational pull of the little neutron star  sucks up the star material from the red giant  and it builds up on the surface until it explodes every 196 years  like clockwork  and it is but 1 8 hours away  and ten seconds doctor  the interstellar counterpart to earths old faithful  the only predictable burst of energy in the universe  that can accomplish our goal  if youd like to make one final inspection  captain i have been inspecting the egg for the last 20 years  you may lay it when ready  begin launch sequence  shuttlebay two stand by to launch the egg  standing by commander  five minutes to launch site   stabilize  the ship isnt responding sir  engineering report mr la forge  checking inertial dampeners instruments say theyre working  were heading into the path of that stellar matter  shields up  negative the shields will not respond  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilisations  to boldly go where no one has gone before    manual override on shields  shields are rising  reset dampeners mr la forge  not responding unable to reset   reverse impulse engines  initiating reverse sequence now  our momentum is still carrying us into the path of the stellar matter   1 2 seconds to impact sir  prepare for impact  medical personnel report to the bridge  cmdr data check all systems  systems functioning normally  computer explain control malfunction  no control malfunction has been recorded  lay down carefully there you go  dr stubbs the captain says our systems are back to normal  we can try another launch when youre ready  quite a dynamic family team you crushers  its nice to be together again  i was at starfleet medical for a year i missed two inches of him  im not sure id want my mother to be flying through space with me  no i take that back i am sure i wouldnt want her  my mother is a formidable woman too  a woman of letters a great critic  i know  good lord son you didnt read that unauthorized biography  is this all he does fly the ship and read doesnt he have fun  sure he does  most of my free time is taken up with my studies  i want to get into starfleet academy  i earn credits being on the enterprise but its not the same  you ready to sit up  well i am whole again  thank you doctor  come along wesley lets go see if humptydumpty is in one piece  computer fix the food slot  the food slot is functioning properly  well check again  the food slot is functioning properly  deactivate food slot  were analyzing the systems data theres nothing unusual  in the computer log for that time period  run a levelone diagnostic series come  i want a computer thats 100 percent to expedite dr stubbs experiment  as well as the food slots in sickbay picard out  which are working again for the moment  what can i do for you doctor  jeanluc how would you feel if you were a 17yearold  and the only starfleet officer whose mother was on board  inhibited i suppose  but then im not wesley  if you are concerned about him i see no evidence of a problem  i know but in a funny way thats exactly my point  we talk we smile its almost too polite  beverly isnt it just a matter of time  i know how difficult it was for you being away  tell me about him  well hes becoming a very fine officer  he works as hard as any member of the crew   his studies are on line  no tell me about him  hes his fathers son  honest trusting  strong  does he have many friends  has he ever been in love  jeanluc im worried  hes come so far so fast  and since ive been back i dont feel  his dependence  beverly look hes 17 years old  what were you doing when you were 1 7  getting into more trouble than wesley  so was i isnt that what 1 7 is supposed to be  no cracks in the amour well do just fine  how can you be so calm  if i were about to make a breakthrough  i have never doubted for a moment that this day would come  and i suspect that someday it will come for you as well  i see a lot of me in you  in my youth they called me a wunderkind  do you understand wunderkind  its german isnt it  it means wonder child  it is reserved for those of us who achieve early in life   now the burden is yours  burden  to fulfill your potential  you will never come up against a greater adversary  than your own potential  red alert return to quarters  still no visual contact thats impossible  mr worf same magnification  worf youre absolutely sure  sensors indicate the approach of a borg vessel  shields up  shields are not responding  manual override is jammed we dont have the shields captain   theyre firing energy weapons  evasive action  bring her round to 275 mark three  predict vector of borg vessel  vector  is gone  and so is the borg ship  is this another computer glitch  it could be a syntheticallygenerated image  our computer was daydreaming  computer identify malfunction  pawn to bishop four knight to kings rook three  bishop to queens bishop four  knight to knight five queens knight  controls are not responding sir  queen to bishop three   impulse engines are down  try warp engines  no sorry id better get back to engineering  mr la forge i want lt worf to accompany you  report on the prospects of getting our shields back  number one mr data join me in the conference room  its time to discuss the future of this mission if there still is one  we are dealing with the potential breakdown of the main computer  thats hard to accept  the system provides for selfcorrection  there has been no systemswide technological failure  on a starship in 79 years  excuse me captain dr stubbs is waiting outside  captain im sure you have everything under control  id just like to know whats going on  of course doctor sit down counselor  cmdr la forge is attempting repairs even as we speak  attempting doesnt sound particularly reassuring  if possible we will continue this mission as planned  captain if we miss our chance now  we dont get another for two centuries  starfleet will ask many questions if the enterprise fails in its duty  nevertheless my foremost consideration  is to ensure the safety of this ship and its crew  ensure the safety captain  or are you really talking about playing it safe  doctor in our current position when that star explodes  youll get to watch your experiment from the inside out  i would rather die than leave  you dont speak for the majority of the crew  i know how much this means to you  my dear counselor no insult intended  but please turn off your beam into my soul  i will share the feelings i wish to share  well if we do not leave in time so be it  its one sure way into the record books eh  his nonchalance is studied and practiced  even my sensory perception picked that up  hes put his entire selfworth on the line with this experiment  its the truth when he says hed rather die than leave  call up the crosssection of core processor 451  i want to see elements 0200 to 0300  aye sir  in order to get some power i had to essentially hotwire the connection  whoa right there  look at that lesion no wonder were coming apart  its some kind of continuing disintegration  but from what i cant tell  i have no idea how to stop it  its just a mechanical problem  increase magnification factor 50  i dont know wes but looking at it  you know if i didnt know any better  id say somebody had climbed in and started taking it apart  guinan  i didnt think anyone would be here  im no good at being confined to quarters  as my husbands will attest to whats that  im just setting traps   i run a clean place  i know its not that  its  im scared guinan  i think that everything thats gone wrong might be my fault  want to tell me about it  im doing my final project for advanced genetics  its on nanotechnology  i studied the nanites in the sickbay supplies  these tiny robots with gigabytes of mechanical computer memory  theyre designed to enter living cells and conduct repairs  theyre supposed to stay confined to the lab  there are nanites loose  two of them thats all  i wanted to see how theyd function in tandem  i had proposed a theory that by working together  they could combine their skills and be more useful it was working  you made better nanites  i was pulling an allnighter to collect my final data  i fell asleep when i woke up  i saw the container had been left open  its just a science project  a doctor friend once said the same thing to me  frankenstein was his name  theyre really harmless they have only basic skills  its almost impossible theyre responsible  almost  dr crusher to wesley crusher  go ahead  i assumed youd be in your quarters since youre off duty  i know i just had some things to do   orders are orders mr crusher  on my way  you wont tell anybody will you  i know i will  if its true  wes do you think youre gonna get a good grade  i always get an a  so did dr frankenstein  captains log supplemental  our computer core has been tampered with  yet there is no sign of a breach of security  we will attempt to complete our mission  but without a reliable computer  dr stubbs experiment is in jeopardy   manual restart sequence  restart successful  impulse engine functions appear normal   shuttlebay two open hangar door  aye sir  door did not respond repeating sequence  what in heavens name  it is stars and stripes forever by john philip sousa  an american composer from the 20th century   i know that  computer shut off the music  the music is on all communications channels  weapons power communications our systems are being stripped  shut off power to bridge  cmdr la forge can you get us out of this star system safely   no  not now doctor  ill try i dont want to overload the engines  do it gently but do it  well circuit in power to bridge and silence any sousa encores  the priority is to find out who or what is doing this  number one the bridge such as it is is yours   the egg that stubbs laid  no one will say that  nobody will say anything at all we will not even be mentioned  i could live with failure well maybe not  but never even to try to miss your one chance at bat  do you know baseball  yes my father taught me when i was young  once centuries ago  it was the beloved national pastime of the americas wesley  abandoned by a society that prized fast food and faster games  lost to impatience  but i have seen the great players make the great plays  do you recreate them on a holodeck  no in here  with the knowledge of statistics runs hits and errors  times at bat box scores  men like us do not need holodecks wesley  i have played seasons in my mind  it was my reward to myself for patience  knowing my turn would come  call your shot  point to a star  one great blast  and the crowd rises  a brandnew era in astrophysics  postponed 196 years  on account of rain  we have to talk  you really look like you could use some rest  i know its ok really  no its not ok really  mom im checking traps to find out whats happening to the enterprise  on someones orders  were running out of time for dr stubbs  you cant put everything on your shoulders youre always on duty   mom you dont understand  you are a 17yearold  i am also an acting officer i have responsibilities  im beginning to think youve taken on too many responsibilities  i have done everything everyone has asked of me and more  how can you know you havent been here  im here now wesley  come on ill help you what are you looking for  i think ive made a horrible mistake  nanites tiny machines built from the atom up  designed for exposure to the inside of nuclei during surgeries  until then they are tightly contained in a nonfunctioning state   these are not ordinary nanites  no they have evolved  evolved how does a machine evolve  its true  i am responsible for this  i allowed two of the nanites to interact for a school project  i wanted to increase their capabilities   and they escaped  school project  just how far have these things evolved  well this is a sample of linear memorycrystal  from our computer core  its like candy to them  they can mechanically replicate themselves  it is conceivable that with each generation  they enhance their design at an extraordinary rate of evolution  how many generations are we dealing with  engineering display computer core processor 451 element 0299  increase magnification factor 1000   can they know what theyre doing  why would they attack us  why does a mosquito bite your ear and who cares  the answer is simple call an exterminator  dr stubbs these nanites are now working  with a new collective intelligence  operating together  teaching each other new skills  oh really im sorry but this is nonsense  you cant have a civilisation of computer chips  theyre made in a plant in dakar senegal  ive watched the construction  then how do you explain what weve just seen here  its no more mysterious  than watching a strain of leutscher virus reproduce itself  that at least is a bona fide life form  how many disease germs and viruses  have you destroyed in your time dr crusher  we cannot exterminate something that may or may not be intelligent   my good captain  theres still time  ensign will you work with mr data to try to remove them safely  if things get worse well use stronger measures  gentlemen i need a computer  that is 100 percent in less than eight hours  and we still have core reconstruction to consider  were trying lowgamma bursts to slow down their productivity  have you considered a highlevel charge  that would kill them doctor  i know  i cant get the story of gulliver out of my head  overpowered by lilliputians  how long do we have to wait  we can bypass the part of the computer thats affected  but if the nanites are spreading through the whole ship  do you smell a change what  picard to la forge environmental system malfunction on the bridge   nitrogen oxide toxic levels  working on it  ive switched to manual control of the airhandling system  mr worf report  he sterilized one of the processors with gamma radiation  the nanites in the upper core are all dead  you have no choice now it is a matter of survival  dr stubbs if you were a member of my crew  but i am not a member of your crew  i am a representative of the highest command of the federation  which has directed you to perform my experiment  if any man woman or child on this ship  is harmed as a result of your experiment  i will have your head before federation command  good lord you are talking about machines with a screw loose  simply turn them off and be done with them  dr stubbs your own actions have provided evidence to the contrary  when you destroyed the nanites  they responded by interfering with our life support  these are not random actions by machines with loose screws  you may have proven that the nanites have a collective intelligence  the ship is at risk extermination may be our only choice  good point  lt worf i want dr stubbs confined to his quarters until further notice  mr data can you find me some way to communicate with these things  with intelligence there is the capability of language  it will depend on how far their evolution has brought them  we could modify the universal translator  to make it capable of communications with them  proceed  may i come in  you just cant resist can you counselor  i only want to help  yes to break the shell  to get in touch with my true feelings  im only worried about your state of mind  alright counselor what is it that has you so worried  your singlemindedness your need to have this experiment work  but it will picard has no choice now  he must defend the enterprise  counselor when this is all over  i will show you new manhattan on beth delta i  as you have never seen it  and we will laugh over glasses of champagne  your selfportrait is so practiced so polished  yes isnt it though  its stretched so tight the tension fills this room  and if you finally fail i fear it will snap  a good try counselor  but sometimes when you reach beneath a mans selfportrait  as you so eloquently put it  deep down inside what you find is nothing at all  lockman on first dark on second  thompson at the plate  branca on the mound  hes coming around  i cannot believe this was an arbitrary attack  has data been able to contact them  picard  you must protect me kill them  cmdr riker  on my signal we will gammairradiate all our computer systems  lets put an end to this conflict  worf prepare to activate gammapulse generators  electromagnetic scanners ready captain  captain  i have established contact  they are virtually learning the concept of communication  each generation is making modifications   can we talk to them yet  i believe it is worth an attempt  cmdr riker bring dr stubbs to the bridge  i dont think this is a wise idea  they have already tried to kill me once  one sure way into the record books doctor  i am ready sir  tell them the human who destroyed their comrades will address them   captain  you will explain your error  and apologize and pray we can negotiate a peace  we can all live with is that clear  captain if a facetoface negotiation would be helpful  i will volunteer to be a conduit  yourself data  i can furnish the nanites with a schematic design  of my neurological structure  it would require no more than their basic skills  thats what they were designed for  they could penetrate my hand covering enter my nerve circuitry  and interface with my verbal program  if they have control of a commander theyre an even greater threat  how can we be sure that we can get them out of you  it would be a considerable risk but would be a gesture of trust  it could be a step toward peace  alright data propose it to the nanites  the answer is yes   they are ready captain  proceed  you are very strangelooking creatures  in our travels we have encountered many other creatures  perhaps even strangerlooking than ourselves  but we try to coexist peacefully  why did you attack us  we misinterpreted your actions as an attack on us  we were seeking raw materials for our replicating process  yes but you endangered this vessel  you nearly killed a crew member  we meant no harm  we were exploring  i understand we are also explorers  we mean no harm to any other living creature  i am the one responsible for the deaths in the computer core  we know who you are  i deeply regret the incident  i am a scientist on an important mission  your colleagues exploration put our mission at risk  i was only trying to protect a lifetime of work  from being destroyed  i am at your mercy  what is at your mercy  he asks your forgiveness  this conflict was started by mistakes on both sides  lets agree to end it here and now  we  agree  i pledge we will do everything possible  to assist your continued survival  thank you  but we have evolved beyond any need for your assistance  this ship is too confining  we require relocation  captains log supplemental  dr stubbs has used his influence to have planet kavis alpha iv  designated the home of the nanite civilisation  cmdr datas neural network has been vacated  he has been returned to us unharmed  with the help of the nanites  our computer has been reconstructed in time for the experiment  ten seconds to stellar blast  from the neutron star  hold your position  doctor   do you have any children guinan  a lot  ever had trouble relating to them   just one  one  wouldnt listen to anybody  well they all go through that  not in a species of listeners  did he grow out of it  it took several hundred years but i brought him round  how  a mother shapes her child in ways she doesnt even realize  sometimes just by listening  cute couple  see now that is healthy for a boy his age  i mean that as a doctor not as just a mother  it is so good to see him having fun for a change  with an attractive young woman  who obviously looks at him with extraordinary affection  what do you know about this girl
