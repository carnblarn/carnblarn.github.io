                captain doctor i am honored by your presence  but may i suggest you attend the second concert  why data  ensign ortiz will perform the violin part  my rendition will be less enjoyable  i am technically proficient  but according to my fellow performers i lack soul  telling us why youll fail before making the attempt is never wise  but is not honesty always the preferred choice  excessive honesty can be disastrous particularly in a commander  indeed  knowing your limitations is one thing  advertising them to a crew damages your credibility as a leader  because you will lose their confidence  and you may begin to believe in those limitations yourself  captain were receiving a message from the sheliak corporate  origin of message confirmed it is from the shelia star system  the sheliak have not communicated with the federation for 111 years  why are they doing it now  on screen  federation creatures  there are humans on the fifth planet of tau cygna  this planet was ceded to the corporate in section 1 33  paragraph 77 of the treaty of armens  we will begin settlement of this world in four days   remove the humans  what the  federation creatures there are humans on the fifth planet  cancel message  tau cygna v is in the de laure belt  heavy concentrations of hyperonic radiation  humans cant survive there  hyperonic radiation is fatal  then the sheliak are asking us to chase ghosts  no number one  the sheliak havent broken a century of silence  to send us after phantoms  an investigation is in order set course for tau cygna v  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilisations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  captain humanlifeform readings from the planet   the sheliak werent hallucinating  numbers  impossible to get a reading  radiation is disrupting our sensors  radiation has also made the ships transporters inoperable  so are the phasers   how can humans survive there  they must have adapted  work with radiation sensitivity suggests its possible  perhaps with extensive viral therapy  whoever they are weve gotta get them off the planet  by treaty that world still belongs to the sheliak  who are within their rights to remove these trespassers  if we dont remove them the sheliak will forcefully  how forcefully  the sheliak consider humans a lower life form  and would have no compunctions about exterminating them  mr data as youre unaffected by hyperonic radiation  id like you to go to the planet via shuttlecraft to commence evacuation  aye sir  number one  any speculation on what we might find down there  my guess would be a lone survey craft  maybe a dozen or so survivors  i think its some sort of shuttlecraft   wheres it from  look at the markings  it must be from the federation  greetings gentlemen  we saw your ship youre the first visitor weve had  the first visitor weve ever had  youre not human  that is correct i am an android  i am lt cmdr data of the federation starship enterprise  our greatgrandparents were in the federation  you dont wanna waste time talking to us  you should meet gosheven well take you  im sure the federation will be proud of us  wait till you see all weve accomplished  and who precisely is us  dont you know oh no i dont guess you would  were descendants of the original settlers  from the colony ship artemis  got it the artemis launched  when they failed to check in starfleet began a huge search  what took the artemis off course  my local informant does not know  in the early days survival was more important than history   understood how many are they  1 5253 sir   three days no transporters well never get them out in time  shuttles  loading all shuttlecraft to capacity  evacuation will take four weeks four days  we need more time  mr data prepare the colonists for evacuation  aye sir  get me the sheliak  their homeworld is quite distant this will take some time  gosheven look whats come  lt cmdr data of the starship enterprise   hes an android  so he is  well now that youre here what do you want  my mission is to prepare this colony for evacuation  why  because this planet belongs to the sheliak  and who is the sheliak  the term is plural  the sheliak are a nonhumanoid intelligent life form class r3  well this colony has been here over 90 years  weve never seen a sheliak  id say that makes tau cygna v our planet  the original destination of the artemis was septimus minor  the guidance system failed took them far off course  our ancestors were lucky to land anywhere  then the radiation started killing them  it killed a third of the colonists before they adapted to it  our colony prospered  look around weve brought water to the desert built a community  your accomplishments are truly remarkable  yet there is a treaty which makes this planet sheliak domain   then change the treaty  that may not be possible  the sheliak wish to colonize this planet  and will not share it with humans  if you are here when they arrive they will eradicate you  theyd kill all of us  they have little regard for human life  the sensible thing is to prepare a contingency plan  for the evacuation of your people  were not evacuating   i have not made myself clear  yes you have  let me be equally clear  theres going to be no evacuation  youve delivered your message so go back to your ship  i have work to do  nice catch  wonderful reflexes  sorry to test you like that but i was curious   found a new toy have we  toy  this is the most incredible android ive ever seen  have you seen many  actually no youre the first  only you would get this excited over a walking calculator  cybernetics fascinates me   are your neural paths duotronic  no positronic  is that possible whats your memory capacity  how many operations per second i have a million questions  i have no time to answer a million  i have a mission to accomplish i must know about your people  gosheven seems unwilling to talk  im ardrian mckenzie  perhaps i can help you  gentlemen were giving you an assignment  one thing we dont want to hear is that its impossible  i need the transporters to work despite the radiation  yeah but thats im  yes sir  even if we get the sheliak to talk they wont be accommodating  when the treaty was first negotiated  the federation sent 372 legal experts  what do we have  thee and me  no response  try them again boost the signal strength  sheliak corporate this is the starship enterprise  respond please  conversation is neither required nor desired  conversation is necessary  if we are to find a solution to our mutual problem  our involvement in federation illegality is not indicated  both parties are involved sir  remove the humans from the tau cygna system  three earth days remain  let us negotiate in good faith  negotiate to what purpose the treaty is signed  there is a thriving colony on that planet  rather than uproot these people may i offer a compromise   denied  why  the law is paramount we are entitled  this is not a law it is a treaty  it is designed to smooth relations between races  not to act as a strait  jacket  you really think well have to leave tau cygna v  the possibility exists yet gosheven seems unwilling to prepare for it   why  maybe because youre an android  i dont think he likes the idea of machines ordering him around  i am not ordering him  i am trying to persuade him to evacuate his people  do you think my course of action should be followed  of course   despite the fact i am an android  because of that fact  im not prejudiced against computers i like them  not that any computer we have is as sophisticated as you  no i would say not  people can be selfish irrational stubborn malicious  but computers dont have those failings  and you conclude that i am impartial  hence you accept my recommendations  yet gosheven does not  picard to cmdr data  data here   the sheliak wont bargain  understood sir  im calling for transport get those people ready to evacuate quickly  aye sir  we must speak to gosheven immediately  gentlemen hows it coming   what the hell is that  our first attempt  keep at it we need those transporters  you see this  do you have any idea what it is or what it means  it is water a substance composed of two atoms of hydrogen  its not water  its blood and sweat the result of 90 years of combined effort  this isnt a town  its a monument to everyone whos lived and died here   youre talking nonsense  am i  my grandfather is buried on that mountain  he died in a rock slide surveying for this aqueduct  this colony exists because of his sacrifice  and the sacrifice of thousands of others  no we are not leaving  the sheliak will not accept humans on their planet  they will use force to remove you  we will not be bullied off our land not by you and not by the sheliak  stubborn and irrational now what do we do   are his sentiments typical  i hope not  if i can convince people to leave  dont you mean if we can convince   come  yes sir  three weeks starfleet is profuse in its apologies  but it will still be three weeks until the arrival of a transport ship  equipped with dedicated personnel shuttles  we cant wait three weeks  then the sheliak must agree to extend our deadline  they plan to settle tau cygna v two days from now  one of their ships must already be en route  were going to intercept that ship  the sheliak may see that as hostile  a risk we have to take  the enterprise is going to intercept the sheliak ship  now your job   well you know what your job is  commander  in human parlance i do not believe i can get the job done  my training prepared me for starship command duties  as a cultural contact i am less than exemplary   whats the situation  their leader will not listen  he denies my arguments and speaks of structures they have built   try something else  i have sir  in the last three hours i have spoken with 56 colonists  ten refused to believe the threat exists  and fighting the sheliak  or some sort of passive resistance  only eight considered evacuation of those  data i cant help you  i havent talked to these people you have  use your positronic brain to carry out your mission  sir if i do not succeed  how violent is the sheliak reaction likely to be  only the treaty stopped them  from eradicating the colony the moment they discovered it   ah  ah is right data  the lives of 1 5000 people are riding on you  youd better get innovative riker out  data  were having an effect  people are asking questions gosheven has called a meeting  has gosheven changed his position  no but you can present your recommendations  so far my attempts at persuasion have been ineffective   why did you do that  you appeared to need it  among humans a kiss usually serves to seal a friendship  or indicate support attraction affection  in this context i must assume  that your intention was to express support  you dont understand human behavior  that is an understatement  sometimes i dont either androids are a lot more rational  that quality has not helped me to accomplish my mission  a rational argument isnt always enough  maybe to be more persuasive you should use reverse psychology  elicit a desired behavior by advocating its opposite  that implies deception  a little but if it helps us get our point across  perhaps this is a situation where excessive honesty can be detrimental  are we progressing   about like youd expect sir  splendid carry on  he wants the impossible  thats the short definition of captain  you all know the android from starfleet  and youve been discussing why hes come  i called this meeting  to replace misinformation with cold hard fact   i wish to speak  no leave now  is your position so weak that it cannot withstand debate  let him speak  you all know of the sheliak threat  starfleet wishes to evacuate you for your own protection  yet gosheven has decided otherwise  that is his right  i will not waste time trying to reverse that decision  i admire your conviction in the face of certain defeat  though doomed your effort will be valiant  and when you die you will die for land and for honor  your children will understand that they are dying for a worthy cause  long after the battle is over  their courage will be remembered and extolled  remembered by who  yes that is true  there will be no one left alive to remember  a valiant try android  but what a low opinion you must have of us  i wanted to describe your destruction  in a manner with an emotional effect  he describes it pretty damn well  are you ready to follow this machine give up without a fight  he says were going to lose thats his cowardice talking  what if hes right shouldnt we consider that possibility  this colony exists because generations gave their lives for it  many died before we could adapt to the radiation  many more died bringing water to this desert   my grandfather is buried on that mountain  wholl be left to bury you  have you considered what this evacuation means  everything we have we abandon  everything that we have built turns to dust  everything that we have accomplished means nothing i say no  you elected me your leader follow me now  i dont think our chances are as hopeless as he says  and im willing to stake our lives on it  any objections  good  because here we stand   aye  we stand with you  then here you die  mr data i want you to know that gosheven doesnt speak for all of us  i see no reason to die needlessly  and you  im not sure goshevens done well for us  but i want to hear more of what you have to say  others feel the same  but they are uneasy about confronting gosheven  get them together and well meet at my house  with other nonhumanoid races  theres always been some point of reference  not so with the sheliak  we must have something in common we communicate  barely they have learnt several federation languages  but theirs continues to elude us   telepaths  attempted and failed  actually the fact that any alien race  communicates with another is quite remarkable  we are stranded on a planet  we have no language in common but i want to teach you mine   smarith what did i just say  cup   glass  are you sure  i may have meant liquid clear brown hot  we conceptualize the universe in relatively the same way  point taken  in your talks you must be extremely accurate  the treaty is 500000 words  the length was to accommodate the sheliak  they consider our language irrational  and wanted this level of complexity to avoid future misunderstandings  captain we have the vessel carrying the sheliak on visual  on my way  so it begins   hailing frequencies  open  this is capt jeanluc picard of the starship enterprise  your purpose enterprise  we desire facetoface negotiations to settle the crisis on tau cygna v  meaningless  were entitled to consultation under paragraph 653 subparagraph nine  granted   was that an invitation  i am taking it as such counselor  you have the bridge number one  helm maintain relative position  mr worf tell transporter room two to stand by  aye sir  once the federation resettles us well be left alone  if you so desire  we do we like to do things on our own  the federation will offer as little or as much help as you want  kentor are you with us  yes the question is how do we convince gosheven  why do we need to  hes respected most people will do what he says  they respect you too if you take a stand theyll fall in line  i dont know goshevens got a lot of supporters  dont forget that  im disappointed i thought wed settled this  apparently that is not correct  still stirring up trouble  since when is talk trouble  its over dont you get it  you had your say you lost  i appear to be reversing that defeat  no youre not  youre just stubborn well let me tell you something   so am i  damn you gosheven   you killed him  i killed no one  i merely shut down a machine  thats it everyone its time to go home  youll see that im right  advance and speak  director  we will comply with your request  to remove the colony from tau cygna v  but we need time  the given time has elapsed  we carry the membership  we will proceed with their debarkation  the temporary presence of humans wont interfere with your plans  unacceptable you must remove the creatures  im trying but the ship isnt available for three weeks  then you are in violation  i have admitted that  i am only asking for a little flexibility  section 501 paragraph 7 1 6 subparagraph five  unwanted life forms inhabiting hclass worlds  may be removed at the discretion of the sheliak corporate  we will remove them but you must grant us the time we require  you need time picard we will save you time  we will eradicate the human infestation  they are not vermin i will not permit this outrage  intelligent converse is impossible you do not discuss you gibber  between intelligent species of goodwill  i take it the sheliak just hung up on us again  i was afraid your neural pathways were scrambled  i have diagnostic circuits  and am able to correct many malfunctions  im not surprised at gosheven  but kentor and the others said they were with us  i guess words dont mean much  perhaps that is our difficulty words are all we have been using  humans seem to take much stronger notice of actions  i require a phaser   whats a phaser  a type of weapon  unfortunately it does not function around hyperonic radiation  i will have to be innovative  hyperonic radiation randomizes phaser beams  i think i can improvise a circuit which will compensate  by continuously recollimating the output  youre using your own neural processors to build a smarter phaser  essentially correct  get word to gosheven  tell him i am coming to the pumping station  tell him i am going to destroy the aqueduct  hell try and stop you  i sincerely hope so   go to yellow alert shields up  aye sir  riker keep close to the sheliak vessel match any move she makes   aye sir  mr worf hailing frequency  open  they are not responding  they dont have to answer they just have to listen  sheliak vessel you will have to get past me  to get at the colony on tau cygna v   no response  close channel  get me that treaty  theyve beat us over the head with it for three days  lets find something in it that we can turn to our own advantage  stop  that was the stun setting  this is not  i can reduce this pumping station to a pile of debris  but i trust my point is clear  i am but one android with a single weapon  there are hundreds of sheliak on the way  their weapons are far more powerful  they may not offer you a target  they can obliterate you from orbit  you will die never having seen the faces of your killers  the choice is yours  there are other places other challenges  yes listen to kentor  i really was willing to stay here and die for this  i know that  this is just a thing and things can be replaced  lives cannot  this is hopeless  fighting would be preferable   thats it  i dont follow you sir   mr worf get me the sheliak  yes sir  coming through sir  pursuant to paragraph 1290  i hereby request thirdparty arbitration of our dispute  you have the right  furthermore pursuant to subsection d3   i name the grisellas to arbitrate  grisellas  unfortunately they are hibernating now  theyll awaken in six months at which time we can settle this  now do you want to wait or give me my three weeks  absurd we carry the membership we can brook no delay  then i hereby declare this treaty in abeyance  wait negotiation is permiss   you enjoyed that  youre damned right  captain they are hailing us  sir  on screen  you may have your three weeks picard of the enterprise  thank you  captain we can do it we can modify the transporters  excellent  itll take 15 years and 1 00 researchers  mr la forge i believe we will postpone  yes sir  lt cmdr data to enterprise  i am about to leave tau cygna v and await rendezvous instructions  acknowledged stand by  hi the evacuation plan is going well  when the ship arrives well be ready to leave you succeeded  i only succeeded with your support and insight   i am grateful for your assistance  good   then you wont forget me  i am incapable of forgetting  i will remember every detail of my visit with perfect clarity  but nothing more  i do not understand  i guess what i really want to know is  do you have any feelings for me  i have no feelings of any kind  no of course you dont  what was that for  you appeared to need it  so you saw that i was unhappy  and did what you concluded  would make me feel better  rational to the last  bye  come   welcome home well done  thank you sir  the good doctor provided me with a recording of your concert  your performance shows feeling  as i have recently reminded others sir i have no feeling  its hard to believe your playing is quite beautiful  strictly speaking sir it is not my playing  it is a precise imitation of jascha heifetz and trenka bronkin  is there nothing of data in what im hearing  you see you chose the violinists  heifetz and bronkin have radically different styles and techniques  yet you combined them successfully  i suppose i have learned to be creative sir  when necessary  mr data i look forward to your next concert
