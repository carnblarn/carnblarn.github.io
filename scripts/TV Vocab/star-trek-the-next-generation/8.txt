                captains log stardate 412556  after delivering earth colonists to the strnab solar system  we have discovered another classm planet in the rubicun star system  we are now in orbit there  it is inhabited and unusually lovely  an away team has gone down to make contact  they are returning to the ship  riker says the planets life forms are almost identical to us   hes enthusiastic  captain sorry troi  the doctor has something important to tell you  youve talked about it for days shore leave for the crew  establishing this colony has been exhausting for the crew  were not a supply vessel  settling all those people has been a strain im tired myself  is it as good as your report suggests  as per report classm earthlike beautiful it will startle you  sounds wonderful for the children  the holodecks are marvelous  but theres nothing like open spaces and fresh air  ive listed my report on their customs and laws  simple commonsense things  theyre wild but also puritanical  theyre neat as pins ultra lawful and make love at the drop of a hat  any hat  but the happiest report has its negatives lets have them  there are none that we could find   but there is a problem here  that faulty reading sir  im reading something off the starboard bow  but there is nothing there  sensor technicians are working on it sir a glitch in the system  i take it you find no glitch at all in this planet however  no sir  if you approve shore leave we could start with a small group  of course wesley lf we go down id like you to join the away team  to evaluate this planet as a place for young people to relax  yes sir  if our scans and observations confirm the report  of course ill approve it  lets just hope its not too good to be true  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  captains log supplemental we are in orbit of rubicun iii  the home of a life form who call themselves the edo  our away team including wesley crusher  has beamed down to make arrangements  concerning some wellearned recreation   careful sir  its alright  those are the edo we met before   they certainly are fit  they certainly are   health and happiness  a pleasant day to you  you did return as promised  rivan liator  also from our vessel troi and  slowly slowly i must welcome this lovely one  nice to see you again  my pleasure  counselor  healthy sensuality sir i feel friendship and happiness  and i welcome this huge one  oh yes  nice planet  yeah  but you are a young one i do not know your love customs  i guess  whatever you usually do  others would like to visit is there a limit on numbers  whatever pleases you well discuss it at the council chambers  shall we go there now or remain in play   play  at love  unless you dont enjoy that  perhaps you do  and you   yes i can see that you do  maybe i should just go on ahead  this is unfair to him well go to the council chambers   there are people your age there  well i cant make any promises  you dont have to our rules are simple  no one does anything uncomfortable to them  come our people will want to know you  rivan perhaps they cant run  cant run of course we can run right commander  thats the custom here running lead the way   when in rome  when in where sir   good health to you  happiness to you  its like an eden here  good health i thought youd be out of breath   we may surprise you  children meet your new friend   well hello join us  yes please   come on  this way  and now you must meet some new friends  everyone weve brought the visitors  please enjoy what we have  ive traced it through our sensor channel sir it is not a glitch  its confirmed by my readings its a shadow something  exactly as if it were neither in or out of our dimension   what is commander  whatever is evading our alarm sir  centre main viewer on that area  i see nothing commander  enterprise to object off our starboard bow identify yourself  shields and deflectors up full sir main phaser banks ready  any reply  it was unintelligible running it through language circuits   geordi have a real look  aye sir  sir my sensors read it its half there  it looks as if it were partly transparent  data what the hell is it   lt la forge to captain  go ahead what can you make out  ive never seen this before sir after a spectral analysis  its as if its not really there  i dont understand it  ive got its first transmission sir it translates as  stand by  sir somethings coming out of that ship  verified sir its very small  what is it  intruder alert sir no location  the away team weve lost contact with our people   the relays do show something  why is everything a something  state the purpose  state the purpose of what you have done  im capt picard commanding this federation starship  state the purpose of your visit here  we have sent down our away team to make peaceful contact here  do you plan to leave life forms here  no we are merely visiting here  but you did more at the world you just left  why have you left your own life forms there  the colony we just planted sir  that world was uninhabited  the life forms we left there had had sought the challenge  at least that is the basic reason  had sought the challenge of creating a new lifestyle  a new society there  life on our world is driven to protect itself  by seeding itself as widely as possible  do not interfere with my children below  captain i do not understand how but it is asking me  if i was constructed for information exchange  if there is any way of finding out whatever it is out there data  watch i bet you cant do this  watch this  i want to do something too with you   what  its something you can teach me   will you  well  actually there are some games i dont quite know yet  its playing ball will you teach me  sure lf you have a bat i can show you my favorite  a bat  a stick or a branch erm about this long this thick  in the gardens come on   this will please you join us  thanks another time   joy and happiness  it certainly is   the good life worf  i am not concerned with pleasure   i am a warrior  even klingons need love  for love sir i would need a klingon woman  what about plain old basic sex no need for that  of course but with the females available to me earth females  i must restrain myself too much  they are quite fragile sir  worf if anyone else said that id suspect he was bragging   bragging sir  ill pass on that  id better check in enterprise come in  captain do you read me  lets  this may be nothing but lets move our people together  including wesley the boy hes outside   is there a problem  weve lost contact with our ship  its nothing these people have done im certain their minds are open  help me locate wes hes wandered off  that is extraordinary   one moment lieutenant  yes but youve got to hear this  youre saying theres no crime here no one breaks any laws  once long long ago there was much disorder but not now  but i see no sign of police   those who enforce laws  we have very few  mediators they are needed only in one place each day  the punishment zone a selected area  a completely random selection  only our mediators know where or for how long  were proud of the wisdom of our ancestors  no one knows where or when a zone will be   and so no one risks death  death  by breaking any law   explain this  only one punishment for any crime  anyone who commits any crime in the punishment zone dies  the law is the law our peace is built on that  even for ignoring a rule like keep off the grass  then no one breaks that rule who would risk execution  a white wall or fence reminds anyone of a forbidden area  and just who tells visitors about these rules  wed better find wesley  here alright over here  yeah go back alright  youre very clever at this  at home we play a lot toss the ball ahead of me   no  its forbidden to disturb plants  couldnt you see the fence dont ever go past a white marker  its ok   im fine  no please no   speak the truth we are mediators  i said i was fine   he doesnt know  how very sad   this zone has been selected  but he doesnt understand  its always sad now doubly so  i was chasing a ball and i fell into that im really sorry   you admit you did that freely  im with starfleet we dont lie  it wont happen again we apologize  were sorry too but that changes nothing  careful theyve got some strange laws here   you reviewed their laws  there was nothing about punishment  one moment is there a witness to this transgression  it was my fault i threw the ball past him  we have a visible transgression witnesses and an admission of guilt  though it pains us deeply to do it we must   are you prepared for punishment  punishment  if you mean what they told us about   what punishment  death dont make it difficult  drop it  drop it now  its a kind of syringe  what is this is this poison  of course completely painless the boy would have felt nothing   now youve frightened him  he was going to kill me  and if this zone was still in effect you would all die  they said you came as friends is this how friends act  enterprise from away team come in  are you receiving us enterprise   condition  no sign of consciousness  but the readings are normal for him  this must be some form of information exchange with whatever is out there   i hope it is  any news from the away team  somethings blocking communication  security urgent enterprise from away team   lieutenant were receiving you  urgent call for capt picard  we have serious trouble with a member of the team  and an unusual law they have here  riker stand by any signs of consciousness  no it may be minutes or hours its unclear whats happened to him  take him to sickbay anything new on that thing over there  negative sir  captain to first officer im beaming down  would you care to comment privately on how you read any of this  unnecessary these people are honest almost to a fault  and they have great pride in their ways  youre the captain were ready this way please   welcome to our world captain  thank you  we regret that our system of justice is troubling you  the boy wesley crusher where is he please  ive allowed them to hold him pending the outcome of this  he is safe and unharmed we promise that  captain i do not know how you earth people conduct law and justice  even if you respect such things   we do  good so do we  our precepts have been handed down from long ago  the tranquility you see has been made possible by our laws  we are a people of law they sometimes bring us sadness  but we have adjusted to that perhaps your laws work as well  they havent always now they do   do you execute criminals  no not any longer   but you did once  unfortunately but since then  but when you did was it believed necessary to do so  some people felt so now we detect the seeds of criminal behavior  capital punishment is no longer considered a justifiable deterrent  so we are not yet as advanced as they are  and since you are advanced in other ways  i suggest you use your superior powers to rescue the wesley boy  we will record him as a convicted criminal an advanced person  who luckily escaped the barbarism of this backward little world  unfortunately we have a law known as the prime directive  riker has explained it  is the boy in any danger from you at this moment  until sundown  because you are strangers we are delaying enforcement of the law  but we must act by sundown  then i have another question while orbiting  while circling high above your world as we do  we have encountered a strange object a vessel perhaps  have you any idea what it is its not entirely real  at least its not completely solid   do you mean god  god  god is said to be somewhere up there protecting us  exactly how would you describe god  as you just did as existing both here and in another place also  but when god wants to show its power  it can make itself felt most fully  captain come in please   picard here  cmo crusher sir  cmdr data has regained consciousness   what condition can he talk  he insists on it sir urgently  stand by picard out  i want to speak to her personally about her son  you promise that wesley crusher is safe until sundown  you have our word  then will one of you return with me to our ship  of course ill go as a hostage for the boys safety  no i want you to identify something for me if you can  transporter room three to beam up   im frightened  theres no reason to be  transporter room energize  but this is a city a great city   captain whats this about wesley  in a moment doctor   in a moment  exactly in a moment  you were about to say  with such power why be concerned about our laws  you could take the boy from us  its not that simple  from the starboard lounge you can see whatever is outside this vessel  you mean my world were high above it  and something else circling your world  its important to us and perhaps to you to know what it is  im sorry but it was necessary do you know what that is   can you tell us what it is  is it god  its very important that you answer something  how do you recognize what it is  nothing will harm you i promise just tell us how you recognize it  it has appeared before  can you speak to it does it speak to you  captain  return my child   return  its coming towards us  picard to transporter room come in   yes but hurry  its still coming towards us  transporter chief to captain  one to beam down to away team location hurry engage  urgent engage  it seems the edos god is very protective of its children  i had no choice but to learn about that thing from her  im sorry i had to she was so frightened  its understandable orbiting with god is no small experience  lets go see your patient doctor  what do you intend to do about my son  hes being held safely until sundown  when he faces execution  hes committed no crime any sane and reasonable person  you saw what that thing was about to do  i apologize sir but this is very difficult for me  if he were your son youd be as frightened  but i am  datas in sickbay here youll find him able to talk to you   hes checking out fine  thank you finish it later please  i was an excellent choice they were able to communicate quite  i was about to say easily but there was nothing easy about it  they were about to overload my circuitry  you say they so it is a vessel of some sort  its not a single entity sir they know the edo worship them as a god  they know  they recognize it is expected at the edo stage of evolution  what sort of vessel  its perhaps not what we would call a vessel sir  the dimensions it occupies allow them to be in several places at once  they consider this entire star cluster is theirs  it was probably unwise of us to place a human colony in this area  of course there are 3004 other planets we could colonize   the largest  data dont babble  babble sir im not aware that i ever babble sir  i sometimes have considerable information to communicate  and you may question the way i organize it  please organize it into brief answers to my questions  we have little time  do they accept our presence at this planet  undecided sir  data please feel free to volunteer any important information  i volunteer that they are now observing us sir   to judge what we are like  no it is more curiosity  i doubt that they expect us to abide by their value systems   do they know our prime directive  they know everything i know sir  and if we were to violate the prime directive   thats not a fair question  how would they react  they would judge us by our own rules sir  if we violate our own prime directive  they might consider us to be deceitful and untrustworthy  they did caution us not to interfere with their children below   what has happened  the edo want to execute my son   i will not allow that to happen  most interesting sir  the emotion of motherhood as compared to others  shut up  you were right sir i do tend to babble  captains log stardate 412559  whatever the object in orbit with us it hangs there like a nemesis  it is one thing to communicate with something mysterious  but quite another to be silently observed by it  i am concerned whether it understands the same concept of reason we do  you sent for me sir  lets have more talk data  yes sir  sit down  what level of communication sir  any my apologies for saying that you babbled  but i do sir  you also see things as we do not but as they truly are  i need help my friend  i cannot permit that boy or anyone from this vessel to be sacrificed  the prime directive never intended that  the problem is there theyve learned of the prime directive from my mind  but how will they evaluate it  how do they reason what are their values   remember their warning to us  exactly  how do i explain my refusing to obey their laws  not permitting the crusher boy  to be executed and by so doing do i endanger this vessel  and a thousand other lives  would you choose one life over one thousand sir  i refuse to let arithmetic decide questions like that  did you learn of the relationship between that and the edo  why are they so certain its a god  any sufficiently advanced life form appears as that to others sir  but when they were probing my thoughts  i could feel that they once existed in this dimension just as we do  perhaps in the same fleshandblood form  since then however they have evolved considerably  their present existence no doubt has advantages we do not understand  in some earlier fleshandblood form they might have shared our values  we know the edo share them  why would such an advanced thing feel obliged to protect the edo  perhaps the edo are a child race by comparison  possibly a race which those life forms have planted here  much as we now plant human colonies on classm planets  having fulfilled my professional obligations regarding cmdr data  you now request permission to beam down to the planet granted  you can accompany me while i try and resolve this  know that whatever the cost i will not allow them to execute your son  thank you sir   data take command  aye sir  its almost time i want the boy brought here now   ill go with you  of course  captain picard  i saw you share the sky with god you must be gods  no we are not gods  mother  i guess you know a lot has happened here  i know  captain picard  are you going to let them kill me  no but i must find some way to prevent it that you understand  how can we let this happen liator they threaten everything we respect  our law our peace our tranquility and order  you are powerful but do not do this to us we beg you  at least study what we were without law hurtful savage thieving  i understand  perhaps your system of law is better than any system we once had  but we do now have a law i must obey  part of it says i must protect my people from harm  we did not ask you to come here  it has to do with another law that we must obey  we are all sworn not to interfere with other lives in the galaxy  if i save this boy i break that law  and should be executed if you do  i may suffer almost as much  starfleet takes the prime directive seriously  no it is god who will punish you  that has crossed our minds your god up there may insist  that we obey our noninterference directive  sir does this mean if you save me then the entire crew could die  youre not involved in this decision boy  im sorry sir but it seems like i am  picard to transporter room stand by for six to beam up  wesley lieutenant  our laws have been violated what of justice  what of justice to wesley does he deserve to die  im truly sorry but i must have justice for my people too  transporter room energize   transporter room come in  we cant energize the beam sir  god has prevented your escape  then god is unfair my son had no warning of your laws  we cannot allow ignorance of the law to become a defense  i dont know how to communicate this or even if its possible  the question of justice has concerned me greatly of late  i say to any creature listening there can be no justice  so long as laws are absolute  even life itself is an exercise in exceptions  when has justice ever been as simple as a rule book  seems the edo lord agrees with you number one  main viewer on   hailing frequencies  open sir  to the object in orbit with us  we will remove the human colonists from the adjoining solar system  if you signal us to do so please tell us  captain   is that a signal  i suppose  i suppose it must be i was hoping for more  more of what sir im glad its gone  agreed sir short and sweet godlike efficiency  i was hoping we might learn more about it  but since we cant take us out of here number one  gladly sir
