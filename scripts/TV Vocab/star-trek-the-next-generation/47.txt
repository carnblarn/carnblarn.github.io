                there you are   whats wrong  something jabbed me in the calf  obrien cmdr rikers injured bring him up  stand by   geordi  its just a scratch right sorry  were the first team on this planet we dont know what the risks are  obrien whats the holdup  the transporter shows unidentified microbes in cmdr riker   cant the biofilter screen em out  no dr pulaski has been notified   acknowledged  i wasnt ready to leave anyway  heres the biofilter analysis of the microbes  not much to go on  i can override and beam cmdr riker aboard  no id better go down and make an evaluation there  i hope these are the right coordinates  just kidding i know you love the transporter  about as much as i love comical transporter chiefs  ready  over here doctor  fill me in  i was walking along doing a simple geological sweep  something stuck me in the leg   any pain  no its just a little numb   do you know what stuck you  weve looked no luck  whatever it is it left something behind ill take you up to sickbay  obrien this is dr pulaski medical override is authorized  acknowledged  this is the strangest feeling my leg just went dead  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  captains log stardate 429761  during a survey on surata iv  cmdr riker has become infected by an unidentified microbe   number one  captain  put your foot where it didnt belong  the doctor was bored so i gave her a challenge  that you did  cmdr rikers nervous system has been invaded by an unknown microorganism  not a bacteria not a virus but with elements of both  theres the point of entry  the microbes are infecting the great sciatic nerve  and they are multiplying at an incredible rate there   can you remove it  not surgically  the organisms fuse to the nerve intertwining at the molecular level  thats why the transporters biofilters couldnt extract it  theres no evidence of nerve damage  but the organisms are impeding nervous function   my legs still asleep  prognosis  the infection is spreading it will eventually reach the brain  and if it interfered with neural activity  cmdr riker could die  how can i help  i need to know more about its composition   for that you need a sample  exactly  cmdr data mr la forge prepare to beam down to the planet  aye sir  i must reiterate it would be better if i went alone  dont like my company  your company is not at issue your vulnerability is  ill watch my step besides this bug may prefer androids to humans  possible but highly unlikely in any event why risk both of us  because i know where he was when it happened  mr obrien  energize  he was right over here  i am detecting no animal life forms within 50 kilometers  however i am reading extensive animal remains mostly fossilized  a graveyard  i do not know  look at this  the structure is rhizomatous   careful  im always careful  it appears to be dead  im not so sure im seeing thermal variations  let it go lets try something maybe it likes humans over androids  if so you could be placing yourself in danger  i know im counting on those great android reflexes of yours  that must be what were looking for  i tend to agree  stand by obrien  got it energize  thanks obrien another minute and wed have been fossils too  not precisely true fossilization requires several millennia   heres your sample  get it to sickbay right away  report  captain cmdr rikers injury was not accidental  certain vines seek warmblooded beings and deliberately infect them  to what end  unknown sir there might be a symbiotic relationship involved  go on  there are many animal remains around  leading me to hypothesize that the vines could be predatory  vines infect animals in order to kill them  it is possible  for cmdr rikers sake i hope my hypothesis is in error  unfortunately cmdr data your hypotheses rarely are  all negative  is there nothing to cure this infection  this microorganism is very mysterious  i cant even figure out whats keeping it alive   or how to kill it  i can kill it  but not without destroying the nerves its inhabiting  i know youre doing your best  my best may not be good enough  comfortable  why wouldnt i be they wait on me hand and foot  i just hope they dont find out that im faking it  i wish you were faking it   ive seen the thorn  yes so have i it looks harmless  and deadly  im sorry  well these things happen  when least expected  im surprised they dont happen more often we are exploring the unknown  and the unknown can be benign  or malevolent  one of the things ive learned on these voyages and from you  is that most life forms act out of an instinct for survival not malice  its an important lesson  and i admire your lack of resentment number one  if you drop a hammer on your foot  theres no use getting mad at the hammer   anything  not yet  what can i do  you can get out of my hair  aye aye doctor  the bug is persistent i admit  but im not worried we rikers are ornery too  my greatgrandfather once got bit by a rattlesnake  after three days of intense pain the snake died  youre a very entertaining patient  i try   youre trying hard to be cheerful  you of all people should know  you feel what anyone in your position would feel  as the first officer on this ship i have to set an example   even now  now more than ever  deanna facing death is the ultimate test of character  i dont want to die but if i have to i hope to do it with some pride  and a lot of impudence  you bet  dyings bad enough but to lose my sense of humour forget it  imzadi  i havent given up yet  its spread to the spinal column  its weakening his autonomic nervous system  judging by its present rate of growth and its infiltration pattern  the infection will spread to the brain within an hour  medical log stardate 429763  i cant keep the alien infection from spreading to rikers brain  once there it will kill him by dampening neural impulses  i can only keep him alive by forcing the neurons to stay active  by stimulating them directly with electrical impulses  lets proceed  good  stand by with five milligrams of tricordrazine in case of seizure  here goes  anybody  we have stimulated random activity but the patterns are erratic  hang on will hang on  the wave patterns are still too irregular  why wont they stabilize  wait ive found the right amplitude  there  the patterns are steadier  is it preventing the infection from taking hold  for now  the vertex waves show a kcomplex corresponding to an rem state  hes dreaming  hello  marvellous how easily humans do that  i still need much practice  there are some puzzles down on  the planet that the captain wants answered  he suggests you for my away team  i shall endeavour to function adequately  yes  when the captain suggested you i looked up your record  a wise procedure  your rank of lieutenant commander is honorary  starfleet class of 78 honours in probability mechanics and exobiology   but the file says youre a  machine does that trouble you  to be honest yes  understood sir prejudice is very human  that troubles me do you consider yourself superior  i am superior in many ways but id gladly give it up to be human  nice to meet you  pinocchio  a joke  intriguing  youll be an interesting companion  what should i say how do i act what do i do  guinan i need your help step over here  sounds simple enough  now first words are important you may want to start like this  you are the most beautiful woman in the galaxy  but that might not work  yes it would  ive so wanted to say that   but you were afraid  yes   of me  of us what we might become  commander   that you might think it was a line  maybe i do think its a line   you think im not sincere  i didnt say that  whats wrong with a line its like a knock at the door   youre inviting me in  im not sending you away   its more than i expected  is it what you hoped  to hope is to recognize the possibility i had only dreams   dreams can be dangerous  not these  i dream of a galaxy where your eyes are the stars  and the universe worships the night  careful putting me up so high you may not be able to reach me  then ill learn how to fly  youre the heart in my day and the soul in my night  this isnt my style  shut up kid  tell me more about my eyes  i couldnt go without saying goodbye  i dont like goodbyes how about until next time  how about until next time  its been a pleasure working with you commander  the feeling is mutual  counsellor  im supposed to know how everyone feels but  i cant read you right now  perhaps your own feelings are getting in the way  my job is to help others with their emotions  my own feelings are beside the point  not to me our feelings are what make us all human  are you feeling sad  yes i am  so am i  hes relaxed  experiencing feelings of warmth and friendship  hes reliving memories its a side effect of neural stimulation  look at this the organisms metabolism has changed  perhaps the stimulation is affecting them  im going to refocus the impulse pattern on the interpretative cortex   to intensify his memories  exactly  well see if that affects the microbes  everyone weve brought the visitors  please enjoy what we have  gentlemen if this is what you call enhancement   youve got a gift for understatement  whats a knockout like you  doing in a computergenerated gin joint like this   waiting for you  waiting for me   you cant be serious  yes will  ive never been more serious in my life  something wrong  no its just that cmdr rikers emotions are rather passionate   as in erotic  very much so  a dream is that what this is is that what i am  i know youre a computergenerated image but  your smell  your touch the way you feel   even the things you say and think seem so real  thank you  how far can this relationship go  i mean how real are you  as real as you need me to be  you resist dont you find me attractive  yes i find you very attractive  you attract me like no man has  its not my function to seduce or be seduced  by the leader of another world   its not the reason  no  but will you still respect me tomorrow  i hope so   william is something wrong  what do you mean  do you not like girls  of course i do  is there a special technique to this foot washing  you generally start at the top and work your way down  i think i can handle that  i was hoping you might  the organisms responded alright their growth rate has doubled  then all weve done is make things worse  so the growth rate is related to the memories hes experiencing  or the emotions they produce  different mental processes generate different chemicals  perhaps the organisms are sensitive to brain endorphins  so if some types of endorphins attract them  others will repel them  ill change the differential current patterns see what happens   were not going without our crew  i warn you  people need attention we wont hurt you but we must help them  number one  the creature attacked yar is down   it feeds on phaser energy  we had no effect on it  whats lt yars condition   dr crusher report  shes dead  im losing life signs  you must save him  im sorry  growth rate has definitely slowed what is he feeling can you tell  sadness  which is the opposite of before  with the opposite effect on the infection  then your theorys correct  the organisms are sensitive to different types of endorphins   and negative emotions  such as sadness  produce endorphins that inhibit the organisms growth  then we can repel the infection   assuming were not too late  how much time do we have  im not sure his vital signs are getting weaker  i cant risk another dose of tricordrazine unless i have to  i must refocus the pattern again  we need to isolate memories that generate stronger negative emotions  i know i can count on every klingon warrior in this crew  to serve and die in that battle  so i ask you again cmdr riker where are your loyalties  ive been assigned to serve this ship and to obey your orders  and i will do exactly that   youll take an oath to that effect  i just did  this is your second officer lt klag  is there something you wanted to say  yes sir  i do not believe you  you challenge my authority over you  correct  and your position on this captain  i would say it is your first command decision  ready for your tour admiral  quite ready commander   whats in the case  i brought it for dr crusher  perhaps you would like to see it   what is it  a form of life  it was discovered accidentally by a survey team on an uncharted planet   why havent we heard about it  you will do shortly  first there remains scientific study to be done   it is a superior form of life  superior   totally come have a look  ill summon my science officer  it wont like your science officer it does like you  vitamins they do wonders for the body  riker to security guest quarters 17 emergency  weve reduced the growth but not enough  his vital signs are deteriorating  but weve isolated the specific areas to stimulate  the feelings were primal  survival emotions  they must produce an endorphin that poisons the organisms  cant you intensify that emotion  i can refocus the impulse pattern even tighter  i dont know if he can withstand it hes extremely weak  do we have a choice  no  if we dont neutralize the infection within half an hour hell be dead  medical log supplemental  cmdr rikers condition is still critical  ive discovered a way to reverse the infections growth  but i may be too late  hes getting weaker isnt he  respiration shallow heartbeat irregular but we cant delay  take us home and leave us with our medicine or he dies  dont you see i have no choice we were sent to bring felicium back  the suffering on my planet is too great people are dying  whether we are entitled to it or not we must have it  let him go  you will take us there now or give us a shuttle  but we must have the medicine   if you refuse this man will die  i will not be coerced  i will do it i will kill him  who are you  data somethings got me   touch him and he dies  no dont  enterprise   armus has enveloped cmdr riker  im beaming you up  if any of you leave now he dies  and so do the survivors of the crash  the growth rates down to seven percent  the organisms are still impairing his neural functions  respiration erratic pulse irregular  blood pressure almost nil tricordrazine  can we tighten the pattern further  recognize picard jeanluc captain  recognize riker william t commander  set autodestruct sequence  does the first officer concur  yes set autodestruct sequence now  autodestruct will detonate in four minutes and 59 seconds   i am korris  well handle the formalities later  right now we have to get off this ship any other survivors  no   i have found a quicker way out  check him out  he is alive but barely   then pick up the body and lets go  no   i will carry him  as you wish  cmon lets go  tasha go to transporter room three   i want you there when they return  aye sir  commander this ship is blowing  transporter room have you got us  too much interference get away from the engineering section  the engineering sections critical destruction is imminent  there are no options do it now  the growth rates almost at zero  thats not good enough  we seek peaceful coexistence  set autodestruct  data somethings got me  autodestruct  now  data somethings got me   sickbay to bridge  yes doctor  weve eradicated the infection  im on my way  youre still here  i could ask you the same question  how do you feel  beat  you wouldnt believe my dreams  yes we would  youll be pleased to hear weve terminated the infection  great work doctor now if i can get out of here ill return to  lie still i still have a few dozen tests to run   why i feel fine  there may be residual memory loss  i want to be certain you still know who you are  of course i know who i am  im capt jeanluc picard of the uss enterprise  im delighted youre feeling better  captain  the admiral and i were worried about you  captain you do not have the authority to promote me to admiral
