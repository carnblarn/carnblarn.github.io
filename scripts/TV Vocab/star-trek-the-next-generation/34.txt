                captains log stardate 425237  we are en route to the new starbase 173 for port call  crew rotation is scheduled  and we will offload experiment modules  thats my chair my luck is lousy unless i start on the dealers right   that seems to be superstition  experience teaches me its a truth  the game is fivecard stud nothing wild ante up  this game is very simple  with only 52 cards  and five players there are limited winning combinations  theres more to this than the cards  of course the bets indicate the strength of each hand  time to pluck a pigeon  five  im in  l too  call  a seven and a six the ace   i bet ten  see that  call  fold  yeah me too im out  i bet five  same  your five and five  too rich for me  no help  i bet ten  your ten and ten  is that what is known as a poker face  playing or not  i fold   you had nothing  he bluffed you data  it makes little sense to bet if you cannot win  i did win i was betting that you wouldnt call   how could you tell  instinct data  the game is seven card highlow with a buy on the last card  and just to add interest the man with the axe takes all  my god  phillipa louvois and back in uniform  its been ten years but seeing you again like this makes it seem 50  if we were alone know what id like to do   bust a chair across my teeth  after that  aint love wonderful  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  so  what are you doing out here  i am in charge of the 23rd sector jag office were brand new  i have no staff but one terrified little ensign  hopefully we can make some good law here  anything is possible so you came back to starfleet  the most worthwhile place to be   you had no reason to leave  they forced me out  no that was your own damn stubborn pride  when i prosecuted you in the court martial i was doing my job  you did more than that you enjoyed it  not true a court martial is standard procedure when a ship is lost  it was my duty as a judge advocate general  you enjoy the adversarial process more than getting at the truth  i hope youve learned a little wisdom along the way  you know i never thought i would say this   but its good to see you again  it brings a sense of order and stability to my universe  to know that youre still a pompous ass  and a damn sexy man  capt picard   admiral  capt louvois you know capt picard  yes were old friends excuse me  picard call me you can buy me dinner  captain good to see you again   may i introduce cmdr bruce maddox  commander  he has an interesting proposal  but it can wait im eager to see the enterprise  yes sir this way  admiral on the bridge  im surprised at the decision to put a base so close to the neutral zone  weve had disturbing news from both sides of the zone  were here to respond when needed  and it wont hurt to have the romulans know that were nearby  i thank you for this opportunity  for 500 years every vessel named enterprise has become a legend  this one is no different  admiral  yes captain cmdr maddox is here to work on your android  please take care of him  how have you been data  my condition does not alter with time commander  you two are acquainted  i evaluated data when it applied to the academy  and was the sole committee member to oppose my entrance  because i was not a sentient being  what exactly will this work entail  i am going to disassemble data  alright explain this procedure  ever since i saw data at the entrance evaluation at starfleet academy  ive wanted to understand it  i became a student of the works of dr noonien soong datas creator  and ive tried to continue his work  i believe i am close to a breakthrough  that will enable me to duplicate dr soongs work  and replicate this  but as a first step i must disassemble and study it  data is going to be my guide  it sounds intriguing   how will you proceed  ill run a full diagnostic on data  evaluate its current software  then dump its core memory into the starbase computer  and begin a detailed analysis of its construction  youve constructed a positronic brain  yes  you know how the electron resistance  across the neural filaments can be resolved  not precisely  that would seem a necessary first step  i am confident i will find the answer  once i examine the filament links in your anterior cortex  if the answer is not forthcoming  your model will not function  i do not anticipate any problems  you seem a little vague on specifics  what are the risks to cmdr data  negligible  captain i believe his basic research lacks the specifics necessary  to support an experiment of this magnitude  cmdr data is a valued member of my bridge crew  based on what ive heard  i cannot allow cmdr data to submit himself to this experiment  i was afraid this might be your attitude captain  starfleets transfer orders  separating cmdr data from the enterprise and reassigning it  to starbase 173 under my command  data i will see you in my office tomorrow at 0900 hours  come  you sent for me sir  data please sit down  well we have a problem  i am in complete agreement with that assessment sir  your service to this ship has been exemplary  i dont want to lose you  i will not submit to the procedure sir  i understand your objections  but i have to consider starfleets interests  what if cmdr maddox is correct  that it is possible many more beings like yourself could be constructed  sir lt la forges eyes are far superior to human eyes true  then why are not all human officers required  to have their eyes replaced with cybernetic implants  i see  it is precisely because i am not human  that will be all mr data  computer pull all relevant information  regarding starfleet regulations on the transfer of officers  working  my god twice in as many days   i need your help  an historic moment  i have tried to make sense of this gobbledegook  but its beyond me the fact is my android officer data  is being transferred compulsorily to be part of a dangerous  illconceived experiment i want it stopped  he can refuse to undergo the procedure but not the transfer  once this maddox has got control of data  anything could happen i dont trust that man  we agree to certain risks when we join starfleet  yes acceptable risks justified risks  but i cant accept this its unfair he has rights  all this passion over a machine  dont start  this is important to me  is there an option  there is always an option  he can resign  i see  so you came to me for help  yes i came to you youre the jag officer for this sector   i had no choice but to come to you  wait  i didnt mean it that way  im glad you felt you could well come to me  the word trust just isnt in your vocabulary is it   good try top marks for effort  i wish things were different  i wish i could believe that  when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes  i all alone be weep my outcast state  is it just words to you or do you fathom the meaning  is it not customary to ask permission to enter an individuals quarters  i thought that we could talk that i could try to persuade you  your memories and knowledge will remain intact  reduced to the mere facts of the events  the substance the flavour of the moment could be lost  take games of chance   games of chance  yes  i had read and absorbed every treatise and book on the subject  i was well prepared for the experience  yet when i finally played poker  i discovered that the reality bore little resemblance to the rules  and the point being  i believe it is possible to download information from a positronic brain  but i do not believe you can preserve the essence of those experiences  there is an ineffable quality to memory  which i do not believe can survive your procedure  ineffable quality  i had rather we had done this together  but one way or the other we are doing it you are under my command  no sir i am not under yours nor anyone elses command   i have resigned from starfleet  resigned  you cant resign  i regret the decision but i must  i am the culmination of one mans dream  this is not ego or vanity but when dr soong created me  he added to the substance of the universe  lf by your experiments i am destroyed  something unique something wonderful will be lost  i cannot permit that  i must protect his dream  and so must i  but keep packing because one way or the other you will be reporting  captains log supplemental  cmdr bruce maddox thwarted by datas abrupt resignation  is now seeking a legal remedy for his woes  capt louvois has requested my presence at those discussions  your response is emotional and irrational  you endow data with human attributes because it looks human it is not  if it were a box on wheels i would not face this opposition  overt sentimentality is not one of capt picards failings trust me  i will tell you again data is a valued member of my crew  an outstanding bridge officer  if i am permitted to make this experiment  our horizons become boundless  consider every ship in starfleet with a data on board  utilizing its extraordinary capabilities  our hands and eyes in dangerous situations  youre preaching to the choir here get to the point  data must not be allowed to resign  data is a starfleet officer with certain rights  im sick to death of hearing about rights  what about my right not to have my lifes work subverted by ignorance  we have laws you cannot experiment with people to prove your theories   thank you  now youre doing it  data is an extraordinary piece of engineering but it is a machine  if you permit it to resign it will destroy years of work in robotics  starfleet need not allow the resignation  commander who do you think you work for  starfleet does not ignore its own regulations  when they become inconvenient like it or not data does have rights  let me put it another way  would you permit the enterprise computer to refuse a refit  thats an interesting point but the computer is property   is data  of course  there may be law to support this  then find it a ruling with such broad implications must be supported  i hope you will use the same zeal  that you did in the stargazer court martial  data youre supposed to rip the wrapping off  with the application of a little care wes  the paper can be utilized again  youre missing the point  the dream of the fire by kratak thank you worf  with the klingons the novel attained its full stature  i couldnt disagree more well save that argument for another day  excuse me please  is something wrong  of course there is youre going away  no one regrets that necessity more than i  you do understand my reasons  sure i understand  i just dont like you being forced out its not fair  as dr pulaski would no doubt remind us life is rarely fair  sorry that doesnt make it any better  i shall miss you geordi  me too  take care of yourself data  i have completed my research  based on the acts of cumberland passed in the early 21st century  data is the property of starfleet  he cannot resign or refuse to cooperate with cmdr maddox   what if i challenge this ruling  then we must hold a hearing   i so challenge convene a hearing  captain that would be difficult  this is a new base i have no staff  but surely you have regulations to take care of such an eventuality  there are i can use serving officers as legal counsel  you as senior officer would defend  very good  the unenviable task of prosecuting would be yours commander  as the next most senior officer on the ship  i cant i wont data is my comrade we have served together  i not only respect him i consider him my friend  when people of good conscience have an honest dispute  we must still sometimes resort to such an adversarial system  you want me to prove data is a mere machine i cant i dont believe it  i know better im neither qualified nor willing  youll have to find someone else  then i rule summarily based on my findings  data is a toaster have him report to cmdr maddox for experimental refit  i see i have no choice but to agree  good and i expect you to do your duty in court  if i find you are not doing your best i will end this then and there  you dont have to remind us of our duty  you just  remember yours  i have never forgotten it  not then and certainly not now  come  data capt louvois has issued a ruling  you are the property of starfleet command you cannot resign  i see from limitless options i am reduced to none  or rather one i hope cmdr maddox is more capable than it appears  data you not going to submit were going to fight this  i challenged the ruling capt louvois will be compelled to hold a hearing  she may be overly attached to the letter of the law  but i suspect she still understands its spirit  we will put to rest any question of your legal status once and for all  i have been asked to represent you but if you prefer another officer  captain i have complete confidence in your ability to represent me  computer identify riker william t  access code theta alpha 2737 blue enable  riker william t identified ready  access all available technical schematics  on lt cmdr data  working  this hearing convened on stardate 425274  is to determine the legal status of the android data  the judge advocate general has rendered a finding of property  the defence has challenged cmdr riker  your honour there is one issue one relevant piece of evidence  i call lt cmdr data  verify lt cmdr data  current assignment uss enterprise   starfleet command decoration  well stipulate to all of this  objection your honour  i want this read all of it  sustained   valour and gallantry medal of honour with clusters  legion of honour the star cross  proceed commander   commander what are you  an android  which is  websters 24th century dictionary fifth edition defines an android  as an automaton made to resemble a human being  automaton made by whom   sir  who built you commander  dr noonian soong   he was  the foremost cybernetics authority  more basic than that what was he  human  thank you  what is your memory capacity and how fast can you access information  i have an ultimate storage capacity is 800 quadrillion bits  my total linear speed has been rated at 60 trillion operations per second  your honour i offer prosecutions exhibit a a rod of parsteel  tensile strength 40 kilobars   commander can you bend that  objection  many life forms possess megastrength this is not relevant  i cant agree captain proceed with your demonstration  drawing on the construction log of the prototype android lore  also made by noonian soong i request to be allowed  to remove datas hand for inspection  objection  it doesnt matter  objection withdrawn  proceed commander  im sorry  the commander is a physical representation of a dream  an idea conceived of by the mind of a man  its purpose is to serve human needs and interests  its a collection of neural nets and heuristic algorithms  its response is dictated by elaborate software written by a man  its hardware built by a man and now  now a man will shut it off  pinocchio is broken its strings have been cut  i request a recess  granted  do you mean his argument was that good  his presentation was devastating he almost convinced me  youve got the harder argument  by his own admission data is a machine  thats true  youre worried about what will happen to him  ive had to send people on far more dangerous missions  then this should work out fine  maddox could get lucky and create an army of datas all very valuable   yes no doubt  hes proved his value to you  in ways that i cannot even begin to calculate  and now hes about to be ruled the property of starfleet  that should increase his value  in what way  in the history of many worlds  there have always been disposable creatures  they do the dirty work  work that no one else wants to do because its too hard too hazardous  with an army of datas all disposable  you dont have to think about their welfare or about how they feel  whole generations of disposable people  youre talking about slavery  i think thats a little harsh  i dont think thats harsh i think thats the truth  a truth that we have obscured behind  a comfortable easy euphemism  property  but thats not the issue at all is it  cmdr riker has dramatically demonstrated to this court  that lt cmdr data is a machine  do we deny that no because it is not relevant  we too are machines just machines of a different type  cmdr riker has also reminded us  that lt cmdr data was created by a human  do we deny that no again it is not relevant  children are made from the building blocks of their parents dna  are they property  i call lt cmdr data to the stand   what are these  my medals  why do you pack them what purpose have they  i do not know sir i suppose none  i just wanted them is that vanity   and this  a gift from you sir  you value it   yes sir  why  it is a reminder of friendship and service  and this you have no other portraits of crew members  why this person  i would prefer not to answer that question sir i gave my word  in the circumstances i dont think tasha would mind  she was special to me sir  we were  intimate  thank you commander i have no further questions for this witness  cmdr riker do you want to cross  i have no questions your honour  thank you you may step down  i call to the stand cmdr bruce maddox as a hostile witness  verify maddox bruce commander  current assignment associate chair of robotics technological institute   major papers  yes hes an expert commander  is your contention that lt cmdr data is not a sentient being  and thus not entitled to all the rights  reserved for all life forms in this federation  data is not sentient no  would you enlighten us what is required for sentience  intelligence selfawareness consciousness  prove to the court i am sentient  this is absurd we all know youre sentient  so i am sentient but cmdr data is not   thats right  why   why am i sentient  well you are selfaware  thats your second criterion  lets deal with the first intelligence   is cmdr data intelligent  yes  it has the ability to learn and understand and to   cope with new situations  like this hearing  yes  what about selfawareness what does it mean why am i selfaware  because you are conscious of your existence and actions  you are aware of yourself and your own ego  cmdr data what are you doing now  taking part in a hearing to determine my rights and status   am i a person or property  and whats at stake  my right to choose perhaps my very life  my rights  my status my right to choose  my life  it seems reasonably selfaware to me  commander  im waiting  this is exceedingly difficult  do you like cmdr data  i dont know it well enough to like or dislike it   but you admire him  yes   it is an extraordinary piece of  engineering programming you said  you have devoted your life to the study of cybernetics  yes   and cmdr data in particular  yes   now you propose to dismantle him  to learn from it and make more   how many more  as many as are needed  hundreds thousands if necessary  there is no limit  a single data  and forgive me commander  is a curiosity  a wonder even but thousands of datas  isnt that becoming  a race  and wont we be judged by how we treat that race  now tell me commander what is data   i dont understand  what is he   a machine  are you sure   yes  he met two criteria for sentience  what if he met the third consciousness what is he then  i dont know do you  thats the question you have to answer  a courtroom is a crucible where we burn away irrelevancies  until we are left with a pure product truth for all time  sooner or later this man or others like him  will succeed in replicating cmdr data  the decision you reach today will determine how we will regard this  creation of our genius  it will reveal what people are what he is destined to be  it will reach beyond this courtroom and this one android  it could redefine the boundaries of personal liberty and freedom  expanding them for some  savagely curtailing them for others  are you prepared to condemn him and all who come after to slavery  your honour starfleet was founded to seek out new life  well there it sits  waiting  you wanted a chance to make law here it is make it a good one  it sits there looking at me and i dont know what it is  this case has dealt with metaphysics  with questions best left to saints and philosophers  i am neither competent nor qualified to answer those  ive got to make a ruling  to try to speak to the future  is data a machine yes  is he the property of starfleet  no  we have all been dancing around the basic issue  does data have a soul  i dont know that he has i dont know that i have  but i must give him the freedom to explore that question himself  it is the ruling of this court  that lt cmdr data has the freedom to choose  i formally refuse to undergo your procedure  i will cancel the transfer order  thank you  and commander continue your work  when you are ready i will still be here  i find some of what you propose  intriguing  hes remarkable  you didnt call him it  you see sometimes it does work   dinner  are you buying  sir there is a celebration on the holodeck  i have no right to be there   because you failed in your task  god no i was that close to a win   yes sir  i almost cost you your life  is it not true that had you refused to prosecute  capt louvois would have ruled against me  yes  that action injured you  and saved me  i will not forget it  youre a wise man my friend  not yet sir but with your help i am learning
