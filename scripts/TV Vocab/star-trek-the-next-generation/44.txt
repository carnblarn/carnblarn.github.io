                captains log stardate 428592  were in orbit around antede iii awaiting two dignitaries  our mission is to escort them to a conference on pacifica  where they will have the chance to join the federation  you may find this interesting mr crusher  few humans have seen an antedean in the flesh  welcome im jeanluc picard  captain of the enterprise   are they alright sir  yes  this is their preferred way of space travel  their physical condition is good  considering the circumstances  it is a selfinduced catatonic state  their way of dealing with the trauma of space flight   will we try to revive them  no  not until we reach the conference three days from now  have you prepared a sickbay facility for our guests  it needs some adjustments  their physiology is unusual you can store them for a few hours  ill keep them out of the way   mr worf provide security  aye sir  whats in that container  vermicula its their food  when they come out of stasis theyll be hungry   they eat this  in great quantities  what a handsome race  what did you think of the antedeans wesley  they are rather strangelooking commander  judging a being by its appearance is the last major human prejudice  your point is well taken mr data im sure they find us unattractive  we are being hailed by a small transport vessel   just coming into range  my god  whats the problem   whats she doing here  on screen captain   enterprise come in  we have you on viewer pilot  enterprise i have a passenger a vip passenger who  let me talk im sure im more articulate  mother  captain were receiving starfleet orders granting  lwaxana troi daughter of the fifth house  holder of the sacred chalice of rixx heir to the holy rings of betazed  full ambassadorial status sir   back into your dress uniform sir  and yours commander  she is listed as representing betazed at the conference  mother please dont do this to me  do what little one  jeanluc  what naughty thoughts  but how wonderful you still think of me like that  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  its so like my mother to do the unexpected  it will be pleasant to have her as a guest of the enterprise again  energize  legs where are the legs  where they belong mother right under you  i hate that  ill never completely trust this device jeanluc  capt picard mother  explain to her  im sorry they startled you mrs troi theyre antedean delegates  delegates last time i saw something like that it was on a plate  darling  jeanluc i wasnt aware you had such handsome legs  my valet is waiting you may beam him aboard now   you remember mr homn of course  it would be hard to forget him  i keep him despite the outlandishly lustful thoughts he spews at me  put that down homn  we cant deny the captain the honour of carrying my belongings  i will not interfere with mr homns duties this time  thats not what youre really thinking  you forget im a telepath  mrs troi since this is obviously significant to you   ill  ill carry it  just down this corridor  he has nice legs too little one is he still yours  humans no longer own each other that way  really  thats a custom we may have to introduce again   thank you  glad to help  i trust you will be comfortable if youll excuse me  i am serving a betazoid dinner of greeting tonight captain  it is an ambassadorial function  it sounds delightful  hes a fine man  solid reliable  hes a little bit on the stuffy side but all in all hes not that bad  mother you sound like youre sizing up a commodity  but thats exactly what men are darling especially human men  was your father ever unhappy with me  no he worshipped you  but ill never learn to see men the way you do  you will as you mature darling  and the men in your life are going to bless you for it  you are so beautiful  she actually complimented capt picard on his legs  id expect a telepath to be more discreet  the opposite she knows your mind and lets you know whats on hers  gentlemen  we must not lose sight of the fact  that we are talking about someone with ambassadorial rank  even though she may appear somewhat eccentric  lwaxana troi must be treated with appropriate respect understood   picard to pulaski  yes sir  when did you last look in on the antedean guests  doing so right now captain  are they still catatonic  status of the beings is unchanged  pulse still steady  respiration  normal for them  understood keep me informed picard out ill be in my quarters  it will be a dressuniform dinner gentlemen  sir  to which dinner was the captain referring sir  nothing ive been invited to any of you  very interesting  doctor youre not attending dinner with the rest of us this evening  ive already eaten but thanks captain  i seem to be a little early  im sure the others will be here soon  the other officers riker counsellor troi  hello jeanluc  so glad you could come  a toast to earthmen who despite their many faults  have that unique ability to charm women of all races  in all corners of the galaxy  speaking on behalf of men of earth  which is indeed an awesome responsibility i thank you   i know what youre thinking  you do  youre wondering if im seeing any other man on a serious basis   well actually i wasnt  dont worry about it jeanluc  competition seems to bring out the best in the human male  the fact is i  i was not expecting this this setting  i assumed my senior officers would be attending  you never assume anything where lwaxana troi is concerned  betazoid women are full of surprises  strange  im not really very hungry tonight  i wonder whats made me lose my appetite any ideas  of course youre giving thanks for your food id forgotten that  i wonder how many other cultures have similar customs  i dont know  well lets find out cmdr data  yes captain  mrs troi and i are having a very interesting discussion  about various societies ways of giving thanks  the betazoid use of the chime for instance  the use of the chime is quite unique but not dissimilar  to the ooolans of marejaretus vi  who use two stones continuously struck together during a meal  they eat until the stones are broken  or the oligarchy on atifs iv which requires  data this is fascinating dont you agree mrs troi  commander if your duties permit why not join us for dessert  im sure mrs troi would much appreciate your company   what  indeed sir  im on my way data out  how could you think id want to share our time together  with that robot of yours  because of datas wonderful afterdinner conversation  his anecdotes are the stuff of legend aboard this ship  so using the square root of pi  and multiplying by nine to the third power  i was able to accurately calculate the distance to the crab nebula  fascinating data absolutely fascinating  im sure mrs troi  would love to hear the one about the  anomalous chemical composition of brown dwarf stars  not really  yes captain a particularly spellbinding subject  in most stars the rare earth element europium  is enriched relative to samarium and gadolinium   is that so  it is however  your mother seems an interesting woman deanna  perhaps i should tell you about my mothers condition  condition  it occurs to betazed females as they enter midlife we call it the phase   midlife as in human menopause  similar  its only at midlife that a betazoid female becomes  well fully sexual if you know what i mean  yes i think i do  i also think that i saw the captain on his way to her quarters   i wonder if i shouldnt warn him  no  as ships doctor i consider it  an excellent exercise for his reflexes and agility  doctor  staying ahead of your mother  yes an animal is always at its best when hunted  or when hunting  at this point the second coorbital satellite avoids a collision  deanna thank the four deities youre here  am i interrupting  no i must as a matter of fact be getting back to the bridge  captain perhaps i should remain and further entertain our guest  no i mean im sure youre needed on the bridge as well  well  thank you for a delicious meal  we must do this again sometime  i know we will  well little one  the captain is every bit as charming as your father was  data you will never know how much i owe you for that  indeed captain  i know many more anecdotes for example   data  sir   later  yes sir  why come aboard at a time like this  i had no choice i was going to pacifica so were you  dont be absurd you knew what would happen   what stage is it in  i have it under control  what stage is it in  far enough along for me to enjoy it little one  now i know why you wore that dress  dont be ridiculous this simple dress nothing provocative   what are we going to do  ill do the only honourable thing   your captain has the inside track  mother dont even think it  why not he was all through dinner  i was what  i tell you deanna for a telepath  your mothers accuracy leaves much to be desired  actually her telepathic prowess is quite advanced except for now  except for now  dont misunderstand me counsellor  your mother is a beautiful person  my mother is beginning a physiological phase  one that all betazoid women must deal with in midlife  yes troi warned me about it when we started seeing each other  a betazoid woman going through this phase  quadruples her sex drive   or more  more   you never told me that  i didnt want to frighten you  she has opted for the only dignified option open to her  isolation  she has decided to focus all her sexual energy on one male  who will eventually become her husband  it seems captain that you are the early favourite  congratulations sir  im not amused number one  there must be some way to convince her that its quite impossible  without offending her  you cant apply human logic to this  a betazoid woman in the phase  would be shocked and deeply resentful should you spurn such advances  she would take it personally  well under the circumstances  i think it would be prudent  if i were to make myself  less available for the duration of the journey  agreed  setting san francisco california united states of america  the year 1941 ad  the office of dixon hill private investigator  program complete you may enter when ready  hi dix
