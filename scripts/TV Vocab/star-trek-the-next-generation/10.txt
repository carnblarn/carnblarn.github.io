                captains log stardate 415905  having dropped off counselor troi for a visit home  we were fortunately close to the sigma iii system  when its federation colony made an urgent call for medical help  an accidental explosion has devastated a mining operation  include a burn unit with each kit  identify the most critically injured and beam them to cargo bay six   dr crusher this is the captain  dr crusher here  additional information the number of colonists at the site is 504   are you prepared for that many  we believe so sir  captain we are now at warp 91 sir  we will be at the colony in 32 hours sir  schematics suggest the explosion was caused  by a methanelike gas seeping in from underground  captain im picking up a force field its  the q entity its identical to the grid we encountered   it reads solid sir  emergency full stop  reversing power sir  not now damn it q  shields and deflectors up sir  now reading full stop sir  humans i thought by now youd have scampered back  to your own little star system  if this is q im addressing we are on a mission of rescue  we the q have studied our contact with you and are impressed  we have much to discuss  including perhaps the realization of your most impossible dream  intriguing as that is we are on an urgent journey after perhaps  you will abandon it my business with you takes precedence  if my magnificence blinds you then perhaps something more familiar  starfleet admiral q at your service  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  captains log supplemental  our rescue mission to sigma iii has been halted by an immense grid  and an untimely visit from q  youre no starfleet admiral q  neither am i an aldebaran serpent captain but you accepted me as such  hes got us there captain  the redoubtable cmdr riker whom i noticed before  you seem to find this all very amusing  i might if we werent on our way to help some suffering dying humans  your species is always suffering and dying  no lt worf make no move against him unless i order it  pity you might have learned an interesting lesson  macro head with a micro brain  you said you had the realization of impossible dreams to offer us  when this rescue is completed i will listen to your proposal  subject to its being acceptable  subject to foolish human values picard why do you distrust me so  why at our first meeting you seized my vessel  you condemned all humans as savages  and tried us in a postatomic  attacked my people and again seized my vessel  and that angered you seized my vessel  you interfered with our farpoint mission  you threatened to convict us as ignorant savages  if while dealing with a powerful life form  we made any mistake and when we didnt  the q became interested in you  does no one here understand your good fortune  seized my vessel  the complaints of a closed mind  too accustomed to military privileges  but you riker and i remember you well what do you make of my offer  we dont have time for these games  games did someone say games  and perchance for interests sake a deadly game  to the game  where are we  a classm world gravity and oxygen within our limits  twin moons where are we  considering the power demonstrated by q the last time anywhere  assuming this place even exists  but it wont be boring if q is anything hes imaginative  seems our captain wasnt meant to be here  security this is the captain  security  engineering this is the bridge  turbolift control do you read  this is the captain  sir over there  join me riker a good game needs rules and planning  didnt your own hartley say  nothing reveals humanity so well as the games it plays  almost right  actually you reveal yourselves best in how you play  sir what he has in mind might provide us with vital information  incredible i was just thinking about an oldfashioned lemonade  and so it became that an excellent thirstquencher  it gets rather hot out here on this plain  what about my people  whatever theyd like of course  drink not with thine enemy  the rigid klingon code that explains something of why you defeated them  still fascinated with the human past perhaps youre not that original  au contraire its the human future which intrigues us  and it should concern you the most  of all the species yours cannot abide stagnation  change is the heart of what you are but into what thats the question  that is what humans call a truism   you mean hardly original  youre the one who said it  while were at it this isnt part of any human future  true i borrowed this from your stodgy captains mind  this is the dressing for a game we will play  now games require rules rewards  dangers familiar settings that sort of thing  this isnt that familiar to me data  this is from europes napoleonic era late18th early19th centuries  this is a campaignheadquarters tent  his uniform is that of a french army marshal  outranking even an admiral  would i go from a starfleet admiral to anything else  of course you wouldnt  but napoleonic equipment on an alien planet  one so different it has twin moons  as you said i am nothing if not imaginative  the game should reflect that  shall it be a test of strength meaningless since you have none  a test of intelligence then equally as meaningless  but it needs risk something to win and something to lose  if we must play a game what would we win  the greatest possible future you can imagine  which requires something totally disastrous if you lose  the point of this game shall be  can any of you stay alive  if your game is fair we will  for shame worf  fairness is such a human concept think imaginatively  this game shall in fact be completely unfair   youve gone too far  game penalty  where is she q you can forget your game  to use a 20thcentury term shes in a penalty box  shell remain there unharmed unless one of you merits a penalty  unfortunately theres only one box  if any of you are sent there dear tasha must give the box up  and where does she go  into nothingness  i entreat you to obey the rules of the game  the only one who can destroy your tasha now is you  captains log  damn it i cant even make a log entry  i wish i could help you captain  where is everyone else  down on some planet   some planet why are you here  well i  it sounds strange  but im in a penalty box  a penalty box  qs penalty box it sounds strange but it definitely isnt  i know that one more penalty  by anyone and im gone   gone  yes i am gone  it is so frustrating to be controlled like this  lieutenant  tasha its alright  what in the hell am i doing crying  dont worry  there is a new standing order on the bridge  when one is in the penalty box tears are permitted  captain  if you werent a captain  consorting with lowerrank females  especially ones in penalty boxes destructive to discipline they say  but then again youre what only human  penalty over  a marshal of france  ridiculous  one takes the jobs he can get  for example starlog entry stardate today  this is q speaking for capt jeanluc picard  who we consider too bound by starfleet customs and traditions  to be useful to us  the enterprise is now helpless stuck like an earth insect in amber  while its bridge crew plays out a game whose real intent is to test  whether the first officer is worthy of the greatest gift the q can offer  so youre taking on riker this time  excellent hell defeat you just as i did  shall we wager on that your starship command against  against your keeping out of humanitys path for ever   done  done youve already lost  riker will be offered something impossible to refuse  geordi can you see worf  id see the freckles on his nose if he had them sir  hes at the third ridge  the third ridge  moving well too  good he sees them  listen to me q you seem to have some need for humans  concern regarding them  why do you demonstrate it through this confrontation  why not a simple direct explanation a statement of what you seek  why these games  why these games why the plays the thing  im surprised you need ask your human shakespeare explained it all  he did but dont depend on one view  a pity you dont know the content of your own library  hear this and reflect  all the galaxys a stage  world not galaxy all the worlds a stage  you know it if he were living now hed have said galaxy  how about this life is but a walking shadow  a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage  and then is heard no more  it is a tale told by an idiot  full of sound and fury signifying nothing  i see so how we respond to a game tells you more about us  than our real life this tale told by an idiot  interesting  thank you glad you enjoyed it perhaps a little hamlet  i know hamlet what he might say with irony i say with conviction  what a piece of work is man how noble in reason  how infinite in faculty  in form in moving how express and admirable  in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god  you dont see your species like that  i see us one day becoming that q  is it that which concerns you  those soldiers have formed a skirmishing line i think it is  and theyre headed this way  armed with ballandpowder muskets  thats what they look like sir  muskets are appropriate to the  but it is hardly a weapon by our standards  a lead ball propelled by gunpowder  against phasers just one phaser could finish off an entire regiment  except that it hardly sounds like q to give us an advantage like that  unless  drop your weapons  that was me worf i was checking that the phasers still operate  incredible he came out of nowhere  a warriors reaction  report what did you find  they may wear old earth uniforms but they arent human at all  more like vicious animal things  those soldiers are moving in fast sir  data if youve got a theory about whats happening  think fast cmdr riker and move fast  those arent muskets  you have one chance to save them send them back to the ship  youll let me beam them  send them the same way i do ive given you the power  do you understand ive given you the power of the q  use it  use your power  use your power  lieutenant take the conn position engineering   engineering sir  are all systems back on line  back on line sir they were never off  captain youd better look at this  theres been no interruption in course or speed both are constant  its as though we never stopped  we never did lieutenant  q suspended time   wheres cmdr riker  he was with us  he must still be on the planet  we were under attack by these animal things   animal things  maybe data can explain better sir  you may find it aesthetically displeasing ill file a report  data  sir the important thing is why is cmdr riker missing  understood but i suspect cmdr riker is perfectly safe  at least in a physical sense  q has an interest in him  in fact qs entire visit concerns our first officer   and the reason for that sir  i wish i knew  q first became interested in him at farpoint  i have no idea what it means  meanwhile we must proceed with our rescue mission  something amuses you perhaps youll share the joke with me  the joke is you  strange gratitude  from one who has been granted a gift beyond any human dream  how can you not appreciate being able to send your friends to their ship  or send the soldiers back to the nothingness from which they came  you must understand that you can send yourself back to the ship  or to earth or change your shape become anything you want to be   what do you need  need  you want something from us desperately  want something from you foolish fragile nonentities come riker  you sound like your captain  now thats a compliment q but not an answer  riker we have offered you a gift beyond all other gifts  out of the goodness of your heart  after farpoint i returned to where we exist the q continuum  which means what  the limitless dimensions of the galaxy in which we exist   i dont understand  of course you dont  and you never will until you become one of us  until would you mind going over that again  if youd stop interrupting me  this is hardly a time to be teaching you the true nature of the universe  however  at farpoint we saw you as savages only  we discovered instead that you are unusual creatures  in your own limited ways  ways which in time will not be so limited  were growing  something about us compels us to learn explore  yes the human compulsion  unfortunately for us this power will grow stronger  century after century aeon after aeon  aeons have you any idea how far well advance  perhaps in a future that you cannot yet conceive even beyond us  you see we must know more about this human compulsion  thats why we selected you to become part of the q  so you can bring to us this human need and hunger  that we may better understand it  i suppose thats meant as a compliment  or maybe its my limited mind  but to become a part of you  i dont even like you  youre gonna miss me  come on not again  cmdr riker whats going on i was sitting in school and  worf my phasers gone are you armed  no  where is q lf you have an answer to any of this  look out  wesley no  no damn it  damn it to hell  you   you did that  and thats not all  that grid their wounds  only the q can do that  captains log stardate 415914  from quadra sigma iii  where the survivors of a disaster desperately need us  on the enterprise first officer william t riker  needs help nearly as badly  but this is a subject far out of my experience  out of any humans experience  how the hell do i advise you  you know the implications as well as i  no one has ever offered to turn me into a god before  what the q has offered you has to be close to immortality  its no lie about controlling time and space   weve seen it in what they can do  and in what i can do  if you are to refuse his offer you must not use this power again  its too great a temptation at our present stage of development  you fear i wont be able to say no  you tell me are you strong enough to refuse to use that power  certainly  no matter how tempted no matter how difficult q makes it  you have my word  good i know what your word means  in orbit of quadra sigma iii  ready to beam down rescue team to underground emergency area  this way sir  are there any others  gone its just us  commander  theres somebody under here  youre getting close data  its too late shes dead  if only wed gotten here a little sooner  sir if indeed you have the power of q  i dont understand certainly you cant bring her back to life  i cant im prevented from that by a promise  i was wrong to make that agreement i could have saved that child  you were right not to try once you get accustomed to that power  when i used it before i saved most of our bridge crew  and when you grow to like it too much  as soon as its convenient  i want a meeting with you and your bridge staff  as soon as we are secure with this rescue operation  ill discuss all that this new power  we can confer here if no one objects  the bridge is fine ive called the entire staff  correction knowing the decision you face  i have permitted you this gathering  of course jeanluc  wesley this meeting is not for you  why not sir you helped make me a bridge officer  acting ensign  alright he stays  because ive been given unusual powers im not suddenly a monster  except for these abilities and i dont yet know how far they go  im the same william t riker youve always known  well  everyone still looks uncomfortable  perhaps they all remember that saying power corrupts  and absolute power corrupts absolutely  you believe i havent thought of that jeanluc  and have you noticed how you and i are now on a firstname basis  number one  will something has happened already  in what way  havent you seen how much i regretted not saving that child  using the power of q to save her may not have been wrong  no more than it was wrong to save you from those soldier things  lets keep in mind that that particular danger was invented by q  what we represent to the q commander are lowly animals  tormented into performing for their amusement  actually they think very highly of us  we have a quality of growth which they admire  or fear  no weve learned the q do not admire us  the q has muddled your mind  dont you understand his incredible gift to me  are these truly your friends brother  let us pray for understanding and for compassion  let us do no such damn thing what is this need of yours for costumes  have you no identity of your own  i come in search of the truth  you come in search of what humanity is  i forgive your blasphemy  dont you see riker  hes nothing but a flimflam man he has been since we met at farpoint  flimflam  you offer riker jealousy  what i offer is clearly beyond your comprehension  how can you claim friendship for riker  while obstructing the greatest adventure ever offered a human  obstructing then its not certain hes not yet committed  the truly evil part of this is your jealousy  you love each one of your people  demonstrate it you have the power  to leave each one of them with a gift proving your affection  thered be no harm to give them something i know theyd like  how touching  a plea to his former captain  may i please give happiness to my friends sir please sir  in fact i authorize and support your idea riker  please feel free to cooperate with him if you wish   are you certain sir  quite certain  by all means demonstrate your gifts of affection  dont be frightened there is no way i could harm any of you  shall i guess your dreams  well leave now wesley  no wesley i may know best of all our friendship our long talks  no please  have your favorite wish my young friend  youre ten years older a man  not bad  no  no sir  but its what youve always wanted to become human  yes sir that is true  but i never wanted to compound one illusion with another  it might be real to q  perhaps even you sir  but it would never be so to me  was it not one of the captains favorite authors who wrote  this above all to thine own self be true  sorry commander i must decline  and you my friend i know what you want  youre as beautiful as i imagined  and more  then we can throw away the visor  i dont think so sir  the price is a little too high for me  and i dont like who id have to thank  make me the way i was  please  proud warrior worf  without a single tie to his own kind  no  she is from a world now alien to me  worf is this your idea of sex  this is sex  but i have no place for it in my life now  no place micro brain what possesses you  cmdr riker its too soon for this  is this because your mother objects  no  i just want to get there on my own honest  but its easier boy listen to riker  how did you know sir  i feel like such an idiot  quite right so you should  its over you have no business here  you have destroyed yourself   pay off your wager  i recall none  your fellow q know you agreed never to trouble humans again  just as they know you failed to tempt a human to join you  no lf i can do one more thing  i strongly suspect its some explaining you have to do now  extraordinary  captain we are showing that same hole in time again  our instruments say we just beamed back from our rescue mission  sir how is it that the q can  handle time and space so well and us so badly  perhaps someday we will discover  that space and time are simpler than the human equation  no coordinates laid in number one  yes sir you have my coordinates la forge  aye sir  on the board  engage
