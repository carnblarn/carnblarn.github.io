                captains log stardate 412424 our last assignment has taken us  into the remote omicron theta star system  home of our android crew member lt cmdr data  although were due at an assignment  i have decided to visit datas home planet for a few hours  in the hopes of unraveling the mystery of his beginnings  sir we are 20 minutes from omicron theta mark  stand by for subwarp head for standard orbit of planet   i wonder why datas not here  he said he wanted to be alone  perhaps this is a bigger moment for him than we thought   what are you doing  sneezing   have you got a cold  a cold what  its a disease mom said people used to get  but humans still sneeze for other reasons  and i cannot seem to do it right  why practice sneezing were going to your home planet for the first time   arent you interested in that  more than interested fascinated  one might say agog but i also find sneezing interesting  capt picard wishes to see you on the bridge  captain confirming classm reading there  but sensors show no life readings not even vegetation  strange the cruiser that found data reported farmlands   want to take her into orbit data  no thank you sir  continue on into close parking orbit  aye sir  i could say home sweet home sir  if i understood how the word sweet applies   it usually refers to memories  to ones own memories  do the memories you have include farms data  affirmative but the colonys principal interest was science  how can you hold the memories of 411 people  if that means every experience every day of their life  it does not unfortunately its the knowledge they accumulated  actually i am deficient in basic human information  sneezing for example  approaching close parking orbit  assemble your away party commander  this must be exciting for you  im tempted to lead the away team but my first officer may object  what would starfleet say an earth colony did disappear there  you see  now in close parking orbit sir  mr data welcome home  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  first officers log stardate 41245  we have found datas home  to be a completely dead world  lifeless vegetation no insects not even soil bacteria  what is it that could kill everything on an entire planet  recording signal locked onto the enterprise sir  this looks like anything but farmland  agreed sir  the soil appears almost completely lifeless  this is the position in the tripoli log recognize anything  the land contours are familiar  topographically this is the correct area  this once was rich farmland id say 20 to 30 years ago  i was discovered 26 years ago  id say that everything was dead or dying at the time data was found  i was found 20 meters in that direction sir  data any idea why you were given the colonists memories  i feel that it was done hurriedly  but i know little more here  this is where the cruisers landing party  found the signal device that led them here  and they found me lying there  you were just lying in the open  no identity record no instructions  only a layer of dust  whats the first thing you remember  opening my eyes  looking into the eyes of the tripoli landing party  they believed the signal device  sensed their presence and activated me  then this spot was your birthplace  commander  i think ive got this place figured out  this was very cleverly done  to make this look like a natural hollow in the terrain  there are signs it was constructed in a hurry  as if to hide something  yes that was it geordi  this awakens a memory remnant  the colonists hoped to remain hidden  but their fear of being discovered  led to their storing information in me  yeah thought so  no life readings in here either sir  the colonists laboratory extremely well equipped  does this stir any memories  only a vague impression of some of my functions being tested here  posted by proud parents  it depicts something that feels familiar sir  and dangerous  but i have no idea what it represents  and that is all  except  for an impression  of this being a dr soongs work area  who   dr noonien soong  he was called that here  but he traveled here under a different name  dr soong my friend was earths foremost robotic scientist  until he tried to realize asimovs dream of a positronic brain  a positronic brain he promised so much  then when he failed completely dr soong disappeared  now we know he went somewhere to try a second time  data geordi well look at this lab  you and lt worf reconnoiter the corridors  aye sir  data its you  an epidermal mould  to give your exterior the desired finish   lt yar to cmdr riker  come in lieutenant  sir this installation can hold hundreds of people  but all thats here is empty beds  thank you complete your record scans and report back  cmdr riker looks like some sort of storage area   how many more datas are there  looks like just two  i mean that and the real data  commander  can this be another me  or possibly my brother  i honestly dont know data   he needs assembling  he  data we dont know that this can become alive  it is very important for me to know sir  i never dreamed it was possible that i might find some link  with a form like my own  understood well take it back to the ship with us  captains log stardate 4124245  despite having only a few hours to explore datas home planet  we discovered something which may explain datas beginnings  if we can properly assemble and communicate with what weve found  signal from the captain they need you at the debriefing  i have been anxious to hear the chief engineers opinion  do you believe he can be made to function  it includes all the components in your body  not that we fully understand your construction  we have our top specialists working on its construction  just one thing  without disassembling you of course if we should need more  if we need to compare this with the way youre put together  bringing it here was right number one  data if your duplicate functions it may answer a lot of questions  does it appear to have  all your parts  completely sir  will  will we know how to turn it on  alright  legitimate questions need not be asked apologetically  you feel uncomfortable about your duplicate  we feel uncomfortable too for no logical reason  if its awkward to be reminded that data is a machine  remember that we are merely a different variety of machine  in our case electrochemical  lets handle this as we would anything else  agreed captain  lets begin with you data  well sir a good starting point may be  why was i given human form  to make it easier for humans to relate to you  maybe your designer had something else to prove  that humanshaped robots need not be clumsy or limited  you operate as well as we do data  better in some ways sir  look at this could be a link to the disappearance of the colonists  it was displayed in the lab it could be a childs imagination  but several children did similar drawings  dr crusher to the captain  we very much need mr datas help  hes on his way doctor  is the synthomometer reading positive or negative  press your fingers there  there  it operates almost as a switch  and these small projections  an android alarm clock  is that amusing  they time how long i remain unconscious  are you certain about us using these heating devices   i will feel nothing at all  marvelous  it should be simpler once we see how your circuitry is connected  i wont mention it to anyone you have my word  if you had an off switch doctor  would you not keep it secret  i guess i would  notice the microcircuitry here and here  and another fibroidlike connection here  lets close up  it seemed to go well thanks to a look inside mr data  but there are no signs of consciousness yet  it certainly is a good match for data  do you think so really  i wonder which was made first  he was  but they found him to be imperfect and i was made to replace him  you may call me lore  but i am also troubled by it describing you as imperfect  human language gives me difficulty too  it could mean i lack certain abilities he possesses  i wonder  but the point is whether you and it have the same capabilities  we do sir and your referring to him as it  suggests that i too fit into the category of a thing  i see your point  my apologies  gladly accepted sir  as for lores abilities his syntax and grammar  suggests he was given human memories like mine  you have equal strength and mental abilities  i believe so sir  which requires that i now ask a very serious question  since the two of you are so closely related to each other  the answer sir is that my loyalty is to you  and starfleet completely  thank you commander i was certain of that  helm control is here the ships heading is given in degrees  in a full circle this way   then you say mark  on the nose  that separates it from another  on a right angle to this one  by ordering a heading so many degrees this way  and so many this way  the ship can travel in all three dimensions  the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle  is equal to the sum of the square of the other two  something  which i once heard but never understood  youll learn more when the captain approves your being on the bridge  have i committed an offence  you will find many rules on starships that must be learnt  youre very clever wesley  i now have duties to perform correct  were you ever this anxious to please data  never i judge lore to be superior in that desire  because i was designed to be so human my brother  i enjoy pleasing humans  my brother that has a nice sound to it data  you consider it important to please humans  its not important  there are many things of importance some more than others  cmdr rikers hypotenuse question tricked you  into showing your knowledge was greater than you were indicating  he didnt seem that clever ill be more careful  you tend to underestimate humans  praising young wesley on the helm  a child  he has a childs body but we have found him to be much more  thank you for that information too  you do care about how i perform  i pledge to be worthy of your teaching my brother  try not to be jealous of my abilities  what information are you requesting  everything available on a dr noonien soong  good old oftenwrong soong  a joke brother  actually he was a genius by human standards  but he destroyed his reputation by making wild promises  about his positronic brain design almost all of which failed  promises he later proved to be true  which made you and me possible brother  our beloved father  will i soon have a uniform like that brother  i got mine after four years at the academy three as ensign  ten or 12 on space duties at lieutenant grade  a system designed to compensate for limited human ability  and you brother are beginning to think as a human  you and i are completely different from them  are you truly satisfied with the knowledge and memory  of a few hundred human colonists  suppose it could reflect thousands or millions  or the knowledge of hundreds of millions of life forms of every kind  how  we will discuss that in time  and will we also discuss lore which of us was constructed first  it would be foolish  to underestimate you brother  yes i lied when i said you were made first but with good reason  dr soong made me perfect in his first attempt  but he made me so human the colonists became envious of me  you lived with the colonists  until they petitioned soong to make a more comfortable  less perfect android  in other words you brother  havent you noticed how easily i handle human speech  i use their contractions  for example i say cant or isnt  you say cannot and is not  a very old joke  but you also have trouble with their humor am i right  quite true  i keep trying to be more human and keep failing  do you realize brother  i can help you become more human  and do you realize lore  that i am obligated to report all this to our ships captain  i assumed as much when i began studying you  may i use this to learn more about this vessel and its customs  use it to describe your time among the colonists  including all you know about what happened to them  i promise a report of great detail and accuracy  thank you lore i now have duties to perform  unless you need something more  i have more than i dreamed possible brother  captains log stardate 412425  thanks to lores report we now know what happened to the colonists  using a childs drawing enhanced by lores description  our computer constructed the image  of a great crystalline entity which feeds on life  insatiably ravenous for the life force in living forms  capable of stripping all life from an entire world   how did data escape or lore  lore had been disassembled  he explained it as jealousy from the colonists  data wasnt yet alive  data could be left out in no danger from that creature  whatever happened to the colonists  hed be found by the first crew to respond to his signal  so dr soong left proof that his experiment did work  captain how believable do you find that crystal thing  with so little of even our galaxy explored it is at least possible  data are you expecting lore to come up here   he left your quarters  to go  my turbo sensors say he went to deck four worf  he examined some work tools and finegrind quadratanium  which is used in our construction  that compound is no more suspicious than a human looking for an ointment  but i should check it out  youre watching everything he does is that the act of a brother  its the act of a starfleet officer obeying his captain  captain  speaking strictly as security chief  how much can you trust data now  i trust him completely but everyone should realize  that that was a legitimate security question  thank you sir  lesson number one in becoming more human  you must observe all human customs  champagne  an ancient ritual practiced when they observe events of importance  my brother i toast our discovery of each other  may it fill our lives with new meaning  i have some doubts about the value of human customs in this  my brother  and let us toast also dr soong  who gave me the full richness of human needs and ambitions  a perfect match for my mind my body  brother  and let us toast also  the great crystal entity with whom i learned to communicate  before dr soong disassembled me  i earned its gratitude by revealing the way to the colonists  imagine its gratitude when i give it the life on this vessel  this is strange sir  i show cmdr data transmitting on a subspace channel  i know datas been researching dr soongs background  lets be sure  would you look in on cmdr data discreetly  yes sir  crystal entity  upon arriving here you can identify me as the machine named data  end of message  come in please  glad you are here  lore attacked me i had to turn him off  why did he do that data  he discovered we have been using sensors to follow what he does  i practiced his facial tic do i have it right  id suggest you forget imitating him  if youd said weve instead of we have  i might have suspected you were lore  yes i do use language more formally than lore  please inform the captain i will come to report this  aye sir  wes tell me again how data said he immobilized lore  he told me he just turned him off mom doctor  question mr data  did you not swear me to secrecy about your off switch  a change of mind  if i cannot trust the bridge crew whom can i  captain bogey coming in on a five oclock tangent  no id signal captain   main viewer on tangent  shields up yellow alert  friendly greetings all languages all frequencies  i cant believe it can overtake us this fast  beautiful isnt it  i recognize it sir  its the crystal image lore described  my god  still no id sir  also no answer to our inquiries  did you get a direct look  its like a giant snowflake but more complex  the entire electromagnetic spectrum is inside it   but ive no idea what it is  thank you data  anything else that lore could tell us may be important   can you control and question him  i must examine him  captain recommend that you do not let him roam the ship freely  ensign  wesley is being alert and responsible  something to be encouraged come you can watch everything i do  not if i have a choice  enough when addressing a senior officer  as his trainer its my fault  you will show proper respect i will accompany you to make certain  with your approval sir  be careful of lore  good he is still unconscious  notice the same twitch even though he is unconscious  stay back we may have problems if he senses someone else is near  i have a few questions to ask you  lore it is data  he senses you i cannot control him if you stay  i will record what he says  bring it to the bridge immediately  and you want to be as stupid as them dear brother   well number one  it was lore sir  same facial twitch  lying unconscious as data described  it became violent apparently sensing wesley and i  or is it lore pretending to be data and faking it  i asked for cmdr rikers report acting ensign crusher  if you cant accept the limits of that appointment  captain  deflector shields holding  torpedoes and main phasers to ready go to red alert please  weapons ready sir  no captain let me talk to it  you didnt say you could do that   affirmative talk to it  open hailing frequencies  crystal form i identify myself as data  advising you to stop your attack  the humans here are powerful  capable of injuring or even destroying you  now i call that communicating  suggest moving fast to confirm what i told it  permission to use the large transporter in cargo room three  to beam up some living pattern perhaps a large tree   which youll beam to the entity  correct riker  ships phasers will then disintegrate it  proving we are dangerous  make it so  sir  do it  sir i know this may finish me as acting ensign  shut up wesley   let me know what he does  aye sir  shut up wesley  doctor  since i am finished here may i say  shut up wesley  that what i have said wouldve been listened to  if it came from an adult officer  permission to go to my quarters sir  agreed doctor go with him  youre putting me off the bridge  im asking you to keep an eye on your son during this  emergency close  now show me your warrior fierceness  ill look but i shouldnt have let you talk me into this  its data hes been hurt   you know how to turn them on  this is very serious  so just tell me to shut up wesley and i will  youre being very unfair wes  data the crystal thing is outside the ship  lore is loose on the inside  how badly are you hurt  i will function sufficiently to stop lore  crystal entity form  its your old friend  very good youve understood perfectly so far  next i will signal that im transporting something out  the deflector shields will turn off for a moment  and if you move in at that time  how sad dear brother  you make me wish i were an only child  then why this marvelous gift  the troublesome little manchild  are you prepared for the death youve earned little man  if you take one more step towards my son  motherhood  back off or ill turn your little man into a torch  i promise him exquisite pain unless you obey me too brother  move away data please  do you see now the advantages of being completely human  it includes kindness  i give you your life doctor  go home quickly  and i may not injure your son at all  i will stay with wesley  go or hell be shrieking by the count of five  one two  three  four  thank you for my human qualities dr soong wait  a small payment for your sons misdeeds  the transporter  wesley now  lores gone sir permanently  doctor now that wesleys safe go to sickbay at once  captain the crystal thing has begun to move away  are you alright  yes sir im fine  get rid of that damn twitch and put on the correct uniform  yes captain   are you able to return to duty  yes sir  then do so let the bridge know all is well here  aye sir  its gone sir without lore it couldnt reach us  were overdue a computer refit  do you ever wonder if data is more human or less human than we want  i wish we were all as well balanced sir  agreed
