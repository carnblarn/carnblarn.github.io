                captains log stardate 412945  our destination the classm beta cassius planet known as haven  it is so renowned for its peaceful beauty  that some believe it to have mystical healing powers  we will rest and relax all too briefly i fear  such a beautiful world  legends say it has been known to mend souls and heal broken hearts  legends which are totally unsupported by fact captain  such legends are the spice of the universe  because they have a way of sometimes coming true  lt yar to cmdr riker  your presence is requested in transporter room one  sorry ladies duty calls   you needed me  an objects beaming in from haven   what  were not sure  surface station approvals coming in  alright lets bring it in  odd looking  whats going on  i hold a message for deanna troi  lwaxana troi and the honorable miller family will soon arrive  the momentous day is close at hand rejoice  no  whats going on  jewels look at these jewels  theyre bonding gifts what you would call wedding presents  whos getting married  i am  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  i was certain it would never happen captain  the years id spend on this mission  the distance it has taken me away from home  as you must have heard genetic bonding is a betazoid tradition  steven miller was my fathers closest friend  your father was human deanna the millers are human  will you and your husband be staying with the ship  no sir  then  i will just say congratulations for now deanna  youll excuse me  bill  more than anything in the world anything  you want to be a starship captain true   thats not all i want deanna  i can feel that  i know you care within those limits   did you hear what i said  every word  this whole thing is still bizarre  im sorry  come dance at my wedding  ill try  a message from planet haven counselor  they wish to beam the miller wedding party aboard  im jeanluc picard captain of the enterprise welcome aboard  quite some starship you have here captain  look forward to this visit  you couldnt be  im deanna  deanna darling you probably dont even remember me  wyatt was absolutely right she is a beauty  im wyatt  isnt this simply beautiful  i knew romance was still alive somewhere  id like you to have this chameleon rose  it changes color with the mood of its owner  its wonderful thank you  when is my mother arriving  your mother is still on the planet  why  is there a place for my parents to rest captain  well were not really tired son  besides id like to see some of the ship  steven you know full well  lwaxana troi isnt about to beam on board until we leave   so  you can see your quarters now  show the millers to their accommodations  i shall join you later  two more are ready to beam in sir  so be it  wyatt seems a fine young man  yes he does but im not what he expected  i dont understand  neither do i but im definitely a surprise of some sort to him  i should warn you sir  my mother is a little eccentric  where is everyone i hate that  hello mother  dont say it think it use your mind not your mouth  hello mother  deanna shame what has this life done to you  no dont tell me youre the captain  deanna explained your telepathic abilities  that wasnt telepathy just common sense  who else would they send but the captain  you may carry my luggage  mother  no thats quite alright  im indebted to your mother for the fine counselor she  this way  its inappropriate  yes you seem to be struggling  a man your age must keep in shape  mother i wont go another step  a starship has its customs just as we do  if youre my mothers valet then please valet  dont let me keep you from your duty  i apologize for her behavior   youve embarrassed your captain  no  anything to avoid a quarrel on this occasion  its amazing how your accent reminds me of your father  your last valet tried to rid me of it  what happened to mr xelo  i had to terminate his employment xelo was attracted to me  his thoughts became truly pornographic  the thoughts of wyatts father were almost as vulgar   but he doesnt have  passenger accommodation  he doesnt have xelos imagination  between him and that womans inane chatter its a wonder i made it   how do you like the millers  very pleasant  its shocking how theyve changed since my husband and i knew them  its probably because ive grown beyond them  you realize that with betazoids our ability to read thoughts  does see us grow faster than the typical plodding human  mother thats enough  so youre not totally out of practice  good very good  we hope you find this comfortable  yes the room is adequate small but adequate  you will adjust the temperature to a civilized level  ill see what i can do  now if you will excuse me im sure you have much to talk about  yes captain you may go  youve been slack little one allowed your mental powers to rust  only to avoid confusion mother  humans constantly think one thing and say another  they do dont they poor dears  our style of complete honesty frightens them  on that subject mother  there is such a thing as too much honesty with humans  if theyd only say what they think instead of hiding it  a shipload of such inconsistency could drive one insane  darling im terribly sorry about what happened here truly i am  steven miller tracked me down and reminded me of our vows  mother im having trouble believing in those vows as once i did  deanna  but ill honor them of course im a betazoid  you may find wyatt an unusual person  ive sensed remarkable depths in him  message coming in from haven  on screen  im valeda innis first electorine of haven capt picard  greetings electorine im picard  your presence honors us and your timings fortuitous  in what way  an incoming vessel has bypassed our stargate violating our law  it has refused any attempt at communication   do you believe it to be hostile  not communicating is hostile  we have no defensive capabilities  our treaty with the federation  specifies your obligations in that matter  agreed but lets hope it doesnt become a defense matter  of course captain but i am very happy we have you here  come in  i wanted to apologize for my mothers behavior  your mothers honest i respect that  yes she never lets up  ill admit her honesty is a bit persistent  i never heard it described better but it is a betazoid trait  ill try to be only half as annoying  lets see what can i tell you about myself  im a medical doctor for what thats worth  doctor  if you were sensing my thoughts youd know   you can do that cant you  sometimes  this must be what mother felt about you  we could read each other eventually   can i take that as a compliment  absolutely  i only ever felt this  well with someone whos on this ship   do i have competition  no  what he wants most is to captain a starship  what i want is to cure people  well im a practicing psychologist maybe we could work in concert  we are going to be together a long time  yes that is the point of marriage i suppose  i really thought youd tell me you were an artist  i just felt your mind very much on these  they are your work arent they  i can see that itll be hard to keep secrets from you  this is why you were surprised when you first saw me  this woman  you thought i would be this woman  i have seen this face  ever since i was a boy  when i closed my eyes at night i could hear her whispering my name  knowing you were betazoid  i assumed it was you projecting yourself into my mind   im sorry im not what you wished  no  please dont mistake a childish fantasy for disappointment  you are so beautiful i feel honored   youve no idea who she is  it doesnt really matter now  captains personal log  i trust my concern over the problems of counselor troi  are not based merely on losing a highly valuable crew member  but i feel that shes trapped by a custom of her world  which 24thcentury life has made unwise and unworkable  i wish i could intervene  on the viewer captain  unidentified vessel traveling at subwarp speed bearing 2357  subwarp its several hours away then  lets take a look enlarge to maximum  increasing magnification sir  mr data is that the trouble i believe it is  if you mean a tarellian vessel sir it is  arent the tarellians all dead what are they doing here  picard to sickbay dr crusher to bridge urgent  they must not be permitted to destroy us or the planet  captains log supplemental  it has been believed the tarellian race was extinct  an assumption contradicted by one of their vessels approaching haven  its present velocity suggests a possible answer  a damaged vessel could explain it  without warp speed it would take this long to get here  go on with your briefing mr data  tarella was classm like earth with similar humanoid life forms  unfortunately hatred overpowered intelligence  there were hostilities  between the inhabitants of two land masses  one group unleashed a deadly biological weapon on the other  in the end both became infected  makes one question the sanity of humanoid forms  can you identify the origin of the infection  they had reached earths late 20thcentury level of knowledge  thats all you need if youre a fool  a deadly infectious virus which is not difficult to grow  we learnt the story in training some tarellians went to other worlds  but died along with the populations they infected  its well covered in academy training  many tried to avoid civilized worlds  only to be hunted down and destroyed  it was believed that the last tarellian ship  was destroyed eight years ago by the alcyones  yes sir  exactly when will they arrive  exactly 13 hours  thank you  which creates a difficult problem for us  our treaty requires us to protect haven  and federation policy requires that we assist life forms in need  which must include the tarellians  i shall want you to help find answers thank you  however there will be time for a second voluntary assignment  the prejoining announcement of counselor deanna troi  and wyatt miller  weve talked it over and the ceremony will be tomorrow  and captain would it be possible for you to perform the ceremony  of course if all parties request it  all parties do not request it its out of the question  you are not practiced in the ways of betazed joining   thats quite true  so you are totally unqualified  he is qualified to lead a traditional earth ceremony  which is what this will be  i thought you had no sense of humor earth wedding ridiculous  we live on earth now  so thats why you want that backward ritual  terrible to see a woman go downhill like this   mother  downhill  the matter is settled mr homn will conduct the joining  but homn cant even talk  no matter he is adept in sign language  the matter is closed  who are you to tell us what we should do  your ignorance is astonishing  i am lwaxana troi daughter of the fifth house  holder of the sacred chalice heir to the holy rings of betazed  who are you  it is a starfleet tradition that at social gatherings  disputes are not permitted  i hereby declare therefore all disagreements resolved  a toast to the young couple and their families  and  and may this union be a productive one  hear hear  cheers  considering the rate at which you imbibe sir  is your lineage at all mixed with human  is it true captain that theres a tarellian ship headed for haven   yes it is true  thats amazing  ive read everything about them  virus analysis was my favorite subject at medical school  then id very much like to confer with you  im pleased to have a medical colleague on board  yes maam doctor  would it be possible to prepare medical needs  geared toward the tarellians needs  then beam it over to avoid infection  what do you think  its a very considerate idea our sickbay is at your disposal  thank you  mr data  sir  youre circling the room like a buzzard  perhaps being human yourself you do not find them as  intriguing as i  must he do that  it is the betazed way of giving thanks for our food  you giving thanks besides you never did this before  i do it now unlike some people i am in growth  victoria ive forgotten whether you enjoy pets or not  love them of course  good  gently poor baby did she hurt you  if youll excuse me id like to spend time considering  the tarellian situation   yes of course  ladies and gentlemen  mrs troi im very interested in the betazed ceremony you mentioned   could you tell us more  id be delighted  its an ancient ceremony regarded as the most beautiful in the universe  after the couple remove their clothing   bride and groom go naked  all guests go unclothed  it honors the act of love being celebrated  dont worry your bodys not that bad  besides your husband quite likes the idea of seeing me unclothed  steven  you did know hes attracted to me  untrue i dont  stop this petty bickering all of you especially you mother  could you please continue the petty bickering  i find it most intriguing  may i join you  i will miss you deanna  im no longer imzadi to you  you taught me that word means my beloved  and the human heart is too small to permit that feeling now  have you discussed this with wyatt i think you should  its also damned unfair to me  i understand  i shouldve realized  humans young human males particularly  have difficulty separating platonic love and physical love  the problem is  imzadi  i couldnt not now  call it an old an old earth tradition  habit of the beasts whatever  hello you two   we were just talking about you  this is incredible   yes and in that discussion i  actually  bill was concerned that you might be upset  that i care deeply for him too  youre the one who wants to be a starship captain  ive heard that bonding would complicate things in that case  to each his own good luck with that ambition  and i very much respected what you did tonight  all i did was lose my temper   excuse me  of course  running all this is a big job  in fact you shamed them into compromise  so theyve decided that the joining will be half betazed half earth  the captain will do the ceremony and mr homn will be my best man  and well take half our clothes off  some of us still go naked  you do i do your mother my father but not my mother or the guests  capt picard will be very relieved how did you manage it  your mother relented  and i caught my father practicing naked in front of his mirror  and so  a question i shouldve asked before  deanna do you really want to go through with this  yes i want to  im a very lucky man  captains log supplemental  all attempts at warning off the tarellian ship have failed  they still refuse to communicate and im growing concerned  how do you know theyre receiving us  our sensors show a responder echo on the frequency they once used  we have a message sir coming in from haven  on viewer  captain the plague ship is approaching transporter range  we are aware of that  do you realize they can turn our wonderful world into a graveyard  please take action now before its too late  we recognize your situation   please destroy them now  we will not fire on them  you must  im certain i could disable their ship with a phaser burst  and then lieutenant  theyre within transporter range  then we cant delay any longer ready the tractor beam lt yar  target the ship activate on command   tractor beam ready  engage  got them sir  are they secure can they beam out to the planet  negative sir they cant leave that ship  i know they can receive us they can respond with lights if necessary  unless theyve all died and the ship was brought in by automation  captain  its the woman in wyatts drawings  captains log stardate 412946  orbiting haven with a tarellian vessel locked in our tractor beam  question what strange combination of circumstances  has caused a woman from someones imagination to appear on the ship  enterprise to tarellian vessel are you receiving us  my name is wrenn  and before i enquire why your tractor beam has trapped us here  is there one aboard your vessel named wyatt  captain i dont understand  its astounding  ariana was right he is here daughter  wyatt youve come just as you promised  how could i be so accurate  except for the dreams ive never seen her  sir our concern is with the threat your vessel poses to the planet  if you still carry the infection that destroyed your world  we still carry it captain  my daughter i all eight of us   eight  all of us that are left  the rest passed on during the years it took to reach haven  if youve come here because of the legend  about planet haven miraculously healing the sick  we dont ask to make contact with those living below  all we ask is to be on the edge of some sea  an unpopulated island a faraway peninsula  this is not our planet sir  but i will present your needs to those who do govern here  present the fact that we intend to die here captain  and if we die while caged by your tractor beam so be it  wyatt how do you like my new hairstyle  it will look much better when im naked  can we talk about something serious  im always serious only my pleasant nature makes it seem otherwise  please mrs troi  yes that was puzzling  a woman from another place who insists she knows you   and  who youve dreamed of for years  i was hoping that you  fascinating wyatt how easily your thoughts come through  the answer to the puzzle of ariana and you is so simple   its too simple for most humans  too simple  its something they know instinctively  but try to reject or build complicated superstitions about  all life wyatt all consciousness is indissolubly bound together  indeed its all part of the same thing  yes i have wondered if something like that  that werent so  and no doubt so has ariana which helped you two to make contact  wyatt tell me something seriously  which of these would look best on me naked  wyatt   are you feeling alright  just wedding nerves  ill take the supplies to the transporter room  ill notify the captain theyre ready  look at your father  he cant wait to strip off his clothes for that barbaric ceremony  please take care of each other  you are beautiful  but you looked the best of all in the desert on the holodeck  when we did this  you can put the supplies on the pad  dr crusher had me set the coordinates  all we need is the captains order  captain someones transporting over to the tarellian ship   override  i cant sir its too late  hello wyatt  we always thought you were a dream  youre not surprised  did you know id beam over  once we saw you were real we knew  you are a doctor  yes ive brought medicines and supplies  and i knew you would be this brave  how could you let this happen my son surrounded by those lepers  if i couldve prevented it i would   beam him back  he can never come back mrs miller  you may turn off your tractor beam captain  we will not be going to haven  we have what we really came for   wyatt  mother  mother forgive me but i must  im going to try to continue the work to cure these people  and wyatt will do it ive believed that all along  i knew i was coming to haven to meet my destiny  i thought it was to be with you deanna  it was ariana who drew me here  im sorry  wyatt im happy for you and for ariana too  youve done very well for a human wyatt  mother  captain my respects  and mine sir  goodbye  keep the chest youll have use for it someday  shame to waste the trip perhaps i should stay and join with a new mate  what  well the captains highly attracted to me but hes a little too old  perhaps i should choose you  he has other obligations mother  very well its his loss  mr homn  thank you for the drinks  try and remember your heritage little one  captain even xelo never had such thoughts about me  you may energize  that was meant as a joke captain  i was not amused   take us out of here mr riker  aye sir warp two helm  heading 57  mark 319  our destiny is elsewhere  but im happy that yours is with us counselor  warp two sir heading 57 mark 319  engage
