                captains log stardate 4123525  our location planet ligon ii  source of a rare vaccine needed on federation planet styris iv  starfleet told me to engage in a friendly visit  and open treaty negotiations to acquire this medicinal substance   standard orbit sir  lt yar calling from cargo bay one  standing by to beam the ligonian party aboard  on our way  you have the helm mr data  cargo one   this should be interesting  agreed  not only are they closely humanoid but their history is similar to ours  a highly structured society and theyre exceedingly proud  they insist on using their own transporter sir  its their way do they have our coordinates  they have theyre standing by for your signal  this is capt picard aboard the enterprise  please do us the honor of visiting our vessel  i am lutan  capt jeanluc picard  welcome aboard  my officers my secondincommand cmdr william riker  ships counselor deanna troi  and my security officer lt natasha yar  a woman your chief of security  yes lutan that is her expertise  i am honored to meet your officers  this is my secondary hagon  a sample of the vaccine  my duty lutan im required  out of my way woman  how interesting  may we prove as surprising to you  if i may suggest sir no apology  in their view it would weaken us  nothing concealed would you care to accept it  unless you care to examine it further  absolutely not  this vaccine sample is a gift of life  we are honored at receiving it  would you do us the additional honor now  of letting us entertain you  yes please prepare it we shall join you shortly  i ask forgiveness  they are strange alien beings you bear no fault  but the female  may be exactly what i have needed  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  lutan we are aware of many of your planets achievements  and its unique similarity to an ancient earth culture we all admire  on behalf of the federation  i would like to present this token of our gratitude and friendship  from chinas sung dynasty   fourteenth century  thirteenth century sir  ah yes indeed  a most thoughtful gift  we are pleased  we of ligon have been apprehensive about strangers  were not technologically advanced as you  yet we possess something you do not  a vaccine which has been found to be  an effective antidote against your dreaded anchilles fever  if you respect our customs and we see that respect  we will be friends  and we will make the antidote available to all who need it  if you require respect from us i am sure that you will see it  surrounded by such friendship i feel no need for my guards  i will return shortly prepare to transport me then  if there is anything else any further courtesy  would it be possible to see one of your wondrous holodecks  we have heard how they are used to train your officers  and for many other things  cmdr riker would you and troi demonstrate  would it be possible for lt yar to do so captain  some demonstration of defense training  youre intrigued with her having security responsibilities  but these things are not unusual with us  with us it is the duty of women only to own the land  and the duty of men to protect and rule it  much the same has happened in human history too  id like to do it sir   as a sign of respect perhaps  very well  this way please  aikido one  it wont move again until my actions activate it  you can create people without a soul  its not a real person lutan it has no life  everything it does is controlled by computer  who am i  do you hear me  but it will feel real when it hits you  a force like that cannot come from an image lutan  then you will show me hagon  thank you lieutenant how very enlightening  aikido vanish  i could create two even three  but really one is enough  as you fight with it it learns how to defeat you  even the extraordinary lt yar  it forces us to keep improving  your skill impresses me i like you  farewell my new friends of the noble enterprise  understanding has made friends of many different people  weve had a good beginning  may i also extend a personal farewell to lt yar  in your federation terms  picard to bridge red alert  shields up photon torpedoes activated sir   what comm contact have we had  their orbital control station  make contact there and on hailing frequencies  this is the enterprise to lutan and the ligonian government  you have committed an unfriendly act  insist you reply immediately  photon torpedoes ready  set them for a display blast   set  fire  where is their transporter beam  weve tried to trace it sir but to no effect  its similar to early starfleet efforts  but uses the heglenian shift to convert energy and matter in  which is actually not important at this time  this is capt picard with a message to lutan  whom i have so far acknowledged as a friend  but you have now committed what our laws regard as an attack upon us  since you have visited our vessel you know the power of it  we insist that you reply to this message  opinion counselor will they injure lt yar  i believe not sir they seem mainly curious  in the case of lutan however i did feel other needs  what kind of needs  some sexual attraction from all the males  lt yar is physically very attractive  but with lutan i felt something else  something more like avarice or ambition   other comments  if i may sir  one of the things in the briefings was their respect for patience  strongly emphasized  you can see it in the precise ritualistic way they do things  im worried about lt yar too sir  but maybe we should wait them out  stardate 4123532 i am concerned  over a full day of waiting with no response from lutan  we are testing whether they are aware of our sensors probing them  we believe we have pinpointed lutans government compound  the vaccine sir   yes doctor  the vaccine  im a physician ive seen death but not on the scale this could mean  you were testing if you could replicate the vaccine  and we cant the sample works fine as an injection  but it becomes unstable when we try to replicate it  you must get the vaccine from the planet   as much as you can immediately  im aware of that doctor  youve never had to watch a patient die from this  thats true  but i have seen my share of death  damn  where are the calluses we doctors are meant to grow over our feelings  perhaps the good ones never get them  may i speak to you about my son wesley  what oh yes alright  hes interested in starship operations  speaking as a mother of course he seems quite knowledgeable  well yes speaking as a mother  hes on the turbolift  remember you ordered him to stay off of the bridge  wesley  i havent stepped one foot on your bridge captain  sir ill see that he leaves immediately  no  no  why dont you sit at ops next to lt la forge  sir  is the whole ship deaf  sit down over there young man  temporarily  captain we have more information from the briefing studies on ligon  oh excuse me dr crusher some of this may interest you  lets hear the analysis  it is a highly structured society people live by strict codes  what lutan did is similar to what american indians once did  called counting coup  that is from an obscure language known as french  mr data the french language  for centuries on earth represented civilization  indeed but surely sir  i suggest you drop it mr data  yes sir counting coup could be touching an enemy with a stick  or taking something from him and escaping  it was considered extremely heroic  lutan considers himself heroic  risking everything in the face of our superior power  it fits lutans personality profile as well  he has an abnormally high need for achievement  selfimage to him is a function of what he thinks hes achieved  those who set their standards too high can kill to meet them  why tasha  as a starfleet security officer she represented his riskiest prize  transmission from planet surface main viewer on   well lutan what do you want  display your image please  what is required is an image of lt yar well and  are you making demands captain  sir  according to the ligon code of honor  lutan has done what he set out to do  achieve recognition for being daring and bold  weve studied this in some depth now sir  the proper thing for you to do now is to ask to get tasha back  ask for her  politely captain  and now lutan you have boldly taken lt yar from us  we ask that  that you now please return her  then come visit us captain and we shall return her to you  commander  commander   thats quite formal  so is this request sir  we believe it would be preferable if the captain led this away party  agreed sir their customs about guests make it preferable  im very much against that idea  lutan is clearly a liar and devious  counselor troi believes he is capable of killing  it is my duty to keep the captain from danger  but ligonian custom makes it clear  that a visiting leader is an honored guest  not us not secondincommand him  and the custom requires  that lutan should die rather than violate that  yes it seems reasonable put that way  but i warn you if you get hurt ill put you on report captain  welcome to my centerplace capt picard  consider yourselves my honored guests  every hospitality will be accorded you  this is my first one yareena  lutan is a fortunate man youve met counselor troi  as on your vessel you have only to name  whatever courtesy we can provide  then sir the courtesy of seeing lt yar  lt yar will be returned to you tonight  at a banquet i have arranged in your honor  id like to see her now  bring lt yar  i find it odd that a man of your experience  has such difficulty in understanding ordinary politeness  the politeness of saying please before abducting someone  the expression please is used only when requesting the person back  yours is a different world  with clear and simple ways deeply rooted in our culture  if you are willing to ask for lt yars return tonight  in front of all honor will be satisfied  one can see the importance of honor here sir  honor is everything  have you been treated well lieutenant  fine captain  but theyre showing some signs of wear  there isnt any need for concern shes been well cared for  my ships company and i are certain of your wisdom in that  for a moment i thought i heard a threat implied  but that would be foolishness  something to be avoided i agree  the festivities for her return to you are in preparation   shall we retire till then  until tonight lutan  you have granted us hospitality and the safety of your centerplace  the gifts you give us are rare and precious we thank you  and now according to the customs of your ancestors  whom we honor and respect  i am here in peace to ask for the return of lt yar  well spoken there are those among my equals here  who were wary of my approaching the federation  i am proud to have taken this step toward a treaty  and proud that we have something of great value to offer you  a priceless lifegiving vaccine  the abduction i have done according to our custom for all to see  your conduct in this matter has been beyond exemplary capt picard  but now that the moment has come i find that i cannot part with her  you speak of a code of honor  but what you are saying now by our customs is an act of war  this is not an act of war but of love  i want lt yar to become my first one  i challenge your right to supersede  no woman has challenged for 200 years  the right is mine and i will have it  natasha yar i challenge you a struggle to the death  no the challenge is unequivocally refused  then you shall have no treaty no vaccine and no lt yar  ships log first officer riker reporting  we have been informed of the challenge to lt yar  and are maintaining combat readiness  we are probing lutans compound with our sensors still unnoticed  captain deanna  did you have any idea that lutan was going to announce  that he wanted you for his first one  no sir  tell me what you know about this  nothing sir  but it was a thrill  lutan is such such a basic male image  and having him say he wants you  yes of course it made me feel good when he  troi im your friend and you tricked me  only so youd think about it completely and clearly  were all being manipulated lieutenant myself most of all  how simple all this would be without the prime directive  that thought had passed through my mind  what is this message from starbase 14  its showing the infection rates percentage illness increases  the plague on styris iv has flared up out of control  theyre estimating deaths in the millions sir  capt picard come in  i know i can win  not that id take her life of course  but id be glad to embarrass her  the idea of accusing me of taking  the plague  if anything even worse than weve heard  so they desperately need the vaccine sir  and i know i can win this challenge  you have nothing to prove here  but the vaccine is important in this case sir  youre the last person id expect to argue for taking the challenge  betazoid blood is also practical captain  the odds are very good shed defeat lutans wife easily  youd win all the bargaining points you need  the odds are  you have pointed out yourself we are all at risk  every day of every mission  i want some explanation from lutan  lutan why are you so obsessed with this lt yar  surely yareena is more desirable  certainly she can offer you much more  she owns many things many lands  its a pity you began by abducting my security officer lutan  because i should tell you  i do admire the hospitality you offer here  i am in the grip of forces you do not understand  some of it i do understand she is a rather lovely female  you surprise me captain  what do you know of needs and feelings  nothing well almost nothing in my position as ships captain  i see  but it puzzles me if you feel like that for tasha  why challenge her to a fight to the death  not i yareena i am merely a spectator  ah but you are also a man of great importance and wealth  great importance perhaps but he does  ah i see  you too understand the proper value of women  we understand that they are highly pleasant things  but after all unimportant  except for the land they own  you are a truly clever person lutan  you stand to lose nothing either way the challenge goes  a code of honor protects one captain like a magic cloak  i will order lt yar to fight  and may your cloak bring you all you deserve  come in  why that razor not the one i adjusted to perfect efficiency  shaving is a human art form data  technological perfection can shave too close  puzzling how can anything be too efficient  thousands of things are too efficient for humans  we always come back to the human equation  exactly have you continued to work on it  constantly my friend  particularly the humor a man goes to a store to buy kidneys  he says to the shopkeeper id like a pound of kiddleys  the shopkeeper says you mean kidneys  the man says i said kiddleys diddle i  its too old and you didnt tell it very well  how do you know when something is funny  its not explainable you just do  perhaps it is you geordi  includling the kiddleys ive told  includling the kiddleys now see thats funny  it was not meant as a joke  the tongue slipped  oh boy  riker to cmdr data lt la forge  report to the transporter room for awayparty duty  first officer to captain ready with the away personnel   lock in on this location  locked in sir  energize  you saw the news about the plague  and how badly the vaccine is needed  we need to know as much as possible about ligonian armaments  data analyze their combat capabilities  geordi concentrate on their cutting edges  durability weaknesses in material   aye sir  from any particular point of view  from the perspective of lt yar using them in combat with lutans wife  most interesting  could this be human joke number 663  negative data thats a captains order  which makes it important to know which weapons are to be used  that wont be known until combat begins  youre right data  it does sound like a joke with the power of the enterprise  we could overwhelm this place just take what we want  i may not understand humor sir  but i am a starfleet academy graduate   which means of course  understanding the prime directive  that is ironically what this is about  by our standards the customs here their code of honor  is the same pompous strutting charades  that endangered our species a few centuries ago  we evolved out of it because no one tried to impose their own set of  sorry this is becoming a speech  youre the captain youre entitled  not entitled to ramble on about something everyone knows carry on  ships log cmdr william riker reporting  continuing our appraisal of ligonian technology  the captain wants lt yar beamed to safety  if her life becomes endangered  i fervently hope the rules of that contest make it possible  riker to transporter chief  do we have our people on sensors yet  their general area sir visual on screen now  as you see were still doing some finetuning  ive agreed to this meeting but i see no point to it  you accepted the challenge  you should know there is no physical training that matches starfleet  especially its security people  and you should know that even though these contests are rare  we make ourselves capable of them  yareena my acceptance had nothing to do with lutan  it has lutan wants you to be his first one  impossible yareena i am a career starfleet officer  how could you not love him every woman loves him  i fight for the vaccine thats the truth  the truth is i will kill you if i can  and believe me i can  theres nothing else to say  in my world its a greater honor to refuse  you are on our world  captain  im your counselor you brought me with you to ligon to be of help  then help me please  what is a way out of this   with the vaccine  mmhm  none  the weapons in that room  are surprisingly flexible durable and deadly  and light as if they were made for women to use  some still have traces of blood and poison   poison  alkaloid base lethal  what about those lengths of metal in the yard  uncertain sir however joined together  they would make a rectangle or square enclosing 121 square meters  vertically they would make a pole   or two of 22  thank you data  youre welcome sir  she wont budge she loves him without reservation  and she thinks i love him too  most interesting do you  of course i dont data  as troi pointed out im attracted to him but thats different   riker to captain  go ahead riker were alone  we can see your hosts gathering in the open area outside sir  three of them are heading for your location  thank you number one  lieutenant do you still want to go through with this challenge   do you judge your condition good  i judge it excellent sir  your weapons lt yar you may choose your size  dont touch the spines theyre poisoned  if youre not careful you could kill yourself  these i understand  first officers log supplemental  capt picard faced with a critical need for a vaccine  has permitted lt natasha yar to engage in a fight to the death  i have yet to understand his reasoning or his plan  care to lend a hand sit at ops  was i seen leaving  theyve got eyes only for the program  capt picard wanted no risk of our being overheard  you are to proceed as he indicated  captains orders two  did the captain understand what you and geordi reported  the weapons are splitsecond lethal  im here to brief you on what he plans  any lastminute instructions sir  stay alive well hope to do the rest  i speak for lutan the rules are known  let combat continue until there is a victor  it will not be interrupted  combatants hold your positions  return the weapon  careful yareena  move  were too late shes growing cold  sorry that clashes with my instructions  oh no  exactly what do you find unfair lutan  they fought to the death you saw the final blow  you know the effects of your poison  but what of your lt yar she is to become my first one now  i wont stop her if she cares to claim that honor  remember you have all yareenas wealth and lands now  at least all has not been lost   riker to captain  picard here  since you fulfilled your agreement can we now beam the vaccine aboard  yes of course  no problem number one send down a medical team  and to complete our business here we are locked on to you  five to beam up energize  welcome back captain youre wanted in the lounge  this way gentlemen  she is not dead there was no death combat  you violated our agreement  there will be no treaty no vaccine  the challenge was carried out she died lutan  there was no challenge she lives  i am a physician and saw her die  if you doubt this poison why not test it on yourself  lutan we can provide you with records of her death  and how dr crusher brought her back  at the instant of death lutan our mating agreement dissolves  but this is witchcraft yareena to discard a mate in this manner  is less painful than the one you selected for me  yareena no  even as i battled hagon i heard you calling out for me  yareena be my first one  all my land and all my goods all i have is yours to rule  how sad for you  youve lost everything  i have my honor  its such a waste  do you want him  no  there would be complications  then i will have you as my number two  take your place accordingly  well as you see captain  you may excel in technology but not in civilized behavior  what  wesley  young wesley has been manning that station for me i forgot  well thanks again for manning one of our bridge stations wesley  well see that you have another chance  yes sir  whats the delay why arent we warping out of here  set course for styris iv warp three  course laid in for styris iv sir  engage
