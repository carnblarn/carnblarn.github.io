                captains log stardate 412493  we have orbited the two major planets of the beta renner system  taking aboard delegates from those worlds  since conquering space their major life forms  the anticans and the selay have become enemies  but both have applied for admission into our federation  we are to deliver these delegates  to a neutral conference planet called parliament  in the hope their dispute can be resolved  im capt picard welcome aboard  we hope your journey will be pleasant and comfortable  arranging that will be cmdr riker  welcome aboard ill show you the accommodations  we can already smell the anticans they were taken aboard first  only because their world was first on this heading to parliament  will our quarters be near the anticans  about 100 meters apart   is that alright  no unsatisfactory  we can accommodate your wishes  well rearrange the assignments follow me  and we must be upwind from the anticans  of course sir  neither seem promising federation candidates sir  even parliaments peacemakers may find this case difficult  but do you understand this nonsense between them  no sir i never understood such hostility in earths history  really these life forms feel such passionate hatreds  over matters of custom god concepts  even strangely enough economic systems  sir my sensors are picking up an unusual energy object  on screen  confirmed sir my sensors read nothing solid  but a lot of energy and changing patterns  also traveling at warp speed sir  intriguing i can find no match with anything in our records  change course to make a close sensor pass  then increase speed to reach parliament on schedule  aye sir  worf why the interest in this  its just routine maintenance on the sensor  simple geordi  our captain wants his junior officers to learn learn learn  not just his junior ones  hold this relay off line while i adjust the circuits   security to sensor maintenance  la forge here  were making a closesensor pass on an unusual object   any problems  not at all  all equipment on line and functioning   sensors ready sir  lifeform reading   no lifeform readings sir  begin the pass  sir it is changing shape   any readings of matter there  negative sir energy only  sickbay we have a medical emergency  i repeat this is a medical emergency  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  what happened  he got hit by sensor feedback maybe  get back   you got it doc  i got it  lt worf can you hear what im saying   lets get him up  ok  come on big guy on your feet here we go  thats it  are you ok  he was monitoring the sensor console when he jerked  as though something hit him  what my sensors showed was  was a glow just for a second i cant explain it  could your visor have malfunctioned  i doubt it sir it seemed like what i saw was something real  sorry to call you sir not strictly security  its about the dietary requirements of the antican delegates  i thought that had been taken care of  so did we sir live animals were beamed aboard  we were going to preserve the meat  but they say to bring it to them alive  then do so  lt yar was confused  we no longer enslave animals for food  but we have seen humans eat meat  you saw something as tasty as meat but inorganically materialized  out of patterns used by our transporters  this is sickening  its barbaric  hes reading normal how did you manage that  yes normal   are you alright  yes perfectly  both of us quite normal now  what where am i  dont you remember  you were in the sensor maintenance room  i remember monitoring the sensor console  what am i doing here  thats a story the doctor will tell you  you feel its something we should look at more carefully  a mystery is only a mystery as long as it remains uninvestigated  i love a mystery  but this one must wait till we deliver the delegates to parliament  time and tide lt la forge go to warp eight  warp eight sir  hi mom youre back early  yes  physical sciences class  were studying dr channings theory on dilithium crystals  tell me about it  really you never seemed interested in warp theory before  dr channing thinks its possible to force dilithium  into even more useful crystals if as shown here  matter and antimatter could be aligned efficiently  would that affect navigation  this is engineering not helm control  oh yes the helms located on the bridge  mom  is something wrong  this is the helm  unless theres been some changes i dont know about  lt worf is much improved ready to return to duty  what was the diagnosis  a temporary mental aberration  doctor  when such a diagnosis concerns a bridge officer  i expect a better explanation  then i will have to run crosschecks on the library computer  klingons are so unusual in their reactions arent they  use science station two doctor  intriguing doctor  what does helm control have to do with medical crosschecks  why am i  is something wrong doctor  are you alright  yes  ill do my work in my office  thats where i should be  do you want someone to accompany you  captain there is a malfunction in this station  i cannot bring any information up on it  science two does not function either sir  engineering to capt picard  somethings wrong with warpdrive circuitry  transporter room six to bridge  transporter console malfunction sir  data this ship is less than a year out of space dock  what are the chances of this occurring  it is a virtual impossibility sir  so what the hell is going on here  and there are no explanations for these malfunctions  all the department heads have reported the damage repaired  that was not my question what caused the malfunctions  i believe it was a rampant electronic short  that jumped from system to system   but the only thing is  yes mr singh  that shouldnt be possible  the affected systems dont interact with each other  and where they do it wasnt an interlink that was malfunctioning  have you spoken with chief engineer argyle about this  with all engineering staff sir theyre just as puzzled  im not satisfied  i want an explanation by the time we reach parliament  but sir  by the time we reach parliament mr singh  these weapons were taken from two of your people  they were loitering near the selay delegations quarters  care to explain sir  these are not weapons they are tools  we use these to dispatch the animals we consume  your food is not on the same deck as the selay delegation  and these could kill  i admit some of my people are impulsive  and we all have reason to hate the selay  they appear to have the same feelings about you sir  the nature of politics  youre on notice that all your weapons  no matter what their function are being confiscated  violence will not be tolerated on the enterprise  of course not  and if any occurs i assure you  it will not be we anticans who start it  thank you sir  but we will finish it   sir warp power is fading  picard to engineering  what is the problem  we have lost the warpengine computer tie  warp five four three two  stateoftheart vessel  data signal parliament well be delayed  we will send a new arrival time as soon as it is determined  sir subspace radio is out  alright gentlemen  your theories on this sudden vulnerability in our systems  if the enterprise were so fragile she never wouldve left space dock  her systems failures are not endemic to the ship  but are the result of the actions of an adversary   we have a saboteur aboard  i believe i said that  gentlemen the question is who  it cant be one of our own people  agreed it must be someone from either alien delegation  if the ferengi bribed even one of them thats all theyd need  ferengi contacts have been detected on both selay and antica sir  can either of you suggest any other suspects  youre sounding like a private eye  inquiry  private eye  a private consulting investigator data who solves crimes  most interesting occupation  in the world of fact probably not  however in literature  criminal detection can be a fascinating exercise  sherlock holmes would have an interesting view of our mystery  but im afraid well have to find our solution  without historys greatest consulting detective  how about here mr singh  if the control network breaks off here  it leads warpengine commands off into dead ends  excellent  i can handle it from here mr crusher  but sir  you are scheduled for classwork now sorry  yes sir  but i dont learn nearly this much in school  i tend to agree but the captains orders on this are very clear  hi  solve any new problems today  i was starting to maybe mr singh sent me off to class  youre only an acting ensign  you gotta let commissioned officers do some of the work  mom ive learned a lot more than they understand  for example the dilithiumcrystals theory i was telling you about  when were you telling me about that  this morning dont you remember  honestly i dont remember  engineering to capt picard security alert  i just found mr singh hes dead  captains log stardate 412494  ive ordered an immediate investigation  into the death of assistant chief engineer singh  we continue to run on impulse power  he couldve been working there restoring warp power  according to these readings we could go back to warp speed now  those arent the same readings as when i left  singh probably repaired it just before he was killed  he couldnt have the problems were inside the engines  who else could have corrected it inform the bridge of engine status  engineering to bridge we now have warp capacity sir  all power on line  well done warp engines ready on previous heading  warp factor six  i tolerate these questions lt yar  because i need this vessel to get us to parliament  your shipboard problems do not concern me  they should our delays are your delays  the peace conference will wait for us  i must ask where you were during this vessels earth hours  of 1800 last night and 0700 this morning  eating  sir were talking about hours here  it was a large meal lt yar  and a very interesting animal  you wanted me doctor  yes concerning your memory blockout  i still dont remember having one  the same thing happened to me  i want to try hypnosis on both of you  it may restore your memory as to what happened  one thing is clear  almost all of the peace delegates answered our questions with lies  imprecise lieutenant  they omitted certain truths which in itself tells us something  we can learn something from nondisclosure  indubitably my good woman  its something the captain mentioned sherlock holmes  indubitably data has been studying him  has studied sir every case  as holmes wouldve pointed out  during the time in question something was afoot  afoot  while both sets of delegates say they were in their quarters  our crew locator sensed them passing here and here  it doesnt show where they went were still in the dark  on the contrary my dear colleague  on their return they drew medical supplies  appropriate to the treatment of minor wounds on these life forms  which leaves one conclusion  exactly they were too engaged in their affairs  to disable the ship and murder the engineer  given the choice they would rather kill each other than any of us  its elementary my dear riker  sir  beverly can you hear me  i want you to go back in your mind  to the moment when you first recall the sensation of memory loss  picture it exactly as it occurred  hes lying on the hospital bed sedated  im walking up to him  how do you feel as you lean over to take the specimen  i feel someone else  theres someone else whos there  not alone  get out get out of my mind  thats almost exactly what you said  as though there were something else inside you  it confirms the feeling of duality i sensed earlier in both of them  why didnt you report it  because sir i assumed at first it was the kind of duality  that we betazoids feel in all of you  even you sir  when you approach a decision  and ask yourself which direction to go who are you talking to  your hypnotism revealed another form of duality  yes sir i believe something invaded them  it seems the only possible conclusion  lets proceed without the pipe  yes sir if you wish sir  but i ask if youd take it as incontrovertible  that it cannot be a family member or one of the crew  yes very unlikely  then our investigation was worthwhile  weve eliminated the delegates and the ships complement  what are you suggesting  im referring to the great detectives credo sir  i quote  we must fall back on the old axiom  that when other contingencies fail  whatever remains however improbable  must be the truth  that engine computer net wasnt repaired sir  it just suddenly became alright  sometimes its the result that counts  what the oh no   what is it  helm controls down no response  bridge to captain youre needed immediately  wes alert engineering from your panel alright  im trying  report  helm is down sir theres no apparent reason  captain weve just dropped to impulse power  sir are you alright i thought i just saw  im fine  everything is fine now  why the drop to impulse power lieutenant  the helm is malfunctioning  malfunctioning youre wrong look again  captain i was ju  mr la forge  theres nothing wrong now sir everything is as it should be  in that case make our heading  sir  you have a problem with that heading  you wanna double back on our course  isnt that what i ordered  yes sir  sir im puzzled by your reversing our course  that energy cloud i believe it important we have another look at it  were behind schedule for parliament  a very important scientific discovery awaits us on this heading  perhaps youd like to share your reasoning on that  yes since we obtained minimal information on our sensor pass  right data we must go back to learn more  counselor do you believe a ship captain should explain every order  of course not sir  i demand to see the captain  stop return to your quarters  what is that doing on our deck  i demand to know why this starship has changed its course  please return to your quarters delegates  a mere change of direction hardly justifies mutiny  exactly what do you believe youre sensing from him  its just the feeling that  well that hes closed part of his mind to me  i just feel that the captain has become  perhaps dangerous  if hes dangerous if  hed have to be relieved of command  which you could do but its trouble if youre wrong  and it is all pure speculation  he has done nothing to subject the enterprise to danger  id need a medical log citing clear evidence of incapacity  you could do it without that problem  only if all command officers agreed it was vital to do so  but he has not shown any overt unusual behavior  ultimately i believe he will  as secondincommand its still in your corner  ill order medical and psychiatric exams  youll have to back me up somehow  first officers log supplemental  after meeting with senior officers  dr crusher and i will approach the captain  regarding his recent behavior  yes  id like you to come to sickbay for some examinations captain  ill be glad to when im free  id like to conduct them now sir  why  what can i do for you number one  sir troi has recommended the examinations  same question why  it is my duty to inform the captain  we believe he may be under some alien influence  which may constitute a danger to this ship  i consider it equally possible  that the two of you and counselor troi  are overworked and possibly suffering hallucinations  this is an order  you will arrange medical and psychiatric exams  both for yourself and them  doctor are you aware that everyone is behaving strangely  im concerned that youve changed the ships course  whats happened to your mind  the search for knowledge is always our primary mission  im sorry i  i really am too busy for this kind of nonsense  do i have to call security to force you to report to sickbay  no sir  what the hell   sorry wrong species  riker to security chief   yar here  security guard to engineering deck  selays are playing hideandseek with the anticans  i want them returned to quarters under guard  right away sir  come  what do you want  here are the results from the exams you ordered sir  you dont care to inspect them  please are you jeanluc  he is here   the jeanluc i know  and more   the more frightens me  and elates us  we wish you could understand the glorious adventure ahead  you and  soon well both be home  first officers log supplemental  on the orders of capt picard  we have returned to the energypattern cloud  i am convinced that something from this cloud  now shares the captains mind  but there seems to be nothing we can do within regulations  were approaching the cloud sir  very well mr la forge  bring us to within 10000km and hold us there  aye sir  shall we begin the scientific tests  theyre already under way  i have an announcement for the entire bridge  as many of you suspected  when our ship passed through the edge of this  it accidentally carried away a sentient being  much like these energy patterns were seeing here  terrifying for any intelligent being  as if a great claw had scooped one of you from your homeworld  drawn into the energy circuits it found you worf  frantic at being taken from its homeworld  and recognizing you as sentient it pleaded for help  but in ways you couldnt understand  desperately going from person to person  and then discovering the computer intelligence  in this ships memory circuits  simplistic intelligence but it furnished it enough  to slow this enterprise thing that had captured it  and it very much regrets the accidental death of engineer singh  captain  do you exist in combination with this entity  is it in control of you sir  soon after we combined we learned much about each other  a passion for the unknown we found we had similar dreams  it offered your captain  a way to realize them beyond human expectations  captain i must speak to you privately now  i understand  as an energy pattern free of the limitations of matter  he might travel anywhere at any velocity  captain do you hear me  sir i see no way for you to journey with an energy form  isnt there  hes planning to beam himself and the entity into that cloud  the transporter need not pattern your captain into matter  well beam energy only  we will become a combined energy pattern of our life forms  a resignation from starfleet has been recorded  i refuse to allow this sir  how does this resignation threaten the ship or crew  you are relieved of duty  i judge you to be disabled and mentally incapacitated  security  red alert  restrain the captain  where is he  this is blinding me  captain ill help you if youll let me  someone restrain the captain  first officers log supplemental more than an hour has passed  since the captain beamed out energy only  every effort has been made to determine his whereabouts  we have no idea what the coordinates were  hes just floating around how can we settle for that  give me a choice then  still no readings no sign of anything  mr la forge  its time to set a course for parliament warp eight   were really leaving him  commander wait  its the captain but only the captain  hes out there alone  the entity has it abandoned him  no but the combination wasnt possible out there  hes in trouble we have to beam him back  as what hes nothing but energy now  sir the entity was caught in the ships circuitry  the captain might try to get in the same way  bring us in closer la forge  moving in sir but where  theres no way to know  lets hope he can come part way himself  troi is there any way you can get a message to him  i wish i could  sensors monitoring the perimeter  ships circuitry sir nothing   bring us into the edge of it  aye sir  sir on my sensor controls  theres something here i feel it  just as before going to worf first  something crazy on my panel  commander riker  static   p for picard  hes in the ships circuitry  come to the transporter room please  there might be a way sir hurry  is it a wild theory data  we have the captains physical pattern he was the last to beam out   is what youre thinking possible  unknown  i hope the captain remembers his pattern is here  if he has his energy will be in the transporter relays now  i wish we had some sign that he was here  i guess weve no choice but to risk it  energizing sir  what the devil am i doing here  sounds like our captain  but confused this picard pattern was formed before he went out there  whats happening to me number one  i was preparing to beam out to somewhere  i remember there was talk of an entity  but it all seems so vague  i believe the captain is now his separate self sir  much of what happened is missing  what are you talking about is this still sherlock holmes  indubitably sir  at least you got rid of the damn pipe  dr crusher has asked me to steer you past sickbay  she said youve been looking tired   captain  yes lieutenant  sorry but security team two  reports they discovered blood outside the selay quarters  lieutenant this couldnt have waited a moment  its good to see you sir  the problem is a cook has been asked to broil a reptile for the anticans  and it looks like the selay delegate  riker what with the peace delegates and all  i think i do need a rest take charge number one
