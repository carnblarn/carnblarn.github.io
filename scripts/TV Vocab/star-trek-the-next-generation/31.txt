                medical log stardate 424375  ira graves is arguably the greatest human mind in the universe  he lives in near isolation on a remote planet  devoting full time to his research  eight hours ago his assistant urgently requested medical aid  i only hope we can reach him in time  any response from gravesworld  not since their initial communication  they ask for help then cut off transmission  so they cant tell if any help is on the way  ensign whats our eta at the planet   starfleet considers gravess molecularcybernetics work  to be at a critical stage they consider this a priorityone action  a man is ill treating him is my priority one  regardless of who he is   why does data want to see us  he mentioned his new image   hes been acting kinda strange  how so  if i didnt know better id say he was showing signs of insecurity  but you do know better androids dont feel such things  sometimes i think hes becoming more human than any of us realise  come in   data  geordi is counsellor troi there  yes data geordi said you wanted to see us  indeed or stated more correctly i wanted you to see me   can we come in  please  did you damage your face data  it is a beard geordi a fine full dignified beard  one which commands respect  and projects thoughtfulness and dignity  well opinions  its very different  when i stroke the beard thusly  do i not appear more intellectual  im sorry i have to go now goodbye  why was she laughing  we are receiving a transmission from gravesworld sir  its unfocused not directed specifically at us  on viewer mr worf  if anyone can hear me please send a doctor things are getting worse  try and raise her mr crusher tell them were only minutes away  its no good sir theyre not receiving us  she and graves live on the planet alone sir  then what scared her  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  captain i am picking up a signal but not from the planet  on screen mr worf   the signal is weak audio only  pipe it through  mayday  this is the uss requesting assistance  the outer hull breached environmental systems compromised  the constantinople is in that vicinity  shes a transport ship used to ferry settlers  im showing 2012 colonists aboard  outerhull breach must be an internal explosion  if so theyll all be prone to severe hypoxia  their lives are at risk weve got to help them  what about graves  he is one man  why not execute a longrange transport of an away team  to assist graves  wed be out of warp long enough to energize the beam  a touchandgo downwarping   ensign prepare to make it so  aye sir  engineering mr la forge well execute a nearwarp transport  this may be tricky i want you to do it  yes captain im on my way  assemble an away team include whoever the doctor needs  sir hundreds on the constantinople may need emergency attention   i should be there to supervise  who will replace you  lt selar she has my complete confidence  worf lets go  phaser on stun mr worf  we dont know the situation dont take chances   agreed sir  now remember  in a nearwarp transport the effects may be unusual   what do you mean  youll see   energize  wait i dont understand  you do now  for a moment i thought i was stuck in that wall  for a moment you were   data to enterprise  i read you commander go ahead  we are inside gravess home  all is quiet but no one knew we were coming  use caution but protect gravess health at all costs  understood sir i suggest we see if anyone is home  no need commander  you heard me thank god  im kareen brianon dr gravess assistant  were from the enterprise  we monitored your call but you never acknowledged us  sorry i couldnt take the chance  chance what chance  the chance i might find out someone was coming  kareen knew i would not be pleased to put it mildly  i had no choice i refuse to just watch you deteriorate   what symptoms have you noticed  pain shortness of breath   irritability  ridiculous  im as healthy as a rigelian ox  hes not himself believe me his temper is out of control   nonsense  ira  i am a doctor lt selar  no offence but i dont want you touching me  i dont like people much and i like doctors even less  i thought most doctors were people  youre wrong ask any patient  though for a doctor youre not a badlooking woman  what have we got here another lovely specimen of womanhood  i thought you didnt like people  women arent people theyre women  im deanna troi its an honour to meet you  of course this is one of the great moments of your life  excuse me sir are you a romulan   hardly  hes a klingon kareen  kareens lived here since her father died when she was young  i taught her all she knows of unhuman races  klingons and romulans dont look much alike kareen  even though they act much alike  must i stand here and be insulted  no insult intended mr klingon  you see doctor theres nothing wrong with my hearing  my  lt cmdr data  absolutely no aesthetic value whatsoever looks like soongs work  correct did you know dr soong  know him i taught him everything he knows  you could say that i was the father of his work  which kinda makes me your grandfather sonny  damn doctors always sneaking up on one  attacking from the rear  go on gorgeous spit it out  whatever it is i can take it  ive checked twice to make certain  you have darnays disease  im sorry dr graves its in its final stage  cant you do something for him  in all cases darnays is terminal  captains log stardate 424377  weve repaired the stricken liner constantinople  mostly minor  they have been treated and supplied with medicines  we are heading back to gravesworld at speed   i have noticed doctor  call me grandpa  seems more touching in my final hours  i have noticed grandpa  that you keep repeating a musical phrase i am unfamiliar with  its an ancient little tune called if i only had a heart  a plaintive lament sung by a mechanical man  who longs to be human its his only wish   what happens to him  he finds out hes human after all  always was just worried so much he never realized it  a happy ending the mechanical man gets his wish  stories often have happy endings  its life that throws you for a loop  it must be so hard for you to be so close to being human  and yet never really knowing what its like to know pain  but  pain is unpleasant is it not  pain lust  envy  pleasure  desire  do you know what desire is data  desire to long for to crave a wish a request  do you know what desire is  no i do not suppose i will ever really know  i feel pity for you  your existence must be a kind of walking purgatory  neither dead nor alive never really feeling anything  just existing  listen to me  a dying man takes the time to mourn a man who will never know death  funny isnt it  funny  i have had great difficulty determining what funny is  ive had the same difficulty most of my life  were much alike  id say he has a week thats an estimate  the disease attacks the brain and nervous system  we can expect more erratic behaviour of the kind youve noticed  his feelings towards you are very warm  he is attracted to you in many ways  attracted  i know ive felt certain feelings from him and for him  had i been older perhaps we could have been  thats not the way it worked out  and now its like hes afraid to face me  the only one he talks to is your friend data  you mentioned your impending death grandpa  you face it with remarkable courage and stoicism  that is because i am an incredible man  possessing an iron will and nerves of steel  two traits that have helped me become the genius i am today  and the ladykiller i was in days gone by  you condone homicide sir  its an expression data  it means i was once as beautiful as i am smart   really grandpa  no not really  but what the hell im dying  i can remember my life any way i want  but ill let you into a little secret sonny  i dont really believe i will be dying   but the doctor  ill die  but i wont really be dead  you see i believe ive learned  to transfer the wealth of my knowledge into a computer  before i die i plan to transfer my great intellect into this machine  thus cheating the grim reaper of his greatest prize  but what would you know of death  it is a subject forever alien to you  that is not necessarily true i do have an off button if you will  its activation robs me of my consciousness  therefore rendering me dead  i do not enjoy contemplating it  i can understand that  just where would soong position such a device dont tell me  let me guess  captain to away team were standing by  i do not wish to interrupt data and the doctor  they have a rapport but the enterprise is in orbit  id like to transfer graves to the ship  that will not be necessary doctor he is gone  gone  it happened a few moments ago in my arms  ira graves is dead  captains log supplemental  i leave gravesworld with the knowledge  that our mission was unsuccessful  whatever scientific secrets ira graves was about to unlock  have been lost for ever  our priority is to reach a star base  so that gravess assistant can get on with her life  why didnt you contact dr selar  when you saw that he was beginning to go  it would have been pointless all things must pass   may i go now sir  yes of course  we will try to honour him  in the manner in which he specified  i said we would data  i am glad sir it was his dying wish  hello data its good to see you again  the stars are so beautiful from space  you always did love the sky  a stargazer that is what you are  did ira tell you that  i guess hes right  i used to spend hours just lying on a hill looking up  ira never told you how beautiful you were to him  he never told you did he  he could not tell you do you understand  yes i understand  but he wanted to  every waking moment  he wanted you to know that  you were everything to him  he was a fine man  a man of rare gifts  and great accomplishments  he will be sorely missed  anyone else have anything to say  i have a few words to say sir  just look at that face  the face of a thinker  a warrior  a man  for all seasons  yes ira graves was all that and more  but he was not perfect  perhaps his greatest flaw was that he was too selfless  he cared too much for his fellow man  with nary a thought for himself  a man of limitless accomplishments  and unbridled modesty  i can safely say that to know him was to love him  and to love him  was to know him  those who knew him loved him   while those who did not know him  loved him from afar   data  im almost finished sir  you are finished  we now commit the body of ira graves to the timeless depths of space  i am sorry sir  perhaps my admiration for grandpa got the best of me  grandpa  that is how i think of him my only living relative no longer living  data  i was only trying to carry out his wishes sir  i wanted to keep my promise to him  i know that data look i realise youve been studying  the human equation with great alacrity  but perhaps youve been working at it too much  dont try so hard to be human just be yourself  alright  yes sir i will work on staying within myself  grand  youre dismissed mr data  thank you sir  captains personal log  data has assured me that his odd behaviour will return to normal  but i think something went wrong on gravesworld  im still concerned captain ive never seen him act like this  could it be the grandfather analogy that graves planted in his head  data is an orphan in a manner of speaking  is it possible that the loss of graves might have affected him  touched him on some emotional level we didnt know he possessed  i hope youre right  i hope thats all it is  that was a great speech data  to know him is to love him is to know him  verbal composition at its most sophisticated level  your childlike mind cannot appreciate the wisdom of my words  childlike mind  when you get to be my age you will understand  your age  data chronologically youre not much older than i am  you are only as old as you feel try to remember that boy  are you turning into a philosopher  i am many things scholar artist philosopher   lover genius  data whats wrong with you  how beautiful  i thought youd enjoy the bridge  im aware of your interest in science  im aware of your interest in her  what was that commander  nothing sir nothing at all  these are the science stations  from the command centre we have control of the science stations  data what are you doing  i detest hypocrisy i wish they would just admit it  admit what mr data  that your interest in kareen is not purely professional  try as you will you cannot win her heart  she does not care for older men  or men of limited intellect  mr data you will come with me now do you understand me  i understand i understand all too well  removing the competition will not help you picard  excuse me   do you know what that was about  jealousy  intense burning jealousy  a human emotion and it was coming from data  if you wish to apologize i am prepared to listen  you expect me to apologize to you  you were a bit rude to me  might make you feel better if you said you were sorry  data something is wrong with your circuitry  ridiculous im as healthy as a rigelian ox  i wish i could believe that  i would accompany you to sickbay but i doubt if that would help  sickbay   are you ill captain  im getting there  ill have engineering run a full physical on you  that will not be necessary i can run a circuit check on myself  it will immediately determine any abnormalities  do it thats an order  as i expected i am fine could not be better  for the first time since ive known you i dont believe you  try and hold still will you data  data wait for me in the corridor  why should i this concerns me more than you  you will wait for me in the corridor  his insubordination is growing by leaps and bounds  i could use discipline but id rather try and help him  i wish i knew what to suggest i cant find a thing wrong with him  perhaps were looking in the wrong place   meaning  if his physical health is good  perhaps his mental health should be addressed  are you saying datas losing his mind  with your permission captain there is a way to find out  you remember the psychotronicstability examination  we all had to take it before graduating  it was a waste of time then its a waste of time now  it will gauge your reactions to the images it projects  watch the screen and let your mind go blank  the device will do the rest  its safe to say that youre his best friend  is it possible to speculate about whats happening to him  well sir its just a guess but  sometimes he wants to be human so badly he can taste it  i think he gets confused when his human qualities surface  go on  witnessing gravess death may have been a catalyst for the  i have the test results i ran them several times to be sure  to be sure of what  there are two disparate personalities within lt cmdr data  each distinctly different a dominant and a recessive  hes an android is that possible  it must be the dominant personality is unstable  brilliant but vain sensitive yet paranoid  i believe it is prone to irrationality  of course   sir  nothing go on  it seems to have an especially strong hatred of you captain  or to a lesser degree any authority figure  and the worst part is its growing  how do you mean  the alien persona is getting stronger  and gobbling up what is left of the weaker ego the data we know  if something isnt done to stop it immediately   we will lose our data for ever  captains personal log we have arrived at star base 6  where miss brianon will await transport back to earth  i am greatly troubled by cmdr datas behaviour  and fear it is related to the experiments of ira graves   where is data  he should be in his quarters  you ordered him not to leave  tell me where is lt cmdr data  current location tenforward  lt worf will you go to tenforward and keep an eye on data  dont interfere with his actions unless you hear from me  worf here sir acknowledged  i want to know more about what happened on gravesworld  lt selar report to the captains ready room  hello kareen dont you think its time we stopped pretending  you know who i am  youre data  you do know who i am  ira  it is me i am here  i am alive  how  i deactivated data and transferred my mind into his frame  i never imagined how much of myself i would retain  my feelings my dreams  they wont let you get away with it theyll try to stop you  how can they it is my body now it is out of their hands  how much time did data spend with graves  most of the time we were there   always alone  yes always  doctor what was your impression of graves  he seemed brilliant egocentric arrogant chauvinistic  sound familiar  something wonderful has happened  i can take a deep breath now without feeling stabbing pain  i will never have to face death again  think what i will accomplish over the next 1000 years  what  i know what youre thinking there is no need to worry  i will create an android body for you too  we can witness the end of time together  why are you crying kareen i can love you now  the way i always wanted to  it was not right before  i was too old for you too weak  now i can be everything you want me to be  i wont let you put me in a machine i want to live my life  i wont let you take it away from me  ira youre hurting me  worf to capt picard  data has left tenforward   should i follow  negative ill handle this  he was an expert in cybernetics  yes  our memorial service may have been premature  what an achievement  so long as men can breathe or eyes can see  so long lives this  and this gives life to thee  he was working on bridging the gap between man and machine  it seems he built that bridge i may be forced to tear it down  i can hear you coming captain  my ears are better than the average dogs you know  i know who you are and what youve done  of course you do  i came here to talk to data  i cannot allow that  i understand your desperation  the shock of learning you were dying  but you had no right to do what you have done  i had every right captain i am man he is machine  there is no question who must live and what must die  what of data  data  before me he was nothing  just a walking tin can with circuits for intestines  pathetic without heart a man is meaningless  i would not come up if i were you captain i might not like it  you are most fortunate my dear captain  that i am not a violent man  not a violent man  this is not my fault  they told me i should not be here they should not have done that  graves listen to me  no one denies the significance of your transformation  but i dont believe this was part of your plan  encountering data was mere coincidence  one that offered you more than you could have dreamed  but something has gone wrong look here  this experiment must be terminated  this is idiotic   picard to sickbay  yes captain  how is miss brianon  her left hand is fractured in two places weve begun treatment  im afraid there are two more injuries in engineering  im on my way  whos next  these were all accidents i did not intend  how many more accidents you must leave this body  no i live here now  every man has his time every man without exception  but youve cheated  you have extended your life at the expense of another  graves give data back give him back   data is dead  no  he must not be lost hes not simply an android  hes a life form entirely unique  data is not human he is  he is different yes  that does not make him expendable or any less significant  no being is so important  that he can usurp anothers rights set him free  no  how many  how many more accidents   data where is he  just take it easy  i cant afford to take it easy doctor  tell me where is lt cmdr data  data can you hear me   geordi  yeah   may i ask a question  i think you just did  correct then may i ask another question after this one  you can ask me anything you want  why am i on the floor in an undignified position  with you four standing over me with expressions of  ive heard more than enough youre you again  captain look at this  hes in there ira put himself in the computer  captains log supplemental we said goodbye to kareen  hoping that her future will be bright  the intellect of ira graves is now in our computer  there is knowledge but no consciousness  the human equation has been lost   you dont remember anything  not a thing  to know him is to love him is to know him  perhaps it is best that i do not remember  i trust i did nothing unbecoming to a starfleet officer  does wrestling with a klingon targ ring a bell  mr crusher take us out of orbit  aye sir  did i win
