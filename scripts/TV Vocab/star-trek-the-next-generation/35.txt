                sir we are approaching klavdia iii   take us to impulse power  aye sir impulse power   bridge engineering  yes lieutenant  out of warp id like to use this time  to make some routine adjustments were overdue   how long will that take  a couple of hours sir  proceed lt la forge standard orbit ensign  wes i need an scm model 3 from ships stores can you handle that   right away  alright  magnify mr worf  hardly an inviting planet even for a research establishment  i would have thought daled iv would send a future leader  to a more hospitable environment  for some security is more important than comfort   yes but 16 years  captain were being hailed   hailing frequencies mr worf  open  this is capt picard of the uss enterprise  i am anya  the troposphere is distorting our signal   can you clean it up mr worf  ill try now  this is picard of the enterprise please will you repeat your message  i am anya have you come for salia of daled iv  that is correct   what species are you  human  excellent  bring us aboard that is all  friendly isnt she  friendly or not salia has the rank of head of state  so lets treat them accordingly  number one mr worf lets go greet our visitors   you have the bridge mr data  aye sir  welcome to the enterprise im capt picard  this is salia of daled iv  i didnt feel a thing is that normal when one is transported  yes it is  may i see your matterenergy conversion controls  of course  i can arrange a tour of the ship   id love that  that will not be necessary  just show us to our quarters capt picard  very well  your quarters are normally reserved for starfleet admiralty  thats a superconducting magnet isnt it  yeah its an scm model how did you know that  study for the last 16 years ive  please salia walk ahead with me  be careful those can rip the iron out of your blood cells  commander who is she  i think shes a governess  no the girl  i dont know if shell have time for you wes  shes destined to rule an entire world  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  come in  you wanted to see me  yes data the girl who came on board  salia of daled iv  who is she  little is known she was born on daled iv  to parents from opposite sides in a centuriesold civil war  both died shortly after her birth  a federation ship brought her and her governess to klavdia iii  to raise her in a neutral environment  and now shes returning  it is hoped she will unite the factions and bring peace  ensign crusher report are you alright   yeah im fine i just  were waiting for that magnet  im on my way  captain weve laid in a course for daled iv  well remain on impulse power until lt la forge finishes his adjustments  mr worf did the quarters meet with our passengers approval  i doubt anything meets with that womans approval sir  captain im concerned about our new passengers  their emotions do not fit who they are and what theyre doing  do you suggest theyre not who they say they are  actually its more like theyre not what they say they are  picard to salias quarters   yes  may we turn on the viewer  yes of course   are your quarters satisfactory  yes very  tell me captain who was the young man i met before  that was ensign wesley crusher  thank you for checking on us  i only hope our quarters on daled iv will be this luxurious  please feel free to contact me at any time picard out  what i sensed hasnt changed  what puzzles me is how she is expected to bring peace to daled iv  its inhabitants have fought throughout their history  what do we know about the cause of these wars  only that it is the difference between night and day  data you used a colloquialism  did i  what i meant is that daled iv rotates only once per revolution  so one side is constantly dark and the other is constantly light  one might surmise that the two have developed disparate cultures  which is a major cause of most wars  this child is supposed to bring them together  she seems too delicate for such a task  do not be fooled by her looks  the body is just a shell  how can i be a leader if i dont know anything about my people  youll lead because you were accepted by both sides   and because it is in your blood  what is expected of me there   you will know  how  you just will  salia you must arrive with an open mind  without preconceived ideas of what you will find  or the people on either side  its very frustrating  you feel the weight of so much responsibility  youre not sure youll live up to the expectations  its not only that  nobody even asked me if this is something i want  it is your duty  and i have no choice  it wont be as bad as you think  in fact it could be quite wonderful  besides  you are the last and only chance  wont i need more than instinct  to do whatever is expected of me on daled iv  energy depletion level  04 percent and increasing  wesley have you found that defocused area yet  im looking  yeah i see the way youre looking  what  sorry ive got my mind on something  i can see that  its this girl they beamed up shes perfect absolutely perfect  now i know why you cant concentrate   ill do better  ok  warning resonant field applied   what is it what happened  nothing  i had it on the wrong setting  i suppose it had to happen it usually does at this age  what usually does  glands erupting with hormones it happens to all of us  just because i said i think shes interesting  you said she was perfect  come down youre no use here for now  come on down from there go talk to her use the ladder  thats silly geordi  but since you recommended it how should i approach her   what should i say  hi im wesley crusher   id like to talk to you  and then what  whatever occurs to you   what if nothing does  i dont have time for this   youll have to ask somebody else  ok  that is how the klingon lures a mate   are you telling me to yell at her  no men do not roar  women roar  then they hurl heavy objects  and claw at you  what does the man do  he reads love poetry  he ducks a lot  worf sounds like it works great for klingons  but i think i need to try something a little less dangerous  then go to her door beg like a human  it should be that simple wesley judging by her appearance  it is likely you are biologically compatible  you may lack histocompatibility of the cell membrane but  data  i want to meet her not dissect her   picard to salias quarters  yes captain  may i activate the view screen  hurry go  certainly  weve invited anya to take a tour of the ship   maybe youd like to join her  very much  your escort will be with you shortly picard out  i think ill go on the tour  why cant i  this is the only chance ill ever have to see a vessel like this  no you must remain here where it is safe  salia do an old woman a favour and obey me for the rest of this trip  you are no more an old woman than i am a leader  yes come in  im here to escort you on your tour  salia will remain behind i will be right there  you are a leader  and i am older than you could ever imagine  what should i say how do i act what do i do  guinan could you step over here  sounds simple enough  your first words are the most important  you may want to start like this  you are the most beautiful woman in the galaxy  but that might not work  yes it would   ive longed to tell you that  but you were afraid of me   of us of what we might become  commander   or that youd think it was a line  maybe i do think its a line  you think im not sincere  i didnt say that its a nice line like a knock at the door   youre inviting me in  im not sending you away   thats more than i expected  is it all you hoped  to hope is to recognize the possibility i had only dreams   dreams can be dangerous  not these  i dream of a galaxy where your eyes are the stars  and the universe worships the night  careful putting me on a pedestal you may not be able to reach me  then ill learn how to fly  you are the heart in my day and the soul in my night  i dont think this is my style  shut up kid  tell me more about my eyes  this is the dilithium crystal chamber  our chief engineer geordi la forge  what is that what are you doing  nothing to be concerned about just some routine adjustments  i wasnt aware that the deuterium control conduit required adjustment  i run periodic inspections on all engineering systems   and youve found a malfunction  its not a malfunction  just a minute defocused area it lowers operating efficiency   it may also produce excess prions  our computer would detect that  unless of course it too is malfunctioning  look i really have to get this finished  please come with me  i will be back to check your progress  ensign crusher what can i do for you  nothing   is there a problem  no  can you show me how to work the food dispenser  sure  really its quite simple  you tell the computer what you want and it prepares it for you  what should i order  i dont know what do you like  id like something sweet  i know  computer thalian chocolate mousse  its a wonderful sensation  on thalos vii they age the beans 400 years   youve been there  its one of my favourite places  it must be fun to visit a planet like that  its the best part of being on the enterprise  ive studied about some of them but to see them would be wonderful  tell me about the other places youve been  theres too many  the only world ive known is klavdia iii  its about time we changed that  how  come with me  ill be with you in a moment   whats wrong with him  andronesian encephalitis  that disease is contagious  very unlikely our airfiltering system  but there is a chance  if you mean mathematically yes the probability is not zero  i cannot rely on your primitive technologies kill the patient  what  destroy the patient immediately  now you calm down  if you wont take action then i will  security to sickbay hurry  wait hold your fire  worf  what is she keep her away  do not interfere  she wants to kill hennesey  his disease threatens salia  captain there is no chance of contagion   the situation is under control  thats not good enough  well it will have to be  your powers are infinitesimal compared to mine  yes that may be but you will obey my orders  you will remain in your quarters and in your present form  for the rest of this voyage is that clear   very  keep her under guard  aye sir  wait for me   what kind of creature is she  ive never seen anything like her  there is mention in the galactic zoological catalogue  of a species called allasomorph  which possess the power to alter their molecular structure  into other life forms  such a creature would make a perfect protector  i want a security team stationed outside sickbay  aye sir captain what if anya transforms  improvise  can a place so remarkable truly exist  yes there are many more  all of them are different  ive learned about them  thats all i did on klavdia iii was learn  i know so much  but ive seen so little  think of all you have to look forward to  this is a great time to be alive   for you  for both of us  this is all just beginning  weve only charted 19 of our galaxy the rest is out there just waiting  look what weve already discovered  i have never seen anything so wondrous  wait  computer rousseau v  its breathtaking  and youve been to this place  someday youll visit rousseau v  and many other places all more spectacular  if only it were possible  listen   what is it  in a moment  the resonance from the neutrino clouds will become synchronous  its so beautiful  its like this place has a voice and is trying to speak to us  thank you for sharing all this with me  someday youll see it for yourself  look over there  remain here you are restricted to quarters  for the remainder of this voyage  you are the protector of this ship are you not  i am in charge of security  you must understand my duties as well  if you confine me to this cell i cannot protect salia  there is no need for concern she is safe on this ship  you must understand that i cannot make such an assumption  you havent any choice   you must trust me to protect her  no  a protector cannot have two charges your responsibility is to the ship  my duty is to salia  my responsibility to the ship includes protecting salia  you know im stronger than you  i was unprepared  you underestimated me in your sickbay that is usually fatal  still you are here confined to your room  i ceased my struggle by choice not because of you or your captain  i would have stopped you if not me someone else  no you cannot control me  we will see  weve brought a very dangerous life form on board  i want to minimize the chance of any incident  whatever life form anya is emotionally shes salias mother  the most dangerous animal is a mother protecting her young   exactly  captain this is anya   yes  salia is gone where is she  this has all been so wonderful im not even sure its real  believe me tenforward isnt an illusion  not that  i mean the way i feel  you wont find a better dish of chocolate anywhere  im sure i wont  is something wrong  ive had a great time being with you wesley  and that makes you sad  when i was on klavdia iii  all i could think about was leaving that isolation  it makes me sad having to face it again  after seeing what else is possible  is that what awaits you on daled iv isolation  i thought you were going there to reunite two warring parties  what else do you know  very little the ships computer doesnt have that much on daled iv  how will you stop the fighting  im not certain i only know i will have many responsibilities  your language has no word for the position ill hold  in many ways ill have even less freedom than on klavdia iii  you could stay   on the enterprise  why not  because i cant  just because a girl runs out  doesnt mean she doesnt wish you to follow  what is it what happened  stay away from me  im sorry  i dont understand  i cant stay here  i cant have this life  i want it more than anything but i cant have it  salia nothing is impossible  not for you  theres a way i know there is  leave her alone  ensign step away from her  come with me  energy depletion level  zero   la forge to bridge  yes lieutenant  ive completed my final adjustments thanks for the time   warp engines are now available  very good  number one get us to daled as quickly as possible  ensign gibson go to warp 88   warp 88 sir  estimated time  three hours nine minutes  crusher when youre done in engineering report to my ready room   yes sir  take the bridge number one  aye sir  the woman anya is not what she appears to be  she is an allasomorph  a shapeshifter  shes not only a governess shes also the girls protector  now i dont care to interfere  in the personal relationships of those under my command  but in this case  you want me to stay away from salia  yes i do for the good of the ship and the safety of everyone on board  i will do as you ask  why wont you let me have a friend  it is my duty to protect you from danger  theres no danger here  there is always danger from one who is not your kind  salia hes confusing you remember your responsibilities  whether or not i see wesley is for me to decide  it is not  i raised you i protected you  and i intend to deliver you to daled iv  maybe what you want doesnt matter any more  salia please  i know its difficult for you  but you must do what youre destined to do   standard orbit  aye sir  hailing frequencies mr worf  captain im encountering the same interference as on klavdia iii  the troposphere must be distorting our signals  it is fascinating captain  klavdia iii and daled iv have almost identical atmospheres  magnify times 20  how could anyone exist  in an environment so totally hostile toward human life  mr data override the interference lets complete our mission  come in   you shouldnt have come  you want me to leave   i didnt say that  then you want me to stay   does anya know youre here  that doesnt matter  im glad you came i thought anya would keep you with her   i have certain rights  so you slipped out  while she was asleep i hope you didnt get trouble from your captain  no i havent gotten in trouble yet   anya thought you would corrupt me  with my wild way of life  maybe  with the normal things people do when they like each other   wesley get out of here  whats going on   just go  security crew quarters   you should not have disobeyed me  i had to  i warned you to leave her alone  captains log stardate 425688  since anyas powers enabled her to escape her guards unnoticed  we have sealed her quarters with a force field  that will contain her no matter how small a form she may take   im receiving an audio signal  audio on  enterprise this is command headquarters of daled iv   we have been expecting you  sir the communication originated  from a terawatt source on the planet  thats more power than our entire ship could generate  it is needed to penetrate the atmosphere  which means we lack the ability to respond sir  sir beamdown coordinates are encoded in the carrier signal  splendid  ill arrange for our guests to beam down  force field off  come in  we have arrived  salia will be with you in just a moment   youre not going  no  my duties have been completed  i have done all that i could  i hope it was enough  youve raised me well and i thank you for that  i would not have harmed the boy i only wanted to frighten him  i know  you are ready for what awaits you and you will do well  i know ive been hard on you  but i wanted to prepare you for anything you might have to do  will i ever be able to leave daled iv  probably not  but anything is possible  thats what wes said  i hope hes right  where will you go  the third moon is within range of these transporters ill go there  it was my home before we went away  im going to miss you  i know  i am ready now  i will escort you to transporter room six  you will be happy to see me leave  no you are a worthy opponent  thank you at heart we are very much alike  yes we are  perhaps we shall fight again  on the same side  it would be an honour  shall we go  come in  wesley i have to go now  was it fun  what do you mean  playing humanoid was it fun  wesley look at me  right now this minute this is what i am a humanoid girl  what are you really   does it matter  yes  our natural state is unlike anything you can imagine  so you took this form for our benefit  thats why you asked what species we are  im sorry i hurt you i didnt mean to  i loved you  i love you too  can you  yes  i have the same feelings the same emotions as you  you must believe me  please go  wesley lets not say goodbye like this  prepare to beam salia to the specified coordinates  our world is grateful for the courtesy you have extended  i hope someday the federation and daled iv will have formal contact  that is my wish as well   coordinates input sir  proceed  wait  a taste to remember me by  i wish there was something i could give you  you already have  im glad you came to say goodbye  thank you for everything   i want you to leave now  why  i cannot arrive on my planet in this form  and i want you to remember me as i am now  dont worry i will  energize  seeing her on the transporter pad it was like seeing pure light  i miss her  i feel empty  i know that sensation  but therell come a time when all you remember is the love  im never going to feel this way about anyone else  youre right  i didnt expect you to say that  therell be others but every time you feel love itll be different  every time its different  knowing that doesnt make it any easier  its not supposed to
