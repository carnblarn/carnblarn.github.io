                captains log stardate 426091  in response to a desperate plea  from my old friend capt donald varley of the uss yamato  im running a grave risk  by taking the enterprise into the neutral zone  dangerous malfunctions have been plaguing our sister ship  perhaps if both crews work together we can eliminate the problems  before our presence is detected by the romulans  how long to rendezvous mr crusher  four minutes and 33 seconds sir  status of download mr data  the yamato log should be in our computer by rendezvous  have you nailed down our hiccup   sir  the odd reading  no sir it might be due to problems being experienced by the yamato  trouble number one  im not sure are we alone out here worf  yes there are no other vessels except the yamato  which is coming into visual range now  at last   transmission from the yamato sir  on viewer  whats a nice captain doing in a place like this  its good to see you again despite your antique humour  i hope your people can help us  malfunctions are becoming serious  we lost an engineering team  when a computer shut down a force field in a shuttle bay   any idea what caused this sir  none they affect every system simultaneously  its like the ship decided to fall apart  maybe we should have run these galaxyclass ships  across more drawing boards before we built one  you believe its a design flaw  i dont know im grasping at straws  we must fix it before i lose more than an engineering team  do you wish to evacuate any nonessential personnel sir  no that would be premature  well get our teams to work on it immediately  im not comfortable sitting around in the neutral zone  i know youre wondering what the hell im doing here  well i heard rumours about a couple of archaeological digs  that made the iconians sound a lot less like legend  i did a little investigating and i located their home world  in the neutral zone  in the neutral zone  that was quite a risk to run to satisfy archaeological curiosity  the risk would be in allowing the romulans to locate iconia  fortunately i got there first  its a virtually dead planet  enough technology remains to give the romulans an edge if they find  your transmission is breaking up  mr data try and clean that up  sir there is an energy buildup in the yamatos engineering section  yamato this is the enterprise  yamato come in  magnetic seals in the antimatter chamber are decaying  captain  donald come in  shields up  sir  sensors indicate no life reading sir  captain another vessel is coming within sensor range  it is romulan  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  captains log supplemental  the yamatos entire crew and their families  more than 1000 people have been lost  circumstances unfortunately permit us no pause for grief  no response from the romulan vessel  arm phasers and prepare to lock on target  did they attack the yamato  unknown sir  their weapon systems have been fully activated still no response  romulan vessel this is capt jeanluc picard of the enterprise  capt picard  explain your illegal presence in the neutral zone  explain yours  are you responsible for the destruction of the yamato  no  but believe me had we exercised our right to defend the neutral zone  we would not have stopped with one starship  you will leave at once   mute  comments   shes extremely anxious  she just destroyed a starship  your scan was inconclusive we dont know what happened  our presence here is provocative it could force her to respond   open  we will comply  when i know the cause of the destruction of the yamato  and i am satisfied you were not responsible picard out   their cloaking device is engaged  good  they cant fire  unless they have overcome that deficiency  the yamato was destroyed while they were cloaked  enough i want answers not conjecture  number one i want them at a meeting in one hour  aye sir  sensors reveal that what we saw was an uncontrolled  and catastrophic matterantimatter mix  the magnetic seals between the chambers collapsed and  wait thats not possible  it is but a highly improbable set of circumstances has to take place  explain  ok in the event of a breach of seal integrity  theres a release system which dumps the antimatter  such a dump began was halted and the containment seals were dropped  there was enough antimatter present to lead to an explosion  there is no evidence of weapon use  no sir none  however it happened the yamato did it to herself  theorize  what could have caused such a catastrophic malfunction  capt varley may have been right there may be a design flaw  in a galaxyclass starship  yes sir its the most sophisticated machine ever built  maybe something was overlooked  knowing where the flaw is located can you isolate it and solve it  were already working on it sir  pull any personnel you can use  if we have established that the romulans  were not behind the destruction of the yamato  would it not be prudent to withdraw  if it is a design flaw were better to stay where we are  and give geordi time to work on it  or what happened to the yamato could happen to us  computer access capt donald varleys personal log  search parameter  locate entries containing words romulan andor iconian  working  personal log  it was kind of dr ramsey to allow me to take my own piece of legend  from the archaeological dig at denius iii  my engineers have examined it  but are completely baffled by its technology  what was its purpose  im like a caveman confronted by a tricorder  im certain this device is iconian  but how far had it travelled before it was abandoned  on this alien world  personal log  a galactic rosetta stone  the star fields on the artifact were unintelligible  until i took into account  after that it was easy to pinpoint iconia  my first officer is questioning my order to violate the neutral zone  but im convinced ive taken the only proper course  should this technology fall into the hands of the romulans  we might as well dock our ships and defend ourselves with sticks  personal log weve been spotted by a romulan cruiser  after playing hideandseek through several solar systems  i think ive managed to elude them  the iconian probe scan  was it an attempt at communication  if only i knew what we were dealing with here  personal log  i cant send a team to the surface of iconia or scan its energy source  because of these maddening systems failures  its infuriating to be stopped at the threshold of a dream by my own ship  were leaving orbit to rendezvous with picard  if he cant help us repair the yamato  i must convince him to continue this exploration  the future wellbeing of the federation may well depend on it  no further entries conforming to search parameters  mr data  theres a reference in varleys log to a probe that scanned the yamato  aye sir we have a visual record  put it on main viewer  what the devil is that  have you seen anything like that before  no sir it appears to be a scanner possibly a transmitter   transmitting what  unknown sir  engineering  la forge  any progress on the matterantimatter scan  everything continues to check out now analyzing the magnetic coils  when the yamato was probed where was she  in orbit around a planet at coordinates 227 mark 359  eta at warp factor eight   sir that would put us close to the romulan side of the neutral zone  cant be helped lay in a course   warp factor eight  aye sir   well assume the yamatos mission  and risk a war  perhaps prevent one  come  sir may i speak with you a moment  yes of course  well what is it wesley  its about the iconians sir  i was told they were just a myth  china was thought to be a myth until marco polo went there  the iconians are certainly real sit down  we know that three systems within this sector  had several cultural similarities which could only be explained  by there being a unifying influence  so they colonized those worlds  probably conquered   you mean they were warlike  perhaps  ancient texts did speak of demons of air and darkness  air and darkness  legend has it that they travelled without the benefit of spaceships  merely appearing out of thin air on distant planets  sounds like magic  well we would appear magical to stone age people  how did you find this out  archaeology has been a hobby of mine since academy days  but why dont we talk about what really brought you here  its the yamato captain  i cant stop thinking about her  all those people   dead  i dont know how you and cmdr riker and geordi  how you handle it so easily  easily  no not easily  we handle it because were trained to   as you will be  tea earl grey hot  but if ever the time comes  when the death of a single individual fails to move us   didnt you order tea sir  now that should not have happened  captains log supplemental as happened to our sister ship  the enterprise is experiencing a series of system failures  so far they are random  but they could be early symptoms of what happened to the yamato   engineering  la forge  any progress on solving our problems  no but i can eliminate one worry it is not a design flaw  reviewing the yamato logs  i think that probe had something to do with their problems   how  i need to see the thing  if it was the probe that explains the yamato  but how do you explain the enterprises difficulties  i cant  are our problems likely to attain the seriousness of the yamatos  if youre asking for speculation id say yes i need time  mr la forge time is one thing we do not have in abundance  analysis mr data  scanning sir   well mr data  no lifeform readings sir  all major cities have been damaged  the destruction is consistent with largescale orbital bombardment  how long ago  approximately 200000 years sir  there is an energy source in the smaller continents mountains  magnify  is that iconia  capt varley died believing that it was  did you see that  projectile launched from the planet surface  its size and composition match the probe which scanned the yamato  shields up prepare a tractor beam  mr la forge im going to assist you in your research  a probe has been launched from iconia  im going to capture it  no sir wait  captain  bridge  emergency stop  stop damn it  tractor beam ready sir   geordi are you alright  destroy the probe sir quickly  worf target phasers   phasers locked on target  fire  welcome to the bridge mr la forge  thank you sir if that thing had managed to scan us  wed have had no chance of saving the enterprise  that probe was transmitting an alien computer program  that program is now on the enterprise trying to rewrite our software  we have two completely incompatible computer systems trying to interact  thats why our instruments are so erratic   yes  what can you do  not much the iconian program is so sophisticated i may never crack it  consider captain this program has entered an alien database ours  in less than seven hours it has learned our systems  and begun to reprogram our computer  the earlier probe was responsible for the yamatos destruction  yes only in as much as it was the probe that transmitted the program  we werent scanned by that probe how did it get aboard the enterprise  we downloaded the yamato log and in that log was the program  why didnt we suffer the same fate  the program affected the yamatos systems simultaneously  here it was deposited within a specific section of our mainframe  it has to work its way out it gives us some breathing space  not much  injury reports are increasing too sir  dr pulaski does not trust the turbo lifts  she is sending her teams through access tunnels  the enterprise computer is a lot like our own bodies  with voluntary and involuntary systems  this ship is done automatically  completely out of our control  were sitting on a bomb that could go off any second or maybe never  the biobeds arent working the ship is falling apart  ive had 35 emergency calls scattered across 12 decks  my trauma teams are being run ragged trying to respond  biobeds   dr pulaski  yes  ive got a problem here the knitter isnt working  try a splint   doctor  splint its an ancient concept  you take two flat pieces of wood or plastic a bandage   the broken limb is kept immobile  thats not practising medicine  yes it is its a timehonoured way  with your head your heart and your hands so jump to it  damn  try a bypass on the shieldcontrol interface  no go let me see if i can directly access the master program   what happened  any answer would be speculation  this is yet another example of how our actions have random results  thanks data i noticed  life support has failed on decks seven and 13 sir  what if this thing can rewrite our entire system  its so far beyond our understanding never mind our control  our own ignorance could kill us  we may never  we may never reach that point  a variation of what happened to the yamato may destroy us first  so we sit and watch our ship disintegrate around us  the probe was launched from iconia  probably from an automated system  there may be records near the launch site  that could help us find a solution   ill arrange an away team  and ill lead it   you will lead it  yes  weve had this conversation a hundred times  and we will have it again i have studied the iconians i have to go  the enterprise is yours  for as long as she lasts  ive got a lock on the energy source and its working   but that could change  were aware of the risks  energize  transport complete  stay sharp i want to be able to pull them out at a moments notice  aye sir   commander romulan vessel  open hailing frequencies   theyre arming torpedoes  shields up go to red alert   the shields arent responding  theyre preparing to fire  mr crusher i need those shields   im trying sir  theyre firing  what happened  instead of firing they disarmed and cancelled  fate  protects fools little children and ships named enterprise  lock phasers on them and hold your fire   sir the shields are back up  impeccable timing  sir the shields are back down   phaser banks are down  shields are back up  another time and place this could be funny  status of torpedo banks  theyre down too  if we have to fight could you find me some rocks to throw  sir the romulan torpedoes are continuing to arm and disarm  perhaps its attempt to fire was unintentional   open hailing frequencies  open  romulan vessel this is cmdr william riker of the uss enterprise  why did you attempt to fire on us  this is subcommander taris of the haakona  why have you penetrated deeper into the neutral zone  why are you still here  i have claimed this planet for the romulan empire  this is the neutral zone no one can claim anything  withdraw or ill have to destroy your ship and your away team  what the hell  this is your final warning i will not  trouble with your systems commander  maybe we should consider postponing the war  until we solve our more immediate problem  youre stalling for time  sir another probe launched heading for the romulans   have we got our phasers back  no sir  taris if you have phaser capability prepare to use them now   what  destroy that probe  and not even a thank you  she is frustrated probably because her ship is as crippled as ours  why would the romulans be having problems they werent probed  they must have tapped into the yamato log  taris got more than she bargained for  maintain red alert  try to keep our shields up in case taris decides to act on her threat  commander  what about the away team with the shields up we cant beam them back  captains log supplemental  there is little left on the surface of iconia  but we have found a control centre which seems to have remained intact  come in enterprise  still no response sir  keep trying communications are bound to be erratic  i would not like to become a permanent resident of this planet  nor would l mr worf  scanners show no other life forms on the planet sir  i would not expect any  judging from the severity of the bombardment  i doubt any iconians survived  mr data lets see what sense we can make of this  aye sir   this is reminiscent of dinasian  yes sir  there are also similarities to dewan and iccobar  is it possible they form one language family beginning with iconian  it is sir  run a comparison using basic words from dinasian dewan and iccobar  see if we can reconstruct a common root language  accessing sir  youre jumpy  the tension on the ship is very high  any recommendation  give everyone something to do to focus their attention  alright  lets consider evacuation  for the planet  i know its probably impossible with taris sitting out there  but it would give everyone something to do  you go and organise it  you may need me if you have to negotiate with taris  ill manage  right now theyre more important  captain  your original hypothesis is correct  iconian is the parent tongue of a language family  consisting of iccobar dewan and dinasian  ive constructed an understanding through a comparison of root words  such as mother father child home tribe food life death yours  you know my interpretation of the signals will not be exact  yes lets get on with it  this appears to be manual override  that was not manual override  demons of air and darkness indeed   what is that  a gateway  these scenes could be holographic images  be careful   that was very foolish  but proves this is not a holograph  if i stepped through we could see if this is truly a gateway  no data you might not get back i cant risk losing you  this gate would seem to take us beyond the confines of this planet  is this how the iconians travelled  crossing light years as easily as we would cross a room  those places could be on worlds in distant corners of the galaxy  i think the iconians might have outfoxed their enemies  maybe they didnt all die in the bombardment  some of them could have passed through this  this is what varley feared   this is what he died for  sir  the romulans could use this technology as a weapon   like the iconians did  no i disagree  captain nothing here indicates this was a military command centre  perhaps a transporter room   the probe was hostile  we cant make that assumption  it devastated the yamato but what if it was by accident not design  what im going to say may sound unscientific  but standing on this soil breathing in this air  my instincts say we may have got them wrong  we do know the iconians were conquerors  only according to descendants of those who attacked this world  the victors invariably write history to their advantage  it is an unfortunate tendency in many cultures  to fear what they do not understand  its possible that their enemies confronted by this technology  may have attacked the iconians out of fear  sir  was that really the enterprise  i believe that it was  gentlemen we have a way home  captain there is a vast underground power source  which is controlled by this console  i believe my triggering of the gateway  has caused an upsurge in the power level  i have access  data can you hear me  data respond  captain   are you alright  no  i am damaged  how bad is it  the iconian program is attempting to rewrite my software  physical manifestations blindness motor cont  sir without him we have no hope of deciphering the program  captain the enterprise again  how long is the interval  about four minutes if the cycle holds  next time the enterprise appears go through it with data  geordi can learn from him maybe help him   we dont know if that is a gateway  this will be the test  aye sir  destroy the tricorder  it contains everything weve discovered up to this point  precisely why it must be destroyed  how long  about three minutes  im running out of time  we all are  data  i have to destroy this  this control room must not be allowed to fall into romulan hands  i understand sir  how how do i do it how do i destroy everything  the control room the probes all of it  the power source sir  i detonate it   but how how do i do that  the probes sir  probes the probes  launch i launch the probes  but why   what good will that do  the doors sir  doors  perhaps the probes are in a launch bay  if the doors are closed  the backwash from the rockets will overload the power bridge  yes  sir  the doors open automatically when the launch begins   and i will override  correct sir  which control keys damn  you cant see  help  worf help him up  describe please  im in front of the gate to my left there is a small triangular screen  right one meter  right  to my right is a larger screen the top is solid amber   the left red  correct  key  blue  amber amber  red  thats the launch sequence  how do i override the doors  blue blue blue  i hope thats not a stutter  i dont know what the delay is between launch and detonation  i wont key the launch sequence until youre through the gate  how long until the enterprise reappears  almost time captain   you will be killed   ill go through the gate  but where will you end up  very shortly anywhere will be preferable to this room  mr worf i am depending on you to get data back to the enterprise  he may be their only hope  aye sir   commander look  what happened wheres the captain  we must take data to engineering hopefully the captain will follow  i dont know how to help him comparing recorded norms  to these current readings shows all his functions are just going crazy  if we had an expert a maddox somebody  hes gone  what the hell   i am accessing  the selfcorrecting mechanism  captain  its kicking in to make minute adjustments in the positronic brain  i am on the enterprise how did i get here  he cleared the iconian program from his system how  i was on iconia now i am on the enterprise   this is critical how  give me a second to think  there was an incompatible program in datas system  the mechanism looked for a way to keep him alive the solution  the solution was a shutdown and a total wipe of affected memory   inquiry what have i forgotten  can you do it with the enterprise  i dont see why not but it must be a complete shutdown  to effect a wipe of the yamato log  including every event since we downloaded it  ill reload the ships programs from the archives in the core  geordi if we shut down it means well be bringing down the shields  were hanging nose to nose with the romulans  whether its romulan phasers or our own warp engines were just as dead  make it so  may i help  all systems functioning   lock on the captain get him back  scanning sir  got him   ive lost him  damn it  got him sir   on the romulan ship  how the hell  go to your stations  you did this   you sabotaged my ship  no  i cannot deactivate the autodestruct  but at least i have the satisfaction that you will die with us  not i think today commander  bridge picard take us out of here  the romulan vessel is set to autodestruct  wait open hailing frequencies  cmdr taris our chief engineer will transmit how to purge your system  agreed enterprise standing by  commander your transmission has been received and acknowledged  now mr data warp speed please  in case tariss engineer is not as efficient as la forge  aye sir  well number one i see why you keep the away missions to yourself  thats where the excitement is whats been happening here  same old routine i suppose
