                captain starfleet have reported a disturbance in the neutral zone  of what nature  a battle quadrant nine coordinates 070 mark three  theres no information who was involved   they ask if we can investigate  answer yes   mr la forge lay in the course  aye sir  no reports of any federation vessels in that area   ferengi  out of their territory   shall we separate the saucer  lets get more information first  course set captain   speed warp seven  aye sir warp seven  engage  we are now approaching the neutral zone  sir sensors indicate recent photon explosions and phaser activity  ive analyzed the explosions residue  this is of no known ferengi design it is possibly romulan  theres a name we havent heard for a while  i could go longer without hearing it  if they have returned to this sector we should know   mr worf any further activity  negative sir   slow to half impulse  going to onehalf impulse  now entering quadrant 907 mark three  shields and deflectors up go to yellow alert  i have located a vessel sir it is drifting   put it on main viewer  aye sir  magnify  their lifesupport systems are failing  propulsion navigation and all communication inoperative   any trace of the other vessel  no sir  if it is romulan it could be cloaked  tell starfleet were entering the neutral zone   yes sir  mr la forge take us in closer  aye sir  stay sharp everyone  its talarian   life signs  nothing yet sir  i have identified the vessel the batris a general cargo vessel  a long way from home  keep alert  captain possible life signs  what do you mean possible  the readings emanate from whats left of main engineering  radioactive clutter is making positive determination difficult  ill prepare an away team  lt yar stay at your post if this is the result of a romulan attack  they may still be in the area   aye sir  data geordi lets go  mr la forge are we close enough to use a visual acuity transmitter   we can certainly try it sir  please do  and number one  everything about this seems wrong  agreed it smells like a trap lets go  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  captains log stardate 41503 7 we have entered the neutral zone  where a talarian freighter has been severely damaged in battle  i have sent an away team to investigate  what exactly does this device do  weve been working on a way to transmit what my visor sees  if it works the bridge will be able to monitor us  it has restrictions  the information from geordis visor is difficult to encode  the signal breaks down easily   so not much range  exactly  the effective range is only a few kilometers but were working on it   la forge to bridge  this is the bridge  worf ive switched on the transmitter  we are receiving the signal is strong  ok worf im switching off for transport  set phasers on stun lets be ready for anything  energize   la forge to bridge  this is the enterprise  captain im switching on the transmitter  ready to receive on main viewer  aye sir  extraordinary  now im beginning to understand him  geordi whats that   over to the left  what  yes that no no back  yes that right there what is that  thats cmdr riker  to me its just an undefined form standing in a visual frenzy  can you filter out the extraneous information   no i get it all simultaneously  but its just a jumble  how can you make head or tail of that  i select what i want and then disregard the rest  but how is that possible  how in a noisy room  can you select one specific voice or sound   of course something you learn  exactly  its something ive learned does that make it more clear  look over at data  theres an aura around him  well of course hes an android  you say that as if you think thats what we all see  dont you  sir i hate to break this up but  yes of course number one proceed  lets go  i am detecting high levels of deuterium gas  probably from leakage in the drive system   toxic  not as yet sir  the life signs are emanating from the far side of engineering   whats the safest way around  all routes are equally dangerous  whats the least dangerous  there is no significant difference  steady on  cmdr riker   commander  yes geordi  theres a fissure in the bulkhead  the skin of the ship is losing its integrity   where is it i cant see it  right there  geordi step closer  it looks to me like a spectrograph indicating metal fatigue   is that how you interpret it  very good captain exactly right  how long before this hull ruptures  its impossible to be exact id say five minutes probably less  lets go  geordi weve lost transmission  signal overload im surprised it lasted this long  weve reached the core captain  the life signs are very strong sir they are coming from over there   is there any other way around  negative this is the only way  the safest way to proceed is for me to cross alone  the heat and toxic gases have less effect on me  agreed  captain datas gone ahead  the life signs are from the far side of engineering  ive found them sir the door to their compartment is jammed  the control mechanisms not operative sir  this is cmdr riker of the uss enterprise  do you hear me  i advise against the use of phasers the gas buildup is too great  a phaser discharge now could blow us all outta here  shall i sir   whats going on  were about to force the door  what is it what do you see  klingons  klingons   i am korris  well handle the formalities later  we have to get off this ship are there any other survivors  no  i believe ive found a quicker way out of here sir  check him out  he is alive sir but just barely  then pick up the body and lets go  no   i will carry him  as you wish  come on lets go  tasha go to transporter room three  i want you there when the away team returns  aye sir  commander we are out of time this ship is blowing  transporter room have you got a lock on us  too much interference get further away from engineering  sir engineering is critical destruction is imminent  there are no options do it  now  bridge this is cmdr riker  we are taking the survivors to sickbay   ill be in sickbay  request permission to join you  granted   the debris is still being analyzed  inform me when its completed  aye sir   situation doctor  his injuries are very critical  im jeanluc picard captain of this vessel  i am korris captain of the klingon defense force  this is lt konmel  would you mind telling me what has happened  we were passengers the talarians were taking us to outpost mz5  what was the vessel doing in the neutral zone  we were attacked without warning by a ferengi cruiser  during battle we must have entered the neutral zone  the weapons were not ferengi  what is your name  i am lt worf  and you are a member of this crew  yes  you are correct  the weapons were klingon but the vessel was ferengi   what precipitated the attack  i dont know we were in quarters  the captain of the freighter had no combat experience  so did not anticipate the first attack which was nearly fatal  we took control with his permission  the ferengi called for surrender  i told the captain to agree to all their terms  we had only one chance but i was confident that it would be enough  as adversaries the ferengi are not very worthy  still your weapons were limited and their vessel superior  yes all we had was a battery of ancient merculite rockets  our only chance was to trick them into lowering their shields  we reduced power and lured them in  they suspected nothing  when they lowered their shields to beam over a boarding party  we opened fire  there are some points that im not clear about  captain we are hungry and tired  of course  if there is anything else you wish to know we will be available  permission to show our guests to their quarters captain  permission granted  what do you think captain  theres more to this than weve been told  why was that talarian ship so far off course  what was its point of departure  why would klingon officers hitch a ride on a brokendown freighter  find out what starfleet knows about korris and company  itll take 48 hours for a message to get to starfleet  theyll be here for a while lets find out all we can about them  should i have assigned a security team to keep an eye on them  no worf can deal with anything that might arise   hows your patient doctor  not good ill keep you posted  sit friend let us eat  i did not know there were klingons serving on human starfleet vessels  as far as i know i am the only one  tell me what is it like for the hunter to lie down with the prey  have they tamed you or have you always been docile  does it make you gentle is your heart filled with peace  do glorious battles no longer inspire your dreams  why do you mock me why do you wish to anger me  only to see if it is still possible  it is  dr crusher  youd better come and look at this   his condition is worsening  hes convulsing get the hypospray  cmdr korris this is capt picard  yes captain  im sorry to report your comrades injuries  are beyond our medical abilities  hes dying  is there any special arrangement you would like for the body  it is only an empty shell now  please treat it as such  kunivass killer should have been an enemy  then his death would have been more glorious  if the opponent was not an enemy who was it  tell me what really happened  i do not wish to anger you  we are after all brothers lost among infidels  tell me how is it that you come to this ship  that uniform  through an act of kindness  the romulans attacked the khitomer outpost everyone was killed  i was buried under the rubble and left for dead  a human starfleet officer found me  he took me to his home on gault and told his wife to raise me as his son  how old were you  before the age of inclusion  that young  gault is a farming colony  when my foster brother and i were of age we entered starfleet academy  he hated it and returned to gault i stayed  you havent spent much time among your own kind  hardly none  so when the night was still and quiet  and the sound of the blood in your veins filled your ears  the only way to silence it was to slip out into the night  and like the hunter that spawned you  join in the struggle of life and death   you were unable  the others did not understand   you frightened them  they shunned you  cursed you called you vile names and you knew not why  even now do you know why you are driven  why you cannot relent or repent or confess or abstain  how could you know  there have been no other klingons to lead you to that knowledge  yes  yes those feelings are still a part of me  but i control them  they do not rule me  yes to fit in the humans demand that you change the one thing  that you cannot change but because you cannot  you do that too is the mark of a warrior  you said i mock you i do not  i salute you  against whom do you test yourself   what enemy do you battle  i have been in battle   then you understand  yes i do  brother this peace this alliance  is like a living death to warriors like us  youre right we lied to your commander  we commandeered that freighter and left the crew behind  we were in search of a place where we can live like true klingons  you did not battle the ferengi  it was one of our own cruisers sent to bring us back  you destroyed a klingon vessel  i did not want to battle our brothers i had no choice  they had been corrupted by the illusion of peace  they traded our birthright so they could die in their sleep  a peace that makes the klingon heart that beats within my chest  wither and die  is it permitted for you to show us around this ship  yes of course  and as i watched worf  it was like looking at a man that i had never known  captain longrange sensors indicate another vessel approaching   can you identify it  no sir not yet  keep a close watch on it  so close to the neutral zone it cant be random  lets look at that sensory data  what magnificent battles we could have at the helm of this ship  perhaps your dreams of glory no longer fit the time  they belong buried with the past  standing here we will never know  our answer lies out there our instincts will lead us  instincts not dulled by living among civilized men  i believe sir that was the first time  outsiders have witnessed the klingon death ritual  i can understand them looking at a dying mans eyes  but the howling  it was a warning  to who  theyre warning the dead sir  beware a klingon warrior is about to arrive  captain that unidentified vessel is approaching us at warp five  intersect one hour 16 minutes   can we get a visual  i can try sir  magnify  hello  klingons   open hailing frequencies lt yar  hailing frequencies open  klingon cruiser this is jeanluc picard of the uss enterprise  i am cmdr knera what is your purpose in this area  we came to investigate a battle we rescued three klingon survivors  that is all that is left of the crew of the cruiser tacog  theyre from the freighter batris their leader is capt korris  you have him on your ship he is alive   yes  he is a criminal  a renegade who with two others stole that freighter  and destroyed the klingon cruiser sent to bring them back  we expect the criminals to be delivered into our custody  as soon as we are within transporter range  lt yar where are they now  theyre with worf on deck 17   deck 17  yes near the battlebridge lift  shall i alert lt worf  no send a security team  worf wouldnt allow them on the battle bridge  i think we cannot assume anything  shall i remain at my tactical position or lead the team  lead the team and lieutenant  you understand with whom youre dealing  aye sir  we have heard this ship can separate in time of battle  yes when relieved of its bulk  the enterprise becomes an exceptional weapon   they have come for us  step aside  what is the problem  the captain wants those two taken into custody  do not let them take us worf   help us  listen to the voice of your blood  you are not of these people  yes join us  go back  please turn around and go back to your mother  bridge we have a hostage situation on deck 17  mommy  bridge this is lt yar  disregard situation is under control  by order of the captain you are confined to security  i thought for a minute we had a problem  yes it looked like korris was going to hold that girl hostage  that is not our way  cowards take hostages klingons do not  lieutenant  the klingon vessel has arrived  they request the return of the renegades   they will be tried and executed  i know  lieutenant i am not unmindful  of the mixed feelings you must have about this incident  thank you sir   are there no other options sir  none that i can see   he seems to be handling this well  so far  he must be torn these are his people  the klingon vessel is within range theyre requesting visual contact   open frequencies  hailing frequencies open sir  we are in position now to receive the criminals  were prepared to transfer  captain  request permission to address the captain on the klingon vessel  i know it is against procedure but there is something i must say  permission granted  what is it you want  to plead  you waste your time  their actions threaten the alliance  they disobeyed and must be punished  yes they must be punished  but not executed with dishonor  why do you care  what burns in their eyes fires my soul  i hear their words and i see it all as it was  part of me longs for that time  its bred in the bone we all do  then send them to a planet in the halee system  where they can meet death on their feet with a weapon in hand  not tied and helpless  when one of us dies that way it diminishes us all  yes  brother i feel as you  i too wish they could fly free but i have no choice  sir  we await the transfer  lt yar escort the prisoners to the transporter room  aye sir  this is ramos force field in security three has been broken  lt yar to bridge theres been an escape  at least one of my security is dead so is konmel   korris is loose and armed  keep me informed  aye sir  data visual on knera  visual on sir  captain there will be a short delay  korris has escaped  he is a trained klingon warrior captain  perhaps more than you can handle  it is not a disgrace to request our assistance  i think we can handle the situation  what  keep down  hes up there  captain korris is in main engineering  capt korris this is a futile attempt  you cannot win  i will speak only to my countryman  only to worf  captain he has a phaser aimed at the dilithium crystal chamber   at that range one blast and  i understand lieutenant  captain permission to leave the bridge  well both go  whats the situation  hes armed with a phaser we do not have a clear field of fire   how do you suggest we proceed  wait him out   captain let me talk to him  i do not think thats a good idea  hes running on adrenaline let it cool he cant go anywhere  he will wait only as long as he believes its to his advantage  the moment it is not he will fire into the dilithium crystal chamber  that would destroy the enterprise and him  yes he knows  talk to him worf  brother  i knew you would come  now i  we have a chance  i could not do it alone  but i would rather die here  than let the traitors of kling pick the meat from my bones  with you it will work  what will work  we will demand capt picard give us access to the battle bridge  we will separate from the rest of the ship  then together we will light up the galaxy  imagine the fear that will roll before us  capt picard will not comply  he cannot dare not refuse us  to save themselves they will give us what we demand  then brother we are free  put down the phaser  wait   i do not believe this  believe it  i have tasted your heart  you have been with them but you are still of us  do not deny the challenge of your destiny  get off your knees and soar  open your eyes and let the dream take flight  my brother it is you who does not see  you look for battles in the wrong place  the true test of a warrior is not without it is within  here here is where we meet the challenge  it is the weaknesses in here a warrior must overcome  no  you have talked of glory and of conquest  and legends we will write  yes the birthright of every klingon  yet in all you say where are the words duty honor loyalty  without which a warrior is nothing  what are you saying  living among these humans has sucked the klingon heart out of you  put down the phaser  you are a sham  my words were dust upon the ground  your blood has no fire you are weak like them  i dont care what you look like you are no klingon  perhaps not  wait   la forge open hailing frequencies  hailing frequencies open   knera this is capt picard  yes captain  korris and the other klingon are dead  may i speak with lt worf  yes commander  how did they die  they died well  do you wish the bodies returned  they are now only empty shells dispose of them as you see fit  when your tour of duty on the enterprise is complete  consider serving with us  your training and experience would benefit us  and perhaps there are some things we could teach you  i am honored thank you  i was just being polite sir  commendable lieutenant  mr la forge set course for starbase 84  aye sir  really i have no desire to leave the enterprise  good  coordinates set in captain   speed warp five  aye sir warp five  and mr worf  the bridge wouldnt be the same without you  engage
