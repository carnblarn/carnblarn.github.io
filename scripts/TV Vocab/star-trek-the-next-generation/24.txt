                first officers log stardate 417755  we are en route to the ocean world of pacifica  while our mission is scientific  we look forward to the blue waters and fine beaches  that make pacifica a jewel of the galaxy  so the guy staggers to his feet and goes back to the girl  she smiles looks him straight in the eye and says  just try that in hyperspace  i see so the difficulty in attaining such complex positioning  in zero gravity  and the effect it would have on a human males psychological wellbeing  is what makes this anecdote so amusing  yes very humorous indeed  hysterical in fact  what is our eta at pacifica mr la forge    increase to warp six  aye sir full impulse  would anyone object to our arriving ahead of schedule  i know i wont ive been really looking forward to a nice swim  the holodeck can be programmed to recreate an oceanic environment  data its just not the same  have you ever been for a real moonlight swim  one can swim in moonlight  how about you mr worf  swimming is too much like bathing  cmdr riker   im receiving a code 47  verify  it is code 47 sir starfleet emergency frequency  code 47 captains eyes only  captain im sorry to disturb you  yes what is it  an incoming message code 47 sir  pipe it through  this is an emergency communiqu  it is not to be discussed with fellow officers  unless deemed absolutely necessary  there will be no computer record of said transmission  understood  proceed with voiceprint identification  picard jeanluc captain uss enterprise  voiceprint verified  walker  hello its been a long time  too long old friend why are you contacting me on this frequency  it was a difficult decision i felt it was worth the risk   risk  its about starfleet  about something weve always considered impossible  i dont understand  i cant explain it now we need to talk face to face  youre using a code 47 i have to know what all this is about  not over subspace no  for gods sake this is a secured channel  no  i want you to meet me on dytallix b   when  immediately   were expected at pacifica  that can wait  you owe me and you owe it to yourself to hear what i have to say  something is beginning  dont trust anyone remember that jeanluc  dont take anything for granted   walker  dytallix b well be waiting  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  data are you familiar with dytallix b  it is an uninhabited planet  mined for the federation  by the dytallix mining company it is in the nearby mira system  mr la forge chart a course for it warp seven  there will be no records or logs mentioning this diversion  captain theyre expecting us at pacifica   shouldnt we let them know  negative  nothing goes out without specific orders from me  hopefully the delay will be minimal  i have the readout on dytallix b  what have you got  dytallix b is the fifth of six planets circling the red giant mira  one side always faces the sun temperatures reach 180 degrees  the mines line the temperate zone between the day and night sides  but they are deserted  why the devil are we going to this planet  are there any miners or indigenous life forms there  the answer to both questions is no sir  it is nothing but a lifeless hunk of rock  a useless ball of mud a worthless chunk  thank you data i get the idea  captain we are approaching dytallix b  very good number one im on my way  captain sensors are detecting three federation starships   already in orbit around the planet  identify  two are frigates the renegade commanded by tryla scott  and the thomas paine capt rixx commanding  the third is coming into range now sir  it is ambassadorclass heavy cruiser uss horatio  horatio isnt that walker keels ship  attempts at communication have been ignored by all three  make no further attempts mr worf  any lifeform readings on the surface  three sir all gathered inside what appears to be  the entrance to a mining tunnel  very well  relay those coordinates to the transporter room im beaming down   alone captain  alone number one  thanks for coming  this is some greeting old friend  tell me jeanluc where did we first meet  answer the question  tau ceti iii  it was a bar quite an exotic one as i remember what do i win  do you recall the night you introduced jack crusher to beverly  you know that i hadnt met beverly then you introduced them   my brother introduced them  you dont have one  two sisters ann and melissa what the hell is this about  apologies captain we had to be sure you were really you  walker what is going on  capt picard meet capt rixx  i believe weve met the altarian conference  and capt scott  tryla scott  you made captain faster than anyone in starfleet history  present company included are you that good  yes i am  starfleets finest fancy meeting you here  we all came secretly picard to discuss the threat  what threat  have you noticed anything unusual about starfleet command lately  no but weve been on the outer rim for a while  we havent had much contact with them  some of us have seen strange patterns emerging  unusual orders officials backing irrational proposals  starbase 12 was completely evacuated for two full days  no explanation given  and what about the deaths  mckinney ryan sipe onna karapleedeez   all dead  a series of accidents  or so they say its hard to be certain of anything  interfleet communications are at a minimum  but something is happening  we expect the enterprise to be targeted soon   targeted for what by whom  were not sure yet  jeanluc some of starfleets top command people are changing  this could affect the core of our organization  officers ive known for years bluff their way through talk of old times  thats their weakness a lack of memory  he doesnt believe us   he thinks were crazy  you give me nothing to believe in  just vague talk about strange patterns irrational proposals  whos behind this and to what purpose  how are people being changed  i cant say exactly but i think its spread to my own ship  my first officer hasnt been the same since we stopped off at earth  our medical officer says hes normal but i dont trust him  we know we dont have all the answers  all we ask is that you keep your eyes open  thats sound advice at any time  stay in touch with us covertly  this meeting never took place as far as starfleet is concerned  please im asking this as a personal favor  im glad jeanluc im glad youre still one of us  tell beverly i said hello  and watch your back picard  close friends are few and far between  two of the oldest and closest  are jack crusher may he rest in peace and walker keel  before various missions split us up we were virtually inseparable  i trust keel if he had to violate regulations  he must have had a good reason  but youre putting your career at risk for him  friendship must dare to risk counselor or its not friendship  they illicitly used the emergency channel  then they asked you to keep secrets from your superiors  effectively to disobey starfleet regulations  the people involved are of the highest caliber  i believe in their loyalty  shouldnt you tell the crew  no i dont want to risk implicating them  not until i have solid evidence that something really is wrong   take us out of orbit mr la forge  aye sir  head for pacifica warp eight  aye sir  we should arrive 963 hours behind the original schedule sir  good i have an assignment specifically suited to your talents  computer this is lt cmdr data  please access all starfleet command orders  to starships starbases and colonies for the last six months  working  doctor  the horatio was seen in orbit around dytallix   did you see walker  no  i would have loved to have seen him   it wasnt possible  captain  im picking up an unusual disturbance in a nearby quadrant  confirmed sir sector 63  specify what kind of disturbance  hard to say at this distance sir  i guess the trip to pacifica will have to wait  lets investigate  maintain speed alter course  aye sir changing course to 351 mark four  approaching sector 63 sir  slow to impulse  aye sir going to impulse power now  sensors picking up small objects sir  on screen  it doesnt look natural  agreed enlarge and identify  it looks like debris  from a space vessel of some kind  it could be a ship that was orbiting dytallix  we are close to that planet  identifying marks mr worf  nothing so far sensors not detecting any bodies in the flotsam  but from the amount of wreckage  im sorry sir it can only be the horatio  from the looks of it shes been totally destroyed  captains personal log stardate 417761  the apparent death of walker keel has had a powerful impact on me  i now believe there may be a cancer growing within the starfleet ranks  ive alerted my executive officer to the suspicions voiced by keel  theres no proof  admiral quinn tried to warn me  about a subversion within the federation  then walker tried hes dead  subversion personally i dont believe this conspiracy theory  startling  quite extraordinary in fact  direction unclear please repeat request  that was not a request i was simply  talking to myself  a human idiosyncrasy  triggered by a fascination with a set of facts  or sometimes brought about by senility  or used to weigh information before reaching a conclusion or  thank you sir i comprehend  please specify how you would like to proceed sir  please continue with record scan  intriguing  we have no facts we have to assume that the explosion was an accident  i believe what happened on the horatio was sabotage   but we cant be certain  perhaps we can  i searched for abnormal patterns in starfleets directives  i believe i have found just that  these are outposts and starbases  where ive detected unusual activity for a few months  what sort of activity  an uncustomary reshuffling of personnel usually in command areas  the new officers have frequent contact  with the highest levels of starfleet  why hasnt anyone discovered this before  the orders were given with great subtlety  starfleets left hand did not know what its right hand was doing  can you speculate as to the purpose of these reassignments  i believe it is a clandestine attempt  to control vital sectors of federation territory  this could be a prelude to an invasion  but whos behind it  theres insufficient data to make an assessment  do you suggest we warp over to hq  and demand to know whats going on   why not  yes why not  were talking about a threat to the future of the federation  i dont think any of us can rest easy until weve been to the source  captains personal log supplemental  while it is unusual for a starship to return to earth  we seem to have no other choice  i have apprised the remaining bridge crew of our situation  approaching earth   standard orbit mr la forge  standard orbit sir   any word from starfleet command  nothing so far sir  strange  captain i am now receiving a message from starfleet command  on screen  greetings enterprise i am admiral savar this is admiral aaron  and i believe you already know admiral quinn  yes good to see you again admiral  and you captain  we are always delighted when the enterprise returns to the nest  yet we are puzzled by the timing of your visit  yes sir i can imagine that you would be  governor delaplane of pacifica says you cancelled your stop there   is this true  yes sir it is  explain yourself why have you returned to earth  i would rather discuss that in person  excuse us for one moment  they seem normal enough  on the surface counselor any thoughts  hard to say someone is hiding something  but i cant tell who or what  im not overjoyed to see remmick again  their response has been pretty temperate  i dont like it you cant trust them  forgive the delay capt picard  wed be delighted if you and your first officer   would join us for dinner  delighted  it would give you an opportunity to expatiate your own viewpoint  to elaborate upon what is troubling you  thank you we accept your gracious offer  excellent preparations are already under way  well greet you in the reception area in say 20 minutes  splendid  i wont be able to attend dinner im afraid  but id like to see the ship and say hello again  of course we look forward to seeing you  enterprise out  quinn wants to see us alone  at least we know hes still on our side   mr data you have the bridge  aye sir  are you ready to beam up to the enterprise sir  yes commander quite ready  energize mr remmick   welcome aboard greg  good to see you   you remember cmdr riker  hello again   youre looking remarkably well  never felt better in my life  when you were here last you were saying you felt tired  tired of life i was but not any more  im ready for new challenges now  what about another look at this ship  remember what you told me at relva vii  about the threat that you perceived to the federation   is that why youre here  one of the reasons yes  but jeanluc you took me far too literally  i was only referring to the problems  in assimilating new races into the federation  its an ongoing tumultuous process  which can cause stress and strain on every aspect of our alliance  im sorry i must have misunderstood  dont apologize if i misled you i humbly ask your forgiveness   of course  now you have a dinner to attend  i would like to freshen up before i look around   weve arranged your usual rooms  thats outstanding  i should be getting down to the planet  riker will be available here to show you anything you want to see   its really not necessary  i insist  when youve finished showing the admiral around   you can join me down on earth  i may want to stay awhile  of course stay as long as you wish  no  its not gregory quinn it may look like him but it isnt him   are you absolutely certain  im certain  i want you to stay close keep your eye on his every move  have beverly concoct some reason for giving him a full medical exam   how  i dont know just do it   hes a senior admiral  its not him i know that now  i have to find out how this happened and who or what is behind it   if youre right  im right  should you be beaming down alone unarmed  ill take care find out what you can  then join me in force if necessary energize  good luck sir  welcome home capt picard  thank you my first officer will join us shortly  yes im sure he will  youve met cmdr remmick  under lessthanideal circumstances its nice to see you again  we have prepared a special meal in your honor  delightful why is the corridor so quiet  the last time i was here it was bustling  it usually is tonights a quiet night  yes a quiet night  ready for your tour admiral   quite ready commander  whats in the case  actually i brought it for dr crusher  perhaps you would like to see it first   what is it  a form of life  it was discovered accidentally by surveyors on an uncharted planet  we havent heard about that  you will but there is much scientific study to be done  after all it is a superior form of life   superior  totally   come have a look  ill summon my science officer  it wont like your science officer  it does like you  vitamins they do wonders for the body  riker to security guest quarters 17 emergency  lets have some andonian tea while we wait for riker  then you can tell us whats brought you here  i see you keep up with our duty roster  yes of course the enterprise is very important to us  excuse me gentlemen  to the horatio gentlemen  what an awful tragedy such a terrible loss of life  interestingly the horatio is one of the subjects i wanted to discuss  really  has the cause of her destruction been ascertained  absolutely implosion  due to the extreme negligence of her captain  enjoy picard i believe youll find it an excellent aperitif  its good youre here he slipped and hit his head  lt la forge in guest quarters 17 we have a medical emergency  dr crusher is most capable hell be alright  if youll excuse me my time here is most limited  admiral  wait till the doctor gets here  now klingon its between you and me  do klingons fear death as much as humans  i could snap your neck in a second but it wouldnt be as much fun   are you alright  if i could see id see stars  what is he  lets find out  retinal scans are an exact match it really is quinn  how can that be he picked me up like a rag doll  ill have to do a complete internal scan  keep me posted ill be on the bridge  what is that  what do you know of conspiracies   not nearly enough  thats their charm  when a machination is real no one knows about it  and when its suspected its almost never real  except in paranoid delusions for those who believe  sorry to interrupt dinner is served  wonderful this banter has given me an appetite  i need to contact my ship to let riker know were about to sit down  of course well wait for you at the table   picard to riker  dr crusher here  may i speak freely  i have little choice wheres riker  he was attacked by quinn or what we thought was quinn  specify doctor  a parasitic being has invaded quinns body  it has complete control over all brain functions  it seems to breathe through a small gill  protruding from quinns neck  look for this captain  i believe it will be visible on anyone who has been compromised  any idea what it is or where it came from  negative ive never seen anything like it  lt worf if the situation is under control   please report to the bridge  doctor  its ok he wont be waking up for a long time   continue doctor  by the placement of the tendrils  the parasite appears to stimulate the victims adrenal glands  generating great strength and resistance  ignore the details can you remove it  i dont think so  not without killing the patient  you must set your phaser on kill stun has little effect  doctor one does not beam down to starfleet headquarters armed  your food is getting cold  im going in to dinner now doctor  tell cmdr riker to join me as soon as hes ready  picard out  please sit down weve been waiting  go ahead and start we dont stand on ceremony here  do eat up picard  raise your hand if you want seconds  riker thank god  were leaving  youre not going anywhere  youll be one of us soon  you were meant for the doctor  it couldnt be helped riker walked in on us unexpectedly  no matter the doctor will be joining us soon  all in good time  well capt scott good  now the setting is complete  you dont think we were in the dark about your intentions  patience is one of our virtues captain  we didnt go after you we allowed you to come after us  more dramatic that way dont you think  yes the one thing both races share is a love of theatre  and youve put on a fine show  what race are you where are you from  its not important let us just say weve come a long way to join you  its a perfect match were the brains youre the brawn  youll understand soon  indeed weve been moving cautiously for many months now  careful to cover our tracks careful not to arouse suspicion  until its too late  now its too late for you that is  well said brother  picard and riker control the enterprise  which means we control the enterprise  eat hearty brother  relish your new body  aaron  can i help you gentlemen  is there any trouble here  perhaps if you tell me what it is  remmick  no will  you dont understand  we mean you no harm  we seek peaceful coexistence  captains log stardate 417802  how difficult after years of learning to respect life  to be forced to destroy it  but there seems to be no alternative  quinn is expected to recover fully  there is no trace of the parasite which took control of him  well never know how many of these life forms infiltrated starfleet  but it seems they could not survive without the mother creature  which had taken over cmdr remmick  it was dr crushers idea to simulate the gill  it had to fool everyone including you  that it did rest assured  captain i have attempted to trace the message remmick was sending  i believe it was aimed at an unexplored sector of our galaxy  any idea what the message was   i believe it was a beacon  a beacon  yes sir a homing beacon sent from earth
