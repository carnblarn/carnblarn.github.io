                cmdr riker report to bridge  on the way  harry come back here  whats your hurry  sorry commander i was just   sorry if he bothered you  no bother dr bernard  im not going back i hate that teacher and i hate calculus  everyone needs an understanding of basic calculus like it or not  why  youre limping  a runin with an aspiring sprinter   number one  problem  more a curiosity  weve been tracking faint energy readings to locate its source  its like following a trail of breadcrumbs  the pathfinder led us here and then stopped  which i knew would interest you   whats our position geordi  the epsilon mynos system sir  captain youre right i wouldnt miss this  whats so interesting about this system  aldea  im surprised you havent heard of aldea the wondrous mythical world  like atlantis of ancient earth or neinman of xerxes vii  advanced culture centuries old selfcontained peaceful  incredible technical sophistication providing for all citizens  who turned themselves over to art and culture   where is it  thats the myth  legends say the aldeans were able to cloak their planet in darkness  and go unseen by marauders and other hostile passersby  who might rob and plunder   what a wonderful fairy tale  scanners still show nothing  scanners may show nothing but im sensing something very strong  thousands of minds   from where  very close  all stop and hold this position  aye sir all stop and hold  anything  im recording a distortion in quadrant one mark 90  on screen   shields and deflectors up  aye sir  its aldea captain it has to be  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  captains log stardate 415091  either by chance or intent weve been led to the planet aldea  which appeared out of nowhere hidden behind a shielding device  sensors indicate that the shield is electromagnetic  a complicated lightrefracting mechanism   a cloaking device  aye sir  it must be pretty sophisticated to hide a planet  were being scanned sir  well let them know our peaceful intention open hailing frequencies  frequencies open sir  i am rashella welcome to aldea  i  i am jeanluc picard captain of the uss enterprise   we come in peace  we know  weve heard stories about aldea but i never believed they could be true  our shield has confused outsiders for millennia captain  thats a very long time to have such technology  why do you reveal yourselves now  we are eager to meet to discuss that  and other subjects of mutual interest   were ready any time  excellent  we mean no harm  our arrival seems to have startled you  it was a little sudden  im radue first appointee to aldea  welcome aboard  they havent been through decontamination  our doctor is concerned you didnt go through our transporting procedure  you couldnt transport us the only way through our shield is our way  our cloaking device may be off but our shield is operating  weve brought you small tokens of welcome  and a personal invitation to a celebration on aldea  that would be delightful number one assemble the away team  we will prepare for your arrival cmdr riker   how do you know  your name  weve been monitoring your ships communications  we must now return to aldea  our eyes are very sensitive to bright light rashella  amazing  to exist only in that dream world of myth  and then suddenly to be here  they placed the breadcrumbs were not here by accident  do you sense anything  they want something from us something we value greatly  so much that theyre afraid we wont part with it  we are ready to receive you cmdr riker  and two of your colleagues  interesting choices  i hope that duana and i know how to greet you properly commander   how does the cloak work  the theory is simple  the shield bends light around the planets contour  like the romulan cloaking device  but the implementation is quite difficult   captain  data what do you read  some sort of scanning device sir  dont touch him   its from aldea  shields up contact riker   worf check decks  shields inoperable  all decks being probed   all decks the entire ship  aye sir  i cant reach the commander were blocked  wesley are you alright  it was scary at first but i didnt really feel anything  sir similar incidents all decks but only with the children  yes we are an ancient power but weve suffered for it  our history is littered with the deaths of aldeans  who wanted more things nothing was ever enough  so weve evolved a simple way of living  for whatever is taken something is given in return   that seems an equitable code  its brought us peace  unfortunately there are few of us left to enjoy it  why  that is part of what we wish to discuss  we need help from the federation to rebuild our heritage  we need a younger generation strong and healthy  following in the aldean traditions  how can the federation help influence your children in your traditions  because we have no children commander  rashella was the last child born on this planet  and your medical community can do nothing  theyve tried dr crusher and failed  perhaps we can help  exactly why were we invited here  we propose a trade which would solve our problem  and give something to the federation  the nature of this trade  we need some of your children  well give you information  that would take you centuries to acquire  that might be acceptable to some other races  but humans are unusually attached to their offspring  our children are not for sale at any price  we sympathize with your situation but what you ask is not possible   and thats your final answer  thats my only answer  if theres another way we can help  im sorry you are so intransigent  still no response sir  wesley  theyve taken my son  alexandra  saucer section reports six more children have gone  its the children  thats why were here thats what they wanted  and thats what they have  status  aldean shield still up no response  keep trying counselor gather the parents  theyll need to speak to you as well  captain your children are with us  my word of honor no harm will ever come to them  harm has already come to them  let us begin discussions regarding appropriate compensation  compensation  you have stolen our children from their classrooms and bedrooms  and you talk about compensation  you claim to be civilized yet you have committed an act of barbarity  captain we will continue these discussions when youve calmed down  wesley im frightened  i know you are katie we all are but were gonna be alright  everyone knows where we are  no one is going to hurt you i promise  greetings wesley crusher  the custodian indicated that you would be the leader  the custodian who is the custodian  the custodian is not a person  you are here as our guests well provide anything you need or want  we want to go home  wesley all of you have been chosen because you are special  just ask for anything you want and you shall have it  whats happened to alexandra and the other children   how are you getting them back  toya sit down  dont give in to fear  we all knew the risks when we signed on  thats the choice we made  capt picard will do anything to bring them back  the aldeans want to discuss compensation   compensation  that will buy us time  dr crusher will be involved in these negotiations  as your representative  why were these specific children taken  we cant be sure  we do know the aldeans cant have children of their own  then they wont let them go easily  i wont insult you by pretending that this will be easy  but i can tell you that we will not leave them behind  you can be assured of that  can we talk with our children give them some reassurance  let them know that they will be safe  ill do my best to arrange that  the last time i saw him i yelled at him  there you are i have you now  dont be alarmed the other children have been assigned to their units  units  a unit is a group where those of similar talents live together   do you mean like a family  you could call it that  we already have families  does capt picard know about this  we keep nothing from him  weve been waiting for you so long harry  we are artists just like you  we see within you your potential  im not an artist  you will be and a great one  this way  unit b 375   i am honored  thank you  melian is the foremost musician on aldea  music speaks its own language  well have much to learn from each other  dont worry youll be seeing wesley soon  what about me dont i get a say in this  wesley sometimes something happens which you just must accept  you are all now members of this society  that will not change  so make the transition as easy as possible for the others  its your duty because you are their leader  help them to accept it  nothing you or those on the starship can do can change it  because like you  we also have no choice  where have you been rashella zena and aran are waiting for alexandra   no  no i told you that she  no radue they cant have her i will never let her go   any response from aldea  not yet  captain data has found something interesting  the aldean shield gives evidence of random fluctuations  weakening its structure in sections   there are holes in their defense  in essence yes  i find it surprising that the aldeans have not perfected their technology  id assume theyd have repaired it  could we beam a team through those holes  possibly it would have to be perfectly timed  we may be able to decipher the code to transport through the shield   can you do that  im working on it now  but the permutations are almost endless  keep trying  number one you and la forge try and find some way  of getting through one of those holes  somehow an away team must locate the power source for the shield  and neutralize it   youre certain theyll negotiate  theyll negotiate  or theyll call it that theyve taken what they want  now theyll rationalize it by throwing us some bone  and when we dont accept their offer  once they believe we wont accept their compensation  theyll break off the discussion disappear behind their shield  locking us out and the children in for ever  thats why ive got to keep them talking  custodian wesley crushers voice  will be entered into the authorized file for thirdlevel clearance  proceed duana  announce yourself to the custodian  hello custodian i am wesley crusher  hello wesley  your voice will now activate thirdlevel clearance  what does that mean  you may ask any questions you wish  thank you  duana what does the custodian do  it frees us from burden takes care of our needs  it regulates our lives   who built it  the progenitors   when  hundreds of centuries ago  what is its power source  wesley why is that important it does what we ask it always has  what difference does it make how it works  if you dont know how can you repair it  why would we want to repair it  from time to time every computer i mean custodian needs maintenance  wesley radue was right  you ask questions i cant answer  ask the custodian instead  custodian can you show me where harry is  yes  custodian show me harry  i never did this before its fun  youre making him into a sculptor  he already is he was just never encouraged properly  that tool will allow him to bring out his visions   itll take years to learn that  no it will happen quite quickly  custodian show me alexandra  custodian show me mason  stop custodian we must work now theres much to learn  whats in there  the power source  i dont know  captains log supplemental we remain in orbit around aldea  its becoming evident  that talk will not effect the return of our children  we must neutralize the aldean shield  until then we are helpless  sir radue is hailing us   capt picard  dr crusher and i are ready radue  are you ill captain  no dr crusher is a staff officer  starfleet regulation 657 requires that two staff officers  are present during any negotiations  very well  not much on pleasantries is he  captain i am not aware of regulation 657  no neither am i  i see sir  dr crusher report to the bridge well see what they have in mind  before we begin we want to see the children  no were here to negotiate compensation not pander to emotions  please sit  we do not condone your actions  youre offering us goods in exchange for our children  why do you want them back you can have more  youre trifling with our primal instincts  i must warn you that humans are willing to die for their children  returning the children is nonnegotiable  i promise you they will have a beautiful life with us  and theyll be parents to a new breed born of an ancient culture  but how can you be sure that they can have children you cant  but they will our inability to bear children is a genetic dysfunction  its not contagious  we sympathize with your situation  surely there is a solution that can be mutually satisfactory  for us the problem is solved  were offering you information on areas of the galaxy  you do not even know exist  what more can we offer what more would you like  a significant beginning  but first i ask that dr crusher be allowed to see her son  you are a stubborn people  well that too can be a positive trait  you may see him  mom  wes   i knew you all would get us home  not yet wes  are you ok and the others  ok really ok  weve been assigned to our units like families  theyre treating us like gods  dont let it go to your head  i wont  wes seems fine he says the others are too   of course theyre well  you have our offer it is final  captain  we want you to understand the nature of your choice  a small demonstration of our power   what was that  a repulser beam   position report  this is unbelievable sir  according to my calculations were three days from aldea   at warp nine  thats a small demonstration   geordi get us back to aldea  aye sir  captain if you dont accept our terms  the enterprise will be pushed so far away  that by the time you return your children will be grandparents  captains log stardate 415124  we are 20 hours from aldea and no closer to a solution  their show of force pushed us out of orbit and could have destroyed us  hold it a little bit more firmly  thats it perfect  now think no think is not right  feel the notes inside your head  im sorry did i break it  no its alright you cant break this  it did exactly what i thought i mean felt  yes its a direct reflection of the music within  now we just have to teach you to structure that feeling try it again  that was beautiful  now play something happier  thats not the way i feel  i dont want to do this any more  see harry i told you you would be an artist  are you sure did i really do this  oh yes your talent has always been there  the sculpting tool is just helping you develop it  its what you were meant to do  i dont have to take calculus any more  you dont have to do anything you dont want to do   whats calculus  nothing important  can i do some more  captains log supplemental  it is three days since the aldeans pushed us away  we have had no contact with radue since then   open hailing frequencies lt yar  frequencies open sir  radue this is picard  welcome back captain what have you decided  that there is room for discussion radue  we will bring you down when were ready   data defeat that shield  that may be impossible  things are only impossible until theyre not  captain  heres what ive learned so far duana is dying  i dont think the other aldeans are any healthier  they have chromosomal damage  it could be genetic or environmental   thats why they cant conceive  it explains their lack of appetite  extreme pallor and sensitivity to light  an entire civilization thats terminally ill is it reversible  i wont know until i find the cause and i know time is running out  good work doctor   have the lesions gone  yes the medicine worked again  good come see what harrys doing  beautiful  yeah it really turned out well  its so alive and graceful what dyou call it  its a dolphin  it swims in the ocean like a fish only its not a fish  a fish  we used to have those in our oceans ive never seen one before  i used to live near the ocean on zadar iv  my dads an oceanographer he says that  never mind it doesnt matter  i want mommy  you havent eaten  you didnt eat anything   we need very little  we know you miss your family  but youll grow accustomed to us i promise youll be happy  we were happy before we came  we are offering more especially for you  duana i feel badly for you that you have no children  but i have to tell you that we dont want to be here  and we will not cooperate  custodians room  custodian this is wesley crusher  proceed wesley  show me where the enterprise children are in relation to here   thank you goodnight  goodnight wesley  i think i know a way to get us home i need your help  chief medical officers log stardate 415129  i suspect that whatever is killing the aldeans  is related to a danger faced by earth in the 21st century  can it be that aldeas ozone layer has been weakened  why will not talking or eating make them send us home  its called passive resistance  we dont do what they want us to do and they wont want us   will they get mad at us  they wont hurt us  but wes i do kinda like them  so do i but i dont want to stay here for ever do you  no but i like working with the wood  harry we all have to be in this together or its not gonna work  ok   ill do it  what are you all doing here  what is going on here  ive got it the aldeans are suffering from radiation poisoning   is that why theyre sterile  yes   is it reversible  with treatment  captain these permutations are going to take a very long time   how long  weeks   there is another way  we defined weakness in the shield  its not a hole its a fluctuation  it may be possible to beam onto the planet   why dont we beam the children up  the risk would be greater  you and data beam down find the power source knock it out  ill delay the aldeans till youre ready  will you at least eat   no alexandra  why  we cant eat i know youre hungry we all are  but its our way of saying we want to go home understand  yeah  were ready lt worf  captain you may come down now to conclude our discussions  or your ship may leave its your choice  dr crusher and i are prepared to conclude our negotiations  transporter room now  this is it commander  it is programmed to accept only authorized voice command   we cant override  no  but i can scramble the input so that nobody else can  before we begin captain you must speak with the children  it seems they are on some sort of strike i dont understand it  you must deal with this captain im not very good with children  strike ill see what i can do  im sure if we just stick together guys well all be  hi capt picard   sir i knew youd come  its not over yet wesley  i think i figured out the computer but im not sure   its a different system from ours  good wesley now   captain  yes harry  if something happens and we have to stay  will you tell my dad im sorry i made him angry and that i miss him  you will tell him that  and i will tell him how much i admire his son   hello alexandra  hi  what is this   they want to go home  no theyre staying   number one  were in position  hold for orders  the radiation levels on aldea have been building up over a long time  it happened on earth in the 21st century  the ozone layer deteriorated  and the planet was flooded with ultraviolet radiation  the shield that protected your world is also weakening it  the radiation of your own sun is destroying you  youre trying to confuse the issue  please listen youre all suffering from radiation poisoning  sterility is only the latest symptom  the children will be affected as well  impossible our scientists would have known  how theyve forgotten how everything works   no all lies  no wait  dont send them back yet what if theyre right  instead of the children being our hope  what if were condemning them to our fate  theyre just protecting their interests  as are we but hear them out  they are saying that the very thing which has given us this world  is what has caused this tragedy  exactly your custodian has controlled you so completely  you wont even question it  lies and the discussion is over  cmdr riker i assume you have control of the computer  we disabled it temporarily  we neutralized the power source  good enterprise this is picard beam the children up   wait  enterprise hold  thank you  let me get the dolphin for you  no you keep it ill make another one   alright harry  yes captain  ok kids lets go home  beam them up  you have destroyed us  were not here to destroy you radue we can help you  what is it  a legacy of your progenitors  the source of your power and of your problems  its reading incredible amounts of energy  more since weve taken down the shield   what are we going to do with it  learn all over again  all this time weve been destroying ourselves  so sure of our technological invulnerability  now we must learn to use this power safely   will you let us help  yes please  i want to be an artist i dont want to take calculus  you can be anything you want harry anything  but you still have to take calculus  ok thanks dad  it worked well sir  we have successfully reseeded the ozone layer  but for it to be sustained they can never use the shield  or be cloaked again  are you finished  yes and theyre responding very well to the treatment  the legend will die but the people will live  we know theyll make good parents   wesley  sorry captain  she wanted to thank you for bringing her home to her mother  thank you  come on alexandra  mr la forge out of orbit warp five  yes sir certainly sir
