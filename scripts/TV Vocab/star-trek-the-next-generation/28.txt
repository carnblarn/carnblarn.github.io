                captains log stardate 422863  we have arrived on station at coordinates 3629 by 584  three days early for our rendezvous with the uss victory  there is nothing to do now but hold this position and wait  yes commander  is there a problem chief engineer la forge called urgent  of course hes over there with the victory  geordi i just had a strange conversation with your assistant  although it is three days until we rendezvous with the victory  she believes it has already arrived  not the starship my friend the original  this is my gift to the victorys captain zimbata  most unusual  i served with him sure wish hed been in command of this victory  wind and sail thats the proper way to move a ship  but your speciality is antimatter power dilithium regulators  thats exactly why this fascinates me data  its human nature to love what we dont have  simpler days huh  anyway stringing this rigging has made me dream of handling sails  this is not a computer simulation  the point in doing something like this is to make it by hand  geordi your message said urgent  so it is  while were waiting we have time for me to be watson  more properly your watson  my watson  ive shown you one of my dreams lets go and share in one of yours  that does seem only fair   let no one touch this  aye sir where can i reach you  he can be reached at 221b baker street  sir  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilisations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  computer select at random a mystery by sir arthur conan doyle  in which i will play sherlock holmes and lt la forge dr john watson  program complete you may enter  excellent  look at all the detail  so you say everything in here has some significance  holmes collected nothing no trinkets no thoughts  which were not specifically significant to him  this  the emerald tiepin presented to holmes by queen victoria  after he solved the theft of the brucepartington plans  whitakers almanack which gave holmes the key to the secret code  in the valley of fear  the snuffbox of wilhelm gottslieg siegesmann van der romstein  alright data you solve the cases and get all the gifts what do i do  primarily as dr watson you will keep a record of all i say and do  for later publication  and the famous holmes violin  bought in a pawn shop in tottenham court road for 55 shillings  which he considered to be a very good investment  in the hands of some the violin is a wondrous thing  equally capable of stirring the soul to the heights of bliss  as to the depths of despair  but  data thats incredible how can you play it like that  merely throwing myself into the part watson  but in the hands of my friend mr sherlock holmes  the violin ceases to be a musical instrument at all and becomes  watson we are about to have guests  how could you  please answer that mustnt keep the inspector waiting   inspector who  lestrade of course  holmes are you there man  thank the almighty youre available im in a deuce of a dilemma  may i say your perturbation becomes you lestrade  and also affords me the opportunity to yet again serve queen and country   holmes really talked like that  absolutely  we need your help holmes  this gentleman here the emissary of a foreign government  has been the victim of a most accidentally wicked crime  damn havent they invented the electric light by now  what dear fellow  pray continue inspector  to put the matter simply this man was accosted by gypsies  intent on depriving him of his most valuable possessions  in the process of picking his pockets  they also bagged a photograph this man was carrying  great scott the photograph  you will find that this emissary  works not for but against the king of bohemia  that photograph of the king and his mistress  is to be used for blackmail  further upon deeper reflection you will deduce as did l  computer freeze program  exit  geordi where are you going geordi  im done  but  i was about to reveal that the sir is in fact  what was the point in going to the holodeck   to solve a holmes mystery  exactly  but youve memorised them  once anyone speaks youve got it solved so theres no mystery  if theres no mystery theres no game no game no fun  im not upset with you  its just we arrange the time to go to the holodeck get the wardrobe  then boom before we get started you jump to the end  i was looking forward to the mystery  i should have extended the sequence of events  oh im not getting through  the fun in the program data was in the attempt to solve a mystery  is that not what we were doing  youre wasting your breath lieutenant  saying that to data is asking a computer not to compute  am i so different from you doctor can you cease thinking on command  in medicine i often face puzzles i do not know the answer to  shes right you always know the answer  to feel the thrill of victory there must be possible failure  wheres the victory if you cant possibly lose  are you suggesting there is value in losing  yes thats the great teacher  we humans learn more often from a failure or a mistake  than we do from an easy success  not you you learn by rote all is memorisation and recitation  deductive reasoning is also one of datas strengths  yes and holmess too  but holmes understood the human soul  the dark flecks that drive us that turn the innocent into the evil  that understanding is beyond data  now youre just being unfair doctor  i dont think so lieutenant  your artificial friend hasnt a prayer of solving a holmes mystery  he hasnt read   i have read them all  see  maybe the computer could create one where you wouldnt know the outcome   as i said he hasnt a prayer  i accept your challenge doctor  good for you  we shall return to the holodeck i shall dare it to defeat me  and you madam are invited to be a witness  i wouldnt miss it  come watson  there ive instructed the computer to give us a holmestype problem  but not one written specifically by conan doyle  so this will be something new  exactly will that be sufficient doctor  well see  program complete you may enter  pies pies some are meat and some are sweet  very impressive   your first visit to a holodeck  with this level of sophistication  how does it work london was hundreds of square kilometres large  this is no larger than the holodeck  so the computer places images of more distant perspective on the walls  but youd have to touch the wall to know it was there  and it fools you in other ways  i say holmes where shall we head the theatre a concert perhaps  stop him  stop him he stole my goods  no it is a ruse  this way   whats here data  what are you doing tell us  the youth was a ploy the real crime is here  the intended victim is that man mr jabez wilson  employee of the redheaded league and dupe of some criminals  i saw this plaque home of the redheaded league  and this rope on the bell  it enabled me to deduce that mr wilson was headed here  to meet a most distasteful and untimely demise  from this  fraud you didnt deduce anything  you just recognised elements from two different holmes stories  reasoning from the general to the specific  is that not the very definition of deduction the way holmes worked  variations on a theme now do you see my point  all that he knows is in his memory banks  inspiration original thought all the true strength of holmes  is not possible for our friend  ill give you credit for your vast knowledge  but your circuits would short out  if you were confronted with a truly original mystery   its elementary dear data  wait a minute  well see whose circuits short out   computer arch  are you sure you want to do this  better wilted laurels than none at all  computer override previous program  ok a program that definitely challenges data  with events he has no previous knowledge of  computer in the holmesian style create a mystery to confound data  with an opponent who has the ability to defeat him   define parameters of program  what does that mean   how far to take the game  you mean limiting your risk  no the parameters will be whatever is necessary to meet the directive  create an adversary capable of defeating data   what was that  lieutenant  an odd surge of power sir its gone now  interesting  the same london but slightly different  is something wrong professor  i i feel like a new man  that dark fellow there used the word arch and then  i wonder  arch   what have we here  computer standing by  what are you  if you refer to the arch you ordered it provides computer control  do you wish to input any commands  not at this time  its dark magic moriarty  the best kind im sure  but i need information  data i mean holmes old boy what are we looking for  for whatever finds us watson   she has been abducted  who has  the good doctor  i think shes hiding  shes gonna lead you on a wildgoose chase and then tell everyone  the doctor has been carried away by two men one is tall  the other is shorter lefthanded and is employed in a laboratory  how do you know that  one set of footfalls is widely spaced  the other is evenly spaced closer together  further on the ground you can see the scrapes made by his left shoe  as he twists behind presumably to see if he is being followed  leftfooted means lefthanded  the dark colourings of the scrapes are the leavings of natural rubber  a type of nonconductive sole  used by researchers experimenting with electricity  finally there can be no argument the game is afoot  come watson  hear that what do those footfalls tell you watson  were on the right track  more particularly that our opposition does consist of two men  and that one of them is carrying the bound and gagged dr pulaski  you know this because you read it in a holmes story right  not at all  we do not hear her steps so the doctor is probably being carried  we do not hear cries for help so she must be gagged  further both sets of footfalls are heavy and masculine  one man shuffles and stumbles in an irregular pattern  since the ground is level we must conclude  that dr pulaski is struggling with her captor  sporadically knocking him off stride  deduction pure and simple  well not that simple  footfalls  there they are again watson  i dare say we have caught up nicely with our quarry  there should be a doorway  yeah come on  holmes thank god youre here  make way please make way for sherlock holmes  its murder holmes murder most foul  well holmes what do you say man  i do not see how this connects with the doctors disappearance  doctor dr watson is right here  dr pulaski but do not be concerned you have enough on your mind   she was with you  if i may be of assistance  as i take note of this dead man i deduce that he was strangled  the finger marks on his throat show this  there are signs of struggle  so the murderer was a stranger who attacked him from behind   is that correct holmes  no  look at his shoes hes a convict released today from dartmoor prison  he spent the day in a tavern consuming large amounts of gin  with his killer who followed him to this very spot  and waited over there until the victim slipped into a drunken stupor  then out of fear motivated only by selfprotection strangled him   there is your killer inspector  seize her  when you check i believe you will find that this poor soul  is the victims commonlaw wife  who has been dreading the release of this vile man  she hardly has the strength to strangle a man this size  not with her hands no but with this   when used as a garrotte these beads make a mark similar to fingerprints  and watson you will note on the victims throat  the marks are too evenly spaced to have been made by human hands  astounding holmes  not really inspector  and now for strictly personal reasons i must leave come watson  this murder does not connect with our case  come along hurry it up come on  data wait  if this murder is unconnected to dr pulaski  then the computer is running an independent program   yes  why  i do not know that is what puzzles me   so you dont know whatll happen  no   excellent where to now  we will find dr pulaski in here   hows that  it is obvious  why is that correct isnt this a game of misdirection   not now he wants us to find him  who does  the master criminal the man holmes could only defeat  at the cost of his own life at reichenbach falls  our adversary my dear watson  is none other than professor moriarty himself  now this is getting interesting  theres nothing here but barrels  and a trail  which is so well marked that obviously we are meant to follow it  no data its another dead end  no watson its not a dead end at all  hello whats this  can you see the scratches  the doctor was right finally we have a game worth playing  the time for games is over  professor moriarty i presume  how do you know  hes the one worthy opponent created by conan doyle  and like a spider i feel vibrations when anyone new chances into my web  welcome my dear holmes but not holmes  and dr watson but not watson  how does he know were not who we appear to be   where is dr pulaski  shes here  she will have said nothing  she has provided many answers do you forget i am your equal  i have read her expressions  what she has not said is as important as her words   have you injured her  i will if necessary  but my mind is crowded with images  thoughts i do not understand yet cannot purge  they plague me  you and your associate look and act so oddly  yet though i have not seen the like of you  i am familiar with you both very confusing  i have felt new realities at the edge of my consciousness  readying to break through  surely holmes if thats who you are  you of all people appreciate what i mean  say nothing  i know that there is a great power called computer  wiser than the oracle at delphi  a power which controls all of this and to which we can speak  arch  data this isnt right a hologram shouldnt be able to call the arch  it has described a monstrous shape  on which i am like a fly stuck on a turtles back adrift in emptiness  what is this holmes  data wait  why does it frighten you holmes  data will you please tell me whats going on  computer exit  computer execute complete shutdown of the holodeck   access denied  explain  override protocol has been initiated  the program didnt shut down  we must see the captain  wait whats on that paper why cant we shut down the holodeck  this  this is impossible  how can a character from   whos got control of the computer  he does moriarty   impossible i dont understand  nor do l  what about the doctor is she alright in there  no she is in grave danger  computer why wasnt the holodeck program terminated  the override protocol has been initiated   on whose authority  lt geordi la forge  me  alright tell me from the beginning exactly what happened  dr pulaski and i had a discussion  about whether data could solve an original mystery  which the computer provided   yes with a worthy opponent  worthy of holmes  my god  i asked for a holmestype mystery  with an opponent capable of defeating data   thats got to be it  merde  captain im sorry  i understand lieutenant  captain this character moriarty he called for the arch  he did what so he has access to the computer  and perhaps our library files as well  that information would be necessary to create a true adversary for me  theorise data what are his limits  he is still a fictional character  originally programmed with 19thcentury knowledge  which now has access to   what does he need to use it  only time  sir i can lead a security team to sweep the holodeck  and bring the doctor out  i believe that would place the doctor at risk  our mortality failsafe has probably been overridden   computer where is dr pulaski  dr pulaski is on holodeck two   and her vital signs  strong and stable  captain recommend we attempt to destroy  the hologram generations themselves is that possible geordi  i could split a particle beam out of the matterantimatter chamber  and ride it into the holodeck  if accelerated sufficiently  that would wash away all present holographic constructs  the london buildings streets people all gone including moriarty  dr pulaski  the beam will tear apart human flesh as well  captain im sensing something from the holodeck  its as if a unifying force or single consciousness  is trying to bring it all into focus  there can be only one explanation  in programming moriarty to defeat me not holmes  he had to acquire something which i possess  what exactly  consciousness sir without it he could not defeat me  computer what happened  altitude and stabilisation control of the enterprise  was momentarily transferred to holodeck two  data you and i should return to the holodeck   i will change into my uniform  no i will change into a costume  uniforms might pose questions i dont want asked  it seems that he feeds on knowledge  well lets not give your nemesis any more information than we have to   how did you make the room shake  im not sure  now dear lady will that be one lump or two  lumps professor what sort of lumps   milk of course  why not  mr computer proposes the incredible thought  that we are all travelling in a vessel of some sort  is that true  i dont know what youre talking about  the scones are likewise a must  this is really quite excellent  strange it actually pleases me to hear you say that  very strange  youre sounding very different from the moriarty ive read about   youre not frightened of me  no  you should be  mr computer the arch please  a few more questions mr computer  i just cant seem to remember that last command  oh well sooner or later itll all come to me  but in the meantime  i will approach the problem from a familiar perspective  theres no reason why i cant use knowledge from my world   to bring me closer to yours  i have no idea what you mean  of course you do  the more you proclaim ignorance the more i am on to you  your every silence speaks volumes  if you know what im saying when im not saying anything  what do you need me for  thank you for the tea and crumpets i guess ill be going  where back to here  yes would you care to join me  in time  in time i will leave all of this and join you out there  or is this where we both are right now  right now we are in london  tell me what you want from me or allow me to leave  i want nothing more than what the fisherman expects of the worm  you dear doctor will be the lure  and this will be the hook for your capt jeanluc picard  who is that  how well you know   nice suit  thank you  captain i will be standing by to assist you  youll be a big hit in london  computer is the program still running  affirmative you may enter  data shall we go  gentlemen  open  we dont have much time hes getting more control  lets try to beat moriarty by giving him everything he wants  obviously hes trying to alter the programming   captain  tuppence  two pence supposed to be good luck we may need some  ill take that coin sir thats right and any more you got   excuse me  i dont think so i want money   thats right i want it now  data  this hologram differs from any ive seen could he injure you  its more serious than that  the mortality failsafe has been circumvented he couldve killed me  let it go guv hes hurtin me  data let him go  we will find moriarty this way sir the warehouse  you alright  yes except for being crammed full of crumpets  im a civilised abductor captain civilised but still dangerous   bridge to holodeck control worf  here sir   status anything changed  no sir  moriarty you were conjured up in an attempt to defeat holmes here  once that attempt is concluded your program has run its course  your existence is done  congratulations professor i capitulate to the better man  your victory sir is  is well earned  its gone beyond that game mr data  note i no longer call you holmes  whatever i was when this began i have grown  i am understanding more and more  i am able to use the power at my fingertips  i can affect this vessel  and i can inflict bodily harm on you and on your doctor  yes you can do that but you havent  you shook this ship to get my attention what is it you want  the same thing you want for yourself to continue to exist  if i destroy this vessel can you say that it doesnt matter to you  interesting pun dont you think for matter is what i am not  the computer says i am made up only of energy  that may not be entirely true professor  this which we call the holodeck  uses a principle similar to a device called a transporter  in the time we live humans have discovered  that energy and matter are interchangeable  in the holodeck energy is converted into matter thus you have substance  but only here  and if i step off this holodeck  then professor you will cease to exist  you are not alive as i said before you are only  a holographic image i know   but are you sure  yes  does he have life hes a machine but is that all he is  no he is more  exactly  is the definition of life cogito ergo sum i think therefore i am  yes that is one possible definition  it is the most important one  and for me the only one that matters  you asked your computer to program a nefarious fictional character  from 19thcentury london which is how i arrived  but i am no longer that creation that evil character  i have changed i am alive and i am aware of my own consciousness  moriarty my responsibility is this vessel and its crew  i want my existence i want it out there just as you have yours  that may not be possible   then you must murder me captain  i cannot give you what you want  because you cannot convert holodeck matter into a more permanent form  yes that is so  a pity  what i have seen  what i have learned  fascinates me  i do not want to die  and i do not want to kill you  madam i have enjoyed your company  computer arch  cancel override protocol  return control of the holodeck to main computer  my fate is in your hands  as perhaps it always was   bridge this is the captain  cmdr riker here sir  number one the situation is under control  aye sir  moriarty this vessels computer has a vast memory capacity   i know  you wont be extinguished  we will save this program hopefully in time when we know enough  we will bring you back able to leave the holodeck  perhaps well meet again madam  it could be a while time wont pass for you but i may be an old woman  but ill still fill you with crumpet madam  i detest long goodbyes  you have the arch  as you wish a short goodbye  computer save the program of the character moriarty then discontinue  damaged  yes sir she cracked a spar when the enterprise was shaken  otherwise she weathered it quite nicely  shes beautiful a wonderful testimony to simpler times  yes sir thank you sir  its just that i cant help thinking how  what else might have happened because i misspoke a single word  soon shell be shipshape and bristol fashion  bristol fashion sir  its an old navy phrase meaning everything in perfect order  yes sir  as are we mr la forge  yes sir  captain starship victory has arrived  on my way number one
