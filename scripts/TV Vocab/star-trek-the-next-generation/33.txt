                we are approaching star base 179 sir   half impulse mr crusher  going to half impulse  captain this is the bridge we have arrived at star base 179  acknowledged number one  establish position 090 mark 345 at 27000 kilometers  hailing frequencies  open  star base 179 this is the enterprise  enterprise this is star base 179 ready for transfer on your mark  cmdr data you have the bridge ensign crusher youre with me  star base 179 we are ready to commence transfer  acknowledged enterprise begin transfer  welcome aboard the enterprise im cmdr riker your first officer  those here as replacements step outside and follow lt lewis  he will assign you to your crew quarters  ensign youre on the exchange programme follow mr crusher  mordoc how are you here you cant have graduated already  i am not mordoc i am mendon  ensign mendon from the planet benzar  sorry its a friend of mine you look just like him  we are from the same geostructure naturally we look alike  how do you tell each other apart  we just do  its nice to have you here ensign  briefing and indoctrination begin in 15 minutes  i want to say how happy i am to be assigned to the enterprise  it wasnt just luck i requested it  i know i can be of great help to the ship  yes of course just follow mr crusher  yes sir  cmdr riker report to the phaser range please  on my way  i wondered if you had any feelings about  the officer exchange programme initiated by starfleet  just positive ones sir  actually i just welcomed ensign mendon on board  he seems eager to please  well thats a benzite trait  its been suggested an officer from the enterprise might participate  thats probably a good idea  well there is a klingon vessel in the area  i dont recall a federation officer ever serving on a klingon vessel  no neither do i  it might prove beneficial  having worf on board certainly has been  yes sir  who did you intend to send sir  i thought of asking for a volunteer   i might be interested sir  damn sorry what was that  i wouldnt mind the assignment sir  any particular reason  because nobodys ever done it before  ill inform star base of your acceptance  theyll contact the klingons make the arrangements  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  captains log stardate 425065  we have departed from star base 179  and are headed for a rendezvous with the klingon vessel pagh  i have informed the staff of cmdr rikers temporary assignment  i have studied everything about my heritage  just the man i need to talk to  is it true that a klingon first officer must assassinate his captain  yes sir   wouldnt that bring about chaos  of course not  when or if the captain becomes weak or unable to perform  it is expected that his honourable retirement be assisted by his first  your second officer will assassinate you for the same reasons  must take a little getting used to  the klingon system has operated successfully for centuries  it is different  many things will be different  can i help you sir  a wonderful way to maintain constant control over defensive shields  but im sure theres a way to improve response time  sorry didnt mean to interrupt you  just thought i could be of some help  however i am correct in what i said  that is superb designing absolutely firstrate  yes it is would you care to be more specific  the input sampling its simple yet efficient enough  a minor change of the helm readout  would be more helpful in emergency situations  weve never had problems with it have you seen it work  not in a practical exercise  but in theory  my theory  it would be more than a marginal improvement  ill mention it to the captain  he is open to astute observations isnt he  ive never known the captain not to listen to his officers  outstanding soon well get things running perfectly  what is that  a klingon delicacy  pipius claw this is heart of targ  this of course is gagh   yes serpent worms like some  no thanks  i never heard of a klingon starving on his own vessel but you might   not if i weaken first  their beliefs are rather brutal  but usually what kills us kills them  thats good to know like something to drink  ill abstain in honour of your last hour on board  your sacrifice will not go unnoticed  im aware of the feast before the transfer  ive done it dozens of times  however i usually made more palatable choices  well these are the more palatable choices  thank you  we know so little about them there really is so much to learn  this is a great opportunity  i envy you mr riker  thank you  commander  an emergency transponder  altered to give an omni directional signal and an emergency call   you suspect trouble  a security precaution  i want to ensure your return to this ship  sentiment lt worf  efficiency commander  i understand thank you  we have a klingon vessel approaching   hailing frequencies  open  they are returning our hail in proper language it is the pagh  on view screen  im capt picard of the uss enterprise  this is capt kargan of the klingon vessel the pagh  beam your first officer on board immediately  we are preparing to do so  and captain you are getting a fine officer  thank you for your opinion but i will judge that for myself  screen off  not very hospitable are they  that is not your concern observe your station ensign mendon  didnt mean to offend you  you didnt yet  transporter prepare to beam cmdr riker to the pagh  acknowledged captain   mr data you have the bridge  aye sir   good luck commander  thanks obrien   i wouldnt wanna go  why   youre not afraid are you  no im not  i would be ready sir  thanks  energize   resume course mr crusher  aye sir  take over cmdr data ill be in observation  sir  i am ensign mendon  i just wanted to tell you how pleased i am to be aboard  yes of course good to have you aboard  if you have a few minutes ive noted a few procedural changes  which might speed up bridge operations  i pick things up very fast  of course you do you have an excellent record  however on the enterprise we use the chain of command  you will report your observations to lt worf  i beg your pardon i just wanted to impress upon  no need to apologize we should have explained at your indoctrination  ensign mendon  you may impress me   is something wrong  no  its just  ive never seen anyone of your species before  im just an average everyday human who happens to be a commander   now what were your orders  to escort you to the captain   proceed  yes commander  cmdr william riker of the starship enterprise  that is incorrect  i dont understand  you are cmdr william riker  first officer of the klingon cruiser the pagh  or do you intend to disobey federation orders  i have no such intention sir  exactly where are your loyalties commander  im afraid i still dont understand sir  this ship is equipped with our best weapons and our finest warriors  we are on a peaceful mission but can be ready for battle instantly  i know i can count on every klingon warrior in this crew  to serve and die in that battle  so i ask you again cmdr riker where are your loyalties  i have been assigned to serve this ship and to obey your orders  i will do exactly that  will you take an oath to that effect  i just did  this is your second officer lt klag  something you wanted to say to me lieutenant  yes sir  i do not believe you  then you challenge my authority over you  correct  and your position on this captain  i would say it is your first command decision  my oath is between capt kargan and myself  your only concern is with how you obey my orders  or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to lieutenant  i will take your orders  and you cmdr riker will obey my orders  of course capt kargan  sir automatic scan has registered an unknown substance  on the aft quarter of the exterior skin dorsal section   target it and define  aye sir  ive located it sir dorsal of the engineering section  view screen on  focus on area  magnification factor ten  increase magnification to 50  analyze  it appears to be a rare form of subatomic bacteria  capable of doubling itself in size every 15 minutes  its reacting with two compounds present in the ships structure   origin  captain  i noticed it when i did an intensive scan of the pagh  the klingon ship  and whom did you inform  no one i have not yet completed my full analysis  you should report whatever is out of the ordinary  and i think that falls into this category  but sir i have not completed my full analysis  it would be improper to report it until then  how did you come to that decision  it is a benzite regulation  no officer on our ships would report an occurrence like this  without a full analysis and a resolution  i have simply followed proper procedures  it is our procedure ensign  to notify command of any possible danger to the ship  the decision is not yours do you understand  yes sir  now continue your analysis and determine the danger  not only to our ship but to the klingon vessel also  yes captain that will take a couple of hours  use whatever resources are necessary  we may have encountered a new life form  i want to know everything about it quickly cmdr data supervise  aye sir  and then i will instruct you in enterprise etiquette  first officers personal log  i have been aboard the pagh a short time  but am impressed with the klingons abilities and singlemindedness  commander youre not eating very much  im not that hungry   is the food alright commander  delicious  the pipius claw was excellent and the bregit lung  and the rokeg blood pie  delicious  good then youll also enjoy this  isnt that gagh  very good you did some research on our nutritional choices  yes but   its still moving  gagh is always best served live  would you like something easier  easier  yes if klingon food is too strong for you  perhaps we could get one of the females to breastfeed you  youre not worried about my weakening are you  look around you there are no old warriors  no sir im sure they all died with honour  exactly  you may live long enough to learn about us  he is not very attractive  but i will have him  they are inquisitive  they want to know how you would endure  endure what  them  one or both  i may be back for you   is she serious  yes  commander would you say youre a typical federation officer  i suppose so why   well youre not what i expected  in what way  you have a sense of humour  i was thinking the same about you  in all my dealings with klingons including our lt worf  the thought never occurred to me of klingons laughing  there is much about us you do not know   thats why im here  you should ask  i may after this tour i may have some worthy questions  questions about what  about our future our future is honour  our present is serving this ship  like you i have a mother and a father  they look like me i look like them  are they still alive  my mother lives my father was killed in battle at tranome sar  and your father  my father  my father was captured in battle by romulans and not allowed to die  he eventually escaped  where is he now  he is on our planet  he waits  he waits for his death  he will fade of a natural illness and die weakened and useless  honourless  i will not see him  hes your father  a klingon is his work not his family  that is the way of things  hes your father  klingons do not express feeling the way you do  perhaps you should  we would not know how  yesterday i did not know how to eat gagh  i can confirm the organisms feed on compounds in the enterprises hull   and the klingon ship the pagh  they are more susceptible  their hull contains more of the compounds  projection  at this rate of reproduction there should be  a 12centimeter opening in the klingon hull  signal them at once they may be unaware of it and need help  aye sir   change course to intercept  aye sir  it will take time to locate them  they are on manoeuvres in the pheben system  find them  tell me cmdr riker what do you make of this  i felt no collision were we hit by a meteor  no collision   corrosion then  no not corrosion   science station analyse  we have  fortunately that section could with stand the change in pressure  then what is it  a space organism eating away at our hull  what are you talking about surely you can repair it  im afraid not  we estimate that in less than eight hours  we will have lost too much shell to remain intact  our only contact recently was with the enterprise  there was no direct contact with the enterprise  tactics officer report to cmdr riker  the enterprise did conduct an extensive scan of this vessel  normal procedure  what type of beam did the enterprise use to cause this damage to us  none why would they were allies  my logs show that the enterprise directed an intense scanning beam  at this specific area for a duration of two minutes  explain that  i cant  it could be a weapon  its no weapon  the enterprise has no reason to do that it makes no sense why  why is no longer important  what is important is our response to this attack  engage cloaking device set course to intercept the enterprise  what do you intend to do captain  intend there is only one response  i intend to attack the enterprise and destroy it  youre making progress  youve eliminated half the possibilities already  thank you but i seem to have become efficient after it was needed  it was my responsibility to learn and adapt  to the enterprises regulations and i didnt do that  not really you just made an error  capt picard may not like them but he knows they turn up sometimes  ive failed i had an opportunity to show the captain  my superior capabilities and i failed  i can never recover from that  mendon it was a mistake  you didnt put the organism on the hull you discovered it  you were trying to analyse it and messed up on protocol a little  i realise you are being nice to me and i appreciate it  what i dont understand is why  why not i thought you could use a friend  thank you  i hope i can learn your ways before i mess up again  i imagine my methods must seem foolish to you  theyre different  but thats what this exchange is all about  you learn how we do things and take that back to your command  its up to them to decide which is better  youre right ill do it your way  ill work even harder than before and ill succeed brilliantly  what is the status  unchanged the rate of increase continues  cmdr riker check the organism growth with engineering  keep him under scrutiny  captain im not convinced riker knew of any plot against us  if he did why would he have come on board   because he was ordered to  to die  its the expectation of any officer to be ordered to die at any time  for a klingon perhaps  but rikers people do not volunteer for death so easily  he may be a spy   but hes no coward  that only proves that hes intelligent  and you might not be as strong as you used to be  ive picked up the enterprise  so soon  the enterprise is on an intercept course with us  you almost had me believing this was a misunderstanding  but  the enterprise has changed course and is following us why   ask them  the reason is obvious  their intent is clear   how long before we make contact  less than 15 minutes  put the ship on full battle alert arm all photon torpedoes  let them charge into their destruction  captain bearings show we should be in contact with the pagh now   slow to impulse  aye sir impulse speed  hailing frequencies are open there is no response  continue transmission  the pagh is either cloaked or destroyed sir  conduct an intensive scan of the area  enterprise has slowed to impulse it is making an intensive sweep  hold your position let them come to us  they may be here to help you dont be a fool  do not forget my rank  i havent i am simply trying to help you understand  i understand fully  now you understand i am still captain of this vessel  you are still crew and sworn to obey me you gave me your oath  yes sir i did  then fulfil that oath and serve this ship as you swore to  tell me of the surest method of attack against the enterprise  i wont  you must it is a matter of honour and loyalty to your oath  i will not surrender the secrets of the enterprise to you  if your word is no good then how can we ever trust starfleet  i will not break a vow i made in the past  i also made an oath to your ship i will not break that   they are in conflict  no sir they are not  i will obey your orders i will serve as first officer  in an attack against the enterprise i will die with this crew  but i will not break my oath of loyalty to starfleet  if you had told those secrets about the enterprise  i would have labelled you a traitor and killed you where you stood  but instead you will die with us  youll die like a klingon  sir i have something to report immediately   go ahead ensign  i have isolated the organisms  they are a submicron form  capable of breaking nuclear bonds in the tritanium  can they be removed from the hull  yes they are controllable and can be removed from both ships  by using a tunnelling neutrino beam  thank you ensign well done initiate that procedure  lieutenant add that information to the hailing messages  aye sir  lieutenant  the enterprise has changed hailing message  it promises help in cleaning the organisms and in repairs  i told you theyre here to help  i do not believe them  arm all weapons prepare to attack  captains log stardate 425078  although our search has been extensive  we are still unable to locate the klingon ship  or any evidence of its destruction  considering the absence of debris  one must assume the klingon vessel is in the area and cloaked  agreed  since we do not know its intent i recommend we go to red alert   make it so lieutenant  aye sir  the enterprise has raised its shields  a normal procedure in a suspicious situation  its not an act of aggression they will not fire first  then they are fools  for we will   youll get only one shot  well only need one  stand by on phasers and torpedoes prepare to fire them simultaneously  i recommend you dont fire until youre within 40000 km  why  to cut down their response time  you are honouring your promise to serve us  would you do less  you will give the order to fire cmdr riker  call out distances  any questions mr riker  id like to say i question your judgement  in my opinion your reason for this confrontation is not valid  are you finished  yes sir  commence with attack as ordered   is that a weapon commander  no sir  give it to me  we are receiving an emergency signal from a command transponder  location 035 mark 313  frequency and code designate cmdr riker  chief obrien lock on to that signal  yes captain were not yet in safe range for a transfer   defensive shields remain in place  we may have to stretch it  we must know whats going on and only cmdr riker can tell us  beam him directly onto the bridge on my command  yes sir ill wait till 40000    transporter room stand by   you control the shields  ready sir    prepare to drop cloaking shields and fire when ready  steady  transporter room energize  hold where you are klag ive relieved capt kargan  he was acting in an irrational manner  im your captain now  where am i  aboard the starship enterprise  riker has no honour  he tricked me   he is only dazed sir  well thats fine   but wheres cmdr riker  cloaking shields off   obey my orders  we will be destroyed  if we are it will be in battle and i will die with you  so i repeat cloaking shields off  it is the pagh sir  it has all armament locked on us and ready to fire  hold position hailing frequencies  enterprise to pagh we are here to assist do not fire  they will not believe you  pagh were here to assist do you read me  enterprise this is capt william riker of the klingon vessel pagh  i order you to lower your shields and surrender  lower shields  surrender as ordered  i demand to be beamed back aboard my vessel  transporter chief prepare to beam capt kargan aboard the pagh  aye sir  capt riker we can carry out your repairs immediately  thank you capt picard   you should have killed me  i dont want your command   but you tricked me to get it  either way you can have it back  then return to your station  get him off my ship  yes captain  you understand the klingons better than i thought commander  thank you my friend  almost the shortest assignment in the history of starfleet  wrong number one it was almost the longest well done  thank you i learned quite a bit  apparently not when to duck  when not to duck would be more accurate  welcome aboard number one  lieutenant conduct the commander to sickbay  aye sir  commander  your little toy worked thanks  im glad it did  you come from a very brave and unique people  im glad youre with us on the enterprise  thank you commander and  welcome home
