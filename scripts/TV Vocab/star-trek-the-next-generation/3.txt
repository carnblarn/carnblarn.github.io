                captains log stardate 412092  we are going to rendezvous with a science vessel ss tsiolkovsky  which has been monitoring the collapse of a red supergiant star  into a white dwarf  what has brought us here is a series of strange messages  indicating something has gone wrong aboard the research vessel  ss tsiolkovsky repeat your message  hello enterprise welcome  i hope you have a lot of pretty boys there  because im willing and waiting  in fact were going to have a real blowout here  do it yeah go ahead do it  captain what weve just heard is impossible  report  i believe that last sound was an emergency hatch being blown  are you certain yes of course you are  data geordi tasha  searcher scans now reveal no life signs aboard captain  cover the ship as planned move out  indications of what humans would call a wild party  yeah  their bridge  if this works be sure to record everything  you were right somebody blew out the hatch  they were all sucked out into space  correction sir thats blown out   thank you data  a common mistake sir  cmdr riker lt yar location engineering  ten people here sir all frozen no vital signs  frozen how  it looks like someone was playing with the environmental controls  just let all the heat bleed away into space  sir lt la forge in the crew quarters  something in here  riker to captain i have a report sir  picard here  theyre all dead  some of them were blown out of the emergency hatches  but there were 80 people on that ship  yes sir  as i said all dead  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  captains log supplemental we are downloading information  gathered on the collapsing star nearby  im concerned at being in such close orbit  but the tsiolkovskys research records should predict  the time of the stars final collapse  i cant find anything unusual in the readings they sent over  give me a theory doctor anything  madness mass hysteria delusion  any or all captain  alright lets bring the away team back  set the transporter to maximum decontamination  and then full examination and observation when theyre here  if you were any more perfect id put you in a medical textbook  im already listed in several biomechanical texts  yes of course  youre next lieutenant  normal all across  except why are you perspiring lieutenant  because you have it too hot in here what else would it be  it doesnt sound like you geordi  well maybe its not maybe she threw her voice  hey it was a joke  of course but i would like to run a few more tests on you lieutenant   sickbay to bridge  picard here go ahead doctor  im confining lt la forge to sickbay until further notice   do we have a problem doctor  i dont know yet  i need help in locating some library computer information  specifics sir  i have a vague memory of reading somewhere  about someone taking a shower in their clothing  ah the body geordi discovered   i believe its happened before  to someone somewhere  this should be easy for someone written up in biomechanical texts  about that sir did the doctor believe i was boasting  probably   this may take some time  several hours  what i said was a statement of fact perhaps she will look it up  you can depend on it  geordi  security lt la forge left sickbay while i was in my office  he doesnt have his communicator we must find him  security team pick up lt la forge he just left sickbay  captain anything further  affirmative make it a shipwide search lieutenant  its a model of the ships tractor beam with my ideas added  thats your science project wes youre really something  since the captain wont let me on the bridge  i use this to imagine im there  take the helm mr crusher  set a course for 37 mark 180 warp six   its the captains voice  its words he used on the intercom  i can pretend hes ordering me to take the enterprise anywhere  listen to this  chief engineer report to the bridge  cmdr riker report to the bridge  dr crusher report to the bridge  what dyou think  i think the captains lucky youre on his side  but he still wont let me on the bridge  theres nothing there i dont understand  i wish i understood myself that well  are you ok  no suddenly i i seem to be burning up inside  its so hot in here  geordi  geordi  lt yar in the observation lounge send a team now   medicals worried about you  help me  help me to not give in to the wild things in my mind  my job is security  tasha please  alright  helping is more important geordi how can i help you  help me to see like you do  but you already see better than i can  i see more  but more isnt better  geordi please  i wanna see in shallow dim beautiful human ways  well talk about it geordi  now im gonna take you to sickbay   alright  yeah  ok  good  we got him to sickbay so dr crusher could examine him  he wasnt violent  no sir he was very upset  he kept talking about wanting normal vision  thank you lieutenant  our readouts still show nothing wrong with him  he looks to have a temperature but our instruments say not  doctor every person on that ship died  is there any chance that whatever did it is loose on my ship  if you mean a disease id say no chance  we used full decontamination we examined every team member  the entire crew somehow managed to kill themselves doctor  if not a disease what else made them do it  alternatives are in the areas of insanity and severe emotional upset  troi do you feel anything unusual in the lieutenant  security told me that he was longing for normal sight  thats a sudden yearning  his records show no previous mention of that  the fact that it happened now could be important  but all i sense from him is confusion  if i didnt know better id say he was intoxicated  our tests wouldve shown that  or any signs of drugs hallucinogens or contaminants  can you provide more information sir  seeking an instance of someone showering in clothing is  its like looking for a needle in a haystack  why should anyone expend time in such a search  i shouldve said proverbial needle in a haystack  ah a human proverb as in folklore   or an historical allusion  historical thats it  i was reading about all the past starships named enterprise  enterprise history aberrant behavior  medical crossreference  captain i think we have the answer to what happened  the starship enterprise capt james t kirk commanding  similar conditions  they were monitoring a planet that was breaking up  not a collapsing star as in this case  but there were the same huge shifts in gravity  which resulted in complex strings of water molecules  which acquired carbon from the body and acted  acted on the brain like alcohol  data download this information to medical  downloading  fascinating the entire crew going out of control  like intoxication but worse judgment almost completely impaired  until they found this formula barely in time  picard to dr crusher come in   this is crusher go ahead  you can relax  the answer is feeding into your medical banks right now  including a cure  are you certain captain  absolutely  tasha  what are you doing  i need your advice thats why i came to your quarters  of course anything  on clothes you always wear such beautiful clothes off duty  and your hair always looks so nice  i wanna change my image what do you think about this  or or this one  its not for you  tasha i feel youre very uncertain  that youre fighting something what is it  never mind  ill find what i need myself  ships stores will have it  tasha wait   troi to capt picard  picard here  sir i think tashas been infected too   she just left my quarters  its not actually an infection  yes sir its more like an intoxication  but whatever it is shes got it  thank you counselor  number one  it seems our security chief has the equivalent of a snootful  inquiry sir snootful  forget it  hey mom look what i can do  ive widened and strengthened the beam like i said last night  do me a favor somethings happening on this ship  just to be safe stay in our quarters until its solved  sure mom your wish is my command  now wes  ok but you could be stunting my emotional growth you realize that  why is it so hot in here  picard to crusher  crusher here  have you made a test injection yet  we have indications that this condition is spreading  no test yet captain but very soon  in 41 minutes the information from the tsiolkovsky will be downloaded  why so slow  slow sir the tsiolkovsky has been eight months in accumulating it  how much danger from that star worst case  like a full collapse sir  any material it threw this way  we could outrun on half impulse power  picard to engineering chief engineer report to the bridge  assistant chief engineer shimoda report to medical  hi jim was that the captain ordering you to medical  which would leave no one on duty the chief was summoned to the bridge  what about me  i could call the chief on the bridge if anything happened   reporting as ordered sir  what  you ordered me to report to the bridge sir  i did no such thing  i want you in the engine room in case we need to move out  attention all divisions effective immediately  i have handed over control to acting captain wesley crusher  acting captain  thank you capt picard  and so dawns a brave new day for the enterprise  captains log stardate 412093  the contaminant that led to the deaths of the tsiolkovsky crew  is now aboard the enterprise  our engineering section  has been commandeered by young wesley crusher  and henceforth a dessert course shall precede and follow every meal  including breakfast  hurray for the acting captain  never got as far as sickbay wes i feel too good for that  incredible how did you do that  hooked my model tractor beam into the ships power  now its a repulser beam too want in  swear to be faithful to you captain  number one macdougal get that boy out of engineering  sir im getting very strange reports from all decks  such as  such as the training division giving a lecture on metaphysics   metaphysics  confirmed sir  a rather peculiar limerick was being delivered in the shuttlecraft bay  im not sure i understand it  there was a young lady from venus whose body was shaped like a  captain to security come in   did i say something wrong  i dont understand their humor   yeah captain  get me lt yar   keep your britches on  capt picard  lieutenant where are you  im in my quarters im pretty busy right at the moment  jeanluc  alright lieutenant you just stay right there  data take lt yar down to sickbay   aye sir  captain to security  i want all your senior supervisors to report to the bridge immediately  lt yar  here data  you wanted me  capt picard ordered me to escort you to sickbay lieutenant  did he say when  im sure he meant now so you should get into uniform  but i got out of my uniform for you data  do you know how old i was when i was abandoned  chronological age  no im afraid i am not familiar with  five  five years old but i survived  i learned how to stay alive  how to avoid the rape gangs  i was 15 before i escaped  i am sorry i did not know  and what i want now is gentleness  and joy  and love  from you data you are fully functional   of course but  how fully  in every way of course  i am programmed in multiple techniques  a broad variety of pleasuring  oh you jewel thats exactly what i hoped  what have you learned  the engines are cut off from the bridge  an engineer pulled out the isolinear optical chips from command  all the engines are off line  wesley has hooked up some kind of tractor beam  to the ships power aimed at the door  we cant get past to get to the computer  can you short out the power  yes i can but its gonna take time  do it  bill  deanna what  so many minds on this ship all free  released  deanna  i can feel them all  what they want what they feel  its a side of humans i never felt before  come on im getting you to sickbay  wouldnt you rather be alone with me with me in your mind  the medical records we found say this works almost instantly  its not fair doc  ive never seen a rainbow sunset sunrise  this is gonna help me  help me see like you  dr crusher   deanna needs your help  the formula didnt work  it may induce the same symptoms but somehow its different  maybe its mutated i have to isolate it to analyze it   we dont have time  you brought deanna in  then you touched her oh god and you touched me  ive got to quarantine you  if i dont get the computer on line none of this will matter  well all be dead  captains log supplemental  it is no longer an inconvenient childish prank  young wesley crusher  admittedly a victim of the tsiolkovsky infection  is now in control of my starship  wesley this is capt picard do you see me  yes sir  you will return control of this vessel to the bridge  where it belongs at once  im sorry sir tell me what you want done and ill do it  ship captains control their own vessels young man  but sir you dont do it yourself  you give the orders but somebody else does it  whats wrong with giving me the orders  captain getting unusual readings now from the dwarf star  stand by on that for a moment  wesley  wes  are you aware that you are behaving strangely  that a kind of infection was brought over from the tsiolkovsky  which acts like intoxication  are you saying thats why i feel so hot so strange  thats  thats a very adult bit of reasoning wesley  so you mean im drunk  i feel strange but also good  because you have lost the capacity for selfjudgment  now alcohol does this wesley  the contaminant from the tsiolkovsky does it even more so  what would you do if you got your ship back  oh its very important i do wesley  i must lock a tractor beam on to the tsiolkovsky and tow it  tractor beams are my specialty ill get that done wesley out  wesley  where are you headed  sir the star its beginning to collapse  what the hell is happening in engineering  lock on  lock on tsiolkovsky   wheres that sonic driver  its over there  ok lets see if this cuts out his tractor beam power  oh come on  no  i must find the answer  ive got to find the answer  captain tractor beam we just locked on to the tsiolkovsky  captain to  wesley wesley crusher come in  good data   at least youre functioning  fully captain  data intoxication is a human condition your brain is different  its not the same as  were more alike than unlike my dear captain  i have pores humans have pores  i have fingerprints  humans have fingerprints  my chemical nutrients are like your blood  if you prick me  do i not leak  doctor  captain can i see you in your room its private   no actually its urgent  but  damn it   now doctor  i have become infected myself  do you know what the infection is  come on quickly  sorry it is definitely like alcohol intoxication  the same lack of good judgment  for example right now i find you extremely  extremely  we havent time for that sort of thing   what sort of thing  god would i love to show you  doctor there must be a cure some formula  similar to the old one  damn it captain  my dear captain  you owe me something you do realize that dont you  im a woman i havent had the comfort of a husband a man  not now doctor please  bridge to riker urgent   riker here  sir  regret to inform you  that the captain appears to be infected and data  thank you lieutenant im on my way youll have to handle this  are you saying youre gonna handle that  what were seeing is a huge chunk of the star surface blown away  heading for us  take us  are you alright sir  worf you do know what to do  take us er   take us out of here  right   controls are still off line sir  override  same result sir  wes come in please  wesley crusher this is riker  this is urgent come in please  engineering urgent we must have ships power  these are control chips   bridge from engineering  the star is collapsing   were in the path  i cant help you  someone yanked out the control chips  it was an adult who did it  i estimate 14 minutes until that mass gets here  no sir i cannot replace the chips in 14 minutes two hours maybe  data could assemble them faster  whats that whats that wesley  theyre simple isolinear chips to data  he can shuffle them like cards  come on data hurry  ships log first officer riker enterprise will be destroyed  unless it is moved out of the path of the star material  our only hope is for lt cmdr data in the time we have left  to reconnect engine power to the bridge   nice to see you wesley  hi mr data  get the damn control chips back in place in the correct order now  its like a game how fast can you do it  a game  i think i can switch this to main viewer sir  data weve eight or nine minutes can you finish by then  no this will take slightly more time than we have sir  damn it no i cant afford to get this  beverly  yes jeanluc  you will address me as captain  captain  well then my dear captain  you will address me as chief medical officer or doctor  i will thats true  i started out by calling you beverly of course naturally you  im still not thinking straight  likewise where the hell was i headed  if thats something you were going to test  yes on geordi come here  see how i reversed the fields on this  i made it into a repulser beam  if we just had one minute more sir  if this were a hundred times more powerful than it is  why not try it with the real thing  why not reverse fields we need an extra minute  it would take weeks of laying out new circuits  why not just see it in your head  come off the main lead split off at the force activator  then  if i could just think straight about this  i made this a broaderbased remedy i hope  its still very close to the formula from the old enterprise records  decades ago light years away  but almost exactly the same conditions as here  wow what was in that doctor  my head is beginning to clear  come here  take this to engineering  ill make up hypos for the others  ok bev  were not gonna make it captain  if we only had a minute or so more  then reverse in power leads back through the force activator  repulser beam hard against tsiolkovsky  dont you see its giving us a pushoff  the extra time we need  were pushing away  bridge engage engines  captain something seemed to move us aside at the last minute  do we owe our thanks to cmdr data sir  yes and wesley may have given us a few seconds too  did he say wesley the boy  he said wesley  its only fair to mention wesley in the log entry sir  fairs fair  lets credit his science teacher too   congratulations sir  to many people  data im only going to tell you this just once  it never happened  i put it to you all  i think we shall end up with a fine crew  if we avoid temptation  so number one lets go to our next job  aye sir  prepare for warp three  headed 294 mark 37  warp three heading 294 mark 37 sir  engage
