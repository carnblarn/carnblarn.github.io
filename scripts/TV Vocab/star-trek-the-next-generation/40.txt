                captains log stardate 426953  we are the first manned vessel to enter the selcundi drema sector  probes have recorded unusual levels of geological activity  in all five planetary systems  i hope the enterprise will find the answer to this enigma  commander i have been reviewing the unmannedprobe scans  at some point in the last 150 years  the fifth planet of selcundi drema shattered forming an asteroid belt  id call that geological instability  was it caused by an unknown intelligence  this is geology not malevolence these planets live fast die hard  the question is why  you wont reconsider  no ill just watch you and be impressed  an optimistic vote of confidence from a nonrider  i never thought of you as an animal person  small animals no but horses  program the holodeck for a woodland setting  with a bridle path and an appropriate mount  type andorian zabathu klingon sark  earth horse   breed  arabian  the arabs believed allah gathered the south wind and made the horse  on the holodeck weve made that legend come true  i like that  computer english tack and i will control the animal myself  enter when ready   you like horses for the romance  it goes deeper than that  a fine warhorse would sleep in a bedouins tent carry him in battle  feed his children with her milk  there is a bond which is created by mutual need   hello beautiful  now i understand  you dont want the comfort of a pet you want a companion  thank you  i dont want to anthropomorphize anything  it seems that some creatures have the capacity  to fill spaces you never knew were empty  i had a betazoid kitten once  my mother and the cat reacted badly to one another  sure you dont want to try its very relaxing  we can find you something quiet and gentle  no i prefer my mode of transport not to have a mind of its own  strange  i would expect betazoids to be outstanding animal trainers  we become too involved in the shifting passions of the beast  we lose our way and get swept up in emotion  i would have thought this beast would be far more terrifying  captain  yes number one  were in the first system you should be here   something interesting  spectacular a little terrifying  im on my way  the first longrange reading magnification ten to the sixth   impressive  and deadly  the last unmanned probe showed a thriving ecosystem  now theres nothing  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  this is cmdr rikers meeting  i need your advice  im responsible for overseeing wesleys education  i would like to put him in charge of the planetary mineral surveys  its a big job with a lot of responsibility  the game should scare you a little  wesleys going to need a team it takes presence to lead is he ready  leadership grows from selfconfidence  which is also part of a starfleet officers education  all true but theres an old horsetrainers adage  about putting too much weight on a young back  we dont want him to break under pressure  were shifting focus here  are we discussing a young officer on a fasttrack to the academy  or a young man we are guiding through adolescence into adulthood  you cant guide someone into adulthood  the experiences are unique to each person  whether wes succeeds or fails he will learn from the experience  i agree im just questioning the speed at which were moving   you think were pushing too hard  its a valid concern  tempering is taken to extremes   he is a boy not a sword  who will one day become a man  and to extend the metaphor hell need a fine edge  that wont dull at the first touch of resistance  eventually he has to feel the burden of command  ensign crusher report to the observation lounge  wesley youre assigned command of the planetary mineral surveys  sir  thank you sir  wait till you see how much work it entails  assemble a team look at records of the drema quadrant  theres a mystery here weve got to solve it  yes sir a team sir  this is a serious responsibility  i know sir  these officers are here to assist you not judge  help you make use of them they are a valuable resource  and by the way i respect an officer  who is prepared to admit ignorance and ask a question  rather than one who out of pride will blunder blindly forward  i understand sir  ensign  youre dismissed  ill try not to disappoint you   is this part of your duties  no a personal project  i have reset the sensors to scan for frequencies outside the usual range  such as  dips and peaks of the galaxys magnetic field  organic molecules and nebular clouds cosmic rays  interesting would these scans detect artificial transmissions  as well as natural signals   of course  good  those signals are faint and hard to distinguish from background noise  hence i am boosting the power  i will move that to my quarters  good   hi can i walk with you  yes   i need advice  its free   walking or advice  both  its my team im considering so many factors im confusing myself  what have you done  broken down the task and picked the best people  prixus in mineralogy and metallurgy  alans and hildebrandt for volcanology and geomechanics davies but  but theyre all older than you  right it makes me feel strange what about personality conflicts  theyre professionals  if theres a personality conflict you settle it  so you have to understand the job and be counsellor  sometimes  well  thank you  captains log stardate 426963  we are entering the second selcundi star system  where acting ensign crusher will begin his planetary mineral survey  the results may help unlock the geological puzzle   ensign davies  you got him  wesley crusher  im leading the geological surveys id like you on my team  sounds great who else is on it  i have prixus and alans and hildebrandt  shame you didnt talk to me first  its just personal opinion but i like to break up married teams   i hadnt thought of that  dont worry theyll be fine  and if you need any help just give me a signal and ill take over  cant get too beat up on your first command  thanks but im pretty sure ill be alright  computer identify please  sensors indicate lowlevel rf waves   is there a pattern  affirmative   naturally occurring  negative  key universal translator  unable to comply weak signal   lock on comm link and boost  lockon complete  read please  insufficient signal strength  enhance please  is anybody out there  yes  wes  hi dr pulaski   you have trouble behind that door  my teams in there  i have to assign planets set a schedule  sounds like its under control  i havent had to deal with them professionally  the minute you walk through that door theyre your team  you have nothing to prove you have the authority   only cos cmdr riker says so  its up to you to hang on to it  now youd better get in there and wes  for what its worth i think youre gonna do fine  captains log stardate 427373  it has been six weeks since our entrance into selcundi drema  each system has revealed  the same disturbing geological upheavals on every planet  this is where we can expect the greatest tectonic stresses  i agree nice job  my scan results on the third selcundi system  its just the same old song  didnt you say that uv absorptions indicate traker deposits  where theres traker theres usually dilithium   we should run an icospectogram  these readings are really faint   i think id still run an icogram  its a major undertaking   itd be five hours minimum  i dont want a halfway job  theres being thorough and theres wasting time  a good officer will recognize the difference  maybe youre right  computer access volcanic and tectonicplate activity in drema iv  accessing  computer locate capt picard  capt picard is on holodeck three  data  an excellent steed sir  sorry to disturb you  its alright it must be important  yes sir it is important very  eight weeks ago i received a transmission a fourword message  is anybody out there  i answered it  there is  a loneliness inherent in that whisper from the darkness  yes sir i am glad you understand sir  but it didnt end there  no sir we speak often it is a young female humanoid  her society is aware that there is interstellar life  no sir  where does she think youre calling from  i have kept that vague  but sarjenka that is her name has been quite specific  giving details of her family and friends  interspersed among these have been some alarming references  go on  drema iv endures the same geological stresses  we have found in the other systems  then your friend is in trouble what are you proposing  if we can determine the cause of these disturbances  we might be able to reverse the process  violate the prime directive  i was hoping you might have another option sir  we dont even know if this catastrophe is preventable  call a conference in my quarters all senior staff   yes sir  and data  all communication with this life form must cease  yes i understand sir  seeing the look on his face  ill get you another drink  two more  thank you  family emergency  you dont look like you came to relax  i didnt i need your advice  yesterday when ensign davies turned in the survey  i asked for an icospectogram he didnt agree   dyou think you were right  yes  i guess i could have just been picking nits  or been intimidated its tough to tell people what to do  i suppose i could have made it an order  but how do you order someone older and more experienced  the difference in ages between you two is not the issue   i guess not  might it have to do with ego  no its the opposite of ego  every time i give an order i think  what makes my judgement so superior to these peoples  wes responsibility and authority go hand in hand  i know youre responsible now you need to learn authority  you were given command so you can make some right decisions  which will lead to a pattern of success and build selfconfidence  if you dont trust your own judgement you dont belong in command  what if im wrong  its arrogant to think youll never make a mistake  but what if its something really important not a mineral survey  what if somebody dies because i made a mistake  in your position its important to ask yourself one question  what would picard do  hed listen to everyone then make his own decision but hes captain  so is his decision ever questioned   no way  and why not  im not sure  cmdr riker report to the captains quarters  when you figure it out youll understand command  im on my way did that help tell me what you decide  ive decided im going to have davies run that icogram   thank you sir  youre welcome   ill see you later  ok  ensign davies  i want that icospectogram on selcundi drema  you got it  it is not a matter of how wrong data was or why he did it  the dilemma exists we have to discuss the options  and please talk freely  there are no options the prime directive is not a matter of degrees  it is an absolute  i have a problem with that rigidity  it seems callous and even cowardly  im sure that is not what the lieutenant meant  but in such a situation we must be cautious  what we do today may profoundly affect the future  if we could see every possible outcome  wed be gods which were not  if there is a cosmic plan is it not the height of hubris  to think that we should interfere   so the dremans are fated to die  we should consider that option  considered and rejected  are we not a part of any cosmic plan  our presence here at this time could be a part of fate  and we could be meant to interfere  that eliminates the possibility of fate  but commander the dremans are not a subject for philosophical debate  they are a people  we make an exception in the deaths of millions  yes  is it the same situation if its an epidemic not a geological calamity   absolutely  what about war  if generations of conflict is killing millions do we interfere  well were all a little less secure in our moral certitude  what if its not just killings  if an oppressive government is enslaving millions  the prime directive has many different functions  not the least of which is to protect us  to prevent us from allowing emotions to overwhelm our judgement  my emotions are involved  datas friend is going to die that means something  to data  does that invalidate the emotion  what if they asked for help  yes sarjenkas transmission could be viewed as a call for help  sophistry  ill buy that excuse were jigging madly on the head of a pin anyway  she cannot ask for help from someone she does not know  she knows me  what a perfectly vicious little circle  we are going to allow her to die are we not  data i want you to sever the contact with drema iv  isolating frequency  data where are you why wont you answer  are you angry with me please im so afraid  where are you  wait  your whisper from the dark has now become a plea  we cannot turn our backs  captains log stardate 427413  we are entering into orbit of drema iv  the planet from which data received the signal  sensors indicate that volcanic activity is increasing  we found the reason for the instability  we wouldve missed it if crusher hadnt requested an icogram  drema iv has the largest deposit of dilithium ore ever recorded  its laid out in an unusual pattern  the crystals form perfectly aligned lattices   the ore forms generator strata  creating a piezoelectric effect  in plain english the dilithium is causing the geological catastrophe  the crystals take the planets heat  and turn it into mechanical energy   it increases tectonic stresses  that tear the planet apart  then the crystals break down which is why we found traces of illium 629  that takes care of why now what can you do  that is going to take more work  can you reverse the process  we think so  no no theories no halfanswers yes or no  well get to work on it  sir  datas out there now monitoring the condition on drema iv  the situations desperate for his friend  hes calculated the safest place on the planets surface  you can guess why  were just getting deeper and deeper in arent we  shes going to die they all are   unless  yes unless  alright you can tell cmdr data  he has my permission to contact his friend  and conduct her to a safer location  number one you know where we are now  sir  sarjenka this is data please respond  unable to complete transmission  reason for failure  atmospheric activity interfering with rf signal  were modifying probes to become resonators  torpedo casings will protect them for burrowing beneath the surface  how will these resonators destroy the crystals  by emitting harmonic vibrations to shatter the lattices  we will monitor and adjust the frequency of the resonators  sounds like a plan lets get started   captain  tea earl grey hot  captain permission to beam down to drema iv  what  ive been unable to contact sarjenka  data i appreciate your concern  transporting to the surface will make a bad situation worse  sir it is important to determine the reason for  come on data  your orders were to deliver the message   yes  then what is the difference  between sending the message and delivering it   a big one and you know it  we have come this far  in for a penny in for a pound  yes sir  oh hell  go  sir  number one handle the transporter go  where are we now  take a nap you didnt see this  ill just be standing here dozing off  ten minutes if you see anyone but sarjenka  i will signal for immediate beamout   cmdr riker to the bridge  damn  i just woke up sir ill have him out of there smooth as ice  sarjenka  wait im data  data  you came  where have you been  there isnt time to explain you and your family must leave  we already have we ran when the tremors began  why are you here  my father wouldnt let us take anything  but i had to have my transmitter  i knew youd come back  and i didnt want you to find only silence the way i did  i am sorry for that but it is very complicated  does your family know where you are  no  you cannot survive in this  what are we going to do  enterprise two to beam up   you must come with me  where are we going  to the stars  therell be hell to pay   where is cmdr riker  on the bridge   where are you going  to the bridge  and youre taking that   please dont leave me here  quite impossible  sir three minutes to resonator launch   where is he  hell be here  he has brought a child onto my ship and on my bridge  im sure mr data has a good explanation  i do sir  she was frightened and  mr data kindly assume your station  counsellor will you escort her to sickbay  no data im scared dont make me go   no ones going to hurt you  no   well go and get a treat  no  captain she will not be in the way  one minute to launch   itll be alright  no  just leave me alone   i want data  counsellor allow me please  sarjenka no one will harm you these are my friends  mr data take your station and keep her with you  this does concern her  ten seconds  i will require my hand  thank you  firing torpedoes  sensors locked on probes  torpedoes have reached their targets  resonators activated harmonic sequences have begun   what are you doing  trying to quiet your planet  if we succeed there will be no more quakes no more volcanoes  when will the results be known  they should happen very quickly sir  and my parents and brothers  captain sensors indicate a planetwide reduction  in tectonicstress levels  it worked we did it   your parents will be safe now  you did this for me  look sarjenka there is your home  data escort her to sickbay  aye sir  number one you have the bridge   doctor  yes captain  data and the alien are on their way  what would be involved in removing all memory  of her communication with data  and her visit to this ship  assuming that her brain structure is similar to ours  the memories will be stored chemically  on the neurons of the cerebral cortex  theyre also timedependent  i would have to scan for the age of the chemical links  and try to find the relevant neurons  well do your best  you have many kinds of people here  yes   when i am bigger can i be here  i am certain you could   i wish i could come now  i am afraid that is not possible  i know but i can still wish for it  dr pulaski this is sarjenka   hello sarjenka  hello  what is this  thats an elanian singer stone  it sings a different song for each person  what does it sing for you   it does not sing for me  why not  because i am a machine  sarjenka were going to run a few scans to be sure youre alright  data will be right here dont worry  you did a good thing  but are we doing a good thing now  this is to protect her as much as us  by robbing her of memories  to remember you and this ship would complicate her future  she has to be the person she was born to be  and youll remember her  enterprise one to beam up   sit down  no thank you sir  im not qualified enough to sit there  you did a good job im proud of you  thank you sir does it get any easier  no  come  i came to apologize sir  no apologies are necessary  you reminded us that there are obligations that go beyond duty  i appreciate your seeking other options  your decision could have been unilateral  one of my officers one of my friends was troubled i had to help   is sarjenka safely home  yes sir  she will not remember me sir but i will remember her  remembrance and regrets are also a part of friendship  yes sir  and understanding that  has brought you a step closer to understanding humanity
