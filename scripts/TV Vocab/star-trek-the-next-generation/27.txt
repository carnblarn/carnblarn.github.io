                youre worried   with reason  about worf or cmdr riker  both i think it is perhaps best to be ignorant  of certain elements of klingon psyche  above look out  the exercise is over  at ease lieutenant  exit holodeck  you do this every day  no commander  usually my callisthenics are more intense  but those sessions are too personal to be shared  ill bet they are  computer program complete save  coming commander  right behind you  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilisations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  captains log stardate 421936  were bound for morgana quadrant  which has yet to be visited by a manned federation vessel  we are using the time to detail the charts of this region  there it is again sir  an area of blackness  it appears disappears then reappears  no predictable pattern  on screen  there it is  i cant see anything  magnify section 285  there it is sir its like a hole in space  were acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon but this  this appears quite different  what do your sensors indicate   nothing sir  nothing  mr data you must mean its empty of matter  theres always some energy at work  sensors show this to be the absence of everything  a void without matter or energy  yet this hole has a form height width  perhaps perhaps not sir  thats hardly a scientific observation  captain the most elementary and valuable statement in science  the beginning of wisdom is i do not know  i do not know what that is sir  captain if this were any ordinary kind of hole in space  wouldnt we see whats behind it  counsellor  i know what youre asking but i feel nothing from it  data is there any record anywhere of any occurrence similar to this  accessing  negative sir  no record of any federation vessel encountering anything like this  indeed i believe we have time to take a closer look number one  concur  ensign slow down to half impulse power  adjust coordinates to intercept whatever this is  scanning and recording as we go  aye sir adjusting course to intercept in 12 minutes  lets launch a probe into it  worf prepare a scanner probe  this is close enough hold this position  aye sir holding this position  fire probe when ready mr worf  all probe systems are functioning perfectly sir   its gone  data what happened  unknown sir  recommend we go to yellow alert  why  explain  sorry sir its  mr worf  this starship operates best when my officers say whats on their minds  my thoughts were of an old klingon legend of  a gigantic black space creature  which was said to devour entire vessels   devour vessels  sorry commander  i agree these are thoughts hardly worthy  of a trained and practical security officer  mr worf will you launch another probe  a class1 with full sensor array  launching sir  happened even more quickly   recommend photon torpedo  negative  captain ive been able to plot the outer boundaries  i could move in closer  make it so mr crusher thrusters only  mr data   still no readings of any kind sir  number one  im going with worf on this one lets be careful  alright thats enough ensign hold these coordinates  aye sir   whats happened  data  whatever it is sir we seem to be inside it   it enveloped us it moved  all stations report  no response captain  captains log supplemental  while exploring a strange void in space without any matter or energy  we have apparently moved past its boundary and entered it  after a brief disruption  communications have returned to normal  all stations have reported appears to be no immediate threat  lets hold this position its worth studying  incredible its like looking into infinity  remember the ancient history course at starfleet academy  about when men believed the earth was flat  and the sun revolved around it  and that a ship could fall off the edge of the world  beyond this place there be dragons  its even said that crews threatened to hang their captain  if he refused to turn back  im sure no one here has that in mind sir   how comforting number one  captain  we have no communications outside of the void  complete scans data lets stay no longer than we must  doctor have you been briefed on whats happened  i heard but i dont understand it  wish i could say i did increase magnification by ten  by 100  isnt this impossible sir im not a bridge officer but  increase by 1000 mr data  by 10000  it does know how to do these things doesnt it  cmdr data knows precisely what hes doing  forgive me mr data  im not accustomed to working with nonliving devices that  forgive me again your service record says that you are alive  i must accept that  engineering   are all systems functioning  yes captain  wherever we are is having no effect on engineering  thank you data  difficult to judge with no information  speculate  this void has a total lack of dimension  therefore by all standards it does not exist  yet being within it denies that conclusion  might we have moved into another dimension  could a lack of dimension be another dimension in itself  thats an interesting question  for a later discussion  we should get on with our mission  starfleet can send a science vessel to investigate further   move us back out  aye sir  reverse direction  set course for cornelian star system impulse power  aye sir reversing direction course laid in  engage   your engines have engaged  aye sir  lt la forge id like you to monitor our velocity closely  is everything alright  are the engines operating normally  yes sir everything looks fine here   were increasing to warp two  aye sir  we should be seeing stars by now  data how far have we come  inertial guidance shows  ensign  confirmed sir exactly what my readings say  engineering transfer to bridge  whats happening sir we should be clear  we should be were on a reverse course   full stop helm  full stop sir  this says were past the point at which we entered the void  but we are still in it sir  captain  if we dropped a stationary beacon  we would have a fixed point of reference  to confirm speed and distance  make it so lock onto it keep it dead astern   the beacon is in place  dead ahead impulse power  the beacon is falling astern  engineering report  all systems functioning normally   prepare to increase to warp two  aye sir  captain were receiving a signal from dead ahead  maybe youve found the door out of this   closing on the new signal sir  identify  captain it is the stationary beacon we just released  weve come full circle sir  we couldnt have sir ive shown us moving steadily away from it  full stop hold this position again  captain sensors indicate a disturbance in sector 108  possibly a vessel  perhaps some answers at last on screen  the ship is equipped with a cloaking device  romulan   its closing  shields up red alert   ill be at my duty station  viewer locked onto coordinates  arm photon torpedoes mr worf  hold for my orders   there  its uncloaking  direct hit sir our shields are weakening  warn them well return fire  transmitting theyve armed another full spread sir  fire torpedoes  oh that was too easy  our sensors show no debris from the romulan vessel  impossible  another vessel approaching sector 091 mark 26  on screen  magnify  its a federation ship ncc 1305e  its the yamato our sister ship  the yamatos nowhere near here  open a hailing frequency data  uss enterprise to uss yamato  respond please  uss enterprise calling uss yamato  respond please on this frequency   no response captain  make a full scan  lifesupport system engineering and propulsion appear functional   but there are no life signs  can it be a false reading  as we know nothing of these circumstances it is conceivable  you look doubtful sir  im not anything number one  im just a man looking for answers  like the rat said keep the cheese  i just want out of the trap  request permission to board the yamato with an away team  something on board might explain what happened   granted minimal complement  worf youre with me  captains log supplemental  we remain like a fly in amber trapped in the void  we have encountered what appears to be the uss yamato  all systems show functioning yet it seems devoid of life  cmdr riker is leading an away team  hopefully the answer lies over there   have you got a lock on that ship  aye sir   can you put us on the bridge  anywhere  i know the yamato recommend the aft station of the bridge  when in doubt surprise them   them whos them  whoever may be there   our sensors show no life forms  still the tactic is sound   agreed aft station  aye sir  phasers on stun  energise  this isnt the bridge worf  halt dont fire  i heard you screaming i was coming to help  you heard me i heard you  transporter chief where do you show us here  we show  captain do you read me  were having difficulty with our communications  number one come in  transporter room weve lost contact with the away team beam them back  ive lost the lock on them  nothing on my communicator sir  computer on  lets find a turbo lift to the bridge  transporter room have you established a lock  emergency power engaged   initiate full check all systems  engineering section  what is our situation  engineering  request permission to leave the bridge  granted  this isnt a federation ship these walls arent tritanium  its material beyond our technology  lets get to the bridge there must be an answer somewhere  this bridge should be four decks above us whats going on here  thats not where we came from  wait a minute  two bridges  if we go through there where will we be  on the bridge  but we are on the bridge  its up to you sir  lets see what happens  is it the same bridge  or did we step from one bridge onto another bridge  weve regained communication sir   i have a star fix  on screen  its an opening sir   navigation is possible  should i set a course  transporter room any fix on the away team  negative captain  damn  commander  how did you   where did you come from  whats going on  a ship has one bridge one bridge  one riker one bridge  lieutenant  this is impossible impossible  pull yourself together  at ease lieutenant at ease  captain the star fix is fading  data lock on to the yamato with a tractor beam   i cannot make the lock  the star fix is almost gone  let it go   but sir we can get out  let it go  bridge i have contact with the away team   beam them back immediately  captain   come in enterprise  hold position away team  were bringing you home   transporter room hurry  its almost gone   what is going on  are you alright  lets put this technology to work and get the hell outta here  a ship that was almost the yamato in a hole in space with no crew  what is the purpose  plus an attack by a nonexistent romulan vessel  it poses an interesting question was our away team actually there   if not where were we  commander  i have reestablished the star fix  great set course velocity warp two   course and speed set  engage   i have lost contact sir  what  the star fix is gone  captain it is not in the same sector  but another opening has appeared  alright set a course for those stars warp six   yes sir warp six  i have lost the signal sir   whats going on  all stop  captain  yes mr data i can see it  this game is wearing very thin  lets just hold this position  counsellor you said you sensed no intelligence in all of this  you havent changed in that belief  im not certain now captain i do sense something unusual  perhaps a different level of consciousness  perhaps an intelligence so vast it eluded me   rats in a maze  exactly  explain  everything reminds me of a laboratory experiment  as if something was testing our responses to stimuli  are you suggesting that were in some kind of laboratory  yes  the opening seems closer captain   ive had enough of this  agreed captain hold position  good dont satisfy its curiosity  captain look  why are you so alarmed ive tried to look just like you  captain sensors show nothing out there absolutely nothing  sure is a damn ugly nothing  i am capt jeanluc picard of the uss enterprise  representing a federation of planets in this part of the galaxy  can you identify whoever or whatever you are  nagilum  speaks right up for something that isnt there data  we still have no idea what you represent  data  nagilum  you are of different construction than the others interesting  what are you your construction also differs  my construction  perhaps referring to your gender doctor  yes well there are minor differences  im what we call a female  i understand the masculine and the feminine  it is the way we propagate our species  please demonstrate how this is accomplished  not likely  whatever you are your actions are not welcome  let me put up the shields sir  sensors still show nothing out there  your life form surprises me more and more  is it true you also have only a limited existence  answer  what do you want i dont understand the question  you exist and then you cease to exist  your minds call it death  how interesting  hes gone  we cannot allow you to do that we will fight you  to understand death  i must amass information on every aspect of it  every kind of dying  the experiment shouldnt take more than a third of your crew  maybe half  captains log stardate 42194 7  it is obvious that whatever we have met  sees no value in our life form  how do we fight something that both is and is not there  i know this much we are unimportant to it  in a battle for survival   would be appalling  but within acceptable limits  this is not a battle worf  no a laboratory experiment would be the closest comparison  any reason not to believe nagilum  no  evidence indicates it is willing and able to do as it proposes  agreed under the circumstances there is only one decision  i will not stand by while half my crew is slaughtered  sir i cannot see anything you can do to prevent it   yes there is  what  destroy the enterprise  isnt that like curing the disease by killing the patient  better than standing around helplessly  why do i get the feeling this was not the time to join this ship  recognise picard jeanluc  recognise riker william t  initiate autodestruct sequence   does riker william t concur  i do  initiate autodestruct sequence  desired time interval  stand by  interesting question how long to prepare to die  what would be the least painful for our crew  move to it quickly or allow them time to prepare thoroughly  well 20 minutes nice round figure  initiate autodestruct  interval 20 minutes    come  our destroying ourselves wont change its mind  i would feel that  you didnt mention you were that certain  i was wrong not to tell you and your decision may also be wrong  yes come in please   i have a question sir  yes data what is it  what is death  is that all  well data youre asking probably the most difficult of all questions  some see it as a changing into an indestructible form  forever unchanging  they believe that the purpose of the entire universe  is to then maintain that form  in an earthlike garden which will give delight through all eternity  on the other hand there are those who hold to the idea  of our blinking into nothingness  with all our experiences hopes and dreams merely a delusion  which do you believe sir  considering the marvellous complexity of the universe  its clockwork perfection its balances of this against that  matter energy gravitation time dimension  i believe that our existence  must be more than either of these philosophies  that what we are  goes beyond euclidian or other practical measuring systems  and that our existence is part of a reality  beyond what we understand now as reality  we should not let ourselves die jeanluc  i agree with her jeanluc  if only half of us live  id rather take my chances on being one that does  yes it is wrong of you to force us  it is wrong  yes this is very wrong  neither of you should be reacting in this way  computer locate cmdr data for me  cmdr data is on the bridge  its not going to work nagilum  captain we are clear we are out of the void  its gone captain we can abort the autodestruct  hold number one   but captain  hold  one minute to autodestruct  we are out of the void you may stop autodestruct  mr crusher warp six any heading now    40 seconds to autodestruct  captain  it could all be part of the illusion  cmdr data report   we are at warp six on course  30 seconds to autodestruct   counsellor troi  it has gone   i no longer feel its presence  20 seconds to autodestruct  ten seconds to autodestruct  captain  abort autodestruct sequence   riker william t do you concur  yes i do concur wholeheartedly  autodestruct cancelled  a simple yes would have sufficed  i didnt want there to be any chance of a misunderstanding  of course  you have the bridge  he sure held that bluff to the last second didnt he sir  was he bluffing  well nagilum i hope you got what you needed  you have provided me with much more than i needed  why did you release us you could have seen the way we face death  it wasnt necessary i learned all i needed to know  would you like me to share some conclusions  im not interested  of course you are youre too inquisitive for that  you seem to find no tranquillity in anything  you struggle against the inevitable  you thrive on conflict  youre selfish yet you value loyalty  you are rash quick to judge slow to change  its amazing youve survived  be that as it may as species we have no common ground  youre too aggressive  too hostile too militant  during this period you too have been evaluated  it would seem we have at least one thing in common  curiosity  the point is well taken captain  perhaps that is a trait we share  and perhaps we shall meet again  but next time it will be out here among the stars  ensign put us back on course warp three  yes sir warp three  and ensign if you encounter any holes steer clear
