protocol  they demand a precise greeting in this case from capt picard  their language is most unusual  the slightest mispronunciation is regarded as an insult  unless its followed by  the double bars indicate an elongated s sound  and the inverted  means to hold the z  unless  unless its followed by three wavy lines  in which case the z becomes a b  exactly   what a language  but you spell knife with a k  i spell knife with an n but then i never could spell  well this is an insect mind sir  my mind is barely working   take a break  no i want to go over this again  you could be overpreparing

sir  we are in a holodeckcreated building of 1941  the computer refuses to accept voice commands  the controls for the environment are therefore not accessible  i could use some light  good day mr hill my name is cyrus redblock  i hope you dont mind us dropping in  i see i have no choice  life is an endless stream of choices  unfortunately you have chosen to make my life more difficult  i dont suppose youd be foolish enough to hide it here  i dont suppose so  still im sure you wont mind if we take a look around  i wish youd quit asking youll do it anyway its a waste of time  good manners madam are never a waste of time  civility gentlemen always civility   get that stiff out of here  hes not dead  from his pallor he soon will be  you want i should throw him in the garbage boss  the room next door will be good enough for now  dont touch him  which one struck you  it was hill  for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction  a newtonian truism which you have obviously neglected  dix you in there  i saw your light figured you were working late guess i was right  nice company youre keeping dix  forget to take the trash out this morning  im a tolerant man but i do not tolerate disrespect  your devotion to etiquette is highly admirable sir  however your methods leave much to be desired   what have we here  he looks like a ghost  yeah where do you suppose hes from  where were you hatched anyway  i was created on a planet  south america  ive been all over the world and ive never seen anything like you  hes not from this world  none of us are  were from a world

right dix thats pretty weak stuff  i wouldnt even buy that guff  i am not dixon hill  i just look like dixon hill  he speaks the truth sir  from your point of view he is only a facsimile  a knockoff a cheap imitation  thank you mr data  sorry sir that did not come out quite the way i intended  very very good what wonderful fiction  quite entertaining  i admire your skill at trying to obfuscate our sense of reality  it is you who are not real  you are imaginary characters derived from a work of fiction  fellas these guys are too smart to fall for that kind of story  im afraid you are not real either lieutenant  i dont want to hear any more youre making me crazy  let me shoot them mr redblock let me kill them  one by one  what an interesting situation  perhaps we should test this theory by killing one of them  youve already done that this man is dying its all so senseless  hardly senseless killing is immoral  but killing for a purpose can be quite often ingenious  well said mr redblock  what is our purpose  we are on a quest for knowledge   we want the item  we dont have it   shall i kill him  no  kill the woman  i have the item  at last  i knew it god man what a character you are  waiting until the last moment testing my resolve  alright where is it  ill explain  but first tell leech to back off  put the gun down  but i so much want to kill her  maybe later it wont harm us to listen to mr hill  dont make any deals with that slime dix  alright lets begin  make your thoughts fruitful and your words eloquent  i dont have to tell you your lady friends life depends upon it  there is a price  by god i knew you were a man of my stripe alright what is it  mr whalens life you must help us to save him  we cant delay much longer  well have to tell them something open hailing

let ensign crusher explain   the biconverter interface  forget explanations can you do it  i dont know if i should sir  if this isnt done correctly the program could abort  and everyone inside could vanish  do you need more time to study it  whether we do it now or later the risk is the same  do it  if we can find a way of getting him to sickbay by fixing our computer  computer i dont know that word  an electronic or mechanical apparatus capable of carrying out  repetitious or complex mathematical operations at high speed  computers are used to control process perform or store  enough let me kill him hes really beginning to irritate me  captain the exit  thats it thats the way into our world  remarkable is this a twoway passage  can one enter your world  and return to this one simply by stepping through  yes  allow us to help mr whalen and we will return with the item  you really are a scamp arent you  do you think id stay here  if you were going to go through yourself that is not possible  one look at you sir is proof that anything is possible  step aside mr hill  id shoot you myself  but i dont want to deprive my assistant of his greatest pleasure  after were gone kill them all make sure the bodies are never found  youre insane you think you can kill a cop and get away with it  why not ive done it before  come on  au revoir and bonne chance mon ami  our destiny awaits
