                captains log stardate 413864  were in pursuit of a starship of ferengi design  our mission is to recover a t9 energy converter  which the ferengi stole from an unmanned post on gamma tauri iv  a theft which scanners recorded providing us with the opportunity  to make close contact with a ferengi vessel  if we succeed it will be starfleets first look at a life form  which discounting rumor we know almost nothing about  there she is  enlarge  what is their course  theyre angling through that solar system  identify  listed as delphi ardu sir  stay with them la forge  power surge from their last maneuver  they are dropping to subwarp speed  reduce to impulse power  fluctuations in energy readings from it captain  possibility a malfunction in their engines   breaks my heart  in visual range captain  fully enlarge  hello stranger   very impressive design  anything on that design data  nothing specific sir  ferengi technology is estimated to be equal to our own  but that does not mean identical however  correct we will be advanced in some areas they in others  another power surge sir  they are firing on us   damage report  shields holding  mostly electromagnetic fusion generator down by 30 percent   our impulse engines are surging  theyre firing again  deflectorshield power weakening  phasers ready photon torpedoes ready  do we return their fire sir  negative theyre just responding to our close pursuit  fall back a bit but stay with them  theyre slowing  they may be turning to fight  open hailing why are we gaining on them dont anticipate  im not sir  something is dragging us forward  i read that too lt yar what do your sensors show  not certain sir im getting very confusing readings  captain this shouldnt be our power systems are failing  deflector shield failing phasers going inoperative  something is completely immobilizing us  immobilized by the damn ferengi  we need more information what the hell are they using  obviously we underestimated their technology  considerably  the ferengi have us right where they want us in their sights  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  are you searching all frequencies any message  negative sir  weapons report  phasers and torpedoes are armed  but i show insufficient power to fire them  engineering give me status on power recovery  engineering come in  why arent they answering  la forge get a report from engineering  aye sir  its impossible they could be draining all power from all systems   counselor  im sensing nothing from them sir  it could mean they can shield their thoughts and emotions from others  so its our move  they may know as little about us as we do about them  they know theyve got us in deep trouble  if so then what do they do with that knowledge  data do you have any information on this on any file  none only hearsay and thirdhand reports most of which conflict  which reports do not conflict  that the ferengi are the best description may be traders  what kind of traders  scholars of earth history liken the ferengi  to the oceangoing yankee traders of 18th and 19thcentury america  from the history of my forebears yankee traders  who search the galaxy for mercantile and territorial opportunity  are scholars saying that the ferengi may be like us  hardly sir the analogy refers to the worst quality of capitalists  the ferengi conduct their affairs of commerce  on the ancient principle caveat emptor  let the buyer beware  yankee traders i like that  well i doubt they wear red white and blue or look like uncle sam  engineering join la forge in engineering number one  aye sir  without warp capacity were just a floating target  uncle who  what have primary colors got to do with it  i understand the allusion  colors representing countries at a time when they competed  red white and blue for the united states  whereas the french more properly used the same colors  in the order blue white and red  the germans red black and gold   the italians green white and red  thats enough data   it was you who  we were discussing the ferengi  i wish i had a clue what they will do next  given what is happening to our ship  their weapons could be vastly superior to ours  yes data that is a natural assumption  engineering   bottom line  not good sir  their force field compensates almost as fast as we can increase power  theres a 0372 millisecond delay between the use of our power  and the counter force of the ferengi  see we push and they push back with equal force sir  whats our delay between slowreverse impulse and top warp speed  thats 0300 milliseconds theres  i see where youre going  we shift down then kick hard into warp nine come back fighting   can we do it  ask me after its done sir  i want a slow reverse into dropoff over five minutes  well show em sir   give me everything youve got  ayeaye sir  in an abrupt power surge to high warp speed  we may be able to break loose from that ferengi force field  i wish i knew what they were thinking  theyre wondering what well do next  i say fight theres no shame in falling before a superior enemy  and no shame in a strategic retreat either  all systems ready communication is restored to engineering  excellent la forge  now lets throw them off guard  lt yar open hailing frequencies  hailing frequencies open sir  at least we wont begin with weakness  attention ferengi starship  this is captain jeanluc picard of the uss enterprise  in the name of the federation  i demand that you return the t9 energy converter  you removed from gamma tauri iv  send that in all language forms  all language forms sir  sometimes the best way to fight is not to be there  yes sir  he will triumph who knows when to fight and when not to fight  im glad the academy still teaches the strategies of sun tzu  this delay had better prove out   lets blast full power into warp nine ready  on your command captain  on the count of three stand by on phasers  one set warp to nine  two divert shield power to main engines  three  merde  shields up  captain i think you had better see this  whats wrong  someone is reading every file in the enterprise memory banks   they can do that  and more perhaps  captain if i may recommend  with our attention on the ferengi vessel we have ignored the planet  data consult the charts on this planet see what weve got on it  conference evaluation  so its time for difficult decisions opinions please  i say put all power into a combined phaser and torpedo salvo  destroy their ability to sustain this force field  yes hit them hard and hit them fast  impractical and provocative  even assuming we have power to sustain such a tactic  but firing on us is an act of war  the facts are the ferengis did fire on us but we were chasing them  since then all theyve done  is search our computers to learn what we are   your point  lets talk to them  its been tried no response  but did we tell them anything they wanted to hear  other opinions thank you for your advice  will i havent had your assessment  i believe weve covered every available option captain  are there other options you want to analyze  the only one left is the one that needs no conversation   the one we must avoid  sir  the one that leads to total annihilation   open hailing frequencies  open sir  attention ferengi starship this is captain picard  it is obvious that we are in a situation which needs resolving  we are willing to do whatever is required  whatever is necessary  i would like  i would request that you present your terms to us  captains log stardate 413865  it is with a heavy heart that i have offered to meet any reasonable terms  demanded by the ferengi  i fear for my people and vessel  in the event that the unknown ferengi ask the unreasonable  how can i oppose even unreasonable demands  its moving sir  we ask to surrender now they fire on us  ready torpedoes we have enough power for a few  ready but hold on ready   open hailing frequencies  hailing frequencies open sir  ferengi vessel we await your response  suggest first strike sir  our shields now only have  if their sensors can read us  they will wait until we are most vulnerable   i agree they have not responded  wait a bit more   patience  the quicker we can come to terms the better ncc 17o 1d  who is speaking  i am tarr daimon of the ferengi  you wish to discuss surrender capt picard  what i said daimon tarr is  unconditional surrender i warn you is totally unacceptable  we will die to the last one of us before such dishonor  hailing frequencies closed  something has seized their ship too theyre in the same predicament  launch a sensor probe  set it to search for whatever it is that is holding both ships  go back to hailing frequency fast  and i regret daimon tarr  that i can no longer negotiate unless it is conducted visually  your complete message not received  but visual communication is against our custom  it is against starfleet orders to accept a surrender otherwise  do you withdraw your surrender  you give us no choice enterprise may we have a visual on you as well  agreed daimon tarr you should be able to view us now  are we on your screen  yes the ugliness of the human was not an exaggeration  i do not know how you have paralyzed our vessel  i concede your enterprise is superior  we will return your t9 we offer the lives of our second officers  as required by the ferengi code  fortunately starfleet has no such rules for its second officers  is this to your satisfaction picard  your offer may be inadequate but i will discuss it with my staff  stand by for further communication  matthew pola you know this area is off limits come on  boys will be boys   have you launched the probe  aye well get the readings soon  if were not holding the ferengi and theyre not holding us who is  the probe will give us some answers  data you were going to show us something  as requested library computer information on this planet  it has been charted only from longrange scans  it is classm but shows no life forms sentient or otherwise  however you may find this of interest  resolving it into our language  the centre of a huge space federation  a population of trillions  trillions ive never heard the word tkon before  understandable it has been extinct for 600000 of our  of our years  these planets were once outposts of that empire   data what are you doing  apologies captain  i seem to have reached an odd  functional impasse  i am stuck  get unstuck and continue the briefing  that is what i am trying to do sir but the solution eludes me  my hero  continue commander  intriguing  it des  it describes the empire as being highly advanced and powerful  and capable of actually moving stars  stars whose planets are their defense system  correct sir outposts the planet below was possibly one of them  excuse the interruption but this is worth it  were receiving a signal from the probe  well take it here  incredible  theres our mysterious something it is a force field of some kind  reaching up from the planet surface amazing power  what does the legend say about the end of the tkon empire   their sun went supernova  could this planet have escaped  it may have been the most distant outpost  but it shows no lifeform readings  lets take a look stand by with an away team  and if the ferengi realize the fields from the planet  thats a complication we should ask them to join us  team up with the ferengi  weve been ordered to learn about them do you know a better way  captains log supplemental  in orbit of a planet whose unexplained force field  has seized us with a power almost beyond imagination  any solution to this will almost certainly involve  cooperation from the ferengi  ships power drain is critical  i must shut down shields to maintain life support  understood   open hailing frequencies  hailing frequencies open sir  ferengi vessel from enterprise come in  your alien images again shock us  about the surrender the facts are different  our own probe has shown us your trickery human   we withdraw our surrender  agreed  perhaps you would agree to a more productive relationship  id prefer a more profitable one human   yankee trader  explain what means yankee traders  he heard that  he recognizes your interest in profit or is that incorrect  we seek only what is equitable  what do you seek why did you attack us  we did not attack we gave chase to recover a federation energy device  which is ours your federation placed it on one of our planets  no gamma tauri iv is recognized by all civilized  the ferengi are not uncivilized are you suggesting otherwise  all im saying is that you removed something  which did not belong to you  are you now calling us thieves  on the contrary i have no wish to discuss property or territory  while our mutual problem remains  like it or not we are both trapped  by this energydraining force field from the planet  on that matter there can be no argument  i would like to propose a swap   and what is a swap  its a trade an exchange  yes trade human what do you offer  we will tell you what we know about the planet  in trade you give us your information  how do we know you will not withhold information   we must trust each other tarr  amusing human trust each other  i propose that we test this relationship  by cooperating in a joint exploration of the planets surface  and what profit is in this  the profit daimon tarr of saving all our lives  we will agree no doubt foolishly  but any trickery on your part will meet with no mercy  agreed if you care to join us our transporter device  we have a device of our own  we will beam a science team of three to coordinates you can propose  we will transmit the information shortly   enterprise out  hailing frequencies off  i would log that agreement as promising at least  i wonder captain  i dont usually distrust on sight but this is an exception  especially in view of the fact that his transmission was distorted  i sensed the same thing captain hes hiding something  with the power drain we cant delay  id like additional help can you spare worf  take him and be careful number one  with the power drain communication may be hard  understood anything else  the force field means we cannot beam back   you had to ask  understood energize  anybody   what are you doing up there  most intriguing sir  i assume inaccurately transmitted coordinates  due to the force field around the ship sir  are we alone sir  unfortunately lets find the others  what do you make of these  crystalline mostly inert nothing to write home about   excuse me  slang sir  i did use it correctly did i not  they have to be around here somewhere   whats that  what   are you conscious  do i look conscious   what are you doing  resting sir  my foots stuck up there  i materialized upside down above the planets surface  tricorders useless communications gone too   fortunately you did not break  data whos that  who are you  captains log supplemental  it is six hours since our away team beamed down to the planet  on the enterprise our condition is rapidly worsening  ordinarily with reserve power  we could maintain life support for several months  but the force holding us has closed down all engines  and is draining our reserve power too  its getting colder sir how far down is it likely to go  a lot even in orbital space itll get below minus 200 degrees  you wont have to worry much past minus 70 or so  feels like that now good thank you  if he moves kill him  letek we have broken our agreement with their captain  we will accuse the humans of preparing to ambush us  it will be our word against theirs  and who is more trustworthy mordoc  it looks like gold   tastes like gold  it is gold  accursed planet  its nothing to what our captain will do for breaking our agreement  what part of the agreement you appeared and attacked us  are you one of their assassins  im cmdr william riker first officer of the uss enterprise  you have a lot to learn  i got this one  careful they are much stronger than  pygmy cretins   kill them hideous monsters  no  good youve heard of phasers  now over there   is this a female  a human female letek  yes it is true  you work with your females arm them  and force them to wear clothing  sickening  ive diverted the reserve power to the family decks  theyll last longest  is there anything else we can do doctor  wheres wesley  hes in our quarters   i considered giving him a sedative  you shouldnt  i know but hes my son i love him  he has the right to meet death awake  is that a male perspective  rubbish  hold it right there  stop   phasers on stun  already set  whats going on  what is this  we can deduce that these crystalline tree shapes  are actually energy collectors  on the same principle as that which is draining energy from our ships  the ferengi whips were working earlier  so something new has happened  im beginning to understand what my eyes are showing me  its patterns of force everywhere  this entire planet has been turned into a power accumulator  these are the point of this place  i can see power emanating  commander  be you barbarians speak  who meets the challenge  who will it be  him  you have awakened portal 63 do you petition to enter the empire   who asks the question  a guardian of the tkon empire  biped excellent  why would we petition to enter an empire that no longer exists  why do you attempt this deception the empire is for ever  your empire fell prey to a supernova  we are for ever  data please repeat the file  it is a matter of record  in the age of makto the central star of the tkon empire destabilized  there has never been an age of makto  in fact many ages have come and passed since makto   it is the age of bastu  im afraid not  according to the tkon use of the galactic motionary startime charts  after bastu came cimi xora makto  enough absurdities  you must have been asleep for hundreds of thousands of our years  deception is the way of the human  we ferengi will gladly make a petition  we invite your petition  speak  we wish to offer our services  to serve the tkon empire at no profit  return control of our starship to us  and we will happily destroy the human criminals  and their vessel which attacked us without provocation  they came to loot your empire  but we intercepted them  you are accused of deceit and treachery  do you give yourself up for judgment  yes if you believe these accusations then act on them  and there is even more  we can prove that the humans are destroyers of legal commerce  and that they withhold vital technology from backward worlds  and necessary defensive weapons too  we ferengi now challenge this human madness  i admit we withheld modern technologies from some worlds  you see they are demented their values are insane  they have destroyed business opportunities  proof of their barbarism  they adorn themselves with gold a despicable use of a valuable metal  and they shamelessly clothe their females  inviting others to unclothe them the very depth of perversion  paws off ferengi  no female human or ferengi can order mordoc around  submit   just try it shorty  at ease lieutenant  and we still have more faults  starfleet has permitted several civilizations to fall  we have allowed the strong to overcome the weak  they admit their crimes hear them  they admit the evil that they do   barbarian  yes you show wisdom  barbarians all but this one first  in the fashion the empire has always challenged savages   no for battle come to me  no thats an order  you have a single chance for life one only  what is the answer to my challenge  i offer a thought  he will triumph who knows when to fight and when not to fight  you are being tested riker what is the answer  how do you know my name  you are facing fate with composure  but what is the answer to my challenge  fear is the true enemy the only enemy  unlike these little ones who close their minds  your mind holds interesting thoughts  know your enemy and know yourself and you will always be victorious  why that thought and who is this sun tzu you revere  an old chinese philosopher from ancient earth history  tell me more of this wisdom so much like our own  gladly but first our starship can you release it  it is released all power is restored  not a moment too soon jean  i mean captain  i had my doubts as your ships battled each other  in acts of belligerence  normally i would destroy all of you and your ships   but something confused me  which was  first you wanted to destroy each other  then you agreed to assist each other  what of our vessel we knew the same answer  the truth is i gave those words to this human  what of them shall i destroy them  then they would learn nothing  a most interesting conclusion  but what if they never learn riker  is this a test also  in life one is always tested  i see them much as we were several hundred years ago  but possessing the technology they now have they are dangerous  untrue we seek friendship with you  but we can hardly hate what we once were they may grow and learn  and learn ways to destroy you  our values require us to face that possibility  what of you with your empire gone  the universe exists to me to create life  i shall sleep until needed again  compliments lieutenant lt worf   youve done well  something to write home about  something to write home about thats very human  the t9 has been beamed aboard securely  the ferengi complained but one final roar from portal convinced them   i commend your performance  one final request sir  permission to beam a box of datas chinese finger puzzles  over to the ferengi  a thank you for all they tried to do  make it so  set course la forge
