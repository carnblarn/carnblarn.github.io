                hot chocolate please  we dont ordinarily say please to food dispensers here  since its listed as intelligent circuitry why not  working with artificial intelligence can be dehumanizing  so why not combat that tendency with a little simple courtesy   thanks  for someone just aboard  you arent shy with your opinions   have i been talking too much  no  i do tend to have a motor mouth especially when im excited   this assignment is so exciting  lieutenant  everyone in class wants the enterprise  it would have been fine to spend time on reiner vi  doing phase work with antimatter   thats my specialty  i know  thats why you got this assignment  i did it again its just that  i know youre excited look sonya  i dont think you want to be around control stations with hot chocolate  im sorry i shouldnt have this in engineering i forgot i had it  ill go and finish it over here  lt la forge this will not happen again  no im sorry captain  actually its my fault sir   indeed  i wasnt looking   its all over you  yes ensign it is   at least let me sir  ensign  ensign sonya gomez  a recent academy graduate sir she transferred at starbase 173  is that so well ensign sonya gomez  it will be simpler if i change my uniform  captain i must accept full responsibility for this  yes chief engineer i think i understand  i just want to say sir that i am very excited about this assignment  and i promise to serve you and my ship your ship  this ship to the best of my ability  yes ensign im sure that you will carry on  my dont they say first impressions are the most important  ill give you this its a meeting the captain wont soon forget  deck nine officers quarters   crewman what is going on  welcome picard to shuttlecraft 6  q  havent we been careless a cleaning service im happy to provide  you agreed not to trouble my ship again  i always keep my word sir look we are nowhere near your vessel  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  i read your thesis i wouldnt have wanted you if you werent the best   where are we going  tenforward  were going to forget about work sit talk relax look at the stars   you need to learn to slow down  no i cant do that  youre awfully young to be so driven  yes i am i had to be the best because only the best get to be here  geordi lieutenant  its ok go on  whatever is out here well be the first humans to see it  i want to be a part of that i want to understand it  sonya relax youre here  youve made it but you wont last long banging into walls   itll be there for you believe me  ok  i promise i wont let anything exciting go by without telling you  ok  bridge this is tenforward  guinan youve never called the bridge before   is everything alright  how do you mean  is anything unusual happening  nothing out of the ordinary why do you ask  im not sure its just a feeling  ive had it before its probably nothing  forget that i called tenforward out  the locator beam wont help theyll never look this far away  enterprise this is picard  stop this foolishness q return me  you should change your attitude petulance ill becomes you  we have business picard  keeping me prisoner will not compel me to discuss anything  it will in time  i appreciate your advice lieutenant ill take it to heart  guinan   can i get you something  were fine  is everything alright  i dont know  ill check out engineering  ill go with you   where is the captain  in his quarters  captain this is counsellor troi   computer locate capt picard  the captain is not aboard  commander there is a shuttle missing from bay two   all stop  answering all stop sir  i have hailed the shuttle on all frequencies no response  sensors indicate no shuttle or other ships in this sector  lets assume the captain is aboard that shuttle  how could he leave without us knowing impossible  take it easy wes well find him begin a search worf  set sensors on maximum scan  data use our present location as a centre  plot a search pattern from these coordinates  to cover the most area in the least time   search pattern input sir  engage mr crusher  first officers log stardate 427613  we have not determined why or how capt picard left the enterprise  we are not sure he is in the missing shuttle  although that is our assumption  for the last six hours we have searched without success  we have covered the area in a spherical pattern  which a ship without warp drive could cross in the given time  widen the area  do we stay out here years  decades i am ageless picard you are not  the enterprise will continue with riker as captain  you are an impossibly stubborn human  return me to my ship  if i do will you agree to give my request a full hearing  youre right picard this is the proper venue for our discussion  commander my status board indicates that the shuttle is back   computer locate capt picard  capt picard is in tenforward  i knew it was you  you  picard if you had any sense you would get her off your ship  if you like id be more than pleased to expedite her departure   you know him  we have had some dealings  those dealings were two centuries ago  this creature is not what she appears to be shes an imp  where she goes trouble always follows  you speak of yourself not guinan  guinan is that your name now  guinan is not the issue you are  we agreed you would stop meddling with us   and so i have  state your business out with it  i agree captain enough about this creature  she is diverting us from the purpose of my being here  which is  the redoubtable cmdr riker  and microbrain growl for me let me know you still care   worf  my purpose is to join you   as what  a member of crew willing and able  ready to serve this ship is already home for the indigent  the unwanted the unworthy why not for a homeless entity  homeless the other members of the q continuum kicked you out  not all the q are alike some are almost respectable  ready and willing able to serve  what would you do would you start as an ordinary crewman  what task is too menial for an entity   sir do you mock me  that is the last thing i would do  you are part of our charter  we seek out new life forms and you are one of the most unique  to learn about you is frankly provocative  but youre next of kin to chaos  captain at least hear my argument  after our last encounter i was asked to leave the q continuum  since then ive wandered vaguely bored really  my existence without purpose then i remembered the good times with you  the good times you tried us for the crimes of humanity   you were exonerated  then you asked me   to join the q continuum  you should have taken up my offer  more and more i realize that here is where i want to be  think of the advantages  now i neither expect nor require any special treatment  if necessary although i cant imagine why  i will renounce my powers and become as weak as incompetent as you all  no  no captain in fairness let me try   i deserve at least that much  you kidnapped the captain  i add spice to your lives and you complain  where is your adventurous spirit picard think of the possibilities  simply speaking we dont trust you  maybe not but you do need me you are not prepared for what awaits you  how can we be prepared for that which we do not know  but we are ready to encounter it   really  yes thats why were out here  the arrogance they dont have a clue as to whats out here  but they will learn adapt that is their greatest advantage  they are moving further than they should   by whose calculations  you judge yourselves  against the pitiful adversaries youve met so far  the romulans the klingons  they are nothing compared to whats waiting  picard you are about to move into areas of the galaxy  containing wonders more incredible than you can possibly imagine  and terrors to freeze your soul i offer myself as a guide  only to be rejected out of hand   well do our best without you  what justifies that smugness  not smugness not arrogance  we are resolute we are determined  and your help is not required   well just see how ready you are  q  bridge this is the captain all stop  answering all stop sir  status  according to coordinates we have travelled 7000 light years  and are located near the system j25  travel time to the nearest starbase  at maximum warp in two years seven months three days 18 hours  we would reach starbase 185  why  why to give you a taste of your future  a preview of things to come  con permiso capitn  the hall is rented the orchestra engaged  its now time to see if you can dance  guinan your people have been in this part of the galaxy   yes  what can you tell us  only that if i were you id start back now  captains log stardate 4276 19  despite guinans warning i feel compelled  to investigate this unexplored sector of the galaxy before heading back  captain the sixth planet in the system is classm  it has roads indicating a highly industrialized civilization  but where there should be cities there are great rips in the surface  it is as if all machine elements were scooped off the planets face  it is identical to what happened to the outposts of the neutral zone  captain we are being probed   what is the source of the probe  a ship on an intercept course  on screen  magnify   full scan  go to yellow alert   yellow alert  keep the shields down  we dont want to seem provocative  mr data what can you tell us  the ship is strangely generalized in design  there is no specific bridge no command centre  there is no engineering section  i can identify no living quarters   life signs  there is no indication of life  lt worf what is its alert status  i detect no shields no weapons of any known design   hailing frequencies  open  this is capt jeanluc picard of the uss enterprise   no response  this is capt picard  representing the united federation of planets  guinan  activate your screen and monitor this i may need your input  im here captain  view screen is activated i have the other ship   you know this life form  yes  my people encountered them a century ago they destroyed our cities  scattered my people throughout the galaxy  theyre called the borg  protect yourself captain or they will destroy you   shields up  aye sir  all decks stand by  security come to main engineering  we have an intruder  lieutenant  status  it made a visual survey of the engine core sir then moved in here  interesting isnt it not a he not a she  not like anything youve ever seen an enhanced humanoid  what is it you want  we mean you no harm  do you understand me  understand you youre nothing to him  hes not interested in your life form hes the first of many scouts  here to analyze your technology  he may attempt to gain control of the ship i wouldnt let him  stop  i cannot allow you to interfere with the operation of this ship   mr worf  ensign  use whatever means to neutralize the invader  because her people had contact with the borg i have asked guinan along  you are aware of what occurred in main engineering  yes  what happened between your people and the borg  i wasnt there personally  but from what im told   they swarmed through our system  and when they left there was little or nothing left of my people  if they were that aggressive  why didnt the borg attack when they could  they dont attack individually its not their way  when they decide to come theyll come in force  they dont do anything piecemeal  the initial encounter was solely to gather information  yes  how do we reason with them let them know were no threat  you dont  at least ive never known anyone who did  captain we are being hailed  on screen   this is capt jeanluc picard  your defensive capabilities  are unable to withstand us  if you defend yourselves you will be punished  counsellor  were not dealing with an individual mind  they have no single leader it is the collective minds of them all  that would have definite advantages  one leader can make mistakes its far less likely in a combined whole  picard are you sure you dont want me as a member of your crew  captain the borg have locked on to us with a tractor beam  were on our way  report lieutenant   the beam is draining our shields  well be helpless  warp eight any heading engage  captain the beam is holding us   increase power  shields weakening   shields will be down in 18 seconds  locate tractor beam source  lock on phasers fire   they still have us  shields are down sir  a laser beam is slicing into the saucer section  carving us up like a roast  use whatever force necessary terminate the beam fire when ready  again mr worf  tractor beam released sir force field maintaining our hull integrity   damage report  coming in sir  sections 27 28 and 29 on decks four five and six destroyed  casualties  and are missing  what is the condition of the alien ship  they have sustained damage to 20 percent of their vessel  life support is minimal  conference  i cant get the shields up  divert power from anywhere but life support  it wouldnt help the circuits that control the shields are fused  if you cant reprogram reroute    dead just like that  i know put it out of your head   no i cant i keep seeing them  sonya stop we can grieve later  lets get these shields operative  right of course  guinan how much more can you tell us about these creatures   bits and pieces  anything would help  theyre made up of organic and artificial life  which has been developing for thousands of centuries  the borg is the ultimate user  theyre unlike any threat your federation has ever faced  theyre not interested in political conquest  wealth or power as you know it  theyre interested in your ship its technology  they have identified it as something they can consume  you brought us here exposed us to it  and cost us the lives of our shipmates  oh please  number one   please tell us this is one of your illusions  no this is as real as your socalled life gets  this is lt la forge captain  weve been able to restore power to the shields  very good  captain casualty list coming on screen  cancel well deal with that later  sir if were to have any further dealings with the borg  we should find out all we can about them   visit the ship  i believe thats the only choice   assemble a minimal away team  what  mr worf transporter room three data  i wouldnt go there if i were you  they paid us a visit it seems only fair to return the courtesy  captains log supplemental  we have been attacked by an alien race which guinan calls the borg  we seem to have neutralized their vessel  cmdr riker is leading an away team to try to learn more about them  there are no lifesign readings  ill set you down in the least damaged section of the borg ship  set phasers on stun be ready to increase power if we need it  energize  i wonder why they dont react or why we read no life signs   especially with so many of them  we scanned for individual life  apparently in these slots they become a part of the whole  and no longer read as separate life forms   captain  go ahead number one  our readings were incorrect the borg crew survived  they are in some kind of stasis   explain  there are slots along the wall  compartments with two borg in each  captain i theorize that they are interconnected through these slots   and are working collectively  well access their main computer  commander i believe each slot is designed for a specific borg  here is where the connection is made  like a juggernaut it could begin moving at any moment  the technology behind this biological and artificial interface  is beyond our capabilities there are many advantages  speed being the most obvious  this ship literally thinks what it wants then it happens  fascinating  they either dont see us or dont see us as a threat   transporter chief  obrien here captain  if your fix on the away team wavers beam them back at once  count on it sir  captain this is incredible  weve entered what appears to be the borg nursery  describe it  it looks as if the borg are born as a biological life form  it seems that almost immediately after birth  they begin artificial implants  apparently they have the technology  to link artificial intelligence directly into the humanoid brain  astounding  commander   what is it  the ship seems to be regenerating  this may explain why they have taken no notice of us  their effort is being directed into repairing this vessel  captain  the borg seem to be using their combined power to repair the ship  transporter chief beam the away team to the bridge  lets get the hell out of here warp eight mr crusher engage  captain the borg are in pursuit  on screen  magnify  increase to ten to the third power  its continuing to regenerate  lets see if we can outrun them mr la forge maximum warp   for as long as we can hold it  yes sir  we are now passing warp 85   warp nine  arm photon torpedoes lets try to slow them down   torpedoes armed  fire   they had no effect  we are now at warp 965  the borg are still gaining  they will follow you until you exhaust your fuel  they will wear down your defences then you will be theirs  admit it picard you should have stayed where you belonged  captains log supplemental  we are unable to maintain the gap from the borg ship  engineering to bridge   go ahead  thats all we can give you   i understand  captain they are firing on us  no reports of any damage to the enterprise  captain the target was not the ship  the weapon was designed to drain the shields  confirmed shield effectiveness has been reduced 12 percent  captain the borg ship is closing  theyre firing again  shields reduced 41 percent another hit and we will be defenceless   arm photon torpedoes  torpedoes armed  fire photons  the borg ship was not damaged  you cant outrun or destroy them  damage them and their essence remains  they regenerate and keep on eventually you will weaken  your reserves will be gone they are relentless  the borg ship is firing  we have lost shields again  captain weve just lost the warp engines  wheres your stubbornness now your arrogance  do you still profess to be prepared for what awaits you  borg ship reestablishing its tractor beam   lock on photon torpedoes  yes sir  without our shields at this range  it is probable a photon detonation could destroy the enterprise   prepare to fire  ill be leaving now  you thought you could handle it so handle it  q  end this  moi  what makes you think im inclined or capable to terminate this  if we all die here  now   you will not be able to gloat  you wanted to frighten us  were frightened  you wanted to show us that we were inadequate  for the moment  i grant that  you wanted me to say i need you  i need you  position   back where we started  that was a difficult admission others would have been humiliated  to say those words another man would have rather died  i understand what youve done here q  but the lesson could have been learned without losing 18 of my crew  if you cant take a bloody nose go home and crawl under your bed  its not safe out here its wondrous  with treasures to satiate desires both subtle and gross  but its not for the timid  mr crusher set course for the nearest starbase  course laid in for starbase 83 sir  engage  q set a series of events into motion  bringing your contact with the borg  much sooner than it should have come  now perhaps when youre ready  it might be possible to establish relations with them  but for now for right now   youre just raw material to them  since they are aware of your existence  they will be coming  you can bet on it  maybe q did the right thing for the wrong reason   how so  well   perhaps what we most needed was a kick in our complacency  to prepare us for what lies ahead
