                captains log stardate 416013  we are crossing through the zed lapis sector  to rendezvous with shuttlecraft 13 carrying deanna troi  who is returning from a conference  because engineering is working on our dilithium crystals  we are traveling on impulse power  deep sensor probes show no obstacles or vessels within three light years  confirm  the martialarts competition is in three days  are you prepared  i will be if you come to the holodeck later  i need help with the mishiama wristlock and break  if it works on you i can use it on anyone  a valid assumption who is your first competitor   science officer swenson  you will defeat him easily  im more concerned with lt minnerlys kick boxing  you are favored in the ships pool   you bet on me  a sure thing  captain  rendezvous with the shuttle in one hour and ten minutes   thank you lieutenant  aye sir  itll be good to have counselor troi back wont it number one  it certainly will  sir im receiving an emergency transmission from the shuttle  on main viewer  i cant were receiving audio only  open the frequency  what a jolt  position report  sir onboard systems failure   tell me where i am  coordinates at 370236 confirm  i cant confirm my instruments are haywire  lt prieto is counselor troi alright  yes sir just a little shaken were being buffeted a bit  losing more power my flightcontrol computers fried  main engineering  lt cmdr leland t lynch here sir  how long before we return to warp power  im realigning the dilithium crystals  there is an emergency we need warp drive how long   20 minutes or more  we dont have it   ill align it by hand  whatever it takes  shuttle this is the enterprise your coordinates now read 237101  ben youre dangerously close to a planet  i can see it  the planet is vagra ii zed lapis sector uninhabited  lieutenant report  this is counselor troi ill relay sir  the pilot is busy weve lost most of our impulse power  engineering status report  working on it three minutes  but there are no guarantees  were out of control were caught in planets gravity  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  captains log supplemental  weve lost contact with shuttlecraft 13  we can only assume theyve crashlanded on vagra ii  meanwhile engineering is trying to return us to warp power  forget the final check  initiate startup sequence   beginning checklist  override  go directly to startup   that is not recommended  understood now  prime matterantimatter injectors  set ratio at 25 to one  ratio set  power engine core inject reactants  leland t lynch here we now have minimum warp drive   course set for vagra ii sir  warp eight  i said minimum warp drive   you heard the order make it so  yes sir  approaching vagra ii  strange sir theres no emergency signal from the shuttle yet  what is this place  there is little information on file beyond the fact of its existence  our sensors show no signs of life forms virtually no vegetation   atmosphere  minimum for our needs sir   standard orbit  aye sir  ive located the shuttle   life signs  not yet sir still probing  it appears to be buried under a lot of debris  i may have something sir  faint life signs   very faint  how many  we cant tell from here  can we beam up the injured  no sir our sensors cannot penetrate this debris   its very unusual  yes sir i cannot explain   number one prepare an away team  data yar  dr crusher have you been monitoring this  yes ill meet the away team in transporter room four  lets go the life signs are weak  what is this  no idea go round to be on the safe side  lets try the other way  enterprise weve got a problem  what kind of problem  im not sure a kind of slick is blocking our path  will keep you apprised   maintain an open frequency  aye sir   analysis mr data  inconclusive sir  i cannot tell you what it is but i can tell you what it is not  explain  no evidence of neural or circulatory systems  no internal organs  cellular structure unknown  no proteins known to us  its narrow here we can get over it   how is it moving  i do not know sir  it does not have a skeletal framework or musculature  then whats causing it to move  it appears to be following us sir  no sign of intelligence no brain yet evidence of thought  insufficient information sir  is it a life form data  again insufficient information sir  theorize  it is possible  very good tin man  what is it number one  what are you seeing  trouble  captains log supplemental  on a mission to rescue survivors from a shuttle crash  the away team has encountered a strange creature  which is able to assume different forms  including one which resembles humanoid  easy lets find out what were dealing with  agreed captain  number one i dont believe the location of the crash  and the proximity of the creature is a coincidence  i am cmdr william riker of the uss enterprise  i am armus why are you here  we mean no harm we have injured crewmen in the shuttlecraft  we need to get to them may we pass  you havent given me a good enough reason  preserving life all life is very important to us  why  we believe everything has a right to exist  an interesting notion which i do not share  you may leave now if you wish  were not going without our crew   i warn you  enough  our people need attention  we wont hurt you but we must help them  number one  the creature attacked us lt yar is down   it seems to feed on our phaser  we had no effect on it  whats lt yars condition   dr crusher report  shes dead  transporter room get them up now  i need her in sickbay now  go to yellow alert lt worf ill be in sickbay  aye sir   status doctor  unchanged   can you bring her back  well see neural stimulator   neural stimulator locked in  interlock current feeds   set sensitivity factor to 44  affirmative  monitoring 23 18   you did it  no shes on total support  there is no independent brain function  current feeds operating  no response her synaptic network is breaking down  inject norep  neurons are beginning to depolarize  direct reticular stimulation   direct  do it  increase to 70 microvolts   again   shes gone  gone  there was too much synaptic damage  that thing sucked the life right out of her  theres nothing i can do  your friends have deserted you  theyre not coming back  youre wrong  i killed one of them  yes  i know  how could you be in there and know that  i felt her die  do you want to know why i killed her  your answer would be meaningless  that act had no reason  exactly it had no meaning  i did it because i wanted to it amused me  no you thought it would amuse you but it didnt  you felt no satisfaction  no  it was too easy  you wanted her to suffer  you have a great need   i need nothing  liar  end this let us go  not yet  they wont give you what you want  and what is that  to break their spirit  is that what i want  if breaking their spirit will amuse me then thats what i will have  never  she didnt do anything her phaser was lowered  she only wanted to get to troi  she was killed in a senseless act  lt yars death is very painful for all of us  we must try to deal with it for now  until the shuttle crew is safely back aboard  our feelings will have to wait understood  lt worf you are now acting chief of security  i will do my best sir  doctor how are the shuttle crew  were receiving faint life signs but the readings fluctuate  they may not be accurate  armus is capable of creating undefined force fields  we cannot communicate or use the transporter unless it allows it  a creature against whom we seem to have no defense   number one  its on that planet waiting for us  it killed tasha and it couldve killed us but it didnt  deanna and ben are alive for a reason  it knows that we wont leave while theyre still alive  youre saying its attack on yar was part of some tactic  to find out we have to go back down  i may see something in the creature thats helpful  agreed prepare an away team  i will remain on the ship  the object is not to engage it in battle  the goal is the safe return of counselor troi and lt prieto  i can best accomplish this at the tactical station  very good number one  were approaching the shuttlecraft the creature is covering it  i lied to you they came back   let me talk with them  no  why does the thought of my having contact with them make you uneasy  no  not being able to contact you not knowing if you are alive  makes them uneasy  cant you feel how worried they are  yes  they are worried  they care for you you must be very special  we are members of a community we all care for one another  equally  you were really surprised they came back  yes  why because the others did not  what others  you cant hide the emptiness from me  the others the ones who hurt you  who left you alone rejected  the ones who make you so angry  what do you know of them  only what you tell me  i will tell you nothing  not now  but soon  captain look at this  the energy field around the shuttle decreased for a few moments  when the creature was draped over it   low enough to beam them out  almost  its approaching the away team  the energy field over the craft is back to full intensity   chart it look for a pattern  aye sir  she said youd be back   then she is alive  for now  why have you returned  weve no choice we must negotiate for our team   what do you want  maybe i want nothing   then you would have killed us all  i still might  what do you want tell me maybe we can reach an accommodation  if i tell you will you give it to me  i might it depends  i am a doctor i need to treat our injured friends  say please  you asked nicely  i will allow it  wait  ive changed my mind talk to her from here  how  troi can you hear me  deanna are you alright  i can hear you  are you alright  yes  weve encountered some difficulty  i know  she needs our help  so what  our friends are suffering meters away yet you block our path why  you are all ungrateful  what is he made of  it did not register on the tricorder  it does that mean i am not alive  no clearly you are some kind of intelligent form  but you said i did not register on your instrument  perhaps your instruments are useless  dont help him  halfmeter to the right  arent you going to lead him to his sight again robot  no you will just move it again   i will not help you hurt him  then give it to him  i will find something else to amuse me  you said they wouldnt amuse me you were right  and the emptiness remains  you sound so alone  i am alone  abandoned  who deserted you  creatures whose beauty now dazzles all who see them  they would not exist without me  you were together  they perfected a means of bringing to the surface  all that was evil and negative within  erupting spreading connecting  in time it formed a second skin dank and vile   you  yes  they discarded you and left  and here i am  you have my pity  your pity  save that for yourself  somethings got me  touch him and he dies  no dont  armus has enveloped cmdr riker  im beaming you up  if any of you leave now he dies  and so do the survivors of the crash  captains log supplemental  there is grave danger to the crew on vagra ii  my first officer is missing  attacked by this entity known as armus  captain take a look at this  the chart of the energy field around the shuttle   a lot of fluctuations  yes but there is a pattern  here is where it killed lt yar  here is where it absorbed cmdr riker  and here here where the energy is lowest  both times it had enveloped the shuttle  it has something to do with counselor troi  somehow when its dealing with her the energy field is affected  i want to talk to her ill beam down  lt worf you have the conn  imzadi  no please stop hurting him  he resists  if he would give himself over the pain would diminish  he struggles you should feel his strength  i can  should i let him go  you only ask to torment me  perhaps  how should i answer  what can i offer except myself  and would you give yourself for him would you give that much  yes without hesitation  just for him  no not just for him  i would do the same for any of the others  armus you have me   let them go  perhaps  another has arrived  you are the one in charge   is cmdr riker alive  answer tin man  i would guess that death is no longer sufficient to alleviate its boredom  therefore cmdr riker is alive  maybe  dont you want to ask me what i want  no  not even to protect your own existence  i want to see my people in the shuttle  entertain me  then i will do it myself  you tin man  tell me how would you feel  if you were the instrument of death for your leader  dont struggle  i do not control the phaser  therefore i would not be the instrument of his death  perhaps killing the doctor would engender more feeling  no the control is still yours  and what about you doctor are you ready to die  tell me you are not afraid  i am afraid   beg me to spare you  no  one of you is going to die and you doctor get to choose  you dont like that do you   then i choose myself  no  you are going to live  one of them dies  maybe this one  though i would not call it death since he is only a device  tell me tin man how does it feel to face your own extinction  curious  you are capable of great sadism and cruelty  interesting no redeeming qualities  so what do you think  i think you should be destroyed  a moral judgment from a machine  armus were finished dealing with you  i have your man in here and the others in the shuttle  no matter we will no longer be a source of amusement  i can kill them  yes but only i can command them they follow my orders  have them amuse me  only if i see my people on the shuttle first  not possible  then our business is concluded  and you claim you care about your comrades  i care which is why i must see them  you want to see your people  then here  look  at this one  hes alive  dont move  is he alright  all signs show normal  so much frustration it had to get rid of me  now let me see the others  no  my people will not entertain you until you do  they are incapable of entertaining me  i want you four out of here enterprise beam up the away team  aye sir  theyre no longer involved this is between you and me  they may leave   now  i want to leave this place  you want me to give you transportation  for which i will trade you lives  i must see my people in the shuttle  will you give me what i want  i have the means but first i must see my people  if you must  troi are you alright  yes but ben is not  hes alive  were you able to help tasha  no  troi we must talk  i believe we can outmaneuver this creature and beam you and ben up  we monitored the energy field around the shuttle  when the creature is here the field weakens   do you know why  the creature is filled with rage  undirected unfocused rage  when he confronts it his guard goes down  because hes feeling it instead of suppressing it  acknowledging his needs makes him vulnerable   what caused the rage  he was left here  abandoned  the force field has to drop below 27 before we can beam them up   satisfied  yes   then can we leave  to go where  do you want to find those who left you here  she told you about them  how long have you been here  since they left  a very long time  a long time to be alone  save your compassion its revolting  you offer it like a prize when in fact its an insult  because you feel unworthy  you overrate your gift you humans are puny weak  but our spirit is indomitable  and still you die from a flake of my power  a great poet once said  all spirits are enslaved that serve things evil  you do not understand  i do not serve things evil i am evil  no you are not  i am a skin of evil left here by a race of titans  who believed if they rid themselves of me  they would free the bonds of destructiveness  yes so here you are feeding on your own loneliness  consumed by your own pain believing your own lies  set the computer  when the energy level reaches  well do a parallel transport on the captain  you say you are true evil  shall i tell you what true evil is  it is to submit to you  to surrender our freedom  our dignity instead of defying you  i will kill you and those in there  but you will still be here  in this place  for ever alone immortal  stand by for parallel transport  the energy level has dropped to 263  thats your real fear  never to die  never again to be united with those who left you  energy field is 26 computer beginning transport  im not taking you anywhere  captains log stardate 416021  the shuttlecraft has been destroyed  to prevent any possibility of armus leaving the planet  vagra ii will be declared offlimits  but the damage has been done  one of the saddest duties i have ever had to perform  is now ahead of me  we are here together to honor our friend and comrade  lt natasha yar  coming to terms with the loss of a colleague  is perhaps the most difficult task we must face  in the work we have chosen to pursue  we will all find time to grieve for her in the days ahead  but for now  she has asked that we celebrate her life  with this  hello my friends  you are here watching this image of me because i have died  it probably happened while i was on duty and quickly  which is what i expected  never forget i died doing exactly what i chose to do  i want you to know how much i loved my life  and those of you who shared it with me  you are my family  you all know where i came from and what my life was like before  but starfleet took that frightened angry girl and tempered her  i have been blessed with your friendship and your love  you are the best  you trusted me  you encouraged me and most of all you made me laugh  you are capable of so much love  you taught me without ever having to say a word  i realized i could be feminine without losing anything  we are so much alike you and i both warriors  orphans who found ourselves this family  i hope i met death with my eyes wide open  your fierce devotion comes from within  it cant be diminished  from you i have learned to strive for excellence  no matter what the personal cost  im sorry i wont be able to see you grow  into the exceptional man youll become  but your kindness and innocence are ageless  in those moments i felt the most despair  you took my hand and helped me to see things differently  you taught me to look beyond the moment  my friend data you see things with the wonder of a child  and that makes you more human than any of us  i wish i could say youve been like a father to me  but ive never had one so i dont know what it feels like  but if there was someone in this universe i could choose to be like  someone who i would want to make proud of me  its you  you who have the heart of an explorer and the soul of a poet  so youll understand when i say  death is that state in which one exists only in the memory of others  which is why it is not an end  no goodbyes  just good memories  hailing frequencies closed sir  au revoir natasha  the gathering is concluded  sir  the purpose of this gathering confuses me  how so  my thoughts are not for tasha  but for myself  i keep thinking how empty it will be without her presence  did i miss the point  no you didnt you got it
