                captains log stardate 416369  as feared our examination of the overdue federation freighter odin  disabled by an asteroid collision revealed no life signs  however three escape pods were missing  suggesting the possibility of survivors   ready to orbit angel one  what kind of place is this data  a classm planet supporting carbonbased flora and fauna  sparsely populated with intelligent life  similar in technological development to mid20th century earth  kinda like being marooned at home  assuming any survivors made it this far  it is the closest planet but to go the distance we did in two days  wouldve taken the odin escape pod five months  five months six days 11 hours two min   thank you data  and 57 seconds  receiving an audio signal from angel one  starfleet are adamant we maintain excellent relations with this planet  mr data is there any other pertinent information before we reply  angel one evolved into a constitutional oligarchy  it is governed by a parliamentary body of six elected mistresses  and headed by a female called the elected one  it sounds like my own planet  klingons appreciate strong women  how current is this information  a federation vessel last visited this planet 62 years ago captain  counselor as this is a femaledominated society  you might wish to make first contact   thank you sir  open hailing frequencies  hailing frequencies open sir  this is counselor deanna troi from the uss enterprise  i am beata the elected one how may we assist you counselor  the federation has neglected to visit your planet for far too long  with your permission we would like to correct that oversight  we feel in no way neglected counselor  a diplomatic courtesy call is not expected nor required  we also come in search of possible survivors from one of our freighters  a brief visit will be tolerated  theyve broken off transmission  ever feel like youre not really wanted  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before   wherere you fellows off to  skiing in the denubian alps   save us some deep powder  sure the holodecks have lots  the away teams ready  angel ones strategic importance in this area may be vital  starfleet hopes they may one day join the federation  well do our best to make a good impression  energize  captains log supplemental  our away team has beamed down to an unusual matriarchal society  where the female is as aggressively dominant  as the male was on earth hundreds of years ago  here the female is the hunter the soldier  larger and stronger than the male  an arrangement considered most sensible and natural  i am beata elected one of angel one  representatives of the enterprise you wish to petition  we do we have reason to hope that survivors  from a damaged federation freighter may be marooned on your planet  we are seeking to learn if this is so  even a world as remote as angel one has heard of starfleet  searching for survivors seems a petty task for one of their vessels  we dont consider even one survivor petty  is this man implying that we put a lesser value on life than you do  not at all our discovery of the freighter was unexpected  we have a duty to investigate  i see  and if you find any survivors what then  we would take them with us and reunite them with their families  are we to take these strangers at their word  good question  what reason could we have to deceive you  another good question  are there survivors from the freighter odin on your planet  im not prepared to answer yet  see to their comforts  whats going on  you will remain here until summoned  is this area secure can we talk  yes no listening devices or anything of a threatening nature   good troi  there was much fear in that room  paranoia id say but of what  i cannot say but their fear was not focused  i sensed they were all not concerned for the same reason  undoubtedly there are survivors from the odin on this planet  i agree otherwise why would they be so circumspect  as mistress beata is so fond of saying good question  what do we do if they deny there are survivors  lets not look for problems  have everyone prepare for a trip into the neutral zone  as soon as the away team returns  trouble captain  insurance romulan battle cruisers have been detected  near one of our border posts  theyve requested our assistance as soon as  report mr crusher  we finished our ski lesson sir and it kinda just happened  on the enterprise nothing just happens what is that smell  hm reminiscent of nightblooming throgni captain from home  quite stimulating isnt it  no  i dont smell anything im a little congested the snow  dont let this just happen again mr crusher  yes sir  interesting an alcoholbased synthetic  artificially reproducing a floral scent  its called perfume data  and the purpose is  certain cultures consider perfume an aphrodisiac  i am unfamiliar with that term  an aphrodisiac is something used to stimulate or enhance  sexual pleasure  how does stimulation of olfactory nerves affect the enjoyment of sex  the elected one will see you now  you say you will remove these survivors from our world  are you ready to give your word on that  we are  you should know that the vote was not unanimous  some of those among us are suspicious  yet the majority feel we have to trust you  we do not understand your misgivings but appreciate your faith in us  make certain that faith is not misplaced  there are four survivors from the ship you call odin  all male their leader is a man who calls himself ramsey  if youll deliver them to us well have them off your planet at once  if they were mine to deliver i would without hesitation  unfortunately their hiding place eludes us  hiding place why are they in hiding  because theyre fugitives here and the quicker theyre gone the better  when these men came to us seven years ago they accepted our hospitality  but they gradually became restive  started making unreasonable demands went against the natural order  using our technology we might be able to find these men  i assumed as much but be warned counselor these men are dangerous  sickbay to capt picard  picard here  wesley and a friend have contracted a respiratory ailment  a respiratory ailment is it contained  i hope so ive isolated the 12 students who were on the field trip  how contagious is it  still running tests  the key is to figure out how the virus is transmitted  so far ive ruled out persontoperson contact  keep at it starfleet has important business for us  once the away team returns  i dont fancy the idea of my crew being infected  data whats the best way to find ramsey and the other survivors  if we can isolate something unique to the odin survivors  an element not otherwise found on angel one  we can utilize the enterprise scanners  mr data will need access to your library  our librarys far too sophisticated for a man to comprehend  i am an android mistress though anatomically i am a male  an amusing notion  maybe you could teach our males something  trent see to the androids needs   bridge to picard  go ahead lieutenant  the away team requests that we scan the planets surface for platinum  have mr la forge break fixed orbit and initiate a search pattern  aye captain   geordi  search pattern initiated now  this was delivered for you  good its for my meeting with beata  youre not going to wear that  yes part of this mission is diplomatic  i have an audience with a head of state  i will honor her by wearing indigenous apparel  i dont believe this youre going to parade around like one of them  why what is this attitude  on kabatris i wore furs to meet with the leaders on armus ix feathers  this objection doesnt have anything to do with  beata being an attractive woman does it  this is quite unnecessary im fine  youre infected with the virus  in my opinion you are not able to command this vessel  that is ridiculous  i have an away team down in unfriendly territory  and also have an appointment with several romulan battle crui  you have an appointment in your cabin with your bed   is that an order doctor  yes   i think i may sneeze  a klingon sneeze  only kind i know  lt la forge you have command until further notice   make the proper ships log entries  aye sir  scanners indicate a platinum trace  shall i notify the away team  make it so  what do you think  well  i gotta say its kinda sexy  thank you lieutenant actually it feels quite comfortable  how handsome you look  thank you  the enterprise reports a possible location for the survivors   so soon im impressed  im suspicious  you dont believe me  not yet i hear the words but not the sincerity  you objected earlier ariel you were in the minority  after seven years the great ship enterprise  comes to repatriate a small group of insignificant people  mistress ariel i hear the words but not the sincerity  you should listen more carefully excuse me mistress  i have matters to attend to elsewhere  with permission wed like to begin our search immediately  by all means  but im sure counselor troi and the others can see to that without you  if i recall you had a gesture of goodwill for me  that can wait until weve recovered the survivors  are you suggesting the women in your party  cannot accomplish that without a man  not at all lt yar and counselor troi are completely qualified  youre very generous with your praise  inform them that you will remain here with me  riker to lt yar  this is yar  for diplomacy ill stay with mistress beata  while you conduct our search   commander  you have your instructions  relax we have much to discuss   set phasers to stun  i wish they werent necessary  a justified precaution counselor  mistress beata observed that mr ramsey and his men are dangerous   yar to enterprise  go ahead  three to beam to that platinum trace   coordinates set  energize  welcome  ive been expecting you  picard to bridge  la forge here   status report  82 more cases of the virus sir  dr crushers converted the holodeck into an isolation ward  and the away team  well no recent contact sir  but i informed them of our medical situation  and of the growing romulan threat to our neutral zone outpost  keep me advised you have the bridge until cmdr riker returns  engineering reports a computer mal  im sorry  im getting sick  half the ship knows that by now  report to sickbay lieutenant  engineering to bridge  la forge here  the computer wont accept the climate controls  on my way  with respect lieutenant there are people to do that job now  la forge to engineering  lt wong knows that system im sure she can resolve all problems  thanks for the advice  how did you find me  actually it was quite simple  angel one has no platinum enterprise scanners did the rest  platinum was it  my wings i kept them for their sentimental value  where are the other survivors mr ramsey  theyre nearby theyre packing since we cant remain here  seven years on an alien planet  and i sense no anticipation no excitement at being rescued  what do you think youre rescuing me from  my shipmates and i have taken wives a few even have children  you cant rescue a man from a place that he calls his home  why were you so hesitant to tell us about the survivors  because ramsey and his men are anarchists  i had to be sure you werent here to fuel their struggle  i like the way your eyes pick up the color of your tunic  we do not interfere in the domestic affairs of other societies  but you can interact  of course otherwise how can we learn  is that why youre here with me tonight to learn  yes   about our society  yes  well in our society it is the men who are the fortunate ones  enjoying all life has to offer  while we women devote ourselves to the obligation of making life work  in our society we share the responsibilities and pleasures  which is why i am here with you while the women look for ramsey  remind me to thank them when they come back for giving us this time  you resist dont you find me attractive  yes i find you very attractive  you attract me like no man ever has  its not my function to seduce or be seduced  by the leader of another world   its not the reason  no  but will you still respect me tomorrow  i hope so  thank you trent  you may go  compliments of the uss enterprise  its called an albeni meditation crystal  very impressive  now i must repay you in kind  five months in a rescue pod no bigger than this room  is an eternity i hope none of you will ever have to face  when we finally made it here  we thought wed died and gone to heaven youve seen the women here  theyre tall and strong and very lovely  but after the newness wore off we saw how the men were treated  theres no votes theres no opinions  theres no respect  none of which is your concern any longer mr ramsey  call the others in please its time to leave  despite their problems we like it here on angel one  were not going anywhere  but mistress beata  be damned her wish is not my command and neither is yours  you cant force us to go  mr ramsey is correct  the odin was not a starship  so her crew is not bound by the prime directive  if he and the others wish to stay here there is nothing we can do  bridge to sickbay how are you doing doctor  we have more sick than we do beds  so far ive had to confine over 300 to their private quarters  were going to be badly undermanned if we engage the romulans in battle  the romulans are your problem lieutenant  finding an inoculant is mine  this virus mutates every 20 minutes  but we havent had any fatalities yet  if this continues therell be no one to run the ship  if this continues lt la forge  nobody will be healthy enough to care  yar to enterprise  enterprise here go ahead  prepare to beam three to our previous location  after regrouping with cmdr riker well return to the ship  make that on the double we have a medical emergency brewing here  one third of the crew is down and word from the neutral zone is  more romulan vessels are converging there  ill inform the commander yar out  one thing before we go  you said you were expecting us why  i cant answer that  we wish you well mr ramsey  energize  theyre gone  how refreshing to be with a man who knows what he wants  and doesnt have to be told by a woman  exactly  i knew you were bright enough to understand  see women by our very nature want only what is best for their men  men are not objects to be possessed mistress beata  of course theyre not  it was merely a figure of speech  enter  what is so important that you intrude upon my privacy  they have returned mistress but without ramsey or the others  your advanced technology has proven inadequate  what happened  mr ramsey and the other survivors refused to leave  you gave me your solemn word  im sorry theres nothing else we can do  im sorry as well  since you refuse to take them with you  i am left with no choice but to sentence them all to death  come  it looks horrible tastes worse  but its absolutely guaranteed to make you feel better  i knew youd like it are you wearing cologne  like something i smelled earlier something klingon  lt worf and i detected the same scent  when we bumped into your son at the holodeck  its that smell  thats how the virus travels  an airborne particle whose sweet scent inspires deep inhalation  and once inside the body it becomes that damn virus  i have work to do  you are excused doctor  whats the latest on the medical situation  dr crusher feels the virus will run unchecked through the entire ship  attempts to develop an inoculant have ended in failure  lt la forge still has bridge command pending your return sir  and the romulans entering the neutral zone  the outpost reports seven romulan battle cruisers within sensor range  the uss berlin answered the distress call  however if hostilities erupt  the outpost and the starship will be outgunned  they feel the enterprises presence will be a vital show of force  some show of force the enterprise could fly on autopilot  but with that virus around well be in sorry shape if things turn ugly  its time we leave  it doesnt feel right with beata determined to execute those people  she has to find them first theyve been fugitives for years  they must be good at evading capture  somethings wrong  before you go back to your ship theres something i want you to see  we were no harm to anyone why did you tell them where we were  you brought this upon yourself you and the traitor  one does not need technology to follow mistress ariel  sneaking out to warn her husband  let her stand with him now  for tomorrow they will die together  your advanced society uses executions  to suppress those who reject your views   i dont expect you to understand  why because im only a man  youll accomplish nothing with that attitude  mistress beata  if you had an alternative to executing ramsey and his followers  would you take it  is that not the way of an advanced society  then let us meet with them one last time  let me try to convince them to leave with us  will you include others here  who choose to follow ramsey and his group  yes all of them  mistress beata is willing to give you a second chance  were prepared to take your entire group with us  thats very kind of you  but were not going  havent you been paying attention ramsey  youre scheduled to be executed tomorrow  we dont want to die  we dont want to leave either  theres no time to debate the issues youre leaving like it or not  excuse me commander but removing these people against their will  would violate several regulations including the prime directive  i realize that mr data  id rather face a courtmartial  than live with the guilt of leaving these people to their death   cmdr riker to the enterprise  enterprise crusher here  must be worse there than we thought  doctor wheres lt la forge  hes right here but hes in bad shape  notify the transporter room i have 14 to beam up  i cant allow it  this virus is totally out of control here  doctor these people are facing their deaths down here  they might be facing the same here  until i have a better idea of what this is no one beams up  im sorry will but you must wait  understood doctor would this virus have any effect on mr data  not likely  youre going back there alone  get the enterprise into the neutral zone before its too late  this is data standing by to beam up  what of them  i dont know  mistress beata invites you to witness this mornings reaffirmation  of angel ones moral imperative  is that the civilized word for murder on this world  you send mistress beata our regrets   the elected one will not  enterprise to cmdr riker   theyre still here  riker here  i said to go to the neutral zone immediately explain the delay  actually sir you ordered me to reach the neutral zone  before it is too late  after relieving lt la forge i computed the length of time  the outpost and the uss berlin can withstand a romulan attack  and deducted our time to destination at maximum warp speed  that leaves dr crusher 48 minutes  to develop an inoculant to the virus   so we still have time to act  48 minutes   perhaps data perhaps  thank you for following my orders so precisely  on second thought trent  we would be honored to witness your moral imperative in action  we have determined that the heretical teachings of ramsey and his followers  are inconsistent with harmonious life on angel one  our patient efforts to silence revolutionary voices have failed  therefore we are left with none but the most final alternative  as you can see we are not without compassion  your deaths will be swift and painless  mistress beata before we see living examples of your compassion  may i speak  is this a plea for leniency  nothing of the sort  as the governing body here  youre entitled to execute your laws or your citizens as you see fit  make your point so we can proceed with this unpleasant business  when you spoke of the prisoners you used the term revolutionary  indeed death has been known to stop revolutions  but i suspect its not a revolution that angel one is hoping to stop  its evolution  mr ramsey and the odin survivors  did not initiate the waves of dissent rippling through your planet  their presence here merely reinforced  the change in attitudes between men and women that was already under way  they became symbols around whom those with similar views gathered  you may eliminate the symbols  but that does not mean death to the issues those symbols represent  no power in the universe can hope to stop the force of evolution  be warned  the execution of mr ramsey and his followers  may elevate them to the status of martyrs  martyrs cannot be silenced  stop  we will adjourn to consider your words  thank you  i dont know if it was enough   sickbay to bridge  go ahead doctor  bingo data  bingo i fail to see the relevance doctor  is that not an ancient earth game  its also a reference to success ive got the inoculant  excellent doctor we still have 17 minutes left  i will inform the away team immediately enterprise to riker  we are now ready to beam you up commander  data ramsey and the prisoners are with us in the great hall  lock in the transporter prepare to evacuate the entire group   but for now stand by  understood commander  on consideration this legislature has voted to stay the execution  their children will be returned immediately  do not rejoice prematurely  ramsey and his followers are to be exiled  to a distant and unpopulated region  life will be difficult there  with little time for revolutionary or evolutionary upheaval  as some observed we may not be able to stop evolution  but perhaps we can reduce it to a slow crawl  for a man you can be very clever cmdr riker  riker to enterprise  belay my previous order mr data  there will now be only three to beam up energize  welcome home  its good to be back   are they recovering  slowly but yes  and the captain  the captain is fine thank you  mr data has been briefing me on the away teams comportment number one  we improvised sir  i look forward to your reports   time to pay the romulans a call  set course for the neutral zone  warp six  coordinates set warp six on your mark sir  sir  engage
