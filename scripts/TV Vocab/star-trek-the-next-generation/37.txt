                captains log stardate 426254  we are entering orbit around the eighth planet  in this previously unmapped theta 116 solar system  we diverted from our course when a passing klingon cruiser  reported discovering pieces of a strange vessel  in the upper atmosphere of this planet  we have come to investigate  nasty nitrogen methane liquid neon  surface temperature minus 291 degrees celsius  winds up to 312 meters per second  not exactly a vacation planet  unless you like ammonia tornadoes  but i have found indications of debris in an elliptical orbit  keep me informed the sooner we know what the klingons saw  the sooner we can get out of here  sounds good to me  nasty  come  fermats last theorem youre familiar with it  vaguely i spent too many math classes daydreaming about starships  when pierre de fermat died they found this equation  scrawled in the margin of his notes  x to the nth plus y to the nth equals z to the nth  where n is greater than two which had no solution in whole numbers  but he also added this phrase remarkable proof  its coming back to me there was no proof included  for 800 years people have been trying to solve it   including you  i find it stimulating  also it puts things in perspective  in our arrogance we feel we are so advanced  and yet we cannot unravel a simple knot  tied by a parttime french mathematician  working alone without a computer  captain weve found some debris in a loose orbit   can you identify it  no  we could beam a section aboard for analysis  make it so number one  weve locked onto something with markings   of what sort  uncertain energize  weve got ourselves a puzzle number one  sir i guess we have  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  analysis shows that the object was terrestrial in origin  dated mid21st century  no no earth ship of that time could have travelled out this far  that is what our tests indicate  and the markings are consistent with this hypothesis  any indication of what destroyed it data  that is more significant than the object itself  on several surfaces the molecules have disintegrated  disintegrated how  almost as if they were hit by a weapon from our time  curiouser and curiouser  captain weve detected a large structure on the planet  its a building of some sort stood on a plane of frozen methane  smack in the middle of a storm belt  incredible its surrounded by breathable air  is there any connection with that ship fragment we found   unknown sir  suggestions  just one we could go down and have a look  breathable air no life forms that might be dangerous  i think we could risk a minimal away team number one  give me a moment gents this is an extremely narrow access point  phasers on stun  ready when you are  weve got it you have a green light commander  energize  those ammonia storms are less than a kilometer away  yet they do not penetrate this breathable zone   its like the eye of a hurricane  commander what is that  a door  the structure must be here yet we cannot see it  enterprise this is cmdr riker  as your readout shows this is an unusual place  completely calm no sound no movement  yet a few hundred meters away a storm is raging  any information about the structure  there is an antique revolving door could be an entrance  a revolving door number one proceed with caution  yes sir  well this is what we came here for captain were entering  enterprise to away team come in  were receiving no signal at all from them sir  transporter room lock on to them beam them up  weve nothing to lock on to sir  riker to enterprise weve entered the structure  riker to enterprise come in  come in enterprise  when they went through that door the signal disappeared sir  whats causing the interference   unknown  are they receiving us  no well have to recalibrate all the frequencies to find one that works  then do it  sir without communication we should beam up immediately  were here theres no danger well look around then leave  checking in gentlemen use the front desk  very good well start with that  welcome gentlemen  have a nice trip   do you know us  weve been expecting you  a trio of foreign gentlemen  were from the united federation of planets  of course you are welcome to the hotel royale  excuse me did rita call   im busy  youre busy  this is my life im talking about now did rita call or not  no and for your own good youd better quit thinking about rita  im not afraid of mickey d  then youre a fool anybody with any sense is afraid of mickey d  if rita calls you let me know  kids asking for trouble ritas too much for him to handle  and mickey d will plant his face in the pavement  now here are your room keys  and some complimentary casino chips  enjoy  what is this place  how did a being like you get here  why this is the royale of course  and my personal life is none of your business thank you   he means what planet is this  i beg your pardon  this planet what do you call it  earth what do you call it  we call it theta viii  how charming   commander  yes data  none of these people are emitting life signs  you mean theyre not alive  then what are they  these beings  are they machines  or mere illusions designed to deceive us  not illusion lieutenant they do exist  but they do not register as either man or machine  take this creature for example  he does not exhibit any dna structure  excuse me son  look whos talking  man you sound just like my exwife  alright time to get down to business  what sort of business do you suppose he is getting down to  status report  were trying alternate encoding schemes  there could be hundreds of combinations  is there an intelligence causing this interference  thats impossible to tell captain  its unlike cmdr riker not to follow procedure  when he lost contact with us  he should have returned to the beamdown coordinates  i dont feel hes in any danger  in fact if i could choose one word to assess his mood  it would be amused  amused  put some chips there mister yes sirree   youre new here arent you  yes sir  sit down im gonna teach you how this game is played boy  go ahead ante up  he wants you to cut the cards   is this poker  no blackjack  blackjack accessing  also known as 21 the number which defines the object of the game  picture cards are worth ten aces one or eleven  all other cards face value  boy youre right  pretty smooth  run em boy make em nice   21 21   dont look at your hand honey  that gal has got to win  now honey you got 15 and the dealers showing ten  do i hit texas or do i stand  if youve gotta win youve gotta hit  hit me  damn  shoot hit me   hit me   another  do you think youve had enough  if the objective of the game is to approach a total of 21 points   i definitely need another card  yeah  you have got the brass  do you know the odds on a fivecard charlie  hell youre just throwing your money away  hit me  howd you  shut my mouth  are you one of them cardcounting fellas  the number of the cards and their values  remain constant where is the purpose in counting them   yeah  having fun data  fun sir  there is a certain amount of enjoyment but im researching   save it lets get out of here  yes sir   youre holding up the game  our apologies  ill watch your chips  thank you sir  the hat  sorry sir  deal em up  progress  weve accessed the range of alternates  the problem is the frequency range interference is highly variable  it may be due to the envelope over the structure  causing hydrogencarbon helix patterns throughout  so transmissions are scattered and refracted at random   no wonder you cant get through  exactly  those are fairly aggressive computations  im comparing the molecular integrity of that bubble against our phasers   is penetration possible  i dont know it may be an option  id like to run this test  make it so  lets try that again  lets find another way out of here  excuse me  excuse me aside from the main door is there another exit i might use  excuse  excuse me  say i was wondering if you could tell me  theres a good deal of structural integrity worf   permission to use phaser sir  granted  sir i can find no other exits i believe we are trapped here  captains log supplemental  we remain in orbit around theta viii  still out of contact with the away team  were almost there captain we can attempt contact in a few minutes  captain the situation down there has changed  in what way  cmdr riker has become tense  closed in hes feeling trapped  phasers are ineffective on all surfaces   our options appear limited  we dont have any  were going to have to get out on our own  i want some answers from that desk clerk  are you crazy  wrong im finally gettin some smarts  you wont scare mickey d with that gun  ill make him leave rita alone  kid shes a big girl and shes mickey ds girl  not any more not after tonight  look kid i dont wanna see you get hurt especially over some dame  dont call her that  youll see youll see how tough mickey d is  hes nothin   i want some answers  the concierge   i want to get out of here  the exits are clearly marked  thats not good enough  if you have a complaint you can always take it up with the manager  fine id like to see him now  im afraid the manager is very busy   riker can you read me  yes  theres a good deal of interference but you are getting through  why havent you left that building  we tried sir were trapped were in no immediate danger  but i am concerned  your location is interfering with communication we are working on it  standing by sir   these frequencies are unstable  then find others  what is going on down there  commander  i am picking up something unusual in another area of this structure   it appears to be human dna  where  and to the right of us  perhaps those turbo lifts could take us there  seems to be malfunctioning  the reading i received is from behind this door sir  my reading is intensifying sir   are you getting any life signs  none sir  definitely human male  looks like the poor devil died in his sleep  what a terrible way to die  he has been dead for 283 years sir  the lack of advanced decomposition is due to the sterile environment  why would anyone go to all this trouble  its just windowdressing for a dead man  commander  is this significant sir  american   places it between 2033 and 2079 ad  it correlates with the debris we found  colonel s richey  rest in peace colonel  picard to riker  finally riker go ahead   coming through clearly now  whats your situation  this structure was made to resemble 20thcentury earth  all attempts to exit have failed  we cant transport you back yet  i assumed not we have also found human remains  request identity scan col richey american first initial s   roughly the same time period  do it  commander  some curiosities  books a novel  hotel royale summarize please  information retrieved captain   number one  go ahead captain  we have the information you requested  col steven richey was the co of the explorer ship charybdis  which had a terrestrial launch date of july 23 2037  it was the third manned attempt to travel beyond earths solar system  its telemetry failed it was never heard from again  do you believe youve discovered the remains of col richey  yes and weve found something else a novel by todd matthews  hotel royale the name of this structure  data  captain this is the story of a group of compulsive gamblers  caught up in crime corruption and deceit  it is told by nefarious lothario mickey d  who appears only at the climax  to carry out the coldblooded murder of the hotel bellboy  there is a subplot about an older man conspiring with a young woman  to murder her husband she squanders her inheritance  everything that data just described seems to be happening at this hotel  extraordinary  theres also a diary with only one entry  obviously made by colonel richey   can you read it  yes  i write this in the hope that it will some day be read by human eyes  i can only surmise that our exploratory shuttle  was contaminated by an alien life form  which infected and killed all personnel except myself  i awakened to find myself here in the royale hotel  precisely as described in the novel in my room   and for the last 38 years  i have survived here  i have come to understand  that the aliens created this place for me out of some sense of guilt  presuming that the novel we had on the ship about the hotel royale  was in fact a guide to our preferred lifestyle and social habits  they thought this was the world from which i came  i hold no malice for my benefactors  who could not know the hell they put me through   for it was such a badly written book  filled with endless clich and shallow characters  i shall welcome death when it comes  i understand number one  now we know why all that is there  why cant you get out   number one  yes sir  lt la forge has a thought  he believes we can phaser a slice in the field around the structure  then the atmosphere of the planet would rush in  projected survival would be approximately 12 seconds  correct the cryogenic process would be nearly instantaneous   i assume you could revive us  yes   in theory  you must understand number one  well wait for months if necessary were just considering options  if youre trying to motivate us to find a way out youve succeeded  yes  there is a female voice asking if we want room service  i believe she is asking if we want the room cleaned  tell her no  no  what did she say  she said the kitchen will be open  lets explore the hotel well keep a comm line open  check the lobby for anything we missed  talk to the guests find out who they are  ill check the rest of the floors  computer locate and display the text of the novel  entitled hotel royale by todd matthews  accessing  if the cause of the difficulties is in the novel  we may find the solution within its pages  it was a dark and stormy night  its not a promising beginning  it may get better  i suggest we separate and blend in with these beings  casual queries offered inconspicuously may prove fruitful  i need a four gimme a four  damn  how much do i have left here  honey its bad luck to count your chips at the table  excuse me sir might i enquire where are you from  lubbock texas  and how did you get here  vegas drove my car i got a 91 caddy with only 85 miles on it   where is your automobile now  out front i suppose   what difference does it make  could you take me there  hit me  im losing my shirt  son why would i want to do that im trying to help this little lady  i believe you are trapped inside the royale just as i am  sure seems that way when youre losing  were tryin to turn this ladys wagon around win back some change  else shes in a desperate situation with nowhere to turn  well almost nowhere  i stay right  i wouldnt  the odds favour standing pat  what do i do  do you want a card or not  hit me  too many  ive almost lost it all  what am i gonna do  there there   what did you find  nothing   rita just called  what did she say  it was hard to tell she was crying  crying damn mickey d thinks he can treat people any way he wants  well thats all over now  you were told  its not for you to make the call its for rita  well she sent me to tell you  ok boys look we cant afford trouble in here  why dont you take this outside  yeah i like that come on baggage man  lets you and me take it outside  when i was a kid i looked up to you guys  the suit the fancy shoes  i really thought that made you somebody  but youre a nobody i wish i could make something  i dont believe this dialogue did humans really talk like that  not in real life remember everything going on down there  is taken from what col richey calls a secondrate novel  she could do something with her life  with your permission sir  shes somebody shes my girl  the only reason she stays with you is because you feed her sickness  you gotta let me help her  why dont we go outside and talk about it  just watch yourself  dont worry  its all part of the novel dont interfere  you shouldve listened to me kid  no womans worth dyin for  killing for   not dyin for   riker to enterprise  yes number one  a bizarre incident just took place  the shootout between the bellboy and mickey d  yes and mickey d just walked out how  its on page 244  the novel right how does it end  a bad love affair ends in a bloody shootout  the hotel gets bought out  and life goes on such as it is  the hotel gets bought by whom  its not specific it refers to foreign investors  sale price 125 million united states dollars  they return home leaving the assistant manager in charge  captain   thats how were getting out  were buying this place  it is a question of probability  quite simple if one bets with sequential consistency  elaborate  combinations of seven or eleven have much value  if achieved on the primary attempt  with eight variations to create those totals   the chance is not significant  ok   can you do it  i believe so sir  eights the point eighter from decatur do it  snake eyes  single digits on each cube are not at all desirable   youre almost broke  relax honey its only money  if you lose it i might not have a place to sleep  dont worry your head honey id never let that happen  lets go babe here they come  seven   your turn slick  go to work  maybe this turkey will bring us some luck   six is your number  my blind grandma can make a six  come on roll em  i thought seven and eleven had value  actually six is a valid point  now the objective is to roll a duplicate six then a seven  but the probability of a six is no greater than a seven  there is a degree of random fortune involved  that is why they call it gambling  yeah  seven seven away next shooter   so much for your new turkey  give slick another shot  i got a feeling about you boy  commander these cubes are improperly balanced their resting position   can you repair them  i believe so  i will make another attempt  baby needs a new pair of shoes  eleven attaboy do that again were all gonna get well   seven a winner  and another one  keep goin boy we got a hot one   double em up here we go  keep em rollin boy  seven a winner  status number one  rather a nice run of luck captain   dont get out of character  sir  the foreign investors in the book are seen as flamboyantly generous  yes sir i understand  seven look at that  tex darlin   youre brilliant  yeah and im goodlookin too   isnt that enough  no dont want to come up short   you are keeping count  yes sir 123 million  perhaps i will bet 700000  no bet it all  sir the price of this edifice is 125 million  we need some spreading around money   sir  bet it all  here something for you ziggy  for the cocktail waitresses run this out to the parking lot attendant   youre very kind sir  here a little something for you  thank you  when the train comes in everybody rides  yeah and im getting off at this station  after 18 passes air gets a little thin for this country boy   im bettin against you fella  are you nuts  that is not a prudent choice sir  thats what horse racings about roll em  seven a winner  the man has the touch  you knew you were going to throw that seven  you let me go down the tube  i tried to caution you sir  what was it was it personal or what  because i didnt show you my car  now  i wish to cash in sir  im afraid youve broken the bank  just take 125 million for this hotel spread the rest around  youre the foreign investors  thats right  we just bought this place lock stock and barrel  consider it a done deal  i like you fellas  you got style let me buy you guys a drink  just enjoy the game dont let them change the dice on you  you got it  enterprise this is the away team were clear  three to beam up  time to come home now number one  transporter room lock on the away team beam them up  come   sir  welcome back number one  very strange experience puzzling  i cant comprehend how col richeys vessel travelled so far  not on its own at any rate  perhaps they were brought here  by whoever created that makebelieve world  its possible they didnt know how fragile the humans aboard were  only one of them survived  none of it makes any sense  like fermats theorem its a puzzle we may never solve
