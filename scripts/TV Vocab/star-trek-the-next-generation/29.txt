which is a rare occasion for a man of my charm and talent  mute main viewer counsellor  his emotions suggest he is mischievous irreverent  and somewhat brazen  the word that seems to best describe him is rogue  rogue cad knave rake rascal villain wild element  yes data but there is no malevolence or ill will  audio on you have a burnout in your guidance system  if you can diagnose my problems why not help fix them  captain we can easily repair the system he uses   we can accommodate you  first officer here  if you shut down your engines we can beam you over  sir recommend limited access to our ship   agreed  data lock on him   prepare to beam him aboard  ready on your command  excuse me commander is that a womans voice i hear  yes follow cmdr rikers instructions   so we can get back to our routine  whatever you say captain  something funny  well the unexpected is our normal routine  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilisations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  hold it steady wesley  ready to link on my command  aye sir  easy  engage   captain

wesley crusher  nice to meet you wesley wesley crusher  and thank you for beaming me here  and enabling me to see a truly beautiful woman  you have a majestic carriage and loveliness  that surely traces back to the noblest families  im sure youve said that to many and it was not true then either  but its how i say it thats really important  the warmth the attraction that i have for you  the attraction that we share  mr okona appears to have excellent vision as well as a healthy libido  its 806  capt okona if you follow cmdr data you can start right away  now thats sex appeal  sexual attraction in this context is not part of my programming  i am an android  well have you seen any goodlooking computers lately  thats a joke its funny  of course it is   thatll do what the original did  it sure will and better  let me show you  on your old one the zelebium contacts wore down  what ive done is replace them with tricellite  tricellite isnt available here if i had to replace them  no need your ship will never outlast this part  because of the part or the way i fly  this part but you do tend to push your ship beyond its capabilities  blame the pattern of my life lieutenant  it relegates me to cargo carrying rather than your grand explorations  so i am forced to add some flamboyancy and zest  to the doldrums of my existence   have you ever been cold  no   warm then  no   what about drunk ever do that  that is not possible for me  pity what about love   the act or the emotion  theyre both the same  i believe that statement to be inaccurate sir  maybe  life is like loading twice your cargo weight onto your spacecraft  if its canaries and you keep half of them flying all the time  youre alright  i doubt that statement is accurate either  accurate that was a joke i just told   i do not understand  you dont know what a joke is  of course it is a witticism a gag a bon mot  words concluding with a trick ending  thats the dictionary meaning i mean humour fun  dyou know what funny is  where is 806  right over there sir why  you probably wouldnt understand that either  hello there   status on the repair  working on it  commander what do you think of capt okona  well okona is an interesting man weve seen how he handles his ship  apparently he can handle people as well   then why does he work alone  he lives by his own rules  he does what he does by his choice  someday youll make yours  i already have  you agree with okona that i am missing an important human factor  i never said that i simply said that ive never seen you laugh  i am capable of that

hes saying his anger is genuine  open  what crimes are they  neither important nor necessary i want okona now  another class7 armed spacecraft is approaching   from the opposite sector  another ship

kushell  from the legation of unity of straleb   i am capt jeanluc picard  we know who you are  weve been monitoring your communications  and we know of the demands made by debin of atlec  then you know we have no hostile intention  you only have to concede to one demand  that word demand has a tone of finality  it is a word i have chosen  we demand that you turn okona over to us immediately  mute  mr okona to the bridge immediately  open  the same demand has been made by the atlecs  i have no interest in their request  but we intend to back up our rights to okona  i would rather not escalate the situation any further  our honour and prestige are at stake  we are ready to take okona by force and die in the doing of it  i trust that that can be avoided  i will respond to your request shortly viewer off  capt okona has not responded  hes been reported in three different crew quarters   find him get him up here  yes sir  come with me to the main bridge  im sure it can wait a few minutes  now  id like that  but i have my orders  some other time  remember what it took to drag me from you  am i going to meet capt picard   definitely  did i say something funny  capt picard this is thadium okona  mr okona you were welcomed aboard without undue investigation  it was assumed that you did not come under false pretences  but it seems that you may have done  if you mean my socialising with the members of the crew  mr okona you are free to socialise with the members of my crew  im talking about a man named debin  from atlec i know some of his family  perhaps you can explain why he is threatening to attack us   unless i give him custody of you  i cant  then tell me why kushell of straleb is demanding the same thing   hes here also  and quite adamant  mr okona what crimes are you accused of   i am not a criminal  why do these men want you   i cant say  theyre threatening to attack   thats mad theyd have no chance  right  so you can offer no reason why they are set on this provocative course  i cant think of one right now  on viewer   which ship  what  the first one capt debin  captain let me ask you again what are okonas crimes  that is not your concern   it is if you wish him released  alright  you want to know what he did why i have chased him across this system  this is his crime  he dishonoured my daughter  he took advantage of her then left her carrying his bastard child  hell return and do the right thing  or ill hunt him through the galaxy  captains log supplemental  some of the mystery surrounding this ancient morality play  has been revealed  one of capt okonas pursuers is an outraged father  with a heartfelt if arcane sense of righteousness  your advice counsellor  we are dealing with ancient codes involving procreation  they are meaningless to us but to debin they represent honour  he will fight  risking himself his crew his daughter and her unborn child  your counsellors right he will fight  the other captain is demanding to be heard  i dont suppose you have any idea why this man wants you  lets put all this together  lt worf multiple image full conference mode   let them all see each other  yes sir  here you are debin trying to save this criminal   my purpose is not your concern  it is if it involves okona  gentlemen please lets try and resolve this matter  capt kushell what crime has okona allegedly committed  he is a thief he stole the jewel of thesia a national heritage  a thing an item  my case involves the victimisation of my daughter and my honour   ill have okona now  he is mine  one at a time who accuses me of stealing   my son benzan and i  father please   he used you to become my friend  he used my daughter  he used my son to plunder a national treasure  mute  terminate communications come with me  captain you cant be afraid of them  no they couldnt hurt the enterprise  my predicament is you  im sorry my ship broke down im sorry youre involved  but youre right whatever happens someone gets hurt   if i go to kushell debin fights  if you go to debin the same  i wish i could   i wish i could make it easier  im sure you do  i wont apologise for the way i am or how i live my life  but i did not steal the jewel of thesia  i am not a criminal captain  as to the other business  thats between me and yanar no one else  in truth i do not have authority in this matter  i am not your judge nor is it my duty to arbitrate  but you are in my custody which creates a dilemma  how about this do what you said fix my guidance system and let me go  according to regulations that is what i should do  but their ships are faster than yours im doing you no favour  captain with all due respect thats not your concern  besides i can take care of myself  youre quite a craftsman lt la forge how soon  whats the rush i thought you liked it here  i did it stopped liking me time to disappear   where will you go  what   i said where will you go  a new place if i make

its ready  you should be able to install it in five minutes  like you said geordi whats the rush  i have some friends around here i think its time to make a stand  mr okona  captain ive decided not to leave   but im not staying either  what are your plans  ive decided to surrender myself   to which one  theres really only one option  viewer on  gentlemen communicating like this is very distracting  i suggest we beam you up and we resolve this face to face   excellent  agreed  leave your weapons behind keep this civilised  number one take the bridge  counsellor accompany me to deck 14 conference room   worf see to our guests  aye sir  they have no weapons  this way  okona you are without shame  for once i agree with debin you are without shame  i trusted you my son treated you like a brother  and then to steal from us i want him now  no hes coming with me  my complaint was registered first  now please be calm  lieutenant thank you  everyone is talking about me not to me  you all believe that i stole the jewel   and that i fathered the child  you dare call my daughter a liar  now im offered these two choices and given these two options  condemnation as a thief or marriage to the beautiful yanar  i will take the more pleasant sentence   i will take yanar as my wife  no you cant   you cant escape that way  i dont mean that  its not up to you nor to okona  ive been dishonoured i will decide  wait since all of you believe okona is the father then so be it   ill marry you  no you cant  yes i can   okona is still a thief  no hes not  nothing has been stolen  the jewel has been taken into custody by its rightful heir  me i was to give it to yanar as our pledge of marriage  marriage  yanar is carrying my child  you said it was okonas  if id told you it was benzan  you would have gone to war with his father   i let you think it was okona  see how i get a reputation  if i had said i was giving the jewel to yanar   youd have disowned me  now were hearing truth  so you let me chase okona when you knew he was innocent  yes i didnt think for one moment that you could catch him  he never would have  once yanar accepted the jewel the marriage would have been made   well i never got it  then okona does have the jewel  i never had the chance to deliver it  anyway its too late i wont marry benzan   then youll marry okona  i wont marry anyone  i have reinstated the same
