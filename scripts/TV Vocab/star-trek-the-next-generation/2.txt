                space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  captains log stardate 411537  our destination is planet deneb iv  beyond which lies the great unexplored mass of the galaxy  as you ordered sir  my orders are to examine farpoint  a starbase built by the inhabitants of that world  meanwhile im becoming better acquainted with my new command  this galaxyclass uss enterprise  i am still somewhat in awe of its size and complexity  as for my crew were short in several key positions  most notably a first officer  but im informed an experienced man cmdr william riker  will be waiting to join the ship at our deneb iv destination  you will agree data that starfleets orders are difficult  difficult simply solve the mystery of farpoint station  as simple as that  farpoint station even the name sounds mysterious  its hardly simple to negotiate an agreement to use the base  and at the same time snoop around finding out why it was built  inquiry the word snoop  how can you be programmed as an encyclopedia of human information  without knowing a simple word like snoop  possibility a human behavior i was not designed to emulate  it means  to spy to sneak  to seek covertly to go stealthily to slink slither   exactly  glide creep pussyfoot gumshoe  captain  im sensing a  a powerful mind  something strange on the detector circuit  it registers as solid  or a powerful force field if we collide with either  shut off that damn noise go to yellow alert  shields and deflectors up sir   reverse power full stop  controls to full stop sir  reading full stop sir  thou art notified that thy kind  hath infiltrated the galaxy too far already  thou art directed to return to thine own solar system  thats quite a directive  would you mind identifying what you are  we call ourselves the q  or thou mayst call me that its all much the same thing  i present myself as a fellow ship captain  that thou mayst better understand me  go back whence thou camest stay where thou art   data call medics  hes frozen  he would not have injured you recognize this stun setting  knowing humans as thou dost would thou be captured helpless by them  now go back or thou shalt most certainly die  captains log supplementary  the frozen form of lt torres has been rushed to sickbay  the question now is the incredible power of the q being  do we dare oppose it  captain thy little centuries go by so rapidly  perhaps thou will better understand this  actually the issue at stake is patriotism  return home and end the commies all it takes are a few good men  what that nonsense is centuries behind us  you cant deny youre still a dangerous savage child race  most certainly i deny it  i agree we still were when humans wore costumes like that   when you slaughtered millions in arguments  about how to divide the resources of your little world  each other over tribal god images  there are no indications humans will change  even when we wore costumes like that wed started to make rapid progress  yeah want to review your rapid progress  rapid progress  to where humans learn to control their military with drugs  sir sickbay reports lt torress condition is better  concern for ones fellow comrade how touching  a personal request permission to clean up the bridge  lt worf is right as security chief i cant let  yes you can lt yar  better and later on finally reaching deep space  humans found enemies to fight out there too  to broaden those struggles you again found allies for more murdering  the same old story all over again  no the same old story is the one were meeting now  selfrighteous life forms who are eager not to learn but to prosecute  to judge anything they cant understand or tolerate  an interesting idea prosecute and judge  i suppose it turns out we understand you humans only too well  we dont fear what the true facts about us will reveal  facts about you splendid youre a veritable fountain of good ideas  there are preparations to make  when we next meet captain well proceed exactly as you suggest  sir respectfully submit our only choice is to fight   fight or try to escape  sense anything commander  its mind is much too powerful recommend we avoid contact  from this point no station aboard  will make use of transmitted signals or intercom  well try and take them by surprise  lets see what this starship can do  inform engine room to prepare for maximum acceleration   aye sir  record search data  results of detaching saucer at highwarp velocity  inadvisable at any warp speed sir  search theoretical  it is possible but absolutely no margin for error  using printout notify all decks to prepare for maximum acceleration  maximum means pushing our engines well beyond safety limits  our hope is to surprise whatever that is out there  try and outrun it  our only other option  is to tuck tail between our legs and return to earth as they demand  engine room ready sir  the board shows green all go  stand by  engage  velocity warp 92   heading 351 mark 11  steady on that  the hostile is chasing accelerating fast  were now at warp 93 which takes us past the red line  continue accelerating  counselor at this point im open to guesses about what we just met  it felt like something beyond what we consider a life form  beyond  very very advanced sir or certainly very very different  were at 94 sir   hostile is beginning to overtake  are you sure  hostiles velocity is warp 96 shall i put them on the main viewer  reverse angle  magnifying viewer image  hostiles velocity is 97 sir  inform the engine room we need more  attempting to comply but  yellow alert have photon torpedoes on ready status  torpedoes to ready  hostile now at warp 98 sir  our velocity is only 95  projection sir we may be able to match hostiles 98  but at extreme risk  now reading the hostile at warp 99  now hear this printout message urgent  all stations on all decks prepare for emergency saucer sever  command the saucer section lieutenant  i am a klingon to seek escape when my captain goes into battle  you are a starfleet officer lieutenant  aye sir  make the mark data  note in ships log that at this startime  im transferring command to the battle bridge  captains log stardate 411537  preparing to detach saucer section  so families and most of the ships company  can seek relative safety while the stardrive  with the battle bridge and armaments  will turn back and confront the mystery that is threatening us  torpedoes must detonate close enough to the hostile  to blind it when we separate  understood sir   all decks acknowledging  worf this is the captain  at separation we will reverse power just enough  to get your saucer out and clear  understood  torpedoes away sir  begin countdown mark  starship separation in six  five four three  two one  separation is successful sir  torpedoes have detonated sir  lets come to a stop reverse power  reverse power decelerating  dead stop  well hold this position and wait for them  that will bring them here in just minutes   will we make a fight of it  lieutenant  you recommend that we fight a life form that can do all that  id like to hear your advice  i spoke before i thought  we should distract them from going after the saucer  all forward motion stopped sir  thank you conn  commander signal the following in all languages and on all frequencies  we surrender  state that we are not asking for any terms or conditions  aye sir  all language forms and frequencies  the prisoners will all stand  historically intriguing captain  very accurate  mid21st century the postatomic horror  all present  stand and make respectful attention to honored judge  careful sir this is not an illusion or a dream  but these courts belong in the past  i dont understand either but this is real  get to your feet criminals  at least were acquainted with the judge  attention  on your feet attention  you are out of order  the prisoners will not be harmed  until theyre found guilty  dispose of that  can we assume this will be a fair trial  yes absolutely equitable  before this gracious court now appear these prisoners  to answer for the multiple and grievous savageries of the species  how plead you criminal  if i may captain  objection in the year 2036 the new united nations declared  no earth citizen could be made to answer  for the crimes of his race or forbears  objection denied this is a court of the year 2079  by which time more rapid progress  had caused all united earth nonsense to be abolished   tasha no  i must  i grew up in a world that allowed things like this court  it was people like these that saved me from it  this socalled court should get down on its knees to what starfleet is  what it represents  you barbarian   this woman  criminals keep silent  you have a lot to learn if you think you can torture us into silence  will she live  uncertain when he froze torres sickbay helped thaw him out  you will answer the charges criminal  for what for this  her death or worse  you promised the prisoners will not be harmed  we plead nothing if you break your own rules  i suggest you centre your attention on this trial   it may be your only hope  youre having second thoughts  if you conduct a fair trial which was your promise you may lose  lose  yes even as judge and prosecutor  and jury  accepted so long as you keep to your agreement  assaulting a prisoner isnt a fair trial  this is a merciful court  silence  to continue i must caution you that legal trickery is not permitted   this is a court of  a court of fact  we humans know our past even when were ashamed of it  i recognize this court system as the one that agreed  with the line from shakespeare kill all the lawyers  which was done  leading to the rule guilty until proven innocent  bringing the innocent to trial would be unfair  you will answer to the charge of being a grievously savage race  grievously savage could mean anything  i will answer only specific charges  are you certain you want a full disclosure of human ugliness  so be it fool  present the charges  criminal you will read the charges to the court  i see no charges against us your honor  you are out of order  soldiers you will press those triggers  if this criminal answers with any word other than guilty  criminal how plead you  guilty  provisionally  the court will hear the provision  we question whether you are abiding by your own instructions  may cmdr data repeat the record   no legal trickery  these will be your own words  what followed the statement that prisoners will not be harmed  yes sir  the captain asked the question  can we assume this will be a fair trial  and in reply the judge stated  yes absolutely equitable  irrelevant testimony entirely irrelevant  alright  we agree there is evidence to support the contention  that humans have been savage  so i say test us test whether this is presently true of humans  i see you petition the court to accept you and your comrades  as proof of what humanity has become  there must be many ways to test us we have a long mission ahead  another brilliant suggestion  but your test hardly requires a long mission  your immediate destination offers more challenge  than you can possibly imagine  yes this farpoint station will be an excellent test  all present respectfully stand  this court is adjourned to allow the criminals to be tested  this honorable court is adjourned  stand respectfully  captain you may find that youre not nearly clever enough  to deal with what lies ahead for you  it may have been better to accept sentence here  what is present course conn  what its been all along sir direct heading to farpoint station  confirm we are on that heading sir  know anything about farpoint sir sounds a fairly dull place  weve heard that we may find it rather interesting  personal log cmdr william riker  stardate 411537  the uss hood has dropped me off at farpoint station  i await the arrival of the new uss enterprise  to which ive been assigned as first officer  meanwhile ive been asked to the administrators office  in the old city  cmdr riker weve still no word from your vessel  i trust we made your waiting comfortable   luxurious is more like it  good  is it ungrateful to ask for information  anything  fascinating the advanced materials used to construct this station  your energy surplus must be abundant  geothermal energy is a great blessing of this planet  ill send details to your quarters  thank you but it still seems incredible to me  that you constructed this station so rapidly and so  so perfectly suited to our needs  would you care for an earth delicacy commander  if theres an apple  im sorry commander  it doesnt matter i was saying   ill be damned  yes  there was another selection here  groppler i could swear this wasnt here a minute ago  did your failure to notice it make it unwelcome  not at all  i trust it will be the same with farpoint station  a few easily answered questions about it  wont make starfleet appreciate it less  and its delicious thank you  good morning groppler zorn  you have been told not to do that  why cant you understand  it will arouse their suspicion  and if that happens we will have to punish you  we will i promise you  dr crusher  mother its cmdr riker   hello wes enjoying farpoint  yes sir   can i join you for a stroll  we were about to go shopping   ive wanted to visit the mall  of course  if youre wondering about mom shes not unfriendly  shes just shy with men she doesnt know  wesley that means hed like us to be friends  im willing although were not officially part of the enterprise  we can do something useful while we wait  useful how  investigating some things ive noticed here  gold would be lovely with this  i am sure there are reasons for a first officer  to demonstrate energy and alertness to a new captain  but my duty and interests are outside the command structure  its remarkable they had exactly what you asked for  thank you ill take the entire bolt  send it to our starship when it arrives charge to dr crusher  lets see where were we  i accused you of currying favor with our captain i apologize  mom that gold pattern wasnt there  maybe jeanluc would like this looked into  jeanluc picard you know the captain  when i was little he brought my fathers body home to us  yes wes long ago  a pleasure to meet you commander excuse us  my pleasure doctor   wes  sir  see you on board  yes sir  sir the enterprise is arriving  is this an official report  sorry lt la forge reporting  the enterprise arriving but without the saucer sir   what happened  i dont know  capt picard wants you to beam up  our new captain doesnt waste time its a good idea   thank you lieutenant  aye sir  enterprise this is cmdr riker at farpoint station  standing by to beam up  lt yar of security sir  capt picard will see you on the battle bridge  with no saucer i assume something interesting happened  battle bridge thats for the captain to explain sir  do we have clearance   aye sir standard parking orbit  make it so  cmdr riker sir  riker wt reporting as ordered sir   is the viewer ready  all set up sir  well bring you up to date on our little adventure then well talk  welcome aboard  this way sir  thou art directed to return to thine own solar system  go back or thou shalt most certainly die  you cant deny youre still a dangerous savage child race  message from the saucer module sir it will arrive here in 51 minutes  inform them well connect when they arrive  send the commander to me when hes finished  each other over tribal god images  there are no indications that humans will change  there are preparations to make  when we next meet captain well proceed exactly as you suggest  he calls that a little adventure  come  not exactly a runofthemill happening  it seems were alive only because we have been placed on probation  a very serious kind of probation  go  the saucer module now entering orbit with us sir  acknowledge  cmdr riker will conduct a manual docking picard out  sir  you reported in you are qualified   yes sir  then i mean now commander  they say you will be doing this manually sir   no automation  as ordered  velocity to one halfmeter per second  adjust pitch angle negative three degrees  watch your roll angle conn  all stations prepare for reconnection  thrusters to station keeping all velocity zero  her inertia should do the job  lock up now  a routine maneuver but you handled it quite well  thank you sir i hope i showed some promise  i have some questions for you  i thought you might  i see in your file that capt desoto thinks very highly of you  one curious thing you refused to let him beam down to altair iii  in my opinion it was too dangerous to risk exposing the captain  i see a captains rank means nothing to you  rather the reverse but a captains life means a great deal more to me  isnt it just possible that you dont get to be a starfleet captain  without knowing whether its safe to beam down or not  isnt it presumptuous of a first officer  to secondguess his captains judgment  permission to speak candidly sir  always  having been a first officer yourself  you know that assuming that responsibility  must include the safety of the captain  i have no problem following your rules  short of compromising your safety  you wont back off from that position  no sir  one further thing   a special favor  anything sir  using the same strength you showed with desoto  can you keep me from making an ass of myself with children   sir  im not a family man  and yet starfleet has given me a ship with children aboard   yes sir  and i  i dont feel comfortable with children  but since a captain needs an image of geniality  youre to see thats what i project  aye sir  welcome to the enterprise cmdr riker  ive heard of your case the visor you wear  is a remarkable piece of bioelectronic engineering  by which i see much of the em spectrum  ranging from heat and infrared through radio waves et cetera  and forgive me if ive said and listened to this a thousand times   youve been blind all your life  i was born this way  you always had pain from using this  they say its because i use my natural sensors in different ways  i see two choices  the first is painkillers  which affect how this works  no and choice number two  exploratory surgery desensitize the brain areas troubling you  same difference  no thank you doctor  i understand  see you   yes sir  where will i find cmdr data  cmdr data is on special assignment  using our shuttle to transfer an admiral to the hood   an admiral  hes been checking medical layout  why a shuttle why not beam over  i suppose he could but the admirals a rather remarkable man  have you got some reason you want my atoms scattered all over space boy  no sir but at your age why put up with the trouble of a shuttle craft   hold it right there boy  sir  what about my age   if that subject troubles you  troubles me  whats so damn troublesome about not having died  how old do you think i am anyway  according to starfleet records  explain how you remember that so exactly  i remember every fact im exposed to sir  i dont see no points on your ears boy but you sound like a vulcan  no sir im an android  almost as bad  i thought it was accepted  that vulcans are an advanced and most honorable race  they are  and damn annoying at times  yes sir  well this is a new ship but shes got the right name   you remember that you hear  i will sir  you treat her like a lady  and shell always bring you home  did you signal the hood  your exact message bon voyage mon ami  what was the reply computer  youre wasting time captain or did you think i was gone  lieutenant do you intend to blast a hole in the viewer  if the purpose of this is to test humans  your honor we must proceed in our own way  you are dilatory you have 24 hours  any further delay and you risk summary judgment against you   sorry sir  you reacted fast mr worf  but futilely  i will learn to do better sir  of course you will weve a long voyage ahead of us  what do we do if theyre monitoring our every move and word  we do exactly what we would if this q never existed  if were going to be damned lets be damned for what we really are  personal log stardate 411538  of the 24 hours q allotted us to prove ourselves  without incident  and yet i cannot forget qs prediction  that we will face some critical test  this planets interior heat provides an abundance of geothermal energy  and this is what made it possible for them  to construct this base to starfleet standards  yes they must have been trading surplus energy  for the construction materials used here  many of the materials are not found on this world  its like those incidents you describe in your report  as almost magical attempts to please us  those events did happen sir  none of it suggests anything threatening  if only every life form had as much desire to please  ready to beam down i look forward to meeting this groppler zorn  i have a feeling theres more to it than trying to please us  as if its something q is doing to trick us  over here ive asked the counselor to join us in this meeting  may i introduce our new first officer cmdr william riker  riker ships counselor deanna troi  do you remember what i taught you imzadi  can you still sense my thoughts  a pleasure commander  likewise counselor  have the two of you met before  we have sir  excellent  i consider it important for my key officers  to know each others abilities  we do sir  we do  i too could never say goodbye imzadi  we need more information  before we can make recommendations to starfleet  no objections to that  but im puzzled over you bringing a betazoid to this meeting  if her purpose sir is to probe my thoughts  i can sense only strong emotions groppler  im only half betazoid my father was a starfleet officer  well i have nothing to hide of course  good since we admire what weve seen of your construction techniques  starfleet may be interested in your constructing starbases elsewhere  we are not interested in building other facilities  if i may captain  then a trade some things that you need  in return for lending us engineers who can demonstrate your techniques  bandi do not enjoy leaving their homeworld  if starfleet cannot accept that small weakness  then we will be forced unhappily  to seek an alliance with someone like the ferengi  counselor what is it  do you want it described here  yes no secrets here if were to be all friends agreed  we ourselves have nothing to hide  pain  loneliness  terrible loneliness  despair  im not sensing groppler or any of his people  but its something very close to us here  the source of this groppler have you any idea  no no absolutely not  and i find nothing helpful or productive in any of this  and thats it no other comment  what do you expect of us we offer you a base designed to your needs  luxurious by even human standards  while evading our simplest questions about it  well adjourn for now  while we all reconsider our positions  the ferengi would be very interested in a base like this  fine lets hope they find you as tasty as their past associates  ensign could you help me find cmdr data  hes somewhere on this deck  this way you must be new to these galaxyclass starships  tell me the location of cmdr data  lt cmdr data now located in holodeck area 4j  and as you can see its pointing you that way   thank you  youre welcome  the next hatchway on your right  thank you  youre welcome cmdr riker and if you care to enter  i do  hello  marvelous  how easily humans do that  i still need much practice  theres some puzzles down on the  down on the planet that the captain wants answered  he suggests that i take you with me  i shall endeavor to function adequately  yes  when the captain suggested you i looked up your record  a wise procedure sir  your rank of lieutenant commander is honorary  no starfleet class of 78 honors in probability and mechanics  your file says youre a  machine correct does that trouble you  to be honest yes a little  understood sir prejudice is very human  that does trouble me do you consider yourself superior to us  i am superior in many ways  but i would gladly give it up to be human  nice to meet you pinocchio  a joke  intriguing  youll be an interesting companion  this woodland pattern is quite popular  because it duplicates earth so well  coming here almost makes me feel human  these simulations seem so real  much of it is if the transporters can convert our bodies  to an energy beam and then back  yes rocks and vegetation have simpler patterns  correct sir   the rear wall  i cant see it  were right next to it  incredible  cmdr riker isnt this great  this is one of the simple patterns  theyve got thousands more some you cant believe  careful the next rock is loose  wesley  wow  mr data has agreed to join me on the away team  very good  maybe i should get something to wipe this water up  good idea  theres a lowgravity gymnasium too  itd be hard to get bored on this ship  good  mom could you get me a look at the bridge   thats against captains orders  are you afraid of him too  i certainly am not  but capt picard is a pain isnt he  your father liked him very much great explorers are often lonely  no chance to have a family  just a look at the bridge ill stay in the lift when the doors open  you are asking for trouble wes  well see what we can do  someone could begin by examining the underside of the station  our sensors do show some passages   perhaps you and i  tasha you and the counselor  and geordi i want your eyes down there  you and i will start topside  noticed anything unusual  i cant see as well as geordi but the material seems ordinary   construction records  almost identical to starfleets  team leader  weve found something interesting  were in a passageway directly under the station  these walls are something ive never seen before   how are you examining them  in every way  microscopically thermally electromagnetically   none of it is familiar  what about you troi  ive avoided opening my mind  whatever i felt in gropplers office became very uncomfortable  im sorry you must we need more information  pain  such pain  im coming enterprise lock us on to her signal  im sorry close your mind to the pain  unhappiness  terrible despair  who  i dont know  no life form anything like us  what in the hell kind of place is this   geordi what do you see  well its of  its of no material i recognize or have even heard of  what the hell  children are not allowed on the bridge  permission to report to the captain   dr crusher  captain  sir my son is not on the bridge he accompanied me on the turbolift   your son  his names wesley  you last saw him years ago when  well  as long as hes here  i  i knew  i knew your father  want to look around  but dont touch anything  try it out  the panel on your right is for log entries  library computer access retrieval screen control and intercom here  the backup ops panels plus shield and armory controls  the forward viewscreen is controlled from the ops position  highresolution multispectro sensors  how do you know that  perimeter alert  im sorry  get off the bridge both of you   you have a perimeter alert  as my son tried to tell you  picard go ahead  sensors have detected a vessel approaching this planet  no ship is scheduled at this time  have riker and his team beam back up  security is it the hood returning  it does not match the hoods configuration  put it on main viewer identification  vessel unknown configuration unknown  hail it  weve been trying no response   raise shields phasers at ready  shields up sir phasers ready  get me groppler zorn  continue greetings on all frequencies  this is zorn captain  an unidentified vessel has entered orbit with us  do you know who it is  no ships are scheduled to arrive until  i asked you if you knew who it is you mentioned the ferengi alliance  but weve had no dealings with them  it was only a a thought   are you certain  i promise you  we were making an empty threat i wanted your cooperation forgive me  entering orbital trajectory  it measures 12 times our volume  sensors say we were just scanned  pain again   youve been at it enough  no  i feel close to an answer of some kind  something down here is shielding our communicators  yes thats the feeling ive been reading  as if someone doesnt want us to be in touch with our ship  lets get to the surface  there is no computer record of any such vessel sir  nothing even close  no response weve done everything but threaten them  sensor scans mr worf  our sensor signals just seem to bounce off  somethings happening sir   theyre firing on farpoint  photon torpedoes to ready  theyre hitting the bandi city not farpoint station   those stairs are where we entered  here it becomes ordinary stone   god was that a phaser blast  negative but something similar  you tasha geordi beam up to the ship  i wanna see whats happening  dont lf you should be hurt  you have your orders lieutenant carry them out  yes im sorry sir  enterprise three to beam up  enterprise enterprise come in  help us please  what shall we do  enterprise help us please  tune that down cmdr riker come in can you hear me  riker to enterprise come in  cmdr riker come in where are you  with data on the edge of the old city  its being hit hard sir  farpoint station any damage there  negative on damage to farpoint  theyre avoiding hitting the station  its from an unidentified vessel thats entered orbit  no id no answer to our signals  the old bandi citys being hit hard   many casualties very probable  understand commander  would you object to your captain ordering an illegal kidnapping  no objection sir  groppler zorn may have the answers we need bring him here  aye sir  theyre forcing a difficult decision on me  protecting the bandi wont violate the prime directive  true they are not allies but  we are in the midst of diplomatic discussions with them  lieutenant lock phasers on that vessel  phasers locked on  typical so typical  savage life forms never follow even their own rules  get off my bridge  interesting that order about phasers  standing by on phasers  dont let me interfere use your weapons  weve no idea who is on that vessel my order was a safety precaution  really no idea what it represents  the meaning of that vessel is as plain  as the noses on your ugly little primate faces  and if you were truly civilized  wouldnt you be doing something about the casualties down there  captain to cmo are you reading any of this  medical team preparing to beam down  compliments on that doctor  any questions  starfleet people are trained to render aid   but not trained in clear thinking  lets consider your thoughts  you call us savages yet you knew those people would be killed  it is your conduct that is uncivilized  theyre firing on the planet again  go to maneuvering jets position us between that vessel and the planet   force fields full on  aye sir  impulse power to  we have no ship control sir  its gone  are you undamaged  yes you  all systems operating  please make it stop  you can drive it away  drive who away   i dont know  unlikely  our records show you supervised all bandi contact with other worlds  weve done nothing wrong  if we can learn nothing from you well leave  no oh no please dont leave  ill try to explain  first officer to enterprise  weve lost zorn  something like a transporter beam has snatched him away  question sir could it be this q  none of you knows who transported him  youre running out of time  captain suddenly im sensing something else  satisfaction   enormous satisfaction  from the same source as before  no that was on the planet this is much closer  excellent counselor hes such a dullard isnt he  captain from transporter room riker and data have beamed aboard  excellent with more little minds helping  that is enough  we have an agreement  which you are breaking by taking over our vessel  interfering with my decisions   either leave or finish us  temper temper mon capitaine  im merely trying to assist a pitiful species  i will leave if riker provides me with some amusement  do nothing that he asks  but i ask so little and its so necessary if youre to solve this  beam over there with your what is it your away team  ill risk no one on that unknown  you should know what youll find perhaps its too adult a puzzle  with all respect captain i want to beam over there  you show promise my good fellow  have you understood any part of what hes tried to tell you  humanity is no longer a savage race  but you must still prove that  you impressed him number one thats hopeful  thank you  if hes not open to evidence in our favor  where will you go from there   ill attend to my duty  to the bitter end  i see nothing so bitter about that  can i help you  i  i didnt want you thinking me harsh   coldblooded  why would i ever think that  i didnt welcome you aboard personally professionally  i made you come to me on the bridge i yelled at your son  who as you pointed out was quite correct  he seems to have a very good grasp of starship operations  youve just won this mothers heart  but now your assignment here  i would consider and approve  a transfer for you  you consider me unqualified  hardly your service record shows youre just the cmo i want   then you object to me personally  im thinking of your feelings  for you to work with a commanding officer  who would continually remind you of a terrible personal tragedy  if i had had any objections  i wouldnt have requested this assignment  you requested this posting  my feelings about my husbands death  wont affect the way i serve you or this mission  then welcome aboard doctor  riker to picard were ready to beam over  i hope we can be friends  thank you  phasers on stun  energize  most interesting sir  its the same construction we saw in the underground tunnel  but no sound of power  no equipment  how does this ship run  what is it  is it the same as you felt down there  no  this is much more powerful  full of anger  hate   toward us  no  its directed down towards the old bandi city  most intriguing again  the place this vessel was firing upon was not the farpoint starbase  but the home of those who constructed  sorry sir  i seem to be commenting on everything  good  dont stop my friend  enterprise riker  this is turning out to be a very long tunnel or corridor  no ships crew in sight  no sign of mechanism or circuitry  no controls or readouts  this is nothing like any vessel ive seen before  groppler zorn sir  a great fear just ahead  theres a different feeling here than in the tunnel  very different  no please no more please  make it stop please  please make it stop  no please no more   please  zorn can you hear me  the pain   no  has the alien communicated  please   please no more  thats it sir  its just one alien im sensing here  please i dont understand what you want  not true he does know  no  dont  transporter chief yank them back now  riker acknowledge  your time is up captain  transporter chief do you have their coordinates   he cant hear you  transporter chief come in  i have people in trouble over there q  everyone at ease thats an order  q my people are in trouble  let me help them please  ill do whatever you say  youll do whatever i say  it seems i did make that bargain  the agreement isnt valid it wasnt q that saved us  save yourself it may attack you now  it was that which sent us back  it is not merely a vessel somehow it is alive  she lies destroy it make phasers and photon torpedoes ready   no do nothing he demands  that thing was killing my people   was there a reason  its an unknown isnt that enough  if youd earned that uniform  youd know its the unknown that brings us here  a wasted

use other life forms for your recreation  if so youve not provided the best  leave us weve passed your little test  temper temper mon capitaine   get off my ship  i do so only because it suits me  but i will not promise never to appear again  captains log stardate 411742  the agreement for rebuilding farpoint station  has been completed per my instructions   all stations  ready for departure sir
