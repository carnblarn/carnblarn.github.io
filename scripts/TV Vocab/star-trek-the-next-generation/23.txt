                captains log stardate 416979  were en route to sarona viii for shore leave  the entire crew is looking forward to it  on a personal note i have allowed myself the luxury of a head start  i took advantage  no no lieutenant the advantage was yours  come again  en garde  interesting move but what technique was that  the technique of a desperate man  interesting move but what technique was that  the technique of a desperate man  captain what was that   picard to bridge  captain  number one did something unusual just occur on the bridge  yes we experienced some kind of loop where everything repeats itself  here too im on my way   report mr data  sensors show nothing sir  but it appears a moment in time repeated itself exactly for everyone   just like dj vu  reports coming in from all decks  computers were also affected  the phenomenon was not an illusion but occurred in real time  number one find out if anything similar happened in this sector  i am receiving an emergency transmission  from the pegos minor system  put it on  5422  i repeat this is dr paul manheim we are in need of help urgent  all ships please respond i repeat  coordinates are 667289  by 7075  it is an automated signal i cannot establish contact   this is dr paul manheim  shut it off  lay in a course on those coordinates  you act as if theres a connection  between the time distortion and the signal  there is  paul manheim  he went off to work on experiments  relating to nonlinear time  it appears he has achieved some success   speed warp eight  aye sir  engage  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  estimated arrival pegos minor four hours 35 minutes 17 seconds   ive never heard of paul manheim  mr data  a highly respected scientist considered a visionary  he had timerelated theories  one regarding time and gravity was intriguing  but none of his theories received wide acceptance  scientists to expand that research  they disappeared havent been heard from since   did you know him  i knew of him  he was teaching at the university when i was in paris but i  didnt have the pleasure i must change  number one inform me half an hour before we reach those coordinates  try to determine if the time distortion  was specifically located on the enterprise   captain excuse me  yes what is it counselor  i think you would prefer to discuss this in private  thats not necessary go on  when prof manheim was mentioned you reacted with intense emotion  yes please get to the point  i dont want to interfere with your personal life  but unresolved strong emotion can affect judgment  well thank you for your concern  as ships counselor i offer my assistance  what do you suggest  confronting deep personal issues is not easy for you  you tend to suppress them  there are a few hours until we arrive  perhaps you should use this time to analyze your feelings  and put them into perspective  thank you if i should need you further ill let you know  bridge belay that  computer estimated arrival at pegos minor  two hours nine minutes  holodeck three   computer this is capt picard  holodeck three is clear  location paris caf des artistes  as it appeared 22 years ago  april 9th 1500 hours three oclock  warm spring day  program complete  monsieur welcome to the caf des artistes   is this your first time in paris  no  this way  that table  mais bien sur monsieur we are here to please you  ive been away far too long  some wine some cheese  im not very hungry i really came for the view  perhaps what you hunger for is not on the menu  perhaps not  it was many years ago i had a rendezvous  i was to meet someone  someone here at that very table  your young lady she did not come  actually i dont know i always imagined that she did  you however did not  well trust edouard  i will bring something very special just for you  lets go weve waited long enough  fine you go ill stay a little longer  hes not coming gabrielle  no after last night i know he will  then he would be here  you are making a fool of yourself and i will not watch   do we know each other  no  do i remind you of someone  no  yes you do somewhat  hes not coming  why what did i do to drive him away  maybe you did nothing maybe he had no choice  maybe he was afraid  of what of me  of being connected rooted  perhaps if hes as young as you are he doesnt know what he wants to do  maybe  enough of this selfindulgence exit  we received communication from the lalo  and from a farming colony on coltar iv  both described the time distortion  the captain of the lalo called it a hiccup   hiccup  that may be an incorrect analogy  how so  a hiccup is an inhalation with closure of the glottis  accompanied by a peculiar sound  if we use the analogy of a body function what occurred  enough data have you learned any more about the manheim project  only what you already know manheim was concentrating on timegravity  captain weve reached the coordinates specified   theres nothing here  im receiving new coordinates  its a relay signal same source as before  what are they   very remote area sir in the vandor system a binarystar system  main stars a bclass giant the companion stars a pulsar  set course for the new coordinates  why is he making it this difficult to find him  hopefully hell tell us number one  we have reached the coordinates  sensors indicate it is vandor iv  a planetoid in elliptical orbit around a binary system   standard orbit mr la forge  aye sir  give me a visual  viewscreen on theres a small force field on the planet  latitude 20 degrees nine minutes north  longitude 40 degrees two minutes east of the present terminator   penetrable  no sir   open hailing frequencies  frequencies open sir  this is captain this is the captain of the uss enterprise  responding to your call for help  thank you for hearing us where are you  were in orbit around vandor now  you can help me i dont know what to do  its only the two of us left hes having convulsions please  can you lock on to her coordinates  no the force field is preventing any contact other than audio   there is a force field  i know  good but it is preventing us from helping you  you must find some way to shut it down  ill try  force field is off  good lock on to their coordinates beam them to sickbay  dr crusher prepare for a medical emergency two to beam up   well be ready  thats where ill be  ill help  easy  ive got his legs   how long has he been like this  several hours at least  he was in his lab so im not sure  i need to do some tests  i thought the voice sounded familiar  hello  i should have known  who else would have charged to my rescue  this is my first officer cmdr william riker  lt cmdr data  this is jenice manheim   a pleasure mrs manheim  thank you  i have a number of questions for you  i hope i can be of some help  why dont we sit down here  what happened to the rest of the crew  they were working at the second lab  something happened there a few weeks ago they were all killed  it was a terrible accident i dont know what happened  so many brilliant wonderful minds just gone  do you know the nature of dr manheims work  pauls interested in time  hes never believed that it was immutable any more than space is  he came to believe that we reside in one of infinite dimensions  and what holds us here is the constancy of time  change that and it would open the window to those other dimensions  which begins to explain what happened  have you experienced something up here  yes what is emanating here  is having repercussions light years away maybe even further  that would explain his anxiety  i had no idea it had gone so far beyond vandor  why this place why vandor  paul and the team searched for two years to find it  vandors exactly what they needed a planetoid around a binary star  because of the pulsars gravity  did your husband ever attempt to define these dimensions   to show you what he expected  no  but he did say that he was very close to proving his theories  and then the accident  did he anticipate that these experiments might be dangerous  i didnt think so  but now in retrospect he probably did  that would explain the unusual precautions he began taking  even before the accident  the force field the elaborate security system  when he started a new experiment  he insisted i stay in what he called a protected room  thats why you werent affected  he would never knowingly do anything to hurt anyone  yes i believe that  but as he saw his goal getting closer seeming possible  he became more obsessive  maybe that clouded his judgment  this is not how i imagined seeing you again  nor i you  youve done well a great starship on the far reaches of the galaxy  its everything youd hoped  not exactly nothing works just as you hope  if you cant tell us any more i need to send a team to the lab  you cant its protected  one of the scientists made sure no one could get in   excuse me  is he worse  hes resting but you should undergo some tests  my nurse will start them  thank you for your kindness  shes an old friend  i gathered that its her husband im more concerned with   whats the prognosis  i believe hes dying  his neurochemistrys been affected but i dont know how or why   how long does he have  maybe a couple of days  i can only maintain him until i find out whats causing the damage   can we talk to him  not now not yet  incidentally the effects of the time distortions  are now being felt in the ilecom system  bridge  manheim has turned vague theories into a practical application  but without his help i doubt we can pose any intelligent questions  let alone come up with any solutions  incidentally the effects of the time distortions  are now being felt in the ilecom system  its us before we stepped into the turbolift  its happening again  i feel no disorientation  nor do i  what was that  i believe the manheim effect is becoming more pronounced  this is where we started if we are us  we are us but they are also us  indeed we are both us at different points along the same time continuum  bridge   what have you learned  weve scanned the planet sir  the second lab is completely destroyed  unable to determine what caused it little to clarify the situation  sensors show an immense volume of energy within the planet  near manheims remaining laboratory   hows the energy used  no idea   its source  i cannot be sure  but i believe manheim can harness energy from the pulsar  weve learned everything we can from here  and we are no closer to understanding it  manheim is unable to help us but hopefully he kept notes   i need to study the records  well have to go down there  what about the defense system  when the shield was lowered it may have been turned off  if not well deal with it   prepare your team  aye sir   coordinates set  yes sir  energize  theres a lack of integrity  im losing them  bring them back now  whats going on  there seems to be some kind of strange bouncing effect  i cant get them to materialize my readings arent complete  keep trying  why are we back here  youre lucky you made it back at all  where am i  thank god youre on the uss enterprise   they answered your distress signal  i sent one  paul youre going to be fine  no i am not fine im not even close to fine  bridge prof manheim is conscious  it was worth it what happened  what will happen all of it it was all worth it  again its changing again   what is what do you see  im having difficulty  with what are you in pain  i have been on the other side i have touched another dimension  part of me is still there  help him  try to stay calm it wont help you struggling against it  my mind is floating between two places  it is difficult to know which is which  there is no way to explain it  im capt picard  the same one  she has told me about you not all but enough  we need your help the situation is not good   it will get worse  how do we stop it  im having difficulty holding the moment  doctor this is lt cmdr data will you explain the situation to him  i am fully versed on your theories on time and gravity  how is that possible  i am not fully versed on all my theories  i am an android  android on a starfleet vessel   i am the only one  your knowledge is useless  our work has made most of those theories obsolete  then you have harnessed a dynamic energy source  then you do understand yes  we located an energy source in the centre of this planetoid  we learned to enhance it to focus it  everything worked too well  the energy from the pulsar the energy from the planetoid  we opened a crack a window into another dimension  the time distortion we felt  felt then it is not confined to the planetoid  the range is at least several thousand light years  it must be stopped  you must help me to execute a controlled shutdown of my experiment  get my notes theyre in the lab  how do we bypass the security system  ill give you the coordinates to beam safely down to vandor  and the codes you need to bypass security systems to get into my lab  if what the professor has given me is accurate we can repair the damage  but it must be timed to coincide with another time distortion   can we predict it  i believe so  we have to this other dimension will rip into the fabric of the galaxy  reality will not be the same  lt worf i want those codes that manheim gave mr data  rechecked and checked again  no one beams down unless were sure they can get through  aye sir  im sorry for intruding i was told id find you here  youre not intruding were just finished come in  i knew you wouldnt come to me  no not under these circumstances   we have unfinished business  yes we do  why didnt you come to meet me that last day in paris   i was afraid  i didnt want this   what  the truth   you want me to lie  of course  a nice soft painless lie  i got the days confused i thought it was tuesday not wednesday  i went to the caf moulin instead  thats better it was raining you couldnt find a cab  i waited all day  and it was raining it rained the rest of the week  i went to starfleet headquarters but youd already shipped out  so come on  lets hear the truth  it was fear  fear of seeing you losing my resolve  fear of staying losing myself  fear that neither of these choices was right and that  and that either would have  for a long time  not a day went by that i didnt look up into the sky and wonder  each time that i returned to earth my thoughts were filled with you  ive thought a lot about this over the years  perhaps youre leaving out your greatest fear   the real reason you left  which was  that life with me would have somehow made you ordinary  youre wonderful and am i that transparent  only to me  i wish i could talk to you  i bet you were really something  i wanted to see how he was doing  the same  nothing i do seems to make any difference  thats not why youre here  i thought i was the empath   are you alright  why wouldnt i be  i have one of the medical wonders of the galaxy dying in my sickbay  thats not what i meant  i dont want to talk about what i think you mean  i cant compete with a ghost from his past no one could  shes not a ghost shes here right now  she may be in the here and now but its the ghost he sees  excuse me i have to get back to my patient  how soon mr data  if dr manheims information is correct by my calculations  the next time distortion should occur between 28 to 47 minutes  bridge this is sickbay  dr manheim is awake and asking to speak to you captain alone  on my way doctor  you asked for me  i am not sure i remembered all the codes for the security system  you should warn anyone going down there  thank you ill tell them to be cautious  what i really wanted to talk to you about is jenice  i did not come to discuss your wife  it is only this  if anything should go wrong please take care of her for me  of course  she never would admit this  but she has had a terrible time these last years  had we not been so isolated she might have left me  i never would have known at least not right away  perhaps im not a man who should have a woman like her  she deserves better  you underestimate her  i know because i once did  in both cases the time distortions occurred along the same continuum  as a preview or reprise of a specific point in time  where we are were and where we will be  data i want this to be an away team of one you  theres no reason to risk anyone else  it is reasonable sir after all i am a machine and dispensable  indispensable is the appropriate word  but you seem more able to control the effects of the time distortion  i see that is quite true sir  i see time as a constant whereas humans perceive time as flexible  hence the expression time flies when youre having fun  which until now has always confused me  well i want you to put a stitch in time and save much more than nine  sir  if other members of the away team became disoriented  it could create additional problems and perhaps increase the danger  i will go immediately sir  good luck data  alright we have the coordinates exactly as the professor specified  i am proceeding to the lab sir   maintain an open frequency  aye sir  mr data whats going on  dr manheim forgot to mention one of his security precautions sir  i am proceeding into the laboratory  this channel will remain open please continue to report  this appears to be the instrument dr manheim described  it should confirm when the next time effect will occur  do you have enough information to decipher the security code  i will know in a moment sir  according to calculations  the next time effect will occur in one minute 30 seconds  whats the next step  i need to add antimatter to rebalance and align the system  will that plug the hole  theoretically yes in reality i do not know  when the effect hits the force fields will align  opening a clean straight path to the other dimension  whatever the time distortion  i must add the antimatter at the appropriate moment  geordi if the professor was right i need a 27second countdown  you got it  captain i now have the antimatter  and am moving towards the opening at the end of the lab  the next time distortion should occur within seconds  geordi begin countdown on my mark  now   captain there appear to be three of us  should i drop the antimatter or wait for one of you  only one of us is at the correct time continuum  which one  me its me  five four three two one now  data report are you alright   yes sir  is it closed  it is well patched sir  closed means permanent which i cannot guarantee  patched is good enough well done beam back immediately  with pleasure sir  this is amazing all your readings are completely normal   where is my wife  shes right here  the effect has been reversed i can feel it were safe   how is he  he needs rest  there may be residual effects other than that hell be alright  i feel like im coming out of a long tunnel  its there not at all like i thought it would be different   describe it  i cant not yet  the only words that fit are too pale because the images are so vibrant  its not like anything anyone has experienced before  there was no no there is this kind of life  not like us not like this  whats the condition of my lab  intact for the most part  dont tell me were going back  jenice we are so close  we have learned so much to walk away  besides we owe it to the others our friends  there have been so many sacrifices by so many good people   well be going back  yes i can see that  the federation will want to help in any way it can  thank you  this time it will be different i promise  it always is my love  you said my life would never be dull and it never has been  thank you  computer this is troi request access  terminate the current program   no continue the program  enter when ready  the captain is waiting for you inside  hows this possible its paris  unbelievable  madame this way the captain is waiting for you   this is so real  bien sur pourquoi pas  dont tell me how you did it i dont care  its perfect  its as if we were really there  i wanted to say goodbye properly this time  i shall always picture you here  i expect you to always come charging to my rescue  ill do my best  goodbye jeanluc  be well  and you  thank you for paris  well so much for my dramatically romantic exit   is anything wrong  no sir  set course for sarona viii  as i remember we were on our way for muchneeded shore leave   course plotted and laid in sir  warp five  engage  ive been there once theres this club  i dont remember the name they serve blue concoctions  its across the square from the dance palace  its called the blue parrot caf and youre buying
