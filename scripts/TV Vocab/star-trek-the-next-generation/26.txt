                repulse shuttle has cleared docking bay three   open hailing frequencies  hailing frequencies open  this is the enterprise we are getting under way  acknowledged transfer complete good luck on your mission  and to you  give my regards to your captain repulse out  shuttle bay secure  thank you mr crusher make preparations to get under way  were constructing the enclosure on cargo deck five  come  the transfers complete dr pulaski is being shown to her quarters  grand look at the containment module our chief engineer designed  chief engineer it still has a nice ring to it  each unit has total environmental control  gravity temperature atmosphere light in a protective field  these go into the large containment unit  right see these modules will keep the specimens alive  but its the large containment area that will keep us alive  i have to replicate this 512 times  which means i have to divert power from the warp engines   so how long on impulse power  a couple of hours cant be helped  when we leave audet ix im going to need that power  youll have it  number one ill relieve you at 0300  take us out of orbit mr crusher set course for audet ix  aye sir course for audet ix has been input   maximum impulse velocity  aye sir  engage  engineering i have just observed what appeared to be  a random energy transference   where  aft   outboard of the port nacelle  hold on ill check  no i show nothing here data  problem  possibility sir an unexplained power fluctuation   let me know if it reoccurs  aye sir  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilisations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  captains log stardate 42073 1  there is an unclassified plasma plague outbreak  in the rachelis system  we need specimens of the deadly plague  to transport them to science station tango sierra  where hopefully an antidote can be produced   hows it going  ready to insert the modules  number one  lt la forge says we can engage the warp drive within the hour  grand mr data when we have a list of specimens we will carry  i want you and dr   pulaski sir  dr pulaski   go through them  aye sir  where is our new doctor has she reported in  not yet   sickbay this is the captain  sickbay aye   is dr pulaski there  no the doctor is in tenforward   thank you  aye sir  a few hours on board and shes found tenforward   ill go get her  no  ill go  not the best way to meet your new captain  deck ten forward station one  hello captain  ensign  im sorry this mission will delay your reunion with your mother  thats alright it gives me time to finish some projects i have to do  its going to be hard leaving the enterprise  mixed feelings for all of us  its always hard leaving any ship  just as it was for your mother leaving to head starfleet medical  but moving from one assignment to another is part of this life  i know but this isnt any ship  how true   guinan  captain  where is dr pulaski  thank you  you must be capt picard  doctor protocol may have been lax on your last assignment  sit down captain you should hear this  lt la forge status report  the last of the modules are being inserted   warp six as soon as possible  acknowledged  this is dr pulaski well handle the formal introductions later  counsellor deanna troi is pregnant  she is going to have a baby  baby  this is a surprise  more so for me  this pregnancy is unlike any i have ever encountered  since she came to me  i have done two examinations of counsellor troi  this is the first examination  this is halfway through the first trimester about six weeks old  now understand we believe conception took place 11 hours ago  what  it gets better this is the second exam one hour later  its consistent except that the foetus appears several weeks older  at this rate counsellor troi will have her baby in about 36 hours  the normal gestation rate for a betazoid is ten months  i dont mean to be indelicate but whos the father  last night while i slept  something which i can only describe as a presence entered my body  a life form of unknown origin and intent  is breeding right now inside counsellor troi  our purpose here is to determine what is to be done  no wait let me get this straight deanna was impregnated by what  doctor is it a humanoid an alien  its a male human or in this case halfhuman halfbetazoid   exactly the same as deanna  in every way  in fact nothing indicates any genetic patterns other than hers  i dont think this is random i think there is a reason  what i dont know  captain obviously the pregnancy must be terminated  for the safety of the ship and crew  you cant assume the intent was belligerent  that is the safest assumption  captain this is a life form  not to allow it to develop naturally will deny us a study opportunity  if the foetus is aborted laboratory analysis is still possible  doctor is there any health risk to troi if the foetus is aborted  do whatever is necessary to protect the ship and crew  but know this  im going to have this baby  then it seems that the discussion is over  captains log supplemental we have arrived at audet ix  where we will pick up the specimens of plasma plague  because so many lives are at stake  i am willing to put this ship and crew at great risk  meanwhile counsellor trois pregnancy continues to progress  at an astonishing rate  how are you feeling  i should feel uncomfortable with the changes in my body  but i feel fine  better than fine wonderful  standard orbit   open hailing frequencies  hailing frequencies open  this is capt jeanluc picard of the uss enterprise  the enterprise here at last good lets get going  to whom am i speaking  to whom are you speaking lt cmdr hester dealt medical trustee  federation medical collection station  are the specimens ready  yes but i would like to inspect the containment area before we proceed  its not that i doubt the ability of your crew  but we cannot afford a mistake  i appreciate your caution in the like vein  i want a complete detailed manifest  of what you plan to bring on board  very good i will allow you access to my computer banks ok  data crossreference their inventory to the medical computer  number one arrange the transportation  captains log supplemental  its been nearly 14 hours since we arrived at audet ix  but hester dealt has not completed inspection of the containment unit  a transfer will not be permitted until hes assured of zero growth  meanwhile the desperate pleas from the rachelis system continue  captain the final manifest has been received  at last review it with dr pulaski i want you both familiar with it  data will you help me get to sickbay  its time  you bet it is lets get you to maternity  worf assemble a security team in sickbay   is that necessary  yes doctor captains orders  well its strange to need armed guards in a delivery room  this way   how frequent are your contractions  very close  in other deliveries the father is often present   difficult in the circumstances  i could serve in that capacity  counsellor troi needs a human touch not the cold hand of technology  doctor i think cmdr data will do very nicely  your choice  you dont have to do anything data just be with me  theres nothing to be nervous about  nervous i find this very interesting  i understand in technical terms how life is formed  but part of the process eludes me  the child inside you  are you able to access his thought process  does he have thoughts is he aware of you when does awareness begin   its happening  how does it feel   now  now now doctor  this is an impatient baby hes eager to make his appearance  do you want something for the pain it wont diminish the experience  i have felt no pain   none  no none at all  have your security men stand back  i understand you have to be here but keep out from underfoot   foetal position  normal  foetal pulse   the baby shows healthy respiratory movements  the action of the heart rate is good  the babys doing wonderfully troi  breathe slowly  youre doing great stay calm  thats it there it is  ive got him you can relax  there there thats a good boy  hes beautiful  are easy births the norm for betazoids  not according to my mother  you can come in now  theres no threat lieutenant you can relax its just a baby  thank you for letting me participate  it was remarkable   do you have a name  ian andrew after my father   were you here all along  yes  hes beautiful deanna just like his mother  how do you feel  fine  wonderful  thank you doctor for everything  amazing  doctor welcome to the bridge please sit down  how is counsellor troi did she have a good night  ive delivered dozens of babies but none with no pain or trauma   its true  it was effortless for both  im not sure of your point  she had her baby yesterday  if i examined her now i couldnt tell if shed ever had a baby  it was as if the incident never happened  data how long before the transfer  two hours 19 minutes sir   number one take the bridge  aye sir  you will accompany me doctor please  i think its time i paid my respects  come in  i wanted to see how you were and have a look at your  baby my goodness   how old is he  in actuality a day   yes but  in appearance four earth years  ian say hello to capt picard  you mean he can talk  hello  hello ian  please dont worry everything is ok  captains log supplemental we have two major problems  trois child and the deadly cargo were about to take on  in the hours since his birth trois baby has continued his rapid growth  and appears physically and mentally to be a child of eight  still there is no indication as to who he is or why he is here  sickbay we are ready to begin loading  we need a little more time to categorise these specimens  data look at this   dahta  what  my name it is pronounced data  you called me dahta  whats the difference  one is my name the other is not  is this possible  with all your neural nets algorithms and heuristics  does some combination make up a circuit for hurt feelings  possible  i am unfamiliar with this symbol  it indicates a genetically engineered biological life form  about 20 percent of the specimens fall into that category  some eager beaver at play  inquiry  eager beaver  in this case eager beaver refers to some overachieving genetic engineer  who probably because of lack of anything better to do  has forced this strain of virus to mutate  just so we can see how bad bad can get  i want you to know what risks were about to take  go on  if any specimen gets loose  it will destroy all life on the enterprise in a matter of hours  i understand doctor do you have a recommendation  considering how desperately this is needed no i dont  i wanted you to know what we were carrying  thank you  cmdr data you are needed in transporter room three  aye sir excuse me doctor  thats alright dahta data whatever  hes very tactile he wants to touch everything  its time to go sweetheart  unbelievable  i think hes actually grown since you dropped him off   i like it here  i thought you would  thank miss gladstone lets go get something to eat  thank you  biotransport authorisation complete  cargo deck five we will commence transportation on your command  transporter three we are ready to receive  the first batch is in place and were ready for the next  inform me when the cargo is loaded and secure  aye sir  come in  i wanted to see how ian was doing  were doing fine i was about to get his supper  do you want your supper too  no ian but thank you for the invitation  youre welcome   have you ever played with puppies  they had a litter in the nursery  no ian i dont think i have  come to the nursery while the puppies are there  perhaps later  mom  let me see that  thats not so bad  my face is wet  is that better sweetheart everythings going to be fine  he allowed himself to be burned   for the experience  who is he  why is he here what does he want  ian could you tell us why you are here  mommy said it was time to eat  no i mean why are you here on this ship  i live here  the captain wants to know if youre ready to tell us why you came here  no not yet  the answer is within him  when his cognitive powers have developed he will articulate it  i hope thats soon  cargo has been loaded and is secure  then take us out of orbit set a course for rachelis warp six  can i get you something  no nothing i just like to stand here  i dont blame you its beautiful  how about a cup of mareuvian tea  no nothing thank you  youll be leaving soon  what do you see when you look out there  the lorenze cluster  and theres arneb and theres epsilon indi  no i mean when you look out there dont you see your future  itll still be there  what about a cup of nectar direct from prometheus  no nothing  thats the third time youve asked me  its what im expected to do dont you always do whats expected  i try  even if its not what you really want  sometimes  sometimes its more important to consider others before yourself  yes  but sometimes the game is to know when to consider yourself first  give yourself permission to be selfish  somethings wrong   what is it  growth   where  l73  this is cargo deck five  yes la forge  captain we have a malfunction in the containment area   how serious  very  captains log supplemental for reasons as yet unknown  one of the deadly specimens of plasma plague has begun to grow  report mr la forge  captain there is no reason for this to be happening  i cant even isolate the cause  data we better get down there   dr pulaski  yes captain  a difficulty on cargo deck five your presence is requested  im on my way  you never talk about yourself  sure i do all the time  people say youre very old  and that you knew capt picard when he was on the stargazer  no i never knew him till i came on board  everyones very curious about you  i bet they are  yeah they wanna know where youre from  where do they say  well they say that youre from nova kron and   mr crusher to the bridge  aye sir gotta go  thanks  for a dish of delovian souffl  no not for the souffl  i meant for the rest  thats why im here  thanks  bye  why this module and not the others  computer run diagnostic on module l73  all circuits functional  environments as programmed temperature 97 degrees kelvin  radiation flux zero stasis field nominal  everything as it should be right down the line  perhaps it is a sensor malfunction  computer inquiry is growth actually occurring in l73  confirmed   doctor one specimen is growing  destroy it now   i cant  prepare to jettison the module  we cant do that it will remain until it comes into contact  with a planet or another ship  the results would be disastrous  youre saying no matter how bad i think it is its actually worse   this wont hold it  go on  within 30 minutes its going to push out of its module  it will break out of the containment area   no it cant break through this  yes it will  captain we may not be able to get control of this situation  recommend transfer of nonessential personnel to the saucer section  if we lose containment we should prepare to separate  make it so  why this one specimen and none of the others  something is stimulating it do you know how it was developed  yes its right over here  its a mutated strain developed during an outbreak of plasma plague  it was ninth in a series of 58 tests  this particular test was bombarded by low levels of eichner radiation  could exposure to eichner radiation stimulate growth  it could but l  ive got something  why didnt you detect this before  i dont know it wasnt here before  it is now what emits that type of radiation   a subspace phase inverter  we dont have one  certain cyanoacrylates  what else its here we better find it  i feel that some of the people are very worried  i feel it too but dont you worry  its me mommy im the reason   what  its me   you  yes  i have to leave you now or it will be bad for everyone   what are you saying  i have to leave now  leave  youre going to die  no you cant  sickbay this is counsellor troi i need the doctor in my quarters  its ian hurry  what happened did he eat anything did he fall  no  commander the child is the source of the unusual radiation  he said hes why the ship is in danger  that analysis is correct  im losing life signs  you must save him  im sorry  cmdr riker the containment field has stabilised  thank you lieutenant  then ian was right  he was the cause  apparently so  he is a lifeforce entity  when we passed each other in space he was curious about us  he decided the best way to learn  was to go through the process to be born  to live as one of us and in that way to understand us  he never meant any harm  there was a moment when you smiled  he said thank you  i told him we will miss him  and i will   standard orbit mr crusher  aye sir standard orbit  transporter room three this is the captain  lets make this transfer with all deliberate speed  aye sir  ill be glad to be relieved of this cargo  you have the bridge number one  could i see you when youre free   in my ready room  thank you sir   how long will a vaccine take  we may never develop one  all this was in vain   lets hope not  stand by to energise  good luck  data you can lock on to the first group and begin transporting  come  capt picard ive thought about this a lot  i want to remain on the enterprise  have you told your mother  no sir before i do id like your permission to stay  wesley its a little more complicated than that  captain this is where i want to be  this is where i feel i belong  captain transfer complete we are ready to leave orbit  make it so number one  return to your position  all systems secure  take us out of orbit mr crusher set course for morgana quadrant  ensign crusher has requested to remain on the enterprise  im not surprised how did you respond  i havent yet i didnt think it was my responsibility alone  his remaining will create difficulties for us all  yes indeed who will see to his studies  exactly  of course that duty will fall to cmdr data   who will tuck him in at night  come on commander  i will accept that responsibility  well we know hell get his sleep  thats the practical but theres more to growing up than that  number one you are best qualified to supervise that  are you willing to serve  difficult decision  yes i can do that  mr crusher communicate with your mother  tell her you have my permission to remain on the enterprise  but i will abide by her wishes  yes sir thank you sir i know shell agree  if you have course and speed laid in  yes sir they are  then mr crusher engage
