                captains log stardate 417239  following a starfleet order we are in the xendi sabu star system  having rendezvoused with a ferengi vessel which requested a meeting  although we arrived and made appropriate signals three days ago  the ferengi have responded only with the message  stand by enterprise  you sent for me sir  yes doctor sit down  look this perhaps may be nothing  but ive been feeling  a bit odd of late  fatigued and now ive got this damned headache  a what  headache you know what a headache is  of course but i dont often encounter them  the reason is obvious of course what are the ferengi up to  stand by enterprise stand by for what  i dont see a thing wrong  no neither can i unless theyre baiting some kind of trap  with your head  i see nothing physically wrong but ill run some scans in sickbay   all ive got  is an order report to sickbay  from the only person aboard who can give you an order  captain from first officer theyre sending a message  on my way number one  sorry doctor duty calls   theyre prepared to talk sir  have they explained the wait  negative theyve identified their commander as bok daimon bok  you can see him theyre communicating on visual  open hailing frequencies  frequencies open sir  this is capt jeanluc picard of the enterprise  we are transmitting visually  is this the capt picard   do we know each other  i know you picard  then you have the advantage of me is this bok  i am bok daimon of the ferengi  i have asked you here to discuss a mutual problem captain  what problem daimon bok  i insist on speaking of that matter in person  shall we meet on your vessel or mine  hailing frequencies closed  i sense considerable deception on boks part and danger  then we should meet him here keep him under our control  now open sir  i appreciate your offer daimon bok please be our guest here  as you wish picard  perhaps this will begin a new era of cooperation for both our peoples  in one earth hour then  in one hour daimon bok end transmission  i cant believe theyre coming here  they did agree a bit easily  well in one hour we shall know why  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  are you accustomed to getting your own way  only when it makes sense theres 40 minutes until the ferengi beam over  ill have these scans done in ten  a lot of effort for a simple headache  you should not have a headache unless somethings wrong  its true that headaches were once quite common  before the brain was charted before we understood the nature of pain  when we suffered from things such as the common cold   so whats the cause of my headache  i havent the slightest idea  feel better   the pains gone  medical fakery  the pain is actually still there its just cloaked   ill want further exams  doctor  when the ferengi matter is settled  expect an intruder alert  what have you something to report  if youll scan heading 44 mark 163  intruder alert sir  ive got something sir  an oldstyle starship constellation class traveling on impulse power  says who  ensign answer the first officers question  says the longdistance sensors sir i was boosting the sensor output  boosting it how  we will discuss this later  im reading it now as a constellationclass starship  traveling under impulse power sending no call letters  the correct procedure  whats wrong sir  its nothing its just a mild headache  the correct procedure ensign was to signal the bridge immediately   yes sir  bringing it here personally  perhaps to be on hand for the ferengi beamover  might have imperiled us were it something hostile  yes sir  receiving no signal from the approaching starship  time sir  time  for the ferengi beamover  do you see any problem connected with this old starship  its safer to have the ferengi here whatever  concur stand by  hailing frequencies open  welcome in peace daimon bok  it is our pleasure capt picard  might i introduce my first officer kazago and my second rata  this is my first officer cmdr william riker  secondincommand data counselor troi  we have heard that you use females  clothed females most interesting   they are that sir  and the android was mentioned too  what is its price we should like to purchase it  he is not for sale cmdr data is  secondhand merchandise you wouldnt want him  secondhand sir  of course a human joke  excuse me captain the unidentified starship is coming still no signal  think nothing of it it is under our control  one of our starships under your control  do not be alarmed captain  it is a gift from us with which we honor the hero of maxia   who  why you picard of course  do you not remember the battle of maxia  im sorry i do not remember it daimon bok data  he may refer to an encounter nine years ago in the maxia zeta system   an unidentified starship  unidentified  that fine vessel was ferengi  which you destroyed sir  the battle of maxia  i never heard it referred to so dramatically before  my sincere regrets but that vessel refused to identify itself  it simply attacked us we defended ourselves  such mistakes happen in space  hardly a mistake sir your report shows it deliberately attacked  do you want arriving vessel on main viewer its 1000 kilometers away  put it on your viewer  main viewer  there is no one aboard it  the log should be downloaded into the enterprises records  at a price  no price  no price  what is the purpose of this what  i felt something too captain  perhaps it is his conscience  bridge to sickbay  no im fine  it felt as if it were something from your past  its alright im fine  what is this about  it is about the battle i mentioned captain  a gift in honor of that occasion  look at that ship closely   magnify it please lt la forge  aye sir  why  its the stargazer  its my old ship  how did you find it  it was a derelict adrift in space on the far side of this star system  how it got there is none of my business captain  but now that vessel is yours if you wish to have it  we are not selling it to him  consider it an act of friendship  at no cost  ugly very ugly  captains log supplemental  bok and his officers have returned to their vessel  inviting us to take possession of the stargazer   like before  no it hit with more impact  hit im sorry but anything could be important   you felt something yourself  i believe so  like a thought but rather mechanical in nature  sure it wasnt one of my thoughts  at that moment i was remembering being at the helm of the stargazer  a maneuver was being made we were hit  somethings burning  i can smell smoke can you  theres nothing burning jeanluc  that was just part of my memory  memory or nightmare  it was strong whatever it was ready number one  staffs waiting if dr crusher approves  ill do better than that ill go along  we were traveling through the maxia system  an unidentified ship appeared and fired on us pointblank range  where did it come from  it must have been lying in some deep moon crater  first attack damaged the shields in the confusion they hit us again   no clue who they were  no names no reason  can you identify them vigo lf they come a second time  sir whos vigo  my weapons officer on the stargazer  im getting caught up in this  your shields were failing sir  i improvised  with the enemy vessel coming in for the kill  i ordered a sensor bearing when it made the return arc  you performed what starfleet texts now call the picard maneuver  i did what any good helmsman would  dropped into high warp stopped right off the enemys bow and fired  blowing into maximum warp  you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once  our attacker fired on the wrong one  i did what any good helmsman would you did it first sir  it was a saveourskins maneuver  we were finished on fire  we had to abandon ship  we limped through space in shuttles for weeks before we were picked up  i havent thought about this for years  sir the ferengi are waiting for us to take possession of the stargazer   i want to go over to her  i understand sir  as soon as my people make sure shes safe  and after i have another look at you  uss stargazer  constellation class  starfleet registry ncc2893  i activated the emergency power cells amazing they still work  the rest of this ship is clear of surprises lt yar  i read of this ship at the academy i never dreamed id ever be on her  yar to enterprise all clear sir  hello old friend  youll find this most intriguing sir  what did you find data  the last entry dated nine years ago sir by you  we are forced to abandon our starship  may she find her way without us  apparently she did sir   how do you feel captain  im fine doctor  lt yar run a structural analysis on the stargazer for an impulse tow  data download all computers to the enterprise and file  im going to look at my old cabin  try this hero of maxia  captain  another headache this worries me i want you back on the enterprise  but my things  ill see theyre sent to your enterprise quarters  enterprise now taking possession of stargazer kazago  permission granted  it was quite a bargain i thought the ferengi always made a profit  subwarp speed for towing la forge  aye sir  starfleet has answered our request  a tug will meet us and tow the stargazer back to xendi starbase 9  very well data   how was it captain  very strange number one  like going back to the house you grew up in but no ones home   except phantoms of the past  it has troubled you  not half as much as this damned headache  take over number one  aye sir  whats wrong  i wish i could say  shields weakening captain  torpedoes armed  where are they  oh my god sir  fire  what is it data  why all the mystery  the records of the stargazer what the ferengi call the battle of maxia  the captains personal log contains a much different version  of that conflict than the official account  what are you saying  it appears that the starship which capt picard attacked   had been under a flag of truce  what  he destroyed the ship without notice or provocation  what about the fire on the stargazer   an accident in engineering  and what proof  it is logged in his own voice sir  would you care to hear it sir  sir  this is a confession given by me  jeanluc picard commanding uss stargazer   what is this  i dont know sounds like you   it is  i refuse to believe you said that  i must have mistaken their subspace antenna for a weapons cluster  unfortunately i fired our main phasers  and our direct hit destroyed the unknown vessel  i assume they simulated your voice i already put data to work on it  i never made that log entry but it leaves you with a duty to perform  i know sir i must report to starfleet  thats at least one day for communication to reach there  and one more day for their answer to return  id like the truth of this by then id hate to prepare a formal defense   they cant ask for your command  why not  with the ferengi making friendship overtures  id be a severe embarrassment to starfleet  im sure the ferengi are behind the faked log  no wonder theyre waiting out there  headache back sir  damn  ill call the doctor again  its no wonder with all this going on try to relax  this is a confession given by me  jeanluc picard commanding uss stargazer  in the hopes that my belated honesty will be considered by starfleet  when judging my actions during a confrontation  with an unidentified vessel  open hailing frequencies geordi  ill take it in the ready room secure channel  secure sir  starship ferengi this is cmdr riker here  id like to speak to first officer kazago  a problem riker  are our channels secure  it is now  you know the details of the battle of maxia  capt bok has made me aware of it  the infamy of your picard is now known  infamy  id call the wanton destruction of an unarmed vessel infamy  and if i produced evidence  that capt picards log entry was falsified  i hardly imagine you contacted me to discuss an ancient battle   what do you want of me  one question  as you humans say im all ears  first officer to first officer kazago  if your capt bok knew about this  why this peaceful meeting to present the stargazer  we give back your derelict warship and you accuse us of crime riker  i can bear no more insults  yes who the hell is it   not resting captain  more like dying doctor  over here  what is wrong with me  i wish to hell i knew but something unusual is definitely happening  doctors say the obvious like its a revelation  captains always act like theyre immortal  no  you didnt tell me it had been this bad  it wasnt this bad but its getting worse  this should help a little  it must be some emotional pressure connected with the stargazer  i got this headache  long before i even knew my old ship still existed  still perhaps youre partly right  want to talk about it  im here  the fight at maxia i destroyed an entire vessel an entire crew  did you have a choice  i dont know any more i dont know  cmdr riker told me about the altered log  if thats troubling you  the last three nights ive  ive heard these voices  im on the bridge of my old ship  theres fire all around me the klaxons smoke  and then i give the order  and now the stargazer is really here  and that log am i going crazy  was i in my right mind at maxia am i in my right mind now  what was that  something to let you sleep  yes sleep  sleep  shields weakening captain  torpedoes armed  where are they  and now my dear captain you are ready to live the past  where did they come from  phasers sir  what should we do sir  should we fire back  fire captain  you will injure yourself  as you once injured me  sir  damage report  fusion generator under surge control sir power systems failing  sensor beam bearing on hostile ship  seven mark 19 sir  phasers sir  ready phasers and lock  stand by on warp nine  heading sevenseven mark 20  engage  steady  now reverse and stop  phasers fire torpedoes away  fire  by comparing the stargazers main computer log  with capt picards personal log  i found some discrepancies sir  what does that mean  all information is timecoded the bits produce an aggregate  i dont want a computerscience lesson bottom line  one of these two logs is a forgery  correction the log just found aboard the stargazer is a forgery  as i said that is one of them is it not  captain  youre looking better sir  a little sleep thanks to the good doctor works wonders  what report on the logs  whoever tampered with your log was clever  but clumsy its definitely a fabrication  number one id like you to take a look at this brainscan graph   what are you doing here  arent i the captain   yes but  thank you for the confirmation  but now except for riker if youd all return to your stations   is that clear  sir  you too doctor i have business with the commander  under protest sir  you have orders for me  release the stargazer from the tractor beam   sir  the tractor beam  sir are you abandoning  no but her inertia will carry the stargazer along with us  or did you sleep through the academy lecture  on the conservation of tractorbeam power  no sir ill release her of course  obviously theres some thoughtprocess disorder  but i cant find a physical reason for it anything  im puzzled too i keep sensing random thoughts  but two sets of them as if they were his  but intermixed with other thoughts which are also his   im busy wesley  i know but this is important  i was at the sensors in engineering trying sensitivity tests  does this have something to do with capt picard  yes maam if this is what youre talking about  i dont know about brain scans but i glanced at these  i noticed that these patterns are the same  as the lowintensity transmissions from the ferengi ship  i went back and checked theyre exactly the same   what kind of transmissions  i dont know  engineering has nothing like it on record   lets get to the captain  no they may affect him to riker  youre welcome ladies  adults  the captain  resting after ordering you to return to your duty stations  there have been some did he say low intensity  unusual lowintensity transmissions from the ferengi vessel   did who say  my son  transmissions which exactly match  certain anomalies found in the captains scans  something over there is affecting the captains thought patterns  computer give me a location on capt picard  capt picard is in transporter room three  what  emergency order to transporter room three  new information capt picard is no longer aboard the enterprise  welcome back captain  what is happening  shields up computer   what are you doing  collecting on an old debt  stargazer captain respond  shields up no way to beam over  im reading something very strange here  a lowintensity beam of intermittent pulse inside this starship  i have a fix on it sir  inside capt picards quarters  you transferred his belongings from the stargazer  yes including a fairly heavy chest  take a look fast  commander stargazer is now powering up sir  i have been waiting a long nine years for this picard   i dont know what you mean  do you not human  can you not remember the crime you committed against my very blood   you murdered my only son  your son  he was commander of the ship you destroyed  on his first voyage as daimon  the ship  the ferengi vessel that attacked me  or is it about to attack me  and i have spent these years searching seeking  a proper blood revenge  and i found it  i am rich picard  yet two of these cost me the profits of an entire life  you are back in command of the stargazer picard  its computers will answer your orders  die well captain  first officers log capt picard has beamed aboard the stargazer  which is moving away from us under its own power  enterprise to stargazer please respond  enterprise to capt picard aboard stargazer please answer  data what was stargazers condition  fire damage to interior surfaces but no main systems were crippled  armaments lt yar  six photon torpedoes short  from when the captain destroyed the ferengi  otherwise fully armed   what is it la forge  a network of miniature circuitry  incredibly complex maybe an amplifier  where was it in the captains quarters  his chest from the stargazer sir where i left it he hadnt unpacked  he may not have known it was there  if this can pick up or magnify thoughtaltering transmissions  it could prepare him for whats happening now  lets find out or try to  contact the ferengi vessel lieutenant  hailing frequencies open sir  enterprise to ferengi vessel we transmit visually do you respond  why is our gift to you under power human   ill discuss it with your captain  he is in our laboratory  where is your captain  hes beamed aboard the stargazer  im wondering if this has something to do with it  how do you have possession of that  it was in our captains chest from the stargazer  it is a forbidden device a thoughtmaker  if your captain is criminal enough to own one  you know who controls those spheres  i ask you again first officer to first officer whats going on  it is not seemly to question ones own daimon riker  i am not prepared to do that   sir i have the stargazer  switch now  enterprise to picard  do not attack again were on a peaceful mission  give your identity  you force us to defend ourselves  phasers full up  arm torpedoes  why arent the shields at full power   weve lost him sir  when he put up the shields  damn i said get the fusion generators under surge control  youre moving much too slowly  arm the torpedoes man  vigo get a firecontrol party up here  shields weakening captain  fusion generator on line   weapons report  phasers coming to full charge  torpedoes armed  who are they identify them  theyre coming for a third pass at us  we cant take another hit captain  sir i now feel anger from our captain  fury over whatever he is reliving out there  the battle of maxia sir  the picard maneuver what is the defense data   there is no defense sir  devise one fast  first officer kazago to human riker  not now kazago  we do not wish to become involved  in what is clearly a federation matter  fine fine enterprise out  you should know that daimon bok no longer commands this vessel  his first officer has confined him  for engaging in this unprofitable venture  good luck first officer riker  i have computed a possibility  deep space contains trace gases  a vessel in the picard maneuver might seem to disappear  but our sensors can locate compression of these gases  an aiming point to blow up our captain  this class starship has enough power to use our tractor beam on it  seize it limit its field of fire  concentrate shields at that point make it so i hope youre right  no question of it sir  stand by  lock on tractor beam  ready phasers  capt picard listen to me   vigo is that you  its cmdr riker sir  captain hear me look around  the ferengi are using thought devices on you  stand by  who is this  its riker sir your number one look for a silver sphere  destroy it with your phaser  phaser  a sphere   bok used it  destroy it  phaser  destroy the sphere  are you alright captain  captain   captain are you alright  where am i number one  aboard the stargazer sir   the sphere was controlling your  bok  where is bok  removed from command placed under guard for his act of vengeance  seems there was no profit in it  in revenge there never is  let the dead rest  and the past  remain the past  enterprise lock on  beam me home riker
