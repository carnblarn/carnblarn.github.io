                captains log stardate 427791  were en route to the epsilon ix sector  for an astronomical survey of a new pulsar cluster  in the meantime ensign crusher will divert to starbase 515  for starfleet exams  this came in for you from starfleet   testing parameters  do not be apprehensive  i found the academy examinations quite elementary  you would  your earlier results earned you a credit for your work here   dont worry about it  cadets are extremely competitive   you have the practical experience  cmdr riker is correct  the information imparted at the academy  is unquestionably vital for prospective starfleet officers  but it requires a significant period of supplementary systems training   and situational disciplines  didnt i just say that  yes sir but not quite as perspicuously  i will not have you telling me what course to set  as chief medical officer i am ordering you   report to starbase 515 now  please i feel fine  the truth is youve ignored this far too long  this ship has a mission to carry out  an astronomical survey to be conducted by science officers  i was looking forward to seeing the epsilon pulsar cluster myself  then well perform the procedure here  absolutely not  my staff and i are capable of giving you the replacement  thats not the point it would be  it would be inappropriate for you to do the procedure  capt picard i had no idea  you do have an ego dont you  meaning  youre concerned about your image  dont worry  if you get yourself to starbase 515 your image will be safe with me   captain excuse me  ensign  im told youre leaving for starbase 515  yes sir i was just going  i have business there i shall accompany you  you will   i mean yes sir  prepare shuttle for departure  aye sir  something i can take care of for you on starbase 515   hardly number one  youll miss the epsilon survey  im well aware of that you have the bridge carry on  come what is it number one  anything wrong this trip to starbase 515 is rather unexpected  ensign crusher and i will rendezvous with you on your return  forgive my saying so sir but youre being rather enigmatic   call it captains privilege  i have complete security clearance  this has nothing to do with ships business  suffice it to say it is strictly a matter of image  relax youll do fine on your exams  they dont worry me its capt picard  why hes not taking the exams  just the two of us in a shuttlecraft for six hours  what am i going to talk to him about  archaeology semantics literature art  you could learn a lot from him  capt picard  nice day for a little trip  shuttle number two ready for departure  the enterprise is at impulse speed you are cleared for takeoff  data didnt the captain look forward to the mission   to the epsilon pulsar cluster  so he said  then what would make him leave the ship now  commander receiving a mayday on all frequencies   source  rhomboid dronegar sector 006   detail  ship unidentified  distress nothing more  set course for rhomboid dronegar 006 warp seven  that would put us at considerable distance from capt picard  i know data  i know  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  entering rhomboid dronegar sector 006  i have a ship on target path   slow to impulse speed  aye sir  viewer   deploy shields sir  hold fast data  basic early design capable of sublight travel only   sir we are being hailed  on screen  cmdr william riker uss enterprise responding to your distress signal  what is your problem  we are far from home  arent we all but you sent out a mayday  do you need help  we are pakleds our ship is the mondor  it is broken  we are far from home we need help  so their rubber band broke right  sensors show engineering problems  total guidance system failure with less than 24 hours reserve power   maybe i can help  what brings you so far from home   we look for things  what were you looking for  things we need  can you be more specific  things that make us go we need help  what is the nature of your mission  we look for things  did you hear an echo  i could get that ship going in no time   sure  yeah  very well our chief engineer will beam over  close  commander  do we truly need to send our chief engineer to them  they need our help  why not give them the information they need to make their own repairs  do you think they could handle our technical specifications  we know nothing about them  acknowledged mr worf we have an obligation to render aid  report to the transporter room with necessary gear   we need more information  do you have anything else on them   they are quite a benign species  dont they seem a little slow  they may merely have poor language skills  what about weapons   scanners show limited armaments  i think we can relax mr worf  they cant even move without our help  we have them outmanned and outgunned  eta 1330 hours sir  its not exactly warp speed  more like a late22ndcentury interplanetary journey  sir  you should read more history ensign  yes sir   a complete waste of time  pardon  i shouldnt be taking this trip i should be on the enterprise  why are you coming with me to starbase 515 sir  well its certainly not my idea  im sorry ensign i didnt mean to take it out on you  i just hate the prospect of another damned cardiac replacement  cardiac replacement  i didnt know  well now you do   a parthenogenic implant  what else would it be  my heart was injured  a replacement was necessary  that would have been it except that the replacement is faulty  why would anyone use a faulty replacement  just pilot the shuttle ensign  wait a minute its ok  im here to help  we are far from home   whos in charge of engineering  my friend his name is reginold  could i meet him   he is reginold  i think you mentioned that  we look for things   so ive heard  can you make our ship go  yes i think so  we look for things to make us go  fellas why dont you just show me where your guidance system is ok  excuse me  he is smart  commander   lt la forge is on an alien ship  yes  were assisting some curious throwbacks  how they ever mastered space travel is a curiosity  commander those aliens  what they feel is not helplessness lt la forge is in great danger  hes in danger great danger   can you be more specific  its not our help they want  our help is all theyll get they cant use force can they  you think theyre weak  look at them theyre not jarada or romulan  our betazoid counsellor is aware of things beyond our perceptions  van dorens technique has been perfected to 24 percent  sir  the cardiacreplacement procedure it has a very low mortality rate   those are pretty good odds  just not overly thrilled at having my innards  becoming the subject of starfleet gossip  of course not sir  why didnt you just have dr pulaski perform the operation  im sure you could have trusted her to keep it quiet  lets say i have personal reasons and leave it at that shall we  the power needs to be rerouted through this venturi chamber  before it can be channelled to the engines coils   it is broken  yeah but not for long  see we are going to reconfigure these separators  here and over here   lt la forge this is cmdr riker  yes commander go ahead   are you alright  sure why do you ask  counsellor troi has expressed misgivings about your absence  theres nothing to worry about  understood once you complete the repairs get back here  yes sir i should be done momentarily  you see like that  there  your guidance is now up and running  main power failure  will our ship go now  your guidance is operational  but youre not going anywhere not with a main power failure  it is broken  can you make it go  cmdr riker   i have a problem  on screen  it looks like this will take longer than i anticipated  i guess youd prefer cmdr riker as a travelling companion  what  its ok youre not too comfortable with me  i understand  ensign wesley thats not true youre a fine young man  you dont have to say that sir its pretty obvious how you feel  is it how so  everyone knows you dont like kids  thats too bad  youd have made a good father  thank you  didnt you ever wish you had kids of your own  wishing for a thing does not make it so  we send him to do one repair now they need him for more  apparently their ship is quite fragile  this is riker on the enterprise  almost got it commander  we look for things  apparently your ship is in need of more than minor repair   things to make it go  we will tow you to a nearby base  he can make it go  but we need our chief engineer back on our ship  he is smart  all done commander   prepare to beam over  yes sir   you are good  we aim to please   we need you  im flattered  fellas i hate to repair and run but if youll excuse me  one to beam aboard  dont   transporter room beam him back  negative response sir   try again  negative response   the pakled ship has a shield up  a shield what kind  it seems beyond their technology similar to romulan shields  do not interfere with our transporter beam drop your shields  status  viewer transmission terminated and blocked   hail on all frequencies  running frequency search   negative sir  theyre ignoring us  apparently so   shields up  shields up  sensors at maximum sensitivity   sensors at maximum  phasers ready sir  care for some coffee ensign  no thank you sir  how about a sandwich  i dont think so sir  come on its been hours you must be hungry  thank you sir  here  were you ever married  never had the time  dont you ever get lonely  for ambitious starfleet officers there are certain costs involved  one must be cautious of longterm commitments wesley  no problem where women are concerned i am in complete control  really  i always rather had to work at that  were you always so disciplined  good lord no if i was i wouldnt have this problem  i dont understand  well  i was a young starfleet officer not much older than you are now  top of my academy class  green as hell  and oh so cocky  too cocky as it turned out  what happened  several friends and i were on leave at farspace starbase earhart  it was little more than a galactic outpost in those days  before the klingons joined the federation  thats right  well my mates and i were at the bonestell recreation facility  which was something of a deadrough crossroads at the time  filled with an assorted bunch of galactic riffraff  a trio of nausicaans came in  clearly spoiling for a confrontation  with a group of freshfaced starfleet officers like ourselves  well everyone had the good sense  to give these nausicaans a wide berth to stand off  everyone that is except me  i stood toe to toe with the worst of them  i told him what i thought of him his pals his planet  and i possibly made a reference to his questionable parentage  and the next thing i knew  all three were on me and i was fighting for my life  i was actually doing quite well for a while  you fought them and won  i had this one nausicaan down in this somewhat devious jointlock  when unbeknownst to me one of his chums drew his weapon  and impaled me through the back  curious sensation actually not much pain  shock certainly  at the sight of serrated metal sticking through my chest  a certain giddy warmth  in fact i do actually remember that i laughed out loud  well it pierced my heart of course  if we had not been so near to a medical facility id have died  really   then what happened  nothing i was no hero wesley  i was an undisciplined loudmouthed opinionated young man  who was way out of his league  i learned a very hard very painful lesson that day  but i learned it well  i hope you never learn it the same way   care for another sandwich  please  come on data  i am programming the comm system to scan interference patterns  a full analysis will take time   you be careful with that thing  you want to hurt us  what i came here to help you   we can make more  make more weapons  wait a minute   you have a replicator  it is not broken  i didnt come to give you weapons  you will make more  commander a photon torpedo may penetrate their shield  any hostile move could jeopardize geordi  agreed   but what do the pakleds want  counsellor  they have what they want for now  were approaching starbase 515 sir  at last  did you read that book i gave you  some of it  thats reassuring  i just dont have much time  there is no greater challenge than the study of philosophy  but william james wont be in my starfleet exams  important things never will be  anyone can be trained in the mechanics of piloting a starship   but starfleet academy  it takes more  open your mind to the past art history philosophy  and all this may mean something  all deception nothing the pakleds have said or done has been sincere  intensified scan shows their guidance system to be intact   as is their power generator  then what was geordi repairing  the putative malfunctions were programmed into their computer  i never knew they had that technology  they seem to have made some technological leaps forward  why go through the charade of needing our help  for the sole purpose of making lt la forge their prisoner  captains personal log stardate 427795  we have arrived at starbase 515 i am still quite uneasy  despite assurances that this medical procedure poses little risk  i hope you wont be late for your exams  i still have some time sir  why do i get the distinct impression youre acting as some kind of escort  dr pulaski asked me to make sure that you actually went inside   that woman she would  sir  what is it ensign  i enjoyed our trip together sir  so did i   they are initiating visual contact  now well see what they want  enterprise  we demand that you return our crew member immediately  request denied   lower your shields  request denied  stop it  what do you want  you think we are not smart  i think you need to continue to develop  we are smart  prove it return our man to us   you want him  yes damn it  good we want all computer information from your ship  now  we have a man held hostage and all i have are nooption options   i need some input  is geordi alright  hes been hit by multiple phaser stuns  he may need medical attention  security are ready to take the initiative sir   data  our options have not changed  we can either respond to the pakled demand or not  we can either use force or not  access to our computer is a breach of starfleet security  then force it must be  dont worry captain weve done this a hundred times  were ready when you are  get on with it doctor i have work to do  activate sterile field  neural callipers  this is a secondary cardiac procedure with midline entry  and excision of the early model unit  i anticipate no complications  the patient has had positive primary results  and shows extraordinary physical condition  well all be home in time for dinner  tissue mitigator  there is limited information on the pakled culture  but their eclectic equipment suggests their technology comes from others   and now theyve become militant  so it seems  rationale  they are unwilling to wait for the timely evolution  of their intellectual capacity  they want instant knowledge instant power and gratification  the more they get the more they want  and the more dangerous they become its time we set some limits  to what effect we are faced with an impossible conundrum  why not turn their impatience and greed against them  but how  geordi could give them something they want something important  then we create the moment for him to take it away and get him outta there   would you be suggesting a ruse  i would  but what if we fail whatll happen to geordi then  we have no other choice we have to try  theres been some capillary reaction here  lets proceed carefully  well need sharper focus on the thoracic polychromatics  and verification of myocardial enzyme balance  let me talk to him  ill get you their computer banks  we wanna be smart  so open the hailing frequency theyll listen to me   we are smart  we need their computer things  yes   cmdr riker  yes lieutenant were here  the pakleds seem pretty sincere  we want what we want   our computers are nonnegotiable  we want them  believe me theyre nothing if not persistent  we want to be nothing if not persistent  nobody calls them great conversationalists   where did they get their shields  yes we like shields  from what ive seen half the systems on board have been stolen  from the romulans klingon jarada  almost anyone theyve ever had contact with  we like to be smart  confirmed lt la forge they steal technology  but they lack the ability to use it properly  youre an excellent chief engineer lt la forge  thank you sir  and your knowledge of phaser and photon weaponry is unmatched  nice of you to say so sir but really lt worf is  our missions are always inherently dangerous  any of us could be called on to make the ultimate sacrifice at any time  yes sir but  speaking of time  this may be your time  i shall personally miss you  goodbye geordi i shall miss you at weapons systems analysis  i guess youll just have to arm your photon torpedoes without me  as well as our hydrogen collectors fond farewell   he knows about weapons  you can make us strong  its not something i like to talk about  any classifiedweapons knowledge shared with them will be treason  but i may have no choice  you will die without honour  thanks a lot worf  you will never attain the 24th level of awareness   thats quite a challenge  indeed 24 is the gateway to heroic salvation   do you think he understands  hed better   hes afraid  we all are counsellor  you are smart  not smart enough im still here   make us strong  you wanted me to help you go  lets work on that guidance system ok  make us strong  or die  its not working somethings wrong  the metabolation occlusions arent holding  damn it i cant stop the heterocyclic declination  fuse  again  we need a biomolecular physiologist in here this man is dying  right away sir   youve got to be kidding  make us strong  theres not enough juice here to blow up a passing asteroid  do it make us strong  i suppose we could increase the antimatter charges  yes we like power   yeah  do not try to trick us  we can tell  metabolation   negative  heterocyclics  failing and capillary integrity too unpredictable to try a resect  youre unwilling to attempt it   im not qualified  i know someone who is  can he do it geordis an engineer not a weapons specialist  if anyone can improvise its geordi  do the pakleds have that kind of gear  ongoing scanning indicates progressive weapons potential  the timing will be crucial geordi must interpret our intentions  geordis up to speed i trust him  the pakleds heard our fiction about his weapons knowledge  and as they equate intelligence with strength  they wont miss a chance to use that knowledge can you do it  count on it   bridge to cmdr riker  go ahead bridge  i am receiving an emergency summons from starbase 515  capt picard is close to death  be ready  we are strong  you are armed to the teeth  teeth are for chewing  you have photon torpedo you are strong  we are strong  we have power  positive indication of armed photon torpedoes commander  geordi did it  starbase request we proceed to base at warp nine  weve got to go  the captain needs our help  we cant leave geordi behind i want the pakleds on that screen now  forced spectrum communication is spotty at best sir  do it  this is the enterprise return our personnel or face reprisal  we are strong now we have better weapons  are you prepared to use them  we are a force now we will have respect power  we dont have time for this you want power here ensign gomez   ready  prepare firing sequence  start firing countdown from 24  i cant believe it my friends are trying to kill us kill me  believe it they are violent  ok they want to play rough fine with me let me check something  good he is on our side now  begin firing sequence      firing sequence proceeding  hold fast    dont do anything yet   what are you doing  checking your system is operative  we will attack we are strong  nine eight  seven  six five  we should attack now  one second we cant afford a misfire here  hurry  fire  now  no too late  we have fired they will be destroyed   they used the crimson force field  it did not shoot  no the crimson force field has disarmed us  they are smart   we are not strong  drop your shields  allow us to transport lt la forge immediately   shields are down sir  beam one to the bridge  set heading for starbase 515 warp nine  that hydrogen exhaust sure put on a nice light show  harmless but effective you disabled the photons  just in time thats why youre alive  deactivating neural callipers  what the hell are you doing here  saving your life  come on  this is a routine procedure  quite commonplace  true but you are not a commonplace man  youll be out of recovery in four hours  i didnt want you involved in this  youre welcome  if youre here the entire crew must know  youre still the captain invincible  thank you   i beg your pardon  seems things are back to normal  im pleased to report ensign crushers exam results  permit him to continue his studies on the enterprise  furthermore any rumours of my brush with death  are greatly exaggerated is that clear  yes sir  then ensign crusher set course for the epsilon sector warp five  engage
