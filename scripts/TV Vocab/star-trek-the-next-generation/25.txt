                first officers log stardate 419860  we await the return of capt picard  who was summoned to starbase 718 for an emergency conference  meanwhile our sensors are monitoring an ancient capsule  which appears to be from earth  i wonder how it got out here  at present speed and heading  it will enter the kazis binary system and be destroyed  i could use a tractor beam to adjust its heading  i think not its just debris  we only noticed it because were waiting here  let it be let nature take its course  how long until capt picard returns  the last communication indicated several hours  request permission to investigate this vehicle   why its a derelict  it is a piece of history  the opportunity to examine an ancient vehicle does not come often  and as you pointed out we do have the time  very well be ready to beam back before the captain returns   thank you sir  lt worf go with him  aye sir  minimal oxygen atmosphere  an ancient solar generator still operating  commander look at this  the onboard computers have ceased functioning  i may be able to download this disk drive to the enterprise  must be sealed probably with age  not necessary  the seal has been broken and the environment corrupted  heres another  this one is empty  commander look at this  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  were they frozen for an extended journey  if so there would be evidence of more sophisticated monitoring  these containers were designed solely for refrigeration  the captains shuttle is approaching the shuttle bay  this is the captain i want to go when the shuttle is secure  well make all preparations  cmdr data return to the enterprise immediately  we have an unusual situation sir  there are people on board frozen  frozen how many  three the vehicle has suffered severe damage  most of her systems have failed  should they be transferred to the enterprise  i do not believe we should leave them here sir  with your permission we will return with three containers  whatever you do do it quickly  mr la forge set course 058 mark 173  number one staff meeting on observation deck  captain those coordinates will take us into the neutral zone  that is correct mr la forge warp factor eight   aye sir warp eight  engage  two federation outposts in sector 30 have been destroyed  theres been no communication with federation starbases in sector 31  since stardate 419032   romulans  thats the assumption  theres been no contact with the romulans  since the tomed incident  the questions are why now whats their objective  for 50 years barely a whisper  now for no apparent reason theyre back with a roar  all we know of them is based on rumor or conjecture  the strategic decision is to send one ship  the enterprise  we could find ourselves greatly overmatched  true enough its a gamble  this first encounter coming so suddenly after all this time  we assume its a setup  if force is necessary we will use it  but our goal is to establish relations with the romulans  if we dont succeed then to convince them of our resolve  the feeling at starfleet is that they are seeking confrontation  they may want to test themselves in battle  against a federation starship  see how weve advanced if that is so i need to know it  ill need a full profile  there is limited information but i will prepare something  computer estimated time of arrival at the neutral zone   lets reassemble in six hours  stay sharp no surprises  id rather outthink them than outfight them questions   what is it doctor  the people from the capsule   capsule what people  the people data beamed over   i wasnt aware that he had  he did they were frozen  i thawed them   you what  what else could i do  the crypts in which they were frozen were falling apart   so whats their condition  right now theyre all sleeping  each one needed minor medical attention  minor now but then their conditions were terminal  one had a heart problem  another advanced emphysema with extensive liver damage  most surprising of all each had been frozen after they died  after they died  cryonics it was a kind of fad in the late 20th century  people feared dying  it terrified them  so at the moment of death they would be frozen  so that at some time in the future  when a cure had been found for what killed them  they could be thawed healed and sent about their business  in the case of this group it apparently worked  mr data report to sickbay  immediately  look i am never critical of any member of my staff being curious  but its just that the timing is so  i could not leave them their vehicle was deteriorating  data they were already dead  what more could have happened to them  i see your point at the time it seemed the proper thing to do  well theyre alive now  well have to treat them as living human beings  alive and well and ready to be awakened  before you wake them i want security here  lt worf report to sickbay  theyre sedated but they should be up as soon as possible  well then we have no other choice  none that i can see  welcome to the 24th century  i retrieved some information from the ancient disk  i removed from their computer  her name is clare raymond age 35 occupation homemaker  must be some kind of construction work  she died of an embolism it was probably very sudden  otherwise her physical condition was excellent  his name is ralph offenhouse age 55 occupation financier  advanced cardiomyopathy  inoperable at the time but easily correctable now  he mustve known his condition was terminal for some time  much of his file we could not retrieve  his name is lq sonny clemonds  his occupation had something to do with music  there was marked deterioration in every system of his body  probably massive chemical abuse unbelievable  sounds like someone who hated life  yet he had himself frozen so he could go through it all again  too afraid to live too scared to die  doctor this situation is more suited to your talents  ill be on the bridge  number one  take charge of our guests until we decide what to do with them  aye sir  number one keep them out of my way  i know this is very confusing to you so ill attempt to explain  you are on the starship uss enterprise  american  no the united federation of planets earth is a member  what year is this  by your calendar 2364  what  my heart is it  its perfectly fine  in fact all of you are now in excellent health  it worked i made it  what is that  an android  you mean a robot  there is a distinct difference between an android and a robot  and him the one i saw before with the head  she means worf  hes a klingon that takes a little more explanation  i paid some idiot a lot of money to freeze me when i died  i just got to hear the words am i alive  yes absolutely  and the liver that was about to explode in my face  perfectly sound  excuse me could someone tell me whats going on here  about 370 years ago you died of a massive embolism  i dont remember anything about that  you and the others were frozen  cryonics you know freeze you now and heal you later  yeah ive heard of it i just never gave it much thought   how did we get here  you were in a space module  the wacko that sold me this scam  said that in orbit thered be no brownout  yes several cryonics companies fell into disrepute  because power failures adversely affected their refrigeration system  their stocks were severely depressed  the whole deal was a long shot  but i figured id give them the dough instead of my exwives  but son i figured it was a bunch of hooey  hooey  as in hogwash malarkey jive an intentional fabrication  there you go you got it  now if you didnt contract for this who did  it must have been my husband donald  if it was new and foolish hed pop for it  well its the first thing he bought into that worked  i for one never had a doubt  my stock in this company must have split a dozen times by now  actually the process of cryonics was never more than a fad  it did not continue beyond the mid21st century  i need to make a phone call   a phone call  yes i have provided for myself  i have a substantial portfolio its critical that i check on it  let the bank know im alive and well  its gonna be difficult at the moment  do you at least have a copy of the wall street journal  lets take the doctors advice  take this very slowly until weve adjusted  then well talk to the captain  as you know sir there is little available on the romulans   anything would be helpful  they are creatures of extremes  one moment violent beyond description the next tender  they are related to the vulcans but as each race developed  their differences grew wider  theyre intensely curious  their belief in their own superiority is beyond arrogance  for some reason they have a fascination with humans  that fascination more than anything has kept the peace  one other thing they will not initiate anything  they will wait for you to commit yourself  counterpunchers  thank you counselor thats quite valuable  talk  id like me a thick kansas city steak  and some country fried potatoes and a mess of greens  hell forget all that  give me a martini straight up with two olives  for the vitamins  is something wrong  wrong your computer fixed about the best martini i ever had  i might get to like this place  lets see if the braves are on how do you turn on the tv   tv  yeah the boob tube  id like to see how the braves are doing  probably still finding ways to lose  i believe he means television sir  that form of entertainment did not last much beyond 2040  well what do you guys do  you dont drink and you aint got no tv  must be kind of boring aint it  number one  riker here  would you and mr data report to the bridge  at once sir  with whom were you speaking   the captain  good  would you tell him id like to see him as soon as its convenient  whatll happen to us do we stay here go back to earth   thats up to the captain  well get him in here  i have to phone geneva about my accounts  the interest alone could be enough to buy this ship  the yankees right get the big boy in here  ill pass along your request excuse us  duty calls i understand  come back later on well find a couple of lowmileage pit woofies  and help em build a memory   what is to be done with them sir  i dont know  commander a lowmileage pit woofie  this time youve got me i havent a clue  they are the most unusual humans i have encountered  from what ive seen theres not much to redeem them  how did our species survive the 21st century  report  we are six hours from the neutral zone  i have been unable to make contact with any federation colony here   how many outposts are nearby  nine  we should assume theyve been destroyed   by the romulans  it fits their historical pattern  weve had no contact with the romulans  for 53 years seven months 18 days  we must consider our information out of date  so the information they have about us is also out of date  i think its that lack of information that this is about  go on  the romulans want a confrontation specifically with us   the enterprise  not by name but the federation  they know the federation will send their best  enabling them to see how far we have advanced in technology and technique   what are you recommending  ive no specific recommendation  perhaps we should assume the initiative  i agree this may be our only opportunity  we should seize it  mr data  the strategy is built on a single premise their hostile intent  if the premise is sound so is the proposal  if their intention isnt hostile what is it  capt picard  this is capt picard to whom am i speaking  ralph offenhouse  i need to talk to you  number one did you give him permission to contact me  no he must have seen me use the comm panel  listen mr offenhouse were in a very important conference  im sick of being put off  by you and your staff this is the worstrun ship ive been on  you should learn from the qe2 thats an efficient operation  data identify what is a qe2  it was a passenger liner which traveled earths atlantic ocean  in late 20th early 21st centuries  hes comparing the enterprise to a cruise ship  capt picard i demand that you see me  i think i have been very very patient  i demand a phone or a radio or whatever else you have  frankly enough is enough  especially considering what i paid for this procedure  i must contact my law  im capt picard  excellent maybe we can get some things straightened out  indeed those comm panels are for official ship business  so why dont they need an executive key  aboard a starship that is not necessary  we are capable of selfdiscipline you will refrain from using them  just a minute  we are in a serious potentially dangerous situation  im sure it seems very important to you  but my situation is far more critical  i dont think youre aware of your situation  or of how much time has passed  im fully cognizant of where i am and when  but i have more to protect  than a man in your position could possibly imagine  no offence meant  but a military career was never considered to be upwardly mobile  i must contact my lawyer  your lawyers been dead for centuries  of course i know that  but he was a full partner in a very important firm  rest assured that firm is still operating  thats what all this is about  a lot has changed in the past 300 years  people are no longer obsessed with the accumulation of things  weve eliminated hunger want the need for possessions  weve grown out of our infancy  youve got it all wrong it has never been about possessions  its about power   power to do what  to control your life your destiny  that kind of control is an illusion  really  im here arent i  i should be dead but im not  what is it  i dont know it just started and it wont stop  i keep thinking about my boys  counselor troi will you report to the guest lounge  captain we are approaching science station delta 05  slow to half impulse im on my way  captain i need to see that pretty little doctor of yours  ill inform her  i didnt mean to come on so strong  its just ive built my whole life on knowing whats going on  for the first time i feel  completely out of touch  its making me crazy you can understand that  its the first thing youve said i do understand  ill see what i can do and please stay off the comm panels  counselor will you get those people under control  we cant afford this continuing distraction  yes sir  hello  my names deanna  they sent you here to settle me down  im the ships counselor i thought you might want to talk  the local shrink   im not familiar with that term  it doesnt matter  youre feeling profoundly sad  i cant stop crying  i miss my sons  and then i think im here but theyre gone  donald thats my husband  i love that man but  good intentions aside hed mess up a free lunch  why on earth he ever decided to do this  he must have thought you wouldve wanted it  no i can tell you what happened  he couldnt think about going on alone  i died and he couldnt face it so he had me frozen  in his mind i wasnt really gone  it sounds crazy but you had to know donald  i wish i knew what happened to my children  did they marry did they have kids  lets see if we can find out  computer this is counselor troi  request personal history on what are their names  tommy hes eight and eddie is five  full names date and place of birth  they were born in secaucus thats in jersey  can this really work can this tell me what happened to them  there must be a record somewhere theres a good chance well find it  well whether we do or not i want to thank you for trying  date of birth tommy was born february 17th  i need something to jumpstart the morning  and something else to shut down the night  you have no medical need  it aint a matter of need darling its a matter of survival  sorry  well old watoshll scuffle along best he can  wheres that fella with the strange face  i beg your pardon  whatshisname the android fella   you mean lt cmdr data  thats the one   ill tell him you want him  much obliged  youre just about the prettiest doctor i ever seen  much obliged  this is amazing its all right here  ten generations of your progeny  everyone ive ever known is dead  do you mind id like to be alone  no not at all  you asked to see me  im about to go outta my mind sitting here just dont get it   what say you and i put on a party  a celebration  nothing that fancy just some folks some suds and some sounds  its just something to do   i will speak to the captain  great do that  inquiry you are not having as much difficulty  adjusting to your circumstances as the others  you mean being on this tub  heck its the same dance its just a different tune  does anybody here have a guitar  no but the computer can replicate one  i want one while i still remember the chords  were approaching the neutral zone report to the bridge  i must leave  whats this neutral zone  a buffer between the romulan empire and the federation   why does that make me nervous  i do not know  we wont be inviting these romulans to our party  no that would not be appropriate  captains log supplemental  we have arrived at the edge of the neutral zone  we will have an opportunity to learn firsthand  what happened to our distant outpost  captain there is nothing left of outpost delta 05  must have been one hell of an explosion  sensors indicate no evidence of conventional attack  can you determine what happened  the outpost was not just destroyed  its as though some great force scooped it off the planet  could it have been a natural phenomenon  insufficient information sir  set the course for the next station  i have spent my entire career being able to tell  when the other guys mouth is dry  there is something going on here something serious  the tension level on this ship has jumped up  even if you are right what can we do  these old boys dont need us telling them where the bear sits  look what that fella made for me  how did he do that  he called it pattern replication it plays real good too  i tell you there is a situation developing that directly affects us  all you can talk about is that guitar  they dont need us swimming in their soup  so relax and let em do their jobs  that may be alright for you  but i am not willing to allow my fate to be decided by others  i want to know what is going on  we are approaching tarod ix  the condition is identical  everyone and everything is gone  i strongly recommend we go to red alert  if the romulans have improved their cloaking  and wed be fools to doubt it  we should assume a more defensive posture  i agree i recommend we go immediately to battle stations  i appreciate your advice but it is no time for rash actions  there are three other stations to visit  lets proceed in an orderly manner  may we at least go to yellow alert  yes number one make it so  all decks yellow alert  lets see  i want to go to the  where would the captain be  capt picard is located on the main bridge  well then take me to the main bridge  captain my sensors indicate a disturbance  it is large and moving i cannot get a lock  nor can i get it on the viewscreen  shields up  i recommend we transfer power to phasers and arm the photon torpedoes  wait if it is romulan they will read our intent  itll force them into taking a similar posture   we dont want battle  this is sufficient evidence  outposts have been destroyed countless lives lost  i have a positive lock  theyre disengaging their cloaking  theyll only be vulnerable for an instant as they become visible  captain this may be our only chance  no   where are they  the signal is weakening  ive lost them  damn  mr data are your sensors picking up anything  you should be detecting a disturbance  negative sir  we wanted to know if theyd improved cloaking  we have our answer  they wanted to determine our intent to see if we would fire  who the hell are they  get that man off the bridge now  im not going anywhere  theyre back  amazing  i never thought id see a romulan vessel so close  last time we encountered them was decades ago  cost thousands of lives  i can believe that  stay calm everyone  open hailing frequencies  captain these are romulans  they are without honor  they killed my parents in an attack on khitomer  when they were meant to be our allies  they believe humans and klingons are a waste of skin  control your emotions please open hailing frequencies  hailing frequencies open  romulan vessel this is capt jeanluc picard of the uss enterprise  sensors indicate all of their systems are armed sir  but theyve not fired  i am cmdr tebok  commander you have crossed the neutral zone  this is federation territory  it was necessary  it might be viewed as aggression  if our intent were aggression you would not be here now  if we go to war let us be sure it is for the right reason  we are here because our outposts which border on the neutral zone  were also attacked  destroyed in the same manner as your own  even so what gives them the right to enter federation space  silence your dog  lt worfs question is valid  to even ask such a question implies that we need permission  we do not  do you think that we attacked your outposts  once we realized the level of destruction  we knew it could not have been you  who is responsible  they havent got a clue  theyre hoping you know but theyre too arrogant to ask   youre out of line mister  but its a correct assessment  we do not know who is responsible  why entire outposts on both sides have been carried off  i would like to offer a proposal  an alliance between the romulans and the federation  nothing so grandiose just this cooperation  there was an intent here  whoever or whatever did this is more powerful than either of us  lets collaborate  lets share whatever we learn about what has happened here  agreed on this one issue  and only if it is convenient and appropriate at the time  because your actions are those of a thoughtful man  ill tell you this  matters more urgent caused our absence  now witness the result  outposts destroyed  expansion of the federation everywhere  yes  we have indeed been negligent  but no more  commander we have made some progress here  lets not ruin it with unnecessary posturing  your presence is not wanted  do you understand my meaning  we are back  i think our lives just became a lot more complicated  get him off my bridge  ive found something  ive located a family living just outside indianapolis  the mans name is thomas raymond  thats my sons name tommy  computer let us see thomas raymond  oh my god  thats donald thats my husband  actually its your greatgreat greatgreatgreatgrandson  hes the spitting image  well i have his address when you get back you can visit him  no ill be out of time a relic  perhaps but its a place to start  after all he is family  theres no denying that  heres what i propose  i have arranged a rendezvous with uss charleston bound for earth   theyll deliver you there  then what will happen to us  theres no trace of my money my office is gone  what will i do how will i live  this is the 24th century material needs no longer exist  then whats the challenge  the challenge mr offenhouse is to improve yourself  to enrich yourself  enjoy it  well one good thing is  since everyones forgotten everything i ever did  itll all be brand spanking new  ill be a bigger hit than i ever was  perhaps so anything is possible  what say you son youd make a helluva sideman  that offer does present a certain fascination  captain ive plotted a course to intercept the charleston  but they say theyre making an extended stop at arloff ix  your point mr la forge  we could have our guests at starbase 39 sierra in five days  take months off their journey  the extra time will allow them to acclimate before reaching earth  its a pity we cant take them  having them here is like a visit from the past  that would take us in the wrong direction  our mission is to go forward and its just begun  set velocity warp six  aye sir warp six  theres still much to do  still so much to learn  engage
