                number one join me in the ready room  yes sir  ive come from a meeting with admiral moore  he wanted to discuss this  recognize it  sounds like an sos  good guess youre quicker than starbase research  they took hours to realize it was a distress beacon   when was it detected  last month  just kicked in without any warning   who used the beacon  its terran  im familiar with most earth codes and  interesting  yes that code hasnt been used in centuries   what was its origin point  ficus sector  theres no record of an earth colony there  now we know someones out there and theyre asking for help   but who  lets try and find out  computer download all information regarding  signal beacon from starbase mainframe  distress beacon used by the european hegemony  the european hegemony  a loose alliance formed in the early 22nd century  the first stirrings of a world government read more history  computer locate the exact dates  in which this signal beacon was in general use  old earth calendar 2123 until 2190  no extraterrestrial source ever used this code  negative  computer locate all earth deepspace launches from 2123 to 2190   with the destination in or near the ficus sector  working  nothing for ficus  damn it whos out there  lost sheep  lets see if we can find them  medical emergency dr pulaski to the bridge  what happened  he just collapsed sir  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  captains log stardate 428232  were departing from starbase 73  to investigate the source of the mysterious distress signal  meanwhile my security officer remains in sickbay  where dr pulaski is searching for the cause of his collapse   im fine  youre not you fainted  i did not faint klingons do not faint  excuse me ill rephrase  this klingon suffered a dramatic drop in blood pressure  his blood glucose level dropped  there was deficient blood flow resulting from circulatory failure  in other words he curled up his toes  and lay unconscious on the floor  doctor there is no need to insult me  worf i am worried  now something is wrong klingons dont faint  forgive me i cant think of another word  youre sick   klingons do not yield to illness  stay still  i have to check something with the computer  lieutenant you have ropngor   but that is a childhood ailment  yes  how shall i live down the humiliation   worf you cant help  still  for a warrior to find himself in such a situation  so youve got the klingon version of the measles  how would cmdr riker feel if he had the measles   pretty silly  doctor how is lt worf  hes in no danger  worf was just observing a klingon ritual involving fasting  he didnt take into account that you must decrease physical activity  as you decrease caloric intake  pulaski out  thank you i am in your debt  come  captain ive been considering the problem of the missing ship  the lack of any record of a launch to ficus  would not be unusual in the chaos of the early 22nd century  but someone loaded that ship   the manifest  yes sir  there it is ss mariposa loaded 27th november 2123  destination ficus sector capt walter granger commanding  mariposa the spanish word for butterfly   thank you data  i thought it might be significant   it doesnt appear to be data  no sir  you learn a lot from luggage  five monitorbeacon satellites    spinning wheels access  cattle chickens pigs  a device used for spinning yarn which consists of a large wheel  why would anyone carry such an insane mix of cargo  they were planning for the worst  theorize data give me some background  in the early 22nd century earth was recovering from world war iii  a major philosopher then was liam dieghan  he began the neotranscendentalists advocating return to a simpler life  one lived in harmony with nature and learned under her tutelage  thank you data  but if this was a ship full of utopians  why carry all this technological baggage  i have insufficient information upon which to form a theory sir  doctor  i wished to thank you for protecting my  your secret is safe with me  worf i am honoured  no one has ever performed the klingon tea ceremony for me   there that should do it  you know the ceremony  i understand the externals not the mysteries im not a klingon  do not drink the tea it is deadly to humans  and none too good for klingons  it is a test of bravery of ones ability to look at mortality  it is also a reminder that death is an experience best shared   like the tea  worf youre a romantic  it is among the klingons that love poetry achieves its fullest flower  hold that thought  antidote  if were going to share lets share  now quote me a little of that poetry   initiate sensor sweeps  aye sir  the systems sun has entered a period of severe flare activity  that explains the sos  classm readings from the fifth planet in the system   take us in  shields at maximum  sensors indicate human life forms  hailing on all frequencies  no response but the flares may interfere with communications  theres no evidence of an advanced communication network  wheres that technology they brought  there is no artificial power source on the planet  stellar flares are increasing in magnitude and frequency  computer projections indicate they will brush the planet in 36 hours  evacuation will be difficult  we can lower shields for transport only between flares  captain these people have been isolated for 300 years  they could be very unsophisticated  the shock of being transported onto a spaceship could frighten them  your point is well taken counsellor  number one youre going to have to go down there  on my way  captains log stardate 428273  cmdr riker has reached the caverns  where hes making preparations for the evacuation   whats the situation number one  there are 200 people here   their condition  surprisingly good   will they leave  yes but   get them up here  im debating with their leader  no time number one initiate transport   but sir  any problems well address up here  aye aye sir were on our way all of us riker out  first load ready mr obrien  energizing  captain youd better get somebody down here right away  take the pig out now will ya very good  obrien that third wave should be ready  aye sir  obrien is it  i shouldve known twould be an irishman running the ship   what the devil is going on here  capt picard is it  the man who makes decisions for us without so much as a byyourleave  this is my security chief lt worf  i dont suppose security is a problem for you  danilo odell sir at your service   why are these animals here  sorry sir  it was this or arguing till hell froze over  capt picard sir we cant leave our animals here to die  besides how could we build our future without our animals  alright  chief obrien transport this group directly to cargo hold seven  and beam the remaining refugees from the planet directly to that hold  right lads everybody back onto the infernal machine  alright everybody up  captain twas very good of you sir to rescue us from our troubles  my pleasure  you must be worth quite a bit to own a fine ship like this  i dont own the enterprise i command her  whatever sir would you happen to be married   no why  no  well you see sir i have a daughter  felicitations   would you be interested sir  no   youre quite sure  quite sure  hes quite sure   whats the total  223  count on two more in the next few days  head for the nearest starbase  they were anachronistic in 2123 i wonder how theyll cope  theyll learn and adapt  odell will be running this place within a week   lt worf here report  fire in cargo hold seven   the bringloidi  what have they done now  keep the area clear   report  fire has been contained no damage  unseal the doors  my god picard the place is a bloody deathtrap  lightning bolts falling from the ceiling  what the hell was that thing  automated fire system  a force field contains the flame until the remaining oxygen is used  what if id been under that thing  you would have been in the fire  yeah well i mean what would have happened to me  you would have suffocated and died  sweet mercy  there you are your hospitality leaves a hell of a lot to be desired  you dont offer us a bite or sup  and when we build a fire to cook the place goes mad  i my apologies  i was unaware that you had not been instructed  in the use of the food dispensers  what are you staring at never seen a woman before  i thought i had  commander may i present my daughter brenna odell  pleased to meet you maam  you may have all the time in the world  but ive got frightened children and women to care for  what about the men  im sure theyll find their comfort in the bottom of a mug of brew  pay no heed commander shes a fine girl  shes not usually so sharptongued  dado  sir  thats the last thing i expected  sometimes number one  you just have to bow to the absurd  captain sir how did the ship sense the fire   well the ships computer  computer  the ships computers sense a localized increase  men always talking when theres work to be done  shouldnt you be flying this ship or whatever it is you do  sir i think ill stay and help  that isnt necessary the ship will clean itself  well good for the bloody ship  tell me cmdr riker where does a girl go to wash her feet here  as first officer i feel its my responsibility  to show you all the amenities  she is much like a klingon woman  captain theres just one other thing it slipped my mind  the point mr odell  yeah well in all your travels  have you heard anything from the other colony  the other colony  captains log supplemental stellar charts reveal a classm planet  only half a light year from the bringloid system  i presume it was the destination of the colony  which owned the sophisticated equipment  william riker youre a mess   you dont have to do that  if i dont who will  i can see why your father wants to marry you off  and why is that  so he can have a pipe and a beer in peace  youve shown me so many wonders on your great ship  but theres one thing left  whats that  im still waiting to wash my feet  right behind that door  william is something wrong  what do you mean  do you not like girls  of course i do  is there a special technique to this foot washing  you generally start at the top and work your way down  i think i can handle that  i was hoping you might   you sent for me  yes  now were brewing poteen but we need to find a way to heat it  without this bloody ship firing bloody lightning bolts at us  you can get spirituous liquor from the food dispensers  its not that synthehol bilge obrien offered me is it  no if you wish it can be real alcohol   good  with all the deleterious effects  as it should be  you see lad every moment of pleasure in life  has to be purchased by an equal moment of pain  whiskey  terrible it has no bite  chechtluth  now thats what i call a wee drop of the creature  father  remember what i said about the moment of pain tis about to begin  hello my darlin  my darlin is it i mightve known  can you still talk to dr pulaski about the children  what about them  she wants to send them to school   what do you think  i think its a good idea  so go handle it  and im sure theres something you can be doing with your time   and as for you  what  why tell them this magic wall gives more than meat and potatoes  now theyll never work  madam have you ever considered a career in security  if its like babysitting im an expert  captains log supplemental we are approaching the classm planet  where we hope to find the other colonists  signal from the planet captain  on screen  this is capt jeanluc picard of the uss enterprise  from the united federation of planets  this is wonderful welcome captain  i am wilson granger prime minister of mariposa  no doubt a descendant of capt walter granger  not quite a descendant  we feared earth had met disaster when no one came for us  im afraid the truth is you got lost in the bureaucracy  but despite the lateness of our arrival  were here now and eager to renew ties  splendid please come down and allow us  to extend our hospitality to you and your crew  thank you form an away team number one   i would urge caution  caution whats wrong   hes hiding something  well check it out mr worf  dr pulaski come to transporter room three for an away detail  welcome to mariposa im victor granger minister of health  cmdr william riker dr pulaski lt worf  a pleasure ill escort you to the prime minister this way please  twin brothers  your arrival is serendipitous  how so  well  perhaps ill let the prime minister explain that  triplets  worf there is something damn odd going on here  quadruplets  doctor is your title scientific or medical   medical  excellent  is there some medical problem we should know about  i think it best if the  prime minister explains i thought you might  yes excuse me  gentlemen  please follow me  this way  doctor  welcome to mariposa  dr katherine pulaski  my chief of staff elizabeth vallis  tell me is your entire population made up of clones prime minister  clones  clones  clones  captains log supplemental  prime minister granger desires an urgent meeting  to discuss the future of the mariposan colony  ive invited him to the enterprise  captain we need your help  during our landing on mariposa  the skin of our ship was breached  only five of the colonists survived  the progenitors werent willing to just give up and die  and they were scientists  so they used that expertise and turned to cloning  yes we had no other option  two women and three men were an insufficient gene pool  from which to build a society  how did you suppress the natural sexual drive drugs punitive laws  in the beginning a little bit of each  now after 300 years  the entire concept of sexual reproduction is repugnant to us  how did you overcome the problem of replicative fading  we havent  you have got a problem  i dont understand replicative fading  each time you clone you make a copy of a copy errors creep in  eventually you get a nonviable clone   how can we help you  we need an infusion of fresh dna  i was hoping you would be willing to share some tissue samples  you want to clone us   yes  no way not me   how could you possibly be harmed  its not a question of harm  one william riker is unique perhaps even special  but a hundred of him diminishes me in ways i cant even imagine  you would be preserving yourself  human beings have other ways of doing that we have children  i think you will find that attitude prevalent  among all the enterprise people  i see  well  if you are not willing to share your dna  can your people help repair our malfunctioning equipment  of course number one put a team together   lets start  yes sir  la forge gather a technical support away team in transporter room three  captain with your permission may i return to the planet  it could be my last chance to study replicative fading  with your permission mr prime minister  you are welcome perhaps you will find a solution weve overlooked  i appreciate the compliment but i dont think thats very likely  and repairing that equipment will certainly not solve your problems  what other solution do we have  doctor remember there are only five of us  captains log supplemental  cmdr riker and dr pulaski have returned to mariposa  with a team of enterprise technicians  were almost finished i wish there was more we could do  are you sure you wont reconsider   about the cloning  out of the question  excuse me sir i was i was looking for cmdr riker   im afraid i havent seen him  dr pulaski  sorry i cant help  ill just have to hunt for them sorry to disturb you  what happened to you two on mariposa everything alright  any reason it shouldnt be  whenever i asked where you were they lied  lied  with this i can see better than most people  if someone lies there are physiological manifestations  variations in blush response pupil dilation pulse breath rate  its hard with aliens but humans got em nailed  they lied about our whereabouts i dont remember anything happening  i was working and got a call to report to grangers office   i ran into will  wait a minute  granger said he hadnt seen either of you   did you make it to his office  i think  i dont remember  whats the prognosis  geordi youre not missing any epithelial cells   great  will and l however are   meaning  while you can clone from any cell  those lining the stomach are best as they are undifferentiated   wherere you going  the cloning lab  stop   murderers  like hell damn thief   gentlemen please  what else could we do  we asked for your help and you refused us were desperate   that gave you the right to rob us  we have the right to survive  doctor how desperate is the colonys situation  in two or three generations the fading will be terminal  theyre among the walking dead now theyre just unburied  i want their equipment inspected who knows what else they stole  we have a right to exercise control over our own bodies  youll get no argument from me  i know the mariposan culture seems alien even frightening  but really we have much in common  theyre humans fighting for survival would we do less  are you saying we should give them the dna  thats just postponing the inevitable  if they get an infusion of fresh dna  in 15 generations theyll go back to the same problems  cloning isnt the answer what they need is breeding stock   the bringloidi  yes  they have energy and drive  the clones have the emotional maturity and technical knowledge  they started out together it seems only fitting they end up together  its a match made in heaven  it will have to be a shotgun wedding  captain its out of the question  youre trying to dump your problems on us  dont you understand the bringloidi can help you  look at him how could we ever integrate that into our society  youre no prize yourself  primitive hostile disruptive  it would require enormous efforts to even educate them  forget it capt picard  im not coming hat in hand begging charity from this blatherskite  stop i will not allow posturing and bigotry to destroy this meeting  now please sit down  now  cmdr riker has asked that your laboratories be inspected  for stolen tissue samples i understand his concern  we may have to transport all your equipment to the enterprise  i see when reason fails youll resort to blackmail  fine destroy yourselves  its not so bad  in 50 years well have a classm planet ready for colonisation  you see the end is closer than you like to think  i dont know there are so many difficulties  look man we are decent hardworking people  were willing to learn  theyre so different  it is the differences that have made us strong  for 300 years we have denied the carnal side of our nature  how can we learn to put that aside  well you put a young couple together  and you let nature take its course  for this to work youll have to alter your society too  monogamous marriage will not be possible for several generations  i dont quite understand  a viable genetic base  but the broader the base the healthier the society  so it will be best if each woman bringloidi and mariposan  had at least three children by three different men  i think i could handle that yes  god its so   frightening  repugnant  so its a done deal  and heres my hand on it  now lets go and stake out my three women  send in the clones  i must be out of my mind  starfleet will probably agree with you  excuse me sir captain thank you sir brenna  brenna a word  isnt that just like a man  make grandiose decisions and never consider the poor women  miss odell i  you men draw a mug and solve your problems as the beer goes down  but when it comes to the practical matters  it always falls to women to make your dreams come true   miss odell you wanted a new home  i dont know if i want to be eve  its your choice  if you wish we will drop you off at a starbase  and you can go where you wish  leave my da  if this is going to work  these people will need your strength your guidance  damn  what does he do again   prime minister  sounds important  it is  so he might have more than two coins to rub together  three husbands
