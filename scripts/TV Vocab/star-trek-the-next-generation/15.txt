                captains log stardate 413659  the enterprise has been ordered to starbase 74  in orbit around tarsas iii  a routine maintenance check will be made and certain upgrades done  including the holodeck which has had problems  i anticipate a glowing report  the ship performs magnificently beyond expectations  coming into position  stand by to dock  ready to dock sir  engage mooring beams   and lock off  aye sir  and docking complete  thank you number one  well done  and  well done all  starbase maintenance approaching airlock five  cmdr quinteros permission to board  granted welcome  captain  cmdr riker  youre late we expected you a week ago   we were delayed at omicron pascal  any specific you wish to report  no were very pleased with the enterprise  i knew you would be i headed the team that built her   are these gentlemen the bynars  theyre not gentlemen or ladies  theyre a unified pair theyre always together  this is one zero and this is zero one  they upgraded the computers on the wellington a great job  your reputation precedes you im pleased to have you  a pleasure to work on such a computer  you have 48 hours in 48 plus six we must leave for pelleus v  i thought we had more time  sorry we cant delay you could postpone the work  no we can complete our work within the time allotted  they work very quickly but itll be tight  cmdr riker and i will stay on board  we wont need you until were ready for inspection  the bynars seem perfect for this its the first time ive met them  they have become so interconnected with their planets master computer  that their language and thought patterns  are as close to binary as its possible for organic beings  i wonder how theyll improve a computer as advanced as ours  bridge well i have work to finish then im going to put my feet up  turn on my relaxation light and lose myself in the pages of an old novel  and you youve earned a rest  im not good at organizing my time off  something will turn up it always does  ill be in my ready room  and number one good work  i thought thered only be two of you  because of the limited time we need others   is there a problem  no no problem  then why are you so excited  because we must stacking to reconfigure the computer  to communicate with itself more efficiently and faster  you act like you dont believe them  im not sure that i do maybe its nothing  perhaps its how their species behaves  maybe im going to stroll around the ship  you got the bridge keep your eye on them  yes sir  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  weve been challenged to a game of parrises squares by maintenance   want to join us on the starbase  you have a full team   we can switch off  youll lose the rhythm of the game   i cant persuade you  no but win for the enterprise  rest assured we will be victorious whatever the cost  worf its just a friendly game  work up a sweat have a few laughs make new friends  if winning is not important then commander why keep score  i think hes pulling your leg  believe it or not worf is developing a sense of humor  i hope so for their sake good luck  computer theres a power reduction in section l94 explain  unoccupied sections are being closed down  to clear space in the main computer banks  it is necessary to facilitate the system upgrade  full power can be restored if needed   well what do you think  tell me what its supposed to be  it is an attempt at pure creativity  were investigating if data can be creative  and this is my attempt  with guidance from geordi   i suggested the zylo eggs  is that what those are  keep notes this project may be of interest to future scholars  really  a blind man teaching an android to paint  thats gotta be worth a couple of pages in somebodys book  are you packing to leave for ever  cmdr riker no im just gathering my notes  professor terence epstein is at the starbase  is that someone i should know of  hes the leading mind in cybernetics  he lectured at my medical school  you know the disaster at micromius  since then ive been working on an approach  that combines cybernetics and regeneration  sounds impossible i know but ive found an approach that will work  what an opportunity to have a chance to talk with dr epstein  sorry will id love to chat but i have to go  hows it going  almost done the deviation caused by a probe is corrected  you may use it any time you wish  how much has changed what exactly did you do   enhancement  nothing more   do you wish to try the enhancement  alright what should i choose  computer id like someplace to play music with atmosphere   specify  jazz   era  circa 1958   location  kansas city  no new orleans bourbon street bar in new orleans  around 2 am  program complete enter when ready  very good  very good indeed  now ill need someone to play with a trio  piano bass drums and a bone for me  now an audience  too many  i was thinking of something a little more intimate  great job boys  but computer blondes and jazz seldom go together  now that is truly exceptional  but more sultry  gentlemen if this is what you call enhancement  you have a gift for understatement  whats your name tell me you love jazz  my name is minuet and i love all jazz except dixieland   why not dixieland  you cant dance to it  my girl  whats a knockout like you  doing in a computergenerated gin joint like this  waiting for you  waiting for me you cant be serious  yes will  ive never been more serious in my life  can i ask you a question about the bynars  why not just ask them  what is that highpitched sound you make   its our primary language  how do you process data so fast  we store information with these  we receive it all the time and save it until needed  how did you develop this ability  it happened over a long period of time  a society intermixed with computers has great advantages  and a few disadvantages  everything under control  fine sir i was trying to find out about the bynars   wheres cmdr riker  on holodeck four shall i call him  no ill go down there myself keep me apprised  yes sir  man the chick digs you   what makes you say that  look at her   maybe its my music  well dont give up your day job  too real  you got that straight slim too real is too right   thanks for letting me sit in  aint nothing to it  i have to leave for a while to see to my duties  your works very important to you  it is me its what i am  can we dance once before you leave  sure why not   how did you learn to dance so well  from following you  i can anticipate your lead  so tell me about your work  what is it about it that consumes and enthralls you  interesting choice of words thats exactly what it does   youre very fortunate  i know that  to be exactly where you want to be  and its great that you realize it  id be a fool not to realize how lucky i am  to be on this ship serving with these people  its like a dream come true  just like this  a dream is that what this is  is that what i am  i know youre a computergenerated image but  your smell  your touch the way you feel  even the things you say and think seem so real  thank you  how far can this relationship go  i mean how real are you  as real as you need me to be   astounding  captain   sorry i didnt mean to interrupt  its alright come on in  you picked a wonderful locale  this is something i might have chosen myself  arent you going to introduce me  capt picard this is minuet minuet capt jeanluc picard  enchante comme cest merveilleux de vous voir ici  incroyable vous etes parisienne  au fond nous sommes tous parisiens  oui au fond nous sommes tous parisiens  the spirit of that city can always enchant my soul  i have been hoping to meet you  was i the subject of conversation  indirectly come join us jeanluc   a glass of wine  thank you  will was saying how much he enjoys this assignment  its a credit to you  for a ship and crew to function well it starts with the captain  you set the tone  at this moment it is you who are setting the tone  the sophistication of this programming is remarkable  in what way  the holodeck has given us woodlands and ski slopes figures that fight  and fictional characters with whom we can interact youre very different  you adapt you spoke in french  it was very simple when i heard your name  i merely accessed the foreignlanguage bank   thats very impressive  oui mon chou  now what are you doing  im awaiting inspiration   cmdr data  this is cmdr data go ahead  we have possible trouble in engineering sir  can you be specific  im afraid not its in the magnetic containment field  containing the antimatter can you come up  well go to engineering as thats where the trouble is  dont disturb the captain or cmdr riker yet  aye sir   bridge this is main engineering  this is the bridge   are you running test programs  no  are the bynars  not to my knowledge is there a problem  i dont know theres no one on duty here  we have strange readings from the magnetic containment field  its deteriorating contact the captain im initiating red alert  i cant maintain the containment field  engineering to captain  if the antimatter is released well be destroyed  nothing i do has any effect im losing it  ive rechecked every circuit this is not a computer misreading  computer situation analysis  estimate release of antimatter in four minutes 18 seconds    engineering to bridge  bridge here  alert starbase inform them we are abandoning ship  explain why initiate automated departure sequence  set course and speed to keep maximum distance from any inhabited planets   shouldnt we wait for the captain  weve no time  based on all present information the decision is correct  this is lt cmdr data speaking for the captain  abandon ship this is not a drill  all personnel this is not a drill  i say again abandon ship  all personnel this is not a drill  abandon ship  decks two through four to cargo transporters  decks five through ten  proceed to transporters one two three and four  decks six through 16  proceed to transporters five six seven eight nine  hold your positions please prepare to energize  and energize  decks 29 through 42  proceed to transporters 15 16   this is not a drill   whats going on  please stand out of the way   the ship is being evacuated  why   some problem in engineering  get a security team together  ships log supplemental this is lt cmdr data  i have put the ship on automated departure  and ordered evacuation of the enterprise  everyone remaining is leaving on foot or beaming off  computer where are the captain and cmdr riker  all decks empty  curious the captain is usually last to leave  lets go weve only got 41 seconds  i think were the last  i hope we are   did you see the captain and riker  no are they not on starbase   no  theyre still on the enterprise  yes sir where is your transporter room   we must beam back for them  you havent time  starbase 74 the enterprise magnetic field is regenerating   wait how is that possible  that changes nothing  the captain and cmdr riker are in trouble or theyd be here  look your ship is almost clear  and the boy never found out  yes but not until he came back in with his little sister  i bet they were all smiles  yes but theyd been found out  you handled that in a very thoughtful way  youre good with people dont you agree jeanluc  shes very different from the other images weve met on the holodeck  shes more intuitive  its as though shes been plugged into my subconscious  she knows what i want her to say before im aware of it myself  an understandable progression  computers make decisions based on input  we humans give off a multitude of subtle signs that  that communicate our emotions  its uncanny  i could develop feelings for minuet exactly as i would for any woman  doesnt love always begin with the illusion more real than the woman  jeanluc spoken like a true frenchman   well i think ill be leaving  dont go   twos company  we have time theres no rush   id really like it if youd stay  yes captain stay   this is your diversion not mine  wait we havent danced   i dont dance  then more wine   no thank you  wait  please dont go you cant not yet  whats wrong why cant he leave  exit  captain to bridge situation report  riker to bridge   computer explain red alert  a programmed response  the magnetic field containing the antimatter had weakened   why wasnt i notified  unknown   present condition  magnetic field restored  containment restored propulsion at maximum efficiency   locate data  not on board the enterprise  explain  all personnel except the captain and first officer have been evacuated   evacuated was it that critical  yes   are we still at the starbase  no   position report  coordinates 415926  by 81921 by 312  heading 233 mark 45  destination  planet bynaus in the beta magellan system  the bynars  have the bynars stolen the enterprise  that information is not available  its the bynars youre part of this   yes  you were the lure to keep me here  yes when they saw your interest in me they thought i could distract you   thats riker what about me  that was a fortunate happenstance   what do they want with me  or the enterprise  im not programmed to tell you that  come on number one weve got to regain control of our ship   ok so what do we do  which is the nearest vessel   the trieste  i know it too small too slow  plus its 66 hours away  where are the bynars   i havent seen them  then they are still aboard  we must send a vessel to intercept them at bynaus   they may head for there  what makes you think so  it is the best place for us to start  picard access  captains log supplemental  we now know who has commandeered the enterprise the bynars  we cant contact the bridge  cmdr riker and i will now try to regain control of our ship   this way  to engineering  our first step verify containment and initiate autodestruct  initiate autodestruct  our ship has been commandeered by a force of unknown size and intent  were here alone we must assume the worst  if we dont regain control no one else must have it either  this is the one decision that requires us to be in total agreement  the time allotted concerns me   theres no option  a fiveminute countdown  sufficient to get to the bridge and shut off autodestruct or not  this vessel must not fall into hostile hands  then lets set it and go  recognize picard jeanluc captain  recognize riker william t commander  set autodestruct sequence  does the first officer concur  yes set autodestruct sequence now  autodestruct will detonate in four minutes and 59 seconds  the only place to stop this is on the bridge lets go  what do you make of this sir  a huge amount of data is being stored in the computer   just stored why  another piece of this puzzle   bridge access denied  they locked it   we need another way in  one of us could beam in  it takes too long to materialize youd have no chance  i could beam into the turbolift force the doors  no well beam in simultaneously to different areas of the bridge  with luck one of us will be a distraction  theres only four minutes left  still no response from the enterprise  they would answer if they could someone else has control  do you think i am responsible  responsible how could you possibly have known   my station is on the bridge  you cant be there every second  you are wrong geordi i can i do not need rest or diversion  i should not have been painting i was negligent  its a pointless discussion  you could have been there and it still might have happened  cmdr quinteros you have three ships in here   we need one of them now  were rushing repairs  but its 18 hours before one will be ready theres nothing you can do  set coordinates for bridge  port for me aft for you  youre on pad two  ive set a tensecond delay  set phasers on stun  number one good luck  over here captain  why did you steal my ship  please  try to  help us  cancel autodestruct  does the first officer agree  affirmative  autodestruct cancelled  were in orbit around bynaus how are they  they appear dead lets see if we can get some answers from bynaus  their main computer is off  sensors show all their equipment is inert  they can neither send nor receive messages  they depend on their computer are they functioning  theyre probably like these bynars here dying  why did they steal our ship what is their purpose  they cleared computer space lets see what they stored  captain its enormous every byte of free space is filled  they must have made a coredump from their world into our computer  i cant get in  i wish theyd left a note   maybe they did  minuet  whats this all about  a star in the bynar system went supernova and they miscalculated  the pulse from the explosion was going to knock out their computer  so they had to transfer their stored information  and shut down until it passed  and then reactivate their system and transfer the information back  we have the only mobile computer large enough  so what went wrong why are they dying  the star went supernova before it was expected  you were late arriving at starbase 74  why didnt they say something why didnt they just ask for help  i dont know i dont have those answers  is there anything we can do  yes return the data stored on your computer back to bynaus   how  you dont know  yes if i had the filename but we dont do you  i dont know what you mean  they wouldnt intentionally hide it make it hard to find   it must be right in front of us  lets contact starbase 74  theyre dying they meant you no harm  it was their world they were trying to save  help them will hurry  please  starbase 74 this is the enterprise do you read me  this is starbase 74 what is your situation  well go into that later i must speak to lt cmdr data  im here sir  the bynars have stored some material in our computer  we need to access it  access is available by code or password  i know that data but what could it be  filenames can be anything sir  they want us to find it it would be simple  then a name or a place it could be something personal  in this case in binary language  which is ones and zeros in groups of eight or 16  would they have kept it that simple  try it picard out  thats the file  access the file start the transfer  so much for that idea  let me take the other position  the bynars always work in pairs maybe that is required  it appears to be successful  their systems started up a resident diagnostic program is running  their system is absolutely incredible  our world is reactivated  our people express their gratitude  we will return to your starbase  for whatever punishment your system requires of us  why didnt you just ask for help  you might have said no  there was a good chance wed say yes  our need was too great to risk rejection  and so you stole it  their reason was part of the binary thinking  for them there are only two choices one or zero yes or no  why lure me to the holodeck  because we knew we might die  we needed someone to restore our computer and you did  no one has been hurt you have your planet back in order  we have our ship  well its been some time since i had the conn  but not to worry number one youre in good hands  starbase 74  warp two  engage  everythings under control  uss enterprise has cleared the starbase perimeter   is everything alright  all in order  but i want a complete check all systems all divisions   what about the bynars  there will be a hearing   we knew that would happen  follow me please  permission to leave the bridge sir  permission granted  what is a knockout like you doing in a computergenerated gin joint  youre not minuet  shes gone  i tried variations of the program others appeared but not minuet  maybe it was all part of the bynars programming  but you know number one some relationships just cant work  yes probably true  shell be difficult to forget
