where wesley crusher is about to be tested  for entrance into starfleet academy  and to my surprise ive learned  that my friend admiral gregory quinn is on relva vii  and has requested to be beamed aboard the enterprise immediately   welcome aboard admiral  thank you  capt jeanluc picard lt cmdr dexter remmick  sir  and my staff first officer william riker  chief medical officer beverly crusher  chief of security natasha yar   what can we do for you  i need to speak with you  certainly this way number one  alone   is this a personal matter  official business   my first officer should  alone captain  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  cmdr remmick is with the inspector generals office  hell conduct a full investigation of the enterprise  what are you looking for  i have reason to believe there may be something wrong on this ship  tell me what you suspect  its inappropriate to discuss it now  mr remmick starfleet is counting on you  you will find out what is wrong on this ship  yes sir nothing and no one will stand in my way  and you captain are ordered to cooperate in every way necessary   is that clear  yes sir   mr remmick any questions  no questions sir   get on with your duties  yes sir  weve known one another for years tell me what you believe is wrong  captain it is vitally important that my orders be followed exactly   ill be staying on the ship  as you wish admiral   what is it  what  the unit you just put down dont worry i wont tell anyone  a flux coordinating sensor unit  im oliana mirren another finalist   you must be wesley crusher  yeah  do you know me  i heard there was a very smart very young man  whod be tough competition   you wouldnt be here  if i werent smart i know  but theres a lot more to it than that  youre lucky youve had experience aboard the enterprise   tshanik of vulcana regar  wesley crusher of the enterprise  you do not look as if you meet the age requirements   ill be 16 next month  happy birthday  excuse me  im wesley crusher  mordock  the mordock  the benzite who constructed the mordock strategy   i thought you were in the academy  no  only a hopeful like you  finalists please take your seats  thanks  im tac officer chang  welcome  you are here because you are all top candidates  only one student will be chosen for the academy  youve shown in preliminary testing  that any of you could easily qualify  this may be the most difficult exhausting experience of your life  and the most exciting challenge  expect the unexpected  may you all do your best  may i help you mr remmick  keep doing whatever it is youre doing  theres nothing much to see here commander  were in a standard orbit  the station has to be manned even if its just routine  something i can help you with  when im ready ill want to speak with you  privately  commander just having that guy around makes me feel guilty  whats he after anyway  i dont know but im gonna find out now  come   captain may i speak frankly  always number one  as first officer i should know what you know   thats right  then whats this about  remmicks gonna turn this ship upside down  thats his job  my job is to see that this ship runs smoothly  which you do very well   sir am i under investigation  i dont know   and if you did  i couldnt tell you  i dont understand sir this is extremely frustrating  no less for me  but i promised cooperation and we shall give it  sir   i want answers now  later   you are ordered to cooperate  not now  when it doesnt interfere with my duties  last question on the hyperspace physics test  the matter and antimatter tanks on a galaxyclass starship  are ninetenths depleted  calculate the intermix ratio necessary  to reach a starbase 100 light years away at warp factor eight begin  time elapsed  you now have one hour free before the next test  i must admit wesley you have a very fast mind  it was a trick question with only one answer  yes there is only one ratio with matterantimatter one to one  you both dont know how lucky you are  i cant imagine what it would be like to have things come so easily  i have to push all the way  no oliana it doesnt come that easily  i have to study all the time  its a good thing youre cute or youd really be obnoxious  see you later  did you hear what she said mordock  she said i was cute   is that good wesley  yes  i think  i should apologize captain  no need mr remmicks presence is unnerving  are you available now mr riker  or do you still have duties to perform  im available mr remmick  any problem with using your ready room  no mr remmick be my guest  if you prefer to stand fine mr riker  it wont have an effect on the length of my inquiry  now there are several seeming discrepancies in the captains log  lets go over them one by one  the captains log  yes  to your knowledge has the captain ever falsified a log   have you asked him  right now im asking you  if you want to discuss capt picard ask him face to face  you must answer my questions unless youre covering something up  now there are several discrepancies in the captains log  shall we go over them one by one  proceed  you are saying capt picard had no control over this vessel  he handed it over to kosinski who took it to the edge of the universe  no sir thats not what im saying  kosinski was sent by starfleet to improve our warp drive  according to his own logs  his bridge crew didnt think highly of kosinskis theories  yet the captain gave him access to the engines true la forge  not exactly  one way or the other picard lost control of this ship is that true  yes but thats not how it happened  so the answer is yes  is the captain emotionally and psychologically fit for command  nothing in his history or personality to suggest mental lapses  nothing  not even the ferengi incident on his old starship the stargazer  he was being controlled by a mindaltering machine  without his knowledge  i would call that a mental lapse  ensign what are you doing on the holodeck  i thought you were on relva vii  im finished testing for the day   ive disturbed you ill leave  wait  i thought i wanted to be alone i guess i dont   how is the testing  ok so far  its not the ones ive studied for im worried about  its the psych test facing my deepest fear  im trying to decide what images to bring up   why  i guess i want to scare myself  what do you think bulgallian rats lightning storms  do those things frighten you  sort of i guess  the psych test is no more or less important than the rest  so they said but i cant stop thinking about it  thinking about what you cant control only wastes energy  and creates its own enemy  how can they know what my deepest fear is when i dont  by analyzing your psychological profile  they were accurate about everyone i tested with  including myself  you i thought nothing could frighten a klingon warrior  only fools have no fear  im sorry im asking too many personal questions  it is very difficult for me to depend on anyone for anything  but especially for my life  on the enterprise you do that every day  everyone depends on everyone else to protect them  yes   so you overcame it  no it is still my enemy  we can eliminate three bulky machines from cargo space  excellent number one  captain unauthorized entry in main shuttle bay   unauthorized  who is it lieutenant  computer reads id of jake kurland  bridge to main shuttle bay mr kurland lt yar respond   isnt that area secured  not now remmick   hell take this out  locking the doors  too late hes using the emergency override   smart kid  kid   hes launching  on viewer  lt yar open channel  enterprise to shuttlecraft mr kurland this is capt picard  captain im going to beltane ix  to sign on to a freighter  tell my father im sorry  you can tell him yourself in person   bring that ship back at once  no  i cant face him  im leaving  hes unbalanced the dilithium reaction  ive lost power  all hes got are maneuvering jets  hell enter the atmosphere and burn up  at an altitude of 200 kilometers   probable impact  atmospheric entry 78 seconds   options  tractor beam  no hes too far away for a positive lock  hes out of transporter range  you are completely responsible for his life  either get out of my way and keep quiet  or i will have you removed from the bridge   viewer on shuttle cockpit  visual on main viewer  i cant get the engine started  what am i gonna do  im gonna crash  he needs another 50 seconds for the core to cool down  stay calm jake  well get you back  please help me  its no use captain im gonna die out here   in 30 seconds he can restart  irrelevant sir  a restart will not give enough thrust to escape impact  mr kurland you will not die out there  you will do exactly what i tell you  aim the nose of the shuttlecraft directly at relva vii  aim it at relva i cant thats crazy   do it  but ill burn up   listen carefully this is capt picard and im giving you an order  aim the shuttle at relva  ok   its done  good  now monitor your speed exactly  when it hits point 020 i want you to restart the engine  and when i tell you pull up hard  point 020 speed  captain i sure hope youre right  youl just have to trust me  point 003    six seconds to impact  hold on jake itll be bumpy    restart the engine now  pull up hard  yeah  incredible  how did he do it  he built up speed and bounced her off the atmosphere  mr kurland i assume you can maneuver it home   yes sir  do it  then report to mr riker  yes sir  very original captain  but how did that child acquire access to a shuttlecraft  hes a highly qualified academy candidate  trained in many areas including shuttles  did this full training include discipline  mr remmick young men sometimes make rash choices  mr kurland will receive a strong refresher  specifically in discipline  ill note that in my report  full cooperation number one  you i have a package for operations where is it  end of the corridor on your right 104  excuse me  you blocked my path  you bulgallian sludge rat  im sorry it was an honest mistake i apologize   is there a problem gentlemen  no sir  how dare you i am rondon  you despicable melanoid slimeworm liar  who do you think youre bullying you bumped into me  it was your mistake you were at fault  do you want this to become violent  friend  i like you   a very strange reaction  not really  i saw his hand was webbed the sign of a zaldan  but you became hostile  zaldans are infuriated by courtesy  they view it as a phoney social behavior covering true feelings  congratulations mr crusher  you handled that particular incident very well  was this incident deliberate  its important to know how you candidates deal with other cultures  other species   then it was a test  yes  not all tests are announced or what they appear to be  zaldans have webbed fingers  i wouldnt have passed   youre an android  yes sir  you are programmed to tell the entire truth  there is a problem with this ship mr data  its in the records  somewhere  i need your help to find it  all the records are available to you sir  but this information is very cleverly hidden  your captain is not what he appears to be  do not forget that you have loyalty to starfleet above all else  loyalty is not the issue commander  there is nothing wrong with capt picard or the ships logs  there must be something wrong with your assumption  that is not acceptable mr data  acceptable or not sir it is the truth  just how did this contaminant get aboard this ship  by accident sir  meaning capt picard has no standing procedure for this type of situation  no meaning by accident sir  you dont like me very much do you  is it required sir  how would you characterize your relationship with capt picard  were starfleet officers whove known each other for many years  everything said here is confidential doctor  you can be completely open with me  about what  about how you feel serving with a man  who is responsible for the death of your husband  my personal feelings about capt picard  are irrelevant to this investigation and none of your business  then you confirm the accuracy of the log report  you violated the prime directive of the edo  you interfered with their laws  yes it is exactly as i explained it in the log records  all to save dr crushers son  a crew member was being held unjustly  i stand by my decision  youve talked to every member of this ship  youve had enough time to find whatever youre looking for  are you afraid if i keep looking ill find that youre guilty  all im guilty of is allowing this charade to go on so long  admiral if it is me youre investigating  ask me directly what you want to know  and please tell me what is going on  i need a little more time  how much i wont tolerate my crew being harassed any longer  remmicks full report is almost ready   i want to hear him present it  that is my intention  cmdr remmick report to admiral quinn  on my way sir  this has been a strain on our friendship  i know believe me jeanluc i regret that  but it has been necessary  i cant get it  yes you can dont fight it  relax into it and let it come by itself  no its going too fast  i cant do it  youve got your rotation factor just put in your vector coordinates  time elapsed  congratulations mordock  that was the secondfastest time ever recorded on this test  you all did well  no it should not have been that way  mr crusher helped me  yes i know  an interesting choice mr crusher  especially given how close you and mr mordock are in overall score  you all have an hour to prepare for your last test  the psych test sir  we prefer to think of it as a psychological evaluation  based on reactions to various individual problems  but psych test will do  sir  please sit down mr remmick  proceed with your report  admiral ive done my best to be thorough in this investigation  continue  i couldnt find what you asked for sir  i spoke to officer after officer at length  i pried into the ships logs  yet i found nothing wrong  except perhaps a casual familiarity among the bridge crew but  mostly that comes from a sense of teamwork  and a feeling of family  im sorry sir i did my best  quite   youre dismissed commander  yes sir  my tour in the inspector generals office will be up in six months  when im finished  this is where id like to serve sir  dont judge the young man too harshly hes a good officer  its not him im inclined to judge  dont judge me too harshly either until ive finished  we had to be very sure of you  some of us at starfleet command  became suspicious of certain problems in the federation  what problems  someone or something is trying to destroy  everything weve built up in the last 200 years   whats your evidence  i cant say   too many people are involved  what do you want from me  i dont know if the threat comes from the inside or the outside  i need people i can trust in strong positions in the federation   you have my complete support  thats not enough  i want to promote you to admiral  and i want you to take over as commandant of starfleet academy   the academy  yes   the academy  i need you close  then there was never a problem with the enterprise  no but i had to be sure you hadnt been coopted  greg  this is politics  and  i  im not good at politics  surely there are others who are better suited  alright even if i am wrong and i hope i am  youre still the best man for the job  i appreciate the value of what youre offering  its not a decision i can make quickly  i need an answer soon  alright youll have it tonight admiral  thank you  mr mordock will be finished with his psych test momentarily  are you alright  i will be  youre next  good luck  im here  im ready  maybe they forgot  breathe  gotta remember to breathe  evacuate immediately  somebody help somethings wrong in the environmental lab  help were trapped  i cant move please help me  were gonna die in here  the liquid hydrogens gonna blow  the shutoff valve ruptured hurry up  my legs are crushed you gotta help me  give me a hand  were gonna die  help me  i cant   its too late  30 seconds to sealoff  come on  if we dont get out theyll seal us in to contain the explosion  come on youre not hurt  i cant go through that  yes you can   youve got to  20 seconds to sealoff  come on i cant carry you both  youre not hurt  ten seconds to sealoff  its too late  im sorry   officer chang theres  wesley  its alright  thanks  an excellent performance mr crusher  performance  that was the test  yes  a man could have died  theoretically yes  you had to make a choice and you did  theres no right or wrong about it  your greatest fear has been that you couldnt make that decision  because of my father because cap  because someone made that choice  and my father died   sir  yes number one  mr remmick has left the ship  yes he found nothing wrong on the enterprise  you can inform the crew that admiral quinn is most impressed  thank you theyll be pleased to hear that   so what was he after  they were after me number one  they want me to take over as commandant starfleet academy  congratulations what a wonderful choice sir  youll shape the minds of the future leaders of starfleet  you havent decided what youll do  yes i have number one ive decided im going for a walk  im proud of all of you youve done a superb job  each of you would make a fine starfleet officer  its unfair that only one candidate will attend the academy this year  and a loss to the federation  if the rest of you do not return to test again  mr mordock will be the candidate  his results were slightly higher than mr crushers  congratulations mr mordock  youre the first benzite in starfleet  thank you sir but its not right  it shouldnt be me  wesley lost points because he helped me  he should not be punished for generosity  he wasnt  he lost time but it wasnt only that  candidates thank you  and good luck  i am sorry wesley  its ok you deserved to win  besides youd do the same for me  yes i believe i would  congratulations  well personally i hate losing  so be ready next year wesley i wont be easy to beat  yes sir  are you  feeling better  yes sir  im sorry i damaged the shuttle captain  mr riker said i can help fix it as part of discipline training  i hope you learned that running away solves nothing  yes sir  and i am sorry i messed up  you kept your wits about you dont forget that  no sir and thank you  thank you for saving my life  thats my job young man  yes sir  why arent you in your dress uniform for admiral quinns farewell dinner  i didnt think it appropriate sir  why not  i failed  i didnt get into the academy  i failed you and i failed the enterprise  ridiculous   did you do your best  yes  when you test next year do you think your performance will improve  yes  good  the only person youre truly competing against is yourself  then youre not disappointed  you have to measure your successes and your failures within  not by anything that i or anyone else might think  but  if it helps you to know this  i failed the first time and you may not tell anyone  you   you failed  yes but not the second time  now youll do me the courtesy of joining us at dinner  i have to disappoint an old friend  wish i could convince you to change your mind  ill serve you better here  this is where you belong  if you should need me  ive been playing politics too long  perhaps i see conspiracies everywhere  dont worry  safe travels my friend  set course for algeron iv  course plotted and laid in sir  shall we continue with our mission  yes sir  excellent  engage
