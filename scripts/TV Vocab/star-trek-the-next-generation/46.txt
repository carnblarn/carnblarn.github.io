                captains log stardate 429234  despite misgivings i have agreed to starfleets request  to divert to the braslota system  to take part in a wargame exercise  joining us as observer and mediator  is the zakdorn master strategist sirna kolrami  mr kolrami capt jeanluc picard welcome aboard  captain i bring you greetings from those at starfleet command  would you care to see your quarters  i require little rest  i prefer that we commence with our mission  despite their reputations  this zakdorn does not appear to be a very formidable warrior  in military brinksmanship  individual physical prowess is less important  than the perception of the whole species  for over nine millennia foes have regarded the zakdorns  as having the greatest strategic minds in the galaxy  so no one is willing to test that perception in combat  exactly  then the reputation means nothing  the braslota system in orbit around the second planet  is the 80yearold starcruiser hathaway  he is still your first choice  cmdr riker will captain the hathaway  you have 48 hours to prepare before the enterprise attacks   well experience battle conditions  correct  engineering will disconnect the enterprises weapons  and link the system with a modified pulse beam  hits are recorded electronically  if the computer registers damage it will act accordingly  shutting down the affected areas for the appropriate repair time  additional questions  capt picard it is my understanding  that you initially resisted the request for this simulation  yes  may i know why  starfleet is not military its purpose is exploration  then why am i here  with the borg threat  i decided that my officers and i needed to hone our tactical skills  in a crisis situation it is prudent to have several options  i prefer brains over brawn too  its a waste of effort testing combat skills  its a small part in the makeup of a captain  your objection is noted  let us hope that your distaste for the exercise  will not affect your strategic abilities  mr kolrami when i agree to do something i do it  do you care to surrender now  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  your team should number 40 so select whom you will  except mr data who will serve as my first officer  i had envisaged you defining the crew  here the leader of an away team controls the mission  if you want to judge leadership start at the beginning  very well captain   my what a charmer  doctor  captain he needs an attitude adjustment  the zakdornian culture is replete with selfassuredness  seldom is it undeserved  kolrami is a thirdlevel grandmaster at the game of strategema  another millimeter  thats it a little more there thats excellent   lieutenant  yes commander   youve heard about the simulation  yes good luck  i researched those avidyne engines theyre archaic touchy  anticipating the worst can they be overhauled in 48 hours  ive already taken the liberty of putting together a few necessities  enter  am i disturbing you  just finished  what do you think of the simulation   waste of time  its just an exercise  useless if there is nothing to lose no sacrifice  then there is nothing to gain  you mean besides pride  in this case it doesnt matter i probably havent got a chance   there is always a chance  slim  the hathaways most sophisticated weapons  even in a computer mockup cant defeat the enterprise  well still  youre outmanned outgunned outequipped whats left  guile  join me  the honour is to serve  scan all sectors within three light years of braslota   hows your crew shaping up  one last request  anyone in particular  i would like acting ensign crusher on board for educational observation  thank you captain  well have some time before reaching braslota  would you play me in a game of strategema  although im intrigued by the audacity of your request  i cant fathom why you would wish the encounter   i enjoy a challenge  very well  an opponent of limited dimensions can often be quite diverting  thank you   youre gonna beat him  no   then its gonna be close  no   but you have a chance  no   are you going to show up  sure  kolramis the best just to play him is a privilege  aside from that is there anything to look forward to  no  this is gonna be exciting  against an opponent of approximate skill  strategema can last over 1000 moves  i wouldnt bet on being here that long  i have wagered heavily in the ships pool  that you will take him past the sixth plateau  and if i dont  i will be irritated  forever curious this urge to compete  its a human response  that inborn craving to gauge your capabilities through conflict  there are other ways to challenge oneself  perhaps but they all lack a certain thrill  humans can find it helpful  to have an outsider set the standard by which theyre judged  to avoid deceiving oneself  maybe you should challenge kolrami to strategema  why doctor  when someone is that smug  you occasionally have to deflate them a little  yeah id like to see your neural flex tear him down a peg  to what end  computer actuation positions for strategema  ready begin   come on commander  will  you can get him come on  come on you got him  here you go   thats it  im afraid so   but you only made 23 moves  yes  congratulations  cmdr riker theres your next challenge  away team assembled and ready to transport  i may get there and want to come right home  good luck number one captain  the simulation will commence in 48 hours  there should be some emergency bridge lighting here  not good  youre wrong mr worf its fantastic and its ours  mr worf  sir lt la forge is a superior officer the honour should be his  this is a battle simulation youre my tactical officer  ive discussed this with geordi and we agreed  besides if engineerings anything like the bridge ill be busy  attention crew of the uss hathaway this is your captain  over the next two days you might lose a lot of sleep  but with your skill and stamina well have this lady ready to fly  i want hourly progress reports from all stations riker out  nice job geordi now what are the possibilities of warp drive  not good  there are only a few dilithium fragments left in the holding clamps  also theres no antimatter to fuel the drive  any recommendations   no sir  we havent got a prayer  would you like to transfer back to the enterprise mr crusher  no sir  wes remember our purpose is to improvise  its the effort that counts  open  i believe the rules are understood by all   weapons conversion lt burke  complete captain   signal received locked on  shes been stripped down  the only offensive systems you need will be simulated  whats the zakdornian word for mismatch  challenge we do not whine about the inequities of life  how you perform in a mismatch is what is of interest to starfleet  after all when one is in the superior position  one is expected to win  screen off you have the bridge mr data  aye sir  lt cmdr data im intrigued by your challenge  dr pulaski informed me of your desire to play a game of strategema  but i expressed no such interest  data means he would never have asked you himself  but he wants to pit his skill against yours  play against a machine why should i wish to  i dont blame you its no fun when you know youre going to lose  but i wouldnt lose now youll no doubt tell me to prove it   data you cant let that pass  indeed i  cannot  then you will play for the honour of your ship  the honour of the ship  its your reputation thats on the line  with my knowledge of the enterprises security override  we may be able to convince the sensors  that an enemy ship is approaching  their instruments would lie to them  that might give us the edge were looking for  but what about the viewscreen  if i am successful  the computer will project a false image of the enemy ship  so unless someone runs to a window and looks out  theyre going to fall for it  the linings still smooth  we should be able to do something with the dilithium we scavenged  im sure the systems functional  but without antimatter what difference does it make  i have to return to the enterprise  weve only got 32 hours   this is important  and this isnt  attempt the routeing bypass here  if it works they will be surprised  where am i going to get the opticable  anywhere  captain i left an experiment running on the enterprise   may i go back and shut it down  its that important  it has to be monitored it is my final grade in plasma physics   message from the hathaway sir  on screen  request permission for ensign crusher to reboard  why  apparently he left a very critical experiment unattended   any objection  he should be escorted  and have no contact with anything save his research  permission granted mr burke will you handle that  aye sir  i dont know why riker chose him  just a noncommissioned child  i cant believe i forgot about this i let excitement cloud my judgement  its very dull i spent six weeks setting this up   thats a lot of work  oh no this is ruined  too bad look is this going to take much longer  ill have to dispose of this safely its very volatile   ill beam it off the enterprise  fine just do it  ill transfer it to the transporter room  in the present context what did she mean by bust him up  in her own way dr pulaski was instructing you  to take the shortest route to victory  as opposed to what  ready begin  i cant believe it  a computer beaten by flesh and blood  you advanced quite far against a worthy opponent  thoroughly enjoyable mr data  im at your disposal for a rematch  thank you but what would be the point  how can you lose youre supposed to be infallible  obviously i am not  ensign where is cmdr data  he has temporarily removed himself from bridge duty sir  your crew is excellently trained a tribute to your leadership  although i doubt their extensive preparation will be needed  why is that  i do not expect capt riker will present much of a challenge  mr kolrami may i speak with you in private  i want to know the root of your prejudice for my first officer  captain  mr kolrami you have denigrated and abused cmdr riker  since coming aboard this ship  i would like some explanation  having studied william rikers file prior to this assignment  i have found him wanting  in what regard  his work record is exemplary  but as you know a starship captain is not manufactured  he or she is born from inside  from the character of the individual  my interviews have revealed a man  who displays circumstantially inappropriate joviality  belying the seriousness of his station  dont confuse style with intent  only a fool would question rikers dedication to starfleet  and the people under his command  he is the finest officer with whom i have ever served  we shall see if your faith is well founded  the test is whether the crew will follow where he leads  his  his joviality is the means by which he creates that loyalty  and i will match his command style with your statistics any time  come in please  data  counsellor is something the matter  that was going to be my question  with my repository of knowledge  i expected to perform better against a humanoid life form  some of our greatest advances have come from analyzing failure   while it can be egobruising  i do not have an ego  yes  well a loss can be disheartening   but i do not have a  data  you can handle defeat in two ways  you can lose confidence or you can learn from your mistakes  that is what troubles me i made no mistakes  i have conducted a diagnostic check of all my programs  i am checking the ships computer  is that all necessary  i believe so i have proven to be vulnerable  at present my deductions should be treated with scepticism  thats why you havent been on the bridge  yes the captain would be illadvised to rely upon my judgement  i think youre overreacting im sure youre alright  l however am not sure  easy now   is that it  yeah  good good work  alright hand me that connector on the kit   what is that  my experiment from the enterprise  wes  it deals with highenergy plasma reactions with antimatter  you went back to the enterprise for that   you cheated  no sir you told me to improvise  we need to calibrate a thermal curve to start a controlled reaction  assuming you can can you regulate the reaction  theres just enough crystal left to do it  well channel the reaction through the chips   are we good  better than good  great brilliant its gonna be fun carry on  come in please   alright data enough of this  doctor  how long are you going to sulk like achilles in his tent  im conducting diagnostic  you can sell troi that story but not me  youre smarting because you were beaten well it happens  no doctor im concerned about giving the captain unsound advice  i wish i had never manoeuvred you into playing that game  im sorry  why doctor it is done and perhaps just as well  this has indicated that i am damaged in some fashion  i must find the malfunction  the simulation begins in one hour  youll have warp drive but maybe not what you expect  that deserves an explanation   well have warp one for  just under two seconds  not enough for an escape it may give us strategic advantage   all of this is theoretical  and if it fails to pay off  have you ever driven a grenthemen water hopper   ever popped the clutch  we could stall the hathaway  and the enterprise will pulverise us  let me try to understand you are saying that cmdr data  is suffering from a profound loss of confidence  and that you believe that only i can restore the balance  yes sir  deanna and i have tried but were not getting through to him  dont you think youre overreacting  data is not capable of the emotions youre assigning him  the effects are the same  whether its human emotions or android algorithms  data is not on the bridge and i dont think he will be  until we find some way to address his problem  im less than one hour away from a battle simulation  and i have to handhold an android  the burdens of command  come in please  i require your presence on the bridge  captain with all due respect  you should choose another first officer  you are my first officer  i have not isolated the problem i might make a mistake  yes you might  but that does not alter your duty to me and to this ship  do you know how to formulate a premise   yes sir  formulate this  how do i deal with cmdr riker and the hathaway  i will await your answer on the bridge  and commander  it is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose  that is not a weakness that is life  i believe i understand sir  will you leave your hesitation and selfdoubt here in your quarters  i have several examples of cmdr rikers battle technique  at the academy  he calculated a sensory blind spot on a tholian vessel  and hid within it in a battle simulation  as a lieutenant on the potemkin  his solution to a crisis was to shut down power  and hang over a planets magnetic pole  confusing his opponents sensors  from these specifics what conclusion can you extrapolate  only 21 percent of the time does he rely on traditional tactics  so the captain must be prepared for unusual cunning  counsellor cmdr riker will assume we have made this analysis  knowing that we know his methods he will alter them  but knowing that he knows that we know that he knows  he might return to his usual pattern  wait youre overanalyzing data  one cannot deny human nature  what kind of a man is cmdr riker   a fighter  yes  the weaker his position the more aggressive his posture  and he wont give up  then despite whatever options he is given he must be  the man that he is exactly  is that a failing in humans  you will have to decide that for yourself  on screen  the hunt begins number one  were ready remember enterprise capt riker has never lost  begin now  screen off  set course 223 mark 357  full impulse power initiate kumeh manoeuvre  kumeh manoeuvre why start with such a recognizable ploy  he wants us to reveal our tactics mr worf  counter with the talupian manoeuvre  agreed threequarter impulse full on my command   mr worf prepare your surprise  aye sir  set course 317 mark 73  present minimal aspect ready warp one  optimal spread on simulated torpedoes  romulan warship approaching from astern   what  it came out of nowhere  bring us about maximum shields  full weapon systems open hailing frequency  i cant sir theres nothing there  warp three evasive  disengage weapons and shields reengage modified beam   hes quite good  hes the best  computer reports simulated damage to several aft decks  repair time 36 days  how did he do that  mr worf overrode the sensor codes played some holographic games  mr data input a new code  attack posture circumvental attitude  prepare beams for photon mode  byebye hathaway  computers report damage to the enterprise  theyre moving why not go after them  theyre not through with us prepare warp jump   there are no guarantees  there never are  im gonna trust your expertise stand by for my signal  ready with photon torpedoes  captain sensors picking up a ferengi warship at warp five   did you input that new code  aye sir  mr worf i didnt give you enough credit continue the simulation  divert all power to shields  sever modified beams   engage phasers and target  fire when ready  thats no ghost attacking thats real   we must assist sir  weve no offensive weapons  where are my weapons  unavailable sir we cannot disengage the modified beams   we must retreat  unacceptable  the ferengi have stopped their attack  transport the away team aboard   transporter functions gone sir  shields reduced  use this moment to escape  i have 40 crew on the hathaway  sacrifice them to save 1000  acceptable tactical losses under the circumstances  not to me  notify starfleet hail the ferengi on my word formulate alternatives  as the observer i order you to withdraw  i am the captain  your order is nullified ferengi on main viewscreen  i am capt jeanluc picard  of the federation starship uss enterprise  why have you attacked my vessel  why was your ship combative  with another federation vessel of lesser design  why do you now protect your former target  what is its value to you  our probes indicate you were aware of our approach yet took no action  your answers will dictate our response  we have refrained from launching a counterattack  in the hope of a peaceful resolution  our probes indicate that you are crippled  and the ship you protect has no weaponry  no lightspeed drive and only a scarce crew  this makes no sense to us  unless it contains something very valuable  i am bractor leader of the ferengi attack vessel kreechta  i will have the secret of the other federation ship  surrender it to me  and i will allow your enterprise to leave unharmed  you have ten of your minutes  sir theyre massing a surge of power  were being scanned theyve locked on  data  our shields will not withstand another assault  then there are no options retreat or die  captains log supplemental  due to my miscalculation the enterprise has been subjected  to a surprise attack by the ferengi  i have little time to decide the fate of 40 of my crew  stranded aboard the derelict hathaway  i am open to suggestions  captain we can launch a limited number of photon torpedoes  ive given you my advice the hathaway is expendable   cmdr riker is hailing sir  on screen  have you been monitoring communications  yes sir kolramis right save the enterprise  that would leave you defenceless  when bractor closes in well hit our warp drive take our chances  your what  we have a twosecond warp capability  impossible that ship was rendered warp inactive  i told you he was the best  id like to hear more about this later  right now i have to work something out with mr data  premise the ferengi want the hathaway  believing it to be of value  we must remove it from their field of interest  they will soon locate it after a twosecond warp  there is a way number one can you hear this  yes sir were all here  can you pull a rabbit out of your hat   mr data  on the captains command  we will fire four photon torpedoes at the hathaway  one millisecond later the computer will trigger your warp jump  i hate this plan were not even sure our warp jump will work  if the warp engines fail to function  the result could be unfortunate  very unfortunate  we will be dead  capt riker  i cannot order you to do this  what the hell nobody said life was safe  the advantage is  that it will appear from the kreechtas perspective as though  as though you were destroyed in the explosion  that will deceive them only for a few minutes  their sensors will soon locate us  we only need a few minutes youll prepare a surprise for them  then were agreed  on my mark four minutes  remember if the implementation is off by one millisecond  the hathaway will not survive  thats the one thing were all absolutely sure about  are we ready number one   ready captain  ready captain  good luck to both of you bractor   i will wait no longer picard  the answer is no  your actions have been criminal you will not profit by them   you are a fool  how can you stop us  you believe the hathaway has value  we deny you your prize fire  destroy your own rather than suffer the ignominy of defeat  i did not think the federation had such iron  you had no claim on that vessel it was ours to destroy  as you are ours to destroy  you can try  enterprise targeted leader  leader there is another federation ship closing   a starship  maximum shields  we have been outmanoeuvred retreat  our sensors show no federation starship nearby  of course not that was klingon guile  you made it number one smooth ride  well it certainly was different   well lock on and pick you up  with pleasure captain  i must admit your cmdr riker acquitted himself quite admirably  and so captain have you  my report to starfleet will be most favourable  thank you  initiate recovery procedures continue repairs  plot a course for the nearest starbase  captains log supplemental  with the transporter repaired and my crew safely aboard  we have officially ended our starfleet battle simulation  why have you suspended the game  because this is not a rematch you have made a mockery of me   data you beat him  no sir it is a stalemate  no game has ever gone this high   what did you do  i simply altered my premise  working under the assumption that kolrami wanted to win  he expected me to play for the same goal  you didnt  no i was playing for a standoff a draw  while kolrami was dedicated to winning  i passed up obvious avenues of advancement to settle for a balance  theoretically i could challenge him indefinitely  then you have beaten him  it is a matter of perspective  in the strictest sense i did not win  data   i busted him up  yes
