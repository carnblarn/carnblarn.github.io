                captains log stardate 426864  we are going to starbase montgomery for engineering consultations  prompted by minor readout anomalies   i consider them insignificant  what if youre wrong  sorry but what if it is more than a mere discrepancy  then we have a problem  agreed montgomery can give us an independent reading  even if controls have failed  we can recrystallize dilithium without outside help  dont worry my ego isnt at stake here  we could reprogram the system to correct the variables  thats an option but as were stopping at montgomery anyway  they can do the analysis  i dont recall montgomery being on the itinerary  we could all use a 12hour layover  ive received some personnel transfer directives priority matter  boarding or disembarking  were approaching starbase montgomery  go to halfimpulse power  will you come to the observation lounge when youre done  captain  ive been recollecting the arrival  of a new first officer on board the enterprise  and a manual docking confidently achieved  well i may have been miserly in my congratulations then  so let me make up for it now  the captain of starship aries is retiring  congratulations youve been selected as his replacement  shes in the vegaomicron sector  they have picked up indications of intelligent life  though nothing confirmed  starfleet wants to know more  thats why they want you not for your military proficiency  but for your skill as an explorer and as a diplomat  itll take months just to get there  with no guarantee of finding anything when you arrive  you have 12 hours to consider it  and if its not too premature congratulations captain  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before   establish synchronous orbit  aye sir  montgomery is sending a civilian adviser to brief you on the mission  a personal briefing  an attach with knowledge in the frontier regions  youll find the briefing interesting  i hope its complete my decision will be based on it  cmdr riker to transporter room three  enjoy  ensign  youre right on time commander hes on his way now  dad  youre the civilian adviser and attach  i wanted it kept quiet i didnt want to get you excited  its been 15 years excitement is hardly appropriate  youve done well first officer on the enterprise   quite a feather in your cap  ive worked hard  of course im proud of you son  excuse me i have my duties  when youve settled in we can complete our briefing  have security arrange an escort  aye sir  worf did you hear about cmdr rikers promotion  he didnt know it was his father imagine if it was your father   i never knew mine  nor me  it is a waste of time to think of such things  i wasnt but everybody needs somebody  enough  montgomery didnt have to send all this help  ive checked for anomalous frequencies  so dont waste your time on that  wes are you ok  i was just talking to worf hes really eccentric at times  thats one word for it  he was really upset i mustve said something wrong  maybe hes just not thrilled at the prospect of losing cmdr riker  im not  neither am l but with worf it was something else   somethings really bothering him  think so   female  no  career   family  that is trouble  you choose your enemies and friends but family thats in the stars  so ive heard  kyle riker excuse me ladies  great to see you  kyle been a long time  this is more than a surprise its a total shock   you didnt bake me a cake  youre actually here  that makes two of us how about a drink  how about a kiss   they know each other  no kidding  i know her too but we dont do that  you look wonderful  it has nothing to do with cmdr rikers assignment  no his reaction was the opposite of mine completely unaffected  with all thats going on maybe youre overreacting  really you try talking to worf geordi  he is not normal for worf  there is a predisposition toward hostility in klingons  but worf has been unusually out of sorts  hes never been much on charm  i think we should try to help he is our friend  l for one want to keep him friendly  suggestions  empirical study monitor the subject  right watch the subject for unusual behaviour  wont be difficult  within the norm of klingon patterns discretion will be required  agreed when do we start  we will assist you as needed you found the problem  and you must solve it  thank you  after working out the fuurinkazan battle strategies at the tokyo base  i was asked to come here as an adviser  im surprised how long you stayed out of action  will your father and i were just catching up   you never said you knew him  well it wasnt exactly a secret   it just never came up  sit down son  im ready for that briefing if you are   it was a pleasure  good to see you too graham  are you running for mayor  do pickup work long enough and itll happen to you too   i thought about you a lot  you dont need to say anything  we couldve been great together  possibly   is it true you got married  again   and again  that makes you three for three  im not complaining theyre good men and were all friends  like us  close but different they were all a bit more in touch with themselves  face facts youre crusty  you have a reputation for being hard as nails  but underneath youre not so bad  some of us even love you  and then theres will  then theres will  wesley should be doing this on his own   but he needs his study time  i cant believe you fell for that  he looks perfectly normal to me  in solitude there is nothing to trigger unusual behaviour  good point lets not tamper with the status quo  but that would defeat our opportunity for research  in all probability he is simply lonely  we can relieve his anxiety through socialization  be my guest  excuse me lieutenant  you seem to have lost the will to communicate with others  you have friends here  we  we care about you  geordi wesley and i were saying  with all due respect  be gone  sir  he seems quite sincere in his desire for solitude  seeing is believing  come in   worf  may i have a moment sir   of course what is it  it is very difficult to say  words are not always easy for me  is that earth  yes alaska i was nine years old   that is a fish youre holding  and i didnt even catch it   but it looks like you  hooked it  my father took the rod away he was afraid id lose it  you do not have good feelings for him  no i  well im not sure what im feeling whats on your mind   you are leaving the enterprise  ive been offered a command  i would like to join you  i havent accepted the assignment  but it could be dangerous there may be combat   that is not the purpose  still to die a true hero  worf youve made your point  i know you will do the right thing  finally were alone maybe now we can talk  im here for the briefing  all you need to know is here  this could have been transmitted   ive heard good things about you  then why havent i heard from you  i know keeping in touch is not my strong suit  its a funny thing about being a parent there are no tech manuals  no readouts to get you through you just wing it from day to day  will when your mother died  excuse me ive got to study this briefing  will i came to the enterprise because  considering where you might be going i wanted to  im here with my hand out son  poor guy picked up a flu virus at nasreldine  nasty whats the therapy  tryptophanlysine distillate with a generous dose of pcs   pcs  pulaskis chicken soup   you havent lost your touch  when they hurt i hurt  dr pulaskis greatest medical skill is her empathy   you must be cmdr rikers father  yes how  weve all heard about you and i felt certain things  deanna troi ships counsellor   kyle riker  i thought you should meet  deanna keeps us from deluding ourselves  let me guess betazoid  at your service  i have work to do please excuse me  why do i get the feeling that this is a setup  because youre intelligent wise and quite correct  well ive never been set up better thats for sure  youre also very anxious about something  its will isnt it  youre not as close as youd like  i dont know we both have good taste in women wouldnt you say  id like to help you if i can  if youll let me  fine what do you want from me  i came here to bury the hatchet with my son  only to find out that the ground was frozen solid  you dont seem the kind to give up so easily  i didnt say i was giving up  it would just be nice to get something from him  what do you want  i dont know acknowledgement or  respect is earned not bestowed  respect i dont need that from him  you want him to be proud of you  you take pride in his accomplishments  absolutely  first officer of the enterprise just been offered his first command  yet you covet his success  please hed be lucky to have the career ive had  true youre well respected in your field  i have a reputation for excellence  and false humility  my guess is that will finds you pretty fascinating  candour seems to be a trait he admires  honesty is the trait he admires most  you should honestly consider  why youre so competitive with your own son  competitive maybe in the past  but im here to help will prepare for his first task as captain  will he accept such a dangerous assignment  hell accept it because it is dangerous   how can you be so sure  because i would  and we arent so different will and i  come in  youve seen your mission briefing any questions  no other than one about the ariess first officer  yes flaherty  yes it mentions something about an uncanny linguistic skill  an understatement  the last time i saw cmdr flaherty he spoke 40 languages  as i recall among the more exotic were romulan klingon  giamon stroyerian  he speaks 40 languages  he has this ability of instantly interpreting and extrapolating  any verbal communication he hears  you will find him very useful in vegaomicron  im sure i will  come in  capt picard at last  thank you for the help youve given my son  my only regret is that your reunion marks wills farewell   but hes ready for this command  yes i have no doubt   may i have a word with my son  of course excuse me gentlemen  i wont be pushed into this decision  come on dont you think youre ready for the aries   starfleet does  youre the best candidate  but im here if you need me  ive been alone since i was 15 i can take care of myself  please spare me the pain of your childhood  i hung in for 13 years if that wasnt enough too bad  data what if i missed something  the computer would have corrected it   maybe my inputs were incorrect  data geordi   i figured out worfs problem  you spoke to him  no i accessed the klingon cultural database it took time  ok wesley slow down what is the problem  its the tenth anniversary of worfs age of ascension  his what  the age of ascension a ritual of great significance  a rite of initiation marking a new level of spiritual attainment  what is the significance of the anniversary  its a day of celebration spent with fellow klingons  worf doesnt have any klingon friends   were his friends  we dont practise his tradition  and were not klingons  worf is culturally and socially isolated  what do you suggest we cant invite a bunch of klingons on board  the computer could supply simulations on the holodeck  holographic klingons sure why not  we need only to program in specific details of the ceremony  the cultural database said the klingons family must attend  so were his family well go  i just wonder what kind of party the klingons have   have you got a minute  sure  i wanted to apologize your personal life is none of my business   even if it involves your father  even if it involves my father  did he ever tell you why he never remarried  what woman would have him with an ego like that  i would have in a cold minute  kyle riker was a civilian strategist  advising starfleet in its conflict with the tholians  the starbase he was operating from was attacked  none of the base crew was expected to live and they all died  all except your father  your father alone had the will to endure to face the pain to live  i never knew that about him  ive never seen a man fight so hard in all my life   and you fell in love  yes  and so did he  but marriage was out of the question he had other priorities  his career  if i were you going out on the aries  id jettison the emotional baggage you carry around  the cultural database was specific on the setting  let me guess 20piece orchestra magnificent ballroom formal wear  no theres some unusual test of inner strength  that would entail klingon painstiks  painstiks sounds lovely  enduring physical suffering is a klingon spiritual test  so for worf to celebrate his anniversary he has to be hurt   and we have to witness this  we are his family  come  number one  id be a fool to turn promotion down wouldnt i  i dont know  and if youre asking what to do i dont know that either  i can spell out albeit crudely what youre choosing between  as first officer of the enterprise you have a position of distinction  prestige even glamour of a sort  you are the secondincommand of starfleets flagship  but still secondincommand  your promotion will transfer you to a relatively insignificant ship  in an obscure corner of the galaxy  but it will be your ship and being who you are  it will soon be vibrant with your authority your style your vision  you know   there is no substitute for holding the reins  ill need a little more time to make this decision   find anything yet  not yet   there is nothing to find  no harm in checking i guess  really how would you like them to give the transporter a onceover  no problem were totally shipshape  the point is that they even suspect a malfunction  if i were not a consummate professional and an android  i would find this entire procedure insulting  thanks data  chief could you attend a little party for lt worf at 1700 hours  a party for worf sounds intriguing id be delighted   its a surprise  my lips are sealed  i couldnt leave without saying goodbye  i dont like goodbyes how about until next time  how about until next time  its been a pleasure working with you commander  the feeling is mutual counsellor  im meant to know how everyone feels but  i cant read you right now  perhaps your own feelings are getting in the way  im here to help others sort out their emotions  my feelings are beside the point  not to me our feelings are what make us all human  are you feeling sad  yes i am  so am i  i leave at 2100 hours can i have a minute  ive practised my best academy courtesy now you should go  we need to talk so lower your shields   im asking you to leave or ill  youll what  its a shame theres no anbojytsu ring nearby  really there is deck 12 the gymnasium  we can clear the air once and for all  youre on  scuttlebutt says you wanted to see me  thats right   i thought i knew you  you do as well as anyone  then what is this anbojytsu match with will  youve heard  havent we grown beyond the point of resolving our problems  with physical conflict  i think youre overreacting  me youre the one whos fighting his own son  its not a fight so much as a contest   and if one of you is injured  i know a good doctor   kate  kyle  weve played anbojytsu since will was eight  he knows how to take care of himself so do i  dont take this personally but will is in his prime  and im no spring chicken i know  dont worry hes never been able to beat me  computer is this it  correct klingon riteofascension chamber  is this really necessary  if we want to help worf it is  computer give us klingon personnel appropriate to this event  these images have been specifically programmed for ascension rites  cute bunch  and they use those  those are klingon painstiks  i once saw one of them used against a twoton rectyne monopod  poor creature jumped five meters at the slightest touch  it finally died from excessive cephalic pressures  you mean  right the animals head exploded like  i think thats enough chief obrien   i do not enjoy riddles  you will enjoy this one  im in no mood for trifling or games not today  i know how important today is for you  the anniversary of your rite of ascension   you know about that  all your friends on board do  that is impossible it is a secret known only to klingons  and certain resourceful young ensigns  wesley crusher what does he know about it  just bear with me   where are we going  the holodeck   this is truly trying my patience  i think you will approve   youre not coming in  no  open   an ascension ceremony  happy anniversary  shall we begin  i am ready  today i am a warrior  i must show you my heart  i travel the river of blood  the true test of klingon strength  is to admit ones most profound feelings while under extreme duress  the battle is mine i crave only the blood of the enemy  the bile of the vanquished flows over my hands  thank you   is lt worf alright  hes never been happier   so it was a good ceremony  i didnt stay for refreshments  you dont enjoy klingon culture  im glad that humans have progressed  beyond the need for barbaric display  have they  cmdr riker and his father are in the gymnasium  about to engage in barbarism  dont remind me i do not approve  in spite of human evolution  there are still some traits endemic to gender  theyll knock each others brains out because theyre men  human males are unique  fathers regard their sons as children even into adulthood  sons chafe against their fathers perceived expectations  its as if they never grow up at all  perhaps thats part of their charm and why we find them so attractive  particularly men like cmdr riker  and his father  i hope they dont injure each other  anbojytsu the ultimate evolution in the martial arts  i remember my early lessons  you could never get used to the sightless factor or to losing  true but ive had 15 years to practise  well lets see if youve learned anything  well   youve been practising  and remembering  you should have been the one to die not her  good get it all out  i had you  listen will  you were too young to understand and i was too hurt to explain  you were never too hurt for anything  she was your mother but she was my wife  when she died all that kept me going was you  you had a strange way of showing it  i thought we could talk this out but maybe youre right  maybe i am no father and youre no son  and this fight is all we have left  wait  what now   you cant do that  what  hachidan kiritsu its illegal  youre kidding  all these years thats why i never won you were cheating  it worked didnt it kept you coming back for more  incredible you cheated me howd you get away with it  you were a kid  i knew i couldnt take you but i had to keep you interested   i always hated you for that  damn it  you were barely out of diapers when she died you hardly knew her  id loved her  you carried pain so did i  i should have explained this long ago but it hurt too much  then the wall grew up between us and living together it got bigger  you know  its funny  i can talk to a roomful of admirals about anything in the galaxy   but i cant talk to you about how i feel  how do you feel  how do you think  i love you son   id better go back to the starbase  i know  im glad you came  be careful now ok  montgomerys specialist and analytical team have beamed down  what were the analytical teams findings  they suggested reprogramming the system to correct readout variables  precisely what cmdr data recommended as i recall  at least it gave cmdr riker the chance to consider his promotion  now that hes accepted we can leave him at starbase montgomery   number one  captain  with your permission ive decided to stay on the enterprise   granted  thank you sir   take us out of orbit ensign  breaking synchronous orbit sir  set course for beta kupsic that is still our destination  velocity warp factor five  course and speed set sir  any particular reason for this change of heart  selfinterest right now the best place for me to be is here  engage
