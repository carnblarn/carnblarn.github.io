                captains log stardate 424772  the enterprise has been diverted to the ramatis star system  both sides of a bitter planetary conflict have petitioned starfleet  to transport to their world a mediator they have mutually selected  our orders are transportation only no interference  reduce to half impulse  reducing velocity to one half impulse  come  number one look at this  since we left lima sierra ive wondered how the third planet  could maintain an orbit that is theoretically impossible  but consider this   no degeneration  exactly   why  why i havent a clue  perhaps this facsimile lacks the proper mass  perhaps but if this is an accurate representation  it could explain what happened there  perhaps  well its not a matter of any great moment just a knot i had to untie   what do you want  weve arrived at ramatis iii  oh well  time to leave  standard orbit mr crusher  mr data you have the bridge  transporter room five  im still uncomfortable with you leading this away team  this is not an away team commander i consider it a ceremonial function  for me not to go could be construed as lack of interest   you will be careful sir  cluck cluck number one   sir  youre being a mother hen  i appreciate your concern  actually i look forward to meeting this mediator   we came a long way  they wanted the best  that according to all reports is riva  if he can put an end to all the years of bloodletting   we must do everything to help him  our job isnt to police the galaxy  isnt that my speech but youre right we must not get involved  coordinates input sir  have your sensors indicated any problem down there  none  but youre feeling a certain confusion about this mission  no  yes ive never known you to have such strong emotions  except when you expect battle   i am not expecting battle  then what is bothering you  riva negotiated many treaties between the klingons and the federation  before him there was no klingon word for peacemaker  i see why you feel uneasy  now look this is a simple ceremonial greeting nothing more  alright  aye sir  energize  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  captain this is the enterprise  weve arrived safely number one but so far weve been ignored   ill keep you informed  i would appreciate it  please come closer  before i start is there anything you need food refreshments  thank you no  then proceed  greetings from the united federation of planets  i am capt jeanluc picard of the uss enterprise  this is counsellor troi lt worf  greetings  welcome to ramatis  i have been expecting you   you are empathic  yes  then you know my feelings towards you let me put them into words  i am looking forward to this journey now more than ever  because it gives me a chance to be in your company  i am flattered i too am looking forward to learning more about you  there are aspects to riva we are ignorant of  precisely  our way of communicating has developed over the centuries  and its one that i find quite harmonious  then riva the mediator  is deaf  deaf  born and hope to die   and you three speak for him  yes  we serve as translators we convey his thoughts and emotional intent  i am the scholar  i represent the intellect and speak in matters of judgement  philosophy logic  also i am the dreamer the part that longs to see beauty beyond the truth  which is the first duty of art i am the poet who  artists they tend to ramble neglect the moment  i am passion the libido  i am the anarchy of lust the romantic and the lover  i am also the warrior the perfect line which never wavers  i am that which binds all the others together  i am harmony wisdom balance  remarkable and so these   speak to me  what  speak directly to me  your unique presentation provoked this inadvertent breach in protocol   no insult was intended  then none is perceived  im curious how this rare form of communication came about  the hearing gene is not present in my planets ruling line  not that unusual it is similar to the house of hanover on your earth  who all had haemophilia  or to the leaders of fendaus v who had no limbs  many of our galaxys greatest contributors have been special  my chorus is so attuned they hear my thoughts and translate to you  it is a relationship that goes back centuries  their ancestors provided the same service to my ancestors  your method of communication is elegant and quite beautiful  it takes a fine mind to realise that counsellor troi  this part of you doesnt speak very often  only when the spirit moves me  riva if youre ready the situation on solais v is critical  very well   with your permission captain  make it so  enterprise this is the away team seven to beam up   cmdr riker theyre on board  acknowledged  ensign set your course for solais v   course is set  velocity warp eight   warp eight aye  engage ensign  what is this  riva is deaf these three speak for him  treat them as interpreters address yourselves directly to riva   may i present my first officer  first captain  may i say it is an honour to be on board such a fine vessel  now please continue with the introductions  my first officer cmdr riker  it is an honour to meet you  it is a pleasure to meet such a unique individual  thank you  it is my pleasure to meet you sir  what is that youre wearing  a visor it interprets the electromagnetic spectrum  and carries readings to my brain  without it can you see  no im as blind as a stump  then your visor serves the same function as my chorus  which interprets my thoughts and translates them into sound   yes  and you dont resent it   the visor or being blind  either  no theyre part of me and i like who i am  so i have no reason to resent either   what is your position on the ship  i am the chief engineer sir  its a blessing to understand that we are special each in his own way  yes thats the way i feel exactly  i offer the hospitality of my vessel  at your convenience there is a briefing on the solari wars  ill have you conducted to your quarters  thank you  perhaps if it is not inconvenient counsellor troi could escort me  with your permission  this way  what about you  at times like this we become an encumbrance  so if you have rooms for us  lt worf will escort you  rivas not what i expected   much of what we do is similar  yes in a way it is  we have learnt how to allow people to examine feelings  hidden deep within their psyche  in fact being with you here now is provoking an emotional revelation  you mean some emotion buried deep within your psyche  well not that deep  exactly what are you feeling   cant you tell  some of it  well i feel that soon perhaps after your captains briefing  that you will be hungry and that perhaps we could dine together  and compare experiences   id like that  as will i  will he be with us  well until we find our own method of communication   i look forward to that time  as do i  im sorry data begin the briefing  the factions on solais v are historical enemies  so many have died that both societies are nearly extinct  enough thank you captain there is no need to continue  the specific issues of the conflict have no relevance  so none of the background  would be helpful in understanding why they continue to fight  the conflict will be over some land or wealth  or some other tangible asset  but we both know that is not the case  theyve been at war for so long it has become personal  exactly  the basis for peace must also be personal  this is an historic confrontation correct  the factions have been at war for 15 centuries  whats changed  i do not understand  they have fought for a long time now they want peace  so something about the situation has recently changed  whats the new piece to the puzzle  unknown sir  perhaps theyve run out of people to kill  whatever the reason peace is now preferred  which should make your job easier  well if not easier at least possible for now they are motivated  it doesnt matter ill find something i always have  always  to date i have never failed now unless there is something else  no this is entirely for your benefit  then thank you for your time and effort  i have to get ready for a dinner appointment  if you will excuse me  yes of course  the meeting is adjourned  our mediator is very selfassured well know soon if he can deliver   were now approaching solais v  half impulse  slowing to one half impulse  the sound of this ship is quite remarkable  cant you feel it  it moves through my body like a great pulse   i forget its there  its easy to let that happen  sometimes we must allow the surroundings to flow over us  to dwell on each separate part how it feels to allow it to fill you  how do we communicate you can read lips but i need your words  words  are here on top  whats under them   their meaning  is whats important  yes thats true  we both know  how to express  important words like  dream  being here with you  yes being here with you now is very special to me too  standard orbit  captain im reading laser activity on solais v   how concentrated is the activity  it is localized but very intense  so much for the ceasefire  hailing frequencies  im receiving one side only  this is capt jeanluc picard  commander of the federation starship uss enterprise  if you continue to violate the ceasefire i will abort this mission  you have no jurisdiction here picard where is riva  riva is in charge of the summit i command the ship that brings him  i will not endanger this ship under any circumstances  the other faction is breaking through sir  riva gave his word we would speak to no one else  now who breaks the rules where is riva  i shall summon him  get riva here  counsellor troi have riva report to the bridge  they need you on the bridge now  the ceasefire has been broken  im sure i can resolve that put them on the view screen  viewer on  the quality of transmission is very poor  it is sufficient  brothers your bravery as fighters is known  now you must demonstrate courage in a new way  cease hostilities allow us to meet  the laser fire has ceased  for how long these solari dont seem likely candidates for peace  i need to see a topographical overlay of the battle area  to pick a site for the meetings  then i will need your help in creating the proper setting   worf prepare your security team  yes sir   thats not necessary  but it is prudent  i prefer to arrive with the smallest possible complement  we must not add to an already tense situation  if that is your judgement so be it we will provide whatever you require  thank you captain  there beam us down to that hilltop and inform the factions to join us  the time for killing has come to an end   phasers on stun  you wont need those  im sure we wont energize  yes this will do  we must set this up properly  commander if it is possible  i would like torches here  and here  engineering this is the away team   yes commander  we need your help  i thought you might  we would like two torches head high   and what else  a table here  describe it  threesided and if possible made to resemble indigenous rock   did you read that  yes thats no problem   when will the emissaries arrive  it shouldnt be too long   how long will negotiations take  they wont go quickly  theyre coming commander  the first few minutes will be tense stay calm  do not respond even if you are provoked  well do our best  who is riva  i am riva  be at ease i commend you both  to come here proves not only your courage but your wisdom  please give this conference a chance  i have no magic  you have fought all your lives you have known only  no never death first  dont traitor  no wait  away team to enterprise beam us up now  his words are not mine  please riva  we need you   how did this happen  a surprise  a member of one faction didnt like the idea of peace  i dont understand what youre saying counsellor  riva  go slowly  can you write it out  i am so sorry that your friends were killed  im sorry i dont know what you are trying to tell me  we have to find some way to communicate  data he knows a gestural language find out which one and learn it  counsellor try sickbay maybe pulaski can help  listen to me you are not alone do you understand  we are all in this together now  captains log supplemental  we are monitoring increased military activity on solais v  i fear that without riva we cannot keep the solari  from destroying themselves  hows it going  i have eliminated all but five distinct forms of signing  i will learn them all  computer show me gestural language designation m9  very interesting  a technique of communication that is both silent and covert  it could be very useful  gestures and hand signals predate the spoken word in most cultures  only the leyrons of malkus ix developed a written language first  computer continue presentation  increase  come  hows our mediator  the same hes withdrawn hes very frightened  all his life hes been in control but now he doesnt have any answers  the doctor gave him a complete medical examination  his condition is hereditary  his brain cant receive auditory information  so all the prosthetics and surgical techniques i can use wouldnt work   i dont know how we can help him  i cant do anything  its up to him and hes stopped cooperating  counsellor couldnt you  confidence is faith in oneself it cant easily be given by another  youre right of course  come  captain i have reviewed and stored five distinct signing languages  here is an example  this is blue this is the blue ocean  this is the blue ocean at sunset  this is two people walking on the beach by the blue ocean at sunset  this is two people in love on the beach by the blue ocean at sunset   this is  enough  lets talk to riva  riva cmdr data has learned your sign language talk to us  it was my fault i am responsible for their deaths  in my arrogance i thought no one could harm the great riva   i am such a fool  you are not to blame  what happened appears to be the work of one desperate man  it may not reflect the feelings of others  they were more than my interpreters  they were also my friends  they were a part of me  i did not realise how much a part until now  we have been contacted by the factions on solais  they want to renew negotiations  i cannot i will not  dont turn away you have a chance to make some good come out of this  this could be the catalyst which binds them together  someone else must speak with them not me  not after what i allowed to happen  how could i  but data understands you use him let him explain your words  when data speaks for me can you hear my anguish my despair  data is a fine machine but he cannot replace my chorus  it took years to develop a communication  that cannot be easily replaced  the solari need you  i cannot help them  captain please take me back to ramatis  that is regrettable a lot more people are going to die  its possible to install optical devices which look like normal eyes  theyd still give you about the same visual range as the visor  done  you say almost   how much reduction  20 percent  there is another option  i can attempt to regenerate your optic nerve  and with the aid of the replicator fashion normal eyes   you would see  i thought that was impossible  ive done it twice in situations somewhat similar to yours  geordi it would eliminate the constant pain you are under  why are you hesitating  when i came here it was to talk about modifying this  and now youre saying i could have normal vision  i dont know id be giving up a lot  theres something else you must know this is a oneshot  you cant change your mind or go back  and there are risks  i can offer choices not guarantees  this is a lot to think about  ill get back to you doctor  the captain will take you home  but first hes given me permission to attempt to settle the conflict  yes weve come so far and paid such a terrible price i must try  help me  you would be better off without my help  i have never attempted anything like this before  when dealing with two factions so diametrically opposed  so entrenched in their positions where do you start  you want to know if i had some special technique  i want to know anything that could help  there is no trick i had no magic  what about your chorus  yes my chorus was special  they allowed me to combine different perceptions   so there was a trick  not really  my technique was to look for something no matter how small  that was common to both groups  and then to begin a process where one person or group  expresses themselves to each other   thats very hard to accomplish  yes  but what is even more difficult is to get each side to listen  really listen to each other  and to understand  this isnt going to be easy for me  you are very good with people  but what i do is different  the real secret is turning disadvantage into advantage  why cant you do that  why cant you turn your disadvantage into an advantage  that is interesting  that would give them something in common  i do not understand counsellor to what is he referring  thank you thank me ah  i will have the captain contact them on the planet  and tell them to prepare for your return  no life signs in the immediate area  alright but stay sharp  set phasers on stun  energize  the area is clear commander  put the table over there   engineering this is riker  sir  you can beam everything down now  light the torches to let them know that i am back  it may be a while before they arrive  theyll be more cautious after the last incident  you may leave whenever you choose i will send a message when i am ready  i dont understand how can he mediate without his interpreters   he cant even talk to them  hes going to teach them to sign  yes it is turning a disadvantage into an advantage  learning sign will be a part of their process  of learning how to live in peace  while they are learning how to communicate with riva  theyll learn to communicate with each other  and that is the most important aspect of any relationship  counsellor it took me only moments to learn sign language  it will take them months  time well spent  these people have been fighting all their lives  they know only hatred suspicion and fear  even with my chorus i couldnt have changed their attitudes in a day  we have a chance  they want these talks to be successful  im still not comfortable leaving you here alone  thank you for your concern i will be fine  and thank you for everything  enterprise four to beam up good luck  first officers log stardate  confident that riva will help the solari achieve a lasting peace   coordinates set  take us out of orbit  come   you wanted to see me  yes  you read me well enough  to sense how i feel about you and what you do on this ship  but i wanted to say the words  thank you well done
