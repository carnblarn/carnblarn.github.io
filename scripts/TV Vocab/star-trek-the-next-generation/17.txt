                captains log stardate 414639  we have been asked by the federation  to visit a group terraforming velara iii  communications have been erratic  and there is concern about their welfare  entering standard orbit now  it takes special people to live in such desolation  visionaries who see the planet as it will be  id love to see terraforming in operation   lt yar hailing frequencies  frequencies open sir  velara iii base this is capt picard of the starship enterprise  no malfunctioning equipment sir they are receiving us  velara iii base come in please over  maybe no ones home  we are sensing life forms sir  velara iii base do you copy  velara base to enterprise  yes captain im director mandl and  im sorry about the delay but we werent expecting visitors  terraform command has asked us to see how you were getting along  we were behind but were back on schedule  id like to hope wed be allowed to maintain that schedule  we alarm him for some reason  your staff are well i presume director  understandably tired were working very hard captain  if there is anything we can do  you and your staff are very welcome aboard for a rest   we have holodecks youll enjoy  no disrespect  but we cannot afford the time   channel closed  his fear is escalating  if youl excuse me i must get back to work  i sense deliberate concealment sir   of what  i dont know but its intense  weve heard of your remarkable achievements in terraforming  my crew would appreciate looking around  this is not really the best time we are at a very critical phase  we require no special attention  im trying not to be rude sir  but this is really very inconvenient  he is concealing something its more than being too busy  your announcement about coming down has sent him to a point of panic  well whether he wants us or not  unless youre absolutely refusing us permission to land at your station  prepare to receive our away team  as you wish   counselor youd better go too  aye sir  someone that tense can be unpredictable stay on your toes  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  welcome to velara iii please  remember it as it is now  in two decades you wont recognize it  luisa kim gardener of edens  cmdr riker uss enterprise this is counselor troi lt yar  lt la forge lt cmdr data  arthur malencon hydraulics specialist  and bjorn bensen chief engineer  an android  and thirdincommand of the enterprise  where were you manufactured are there others like you  both matters are subjects of protracted discussion  remarkable  excuse me  we dont get many visitors its exciting to have you here  we werent sure how we would be received  director mandl was less than enthusiastic about our interest  i should apologize for him we are at a critical phase   usually hes charming  well stay out of the way  weve never seen a terraforming station and  we appreciate the opportunity  how much do you know  theories reports but nothing firsthand  wonderful let me show you what we do newcomers find this  the other two are secretive but she is open  what were doing is so exciting so inspiring  we take a lifeless planet  and transform it to an mclass environment  capable of supporting life  terraforming  makes you feel a little godlike  the first phase involves selecting the planet thats very important  it must have the right mass gravity  correct rate of rotation and a balanced day and night  the planet must also be without life  or the prospect of life developing naturally  the federation determines if thats so then we take over  this station is phase two phase three involves water  usually we create basins using hydraulic landscaping  but the water on this planet is subsurface  and extremely high in salt content  were just about to begin pumping and filtering the water  removing the salt oxygenating and replacing  next we introduce microorganisms  and when the process is complete well have a lush arable biosphere  you make it sound poetic  i think its the best job in the universe  the efficiency of your hydraulic landscaping is quite elegant  it isnt yet but it will be  right now im disturbed by the erratic power surges  in the servomechanisms that control the hydraulic probes  could it be caused by the high saline content   that was my first thought but  arthur  the factors do not support that conclusion  im director mandl and im sorry about having been so abrupt earlier  being isolated one forgets the social graces   are you seeing everything  what youre doing is miraculous  what were doing is working a demanding timetable  and there will be no miracle  unless malencon here gets the hydraulic probes back on line  we are set to step up to full conversion immediately  shouldnt you be in the hydraulic chamber  now  yes   alright kurt  geordi  this appears to be the master subsurface pump  youre right very impressive  its interesting the water table is a thin ribbon  between the surface layer and the rocks below  and the two surfaces follow that contour so precisely  the water maintains a consistent depth between them  which would require extreme precision from the probe controls  here we have something that may be of interest to you  a vegetation graph  it is really the key centre for successful terraforming  incredible  its planned month by month decade by decade  every single thing is specific and exact  you see grand romantic concepts  i see unyielding rock under an ocean of sand   commander  what is it deanna  malencon hes in trouble  help  can you open it  its jammed  first officers log stardate 414643  a routine visit to a terraforming site  has turned into something more serious  arthur malencon has been critically injured by a laser drill  which appears to have malfunctioned  situation report number one  were shutting off all power before entering to recover the body  well beam him up to sickbay  but looking at his wounds its probably hopeless  keep me informed   data  go ahead geordi  all set  data the section is powered down  bensen has locked the master servomotor drive  so it should be safe   im going in  i will too  transporter room this is lt yar two to beam up to sickbay  i want to go we should be with him  kurt please come too  transporter room this is riker beam up four at my coordinates  geordi this is intriguing ive seen malfunctions  but this  its almost as if the laser drill seemed to operate  with a will separate from its control console  i cant explain it  the laser blasts seemed to end when the yelling stopped  maybe arthur stopped it only not in time  not possible   then what are you suggesting  uncertain  geordi please return power to the control console in this room   i will reactivate the program  you got it  i am now running the basedrilling program   geordi servos off  they are off   whats happening  too much to explain  can you open that la forge to the enterprise we have a problem  be specific  datas under fire in the hydraulics room  get him out of there   its not working  weve gotta get this door open  data  away team now what is happening   ill beam him out of there  bridge this is lt cmdr data  no need to beam me up the situation is under control   are you alright  yes  well what happened did you set it off  no but the firing program was dynamic  the firing in what way  it adjusted to my tactics it tracked with me anticipating  a fixed program could not do that  someone was controlling the aimingandfiring sequence  that is how it appeared there was a mind working against me  what did you do to this laser drill  a years work destroyed  i had no choice  we were attempting to trace the malfunction when it attacked me  how much of this useless fantasy do i have to listen to  none i have provided temporary quarters for you and your staff  make use of them  youre overstepping your authority you have no right to interfere  an attack on my crew gives me the right   i have a schedule to meet  its on hold  till i have an explanation of this  lt yar escort the director to his quarters  aye sir  go on with your report  the lasers drilling system was reprogrammed sir  when its memory bank received power  it turned itself on and went after me   i was able to cope  not by much from what i saw  i believe it was programmed to destroy any person in that room  certainty speculation  certainty  that would require a master programmers talents  but it was done  so the question is not who  since it was one of the three terraformers  the question is why what are they hiding  what could be so important  that one or all of them could be desperate enough to kill  shall i have them brought in  not yet   malencon  i couldnt save him  the injuries were too severe damage too extensive  the velara iii facility has been powered down  we have a power feed to the lifesupport systems  data i want you and geordi to return for more careful inspection   what are we to look for  evidence of negligence  sabotage whatever the answers there  tasha i want you to provide personnel records of our guests  profiles training im looking for motive intent  the psychological capacity to commit murder  aye sir  we are becoming detectives number one  not much left of this drill  geordi i need some visual assistance  what is it  nothing but basic elements  inorganic  no carbon sandy texture  those flashes are almost musical  i see color variations and rhythms in complex harmonies  speculation could it be alive  how could it be alive its inorganic  whatever it is it could be what they are covering up  and the reason someone killed malencon  captains log supplemental  datas startling discovery of a possible life form  has been beamed aboard so that its true nature might be uncovered  but unlike life elsewhere it appears to be completely inorganic   a test for inorganic life  it has never been done  there are basic definitions for organic life  must have the ability to assimilate respirate reproduce  grow and develop move secrete and excrete   would any apply here  perhaps growth and development   reproduction  yes  those may be basic for any definition of life  organic or inorganic  youre charting unknown seas how do we proceed  lets use the basic scientific method  observe theorize and attempt to prove it activate  lets be sure of what were dealing with is the sample organic  negative carbon negative known life components  substance inorganic   recheck analysis please  rechecking  analysis verified not organic  magnify the screen  factor five  hold surface  factor ten   what are we looking at  its beautiful whatever it is  whats that hum  it started after dr crusher ordered the scanner to magnify  computer demagnify resume normal scan  everyone stand back  step back again  its us   yes were causing it why  unknown  but it is definitely reacting to our presence  perhaps it is picking up the electrical impulse of our systems  the flashes havent changed could the hum be connected to them  computer magnify  what is the magnification   analyze the pattern of the flashes  not repetitive or sequential pattern not recognized  what is the flashes source  unable to specify theoretically not possible from this substance  disregard incongruity and theorize as to source  life  what do you mean a life form what life form  a federation recon expedition certified velara iii lifeless  understandable given this particular life forms novel nature  what is that nature  dr crusher is still making her determination mr mandl  you know the prime directive  are you saying that i knowingly defied it  youre a man obsessed with what you do  who knows what an obsessed man will do to keep going kill perhaps  i create life  i dont take it  you hit him hard captain   what do you think counselor  it was useful  i felt two levels  he did know about the life form but the idea of murder shocked him  the idea or just being accused i cant tell  what about his file lt yar  could he have accomplished the reprogramming data described  mandl has degrees in computer science and artificial intelligence  its possible  what about the others the victim  only the victim had the required expertise  malencon did work where the whatever it is was found  suppressing that knowledge would be motive for murder  if mandl were obsessed enough  terraformers are often obsessive it goes with the career profile  how do you read the designer  she is possessed of highly abstracted reality lovely visions  little data  but you might do better than i  its not locked  mind a visitor  is it true  did you really find a life form  the debate is still going on in some quarters but i think so yes  whats it like  we have nothing we can compare it with its microscopic it  it seems colonial simple but its inorganic  which is why the recon scouts missed it it was not your mistake  everything ive worked so hard for  is falling apart  luisa  its very beautiful  i could arrange for you to see it  perhaps later  captain this is dr crusher youd better come to the medical lab   what is it  geordi observed movement  not movement but a shift in the energy pattern   without external influence  the hum has gone why  unknown sir perhaps it is scanning us  why what could it hope to learn   unknown at this time sir  its changing   i dont see anything  the infrared range is increasing  warning input overload   the hum is back  projecting an energy field  and its intensifying  magnification deactivated  two of them  only life can replicate itself doctor  inorganic or not it is alive  activate quarantine field  quarantine field full  full shield backup  evacuating lab  translation request being patched  translation from whom  evacuate  whats wrong with the translator circuit  bridge this is the captain  request emergency power to initiate lab quarantine seal   do it mr worf  aye sir   whats the problem captain  we know datas discovery is life  but more than that it is intelligent life  how do you know sir  its trying to communicate with us  captains log supplemental  the inorganic life form has taken over our medical lab  its energy is interfering with surrounding systems   can we see into the lab  negative  reducing backup to the quarantine seal might help   doctor  i wouldnt   continue quarantine  aye sir  director mandl and the others are in the observation lounge  counselor i need you you have the bridge number one  director mandl once again what do you know about these life forms   not a thing  enough  sit down lieutenant  you are deliberately evasive and it must stop  you have kept information from me  an alien life form has taken possession of my medical lab   you knew of its existence  yes  is this true you knew there was life on velara iii  i knew that there were random energy patterns yes  but not life not by any definition that ive ever heard  you kept that knowledge from us  no they are meaningless silicon crystals which rebroadcast sunlight  it is a life form and has intelligence   why do you say that  its trying to communicate with us  communicate with you  when did you become aware of them  tell them about the pattern in the sand  yes do tell us  when we first arrived we noticed that in certain areas  the sand had a sparkling effect  like sunlight bouncing off new fallen snow   what did you think it was  we did not give it any thought  picard i must point out again  that we were assured not once but many times  by the best scientific minds in the federation  that this planet has no life no life  and we were not looking and therefore we did not see  alright at first you dismissed it  but then you began to understand that there was something  that was different about them  you cant know that  your apprehension suggested it when we first arrived  tell me about these patterns  at first we thought it was just a natural phenomenon of velara iii  refraction and a thin atmosphere is interesting   but certainly not life  why was i never told about this  because its not particularly important  as the building of the terraforming station went forward  the patterns in the sand ceased being random and became specific  geometric shapes suddenly appearing disappearing  changing location changing size  did you ever feel that these patterns  were attempting to communicate  no never  bensen  i dont know at the time i didnt think so  but now after hearing what you just said  now i dont know  weve regained magnification of the life form its divided again  patch visual to observation lounge  there was no indication of any of this on velara iii  absolutely none  i cannot understand the patterns  neither can i  show me spectral analysis magnification 12k   silicon germanium  transistor material   gallium arsenide  emits light when charged   cadmium sulphide  emits charge when lit  water impurities sodium salts  conductor   but is it alive  probability positive  i wasnt asking you   engineering to bridge  cmdr riker go ahead  the backup on the lab seal is fluctuating sir  i think you should come down  on my way  data youve got the bridge inform the captain  status ensign  the quarantine seal is getting weaker sir  every time i try to redirect backup it goes somewhere else  i think ive no  its locked three people in a turbolift  and two more in the programmers restroom  there is no seal give me lab interior image  yes sir  magnify  picard this is riker  we see it too number one  get that seal back up  no matter what i do the energy goes somewhere else  what if it hits the sickbay  hold on impossible captain we havent got the power  captains log supplemental  the life form which has significantly increased in size  is again attempting to communicate with us  the universal translator is coming on line sir  ugly giant bags of mostly water  bags of mostly water  an accurate description of humans sir you are over 90 percent water  life force do you understand us  we understand  we ask that you be gone we call we talk you do not listen  we didnt hear you we come in peace  ugly bags of mostly water  we try at peace you still do not listen  bags who drill in sand of home have to die  it killed malencon  we see and hear you now we didnt know you were there  you are beautiful to us  all life is beautiful  bag in dome did know caused much death made us kill  war is now with you  the translator is off line sir  can you hear us now   mr la forge  restabilizing captain  sir that chaos when we were studying it in the lab  must have been the energy surge of a reproductive cycle  it is now a colony of single cells organized as a computer   and like any computer  more is stronger  captains log supplemental  we regained visual contact with the lab  but our attempts to restore communication with this microbrain  have been unsuccessful  one thing that is certain this life form has declared war on us  their influence is concentrated in the medical lab  nonessential personnel have gone to distant areas of the ship  any analysis on those bolts of light it emits  a method of reprogramming  each bolt consists of negatively and positively charged ions  a series of program instructions  it has a rapport with our computers  what do you expect it is a computer  have we disabled the medical lab computer console  as soon as data determined its method of operation  captain picking up a decrease in infrared intensity  maybe it reached its energy level  or maybe its not the end  with singlecelled life forms  at least organic ones  cell division is preceded by a resting state  the calm before the storm  medical lab on main viewer lets use this calm  it does seem dormant captain  tasha  set coordinates to beam it back where it came from   coordinates set sir  energize  transporter power being redirected sir we are unable to affect it  life form or not intelligent or not  the safety of this ship is my primary responsibility data  evacuate the air from the lab i want a vacuum there  environmental systems failed to respond to command  it appears the microbrain has interfaced with our computers  if it did try to communicate we didnt understand  it has declared war and we are on the defensive  we are without a lab or a computer it has the power to destroy this ship  and everybody on it   i need your help  unbelievable  it said you were trying to kill them how  i dont know  what was malencon doing when he was killed  there is a thin layer of saline water under the topsoil  he was siphoning that off  perhaps somehow that saline water sustained them  it connected them   i dont understand  they may be like our brain cells  a cell has life but not intelligence  yet interconnected their combined intelligence is formidable  the saline fluid is their circuitry  to prevent its loss they killed malencon  if we had continued to remove that water  we would have destroyed them all  reason enough for anyone to go to war  captain its happening again youd better get in here  itll tear up the enterprise   what can you determine  captain  the microbrain expends a tremendous amount of energy  during its reproductive cycle  yet there is no power drain on our systems   what is feeding it  we found traces of cadmium salts  cadmium converts infrared into electricity   meaning  it might be photoelectric  kill the lights in the lab see if darkness will neutralize it  it still has control of the computer we cant do it  number one lights  the life form must have evolved  where the light got through the sand to the water  drop the water a centimeter below the lightpenetration level  and they starve  killing the lab lights now  its slowing down  its getting dimmer too  more light please  only if you will talk to us  we die bags of water kill us  you are like others  we have no wish to kill you we never have  you do not say truth  we will end this war if you will end the war  darkness death terrible  must go home to wet sand  war over  agreed we will send you home to your wet sand  picard to riker  bring up the lights in the lab a bit  are you better  better  we mean you no harm   do you believe me  yes  good it is important that you trust us  not yet  you are still too arrogant  too primitive  come back three centuries  perhaps then we trust  we understand what you are saying  we will leave you  we will send you home  riker to transporter chief  pick up the coordinates of the jar in the lab  for return to velara iii  coordinates entered sir  riker to bridge  captain were ready to beam it back to the planet   i wish we learnt more about them  in time mr data  when were better prepared  i wanted to create a place where living things could thrive  and all the while i was about to destroy the life that is there   our apologies  and respects   lt yar  coordinates set sir  energize  captains log stardate 414648  i have declared an indefinite quarantine for velara iii  we are returning to starbase with the surviving terraformers  perhaps the lesson we learned from this neartragedy  will prevent it from happening elsewhere
