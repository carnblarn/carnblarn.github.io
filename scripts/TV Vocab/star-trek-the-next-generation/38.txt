                come on in  excellent thats exactly what i needed  mr worf and the good doctor bearing gifts  ale from ennan vi your omelettes deserve no less  this is not an efficient method to prepare sustenance  the computer is more efficient  but it isnt subtle enough for great cooking  it would give you the ingredients  but wouldnt allow for flair or individuality  and flair marks the difference between artistry and competence  historically the breaking of bread  symbolized friendship and community  something weve got away from in the 24th century  youve a practised hand commander   i have my father to thank  your father liked to cook  no he hated it thats why he left it to me  i understand in most human families the woman shares in the cooking  there were only the two of us  i never knew my mother she died when i was very young  where did you get these eggs  on our last stop   at starbase 73  yeah   what kind of eggs are they  owon  for you data something special  dont be afraid they wont bite you  and for you mr worf  a cook is only as good as his ingredients  delicious   number one  go ahead   would you join me on the bridge  right away sir  weve picked up a signal from a federation shuttlecraft  how i thought we were the only manned vessel out here  apparently not  whats it doing out this far wheres its mothership  sensors indicate at least one life form aboard humanoid  perhaps someone to answer your questions open hailing frequencies  communication is not possible the shuttle has no power  set course to intercept  estimate intercept in three minutes  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  captains log stardate 426792  en route to the endicor system  we have encountered a federation shuttlecraft  which has appeared out of nowhere  there are no indications of where it came from or how it got out here   we are closing on the shuttlecraft  thank you on screen  magnify  prepare the tractor beam  target vehicle we will be within tractorbeam range in two seconds  set automatic locking device alert shuttle bay two  shuttle bay two prepare for retrieval procedure  locking tractor beam  number one  youre with me mr worf  dr pulaski you are needed in shuttle bay two  ive been monitoring im on my way  engage secondary tractor beam  its a federation shuttlecraft alright  yet there are no bases or vessels in this area  ncc1701d uss enterprise shuttlecraft 5  ncc1701d uss enterprise shuttlecraft 5  how is this possible  commander come here   captain  yes number one   are you on the bridge  where else would i be  right now you should be in shuttle bay two  why what is it  this you should see for yourself bring cmdr data  condition  life signs are very confusing strong heartbeat but weak pulse   is he injured  theres no signs of trauma  why is he unconscious what happened  i cant say  the readings of his brain waves are very strange  strange in what way   not human artificial  no neither  theyre just out of phase  can you revive him  i wouldnt even attempt it till we get him to sickbay  come on lets get him out  counsellor  i have never felt anything like this before  so its difficult to put into words   that person is you  no  he is as much jeanluc picard as the person im standing next to  beyond that there is very little i can be sure of  i will have to wait until he regains consciousness  i need to know whats on the shuttles logs  aye sir  captain both primary and reserve power has been drained  i need to connect to the enterprise to activate the shuttles systems  geordi report to shuttle bay two immediately  im on my way   ill be in sickbay  captain seen this  looks like the damage caused by an antimatter explosion  it must have been just out of range of the shuttlecraft  data i need those logs  counsellor  well be on the bridge  lieutenant  resume course and speed scanners at maximum range  maximum range  there you go you should have power now  what happened  the polarity is not compatible  thats not possible the connections idiotproof  the power requirements of the shuttle do not match those of the enterprise  we will need a variablephase inverter  to align the power from the enterprise to the shuttle  data what do you think is going on here  not just the shuttle i mean everything  i do not have enough information  im just starting a complete medical workup  his vital signs are distorted  some indicators are depressed others are fluctuating wildly  i cant explain any of it  but he is alive  the restraints are for his own protection  have you determined why hes still unconscious  no but i have been able to rule out any head injury  wake him  what happened  apparently the normal stimulant had the opposite effect  ill have to try something else  alright data  i think ive got it now  that ought to give you something  making this power adjustment is very tricky  by all rights this should blow all the shuttles circuits  perhaps you had better step out of the way  alright but remember youre not indestructible yourself you know  increase the power  powering up  adjust the inverter two percent positive  two percent positive  the right decision is having the opposite effect  yes  i cant think of anything  that would cause the circuit to change so radically  adjust the inverter two percent negative  ok  two percent negative  thats it it shouldnt work but it does  take a look at the stardate    captain  go ahead  weve been able to reactivate the shuttle  the clock indicates that the shuttle is six hours in front of us  captain do you read me  if the shuttles from six hours into the future  then so is the other capt picard  captains log supplemental  part of the mystery has been solved  there are two number 5 shuttlecrafts because one is from the future  six hours to be exact and so presumably is the facsimile of me  try and wake him again   no  its only a sedative  i know dont sedate him let him be please  let him remain conscious  ive never seen anything like this  are you alright  fine save your ministrations for your patient  i want a staff meeting in five minutes  i assume you will remain here  yes i will monitor the conference from here  keep me informed of any changes no matter how small  captains log supplemental  mr data has recovered the logs from the duplicate shuttle  i am apprehensive to play back a log  which will not be recorded for several hours  weve retrieved all we can from the logs  including the last visual records everything else is just a jumble  show me  the distortion is because we had to use a phase inverter  the quality will improve slightly  according to the log the enterprise was destroyed  three hours 19 minutes from now  captain we also have a portion of the last log entry its audio only  captains personal log supplemental  i have just witnessed the total destruction of the uss enterprise  with the loss of all hands save one  me  all attempts to obtain further information have failed  well at least we have something to go on  i dont understand how you could have ended up in a shuttlecraft   while the enterprise was destroyed  nor i  the last thing you would do is leave the bridge during an emergency  yes  alright lets proceed on the premise  that what we have just seen happened  and that in less than four hours from now  the enterprise will be destroyed  and somehow although this is unfathomable  l and i alone escape discussion  our destination is the endicor system  well arrive in three days  the charts show nothing to threaten the ship between here and there  sensors indicated no other vessels federation or otherwise here   data  i have nothing to offer  there is not enough information upon which to base a hypothesis  the shuttle came from up ahead  rather than continuing maybe we should stop here  and let whatever it is out there come to us  we may already be too late  what stopping turning even reversing our course is pointless  when we brought the shuttle and the other picard on board  we committed to a sequence of events which may be unalterable  yes this is not some rock on the trail  which once seen can easily be avoided  this is much more complex  there is the theory of the mbius  a twist in the fabric of space where time becomes a loop  from which there is no escape  so when we reach that point whatever happened will happen again  the ship will be destroyed the other picard will meet us  and we do it all over again sounds like someones idea of hell  well i know this much we cant avoid the future  agreed so lets continue on course  somewhere out there something will happen  a decision will be made and i will be separated from the enterprise  at the time the decision will seem to be correct but it wont be  we have to anticipate and not make  not make the same mistake once  something is waiting for us out there  lets try and determine what it is quickly  doctor  im just beginning to realize how much of the body  is held together by its own internal clock  he was thrown out of time  which caused his body systems to change their rhythms  now slowly as we get closer to the time that he left  his internal body clock is realigning  are you saying that when our time intersects with the time he left  in that instant he will function normally and  and there will be two of us  right now that is my guess  i dont think thats possible  im able to feel much more from him now  his emotions are still a jumble but  counsellor  he desperately wants to leave this ship  captains log supplemental we continue on course to endicor  we are less than two hours away from our rendezvous with ourselves  worf  maximum scan sir nothing unusual to report  if this timetable is correct we could get an indication soon   bridge this is sickbay  yes doctor  captain my patient is more coherent  im on my way you have the bridge number one  how is he  his vital signs are more normal more like ours   he is calmer  hes aware of me  perhaps in some fashion  but he knows where he is whos here  i doubt it  what went wrong you know dont you  what did you do what happened why did you leave the ship  dont turn away look at me  picard look at me   he doesnt understand you  he knows im here  yes but in a nightmare  of disjointed images and halfheard voices  hes in another dimension looking at us across a great chasm  hes feeling remorse at what he witnessed   hes afraid  what is he afraid of  damn you help me why did you leave the ship  its no use captain he cant answer you  when we get closer to his time he may be able to   are you still convinced hes me  yes but youre not convinced  not in the slightest  except for his features there is nothing about him i find familiar  counsellor i want you to stay with him  hell be able to communicate with you before anyone else  i dont know how long anyone could take this anxiety state   there has to be a breaking point  hes handling it very well  he has a lot of anger   because of what he represents  and what is that  doubt hes afraid that seeing him here  and knowing what happened to the enterprise will make him timid  or worse make him hesitate  part of my job is to anticipate problems  my duty is to the captain but first to the ship and its crew  doctor the captain is quite capable of making command decisions  yes for now but this situation has put him  under extreme pressure of a unique and very personal kind  we both know that pressure will only increase  you said yourself that he already has doubt  which is understandable and healthy  and could be potentially paralyzing  if we begin to see signs that hes acting in an irrational manner  i have the authority and duty to relieve him  i dont think that will be necessary  i hope youre right  what force or phenomenon could cause the shuttle  to be thrown back in time  none that we know in theory accelerating beyond warp ten  using the gravitational pull of a star to slingshot back in time  the shuttle doesnt have warp capability  no so some external force was needed  weve never encountered a natural force that powerful  why only six hours why not a day or a year  are you saying there was some conscious mind at work here  theres no evidence either way  the traveller moved through time using the power of his mind  i dont think thats the case here  no  and manheims experiments with gravity and time  were rudimentary and uncontrollable  captain i think this is one instance  where you should suppress your natural tendencies   really  one of your strengths  is your ability to evaluate the dynamics of a situation  and then take a definitive preemptive step take charge  youre frustrated you not only cant see the solution  you cant even define the problem  go on  what were facing is neither a person nor a place  at least not yet its time  youre saying i should shut up and wait  i wouldnt have put it exactly like that   not something i do easily  your persian flaw  yes perhaps it is  captain to the bridge  report  this energy vortex has just appeared beneath us   there was no warning  well at least the waitings over  captains log supplemental  we have apparently intersected with something  it is similar to our tractor beam only much more powerful   bridge this is lt la forge  bridge  the pull on the ship is steady  im holding the engines at 30 percent to maintain our position  transfer engineering control to the bridge  captain there is a consciousness here  not thought more like instinct   what do you think number one  i think were being probed  the beam is coming from the centre of the vortex  sensors show it to be only a mass of energy  what is it trying to learn  i think its trying to determine if we are a life force   well stay and investigate  agreed  unless that was the mistake   staying too long  possibly   we should go now  well  that would be the prudent move  i never thought id hear myself say that  under the circumstances sir i think youre right  but you would rather stay and find out what it is what is its intent   engineering transfer to bridge  mr la forge   sir  take us out of here maximum warp  aye sir ive set the velocity at warp nine  engage  warp engines are at 91 percent   put it to the wall mr la forge  aye sir  i cant hold it  the engines cant handle the strain  all stop   mr la forge  im reengaging warp engines  status  all decks have reported no damage no injuries  the hold on the enterprise is strong  im at warp seven just to maintain our position  everything we do tightens its grip  lets see what we can learn launch a class1 probe  aye sir  mr worf  that was personal  the power drain needed to hold this position is enormous  how long can you maintain it  just a few minutes then well have to shut down  captain some kind of energy  just surrounded my patient   is he alive  yes  arm the photons mr worf lock on the centre of the vortex  photon torpedoes on target  hold for my order  like a rag in a dogs mouth  i am now at maximum warp  its you captain it was the entire ship  but now it has focused its attention entirely on you  captain i cant hold it if we dont shut down right now  hold this position  counsellor if i were to leave the enterprise  would its attention still be focused on me  yes i think it would  youd never survive  but in those few seconds the enterprise might break free  thats what he thats what the other picard must have thought   where are you going  you have the bridge  youre leaving the ship  we may be on a road that has no turns  hes very agitated  i must get to the shuttle  i know do you know where you are  the enterprise  but youre only vaguely aware of it and me do you know who i am  no you dont do you  i must go   release him  do you know what youre doing  no release him  security to sickbay  no security disregard that order and clear all personnel  repeat all personnel from shuttle bay two  i dont want any distractions  you stay here   youre leaving the ship  i must   why  the energy in the vortex wants me   youre certain  yes  its an entity a life form  it recognizes the enterprise as an entity with me as its brain  shuttle bay two  whats your other option  this is our only chance  if i leave  it may be distracted long enough for the enterprise to escape  no if you leave the enterprise will be destroyed remember  you saw it happen  if i dont leave the ship the enterprise will be destroyed  if thats true then help me we both want the ship to be safe  but there is information i dont have   its me  you  captain were about to lose warp drive   understood  understood  when you say it wants you do you mean still you and not me  youre confusing me  were almost out of time i must get to the shuttle  wait you can ill let you  but first tell me what was your other choice  stand aside  you must tell me what was it  you dont know what im talking about  youre locked into a single intent unable to change  unable to alter any of your previous actions  i must leave theres no other way  there must be  one but it would never work  what is it what would never work  i have to leave  what was the other choice we cant fight we cant go forward  no we cant go forward that would destroy the enterprise  was that it was that the other choice   i must leave  no  capt picard  i cannot allow you to leave  before we can go forward  the cycle must end  dr pulaski report to shuttle bay two  bridge  number one were wasting energy trying to escape  set a course for the centre of the vortex  mr la forge on my command all the power you can muster   yes sir  were going in   yes  course set sir  now everyone hold their position no matter what  engage  capt picard  shuttle bay two the other picard and the shuttle are gone   explain  they just vanished   whats our position  we are back on course to endicor  stand down from red alert  all decks have reported in no damage no casualties  you have the bridge number one  a lot of questions number one damn few answers  maybe none of it was real  perhaps we were all part of a shared illusion  or maybe he was thrown back in time  so that we would be able to take another road  make a different choice  they say if you travel far enough you will eventually meet yourself  having experienced that number one  its not something i would care to repeat  ill be on the bridge sir
