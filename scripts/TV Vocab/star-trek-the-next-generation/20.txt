                captains log stardate 417982  we have been ordered by starfleet to the lorenze cluster  to investigate the disappearance of a light cruiser uss drake  which was there trying to unravel a mystery of its own  this began when recent longrange probes  indicated that all intelligent life on the planet minos had disappeared  number one  nothing the drake arrived at minos then wasnt heard of again  mr data  citizens of minos gained fame during the erselrope wars as arms merchants  they manufactured highly advanced weaponry   yeah for which side  both  we are approaching the planet minos sir   standard orbit mr la forge  aye sir standard orbit  what happened to the drake happened quickly  or rice wouldve reported again   you know him  from the academy   tell me more  able good officer  how would he react under stress  rice is confident to the point of arrogance but hes usually right   a risk taker  really  heres an example a final test in advanced navigation at the academy  provides the students with three options  rice rejected their options and offered one of his own  thats taking a risk  he got the top grade and now that test has four options  in a difficulty such a man would act aggressively  agreed  commander werent you offered the drake  yes  you gave up your own command for this assignment  i thought it would be more advantageous to do a tour here  captain readings correspond with the probes findings  no signs of intelligent life forms vegetation and animal life only  what happened to all the people   war  disease  a dissatisfied customer  in every war natural disaster even the most virulent plague  there are always survivors  we are being hailed  how can that be from an uninhabited planet  sensors indicated no intelligent life forms  correct sir something has scanned our language banks and is hailing us  on main viewer  whoever you are wherever youre from greetings  welcome to minos the arsenal of freedom  im capt jeanluc picard of  if you need a little something special  be it for one target or multiple targets  we got it youll see it here on minos  where we live by the motto peace through superior firepower  who are you  to be totally armed is to be totally secure  remember the early bird that hesitates gets wormed  a recorded message sir  minos the arsenal of freedom perfection in advanced weaponry  versatility  weve triggered something left from the erselrope wars  when the arms business was booming  so lock on to my signal and beam on down  because we dont just provide weapons   shut that off  we provide complete weapons sys  its a heck of a sales pitch  if an automatic message system is functioning  other systems could be still operational   weapons  possibly   we must go down  prepare an away team  lt yar data   i recommend a minimum complement  i wouldve thought otherwise  we keep the first party small and mobile  until im confident whatever killed the inhabitants isnt still there  ok  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  captains log supplemental  an away team is on minos  to investigate the disappearance of the drake  although there are no signs of intelligent life from this planet  im far from certain that it is devoid of danger  spooky   riker  this is the bridge  well start a pattern search from this point  keep this channel open  aye sir  commander our communications are being monitored  by whom  since there is no intelligent life the question is by what   captain  we heard number one  well try and track it down from here   tritanium its melted  what could do that  i dont know but its beyond our technology  over here  wow   never seen anything like this  its undamaged  maybe a demonstration model for some potential buyer  maybe lets spread out a little  commander riker this is ensign tsu  im monitoring a slight energy buildup near your position   i cant pinpoint the source  give me a direction  east of your position ten meters i will continue monitoring  i cant see anything through here the underbrush is too thick  hello  commander riker  rice where did you come from  i was over there  we were worried i shouldve known youd pop up   how are you cmdr riker  what about you no word nothing   how many are with you  two others wheres the drake  number one a word  we have some information you should be aware of  ensign tsu  sensors indicate lowlevel energy readings  but the only life signs are your teams  you copy number one  understood  you look strange paul  i was injured getting here   do you need medical help  no  whats your purpose here  cmdr data lt yar  sir other than ourselves i am picking up no life signs here  i know  riker you didnt answer me who sent you to look for me  your mother shes worried about you  tell me about your ship riker its the enterprise isnt it  no the name of my ship is the lollipop  i dont know that ship  its newly commissioned its a good ship  refresh me would you riker whats its size its complement   who is here with you  what arms are on the lollipop  paul i will only answer your questions if you answer mine  why do you want to know about my ship   were friends arent we  old friends  our top speed is warp three whats yours  is then the drake has not been destroyed   the drake  yes your ship   of course the drake  where is it   classified  classified  please its important our survival depends on knowing   whats the armament on your ship  ten  ten i dont understand ten what  six  cmdr riker your answers make no sense  you havent used my first name once paul you remember it dont you  you dont do you because you dont exist youre a fake  youre an image of the original arent you answer me   report number one  the image of rice has been replaced  by something hovering several meters away  number one get your team back up here  prepare to beam up  commander  whats happened number one report  he cant answer captain  cmdr riker has just been encased in some kind of energy field  is he alive  unknown  captains log supplemental  a kind of weapon which for a time took the form of capt paul rice  has enveloped cmdr riker  transporter room have you locked on to the away team  i am unable to lock on to cmdr riker   ensign tsu situation report  previous energy readings are gone  data have you managed to assess cmdr rikers condition  he appears to be in some kind of stasis  theorize mr data what would be the purpose of such an encasement  typically the purpose of such an enclosure is for storage  which would suggest what  that someone or something will soon be along to collect him  im coming down dr crusher meet me in transporter room three   mr la forge you have command  aye sir  whatever happens your responsibility is to the ship  understood sir  captain i take exception to you beaming down  noted  is it just riker  yes apparently hes been confined inside some sort of force field  energize   any changes  we know what it is   any life signs  he is alive  what appeared as capt rice is an intelligencegathering device  used during the erselrope wars  probably developed here  it projects an image of someone the subject trusts and gets information  if its found out it encases the subject  for more detailed interrogation later   clever  can you remove it  possibly but i need the exact frequency  and i dont know the risk to cmdr riker  we have no choice its interrupting the transporter beam remove it  this will take some time sir  i am picking up energy readings  captain la forge here sensors show energy readings in your area  doctor over here   oh no  doctor  this one is different  its anticipating data i need you  set your phaser on kill ill lead left you get it  captain  dr crusher  captain picard   i have a malfunction  enterprise this is yar  mines out too  the weapons must have disrupted our communicators  keep working ill look for the captain and dr crusher  my arm  how bad is it  its bad  come on  alright dont worry well get you out of here  enterprise this is the captain two to beam up  enterprise  enterprise come in  data lt yar  why arent they working  i dont know but dont worry  as soon as they realize our communicators are not working  the sensors will find us and geordi will beam us up  now just you hold on  im sorry about this  hold on it wont be long  i must keep conscious  data i cant find them  step back please i believe i have found it  data   all vitals returning to normal  good  now geordi can get us out of here cmon  the captain and dr crusher cant be far away  sir im reading life forms on the planet  all five members of the away team  good they must have freed cmdr riker  transporter room get a lock on the away team beam them up  shields just came on deflectors also up  im picking up an object off the port bow its firing  red alert battle stations  we cant beam anyone up with our shields in place  phasers ready photon torpedoes standing by locking on target  correction target has disappeared   give me a full scan  scanning nothing yet  wait something dead astern   power to shields  object firing  return fire  no use its gone again  aft shields weakened our shields cant hold stand up much longer  this is chief engineer logan are we breaking orbit  i need to know now  ships log supplemental lt la forge in command  i cannot beam up our team due to an attack on the ship  even worse chief engineer logan is coming up  and hes not paying a courtesy call   why are we still in orbit  we have to hold out  if we can disable our attacker even briefly  we can beam the away team up  if we follow that plan well lose the enterprise  in view of the present crisis you should relinquish command to me   no  i outrank you  mr logan im in command  the captain did not anticipate the enterprise would be attacked  if he had would he have left command to you  if he had he wouldnt have left the ship  an object to starboard sir heading toward us  lock phasers fire once its in range  locking in the object has vanished  phaser lock lost   starboard shields weakened  its cloaked itself  you cant beat this thing we must break orbit now  worf analyze its firing pattern  maybe we can anticipate its location  aye solis correlate the trajectory of energy bolts with attack path  ill compute the optimum spread to hit it   right  lt la forge geordi  i know you want whats best for the enterprise so do i the best  the best thing mr logan is for you to return to your duties  im in charge until relieved by cmdr riker or capt picard  youre ignoring my greater rank and experience  not at all in fact the opposite im counting on it  i need you back in engineering to get me all the emergency power you can  the more power we get to the shields the longer well be able to hold out  now mr logan  worf have you got a lock on it yet  its impossible to be sure  maybe you should wait here while data and i search   im groggy but ill be alright  im getting energy readings  look out  well do it just like before  it has a deflector shield  the product continues to upgrade and improve  concentrate fire to collapse its shield  commander well need you too  now  youre right they keep getting better  the weapons are appearing at intervals of precisely 12 minutes  i dont know how we handle the next one  were not going to wait around lets find the rest of our team  we seem to be in some kind of underground structure  but i dont see any  no dont sleep   im tired  come on stay with me  cmon now stay awake thats an order  i mustve lost a lot of blood  ive stopped the bleeding  no theres another wound my leg  not to worry everything is going to be fine  now this is going to hurt a bit  ive heard that before  doctor stay awake come on  theres a lot of blood what do i do next  the wound needs a clotting agent  i couldnt find your medical kit  those roots what are they  roots what these  break off a piece and taste it dont swallow it   very bitter  apply some to your hand   is there a color change  its turning yellowish  good now spread as much of it as you can onto the wound  now stay awake youve got to help me  i need your help  alright now listen  your patient has lost a great deal of blood from multiple lacerations  the patients going into shock  so what do i do  elevate the legs and try to keep her warm  good alright  stay with me  keep talking  you didnt happen to bring a blanket did you  no  im going to look for a way out  now you keep up your end  stay awake  alright its risky but a shot in the dark is better than nothing  lets see if we can get lucky  i cant seem to pin down the pattern   there  sorry sir i shouldve seen that  no youre doing fine  program laid in phasers and photon torpedoes ready  ok mr solis bring her about to 23 mark 185  aye sir   fire now  phasers and photons firing  we missed  number four shield buckling  number three shield near failure  this is engineering i cant hold power level much longer   do something  backup systems overloaded  backup systems failing  la forge this is logan tell me something  mr logan report to the bridge  on my way  deflectors are breaking down we have less than one minute of reserve  were getting out of here  lt solis set course 315 mark 007  course set   youre leaving them  speed warp five  warp five aye  engage  hold course and speed for 28 seconds then come to a full stop  mr logan had we stayed we would have been destroyed  were carrying over 1000 people i have a responsibility to them  what about your responsibility to the away team  i have a responsibility to them as well  mr logan you are going to take command  of the saucer section   backup crew to the main bridge  youre separating  yes i want you to take the saucer section to starbase 103  you cant fight what you cant see you cant see that thing   maybe we wont have to  risky  yes thats why were going to separate  worf solis tsu to the battle bridge ill join you in a moment   secure connector levels  aye sir  come in  lieutenant i need to speak to you  were about to separate i dont have much time  i know  but as counselor i must evaluate the emotional fitness of the crew  and you sense im nervous  well youre right counselor deep down im shaking  were going into battle  and theres a good chance well be blasted to pieces  im taking a huge risk and many lives are at stake  so yeah im nervous did you expect otherwise  not at all youre under tremendous pressure   more than youve ever experienced  you think ill crack  on the contrary you should be proud of the way youre handling command  youve kept cool taken charge and made some very difficult decisions   then what did you want  battle bridge is ready  however deflectors are not yet at full efficiency   lets get them there mr solis  aye sir  ill join you shortly la forge out  did you hear the uneasiness in his voice  solis is doing well  yes but he isnt handling the stress well   both he and ensign tsu are young  theyre good  but they lack battle experience  theyre worried about making mistakes and need encouragement  what do i do  just remember its you they draw strength from  they look to you for guidance and for leadership  help them  show confidence in them  like captain picard showed confidence in me  right  i understand thanks counselor  prepare to initiate separation sequence   all decks report ready  on my mark  now  main latch bags to zero  main latch retraction 1 18 initiate  static charge compensate  separation complete  lt solis lay in a reciprocal course for minos warp five  course set  on my mark engage  we seem to be well sealed in doctor   no exits  none that i can see  if you find one go  tired of my company already  beverly  im tired i need to sleep woke up too early  talk to me stay awake tell me something  tell me about  those roots how did you know their medicinal value   my grandmother  your grandmother was a doctor  no  she was a botanist then  no she helped to colonize arvada iii  arvada iii  thats such a tragedy did she survive  yes  once the medical supplies had run out she had to use what was at hand  so she learned all about roots and herbs and then taught it to me  you were part of that colony i didnt know that  but there must be a lot of things about you i dont know  quite a few  what now just a minute heres something odd  its glowing   what is it  i dont know its  its covered up im just clearing away the dirt  its a viewscreen  it seems to still be operative  its a tracking device of some kind  tracking what  there are three moving indicators possibly the away team  beautiful isnt it its the centerpiece of the whole unit  whos that  a projection  its the automated salesman who greeted us on the enterprise   what unit  the echo papa 607  our proudest achievement  the ultimate in weapons system technology  thats behind the attack on my people  impressive demonstration isnt it  demonstration it tried to kill us  versatile powerful and easy to use the 607 does it all  its modules can gather information neutralize ground personnel  even destroy enemy space vessels  the enterprise is one of those things after my ship tell me  of course  i am programmed to answer all questions about the unit  i can talk terms arrange for delivery whatever you need  it doesnt understand anything other than what its peddling  the 607 represents the state of the art in dynamic adaptive design  it learns from each encounter and improves itself  what went wrong where are its creators the people of minos  once unleashed the unit is invincible  the perfect killing system  too perfect you poor fools your own creation destroyed you  what was that noise  the unit has analyzed its last attack  and constructed a new stronger deadlier weapon  in a moment it will launch that against the targets on the surface  abort it  why would i do that  it cant demonstrate its abilities unless we let it leave the nest   they are down there sir  lets clear that away  if datas correct the next one should show itself in two minutes  captain can you hear me  yes were here  are you alright  dr crusher is seriously hurt  we cant contact the enterprise the communicators are out  yes ours are out too  those devices are part of a system located down here  another is being released watch it  we know captain  theres nothing to hold on to we cant climb down   im surprised they survived  i can go   how  jump   data its over ten meters  1175 sir  data you may be sturdy but youre not indestructible  i can safely traverse the distance  captain datas going to join you down there  be my guest   data  at your service captain  lets find a defensive position if datas right  he usually is  well have company any minute  and this time i dont know how were going to stop it  ships log supplemental  lt la forge in command of the stardrive section  after separating from the saucer we have returned for the away team  unfortunately i have only one option left and its a long shot  shields and deflectors are up  ensign when i order the shields down you have one responsibility  locate the away team and grab them   you may only have a few seconds  approaching the planet sir  things are gonna happen fast  just keep alert stay calm lets focus on what were doing  you know your jobs youve been trained youve been tested  youve earned the right to sit in those chairs  that sound again   another weapon  we must stop the system   i need the program schematic  youve got it  is it possible to readjust the targeting sequence  absolutely it wouldnt be much good without it   give it a new target  it must be specific  itself or its own power source  that explosion would destroy this cavern and everyone above  watch now this is the fourth and final projectile  the echo papa series 607 is about to complete this phase of its mission   we could split up  why   confuse it delay it  it would still get us   one of us might get out of range  out of range  forget it these devices wiped out the planet it doesnt have a range  what does that leave us  right thats what i thought  we could look for deeper cover   you got any ideas  none   give me some options data  why dont you just shut it off   is that possible  why not its a machine isnt it  shut it off  why you havent seen half of what it can do  weve seen enough   so youll buy it  yes youve made a sale   you wont be sorry  good end the demonstration  done   number one  right here  that was close  la forge everythings alright weve neutralized it  great to hear you captain ill get back to you   phasers at readiness  shields at full power  heading 25 mark 300  well be heading deeper into the planets atmosphere  yup and losing maneuverability so hold on tight   aye sir  you hope our attacker will follow  im counting on it scan for any air disruption or vortex  it cant cloak its turbulence how fast can you get a phaser lock  fast  hull temperature  power to deflectors steady as she goes   hull temperature 2500 degrees  deflectors nearing overload  sir helm going unresponsive   can you compensate  yes   hull 3000  maintain heading  were about to lose number four deflector   3300 degrees  deflector four is now inoperative  turbulence to starboard   there he is  scanners locked   weapons locked  fire  got him  shields down  locked on to away team beaming them home now  come to 40 mark 65 ahead one third and assume a standard orbit  standard orbit aye sir   relinquishing command captain  as you were  sir  when i left this ship was in one piece  i would appreciate it being returned in the same condition   do you concur number one  absolutely sir  lt solis plot a course to rendezvous with the saucer section  sickbay reports dr crushers going to be fine  course plotted and laid in  engage
