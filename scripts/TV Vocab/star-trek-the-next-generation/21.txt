                all hands this is the captain  the sun in the delos system is undergoing largescale  magnetic field changes producing violent gigantic flares  we shall study this star at close range  even though well have full deflectors  the closeness of this event and its severity will create problems  intense magnetic fields  have a disruptive effect on electrical systems  we can expect communication interruptions  and temporary loss of other systems  as a precaution were going to yellow alert stay sharp everyone  attention all decks yellow alert  engineering this is lt cmdr data  bring all systems on line and direct power to the shields   all sections secure  lt la forge   course is set  half impulse   aye sir one half impulse  on main viewer  mask out the photosphere  magnify quadrant 07  magnification factor 12  ive never seen anything like this before  the violence of those eruptions is awesome  im reading an unusual number of sunspots and eruptive prominences  the magnetic field is extremely irregular  captain deflectors are being hit by huge bursts of xrays  look  my console seems to be overloading  the xray burst is disrupting systems  im adjusting deflectors to compensate  engineering increase power to forward shields  forward deflectors on line sir  status report  all systems operational sir  captain the level of tension on the ship is mounting  understandable  if we are to investigate we must get closer   move us in closer  aye sir  this is the captain we will be pushing the shields to the limit  but we are getting a splendid view of this phenomenon  captain ive intercepted what appears to be a distress signal  let me hear it  this is tjon  im on the ornaran freighter we have a serious problem we cant fix  we need help  the transmission is coming from a freighter  in orbit around the fourth planet in the system  however the receiving station is on the third planet   open hailing frequencies  hailing frequencies open  unidentified freighter this is the uss enterprise  may we be of assistance  whoever you are yes im having trouble navigating  we cant maintain a steady course please help us   cant you enhance the frequency  too much interference  set course to intercept with the freighter warp two  maintain yellow alert  i cant control the helm any longer im losing orbit  were heading into the atmosphere please do something  were going to burn up we havent much time  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  it is a freighter very old  captain our sensors are being affected by the sun flares  take us as close as possible to the freighters orbit   moving in  there are six life forms aboard  the freighters orbit is decaying  how long before it loses integrity  a matter of minutes  unidentified freighter this is the uss enterprise  this is the ornaran freighter sanction  put this on the main viewer  the visual transmission is still breaking up  sanction this is the enterprise   what is your situation  not so good  what is the problem  this is the enterprise with all this interference  it is difficult to copy your transmission  if you all talk at once it is impossible  now please say again what is your situation  i am tjon captain of the sanction  at last how can we help  weve lost i dont know something  i am not able maintain this orbit  nor can i use the main thrusters  its all you know dead i guess  its all shut down  well that is a little vague what is the computer analysis  our computers not working very well  data can you tap into their computer and clarify this  i will attempt it sir  captain the tractor beam is available if you want it  we could pull them out of orbit before they enter the atmosphere  freighter were going to pull you out of orbit  hey thats great  captain the freighters orbit continues to deteriorate  the solar flares are interfering with the tractor beam  were unable to attach the tractor beam because of the solar activity  i understand thanks for trying  i have determined what is malfunctioning on the freighter   we have analyzed your problem  great  your ship uses an electromagnetic coil  to constrict the exhaust flow   this coil is misaligned  really   do you have tools to realign it  i dont think so  we can provide them with a temporary substitute  our ships stores contain a coil   can we beam one over  yes  captain were beaming over a replacement coil  thats great and thatll fix us up  yes once its installed  right  and how do we do that  what is the matter with these people  how can he be captain and not understand  captain how long have you been in command  seven years this is my 26th voyage to brekka  you dont know how to align a control coil  its never come up   can anyone else over there do it  hold on ill ask  sorry   nobody knows anything about it  id better go over with a team  i strongly recommend against anyone from this ship beaming over  the solar interference is too great  it has entered the atmosphere disintegration is imminent   were running out of options  lets get them off  tjon stand by to beam over  if you think thats best  unless you have any other options yes i think thats best  whatever you say  i cant maintain a positive lock  unusual em burst sir readings off scale  sanction were having difficulty getting a fix  have them go to their transporter room  perhaps i can link two transporters and use the increased power  worth a try  go to your transporter room contact me from there  right enterprise its right next door  but what makes you think our transporter will do the job  im going to interconnect them   i didnt know you could do that  hurry   were on our way  they wont make it  capt tjon doesnt sound like he cares   how much time left  one minute 28 seconds   capt tjon  were in the transporter room  activate your transporter set coordinates 9703 mark 268  did you say 286 or 886   mark 268  got it  sir the hull temperature of the freighter is passing 3000 degrees  whats the holdup  were establishing the link right now  were ready  all six of you get on the transporter platform  on my signal energize  ive got their signal interlock complete  energize on my mark four three two one energize  did you get them off  they stayed in the freighter but they beamed over their cargo  cargo are those people crazy what could be so important  sir the freighter is disintegrating  their lives are in danger and they beam over cargo i dont understand  the freighters hull temperature is approaching critical  unbelievable  weve got to beam those people over now   beam the cargo to a hold  aye sir  sanction get to your transporter no forget that  lock on to any life form get them here  trying sir   the freighter is going down  youre out of time   six life forms but no solid lock  we have no choice energize   where are the other two  the lock didnt hold   reestablish  its too late  number one  two are lost sir  but we saved four  im cmdr william riker of the uss enterprise  im sorry we were unable to rescue the other two  we did everything we could  if you had come instead of sending your cargo youd have made it   the cargo where is it  you did save it  yes its in one of our cargo holds  it seems more important to you than your comrades  the cargo may we see it  follow me  thank you we thought we had lost it  careful with your choice of words tjon its ours not yours  we paid a fair price  you offered a price we have not received it  you accepted our goods in trade  then where are they   tell me  thats not our problem  the barrel is not your property  its simple the goods were never delivered  they were destroyed  hence the deal was incomplete hence the felicium remains ours  we need it  commander i request you transport my associate and myself to brekka   with our merchandise  yes  get them out of here but the barrel stays  theres no reasoning with you  langor you expect too much from them  you always have and youve always been disappointed  you didnt pay for it therefore its not yours  damn you sobi  stop this now  security to cargo bay 11  behave yourselves gentlemen  escort our visitors to the observation lounge   a natural electrical charge  formidable  yes and a difficult weapon to confiscate  i have never seen humanoids with that power i wonder how it evolved  the strong magnetic field of their sun  could be i wonder how much power they produce   or if they need to recharge  how do i defend against them   theyre a threat  i dont know   but id better be ready  precisely lieutenant  we have to resolve this there isnt much time  what can you offer  everything we had was on the sanction  then its going be difficult to accommodate you  solar flares increasing shields are shaky but theyre holding  maintain   how are our quarrelsome guests  theyre waiting for you sir  data what information can you give us about the inhabitants  the only recorded contact with the delos system was 200 years ago  a scout ship reported two inhabited planets  one on the verge of acquiring space travel  odd that in two centuries neither advanced much further  sir i find it strange that none of our visitors feels much remorse  about the two passengers who perished  yet that cargo is a source of great anxiety to them  yes lets pay a call get some answers number one mr data   la forge you have the bridge  aye sir  captain may i present sobi and langor from the planet brekka   and tjon and romas from ornara  sorry we couldnt save your ship  tell me you could have repaired it  yes  we have only two left neither works properly  they are critical to our survival will you fix them  mr data  our computer has downloaded the specifications  for the magnetic coils the freighters depend on  assuming the malfunction is similar replacements can be fabricated   instruct engineering to proceed  aye sir  now as for our cargo   our cargo captain  wrong sobi  my first officer has said that ownership is in dispute  but this must be settled  by whatever legal machinery exists between your societies  you dont understand this is a matter of life and death  why is that what is this cargo  medicine  indeed  our planet is in desperate need people have a lethal plague  the cargo is the only hope of life for our people  is that so  yes  you must think us heartless but look at our side of it  the plant which yields felicium grows only in remote areas of brekka  it must be painstakingly cultivated harvested purified  a complex and expensive process  that single shipment represents an enormous investment  we cant just give it away  we paid for it we ask for only what is ours  that is your viewpoint ours of course differs  you will hold to that position  i am constrained to abide by the terms of our agreement   you condemn us to death  romas  you disgust me lf you could see the suffering the plague has caused  well you are going to  when you see what it does to us  romas are you and tjon carrying this plague  yes  every ornaran does  then you may have brought it aboard  was there a medical scan  unverified the solar flares could have caused a malfunction  med alert dr crusher to the observation lounge at once  you find us well i trust  as far as i can tell  your physiology is different than ive ever encountered  but i detect no dangerous virus or bacteria  i assure you were in perfect health   we are not we need our medicine  our medicine   we paid for it its ours now  enough  of course you are right doctor   could we leave now  i see no reason why not  escort them to their quarters   doctor  captain could i speak with you  in private  not right now captain   whatve you learned  the brekkians appear uninfected  the ornarans show all the symptoms but i cant find a cause  perhaps it was filtered out by the transporter  theres no record of it but the flare activity  might have caused a malfunction in the biofilters  are they going to die  i need to check but my instinct says no   do you think were in any danger  again i need more time  there are some missing pieces to this puzzle  whats missing is some compassion  are we losing our professional detachment  perhaps  but im developing a very active dislike for these brekkians  understandable  captain you must give us back our cargo  i cant do that  why it belongs to us   the brekkians claim its theirs  they lie  maybe so but it is not my decision  we need some now i dont care if its your decision get us some  this is happening to thousands more on ornara  please understand the size of the problem  you dont need it the brekkians dont need it our people do  if you dont give it to us you will murder not only us  but an entire civilization  i im sorry i do not mean to insult you  im feeling very shaky  we cannot hold out much longer  they believe it will help that in itself might control their symptoms  ill talk with the brekkians  thank you captain we appreciate anything you can do  may i say how impressed we are with your ship and all its facilities   thank you  and its crew  everyone is so efficient and professional  ive come to seek your agreement to an ornaran request   we cannot agree  wait  let the captain speak we want to be reasonable  the two ornarans are ill and insisting they need the felicium  that is not surprising  would you give them enough for their own immediate needs  captain we brekkians are in business  we are not in the habit of giving away that which hasnt been paid for  youd see them die rather than share it  we want to be fair  we agree to permitting them two doses for immediate use  no charge  ill let my medical officer handle it  you wont mind if were present while you open the cargo  what does that device do  this measures the individual portions  whats the dosage   very potent substance  weve improved our distillation process over the years  years ago the same amount of felicium  would have filled five rooms this size  now with our improved processes  this barrel contains over four billion doses  i estimate four billion  thank you mr data   how long is the dosage effective  it varies  but never more than 72 hours   and then the symptoms return  yes  there is no cure for the plague  but felicium inhibits the sickness with total efficiency  allowing the ornarans to lead normal lives  an unusual disease  virulent extremely persistent yet i cant isolate it  the plague has baffled doctors on both planets for 200 years  weve therefore concentrated on treatment  finding new ways to improve the potency and purity of felicium  no doubt you applied technology from other industries  to the refinement of this product   we have no other industry  none at all  we dont need any the ornarans provide us with everything we need  in exchange for this  fascinating  your society is dedicated to the production of a single product  for which you have no use but which the ornarans cannot live without  one of lifes little ironies  but one wed be fools not to take advantage of its  mutually beneficial  the ornarans provide us with the necessities of life  and we provide them with the necessities of living  it is a fair exchange   interesting relationship  ill take that to sickbay   can i help  no  hurry up   youre feeling better  yes thank you  im fine now  come  i may not know feliciums effect on ornaran physiology  but i know how to interpret physical reaction  are the ornarans recovering  tjon and romas are feeling fine in fact too fine  feliciums a narcotic  then tjon and romas and everyone on their world  is a drug addict  its a fascinating tale weve come across  youve piqued my interest please continue   data what have we got  several thousand years ago  the two planets took different paths  ornara became technologically sophisticated brekka did not  by a devastating plague  their advanced technology could provide no solution  somehow and there is limited information on this point  a cure was found in a plant indigenous only to brekka  which rejected all attempts at cultivation on ornara  a trading situation developed which still exists   a nice deal for the brekkians  and the ornarans   without the medicine theyd die  no they wouldnt  despite what the ornarans say it is not a medicine  it was a medicine but it cured the plague 200 years ago  the plague is irrelevant now it doesnt exist  why are they so desperate for felicium  its an addiction  the physiological and psychological need is very real  thank you   what are you going to do  theres nothing i can do  you dont think drug addiction and exploitation  is sufficient cause to do something  this situation has existed for a long time  these two societies are intertwined in a symbiotic relationship  with one society profiting at the expense of the other  thats how you see it  i can synthesize a nonaddictive substitute  which will ease their withdrawal symptoms  no i cant do that either  you cant let them have the felicium  why because it offends against our sensibilities  it is not our mission to impose federation or earth values on others  in this case captain i disagree 100 percent  captain im receiving a call from ornara  i think i can put it on the viewscreen  do it  im margan  are my people on board your ship  some of them yes  may i speak to them  yes lt yar have the ornarans brought in no wait  i dont want them to have access to the bridge  we will contact you in a few minutes  i will continue this in the guest quarters commander doctor  data i can understand how this could happen to the ornarans  what i cant understand  is why anyone would voluntarily become dependent on a chemical  addiction to drugs is a recurrent theme in many cultures  wesley no one wants to become dependent that happens later  but it does happen so why do people start  on my home planet there was so much poverty and violence  for some their escape was through drugs  how can a chemical substance provide an escape  it doesnt but it makes you think it does  you have to understand drugs can make you feel good  you feel on top of the world youre sure of yourself in control   but its artificial  it doesnt feel artificial  until the drug wears off  then you pay the price  before you know it youre taking the drug not to feel good  but to keep from feeling bad  and thats the trap  all you care about is getting your next dosage  nothing else matters   i guess i just dont understand  i hope you never do  lt yar were ready in the guest quarters  tjon do you have it  yes it is here but  youve got to get it to us tjon please  were dying down here its worse than its ever been before  im doing everything i can you see what happened was  stop i cant listen any more  tjon there are so many people here so much suffering  we need the medicine youve got to get it to us i cant go on  help tjon  please  im sorry  you will take us to our planet with our medicine or he dies  i have no choice  we were sent to bring felicium back  the suffering on my planet is too great people are dying  it doesnt matter whether were entitled to it we must have it   let him go  you will take us there now  or give us a shuttle but we must have the medicine  if you refuse this person will die  i will not be coerced  i will do it  i will kill him  no you wont youre not a killer  help us please  im not sure that i can  my insides are still shaking but im alright  capt picard could i see you a moment  ill stay here  come with me doctor this could be interesting  we have thought about this a great deal  we both feel deeply about what is happening on ornara  and although it will cause hardship to us and to our people  we have decided to give the felicium to them  they can pay whenever they are able  we dont want to be responsible for their suffering  there goes the other shoe   they know  what do they know  that ornarans no longer have the plague  that felicium is no longer a medicine  so of course they are willing to give this shipment  they dont want the ornarans to lose their addiction  they dont want to lose their only customers  how would they have known all that unless they once had the plague too  they were infected they used the felicium to cure themselves  but their ancestors realized that it was a narcotic  they broke the cycle of addiction and never told the ornarans  they let them believe that without the felicium they would die  i think its worse than that  i guess this refining process of which you are so proud  is only to increase the potency of the felicium and tighten your grip   what are you going to do  will you tell them  no im bound by the rules of the united federation of planets  which order me not to interfere with other worlds other cultures  if i were to tell them id violate the prime directive  but you are talking to us about it  this is information you already know and so nothing has changed  if you cant interfere you are going to allow the ornarans  to have the felicium   yes i am  no dont do it  jeanluc this is not a symbiotic relationship  this is exploitation pure and simple  the brekkians have caused this suffering  only to make their pitiful lives easier  and all of it based on a lie  no deny them this shipment it is the least we can do  from the moment they agreed to give the felicium my hands were tied  you are absolutely right captain its not your business  are these the spare parts for our freighters  they look complicated  are they already   aligned  right  youd have to ask the captain  capt picard weve arrived at ornara and assumed standard orbit  acknowledged thank you  captain please my planet is suffering  we beg you to give us our medicine  the matter is decided  youre beaming down to your world with the felicium  great   i knew it i knew youd help us  we thank you  dont thank me sobi and langor decided to let you have it  well discuss the payment terms later  theres no reason to deprive you of your needed medicine  thats terrific  im sure we can come to a fair deal for payment  may we beam down with you and discuss it   of course  you are quite welcome on ornara  we appreciate your hospitality  captain we appreciate your gift of the coils  once our freighters are fixed everything will be back to normal  no  no  the coils stay here  what about our freighters  you want to repair them youll have to do it yourselves  we cant  if you dont help us our ships will soon be inoperable  quite possibly  if you withhold the coils  youll be disrupting the stability of both our planets  and interfering with an agreement that has lasted for generations  what of your prime directive  in this case the prime directive prohibits me from helping  thats absurd  you did not think so when it favored you   do you want our world to suffer  no i dont want that  without the freighters there will be no more shipments of felicium  we will die  you must trust yourselves there are other options  ensign prepare to beam our guests and their cargo down to ornara  captain i hope you realize what youve done to us  of that you can be sure  good luck  main bridge  when the felicium runs out  the people of ornara will suffer horrible withdrawal pains  no doubt but they will pass  that seems so cruel we could have made their burden easier  could we have  perhaps in the short term  but to what end  hold  beverly the prime directive is not just a set of rules  it is a philosophy and a very correct one  history has proved again and again  that whenever mankind interferes with a less developed civilization  no matter how well intentioned that may be  the results are invariably disastrous  its hard to be philosophical when faced with suffering  believe me there was only one decision   i just hope it was the right one  and we may never know  resume   la forge take us out of orbit  destination sir  i dont care get some distance between us and this system  aye sir  course 970 mark 318 speed warp three  where will that take us  the opraline system  an interesting choice why  curiosity weve never been there  engage
