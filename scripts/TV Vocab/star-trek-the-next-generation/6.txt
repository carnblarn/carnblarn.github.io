                captains log stardate 412631  we have rendezvoused with the uss fearless  a starfleet propulsion expert and his assistant  are beaming over to conduct tests on the enterprises engines  they have made similar adjustments on two other starfleet vessels  i dont understand your concern  theyre not authorized to make alterations  they will run tests on different ways of entering warp speed  and different formulas wheres the harm  its the specs kosinski sent us theyre gibberish   gibberish  mr data would you explain  we put mr kosinskis specs into the computer and ran a test  there was no improvement in performance  so explain why the same tests on the uss ajax and the fearless  resulted in an increase in propulsion  our engines are new sir top condition  the tests on older ships may have fixed some inefficiency  bridge from transporter  two from uss fearless are ready to beam over  stand by mr rikers on his way  aye sir  youre concerned about these tests  yes sir  if i may ill ask counselor troi to look these visitors over  very good  welcome aboard mr kosinski im cmdr william riker   where is the captain please  hes engaged in other duties  his engines should be the captains concern  they are which is why the first officer  is responsible for an engines performance  guided of course by a chief engineer lt cmdr argyle  nice to meet you i appreciated receiving your specs  to which you have many questions  aye i have  you sir are  mr kosinskis assistant my actual name is unpronounceable by humans  youre from tau alpha c thats very distant  all approved and described in the starfleet communications  i will set up in the engine room  our chief engineer will show you the way  no need i know my way around starships  one thing kosinskis not hiding is bad disposition  agreed also hes arrogant overbearing selfimportant  and very sure of himself and his ability   and his assistant  hes the puzzle  with most life forms i can usually feel something  i may not be able to understand it but i feel something  if only a presence  with him nothing empty space  its as though he isnt even here  something about this concerns me i can point to no reason yet  stay concerned please  the safety of the enterprise may be entrusted to these two  space the final frontier  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise  its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before  i shall begin my first test in precisely 15 minutes   why is this child here  hes doing a school project  there are some questions first  to save myself time let me ask those questions for you  you received the information from starfleet  fed it into your computer as precisely as humanly possible  you did a controlled test  then to your astonishment nothing happened  so you said whats going on this doesnt work  kosinskis a fraud  i have had this conversation  on other vessels  they didnt understand it why should you  youre saying its unexplainable  im saying im not a teacher nor do i wish to be one  i have neither the inclination nor the time  you have all the time you need  i dont think you understand it has been approved by starfleet  it hasnt been approved by the chief engineer or me   i didnt know that was necessary  now you do  perhaps i should speak to capt picard  if you like it wont change anything   how basic shall i be  ill leave that to you  would you get on the auxiliary panel  to save time my assistant is going to lay in my base formulas  more rapidly than any human being could even myself  here then in the simplest possible terms is what i do  this warpdrive system has been tuned only in the grossest sense  at least according to my standards  what i do is specific thank you  well sufficient to say for now that these symbols  something troubles you with the way this is configured  how about it now  yes  but shouldnt these be connected  here  and here  now will it do what kosinski says it will  it has a chance  it might work better this way  yes  view this screen as we consider this  now is this merely mechanics or is it nature were dealing with  what else than nature are the elementals of space and time  you are trained in the system you go in a straight line  competent perhaps innovative in a minimalist way  but what i do is not the end of the process it is the beginning  so do i go back to the fearless  which i left with a more efficient warpdrive system than i found  or do you cast off your ignorance and let me continue  could this damage our system   its meaningless  should we let him try  let him try dont talk about me as if im not standing right here   we might as well let him try  you are too generous  boy dont play with that  engineering is ready to proceed  engineering this is the bridge its your call  do this one just like the last time nothing changes  commander ill make my preliminary adjustments at warp 15  and complete them as we achieve warp four  engineering to bridge did you copy that  affirmative number one are you ready  we are  la forge set in warp 15  warp 15 sir  engage  alright here we go  what are you doing  captain were passing warp ten   what is our velocity  its off the scale sir  reverse engines  captain no one has ever reversed engines at this velocity  no one has gone this fast reverse engines   all stop  reading all stop sir  position  calculating it data what do you read over there  malfunction i trust  position mr la forge  weve not only left our own galaxy but passed through two others  ending up on the far side of triangulum  the galaxy known as m33  thats not possible data what distance have we traveled    i cant accept that  you must sir  our comparisons show it to be accurate  and i calculate that at maximum warp it would take over  300 years to get home  captains log stardate 412632  this will be a rather unusual log entry  assuming starfleet ever receives it  as ive already informed my crew  a surge of power during a warpspeed experiment  has sent our starship hurtling out of our galaxy and past another  taking us over 2700000 light years in a few minutes  message on this has been transmitted to starfleet sir  which they should receive in   mr data  sir   capt picard i presume  we dont know what happened  the truth is i made a wonderful incredible mistake  just explain what brought us here  as the power grew i applied the energy asymptomatically  i anticipated some tilling  that was my error using the bessel functions at the beginning   what is he saying number one  it sounds like nonsense  but considering  considering where we are  we must assume it isnt  can i do something to help  i can call my mother shes a doctor  theres nothing she can do i need to rest ive been away too long  is what happened to you part of what happened to the ship  please believe me i mean no harm to this vessel or those in it  is mr kosinski like he sounds a joke  no its too cruel  he has sensed some small part of this  that space and time and thought  arent the separate things they appear to be  i thought the formula you were using said something like that  dont ever say that again  not at your age in a world thats not ready for such  such dangerous nonsense  i suspected that this rate of speed was possible  but at this level no never  were going to need new definitions new parameters  perhaps you could call it the kosinski scale  why not yes of course  since im the one whos made the warp barrier meaningless  captain this must be a special thrill for you   thrill  as an explorer  in three centuries weve charted just 11 percent of our galaxy  and then we accomplished this  yes but isnt the real point can you do it again  can you get us home  well of course i can ill just do what i did before  coming riker  cmdr riker will join you in a moment  comment is invited counselor  hes convinced hes right i have no doubt of that  can you allow a man whos made one mistake  into a position where he may make another  captain if this guy cant get us back who will  captain why not avail ourselves of this opportunity for study  theres a giant protostar in the process of forming  no other vessel has been out this far  spoken like a true starfleet graduate   it is tempting number one  aye sir it is  but as they say youre the captain  if kosinski can get us home  starfleet can use his technique to bring back a pure science vessel  do even more  tell kosinski to get us out of here  aye sir  do you realize how many great advancements of mankind  have been tied to speed  this is a moment in history right here right now  and your names will be forever linked with mine  excuse me cmdr riker  i dont think he did this it was   not now  standing by  but sir i was watching his assistant  im sure this is fascinating wesley but not right now  aye sir   come on  hes too tired   why dont you do it by yourself  yes why not   no i will help  as you wish  ive laid in the reciprocal course back captain  tell the captain i am ready first officer  ready for you to engage captain   as before begin at warp 15  warp 15 sir  this isnt working   all stop  answering all stop captain  according to the instruments our speed never exceeded warp 15  all stopped sir  yes  but where is this place  where none have gone before  captains log stardate 412633  instead of returning to our own galaxy  the enterprise has gone forward to a place in the universe  which is uncharted and unknown  our position puts us at over a billion light years from our galaxy  data you have the helm ill be in engineering   what is it  a klingon targ  my pet  from home  but when i was a child  youre saying its a kittycat  yes i suppose you could call it that  you darling what are you doing here  now run this place isnt safe at all  tasha whats wrong   you look scared to death  i was  this is crazy i was at the colony where i grew up  being chased by a rape gang  are you alright  well youre safe now  captain we need your help   whats wrong  dont you see whats following us  ensign what are you doing  you look tense jeanluc come and have a cup of tea  maman   i make it good and strong the way you like it  well have a nice long talk   this cant be youve been  dead  but im always with you you know that  yes i felt that  but why now suddenly  you mean out here  at what you say is the end of the universe  or did you see this as the beginning of it  we believe it the outer rim  maman do you understand these things  can you tell me where my ship is what is this place  captain you were reported headed for  just a moment number one  can i help you sir  no  no lets help all of us  general quarters red alert  what is it why are we at general quarters  it was the quickest way to get everyones attention  this is the captain this is not a drill  it seems that in this place  the world of the physical universe  and the world of ideas is somehow intermixed  what we think  also becomes a reality  we must therefore i repeat must begin controlling our thoughts  we will give you more on this as our understanding increases  the enterprise will stay at full alert until the crisis is over   what did you do  it was his assistant  kosinski wasnt controlling the experiments  it was me  the equations he punched in were nonsense as we thought  i honestly thought it was me i thought somehow  somehow i was operating on his level  it was also my fault i should have realized it wasnt kosinski  how could you how could any of us  wesley did  if you knew why didnt you say  he tried twice i didnt listen   hes unconscious why  im not certain yet   he phased sir  what does that mean  parts of him disappeared then came back  nobody paid attention to him the first time  this time he was fighting it   hes dying  he mustnt  hes the only one who can get us back  realistically that doesnt seem possible  captains log supplemental our position is unknown  our only chance of returning to the known universe is a dying alien  who is generally humanoid but with a physiology  which would create medical problems in caring for him   cause  i dont know  my equipment doesnt register his life signs  i would guess exhaustion fatigue   will he be alright  why is the boy here  mom hes my friend  you may want him here sir  he seems to have developed an attachment to the boy  my name is wesley  he knows we all know   will he live  im not sure   wake him  id rather let him come round  we dont have that luxury  he could die and with him any chance we have  doctor wes we all have other friends on this ship  if we stay here we may lose the ability  to distinguish between thought and reality  regardless of the risk wake him now  recognize me im the captain and i need answers  i will do my best to provide  who are you or what  i am a traveler  traveler what is your destination   destination  yes   what place are you trying to reach  place no  theres no specific place i wish to go  what is the purpose of your journey  curiosity   thats not an answer  i have certain abilities  they give me a knowledge of propulsion  i have been trading this for passage on starfleet vessels   letting kosinski take the credit  it seemed the sensible way   until now  captain  i seek only transportation in order to see and experience your reality  i am no threat to you your ship or your crew  he isnt captain i know he isnt  our reality and in order to satisfy this curiosity  you have brought my ship and my crew into grave risk   i have made some mistakes  some mistakes  what mistakes could possibly explain these explosions of velocity  i dont know if i can put this in terms youll understand  i believe there may be a warp speed that can get us beyond galaxy m33  but there is no velocity of any magnitude  that can possibly bring us wherever this is  are our navigational sensors right  are we millions of light years from where we were   well yes  well what got us here  thought   thought  you do understand  thought is the basis of all reality  the energy of thought to put it in your terms is very powerful  thats not an explanation  i have the ability to act like a lens which focuses thought  thats just nonsense youre asking us to believe in magic  well yes this could seem like magic to you  no  no it actually makes sense to me  only the power of thought could explain what has been happening  thought is the essence of where you are now  you do understand the danger  chaos what we think is what happens  it pains me i was so careless captain  my intent was only to observe not to cause this  you should not be here until your far distant future  certainly not until youve learned control  you are from a different time  not exactly from another time i  although as you understand the concept  yes perhaps that term fits as well as any   you have this ability to travel  yes   others of your kind have it  oh yes  then why is there no record of someone like you having visited us  what wonderful arrogance  its because we have not visited you before  why not  well because up until now if youll forgive this  youve been uninteresting  its only now that your life form merits serious attention  im sorry   whats happening  hes unconscious again  revive him  whatever you need from him get it soon  sir our first leap out of our galaxy was as he said a mistake   unless he was distracted  and it weakened him  resulting in the incredible leap out here  theory  have you any facts that fit this can you get us back  captain not so fast  we have an opportunity for scientific discovery  and we report our observations how to whom  can you get us back  i will try  take him down to engineering ill be on the bridge  no   hes very weak  the captains right we must hurry  first i request a moment with the captain alone  strange how he seems to care for you  he will forget me in time which is as it should be   its wesley i want to speak about  the boy  its best you do not repeat this especially not to the mother  whatever happens it is imperative that it proceed naturally  i must get my ship back   do we have time for this  oh yes  he and a few like him are why i travel  you have it in your power to encourage him without interfering   encourage him in what  how shall i explain  are you familiar with the intricacies of what is called music  somewhat  such musical geniuses i saw in your ships libraries  one called mozart who as a small child wrote astonishing symphonies  a genius who made music not only to be heard but seen and felt  beyond the understanding the ability of others  wesley is such a person  not with music but with the equally lovely intricacies  of time energy propulsion  and the instruments of this vessel which allow all that to be played  youre right i must hurry now  but youre right he is just a boy  he should be encouraged but told none of this  were going home take him to engineering   yes sir  ill be on the bridge   put it out  how  think put the flame out in your thoughts  get to your station   concentrate on your assignment  yes sir  captains log any time entry is meaningless  we have to repeat the same warp experiment  but with one variation  a principal part of this formula  will be the thoughts of everyone on the enterprise  we have no idea how this works  we understand only that the traveler  makes use of this somehow  it is important that those aboard avoid random thoughts  that might change the reality of what were attempting to do  do you have further advice  when you begin the attempt there will be stress  its only natural the crews concentration will shift  plus some genuine fear captain  you cant notice whats happening without that  all decks all stations  this is the captain speaking i must have your full attention  in a few moments as we attempt to warp home  it is absolutely vital that you centre your thoughts  on your duty or on the welfare of the one called the traveler  think of giving him some of your strength this is an order  you must try to do this  now attempt to concentrate completely  on your duty of the moment  or on the traveler on his wellbeing  think of him as someone you care deeply for  all decks all stations battle stations  i need kosinski back on the main computer  you need me  yes  helm set in warp 15 retroactive course  warp 15 retroactive 261 mark 31 sir  bridge to engineering stand by  i feel an abundance of wellbeing on the ship  it feels like  quite wonderful  engineering to bridge were ready  on my order mr data mr la forge  engage  its not happening its not enough  warp 15 sir which is what my instruments read all along  our position is exactly what it was before this sleigh ride began sir   cease red alert  sleigh ride  whatever you want to call it i dont have a proper name for it   the travelers gone sir  gone  hes phased completely out of existence  at least out of our existence  attention all decks  with your support the traveler has returned us to our own galaxy  however he has now left us  wherever he has gone we wish him well  have the boy sent to the bridge  wesley crusher report to the bridge on the double  our next assignment is on this heading  yes sir  mr data mr la forge increase to warp five same heading   warp five sir  same heading sir  wesley come on the bridge  move  cmdr riker told me how supportive you were well done  at ease er   sit here  captain its not allowed   your orders  thats true  well i cant waive them again  only commissioned officers   its alright i understand  please dont interrupt me  im sorry sir  any commission rank even ensign  that would give him authorized access to the bridge  well then ill have to make him an acting ensign  captains log stardate 412634  for outstanding performance in the best starfleet tradition  wesley is made acting ensign  with the duties and privileges of that rank  and whether that rank becomes permanent depends on you  at the earliest opportunity  your application for starfleet academy will be tendered  until then you will learn this ship every operation and function  commander a duty schedule for mr crusher heavy on study  aye sir  meanwhile sit here and learn something   sir shall i send for dr crusher  why is someone ill  or would you rather tell her wes  sir id like to sit here for a while ill tell her later
