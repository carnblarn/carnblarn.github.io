picture  everybody larry david  hey michael york how you doing   glad to meet you  michaels here to class up our act   lou dimaggio  how are you doing  nice to meet you larry  pleasure to meet you  ill be managing the restaurant jim swenson   hi jim you were the manager of gus  yes i was   theresa nakamura  hello hi theresa  i was at gus too  lets sit lets sit  i dont know if im gonna come in on this  it sounds intriguing i have to say  we have a very exciting place here  the location is perfect and we got great ideas for a new restaurant  its going to be a hit  well i know one thing  i will not be giving you people any money if you serve kabobs   youre kidding right  no im not kidding   i dont think have kabobs  why are you a kabobaphobe   i cant stand kabobs  kabobaphobe  have you had a bad experience with kabobs what happened  just when youre putting them off the stick  im a little afraid of the stick frankly  no kabobs  how about this idea  i feel that you can never get a waiters attention  so im suggesting  that every table should have a bell on it  and so when you want the waiter you just ring a bell  what if three or four people are ringing the thing at once  how does their waiter know  every waiter could have their own tone  so you can identify when the waiter hears ding ding ding  they know its him  and if then if its ding ding ding a lower tone   a bell  they would answer to a bell  like a pavlovian dog   its like a butler bell  exactly  im surprised youre not on board with that  its english its a butler bell   michael york what do you think  im so appalled by the idea   that im struck dumb  its a good idea think about it  what else do you have  what are you doing for the waiters uniforms  we have a very tasteful white shirt dark slacks  and name tags   no good huh  i think we can do better than that   larry what do you envision  i dont know i think  ill go shopping for uniforms   youll come with me  im with you to keep an eye on things  all right so give us a choice  ill come back with something youll be very happy with  is everybody good with that im good with that  so youre in  welcome aboard  maybe  so were definitely doing this  its right on ocean its in a great location theyve got a great chef  they couldnt find somebody else to invest  there are tons of people with money  maybe they could but im lucky i was asked  we should look at it like a good thing   we can make a lot of money from this  oh i hope so   but thats not even the point  what is the point  we could hang out there  people would come in and ill walk around and go to a table   are you enjoying your meal  youre going to walk around  this is why you want to do this so you can chat with people  hows everything are you enjoying it  i thought you didnt like talking to people  i dont like talking to people i know  but strangers i have no problem with  i think itll be fun i was put in charge of uniforms  this is something that im very interested in  i always wondered how do they choose the uniforms  well im going to choose the uniforms  im going shopping with jeff to pick out uniforms for the waiters  thats why you want to do this  so you can pick out uniforms for  its not only uniforms youre making other decisions  i asked about were gonna get sweet potatoes on the menu  cause you cant get sweet potatoes anywhere have you noticed that  everybodys noticed that  i have this great idea about bells for the table  cause you can never summon waiters  they never come when you want them  did you bring this up at the meeting how did that go over   i think it went okay  they liked that idea   i think they did  people ringing bells   all over the restaurant  yeah  is that a new shirt  yeah this is the shirt   that chet was wearing in the picture  at barbaras house  i went to carusos and got it they had three left  really you went shopping  i did i love the shirt ted danson liked it too  im getting a lot of compliments on it   it looks good  feel this material this is beautiful  so barbara said shed have that frame ready next week   oh good see  see  it paid for me to open my mouth  and your dentist called and wants us over for dinner saturday   dr blore  yeah   wants to have us for dinner  yeah  i thought that youd know what that meant  hes my dentist why is he calling me for dinner  i dont know  well what are we gonna talk about my teeth  i didnt know what to say i thought you guys talked about it  ive never mentioned anything to him about getting together  i wouldnt mix social and professional thats a terrible combination  well im just gonna tell him  were going out of town or something   okay  because if we go over to his house  for dinner well have to invite him someplace  if we dont then hes gonna be offended  then the next time i go there theres gonna be tension  i invited you why didnt you invite me you know what i mean   we dont want to get into that game  ummmm  ill need a new dentist soon theres no question about it  thats the end of this dentist for all intents and purposes  im telling you its already ruined  the whole thing ah everybodys got to get together  got to get together the whole worlds got to get together  hey how about this  thats what you want the waiters to wear  yeah why not  so you want the waiters to dress like you  why is that bad  oh man youre out of control  no they should walk around looking like you   i didnt say that  well  what about this   hey what about this  come on   it looks like a tablecloth right  yeah   yeah  yeah  so the waiters shirts match the tablecloth   and  what do you mean and  thats interesting   interesting  yeah  im not finding anything  we got to get out of here theres nothing here im gonna get  remember that shirt i was wearing that ted danson liked   that cream shirt  with the black   i think ill get that for him  thats nice   i got it here  thats very nice  i might even get another one for me   why  cause i always ruin my shirts  i stain them and id like it would be good to have an extra one  is it crazy to have two of the same shirt  no its fine you get a stain on it you got another one   excuse me  yes sir  i dont know if you remember i was in a couple days ago  i bought a twotone shirt you had three in the basement  yeah the cream and black   i want to get the other two  just give me one second   check that out  man she is hot  look at

swinging baseball bats around  and even if the candy comes down  then youve got vultures coming and getting candy  stuffing it in their pocket killing each other to get to the candy  its a crazy game its dangerous i dont know how the spaniards do it  how long have they been doing this piata  not one spanish person has figured out that the piata  is a sick fucking game  i hope you know jill did not do that on purpose  really she feels terrible about it  you shouldnt have called me an asshole in front of her but   shes a pretty good speller  yeah  five years old she can spell asshole  thats pretty good  hey you know what on the way up here  i was thinking i would like that shirt  ill take it and ill exchange it it was a great gift  you cant exchange anymore theyre out   theres no more left  it doesnt matter  i can take it to a shirt guy hell fix it  this ones ruined as you can see  and i was kind of planning on keeping the other one  the one you gave me  the one you gave back to me  i only gave it back to you  because you were being rude about me having to exchange it  you still nevertheless didnt accept my gracious gift   and you gave it back to me  why are you doing this  every time we get together we push and pull like this  you should have kept the shirt in the first place  larry larry im trying to watch the wizard of oz  you just said you have two shirts upstairs
