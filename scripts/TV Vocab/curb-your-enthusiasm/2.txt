im in heaven  the parking space is heaven its all heaven  hes a very happy guy he enjoys things  you didnt hear any of this  but he asked lots of questions about my personal hygiene too  im not gonna even tell you what they were  but really personal  hes a little off i think   yeah but hes so fun  yeah hes okay  i dont really know what she sees in him but  it must be hell living with ted danson thats got to be hard   shes really terrific though  yeah she is  what a beautiful person not only on the outside  but she really has an inner beauty didnt you think  and it just kind of radiates  the shame is that i could never be friends with her you know   why couldnt you be friends with her  because shes a woman  shes married im a married man  id love to have a cup of coffee with her or something  but you can never do that because  society frowns on relationships between men and women like that  well dont let me stop you i mean  if were gonna be making friends with them  id just as soon be friends with her you can be friends with him  and you could get the personal hygiene questions okay  all right   and how about that clinton stuff  yeah  when she talked about clinton she knows

what happened was   youre still coming in to get  let me tell you what happened   somebody took my original shoes  i dont need to hear the whole story  youre coming in to purchase the shoes though right  i dont really need the shoes now  because i got them back at the bowling alley  you asked me to waive the deposit and i did that for you  you looked like an honest person and i trusted your face  he is an honest person hes very honest   this doesnt concern you  i havent done anything dishonest  i dont need the shoes anymore thats not dishonest  sir you asked a favor of me and i helped you out  but as long youre taken care of i guess thats all that really matters  no thats not whats all that really matters  i mean do you want me to buy two pairs what should i do  no i work on commission okay  so now im put in a bad situation  all right im stuck with these shoes  and so i cant even  how much is the commission ill pay it  that is so insulting how dare you  thats not a how dare you what do you mean dare im not dare   i am not a shoe whore  i didnt accuse you of being a shoe whore  im trying to rectify the situation  you cannot buy your way out of this situation   people like you are the problem  im the solution  im the solution to the problem okay  this is outrageous it really is  what kind of people invite you to go to a concert  and then they dont call you  its 430 pm maybe we should call them  do you know how awkward that is  they know they invited us to the concert theyre obviously deliberately not calling  how could i call them up and go were waiting for your call  and then theyll say well we dont want to go with you  at least lie to us   right something  call us and lie   dont let us sit here like schmucks  yeah  a lie is a gesture its a courtesy its a little respect  this is very disrespectful  why would they decide that they dont want to go with us   i dont know  didnt we all have a good time bowling   was that fun that was fun  yeah  that was a good time  did we do something to offend them  what  after barneys the other day we went out to lunch  right  and i took a sip from a glass of water  and her mother said to me thats my glass  and i went like that  i cant believe youre even acting like you dont know why were not invited   i didnt think of it  unbelievable  of course theyre not gonna call us  marys mother  whats wrong with you   i really wanted to go to that concert  so did i i like paul simon  still crazy after all these years  still crazy after all these years  socialize  familiar ways  and i aint no fool for love songs  that whisper in my ears  still crazy after all these years  hi how are you   good id like to return this please  what seems to be the problem  you know its kind of halfjacket halfshirt halfman halfbeast
