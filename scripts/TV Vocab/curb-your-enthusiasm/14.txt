first  we can stop at you know where i want to go  casa del mar the fancy restaurant by the water  we can stop and have a leisurely drink  are you kidding you can have a drink at the restaurant  no but this will be nice  itll be just a few hours of hanging out having a drink  you know first you want to just stop off  and have a drink there and then get back in the car  and then drive to the restaurant  it seems like you should just go and get the drink at the restaurant no  i would like to stop off and have a drink on the way  its the same drink whats the difference where you have it  its a different atmosphere you know what  l dont understand its a different atmosphere   what i thought  yeah  but its the drink isnt it they have it at the restaurant  whats the difference what the atmosphere is   its a big difference  but dont you want to eat  i do want to eat  but i would like to sit and have a drink and socialize  and not have food passing by us  i dont see how you could sit and have a drink  knowing that you want to leave to eat  when youre thinking about food  how can you sit and relax and have a drink it doesnt  youre missing the whole point of the drink  thats it what is the point of the drink i am missing the point  youre at a place where everyones sitting having cocktails and socializing  then why even go to the restaurant if it isnt socializing then why go there

hbo  yeah remember two years ago l got out of that special  i told him my stepfather got in an accident  yeah why did you make up a lie about a stepfather   you dont even have a stepfather  i just thought it was a better lie  cause if you make up a lie about a stepfather  youll be believed dont you think   that mustve been awkward  yeah it was pretty awkward  but he didnt mention anything and neither did l  so i dont know   want some noodles  get some of this kung pao shrimp  wheres all the shrimp here  wheres all the shrimp theres only three shrimp   in that giant container theres  yeah three shrimp   theres usually more than that  theres usually like 10  you can have them  did he take the shrimp  ill bet he took the shrimp   wasserman  yeah  he was probably hungry he got the container  he knew he saw it wasnt his food  and he ate shrimp and then brought it back  would he really do something like that though  what do you mean would he really theres three shrimp in there  i really dont want to be eating after somebody else  i mean its just the whole notion of the guy gets the wrong order of food  and takes food that doesnt belong to him  and then returns it what thinking were not gonna notice this  the guy took our shrimp  good nice move  hi lar its good to see you   yeah good to see you  did it take you a long time to get here  maybe about 25 minutes half hour   my

here  no we can go back and forth  we dont need back and forth well just do forth dont need back  youve turned into a very nice man  im a lovely gentleman   so whats this idea im dying to hear it  all right heres the idea   yeah  you play an actress  who was on a big tv show a big hit show like a seinfeld  and when the show ends  the actress has trouble getting work  because everybody identifies her with this character  who she played on the show   right  lets say she played evelyn okay  okay  and she grows to hate the character and she becomes embittered and hostile  all these people who are yelling out evelyn all the time  and everybody wants her to do evelyn  and she cant get work because of evelyn   and thats the show  thats the show   thats a pretty interesting idea  you think so  the thing that i love about it is that you know this does happen to me  and it happens to you youre able to deal with this  elaine elaine are you elaine  that happened to me last week l was skiing  evelyn evelyn ltll be on the series  hey evelyn  thats a good name for the series  how about this arent you evelyn  arent you evelyn  thats pretty good  i mean i think its a really funny idea  but i wonder if its better suited for somebody  you know like jason  jason i dont   let me tell you why  this isnt jason at all   because  i think hes completely wrong for it  i mean but he played such a  l dont know an idiot on the show  maybe it would be better suited for somebody like jason  i could see you being more frustrated than jason  cause you know how many different things you can do  yeah thats true  really this is all he can do between you and me  yeah you know lm more   yeah youre more versatile  versatile   thats why i see it for you  yeah all right i like this idea a lot   you do  yeah i like it   good lm so relieved  so lets pitch it to hbo  at hbo  i want to be able to say fuck you know and i wanna say  whats the big deal about saying fuck  cocksucker  you dont need to say that

president  yeah  what problem  i think hes bad lm not gonna go into why   i just dont think hes a good guy  what if we didnt deal with him  let me tell you why lm bringing this up  ive got a friend a pretty good friend michael halbreich who works there   i dont know if you know him  gay guy  gay no hes not gay hes married   michael halbreich  yeah   really  yeah hes married   i could have sworn he

this  why park the car go into this hotel  have the drink then come back out  get in the car again drive to the restaurant  it seems like a huge waste of time  you can get a drink at the restaurant   its sort of an oldfashioned  yeah it is  romantic idea dont you think  yeah its lovely  were just going out to eat   did you go out for the drink  no  was she mad  very annoyed were not on good terms because of it  i think you were totally right  yeah see  it makes no sense unless youre trying to get laid  and maybe thats what she was trying to do  maybe cheryl wanted to get laid  okay i got your

shit  im really sorry im so sorry  what where you doing what was that   he insulted me  how  he implied that i was lying about my stepfather   you dont have a stepfather  but i didnt like the implication  the implication for your imaginary stepfather  how can he insult you about somebody whos imaginary   for goodness sake  because it was  let me just ask you something what is the shrimp business  you know he got my container by mistake from the chinese restaurant  and he took out eight shrimp from it  that didnt belong to him and gave it back to me  as if i wasnt gonna know that he took the shrimp  what does he think lm a moron  larry everybody steals shrimp and everybody lies about it  this is hollywood you got to apologize to this guy   please  you have to apologize  we want to make this here i want to make this here   go apologize  ill tell you something else too  you have to get yourself into major psychoanalysis  im in analysis it doesnt do anything   what kind of analysis  does nothing  apparently not  have you talked to him about your imaginary stepfather  ill tell you this right now  im going back to that restaurant and lll go count the shrimp  and ask them how many they put in the container   ill bet you theres eight missing at least  you do that  everyone the game is fivecard stud everyone ante up there   so mickey what do you do  im a dentist   ive been brad and julias dentist for years  really mickey that is good to know  because i actually need a dentist mine just moved   give candy a call on monday  i will  you know my dentist told me l have the gums of a 25yearold man  i think it was about the nicest thing anyones ever said to me  everythings okay with you and allan right  larry you guys are all made up and everything   yes we kissed and made up  this is the unfortunate shrimp incident   thats the one  ive been dying to hear this  there was a mix up at a chinese takeout restaurant  larry got allans order and allan larrys  i guess when they switched them back allan had taken seven of your shrimp   thats my claim yeah  allegedly  right and it turned into a big thing and he stomped out of the meeting  which i had never seen before i almost thought it was not real but it was  i saw the jackson pollock movie the night before  and i got very influenced by the artist you know  it was very impressive  but everythings fine now and were very delighted  you guys are with hbo very happy to have you   where are we ive lost  lm out shes out  im in  no youre not out sweetie its only two   god okay  okay youre good  all right lm such a ditz okay  so larry how come you guys didnt take the show to nbc  with the history you guys have there   you want to answer that question  because i wouldnt let him  you wouldnt let him  no because ge will not take responsibility for dumping the pcbs in the hudson river  and i say why keep supporting them its ridiculous  but the main thing l would like to add is that on hbo  you can say fuck  and that is you know very tempting  so you throw in a fuck you double your laughs  its a crowdpleaser fuck is a crowdpleaser   you write it and lll say it  the game is  the game is guts  card skill game brad  no one appreciates guts whats the matter  lets play it twocard guts or threecard guts  twocard guts two cards down   whoever loses has to match the pot  we keep betting until people drop out  this is stiff this could be recordbreaking  you showbiz types get a little richer than the dental profession  ill bet you theres about 800 in there you know that   i would say at least  its all right  lets try   im in  yes   im out  i cant do it either  i dont even have enough to cover that   not a chance  no lm out   go in somebody  yeah  melissa come on   no out  michael   im here  in  no lm out  hall you must go in shes gonna steal the whole thing   dont let your wife steal this thing  how much is that   a lot  its about 700 800 in there come on   700 800  are you serious  i really cant do it lve got nothing  my god look at that holy cow  youve got to tell us how much that is   what did you have  i had a 6 and a 10  i cant believe you stole this pot  im sorry  what a bluff l cant believe it what did you have   i had nothing 2 and a 4  thats what i had nothing   what did you have  i am afraid to say i had an ace high   ace high  sweetie  i know but  how could you not go in with an ace high  you cunt what a cunt  i cant believe that you didnt go in with that  i just thought she  what a hand thats a great hand for this game  how could you not go in with an ace high  i think thats kind of a misogynist thing to say  come on lm kidding around  on behalf of the women at this table and myself i am offended by that  please were playing poker here  that kind of language is not allowed in a game  in a decent game  thats so unacceptable thats not okay  its okay lm fine its fine  its not fine you know what time to go how about that  yeah i think lm gonna call it a night  and the parishes are back next week right   yeah theyre back from the galapagos  it was nice meeting you guys thank you  thank you so much   im gonna call you about my  you do that call candy   bye thanks for coming  it was nice meeting you  im sorry if i offended anyone  thanks for coming you guys it was great to see you  yeah well see you next week  so i guess we probably wont be invited back  to their poker night   yeah i dont think so  you think   i cant believe you did that  come on  you just shouted out the cword in front of women  in front of other people  lts a word you use when somebody doesnt act manly  and he didnt act manly he shouldve gone in  he shouldve gone in with that ace  i think there are other words that you could use  besides that one  maybe in retrospect l shouldve said pussy   jeez i cant be  lm really shocked  i cant believe that guy called me a misogynist   i know  nobody ever called me that before  maybe you are maybe lm learning things about you  maybe i am a misogynist maybe i like to beat my wife a little bit   wait no larry  you little bitch  okay lll be good i promise   buckle up  im buckling  and wasserman says this is our last chance this is it  cause of what you said to halbreich  all of the women at hbo they dont want to work with you   thats ridiculous  they think youre a misogynist   cause i called the guy a cunt so what  cause you called the guy a cunt  big deal i call men pricks all the time men want to work with me  cunts worse  its not worse pricks and cunts theyre equal   pricks cunts come on they balance out  no cunts much heavier   why is cunt heavier  i never questioned it just is   thats sexist to me come on  michael halbreich took a leave of absence  what do you mean  from you calling him a cunt hes shellshocked  and hes examining everything in his life  taking a leave of absence   man is that so  yeah  shit you know  l thought he was one of those effeminate heterosexuals  theres no such thing as an effeminate heterosexual  youre either gay or youre not gay he was gay hes gay  hi would you like to be seated  no actually lm a little curious about something  were having a little dispute  how many shrimp do you generally put in the kung pao shrimp  eleven   you always put in 11  we have a very strict policy about that  thank you very much   hi mickey  so its this cheryl   yes good to see you again  good to see you again   that was quite a poker game  yes  i dont think we ever had one like that  yeah larry can get a little carried away sometimes i guess  he takes his poker very  this bruise theres a funny story here  cheryl you know i barely know you  but when we were coming out of the poker game the other night  we saw into your car  and we saw larry hitting you  larry and i do a little bit sometimes where he acts like hes punching me  and i act like lm getting hurt   we just kind of  youll have to excuse me  l dont deal with this kind of thing often  but if you would like to talk with me about this  in this cubicle  we have patientdoctor confidentiality  and that applies to dentists too  i think so  i think were on the wrong page here  yeah i have a very good socialworker friend  mickey listen this is a complete misunderstanding  theres no misunderstanding  what we saw larry do to michael at that card game  theres no misunderstanding that i saw him beating you in your car  i have seen larry david in action and that man is an animal  and he has to be stopped  larry  so thats it its all over at hbo  dentist got in touch with wasserman thinks lm a wifebeater  he thinks lm a wifebeater   i mean its so crazy  i know   theres other networks right  this is not the end of the world hbo  well go to abc i dont have to be at hbo   no  its not tv its tv  what do they think people are watching   yeah  watch it on tv  dont you you dont go to the movies to see it   how are we doing over here folks  i think lm done  can i get this out of the way for you great   delicious  you like it   yeah  great  how about dessert menu we got a lot of good stuff   yeah excellent  you know what i think well take the bill   you sure okay lll be right back  lets go to shutters and get dessert there   just get a change of scenery  you dont want dessert here  it would just be more fun to go someplace else  relax by the beach  but were already here we could have dessert in two minutes   then we could  but its not all about just the dessert   whats it about  its a little bit of an adventure  to go some place else and see something new  i dont know if thats any adventure really   thats an adventure  thats an adventure  you know what fine   no wait i just dont get it  i mean because its ridiculous   were having a meal  were having a good time   and i suggest to go to some  youre breaking up the good time  youre breaking up the good time  cause i feel like l want a cup of coffee after i eat dinner  i dont feel like getting up and driving some place  you know larry l would just like to go home  quick cup of decaf  can i get it to go  thats different though   are you mrs david  yes i am  hi lm linda johnson from social services  we received a phone call that there was some domestic violence  going on in this household  actually this is all a big misunderstanding  yeah this  would you care to press charges
