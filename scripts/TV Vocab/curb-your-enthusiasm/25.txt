undertaking  it is a big undertaking but you know what  i get to have alanis morissette singing in my living room   i cannot wait  shes fantastic  that first album the song you oughta know  and shes referring to this mr duplicity  larry has no idea what were talking about  when you said mr duplicity i thought you were referring to me  you know who its about her guitar player  no its a big secret

the check  well last night was it believe me  all right im going out  all right  what will i do about mindy reiser  i wish i could make it up to her  i couldve at least asked about the perfume store  people love when you ask them about what theyre doing  next time you see her just be nice to her  she thinks im the worlds biggest schmuck  hey larry i got to talk to cheryl  hey wanda whats going on  i have some news  are you okay  yeah and no  but i got to tell you something  you might as well get over here too  oh my god youre so serious   its big  whats going on  okay my brother  his best friend works for the cia  he got this information from the highest source possible  there is going to be a terrorist attack  this weekend in la  yeah and you cannot tell a soul  my brother told me but im not supposed to tell anybody  but you know you my girl i had to tell you   thank you  im getting out of town  im going to vegas with my boyfriend   i advise yall to do the same  what kind of attack  attack larry anthrax a bomb i dont know  it could be something crazy  and this is  they said its 90 sure that somethings gonna go down   why cant we tell anybody  they dont want panic cheryl  thats why theyre not telling anybody  we got to get out of here   yeah get out of here  this weekend theres a big  nrdc benefit that weve been working on for months  alanis morissette is gonna be there  im just im thinking out loud  why dont we call the terrorists and ask them  could they pick another weekend more suited for you  postpone the benefit lets get out of here  i thought id never say this but larrys right  if we dont show up at the benefit   what will people  lf what  look okay i did my part  youre my friend i had to tell you   thank you  im going to vegas   okay okay  yall out your mind  im trying to help people theyre talking about a benefit  call me when you get back into town  hopefully youll be here  wow  yeah larry  i just dont see how we can leave this weekend  this whole nrdc benefit was my idea  i talked the braudys into having it at their house  alanis morissette is coming to sing  i mean i just  i just know i cant leave town  well maybe  you know maybe i can  i can go  and where are you gonna go  i could go golfing at pebble beach maybe  mmhmm do you think thats a good idea  for us to be apart if something did happen  then at least you know one of us would  survive  it just seems like if were gonna go   we should go together  not necessarily  almost seems a little selfish  that you would want both of us to  perish  so youd be fine going on without me  well it would be  very difficult at first im sure  but hopefully i could at some point  get back some semblance of a life  okay  if you feel good about  one of us dying  and the other one surviving  and you can live with that for the rest of your life  then you should go golf this weekend   ill think about it  think about it  hey mindy  oh larry pauls not here  i came actually to see you do you have a few minutes  i need to talk to you its pretty important   you came to see me  yeah  what for  okay this is going to sound a little crazy  but believe me its all true  i have a friend who has a friend  whose brother works in the cia  and he has it from the highest possible source  that theres going to be a terrorist attack  on los angeles this weekend   it sounds crazy  youre putting me on   im not putting you on  this is a joke   larry come on  this is not a joke this is the truth   paul put you up to this  no he didnt  i havent even spoken to him  you have a contact in the government   totally reliable  are you serious  mindy your life is in danger get out of here  what kind of attack is it gonna be   it wasnt very specific  where  it could be anywhere its in la  oh my god i cant believe it

she lives in orange county shes kind of far away  theyre not going to orange county the terrorists  they have nothing in orange county  so weve got to get out of town huh   absolutely  maybe well go to the desert  maybe that will be good palm springs  palm springs why not its 90 minutes very nice  where do you stay when youre there   four seasons  four seasons  yeah  maybe well go there or up north  santa barbara is lovely this time of year  where are you and cheryl going  unfortunately we cant go  you cant  oh the braudys nrdc event   you know about that thing huh  of course i know about it  our invitation got lost in the mail or something   i dont want to get in the middle  no listen  i know you and cheryl dont have anything to do with it  its between us and the braudys  but its amazing you are staying in town  risking your lives for something like this  its unbelievable  cheryl wanted to leave  i thought its best that we go to the benefit  its amazing i have a million things to do  but im curious about something   why did you tell me  what are you talking about  youre friends we like you so much  you and paul you know i was driving around  i saw your shop i thought ive got to tell mindy  i have really misjudged you  i cant thank you enough you are an amazing person  you are a wonderful human being   i cant thank you enough  im trying to be a good friend  i

apologize to his wife  oh and what was 90  he asked me what the chances were  that this could happen again   that id ignore her  right  listen ive been doing a lot of thinking  i really think we should reconsider going  we should get out of here dont you think  no  this is crazy to hang around here what for  we are gonna stay right here   where are all the cars  i dont know  is there a valet we missed or something   hi  hey stu  hi larry and cheryl   come on in  thank you   wheres all the cars  please come in  the partys in full swing come on  are we the first ones here  where is everybody  im actually surprised youre here  cause you know theres a terrorist attack  that is going to take out the entire city of los angeles  some time this weekend  youll notice alanis morissette is not here   obviously  she got very nervous   she said she wouldnt sing  she left town   really  gone yeah   cause she heard  apparently the word kind of spread  it sounds like it mightve started  with mindy reiser  and guess who told mindy  who   me  what   no  you told mindy reiser about this  okay so you knew  this is exactly what wanda said  she said dont cause a panic dont tell people  did we not have this discussion   its a little embarrassing  this is a little embarrassing  this is humiliating beyond belief is what this is  i felt bad because i snubbed mindy at dinner the other night  i didnt talk to her and l  told her thered be a terrorist attack in los angeles this weekend  there was supposed to be one   you tell mindy reiser  she has betrayed us  time after time she opens her mouth you cant tell that woman anything  why do you think we dont talk to her   i dont know  she has a big mouth  and by the way larry  thank you for telling us about this terrorist attack   i didnt tell anybody else  you told mindy  thats really nice of you  why dont you call your friends the reisers  why dont you have a little bite with them  since you snubbed them and all go ahead all right  i am going to bed  have a little bite with the reisers  at least they pick up a check every now and then   what the hell does that mean  what  i know what you do every time the check comes  you run to the bathroom   oh fuck you  honey dont  you dont think i know about that bathroom trick   i invented that trick  go to hell  the bathroom trick i got a problem a medical problem  yeah you got a problem paying money   no thank you  ill take one thanks  mmm very good   whos the chef  i dont know   i shouldnt ask  i dont think you should  thank you okay thats enough come on  i just want to know for the restaurant  were you not listening when wanda told you not to tell anybody  she trusted you not to say anything to anyone  why in the world would you tell mindy reiser  i was trying to get on her good side  i guess what we should do is have it here  what  reschedule the benefit and have it here  okay  and ill have to ask the braudys to come over  the braudys no no no theyre not coming forget it  they went way over the line tonight  invite the reisers not the braudys  invite the reisers for spite  this isnt a game larry  braudys freaking  everythings freaking with this guy he cant
