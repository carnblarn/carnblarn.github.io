do you think were men right and men need it more  no its not about that i got it   no why  i got it its fine  its because they are so offended  by our genitalia  that they have to be in love with us to have it  thats why we can have sex with anyone and they cant  because penises dont look as attractive and thats why  yes they cant just have sex with any man  they have to really love the man to get involved with their penis  with their grotesque penis  im missing something  no i think its a good theory  its a disgusting theory at lunch ill tell you that  were already finished so it doesnt matter   thanks for lunch by the way  youre welcome what is this  what  theres a space here to tip a captain  a captain instead of a waiter  no both  look at this  theres a space for a captain and a space for a waiter  so you give both  what do you mean i give both what am i supposed to give  you give the waiter what you want and the captain half  half of the waiters half of my   allotment  i have 20 percent allotted to the waiter  sound like youre in the schmata business  the captains gonna be horning in now on my allotment   on what the waiters getting  no the waiter was good  so its 30 percent is that what youre saying    20 and 10  yeah  what does a captain do  i think i saw the guy at the podium he pointed  the captains horning in on the waiter cause most people are probably  reducing the tip to the waiter   you think hes horning  i do  thats hilarious  who is this captain out of the clear blue sky   youre not leaving anything  im giving the waiter 30 percent  let the waiter give the captain 10 percent if he wants ill give the waiter the money  lets go thanks for lunch by the way and thanks for the penis talk  next time therell be a space for a lieutenant  then
