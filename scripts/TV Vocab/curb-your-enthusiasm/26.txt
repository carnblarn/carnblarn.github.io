fucking unbelievable  maybe i should hang out by his house and scream and yell  no thats great speaking of screaming and yelling  im trying to calm down a little bit  so i decided dont mock  im gonna start ive never done it before to meditate  you know i used to do it did you know that   i vaguely remember  yeah i used to do it  what do you do actually  i had a mantra you know  and you repeat this mantra in your head   you repeat it  yeah say it over and over again   where do you get mantras  from a yoga instructor  im not gonna i have to sign up  for a yoga class or a mantra class  you could say anything you want give yourself your own mantra  you want a mantra ill give you a mantra  lonely lonely   lonely  lonely   just keep repeating it  that would work  you want mine ill give you mine   is that allowed  whos gonna stop us   nobody  its totally applicable  what is your mantra  okay actually   are you taking it back  no im telling you   oh  ji   thats it  ji ya  ji ya what does it mean  i have no idea but keep repeating it over and over again  ji ya ji ya ji ya you know half an hour  half an hour   ji oh shit  what  this guy ed swindell hes spotted me  hes gonna want to do a stopandchat  dont dont dont go dont go   oh my god i got to  oh what a fuck  i got a lot of shopping to do have a blast   hey larry  hey ed  good to see you what a surprise  good place isnt it  yeah were clothes shopping and i had to get out of there  you know little deslys the princess  shes holding up these two things  which makes me look more growedup daddy  you know  my mother just died  oh larry im so sorry  i kind of need to be alone with my own thoughts  oh absolutely jeez bless your heart  our thoughts are with you   thank you  yeah yeah  excuse me  yep  im looking for my mothers grave adele david  she was just buried  yeah yeah  i think its supposed to be right over there  she got moved special section  what special section  youd better talk to the general manager  take a right here and its the first building on the right  my mother was moved to a special section  yes evidently you were out of town  well i wouldve been here but i wasnt informed about it  well obviously we have a section reserved for people  who well who just dont qualify  for the interment in consecrated ground  its a place where we put the villains the suicides  the gentiles who are from mixed marriages  okay okay this is a horrendous mistake okay  let me explain please when the shammas examined her  he found that she had a tattoo  on the  tattoo my mother had a tattoo  yes sir its on the right cheek  of her right buttock if you will  my mother had a tattoo on her ass  on her right buttock yes sir now  so what if she did have a tattoo so what  according to leviticus you shall not make any gashes  in your flesh for the dead nor incise yourself  in other words to adorn oneself in such a manner  was found by maimonides many many years ago of course  to be an offense  which would disqualify such a person  from burial in consecrated ground  okay  look i wasnt here i shouldve been here  i wasnt called my father for some reason didnt call me   your dad was here  if i was here  this never wouldve happened sir im here now  and id like to rectify this id like to get her  where shes supposed to be where we paid for her plot  now if there was some youthful indiscretion  and she got this tattoo which i still cant even  hardly believe my ears when you even tell me this  but okay say she does have this tattoo over there  you know so come on  so what  theres nothing i can do sir  the law is the law  thats two things you didnt tell me  all right im sorry im sorry what can i do  what are we gonna do about this special section thing   we cant keep her there  this is ridiculous  well thats true i dont understand this  but they have this special section  its the stupidest stupidest thing i ever heard of   i agree with you totally  never heard of anything so insane  i have heard of it  she would be sick to her stomach if she knew  yes she would be upset  bottom line is shed be sick to her stomach  when did she get this tattoo  the tattoo we were just married  we walked down the boardwalk over there  she saw a tattoo parlor she said hey lets do it  your parents had tattoos  with our names  that was an epic words of love  a real show of love  i cant imagine my parents making love  i cant imagine you making love  wow well that looks good   well thank you  thank you very much   thank you honey  so whats for dinner  turkey  no i had turkey for lunch  oh well  its all right its okay  im gonna go check on that turkey   ill take whatever you have  thank you ned  bad call huh having turkey for lunch  well who knew i didnt know  you doubled up  what am i gonna do order chinese food in la  you cant order chinese food in la  theres no good chinese food in la  right cause all the good chinese cooks went to new york  a country of one billion people  couldnt send one good chef to los angeles  how can you possibly be arguing  the quality of good chinese food in la versus new york  all right fine  you know what come here come here  all right heres my idea okay  i want to get i want to move her body  i want to move the body to where its supposed to be  because mom would not want to be there  its not right i feel terrible about it  and  how do you move how do we move her  im gonna try and pay off the gravedigger is what im gonna do  wow  that does not sound like a good idea  i think it sounds fantastic  its not dangerous because i dont have to do anything  but pay off the gravedigger thats all i have to do  i think i can do it if he takes the money fine  if not well at least i tried  you think you can get this man to dig it up  if you offer somebody enough money theyll do it  i got to tell you we tried everything we could  we talked to these people they would have none of it  if you can pay this guy off i say go do it  id like to contribute id like to contribute a few dollars  youre not contributing this whole tattoo thing is just  i agree with you completely   honest to god i think its a great  i think its terrible   shh quiet quiet  all right   well do it  i think its a great idea   its a great idea  its a scary idea  ji ya ji ya ji ya  yeah who is it   its me  ld   yeah  i cant er  whats the matter huh  im meditating  oh my god youre kidding  no im getting into this and its starting to work  i just forgot to turn the phone off im just pissed off  oh im sorry actually thats kind of what im calling about   about what  i was
