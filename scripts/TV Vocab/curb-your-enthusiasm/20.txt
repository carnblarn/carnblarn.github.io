traumatic events from our childhood  and do you think this might relate to anything that may have happened to you  my mother did throw me against a brick wall  when i was an infant maybe that had

mouth all right lm sorry hows the show going  you dont watch it why do you care lm just making conversation  thats why lm not throwing it back your way  did you enjoy it l stopped it  what do you mean who stops a whackoff  l stopped it after 1 2 pumps no wonder youre still uptight  you either do zero pumps or a thousand pumps  l dont know how i did it  how did you do that what did you summon  l dont know how i did it  lf i stopped at 1 2 pumps l would tell my wife  ld go home and say honey i was getting a massage  and i took 1 2 pumps and i stopped cause i love you  l will never ever tell her l would  and if your wife ever finds out youre a noble man you made it stop  shes not gonna find out dont worry about it  all right  oh my god  shes got an appointment with  that psychic today  the holeinone psychic l told you about that  yeah  the psychic told his wife he would hit a hole in one and he did  could a psychic know something like that she knew hole in one  you better stop her

here  hi hi  how was your massage good  good guess what l have made plans for us tonight  were gonna celebrate your cbs deal lts not even  listen i have a limo thats gonna pick us up  lts gonna take us to moho for dinner at the w hotel  and then if were feeling frisky  then we can stay all night do whatever we want  l saw that guy who manages the place rick crane  l ran into him on the street the other day and i didnt do a stopandchat  he wanted to stop and talk and i just kept walking  but i said hello but it could be a little touchy  why didnt you stop  lts too awkward and horrible to do those stopandchats  dont worry about it l wouldnt worry about it  we probably wont even run into him we have the meeting with cbs today  lts not a done deal or anything l dont even know  come on its as good as done right  have you seen my keys l have an appointment with the psychic  lm actually running late i got them  all right i will see you later honey i got a better idea  what lets fool around  right now listen i have an appointment  forget the psychic lets fool around  lt took me a long time to get this no not right now  no means no  god no save it for tonight  larry no listen i have got to get going  youre gonna make me late lve got a lump  lm afraid shes gonna tell you about it  do you hear what lm saying lm dying  and thats the name of the show arent you evelyn  l like the edge of it because its funny but its a little quirky too  this is all larrys idea he came to my office and pitched it  and i immediately just thought it was superb  and lar hello  hello were pitching  did she offer you coffee or water or something  she did i dont want any but perhaps youd like an espresso  we can make you a latte here lm okay thank you  all right you know the thing thats hard  about having been on a successful show  is that its great  but everybody identifies me with elaine  okay so for instance  recently i was skiing with my family in jackson hole  and i was wearing the helmet the goggles  the big baggy clothes covered in snow blah blah blah  l see your husband larry  yeah he getting a massage right  he getting more than just a massage  hes very happy  yeah he having sex with her hand  she pump 32 times then  so that is an example dont you think  larry isnt that a good example  of trying to like the skiing thing  like when she was skiing no thats just what i said  l know she was skiing and then she had the problem  no i said that so  situations like that are gonna come up on the show  just like that so lm thrilled that youre here  lm a huge fan of both of you obviously thank you  and i love your idea  and we would love to be in business with you  great terrific fantastic  talk further about casting and further you know  lve kind of gotta take off lll see you soon  thank you nice to see you  well be in touch  how did it go  lt went well i think  l think they really liked the show i think  l think they want to do it  arent you gonna ask me how my appointment went  right the psychic how did it go  l know everything larry  l know what happened  what happened what do you mean what happened  what happened what happened  what are you talking about did something happen  yeah what happened  that youre having an affair  lm not having an affair  l know about it she told me about it  she told you what what did she tell you thats insane  she said that youre having an affair with a woman with long red hair  and a tattoo of a star  l have not touched another woman thats ridiculous  lm not having any affair youre not having an affair  no why would she make up a story like that  l dont know why she would maybe shes an antisemite  l dont think so  you dont think so no  lm sure theres some korean antisemites  shes not korean  shes american  shes american l thought you said her name was kim  her name is kim  this is not the point  the point is that she told me this whole thing about you having an affair  shes wrong she seemed very sure of it  no its not true lm not having an affair l have never touched another woman  never ever  ever ever  lf you were having an affair youd probably lie about it wouldnt you  l would imagine i would  then how do i know that this just isnt a lie  because if i just told you the truth about that  it means that lm just a truthful person who would tell you the truth about anything  no affair sorry  promise whos gonna have an affair with me  lm not a cool guy you gotta be cool to do that  thats true l couldnt do that  l wont know how what would i do l dont know you wont be good at it  lt took me six months to even put a move on you  l know  she didnt say anything about my health right  no come on  seriously  l know because i had this whole night planned for us  well still have a great night

appetizer or are you going straight to the main dish  l dont know  whatll we do about that driver let him sit in the car for the next couple of hours  thats his night  thats why he gets paid he sits

out with our silverware  l am in a way but lm not stealing it  lm just borrowing it for a minute and letting him eat his meal then lll get it back  were having dessert lll give him two minutes and get back the fork  l call that stealing  okay i know what this is about  youre upset the other day when i saw you on the street  and i didnt do a little stopandchat  you know what lm not good at artificial small talk  hello how are you kind of thing l dont know what youre talking about  could you wait right there what what are you doing  lm gonna call the police  youll be appearing at the west los angeles municipal court  judge katz thats a lovely building  yeah youre gonna like that lf you could sign right here please  all right i guess in hindsight  l probably shouldve let the guy eat with his hands  that wouldve been the better thing to do right  just have him get it all over his face  and have dogs come up maybe and lick it off him  thats really what i shouldve done  sir youll have every opportunity to present your case to judge katz  the court date is on the back okay  and you have a good evening yes you too thank you very much  oh god the driver shit i completely forgot  l am so sorry  l had the fork and the guy caught me taking the fork out of the restaurant  and he called the police  l have to go before a judge dont worry about it lm okay thanks  did you eat the food no lll get something on the way home  dont worry about it lm good lm sorry  so lll maybe call you next week  that was great thank you youre welcome  excuse me  lm sorry i know this sounds strange i just  do you have a tattoo of a star  how did you know that  can i just yeah on my arm thats wild  cheryl what are you doing  larry  ln the matter of larry david the record reflect the presence of mr david  this case is here for sentencing  mr david you wish to be heard before i impose sentence on you  yes judge katz and may i say shabbat shalom   what happened is simply that i was trying to  bring a fork to a working man  who was a driver a limousine driver  and he had dinner but he did not have a fork to eat it  all i was did was attempted to bring him a fork and a napkin  so he wouldnt have to eat with his hands and get it all over his face and his clothing  and it was only out of some personal animus  that the restaurateur had toward me because i ran into him on the street  and i didnt stop and have a little chat with him  you know i dont like to make little chitchat on the street  l like to have a real conversation with people  lts touching what you tell me lt seems to me there was an indication  that you were gonna do what you wanted when you wanted  because you feel because of your celebrity  somehow you can do things without consequences  mr david i need your help in this  obviously a fine isnt going to do anything  lt just wont mean anything to you you have too much money  so what do you expect this court to do for the public to understand  lm not according you any special treatment  l could work at the temple on saturday mornings  hand out tallises and yarmulkes  and you think this is a fitting punishment lsnt it a joy  temple can be quite grueling as you well know  you know mr david lve been thinking about this  and you know what lm gonna do  lm gonna give you a sentence that will guarantee  that you will never ever do this again  l swear to god lm not lying  hi larry  l didnt beat my wife  hows the shrimp al  are you enjoying the shrimp from the chinese restaurant  evening  that was a water bottle in my pants  a water bottle  heres a good question for who wants to be a millionaire  what idiot runs abc  but lm not gonna  lts a long story  l was trying to help a driver a working man  so he wouldnt have to eat with his hands
