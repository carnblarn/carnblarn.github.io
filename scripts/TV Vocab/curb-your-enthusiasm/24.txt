saucy   we have no chef  no chef   how long  we open in two weeks  we basically stopped looking after we got randy  so were back to square one  you got arms on your chair  youve got arms on your chair look at that   what  one second   i got no arms what is that  what are you doing  im just getting a chair with arms  larry what are you doing you want to focus  were in this mess cause you took our chef  for your own little personal party  at least i was at the pool party yesterday  im trying to be part of this thing   the what  i had a pool party yesterday  jeff and i were the only ones who showed up  it was a little embarrassing yeah  i think you all owe him an apology  i told you i couldnt make it im glad you had a good time  hugh im sorry i wrote the wrong date in my book  i was tied up at the last minute  we have no chef  it was a good party we had a great time  thank you for coming  enough about parties what about chefs  we need to take responsibility for getting a chef  absolutely make a concerted effort together please  when i need a new editor i get him beg borrow or steal  i go out raid get we need to do that with a chef  i was in this restaurant the other day it was a coffee shop  and for some reason i had a side dish of applesauce  i have to tell you it was really fantastic  it was so tasty and im thinking  they never serve applesauce in restaurants  and it could really be  if and when the time comes for us  to be thinking about stuff like this as a side dish  were gonna write that down very helpful  when you look for your chef  make sure they know a little about applesauce  you buy it at a supermarket it comes in a jar  we should consider it for the menu encourage people even  i think were good i got to go to a meeting  everybodys gonna look right  if anyone finds anything out call  its a very underrated side dish thats my point  its an underrated side dish  did you really just sign sarah jessica parker  to a recording contract  yeah why not  i want to show solidarity but otherwise  its gonna work out dont worry about it  its only money big deal  yeah my money larry see you later   excellent  love to meet with you hugh   bye bye  all right  thank you so much for coming  oh please we had a wonderful time  its too bad these other schlubs couldnt   they missed a good party  yeah they sure did  the weather worked out it was great  it was a little rude on their part i thought  i dont care  so at the pool yesterday i saw your son  the kids got some penis on him hes pretty good  what are you saying  your son his penis  what are you saying that to me for  hey its a compliment whats the big deal  whats the compliment  how is it bad hes got a nice big penis so what  im not talking about your wifes tits this is rude  you could say my wife has nice tits as long as its complimentary  come on hugh  hugh not you hugh okay  hyoo  hugh  im sorry youre having such a hard time   hi  hi  hi  hi  you remember martine the mellons nanny  from the pool party  yeah shes having a bit of a problem  a problem ill say mr mellon fired me  its my suitcase it doesnt have wheels  oh  so she came over here  it seems that one of the guests  felt the cabana bathroom was beneath him  and made his way into the main house  how did he find out  margarita the cook  shes got a problem with me  she told that i was the person that let the guest in   she squealed on you  she ratted   and he fired you  and he fired me  of course i remember what you said about you know  you would be responsible if anything happened  did you tell him that it was me  no i dont dime i didnt dime  so i remember when i let you in  you said if theres any problem i think  ill take care of it so here i am  im gonna have to hold you to that  cause i dont have another job  so i am homeless   except i dont stink  okay  your home is big  you know what martine i bet  mr david can do something about this situation   i hope so  yeah  is there any way that you could maybe talk to mr mellon  and straighten things out because i think  if you spoke with him i dont know  he would take me back im a pretty good nanny   all right  i brought my suitcase  so if theres any problem i can just stay here  there wont be a problem   larry will take care of it  oh i hope so  ahem well  thats a really good idea and ordinarily i would  but hugh and i have had kind of a fallingout  what happened  well i was in the restaurant earlier and  we got to talking about the party  i happened to mention that i caught a glimpse of his sons penis and  how about that thing  its huge   it was the wrong thing to do  it probably was  anyway like i was saying its gonna be difficult  to talk to him  why would you do that larry  i took a risk  you know what i think you wont have a problem  finding another job  people in this town love nannies   they need them  yeah  ill need mr mellon as a reference if i get another nanny job  he was my only reference that was my first nanny job   oh  what did you do before that  before that i worked at magic mountain  in the looney tunes lodge for 15 years  its where the looney tunes characters would come out  and sign autographs for kids  you know jeff and i  went there once with his daughter   you did  i went in there  and that song that theme is played   they play it all the time  it was fun  can i talk to you in the kitchen for just a second  sure  i told you not to use that bathroom  why did she come over here  obviously she thinks im responsible  for getting her fired and has no place to go  she brought her suitcase did you see that   i saw it  she thinks shes staying here  i dont know what she thinks  i dont want the nanny from hell in my house  where did you hear that the blank from hell  that expression  my dad used to say it all the time  you know everything was from hell   no see thats richard lewis  its not richard lewis  my dad has been saying that  richard lewis coined that cheryl  the point is i do not want her here okay  you wouldnt believe what shes been telling me  for the last 20 minutes shes full of nonsequiturs  she tells me she likes to pet horses  she enjoys a good corn dog  enjoys a good corn dog  she takes baths with her socks on  honestly shes got a screw loose somewhere  shes maybe a little eccentric but she seems harmless  wait a second  jeff needs a nanny  susies pregnant their nanny just left   susies pregnant  i havent told you  shes pregnant thats why he moved back  but theyre looking for a nanny   youre not gonna suggest her  well why not  you know nothing about her  she was a good nanny  she didnt get fired for being a bad nanny  she got fired for letting me use the bathroom  if they dont like her they dont have to use her  right they could meet her and  were doing them a favor  this is a winwin situation winwin  you know we gotta stop off and get some spongecake   okay  its my friends birthday   ill buy him spongecake  there you go   you like
