didnt tell you this  he didnt tell you that there was a problem with his kidneys   no he didnt tell me anything  how could he have not told you about this  i dont know but he didnt tell me anything about this  oh jeez  you asked me what it was regarding  i didnt know it was going to be about something like this  but i i wouldnt have said anything you asked me  i could have sworn he told i figured he told you  he didnt say anything to me  oh my god   take it easy  no  could you tell him i called   okay  thanks  what did you do to my assistant   what are you talking about  what am i talking about  shes freaked out shes having a nervous breakdown  and i think she might even quit  its unfuckingbelievable why would you do that  she asked me what the phone call was regarding   its personal  she asked what its regarding i told her  jeez what am i going to do she was a basket case  christs sake  what am i going to do  hey um first of all i want to tell you that uh  i thought about our conversation and uh  ill uh  ill take the test   big fucking deal  thats it  i mean youre my friend  yesterday you should have jumped right on it  youre right youre right but im making up  im making it up now i wanna take the test  just close your eyes and think if it was reversed  youd be really bummed out  let me do that  im closing my eyes but now im asking you  the situations reversed   i need the kidney  yeah  what are you saying would you take the test   id probably want to leap at it  probably leap at it   i  youd leap out the window  let me just say this i would have gone on record at the deli  hello  yeah this is larry david  yeah i was at a jack in the box  yeah pete  oh christ really  well whats the address  so um you know ive decided to take the test   the kidney test for lewis  oh good for you  thats really noble   its the right thing to do  yeah   absolutely  absolutely  i was kind of wondering why youre not doing it   why should i do it  well youre his manager  youre his friend why shouldnt you do it  a lot of people who have managers and friends need kidneys  what does that have to do with anything  i dont even know what that means   youre his friend youre his manager  yeah yeah  youre close to him you should be taking the test too  youre his oldest and closest friend  so its a question of longevity thats it  yeah youre his oldest and closest friend   that makes the most sense  if youre married to your wife for three years  and ive known her for 20  who should give your wife the kidney  ive known her longer  by your logic im the one who should be giving your wife a kidney  if my wife needs a kidney you can give it to her  oh okay so its longevity no matter what  even if youre married to her  no im saying you seemed like you want to give her a kidney  so im gonna let you  you know im loathe to mention this okay  but you are an employee of mine  okay youre really reaching now   youre desperate arent you  a little  yeah i know you dont want to give up your kidney   no why should i  i know well why should i   why should i  well why should i   cause if i am you should too  when did that rule come into effect   whats wrong with it  its not a good rule   its a good rule  no you have to draw a line  kidneys is past the line   hey  mr jones  mr david what are you doing here  its kind of a long story but i had a burger with a  at a jack in the box with some guy and now im his alibi  apparently ive got to spot him in a lineup or something   i dont know  right   really thats not the issue here  its true uhhuh
