of people are doing it tony danza and ted danson  wait a second rob first of all  lm flattered that you would even think of me for this  but rob no one wants to have lunch with me  no you are the guy who created seinfeld   yeah but i mean  the peopled love to be sitting  no ones gonna bid any money its gonna be embarrassing  to go to a larry david lunch  youll be surprised how much money well be able to generate  just by you agreeing to have lunch with them  i just feel like theres a lot of pressure for me to be entertaining  no you dont have to be entertaining just be yourself  and theyll just be thrilled to be with you   if you dont want to  no lll do it  you will great  youll be surprised at how much you go for  surprised lm gonna be  l think youre gonna be surprised at how little i

fascination that people have with the ocean  no  i stare at it for 10 minutes and i go okay i get it  dont you feel calmer  i feel aggravated that lm missing what other people are getting   holy shit

that bathing suit  it is pretty small  how can he walk around in a bathing suit like that  i mean hes at the beach he can wear whatever he wants right   whats he doing  hes just kind of settling in  did you see the back of his bathing suit how does he walk around like that  can we go lets just go  we just got here were not gonna go  thats ridiculous plus if you get up dont you think hell see you then  ive got to stay like this now for the rest of the day  i guess thats up to you  kiss that therapist goodbye  the only question now is do i tell richard lewis   are you sure it was dr weiss  it

association just  thank you for your time  and for donating the lunch we really appreciate it  please whatever you need lll donate anything you want  ill donate it all my time my organs  what do you want you want a kidney ill give it to you  what else do you need  ive got a terrific penis i could donate a penis  ive got good spleen excellent spleen  mr spleen gets rid of dirt and grime  and grease in just a minute  mr spleen will clean your whole house  and everything thats in it mr spleen  lf you change mr to monsieur say monsieur spleen  then youll think that the commercial was  monsieur clean monsieur clean  lts a devastating illness  and we just appreciate everything youve done  ive never heard of it what is it called   groats syndrome  and what does it do  its a nervous system syndrome  that makes people extremely excited and nervous   my niece has it  of course dick groat  named after dick groat  who used to play shortstop for the pittsburgh pirates  i know cause he was a bald guy and he didnt feel very well  cause he was very excited all the time is that it  no the doctor that initially diagnosed it was named groat   you sure it wasnt dick groat  yeah lm pretty sure  dr groat might be dick groats father for all we know   no  no my niece has it and  you might want to check into that  so hes wearing this skimpy kind of speedo bathing suit  his boys are hanging out all over the place  im not going back there no way i cant would you   to the beach  no to the therapist  yours will be ready in just a few minutes sir   mind if i start  he said itll just be a couple minutes  so you dont want me to start is that it  its a couple minutes you dont mind do you  i just think its kind of weird  i mean if you had your food come first  l would say go ahead and start what do i care   i would wait for you to get yours  i wouldnt want you to wait  id be uncomfortable if you waited  id feel it would be polite to wait for your food to arrive  i think its kind of impolite to prevent a person  who is hungry from eating  yeah but were supposed to be having lunch together  do we have to start at the exact same time i dont get that  i dont see why you cant wait two seconds for your cold sandwich its not even hot  i dont see why you care if i take a bite of my food   how does that bother you  because were having lunch together   so what  the two of us  thanks  thanks for switching appointments with me  yeah no problem  larry what happened with that lunch what did you do   im sorry i just  what did you do  i felt so much pressure from the fact that this guy had paid 4000  and i tried too hard to be entertaining and affable  so you told him that groats syndrome  was named after the shortstop for the pittsburgh pirates dick groat  i didnt say that as a fact l speculated because  yeah cause lou gehrig had a disease named after him  and dick groat was a ball player i thought it was a possibility  didnt you read the literature i sent you   that depresses me  then you shouldnt have agreed to do it   i was just having lunch with the guy  i know but larry thats another thing  you start eating before he gets his food  what kind of i mean groats or no groats  l mean where are your manners  i asked if he would mind i was starving   and what did he say  he said he did mind  and you shouldve taken that as your cue to wait  till his food arrived so that you could start eating  meanwhile the guys insulted  i said do you mind if i start he said yes  what kind of person says yes to do you mind if i start  do you know anybody who would do that  he told me he was going to cancel the check  unless you know i was like searching  i said ls there anything we can do to make it up to you  he said maybe if larry would  get more involved and show that he really cared  about groats syndrome maybe then l would agree to give the money  and i suggested lf larry would agree to host  the groats syndrome talent show  maybe he could make it up to you that way  and he said he would agree to make his donation  if you would agree to host the talent show  couldnt i just write the check  larry thats not the point  its not just the giving money  its getting involved you know in groats  its being groats active  its not a big deal all you got to do is you show up  you say a few things you make a couple of jokes  and then you introduce the participants in the show  these are all people by the way with groats syndrome  these are all people who will demonstrate  that you can have a life with groats syndrome  and you can be active and talented and all of that  i dont understand how lunch could come  and its right in front of you and  lf you dont feel like youve done anything wrong  and you dont feel like you have to make it up to them  then fine go your merry way  i dont want you to lose the check  this would go a long way to helping us secure that check  and i think also do quite a bit  in raising some consciousness about groats  they still trust me now they would want me to do that  okay all right good to talk to you  all right thanks a lot   youll think about it  i definitely will   feel good  all right you too   okay i do  goodbye  hello  hello  ive got some  big news  and the news is that  l think lm all better   really  im feeling pretty good  pretty pretty pretty  pretty pretty good   what happened  i had

dont even want to talk about it too much lest i dissipate it  i mean  l see swings of emotion that disturb me a little bit larry  theres no swing im a hammock   a hammock is very placid  a hammock  yeah just gently flowing in the breeze thats me  i must tell you larry  you dont seem to be gently flowing in the breeze  youve been in therapy for a while l know you pretty well  i feel bad that you are such a good therapist  that youre kind of a victim of your own talents and skills  that you have to lose a patient because of the job that you did  its unfortunate lm sorry  i just want to make sure that lm losing you for the reason that youre saying  yeah of course you are  because i know you were at the beach larry  i was not at the beach  so it had nothing to do with the thong   so  hes on to us  he knows about the whole thong thing  he knows about the thong thing   hes on to us  hes on to me  how did this happen hes on to me now   hell be on to you  how did this happen  who told him  i had this lunch with that guy for the charity  and i told him about it  he mustve told rob who told him  why would rob even christ  it must have come up somehow l dont know  so what happened are you out of there   im out yeah  how  i told him i was happy and i didnt need the therapy   you told him what  i told him i was happy  thats what lm telling him how can you steal my termination  i didnt i
