you know what  marla and mark got back together   really  yeah   i know im really happy  good for them  good for them  i thought youd be happy to hear that  thats nice thats nice when did this happen

talked to susie   ive been cutting apples  jeez you know what i just realized  i never followed through on my christmas present to mark  remember i got him a subscription to the times   the new york times  yeah  and then he and marla broke up  i dont know i kinda forgot about it  so you just didnt give him his gift  yeah   because he broke up with his girlfriend  well its yeah  i dont see the point to it  no you just thought that you wouldnt have to worry about it and   you wouldnt see him again so who cares  oh my god  what  ill bet you mark  ill bet you mark is the guy whos taking the paper  no think about it seriously listen think about it  i cant believe it  mark is stealing the paper  holy shit  dont you see look  how long have we not been getting it six days  he moved back in
