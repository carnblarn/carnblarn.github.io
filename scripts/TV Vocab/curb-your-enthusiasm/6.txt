late but i thought the cutoff time   was 1000  no its not  its 930 for us  most people have a 1000 or 1030 cutoff   i think 930 with kids is great  seems like an early cutoff to me   its pretty

cutoff okay   it seems reasonable a 1000 cutoff  please respect that  while im on the subject  who is this schmuck fuckface lawyer you set us up with  i could see how one could interpret that as a serious error in judgment  thats quite correct  thats even an understatement because that guy is costing us how much money  how much is he costing us larry should i be upset about this  theyre just things we can replace everything  theres things we cant replace like my grandmothers brooch   from russia  did he take it  i dont know im gonna check that right now  she brought it over from russia from a pogrom she was in steerage  if thats gone im gonna be hysterical  she worked hard all her life to give that to me  im sorry you walked in on that no dont please   goodbye  no please im begging you   just stay here  i cant stay here  no trust me that fucking brooch better not be missing  its gone you fucking motherfucking  ill kill you jeff youre a cocksucker motherfucker  my grandmothers brooch is missing i could not replace this item  what if something you cared about was missing   you dont give a shit about anything  my baseball cards  all right see now its not so funny anymore  mickey mantle might not be there  like the fucking 3yearold that you are i dont care about the money   will you shut up  fuck you  stay right there i wanna show you something   you got my pad  its

was just so insane i completely apologize  that was crazy but that pad was just so important  it has nine months of ideas in there its like ive wasted nine months of my life  when you were looking around last night  did you see my bracelet  because i cant find my bracelet you know the bracelet that you like  you didnt see it  no but you know whats interesting  cheryl actually was just  jesus christ   this looks bad i know it does  this is my bracelet  cheryl bought the same bracelet that you   julia i swear to you i didnt  why are you doing this  i didnt take your bracelet   thats cheryls bracelet julia  you keep the bracelet now   i dont want it in my house i dont want  dean come on in  dean look its julia louisdreyfus remember this is dean  we went over to his house the other day its

appointments keep it  because now im busy and i cant talk to you anymore  keep your appointments  i think im nauseous shes certainly a lot different on television  you know what shes mad at me not you dont take that personally  that has nothing to do with you okay  its me the point is you met her  you met julia louisdreyfus come on you met julia  thats what you wanted you met her isnt that fantastic   i think thats great  that was terrible  that was maybe an encounter but thats not a meeting  i dont know why youre quibbling about semantics here you met her  it was an unpleasant meeting it wasnt a long meeting  but it was nevertheless a meeting  okay we have a divergence of opinion this happens all the time in law  one person sees it one way another person sees it another way  you saw that as a meeting i saw it as a horrible moment in my life  okay get out  there was a reason i came over   thank you  i found this  does that look familiar at all to you   is that  yeah whered you get this  it was in my house under a cushion by the chair   i was just wondering if that was yours  yeah thank you  theres a reward involved in that  look right in the front part  it says 500 to the person who returns this to l david  i put two and two together and thought the l stood for larry   is that right  ill get a check sherlock   perfect check is fine  maybe you can get yourself a new sweater  its ei  weinstock
