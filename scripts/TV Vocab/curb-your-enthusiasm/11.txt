alexander   youre kidding really  were two months into it  hes phenomenal lm a lucky guy   a tremendous actor  unbelievable  yeah hows he doing  honestly hes kind of struggling right now   is that right  everybody wants george costanza  you know what hes nothing like george  hes nothing at all like  hes the antithesis cause jason is brilliant  and george is an idiot just an imbecile and you know  lts just tough to branch out with that  i mean the range of characters this guy can do   you think hes an idiot  its the classic barnacle  but every sitcom needs that   what have you been up to  nothing  yeah i bet  you got any ideas anything coming down the pike  ive got ideas but i choose not to carry them out  i say we team up you and jason again lets get you guys in a meeting  you should call him  youre not doing anything lets take a meeting  yeah youre not doing anything  lets sit down and just kick around just kick around some ideas   i think its a good idea  dont want to push   nice sweater  thank you its cashmere   really  its not for sale  thats cashmere   100   its nice yeah   lets go see the rest of the place  yeah lets see the rest of it  i love it i really think its

bedroom the downstairs the fireplace  let me ask you something  did you notice that when i asked him about the sweater  he said it was 100 cashmere  theres no way that sweaters 100 cashmere  its like maybe 35 40 50 at the most but 100   that cant be  the sooner the better lm ready to  wait a second do you trust this guy  cause the guys lying about a cashmere sweater  you feel comfortable with that  were not buying a sweater were buying a house  okay listen we have to talk about how much to offer  absolutely  what kind of person lies  about a percentage of cashmere in his sweater  you know fake cashmere and all  l do think its a good idea for you to work with jason  you know i love jason  i just dont want to go back and do tv   come on tv is a great medium  too much work   too much work you

the acting thing is frankly coming a little hard  id love to go back to tv that seems good but i cant shake this george thing  they all see me as george  i mean the thing about it is that youre not even close to george  i tell this to people all the time  you cant imagine what a great actor this guy is  he is nothing like that character   thank you  nothing  i know i go in and i talk to them  and you know i try to present differently  but they see the idiot  they see the schmuck so i dont know  what do you mean schmuck i dont get that  the yutz the idiot   you know  no frankly i dont know  how can you say hes a schmuck a yutz and an idiot  i dont see him that way l just see him as funny  i mean of course it was funny  but he was the fall guy the jackass role  you know this is the guy that never got the girl  he finally gets the girl and he kills her  with the envelope doesnt know what he wants  thats funny thats not schmucky  what is more jerky or putzy than going to a girls house  and stealing a tape out of her answering machine  i went to a girls house  and took a tape out of an answering machine  larry hes eating clairs out of a garbage can  so what i ate an clair out of a garbage can  and masturbation contests four people agreeing  l was in a contest and you know i was in it  so lm a schmuck for being in a masturbation contest  its not an incredibly noble experiment was it  im sorry that you hate the character so much  i dont hate the character lm a little tired of it  i mean lm an actor i have a range of characters that i can play  why am i relegated to this  everywhere i go on the street hey costanza  hey jackass  i just had this idea  i dont know lll throw it out at you okay  for a series an idea for a series okay  you played a character  based on what youre going through now  in other words you play an actor  and the actor is having a tough time getting work  because he was on this megahit series like a seinfeld kind of series  and now this actor after the series goes off the air  he cant get work anymore  because hes so identified with this character  that they wont let him do anything else  and he becomes embittered and grows to hate the character  thats pretty funny  you son of a bitch thats pretty damn good  all right lets do it come on lets go you wanna do it  id like to  im actually working  you working on another thing another show or something  im selling cars  i start on monday  hello   bye  bye  see you in the new house   okay  wish me luck  good luck  anything else you have  if lm closing in on something price always
