one of the forwards  and he threw the towel off he was getting dressed  and i looked down i saw   big yeah  big  uh huge  big they could put the chicago fire out with this  it was it was a joke   well  it was like from another planet  well hes a big guy hes a forward  you need to see a guard did you see a guard  you cant tell by a forward theyre too big out of proportion  i dont care its me and renee  and maybe because maybe because you know  shes black she maybe dates you know  so you think the black woman might be used to a  i mean if theyre used i mean if that if thats not a myth  i could see how it could be a concern  i dont know whether i would ever want to have intercourse  with her because im a little intimidated  and youre one of the few friends i can tell this to  okay well then maybe i can i can step in  i got that 10th anniversary present  im saying if you want to you know  if youre too intimidated to go through with it i could try  a good friend doesnt do that  you dont

slept with a lot of white men and black men im sure   is there any discernible difference  what  let me rephrase that let me rephrase that  yeah rephrase that  is there any discernible difference  between a white man and a black man  you know  why would you ask me something like that larry  my friend wants to know why whats the big deal  i am not gonna answer that  what is that what the fuck what are you doing  its a bug a bug i had a bug on me  look did you get my script to that guy that martin schaffer  everythings okay since you want your little favor   did he get my script  yes he did

great job  you know like for example i got this friend  she just gave a script to me to give to somebody  she said dont let him touch my baby you know thats what they do  you work on something for months and months  then they take it away from you  and then thats it  you never see it again they take your baby from you  they give your baby to somebody else and thats it  youve lost complete contact with your baby  you never see the baby again and its your baby  and they give it to another writer  and that writer doesnt let you even look at your baby  thats part of your job thats what you signed up for  you knew you had to give it away  sort of but its hard to give up that baby  maybe in a few years you can see how your scripts doing  yeah i know but then its all changed  you have nothing to do with it  all right you wanna get some coffee  no way out  it was shocking outrageous insulting  and i loved every minute of it   no way out  hey  how are you how are you  hey  i am
