these lists  then sign ben vereen who cares what you sign come on  your heads bleeding just sign in  yes   hello  dude   what are you doing  what  what are you calling me on the doctors phone for  im bored to death in here  dont use the doctors phone thats not right   whats the big deal  they dont like it  well i just thought id give you a call  see whats up how youre doing what are you reading   mens fest fitness  mens fitness  yeah about americas fattest cities  oh you know what theres the doctor  all right ill talk to you later  i will uh ill talk to you later  that was jeff  youre not supposed to use that phone  sorry it was a local call  youre not supposed to use the phone  it doesnt matter whether it was a local or a long distance call  we just dont want people using that phone okay   whats the big deal if i may ask  its no big deal  whats the problem  there is no problem we just dont want people using that phone  i dont understand why not though  why couldnt i use it  well you could use it you obviously did  we dont want you to use it though  with all due respect i dont understand the rule  i dont see what the big deal is  the history of how we arrived at that  is so complex that i wont even bore you with it  just let it be said that we dont allow anyone  to use the phones in the examination rooms  i just dont see how its hurting anybody  its not hurting anybody  we just have a rule you dont use the doctors phone  i just dont understand what the reason is  youre saying not to use it but whats the reason  i dont understand why you have to know the reason  im just trying to understand why you decided that  it seems very capricious to me  you know its hard to make a rule  that takes in all the contingencies  so we just have a rule dont use the phone   okay  okay   understood  all right glad you understand it  so what happened to you lets have a look  i got hit by a door  wow sit down will you  mel brooks is coming out of a bathroom  and he a swinging door hit me   yeah mel brooks huh  yeah   is it the mel brooks the funny guy  uhhuh  i like mel brooks im a big fan lay down will you   yeah hes great  put your head on the pillow  i have tickets for his play the producers   oh really  yeah   i hear its great  so do i  boy this is a kind of a nasty cut  all right i think all we have to do here is clean this up  and put in a few stitches   oh really  hmmmm  oh okay  again im sorry about the the phone stuff  oh its okay dont worry about it  just if youre ever in a doctors office again dont use the phone  yeah it just seems like an odd policy to me though  its a rule that is universal in examination rooms   you dont use the phone  the rule doesnt make any sense   it makes sense to us  okay fine  we dont have many rules here thats one of them  it seems odd though that if youre making a local call  that anybody would care but whatever  its not the expense of the call were concerned about  i dont know if youve ever had stitches before  but there is a slight bit of pain involved  nothing more i would say than a little prick  yeah theres definitely a prick involved  uh yes there is a prick involved  yeah theres one prick involved  yeah id say there is one prick involved  i agree im not a doctor but i agree there is one prick  yep  and the more i look at this i think this is pretty minor  what the hell  you drooled on me  so have you thought about anybody for the 10th anniversary present  i have been thinking about it  and  you know i got three months  im gonna take my time  and wait wait for the right one  and you my fat friend will be the first to know  all right good i should be  my big fat friend  hmm fatso yeah fatso  oh hey  did you get your wallet   yeah how did you know about that  i found it   wait

quote i found this  she said she found the wallet gave it to me and i gave her 100 bucks  seriously you should worry a little bit less about the wallet  and maybe maintain a little focus on your driving skills buddy  hello  jeff greene larry david to see mel   okay  okay  you know i ran into the guy in the wheelchair downstairs  your friend dennis  he told me that you said that you found the wallet  and he gave you 100 reward  whats up with that   how dare you come in here  how dare i  and accuse me  hey whats going on  this is the guy that i told you about  oh you got a problem with our lifestyle   that we want to adopt a baby  not at all  yeah you need a good fuckin ass kicking  thats what you need you want to name our baby tang  you think its good to name a kid after a breakfast
