to get upset  we have a policy in this office that you are seen as you sign in  what is it like a bakery you pick a number   the first number goes  its first come first serve  why dont you have a ticket we can all take numbers   why even give out the appointments  sir calm down please  for this policy you dont need appointments  the policy of the office is you are seen as you come in  that way

rule  excuse me  im sorry to bother you but i did a nice thing for you  i held the elevator for you so you can get on first   and then i was a gentleman i let you out  right  you came down the hall
