looked over and she looked at your crotch  she looked at it she looked down  what was her reaction   like it was awkward  there was a little twinkle  youre sure that she looked over and thought that you were excited   thats really weird   i know its very weird  its very creepy   i told you about these pants  i know its just material its obvious  its not obvious look  she didnt say anything to you about it   you didnt say anything  no there was no time the movie started  and you werent   what  you werent aroused   no look at this  im making sure  i told you about the pants you didnt believe me

apology letter  what a job you have you have to write people letters   i know  its ridiculous  its crazy kathys the only one i dont understand  what if kathy called you up  and said that she wanted me to write a pilot for her  and you said no i wasnt available without consulting me  if my wife ever asks me again which im sure she will thats what i could tell her   thats why you said you were sorry  great wonderful   you like that  yes very much   its quite good isnt it  so were lying together  so thats our story in case my wife ever talks to you kathy  kathy griffin called him up  and he said i couldnt write the pilot for her  without even asking me hes an idiot   who is  you are im talking to my wife now  hes a big fat idiot   big fat idiot  come on  tell her im an idiot dont say im a fat idiot   im kidding  could you do me a favor   write me a letter of apology  i will  for calling me a fat idiot listen  the other night when you called your wife hitler my parents were in the back  we

 can you do me a favor this afternoon come by the house  and apologize to my parents its for me theyre here for another week  my dad wants me to drop you as a client  he keeps telling me every day
