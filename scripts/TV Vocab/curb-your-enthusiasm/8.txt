                 im so sorry  thank you so much for coming   its so good to see you  thank you so much  thank you  oh gosh thank you   im so sorry about your aunt  it was cheryls aunt  but thank you  did you fly in from florida  no her sister and her sisters boyfriend and her parents flew in   i live here  i see condolences   nice service  yeah  thanks for the hotel room i appreciate that  please my pleasure  i was gonna ask you is that minibar  is that included with the whole thing   sure whatever you want  great  help yourself some mms toblerone   i dont drink  its chocolate   hows cheryl holding up  i think shes okay  cut my finger this morning trying to put that  make a hole in my belt i must have lost weight or something  its killing me   its a good family  yeah theyre very nice   beckys a nice girl right  shes a doll shes really sweet  how long did you date before  you and cheryl got married  not that long we were friends for a while and then  after we had intercourse we got married very quickly  becky really wants to get married  and im not into it  and the day that we got the call i was gonna break up  i was over there to break up with becky  holy cow so you flew out here  and you wanted to already be free  i missed it  by five minutes  my gosh and then you couldnt do it after she killed herself  what do think would be the appropriate time  for somebody to wait till they  till i tell her  if it was her mother id ask you to go back on the plane and wait  maybe six days a week  for an aunt for an aunt who doesnt even live where you live  who you dont see that often  i think you could do it when you get home  when you get back to florida  what should i say  just tell her youre not happy thats very good that works  ive never actually used it myself but i think it works   okay  ive got a breath problem what  no i thought i saw a bug thats creepy  we never had this conversation by the way   no  okay  i wont say anything  thanks for your advice  i think i got the heat  turned down a bit   what were you and craig talking about  louise   is he okay  yeah  you would be very surprised how broken up he is about this   hes been very quiet for several days  thats so sweet   the service was wonderful wasnt it  yeah it worked out nicely  thank you  listen you guys  i want you to know if you want to stay a couple of extra days in the house  thats fine dont worry about it  you could stay another day in the hotel   thats really nice stay there a night or two  yeah one night  that would be nice because we hate flying   neither of us like to fly  yeah nobody likes to fly  i dont even like to drive and i dont like walking  so occasionally i dont really know what mode of transportation to  im not sure what we can do about this  but we were a little upset that there was no obituary   i didnt even think of that  like she didnt have a life out here  it sort of makes it real  my friend my manager actually knows somebody at the paper   i could get something in there for you  that would be so good   thatd be really sweet  ill write it myself  ill take care of the whole thing no problem  theres anything you want to add tell me ill get it in  its not gonna be funny is it   mom please  thats what he does  its not gonna be funny itll be very tasteful and appropriate   itll be fine  hes a writer he can do anything   thank you so much  we love you larry  i love you too   sorry im late  its understandable  its very hard to extricate myself from mourners   why are you still wearing the tie  i dont know  if i didnt have to i wouldnt  once youve got the outfit on you might as well wear it to its completion   maintain the outfit  to its completion  so you think you can take care of this this obituary thing   done deal  really   you get it to me by 400 and ill fax it over to him   thanks so much  no problem   very nice of you  its my pleasure  thatll score some big points with the family   how did she die  killed herself   no she didnt  killed herself   why  nobody knows she didnt leave a note   that is so rude isnt that  thats really rude  if you leave your house for 10 minutes to get a container of milk  you tell somebody where you went  i let my wife know before i go anywhere  would it have killed her to leave a note   i dont know  my moms in town with my dad  its her birthday  itd be great considering whats happened between you and them  if for my moms birthday you got her a little gift  doesnt matter what it is its a nice gesture  it really is  any ideas  no   okay  good  lets do this obituary thing okay you have a pad   yeah i got a pad  okay  louise hoenin hoenln  devoted sister  beloved aunt  died of undisclosed causes  it only took us about 20 minutes door to door   did very well  yeah thats unusual  i wasnt worried because i have unlimited mileage on my rental car   i wouldnt care how long it was  thats good  we were surprised the freeway was virtually empty   you can really get stuck in traffic for hours  yeah  sometimes it gets so bad you can hardly breathe  thats for sure  im glad i dont live here   do you think beckys coming down soon  i think so  shes been on the phone all morning with her boyfriend  now her exboyfriend  he broke up with her last night and  isnt that awful larry   what kind of timing its unbelievable  lousy  anyway i have the unlimited mileage  so i think im gonna go out for a while   is that okay  where are you going  i was thinking about playing some golf  are you joking  im not contributing anything im detracting   you are  im a minus here im not a plus  if your aunt died i would be right by your side to support you  if my aunt killed herself id encourage you to leave the house  id say go have some fun you dont have to stay here and mourn   i would keep you around to mourn  youre not going golfing  i know were all going to miss louise   yeah  very much so  but we have to continue   we must go on  we must go on  cant go on  must go on  laughter is a great healer and youve gotta have a smile  you get over a lot of things that way  i once performed for norman cousins in his hospital room  when he was on his deathbed he requested me to do five minutes  and i bombed actually and he got much worse  and he had to watch some marx brothers movies to actually resuscitate him but  you know whos funny that carrot top have you seen that guy  he comes on the tonight show once in a while   big mop of red hair  my gosh   the obituary do we have the paper  yeah we want to look at that  okay ill go get the paper   no dont you bother ive got the car  you dont even know where it is  i have unlimited mileage i can drive anywhere  he knows what hes doing   its right around the corner hell find it  im sure he will  gives him pleasure to use the rental car anyway  you could move over a little bit now because hes not sitting there anymore   get a little more room here  thats okay   these are pretty good  yeah   how many can i get in my mouth at a time  six   you say six  five  three four  look what they did to my santino  gladys george look what they did   sugar  no becky   no  oh my gosh  what did he say what happened  he just kept repeating something about not being happy  we couldve worked through that   the nerve of this guy  jerk   what kind of timing is this  i just buried my aunt   i know  and he breaks up with me   you dont do that to somebody  no  thats so awful   i mean he really loved me  yeah  did he say anything to you  i know how much he likes you i just thought maybe  no we just you know  he talked about aunt louise and the minibar  the minibar  oh gosh   this is ridiculous  where are you going  ive got to get a birthday present for jeffs mother  im sorry i forgot todays her birthday ill be right back im sorry  oh god all right im gonna be back in 20 minutes  everybody stay here okay  gladys youre here okay barbara george right here  gladys ill be right back im just gonna get a birthday present   im

beautiful all right   really  sure come on   let me get you a case  i dont fool around  give you a case ill throw in some lens cleaner   how would you like to pay  credit card   can you giftwrap these  no im sorry we dont wrap  how would one go about getting this giftwrapped   get some wrapping paper and wrap it  okay where would i get the paper  you know theres a card store upstairs you could maybe go there   you need a scissor too right  a scissor   you need a scissor to cut the paper right  to cut the paper yeah   and scotch tape too right  right   do they sell all that in the same store  no i dont believe they do  you could check  if youre gonna go get that stuff you might wanna get a bow  and a card  a bow and a card  yeah so she knows who the gift is from  im gonna be handing her the gift isnt it obvious  you dont have to have a card im just saying  what a process this is a bow and a card  where do you get them  is that in the same store as the scissor and the scotch tape   no the card  how many stores are we talking about  i really dont know  boy this is very complicated  what  what we got a paper thats what  devoted sister beloved cunt   thats what you put in the paper  this is a typo   it should be aunt  did jeff look at this before he turned it in  they have proofreaders at papers  the woman leads a decent life and this is how she ends up beloved cunt  my wife is upset  im just glad you werent in charge of the headstone  i meant beloved aunt not beloved cunt   dont keep saying it  please  im so sorry im so sorry  its a typo dont you see its a typo  its a typo its aunt  excuse me for a second  i just got off the phone with craig and i wanted see if this rings any bells  it wasnt her mother who died it was just her aunt  you should break up with her today  you dont look happy you should break up   what  thats what he said  did you tell craig to break up with becky  he talked to me but i told him to wait till he got back to tallahassee   i didnt say to do it last night at the wake  never mind   what is the matter with you  hes a bad guy i was doing you a favor  i think you should just leave  you mean for tonight  at least please  i am sorry  you know how i can get this giftwrapped  let me ask you something  how would one go about getting this giftwrapped   do you have the paper  no i dont have anything  you could probably go to a stationery store  stationery store for the scissor and tape  but you gotta go someplace else for the paper   depending on what kind of paper you want  i dont give a shit  then you should probably go to a party store  where you can get giftwrapping paper  but they dont have the tape and scissor  i dont know they might i wouldnt bet on it i would bring my own  let me ask you a question  if i brought the scissor and the tape to this party store youre talking about   they have the paper would they wrap it for me  they might honestly i dont know because my wife wraps everything  but if you bring it with you if you have it there  if you just tip them or something  how would you go about getting something like this giftwrapped   just go to a hallmark or something  a stationery store  thats for the paper they dont have the scissors and the tape   they will  they got scissors and tape   really  ribbon and bows and cards   they have everything there  hallmark has that whole thing there  wheres the hallmark  i dont know   you gotta fix this pump over here  okay  all right forget it im all done here  you dont know where the hallmark is  i thought maybe tomorrow if youre up to it wed go to the outlet center   all right  hi look whos here   hello  hi   hi  be nice   hi  hi  happy birthday  that was sweet of you  what kind of present is that not wrapped nicely  yeah im sorry about that  i
