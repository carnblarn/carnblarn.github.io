kind of crossroads  you dont call me im always initiating  i ask you to do things i ask you  whatever i do its always coming from my end  and i feel like if i never called you  id fall off the face of the earth and we wouldnt be friends anymore  my shrink actually told me to confront you on this and i am thats it   can i be honest with you  i hope so   its sofia its your girlfriend  sofia  i dont get along with her  and so i tend not to call or get together  you actually think thats fair i mean this is my girlfriend  i dont know if its fair but thats whats stopping me   thats why i havent been calling  shes an extension of my life  its like i love your wife  shes embarrassed me a couple of times even in jest and i dont say  i dont wanna be your friend anymore  i dont know i just dont think a friend can just bolt from a friendship  cheryl and i are going out to dinner tonight why dont the two of you join us   why do you wanna do that  cause i wanna make up start all over   really  yeah  youre not just doing this to i appreciate it but shes part of my life  i know and i wanna try and be friends with her  this is a very nice gesture tonight  fuck i cant were doing something early  can

happening  im sorry im funky  dr grambs this is my friend larry david   this is my dermatologist  really  what for 15 years already  even with the whole affirmative action thing  im sorry i beg your pardon what   what do you mean  it was a joke  what do you mean the whole affirmative action thing  it was a joke  hes like a buddy  i know him hes a sweetheart  the implication being that i wasnt good enough to be a dermatologist  no come on it was joke  hes a liberal hes like you and me  so if i wasnt black he would have said the same thing or not  do you see my point  i see it in a historical sense but not in a niceday sense  you know richard ive worked too hard and too long at this i cant do it  i dont know what his trip is but i cant do it  i dont have any trip no it was joke  holy shit what hit you  it was a joke  i know its a joke but you sounded  like pat buchanans gym partner  i was just trying to be affable  ill see you tonight hopefully well resolve you know  i tend to say stupid things to black people sometimes  thats like gonna be in the time capsule  ill see you later on  i was just trying to be affable  im so glad youre here i know this place is crazy  theres no tables you couldnt get a reservation  were on a waiting list  can you give me my prescription  i think im gonna go to the ladies room and put some on   what  i forgot it  im sorry i was so discombobulated because  oh my god i completely humiliated   what happened  i was with richard lewis  and we were talking and then he ran into his friend this black doctor  and i made some terrible joke about affirmative action  it was beyond awful  im sure youre making it out to be more than it was  im making it out to be less believe me and he took it the wrong way  why would you even make a joke about that  i dont know i was trying to be affable i was trying too hard  why even joke about it  i made a mistake it was a stupid thing to say  im a schmuck i did a schmucky thing   did you apologize  of course i apologized  i have to say im not real happy right now because  well have dinner and then well go right to the drugstore   no problem  the problem is  its gonna be hours before

what do you think  yeah sure   men do this right  ive seen men do it   havent we seen this  ive seen men do it in movies  good evening sir welcome to the byzantine  i was curious about how long is the wait  im afraid it looks like 45 minutes to an hour   no were very crowded this evening sir  my wifes itching you know   right now were very full  nothing else can be done  nothing that i can think of sir  things are done right arent things done i hear things are done  from time to time  anything you can do  actually i think we can accommodate you right now would you like to follow me  thank you  thank you very much   enjoy your dinner  okay   im pretty impressed  come on give it to me   im very very impressed i really am  no big deal  i am extremely attracted to you right now   thats cause its criminal  is it  women are attracted to criminals and they do that all the time  you could do that just walk around cut in line any time you want  all right do it all the time and well never have to wait  should i feel guilty about it  why because all those people are still waiting  i cant stop to think about it because im starving  how can a handicapped person use a nonmotorized wheelchair  i dont get that  whats the point to it to me thats your big priority  maybe he likes the exercise   im sure you get used to it  cant he get one that has both  motor and nonmotor  you can do both you want exercise or the motor you got it  this way has no options you gotta do this the whole time  if youre not in a hurry to get somewhere why not   theres ted harbert  whos ted harbert  he used to be the president of abc now he runs nbc studios  i have to go to the bathroom im gonna have to walk right by that table   whats wrong you dont like him  he just makes the worst small talk  and its gonna be so ill never get out of there  just dont stop just keep walking and say hello  you have to stop you cant just say hello and walk on   you know what  sea bass  theres a restaurant two doors down im

the line producer   yes i remember  thats right  you know what im so glad i ran into you  cause we had a really nice meeting you said my resume looked great  and you said i was qualified and then i didnt hear from you  all these years i wondered what happened cause i really wanted to work with you  and what was the persons name that got that job   what was  barry   barry a friend of yours  friend of my wife   a friend of your wife a black friend  no  this is the thing  i had a couple of margaritas but im not gonna hold back  i just was wondering  why do you have a problem giving somebody like me a job  what a problem what are you talking about  theres a lot of people interviewed for that  yeah but you and i we had a rapport  we did but the guy knew my wife thats all it was  i know what youre implying but thats really awful   what youre saying is terrible  what im saying is  i watched your show seinfeld for seven eight years and not one black person  i lived in new york for years theres a plethora of black people there  but somehow elaine or jerry never had any black girlfriends  in their circle of friends nobody looks like me  what is that about is it a black thing with larry david  theres no black thing its a nothing  no a sister like me can see through things like this  and i want you to know that i got your number now  theres no number you dont have a number i dont have a number  i saw sour grapes and the title was very apropos  maybe it was a blessing in disguise that i did not get that job  i just hope you have a very nice dinner thank you mr larry david

 completely in favor of it  i dont think white people should have anything  i think we should be sleeping on the street eating crumbs and we should be that way  for a couple of hundred years and im not even joking about that  guys hes a comedian he makes funny lines all the time i overreacted  and he knocked it off the top off his head  hes much better when he has a chance to write it and look
