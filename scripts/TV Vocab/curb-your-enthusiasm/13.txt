purposes  so what so youd rather have them toiletpaper your house  i didnt know that it was gonna be felony or treat  i didnt think the trick extended to felony  why would it kill you to just give them a few pieces of candy  i dont understand that  because theres gotta be some kind of cutoffs   for halloween to work  what is it with you and your cutoffs  and your shouldnt there be and should there be who cares  trickortreating at 40  free candy lm 40 years old l want free candy  not everybody knows your rules  you got a set of rules and you think everyones gonna adhere to them  but theyre

 im just using elvira to describe her thats all  its just a way to lts a shorthand  they knocked on the door they said trick or treat   yeah  and you had treats  yes  i was giving out candy all night  but i dont have to give them candy they dont deserve candy  and i dont deserve this bald asshole  thats a hate crime were a set were a group  you cant call us bald assholes  what if i were gay would
