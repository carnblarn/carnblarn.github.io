the temple  okay  jesus that guy almost broke my hand with that shake  you dont whisper to me please dont  i said he almost broke my hand with that handshaking  you know little time once in a while  if you  if youre pleasant to people  whats the matter   get a drink of water  take some water   its ok pop   i think youre gonna be alright  i got your glasses  well your dad has had a mild stroke   really   yes but hes going to be fine  ive got him lightly sedated right now  and hes resting  but hes doing very very well  and theres nothing for you to worry about   okay  absolutely   my feeling is we may do a little corrective surgery  i dont know exactly when  but well have him here for a while   its much better  let me ask you a question  my dad and i were eating in the deli  earlier and uh  actually they named a sandwich after me   no kidding   yeah i got my own sandwich    that is great   im up on the board  the larry david if you go in there  oh ive seen that on the menu everybodys got their sandwich  yes but you know the bad news is that  i cant stand the sandwich between you and me   what is it   i see you recoiled a little bit was it a breath thing    no no not at all  you put your head back a little bit   not at all no  but anyway is it   heres my question  okay  is it possible that the sandwich  could have had something to do with the stroke  if the sandwich was caught  and he started choking and couldnt breath  and then became fearful i guess its possible  he could raise his blood pressure  his life is not threatened hes fine and hes resting so  the sandwich gave him a stroke  how do you like this   the sandwich   do you mind if i  you know im a big fan of seinfeld   i dont know if it bothers you  why would it bother me    it was a wonderful show  thank you  i tell you what  im gonna do your father surgery for you  im chief sugery usually i  delegate it to somebody else but  i would be happy to do this for you  thank you  now youre a golfer right   i cant believe that sandwich might have been responsible for this  im so sorry  whitefish  why did he have to give me whitefish   there are so many other sandwiches  pastrami tuna i would have taken tuna   even with the mercury  it stinks in here  you know what i think its smell from the onion   you want a mint   take a mint  no mint   i got a whole hand full of them  what   what   what is it

for a second   i have an idea maybe itd be more funny  i suspected this a long time i really did  the only thing the only noticeable thing i have in common with him  honest to god is my penmanship i noticed theres a similarity  isnt there something with the stroke with oxygen to his brain or something    come on adopted   dont ruin this for me    im not trying to ruin it for you  dont rain on my parade    hey look whos here   hey   hey man   cant shake bad fingers  im so bummed out  im awful in this   its not you  im not funny anymore   its the writing  why are you here by the way   oh we
