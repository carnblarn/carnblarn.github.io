military buddies   from the air force  he was in the war  what did he do in the war   he was a pilot  really what kind of a pilot   a kamikaze pilot  wow  wouldnt he be dead  um not all of them died  i know but kamikaze pilot  kind of implies that  you know a kamikaze pilot is a pilot who crashed and died right   but he didnt  he survived yes   thank goodness for that  he survived   heres to what did you say  kanpai  but what happened exactly  did he try and crash the plane into a ship  ahem he grazed the ship  okay   all right  all right he grazed the ship  he grazed it  is that because there was some kind of malfunction with the plane  it doesnt really matter he grazed it   im just curious  and he lived and   and he is alive  and hes alive  yeah but at the last second what happened  was he coming down all of a sudden he said  jesus this kamikaze business might not be for me  i think maybe ill go back to base   okay you know its  was is something like that huh  so what happened at the

played in that bingo game  have you ever noticed anything strange going on there  i need to talk to you larry  dont dont try to get involved  dont try to pretend youre concerned   i was concerned  concerned  when we went to the hospital i come back  you guys are all still playing poker smoking cigars and eating pizza  thats precisely why we were there because we were concerned  we wanted to show you support so when you got home your buddies would be there  and youre turning it into a bad thing  yoshi tried to commit suicide  and you just completely put it out of your head  we didnt put it out of our head  we thought of it between hands  heres what you should be concerned about  youre the reason why yoshi tried to commit suicide  come on hows that possible  the whole kamikaze thing  i was curious about it so i asked  excuse me for having a curious mind that asks questions of people  im curious about how you can be a kamikaze pilot  and still be alive  theres a lot of kamikaze pilots that are still alive  you say that and i say to you  they are not kamikaze pilots  he grazed the ship  that sounds to me like  i think i might head home this is fucking insane  you taunted him you called him chicken  i didnt call him chicken   i ordered chicken  you called him chicken  i ordered chicken you idiot theres the difference  heres the difference   youre a chicken ill have some chicken  youre a chicken id like a piece of chicken  well he understood it as you calling him a chicken  he must have taken it the wrong way  and what about you coming and sweeping the chips off the table  you cost me a lot of money  i know for a fact you were down 300  you actually owe me 300 if you wanna get technical about it  ill tell you what ill get your chips back  youll get your money back but youre gotta do one thing  you gotta call yoshi at home hes home right now  and apologize for the whole kamikaze statement  and the chicken thing  okay i will   okay im gonna call him and apologize  okay  ill use my dads phone  hello  oh hey yoshi this is larry david  oh hello larry  im actually  im calling to apologize  im sorry if i said anything that might have been inappropriate  i didnt i didnt really mean anything  to happen i was just kinda curious  with the whole kamikaze thing   you know i hope  are you eating something  im eating pistachio nuts  youre eating pistachio nuts while youre apologizing to me  yes so  you cant be sincere about apologizing and then snack on pistachio nuts  what i can eat and apologize  theres no pistachio crunching in apologizing  i respectfully disagree ive snacked and apologized many times in the past  and everyones always accepted it quite graciously  well that might be the way you do things in your family  but we dont snack and apologize  what is that a japanese thing  no no thats a human thing  hey did you mention me in that suicide email   hi  oh larry im glad to see you   how are you dr skadden  im good hows your dad   i think hes doing well  if think hes doing real well  im gonna write him a little prescription though   maybe you want to have it filled  okay  a little blood thinner  you know im kinda glad i ran into you  i wanna talk to you a little bit about something that happened to me today   and lets keep this between the two of us okay  sure  in the bingo game today  i won i yelled bingo  lenore the woman who runs the game came over  looked at my card and said she didnt call one of the numbers  now look i can hear better than anybody in that room okay  she called my number  i listen i pay attention  im a good bingo player  a minute later ruth wins  lenore came over and she gives the dollar to her friend  and dont tell me after that game  her friend ruthie wasnt giving her 50 all right  i won that game fair and square fair and square  okay so larry you think lenore is taking kickback  from calling the numbers is that what youre saying  yes i think the bingo game is fixed  i think lenore  is either in cahoots with ruth or maybe even a few other people i dont even know  you know what you should do  take off your little smock here  take off your tie sit in on a game  keep your ears open keep your ears open listen  to see whos winning at the bingo game  you want me to go undercover to play bingo is that what youre saying  do you know anything about this game doctor  that
