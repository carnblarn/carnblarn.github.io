shame  yeah yeah  well thats uh   hey rabbi  yeah  um can i discuss  a private matter with you  please anything im a rabbi  anything you want to say  before we got married  my wife told me  that if we stayed together for 10 years  that for our  as a present to me  she would let me have  relations with another woman  just one time  and this is like this is a gift to you   its like i have total permission  yeah  shes almost kind of challenging me in a way  in a kind of demeaning way she doesnt think im suave enough   oh really  and i want to  its the only opportunity ill have for the rest of my life  ive never cheated on her i never would cheat  this is all on the up and up   so youre conflicted about it  yes yet i kind of  ill be honest it would be nice  you know what comes to my mind larry  what comes to my mind  is the story of abraham and sarah  sarah could not conceive and said to abraham  go in to your handmaiden hagar  and have relations with her  abrahams wife said that to him   yeah absolutely  get the hell outta here  its right there in genesis  i think that you can look at that as a very real precedent  this womans never gonna replace your wife   shes not gonna mean anything  of course not   so i mean theres no danger of that  no  its not an act of love anyway   its lust  so so you know  lovei dont know what that has to do with sex   yeah well it has a lot to do but  yeah for sure  i would say that shes giving you something out of generosity  and i think you should probably  accept it in that same sense of generosity  and im not a bad person if i do it  no no youre not a bad person if you  im a bad person anyway but im not  am i an extra bad person  no it does not make you an extra bad person  ive got to start coming to temple more often  im glad i could be helpful with this  thank you thank you so much  youre very welcome youre very welcome  ill see you tomorrow night for dinner  yes im looking forward to that oh listen larry  i was talking to a

  the guy with the glass eye  oh right   remember him  yeah  you think thats a good idea  do survivors like seeing each other  do they like to talk about old times  or does the sight of another survivor depress them  i think you should invite him   invite him  i guess if i was a survivor   id want to see somebody  somebody you have a shared experience  yeah talk about see thats the thing  do they want to i dont know  how are your vows coming along  i just havent had that much time   to really work on it yet  this is important to me  the whole things gonna be embarrassing  you didnt tell

past your shortcomings  and appreciate all of the goodness you possess  we promise to continue loving each other unconditionally  not only throughout this lifetime  but after death through all eternity   we stand before you  huh wait a second   what  what was that about eternity  um  well love each other throughout this lifetime  but after death through all eternity  you mean this is  this
