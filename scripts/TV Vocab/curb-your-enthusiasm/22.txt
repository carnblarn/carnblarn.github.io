about the way she looks  would you show up at an event  would   with a person that looks like she has a macaroni salad  about the soul you love her soul and all that  part of that is true but this is unbelievable  i have to what kind of fucking why cant she take a benadryl  these people what are they doing i dont understand this attitude  i dont understand it either  take a benadryl shell be better in five minutes  can you imagine me getting out of the limo with my date  shes pretty hell bent on going too  shes got the dress i got the dress   you know i know i know  shes ready  yeah know what would match her head  a dress made of turnips and blood you know  oh god shes so hideous she should look in the mirror  does she even know what she looks like   she denies it its a denial thing  why dont you take her ltll be fun  oh thats very oh yeah mr big shot   why dont you take her  what do we do you gotta help me out  you gotta get a shot and stick it in her ass   shes not a racehorse  you gotta get a shot of benadryl  while shes sleeping or shove it down her throat  like a hit man a benadryl hit man  put it in the brownie that she ate  wait a minute why not put it in   put it in the brownie  thats a fucking brilliant idea   a brilliant idea  yeah because   yeah its a fucking  what the benadryl brownie  first of all she will never know  ive got news for you even if she got better  they would think it was because of the prayer  thats fantastic  well i mean you could do it it wouldnt be hard  what are they gonna throw me in prison  all i have to do is get the recipe from susie  cheryl would bake them put it in wed just give her the brownie   larry what are you doing here  hey you got a dog  well we need protection its me and sammy in the house alone  hes a good boy this is oscar  oscar oskieboy hey oskieboy   dont get him excited okay  okay  yeah you just stop by you dont call  no i tried to call but my cell phone couldnt get through   interference  thats a piece of crap that one   i had that one i got rid of it  really  whos that isnt that somebody in the car   its richard lewis  oh oh  so what what do you want  actually this may sound a little strange  but we had a dinner party the other night  and jeff brought over some of your brownies  wait a minute  jeff brought brownies that i made to a dinner party   yeah at my house  larry i baked those brownies  specifically for sammy to take to school the next day  and they were gone i had no idea what the hell happened  jeff stole he stole his childs brownies larry  you see what were dealing with here  he stole brownies out of the mouth of his baby  its a testament to the brownie thats what youre not seeing  because theyre incredible brownies  if they were mediocre brownies he wouldnt have taken them   well thats true  which leads me to why im here  i would love if you could give me the recipe   the brownie recipe  the brownie recipe   i cant do that darling i cant  no no no of course you can  no i cant because its a secret family recipe  my grandmother handed down to me i cant  susie susie susie look who youre talking to here  im talking to larry david  yeah the guy who never ever tells anybody anythng  i am known for that strangers come up to me  to tell me their deepest secrets  well thats good to know for future reference  for other things that i might need to trust you with  but this is a secret what does that mean to you  okay okay secret secret secret  ill tell you a secret how about that nobody knows not even cheryl  well if youd like to tell me   i might be losing a testicle  youre kidding me  its not definite the point is im telling you  im sharing something with you because i trust you   the way you can trust me  i cannot give you the recipe   no you can  no i cant  i cant my grandmother okay may she rest in peace  entrusted that brownie recipe to me  and youre asking me to break a sacred confidence  its not the manhattan project you know  its just a little a recipe  go get a mix or something youre asking too much  you ask way too much i cant oscar come  i just told you im gonna lose a ball  okay so  you want to put some benadryl in some brownies  a lot of benadryl  are you kidding  whats the downside  think of it its like its an act of humanity  on your part im begging you  arent you guys supposed to be going to the emmys tomorrow night   why what  richard  is that what this is about larry because you dont want  to take her to the emmys because of the way she looks  why should he take her shes hideous i dont blame him  are you guys out of your mind  why  its not only that i want her to get better  its 90 you dont have to lie to her   its not 9010  its 8515   no no 7525  its not even that  tell her the truth youre embarrassed to be seen with her  and i dont blame him so what she takes a little benadryl  you put it in the brownie big deal  why dont you buy some brownies put it in and leave me out of this   we went over this  you know anything about tampering  huh do you know anything about tampering  you cant do that because the brownie will fall apart  its gotta be in the mix when you make the brownie  maybe you guys should take care of this yourself   how can we  i cant bake   leave me out of this  i dont know how to bake  what do you mean they have to be baked they have to be baked  dont you think shes gonna taste benadryl in the brownies  its totally tasteless theres no taste to this stuff  theres no taste to it i spoke to the pharmacist  oh you asked him if you put this in brownies  will someone be able to taste it  theres no taste to it at all  theyre odorless and tasteless  my heart is breaking for her big head  its grotesque its like she should be in a carnival on coney island  im telling you  this is the dumbest idea i have heard in a long time  you know what its a good idea cause if it works  she thinks the prayer did it  thats whats so smart about it  now the idea is a genius idea  its not like how did i get better all of a sudden   it was their religion  yeah it was their religion   prayer worked  yeah  and you know what it happened in our house   okay  okay  all right i think we should you know  all right i just want to talk to her for a second  all right cheryl  all right thanks for doing this i guess this is stupid   do you not think this is stupid  its not such a big deal  lets not make a big deal about it okay its not really a big deal   its another day in paradise for me  dont do it if thats how you feel  no ill do it ill do it just go  can you bake this stuff i dont even know
