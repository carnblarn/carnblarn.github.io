right there  thats omars boy  what the fuck can i tell him whatever the man wants to hear jimmy  prodigal son  major we got a good shot at clearing a couple of cases here  one were not here to talk cases  i dont care about your cases sit  relax  im a reasonable guy  in fact everywhere i go people say to me  bill rawls you are a reasonable fucking guy  am i right jay you are reasonable sir  yes yes i am  and because your sergeant knows me to be reasonable  he came in here a couple weeks ago and reasoned with me right jay  we reasoned we did  we reasoned that despite his negligible lrish ancestry  and a propensity to talk out of turn jimmy mcnulty is a good worker  probably worth saving  major im not hes a goodlooking kid huh  do you know what we do here mcnulty  what we do here  that was one of them what is it a question you dont have to  a rhetorical question  you were being rhetorical rhetorical and reasonable sir  we work murder cases here as they come in one at a fucking time  its called a rotation  youre up till you catch one then you step down work it for a while  someone else steps up  its a simple but effective way to do business  in a town that has 250 to 300 cases a year  yes sir  but if someone gets it into his head to leave the rotation  it puts an unfair burden on other detectives who have to pick up their casework  overworked cops make mistakes  mistakes lower the unitwide clearance rate  and that can make someone who is otherwise as reasonable as me  unreasonable  detective mcnulty i expect to see your ass back here next week  when your shift rotates

your honor so noted  we will contend that it was preston who was the victim of a brutal police beating  indications of which are still evident on him your honor  he struck back wildly and in selfdefense your honor  and the walkaway  preston was heavily medicated when he left the cheltenham facility  in that state your honor  he was simply trying to get back to see his grandmother  did you know what you were doing when you left the boys village son  no i was messed up anything else youd like to add  just  i dont know  im ready to be good  pending a hearing on these charges to be scheduled within six months  im putting the respondent on home monitoring with his grandmother  your honor im afraid mrs brodus doesnt have a telephone  for any monitoring calls shes on a fixed income

your friend  avon is one sick bastard  of course he had his reasons  for one thing you all did take his stash  for another hes looking for you omar  thats what all the cigarette burns were about  the broken fingers and cracked forearms  he wanted your boy to give you up  an address a street  kid had heart  yeah  i know you want to go to wherever it is you lay your head  and pick up that sawedoff you like so much and go on the hunt  thats how a man like you wants to carry  you wouldnt be wrong no you wouldnt  but one man with two barrels aint enough omar  now youre going to do what youre going to do  but whatever else you can give us on barksdale and his people  that can go to hurting him too  just throw us what you can  let me tell you all something all right  what i do i do straight like that  aint no sense in you all troubling yourselves over that  cause the way i feel right now today  what do you all need from me  when did you last see brandon  tuesday around 700 maybe later  he was on his way down to mindamin  and the greeks after that  everybodys talking about he got snatched up from there  the greeks on baltimore street  yeah he liked to play the pinball games to death  he go alone  yeah and i didnt like it none neither  but you can only treat a young man like a boy for so long before they book  when bailey got killed  you must have figured barksdale was coming back on you  bailey please  that niggers enemies got enemies  i just figured he tried his hand on the wrong corner and got dropped  but you were worried about brandon right  look in my game  you take some kid you play it the safest way you can  but it aint about no hiding forever  you heard  frankly you been in it as long as me  you do the thing on your name  anyone going to come after omar they know omars coming after him  oh indeed  so who came after brandon  i heard it might have been weebey  his boy stinkum  and bird  he was down with the snatch too  so what can you give us on the job  you had an incoming call  to dangelo barksdales giving him the number of a pay phone  westside exchange numbers encoded right  three minutes later we get another call from the lowrises to that number  then a halfminute later you get another call from the lowrises  to a pager we know is stringer bells  ill be damned  finally you get another call  probably from a pay phone probably stringer bell calling back  coming on into the lowrise courts  fortyfive minutes later another call  this one from the same pay phone that went to dangelos pager  to start the whole thing off you see that  this is the murder right here  this first number the one they sent to dangelo  im thinking this comes from a pay phone over by the greeks  hes on you  were up on those pay phones tuesday night  we catch that murder we get there before the murder  its all here on the pen register  this one calling that one that one calling back  were up on those pay phones when we should be and we have him cold  but were not up in time are we  in this case were never where we need to be  bad time for you all  he fight but you arrest  you saw him get arrested  on tuesday tuesday yes tuesday  by the police the police arrested him  cops they handcuffed him  what about these guys  were they there with him  no  he fight you arrest right  okay thank you sir thank you  its a match  no  i need help rawls ranks me  lieutenant think what youre doing here  youre going to cross bill rawls  as ruthless a fuck as we have in this department  and to do what  to fight for a case the deputy of operations doesnt even want  no  i like my career thank you very much  in the cemetery you were telling us that a guy named bird killed the working man  yeah the man who testified  william gant right  yeah bird did that one for sure  how do you know everybody knows man  nigger walked up behind the man and shot him in the head  the whole blessed project saw that much  and bird worked for avon  yeah as one of his shooters  liked to use this real sweet gun he got  a 380 from austria or australia something like that  but i know he loved that gun  a 380  yeah a 380 you get him you get the gun  cause birds too dumb to throw a gun like that off  a gun alone aint enough oh no  he testifies he bought the gun on the street after gant was killed  what would be enough then eyeball witness  some kind of corroboration for what youre telling me here  okay okay what  im your man you saw the murder  yeah  you can id this man bird as the shooter of william gant  and you aint afraid to go into court  and testify against one of barksdales people  omar dont scare  the fact is that while lt daniels and his merry band are lost in the swamps  playing with beepers and pay phones and body mikes  my people have developed information that ties barksdale to three killings  dangelo barksdale not avon dangelo on behalf of avon  the victim is identified by our witnesses as being involved with avon barksdale  sir were developing  youre dancing around this thing  im charging three murders  you charge those cases my investigation folds  not one of those cases is strong enough for court you know that  so we bring the barksdale kid in  throw a little mindfuck at him and the case becomes stronger  youve had him in the box twice before hes gonna go for less the third time  so we recanvass develop fresh witnesses  the case i charge on today can be twice as strong by the trial date  we get a conviction  we roll little boy barksdale into big boy barksdale  then we go home  iike good oldfashioned cops and pound some budweiser  this is bullshit  it was mcnulty who made the ballistics match on these murders  and hes telling me to fight this  he knows you dont have a viable prosecution  so do you so do l  enough  look ive got no love for your wiretap lieutenant  im spending 2000 a day  over the unit operating budget to staff the case  over the unit operating budget to staff the case  now major rawls here is offering a chance  to leverage barksdale through a murder prosecution  why not jump on this  because if major rawls is right  then he will be just as right a month from now  if the wire doesnt give us a case he can charge all the murders he has  we lose nothing  but if hes wrong  if he cant convict or if the barksdale kid doesnt flip  then its too late to do anything else  avon barksdale changes up his pattern and the wiretap dies  at that point there isnt going to be a thing  that you or me or rawls here is gonna be able to say to that judge  you wanted to see me major  mcnulty does personal business on the clock i want to know  he cheats on a run sheet i want to know  he runs any kind of game at all i want to know  major the mans an asshole  but he doesnt do much other than work hes got this case in his gut like its cancer  he does no wrong  doesnt drink anymore  doesnt drink on duty doesnt drink and drive detective  major youve got to help me on this michael  the murder warrants on hold  the deputy gave us another month  also whoever that was you brought in here today  gave himself up as an eyewitness to the gant murder  who omar  greggs said to tell you shed write it up in the morning  lieutenant  thanks  it cost you
