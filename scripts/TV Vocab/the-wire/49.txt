                oh man  whats next  one to the head  keep it quick  not yet motherfucker  you shoot live rounds like paint  boy you be the shit you hear  yo but these really do look like glocks  yeah they make them look that way  yo why you shoot low  all right  if youre close aim for the head  if not think vest  thats the way you said it  aight  boys learnin   you going inside this one too  im gonna do the whole block  its bad enough you popped the top off of one house and give us a body  what the fuck do you think youre doing now  an experiment  an experiment  fuck me  im dealing with madam curie here  this nail here comes from a nail gun  and it comes from the house with a dead man inside  every other house has screws that hcd uses  we find these in the plywood anywhere in this city  and theres a body inside  gosh thats good work  no im very impressed  do you see a tool belt on me  do i look like one of those fuckin jerkoffs  in aisle 5 of the home fuckin depot  theres 3 weeks left in the year  and our unit clearance rate is under 50  we do not go looking for bodies  especially moldering fucking john does  we do not put red up on the board voluntarily  jay the bodies are in the houses  marlo stanfields bodies  then they belong to him  now i realize youre no longer in my squad  mr major crimes  but youre still part of cid right  and look im still a sergeant right  and im giving you an order on this lester  until i feel chainofcommand down on this  and until you hear otherwise you will not  i repeat not pull down any more  fucking wood  let it go man  i mean you know i expect a shortfall  when i look at the school budget its a natural  but how in christs name do you lose 54 million  one million at a time  exactly it didnt happen this morning  this was on royces watch  you didnt get a whiff of this during council review  you cant blame the council or royce for the school budget  the fiscal responsibility is with the school board itself  but the council does have oversight  dont even pretend to put this shit on me  only the city share shows up on our budget review  we never see the state money  you better tell your pretty new chief of staff  that whatever happens up on north avenue  is on the school system  thats a simplistic view i think  how would you complicate it  as president of the school board ill argue this is a bookkeeping issue  weve simply been rolling the systems debt over since 99  you rolled it and rolled it until it ran out of cash  thats not bookkeeping thats stupidity  so what are we talking about here waste  fraud embezzlement  i would say that although the system has  some poor accounting practices  in the end were going to find that most of the money  was properly spent on programming  ok ok we get it  no ones responsible not the school board  not anybody on north avenue not clarence royce  not the city council no one at this table  fine so whats our next move  bump the property tax rate  scale back our budget  no pay hikes hiring freezes reduced services  tell everyone schools police fire public works  they have to hold the line for a year or 2  how  i just ran a clean up the streets campaign  i just got done promising the world to every cop in the city  annapolis  you go beg his republican ass  the cheese stands alone  this the drop  i hope not cause they aint called yet  make me feel bad

call  about an hour so far by my watch  got me out here riding the wood  unfortunately the governors phone call  has gone longer than anticipated  can i get you anything coffee  look i have other appointments  it shouldnt be much longer  check out fishers column in metro  he says the governor thinks quote  this latest fiscal emergency calls into question  the baltimore school systems ability to manage itself  as well as the local oversight of the system  unquote  motherfucker  hes playing to the dc suburbs  he sees you coming for him  he aint no fool  theres all your electronic requisitions right there  what ones that a cop  nah security guard  i dont think hes one of marlos though  lieutenant  will someone explain to me what the fuck the brass is doing  first i get bounced to telephone reporting  then i get a call this morning  hows that beach house coming huh  its almost done   i just need a load of lumber  thats great just great  welcome welcome back  who the fuck is that  that sergeant hauk  is one of the most effective supervisors in our police department  sorry  its just taking a little longer than we expected  it shouldnt be much longer though  i understand what youre saying  some of those kids are ready for high school  but not duquan   ive  adopted him  ive noticed duquan this semester  hes more nourished wears fresher clothes  sometimes he even smells like soap  you and your wife  you dont have children do you   not yet no  well have some  for better or for worse theyre yours for life  the kids in this school arent yours  you do your piece with them and you let them go  because therell be plenty more coming up behind duquan  and theyre gonna need your help too  youve got your third period in 5 minutes right  settle down settle down  we need to concentrate on these tests  ah fuck this man  talking bout if janes father  gives jane 1 weeks worth of allowance  shit i aint got no allowance where i stay at father neither  how many sides a sexagon got  why i care about that  you need to take the test so you can move on to the next level  i aint moving nowhere but out this motherfucker  all right all right lets settle down  lets start with question number 1  settle down  all right all right listen up  heres the problem    they get the check  yo when they say couples   do it mean they married  why they got to be married  mr prezbo why you even get married  well to build a life together for one  you know family  also to have intimacy   what do that mean  he mean like getting some  no no its not just that  intimacy can be um a quiet conversation  or it can fun you know  like when you tickle your partner  yo tickle my nuts  all right all right no more of that  come on lets get to the test material  the statewide exam is next week  and then well get back to the regular lessons  can we talk about intimacy  if you like and if i dont get too embarrassed  all right uh so the grand total on the check  is 6740 but if they want to leave a tip  look at your sample test please  i got to say miss duquette it felt like yall schemed us  this class is the same as the ones down the hall  yeah its cause the test coming up  ok class lets take a look at the sample math test   in sample a we start with  kids right this is bullshit  the test material doesnt exactly speak to their world  yeah dont speak too loud to mine either  an estimate detective  we start opening those houses  we might turn over a couple of dozen bodies  but thats just me guessing  all of them homicides  the boy took over half the west side  we never saw the violence  this right here is the reason why  youre asking us to call out half of public works  and pull the plywood off thousands of vacant houses  all so we can raise the citys murder rate by 10  what else are we doing on stanfield  im trying to get backup on his peoples cellphones as fast as i can  and i started to look for his money  but if im right about this they have to be worked  is there any evidence at all  that links all these missing persons reports  to the stanfield organization  im just starting at that  the one body that we pulled out of the fulton avenue house is lex  his case is a direct tie  and there are 2 other names on those missing persons reports  that show up in our wire taps from earlier this year  so yes there are links counselor  by any chance did landsman run this up the chain to you guys  no  your call  my office wont care until they see case files  ill run it upstairs  and well see what comes  ok i get it  hes still tied up  but it really should only be a little while longer  can you tell the governor i have to go back to baltimore  i have a little bit of business today  im the mayor of a major american city for christs sakes  how much shit do i have to eat from this guy  wouldnt you play the politics if you were him  its not like the state had no role in this thing  the state money for those schools had no oversight either  but im not telling the washington fucking post  talking about how he might be forced  to bail me out because what was the quote again  because those are my children in baltimore too  hes gonna bleed me for that money  mayor carcetti  the governors office says hes ready to see you now  54 millions a big number  we wont go until we get some  we wont go until we get some  did i do something wrong  i aint acted up or nothing  youre ready for this  you can do the work  i know you can  and if you need to come back here  and use the showers or give me laundry  use the computer you can do that any time  anyway let me show you  this here the way to the hard drive  this isnt necessary duquan  just in case im busy mr p  so you know how to work it   hey boy  whats up  big day for you see here  i got the inventory divided between us  you gonna go up one way towards north avenue  and im gonna stay down by the highway  you gonna let me handle the money alone  you ready aint you  yeah im good  all right

him somewhere else  thats messed up man  all right holla man  how many  as a theory  detective freamon believes there could be  additional bodies in those vacants maybe a dozen or more  he believes  lester freamon is not in the habit of selling woof tickets  i for one would not bet against him  and what do you suggest i do with this information  my feeling is  that city hall should be brought into the loop  we pull the bodies now before new years  and the stats go to royces last year in office  matter of fact it gives carcetti an advantage  with regards to next years crime rate   you mean  tell the major  that now is the time to empty those houses  not next year when its on his watch and he has to eat the stats  colonel i see youve thought this through  politically i mean  im learning as i go  i bet you fuckin are  colonel keep this conversation close  thats a direct order  you seen those girls at douglass man  yo you right duke  aint gonna be like middle school no more  you know

boys ourselves  get all paul bunyan and shit you know  i mean well be all discreet and all  not take the hacksaw to no more than a couple  on some quiet streets leave more than enough  for some people to have light and all  thing is i got this other thing  i still need to take care of today  come on sherrod wake up  its late  no no no what you do what you do  what you do  come on sherrod  come on man come on come on  you werent supposed to do this man  oh man  no phones  not a one  and the players that were using them before  chris monk rayray  they were out there on those corners  now i would have seen if someone went to a burner  goddamn it  if we just stayed up on the wire 2 months ago  we wouldnt be going through this  can i help you  which one of you is sergeant hauk  i am  im shea this is thomas iid  let me ask if you remember  pulling a surveillance camera from isd  serial number aw466j9 you remember that  we also need to go over your paperwork on a couple of informants  so if you dont mind coming back downtown with us  you and  detective sydnor and  the third guy whats his name dozerman  you dont need sydnor or doze either  paperworks all mine on the camera  on the informants me alone  bodies   how many  could be quite a few  we wont know until we take down those doors  and this is 1 drug organization you think did this  thats the theory but nothings certain at this point  what is certain is that if were going to do this  you probably want us to do it now before the new year  while the bump in the murder rate is still attributable to mayor royce  thoughtful deputy very thoughtful  i dont want anymore stat games from your department  you need to get your people into those houses  because if there are bodies in there they need to come out  but do it now  i dont want to be finding anymore bodies come january  yes sir mr mayor sir  choice comes down to this we take the state money  and instead of being fucked up and broke  our schools go back to being merely fucked up  no teacher layoffs  no program cuts no school closures  but the price the governors asking is more state control over the school board  and changes in the teachers union contracts  that would allow them to remove tenured faculty for cause  we dont take the money looks like were shorting our own kids  if we take the money were giving up  local control of education which is gonna lose us  a lot of middle class black folks  not to mention the problem you might have  running in the dc suburbs  explaining how you needed their money to bail out your schools  he sees you coming tommy  thats not important right now  take the money we need it  dont look at me if you take it  youre selling out the teachers and thats my base  if you dont take it youre selling out the kids  either way ill probably rip you and half the council will too  just glad im not the mayor  you called  word down the chain open em up  and its my guess this case is gonna need more manpower  yeah no doubt  in fact i might have lost herc to an iid file  really i went light on him for that car stop  i didnt even think it would get to a trial board  this feels like a bigger jacket  pick any 2 you want from cid for now  if you get back up on a wire well detail a few more  beautiful  i dont know what youre talking about but she was hot  im going back on friday right after work  hold on  what the
