you mean what do you say  how honest should i be  i mean its one thing to talk technical shit or enforcement strategies  but the shit that actually goes on  i start talking about that i dont know if i can stop  cedric this is your chance  this is a career  and what if i take my shots at burrell and rawls  and he decides not to clean house what then  the new mayor calls you up  asks you for your take on things  and you dont want to be what a politic  carcetti oh  i dont even know the man  if he is calling you  its because guys like burrell and rawls are on the ropes  maybe  i know there is a risk  but maybe id fire away  both barrels  oh wait out here man  up top  oh wait oh wait  you got that grub you got that pot  oh wait  shake it and jiggle it yo  who made that track  yo who you

it was only a drug charge  you swore he wasnt coming back  this is a good thing michael  its going to be back the way it was  the way it was  we family again  you lied to me  people change michael  he say you can give him back the independence card too  he gonna take care of all that for us  thanks for coming up from washington  the party is happy for the opportunity  you got some heat behind you at this point  but down to business  the way we see it  we got to cobble together a citywide turnaround  call it the baltimore miracle or some shit  which starts with a  since that was your campaign cry  you want the double digits  no doubt  dennys got to do a bricks and mortar project downtown  put his name on something  well we flushed with stadiums  got hotels out of the ass  you guys got a good convention center  and a convention center expansion  gotta put something up get the sign on it that says  brought to you by tommy carcetti and the citizens of baltimore  well think on it  but you dont have too much time to decide   anything else  education always polls good  oh no we got to stay away from schools  our last 4 administrations  left us with an inner city system with inner city problems  we get involved start talking shit  it becomes our mess  gotta respect the depths  one you get the drop in crime  two you build something downtown  and 3 you stay away from schools  and

this animated in a classroom  focused the corner culture kids at least  the ones with deeper problems they opted out of that  deeper problems  were not just up against corner logic in there  i am seeing oppositional defiant disorders  clinical depression post traumatic stress  and with the girl shaundra  borderline psychoses maybe  and with those type of problems  we are gonna have a social worker here fulltime  but the corner kids yeah they really came alive  when they talk about what they know  they talk from here and they stay on point  shit they have been even taking turns in there  question is can we get them in that kind of mindset on stuff they dont know  can we have them earn on faith alone  in all honesty this is uncharted territory  where do you go from here  how about we
