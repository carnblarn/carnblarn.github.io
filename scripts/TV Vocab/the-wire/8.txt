motherfucking thing i need is for the clean name on my liquor license  to be dirtied the fuck up by you you understand that  avon come on man  do your fucking job  i checked with the state personnel

telling him  hes the deputy for operations i arrested an aide to a state senator  how do i not tell him  have you noticed there hasnt been a complaint from the senator  know why  what is his driver doing coming out of the highrises with so much money  i told the deputy that what did he say  mind our own business  give the man back his money and go the fuck away  pretty much  except he said a few things for my benefit too  like how i had shit all over him  like how he was shutting us down this week  the fuck he is were done  i go past friday and im buried he told me that  hes gonna bury you for what youre doing your fucking job  you think the job is gonna save me you think its gonna save you  chainofcommand thats all i got from the deputy today  chainofcommand  did you tell your major about the senators driver or the colonel  no then wheres your chainofcommand  whats the shift lieutenant doing going up the back stairs to the deputy ops  what are you saying nothing  goddamn right  why he got something on you  you say you got the deputys ear what the fucks he got on you  only rank detective  yo stink what about the rules yo  special occasion yo  yo bey  im gonna throw up no you aint  burrell thinks i crossed him  he said this to you  in so many words  you need to explain then explain what  that im bringing in a case that goes everywhere  today it was some senators driver  two days from now a city councilman maybe  he asked for a charge on barksdale thats all he asked for  this thing with the legislative aide who couldve foreseen it  he saw it burrell  see this is the thing that everyone knows and no one says  you follow the drugs you get a drug case  you start following the money you dont know where youre going  thats why they dont want wiretaps or wired cls or anything they cant control  because once that tape starts rolling who the hell knows whats going to be said  that son of a bitch mcnulty asked me what the deputy had on me  he actually asked me that  what did you say  where everybody go where the girls go  fuck it man party broke  we drunked out and fucked out  you all send me out for liquor and by the time i get back the shit is dead  look at this  the knicks done fucked up their draft again  whats with her  oh fucked her silly what can i say  she snorted half the shit we brought up in here too that greedy bitch  yo bey  you wanted to see us what the hell is this  i got copied this morning  its just what it looks like  a memo signed by the deputy ops rawls and forester telling us to pack it in  we come down on the wire by friday ship the computers to the dea by monday  and charge whoever we have by the end of next week  yeah who do you have  couple of midlevel guys anton artis aka stinkum  shooter named bird wanted for killing gant  he was the witness in your court  thats it except for a couple of hangerson yeah  why are they doing this why now  we picked up a bag man coming out of the highrises  carrying 20000 in cash yesterday  so so he works for clay davis  of the 39th legislative district  the deputy was displeased  its okay though  we gave the money back said we were sorry  what can daniels do not a fucking thing  the deputy sent him the same direct order you have on your desk right there  get me burrell on the line  detectives when you swore that your affidavit was true  to the best of your ability what did the circuit court of baltimore do  you gave us the wire for how long detective mcnulty  sixty days no  and how long have you monitored these phone extensions  forty days maybe  deputy burrell is on the line  erv its phelan  kiddo youre fucking with me here  yes you are  erv listen to me  the circuit court signed two orders  for a total of 60 days of telephonic surveillance  now im looking at a copy of a memo from your office  telling me i cant have my 60 days  youre not hearing me  the circuit court for baltimore ordered 60 days on this tap  the court wants its 60 days  now if you take this wire down on friday youll be in contempt of court on monday  understood  and all the best to arlene and the kids  yeah  whos your daddy now  look i didnt do a damn thing lieutenant you got a beef its with the judge  yeah he got the deputys memo he called his own shot  ask greggs if you dont believe me  look ive got to go  kima  deputy called mad as the devil  tell them to quit packing were back up on the wire  kima  mcnulty or the judge or both  this time the judge  ask me a question any question  i thought you werent studying  this job is common sense ask me a question dickless  see how i do  according to q1  hold up help me out here you have to know them by the numbers  it helps  makes it sound more professional that way  according to q1   the general order covering sexual harassment  in the event a female officer in your squad complains  that her side partner has sexually harassed her  you should  a notify the commanding officer  b notify the shift lieutenant  c notify the ranking female officer  i go with d  d  yeah bitchslap the side partner for dipping into my private stock  then take missy home and fuck her till she smiles  what the hell  when a small change in price creates a large change in demand  then demand is said to be elastic but some products are inelastic  meaning a change in price does not affect demand  some key factors that affect the elasticity of demand are what  mr bell desire  consumer need  right specifically the ability of a consumer to delay acquisition what else  my pencil lost its point  all the girls say so  damon we got work orders here and aint nothing happening  these jobs were due yesterday and people going to be coming in here  asking for their work and nothing been done  man fuck them let them wait  no you are not going to bring that corner bullshit up in here you hear me  you know what we got here  we got an elastic product you know what that mean  that mean when people can go elsewhere and get their printing and copying done  they gonna do it  you acting like we got an inelastic product and we dont  now i want this to run like a true fucking business  not no front not no bullshit  understand me  im serious  where you snatch this old wreck from out frederick road  ditch it over eastside when we done  check it him there and that other fool there  they the only ones might be trouble  ill drop scar you just drop that other motherfucker  no just scar his boy break we going to let him  but if he raise up im on him see damn i wish bird was here man  bird be loving this shit right here  which do remind me we get up out of here  you need to drop that shit down a storm drain  now give me some time to go around the block  and set up on the other side all right  what up who got black tops  hey now  what the fuck  listen here bey  you come at the king you best not miss  stinks been got stink  bey caught one too in the leg shit man what happened  they down the gulley on edmondson fucking scar man  no it aint him omar man omar  bountys going up on that bitch  that fucks us  we had stinkum tied up with a bow from the arrest of the runner  and now hes out of the case  the mans a fucking loose cannon  literally weve got to pull his ass up at least  theres a dime on this cocksuckers head  one of you motherfuckers needs to step up  where you go with that maryland general  walked up in there and told them i was on the corner caught a stray  police come talk to you just a roller no homicide  put it out there not just our people either  im talking about any nigger who wants to step up  put out the word  theres 10000 on omar or any motherfucker standing with omar  yall niggers aint got shit to do but be on this motherfuckin hunt  now be on it all right  so what you think homes  im thinking this is the worst part of the game  best we do is break out even right what  im saying this shit got personal aint nothing else to it  so you talking about letting it slide for a time maybe  im saying we put the word out that you ready to talk a truce  when this nigger come out from underneath his rock you hit him  but right now this shit got out of hand  what you want me to say  look i dont know nothing about stink getting dropped  and i dont know nothing about bey getting shot either  i dont know about this crazy nonsense i dont know it came back to us quick  you know how that be  everybody want to believe the worst about omar  but live and let live you know  i dont see you letting them slide on brandon  if i was coming after certain people  i definitely wouldnt want to give yall fine people any cause for concern  there are rules here right  rules yeah  no mistakes no bystanders  no taxpayers getting caught up in the mix  i mean you just get in close and you hit the right nigger  and lose the gun afterward thatd be a rule too i think  one thing omar  having stinkum dropped kind of fucks us on our thing  how so  we had stink caught with 4 gpacks on a reup  and maybe we couldve built something on that  roll him up with stringer maybe now hes got no roll to him  so the point is omar while were all grateful  for the case you gave us on bird and we admire your doityourself nature  we need you to hang back  look man it aint all up to me right  i got a bounty on my head  yeah we saw the van  look man i do what i can do to help you all but the game is out there  and its

 im interviewing omar a few weeks back  and hes giving it to me that bird is the shooter in the gant case  he tells me if we catch up to bird hell have the gun on him  which he does  but the thing is i told him that we needed an eyeball witness  at which point he volunteers  maybe he saw it  or maybe he put himself in it just to see bird locked up  i got the impression there wasnt much love between them  i fucked up didnt l  a little but the gun matches  and hes consistent with our witness on the description and the scenario  so dont sweat it  kima  you know interrogation is more art than science  youve got to feel your way through on instinct mostly  come take a look at this  who are they  some dancers who work at barksdales club  i pulled their names off of liquor board
