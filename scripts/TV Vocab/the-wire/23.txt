when we spooked them  sobotkas cellphone too we might be going up on a dead line  this is the other way to go  compared to the wiretap its the longer way around  but still if hes changing up on his cellphone  over the last week or so  weve not only confirmed the identities of some of the key players  weve also got gps trackers on all their cars  first of all  eton beneleazer hes the drug lieutenant in the warehouse   eton  whatever  our madam miss ilona petrovna  george glekas who runs the appliance store over in highlandtown  and the probable fence for the organization we followed some of them in real time  with this little toy here theres something else we can do  thats seven days of where our targets have been sped up  and lookit two locations only  where three or four cars stopped at the same time for more than five minutes  one x is a dive of a diner down on south clinton  the other is on the western shore of fort howard down past edgemere  we get up on these locations maybe we get a photo of the boss man   or a tag number  its totally cool   where did you even get this stuff  dea for the trackers  mcnulty pulled the software from his pals at the fbi field office  we can pull herc and carver off the warehouse and give them the diner  mcnulty bunk you guys take fort howard  what the fuck frank  you might as well start posting them things right  i mean shit if youre gonna run you might as well come out and say so  it aint personal ott  i want to finish what i started with the dredging issue  and you dont think im good enough to handle it  it aint about that kiddo  ott listen to me  what the fuck do you want me to do tell him where the money comes from  ibs  not to brag but union racketeering is one thing the bureau does well  that is exactly what i wanted to hear this case needs closure boys  and in my heart of hearts  i know youre the kind of bastards to put sobotka where he needs to be  one other thing you federals can help me with  and if you dont mind a little discretion is called for  that right there is the district surveillance van  which was fully equipped when it disappeared  a surveillance van  sobotka stole it now its idontknowwhere  the last picture was from seattle  but i got prints  from two other places see  you reported the van stolen right  it was my feeling that the theft of a vehicle from a departmental lot  would reflect poorly on the department  the thing is i know you boys have got enough reach  to maybe get the van back without no big dustup  as a favor for me having brought you the whole case  motherfucking eastside need to get their asses  back across town where they belong  yo man we run them off we run off the good dope so  im just saying they all the time hustling around  cutting prices

wingtips  and the beady eyes definite giveaway   tight asses  definitely  lt daniels agents settles and mason  maj valchek said youd be expecting us  you listening to this fool  saying that the eastside is wilder than westside  cause of some shit about eastside folks drinking port wine  while the westside do sherry  port make a man do crazy shit im telling you   butchie talk to this fool  for me leastways  the difference between east and west goes back to one man   frank matthews  pee wee matthews  yeah the brother went up new york and got in bed with them italians  the only one from

courthouse not mine  but i want one thing on record  as of 911 the bureau has one priority in this case  its waterfront corruption  its a new world and the ports are vulnerable  this case is bigger

where does the call go to   why are you asking  the boss man at fort howard  he tosses the cellphone were up on right  then he pulls out another thingamajig and he types a message  text messaging  it starts at one of those towers they got up all over the place right  and ends up in a computer at a wireless provider  if you knew when the call was made could you trace the call back to that tower  cause if you could mightnt you get a phone number  you get that then you got the billing details right  fool do you have any idea how many people use cellphones  there must be thousands hundreds of thousands at any time  what you need is another variable  another bit of data thats gonna help you isolate your call from all the others  what if you knew where the call was made i mean exactly where it was made  we were out in the middle of nowhere does that help narrow it down  the fort howard sea wall it aint exactly charles and baltimore streets  youve got another problem which wireless
