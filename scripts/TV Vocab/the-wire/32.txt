steady  but shootings and agg assaults are both down  drug arrests too but i guess that wont look so good  i mean where geographically are we down  in the district  well the posts near the designated drug zones are up  almost all of them  that aint pretty but everywhere else is down  in some places as much as four percent  bosses are gonna love you  its too soon to take any credit  this might be

pulaski hollins and payson  theyre empty  all of them  districtwide my crime is down five percent  but do the bosses know  no the bosses dont know shit about it  this is just a district commander taking an initiative on his own  jesus christ  i knew it was only a matter of time before i bumped into  somebody from downtown about this  and i know your natural impulse is to take what you saw  back downtown with you but i gotta ask you  you legalized drugs  look this is a tactical deployment  we just wait for everything to get settled down here  in these three zones and then we move  look we make a big show of lockin everybody up  and then we shut it down  im sorry i had to fuck you up on that arrest  and im sorry you had to see us give that runt back the gpack  that was ugly i know  but im just tryin to save whats left of my district  anyway i can if i can  and the longer i have before i have to brief the bosses  about this deployment  we got all we needed from the car stop major  dont sweat it  let me get a word with my old commander  i dunno major  whenever you bust this place up theyll go back to their same corners  besides you were never much on making a big show  if this doesnt work jimmy were back to the usual  and im out the door on a pension anyway  but jimmy i need more time  i need to be able to rely on you and your people to keep this close  the bosses dont know huh  fuck the bosses  you the man who called  i did  you witnessin or what  im afraid im blind  legally  something you need to see though  glock 40 i believe  i suppose you aint going to tell me who

but we have put it on the agenda for the next meeting  of the coordinating council on criminal justice  youre sentencing it to committee  mr mayor were probably only talking like a few hundred thousand to start  im not saying we should create new identities for these people  and send em to new mexico like the feds  we just need to get them out of harms way  lemme tell you something councilman  i cant lay my hands on several hundred thousand dollars  that is not already spoken for   mr mayor i was not  what would you have me do councilman  should i divert the money thats already been budgeted  for snow removal from the first district this winter  how bout i reduce trash pickup to once a week citywide  put the witnesses up at the hyatt inner harbor  im not trying to be difficult tommy come on  the city in the financial situation its in  very few friends in annapolis  weve done all we can do with this matter for now  okay then  thanks for your time  gentlemen  nah

protestant whiskey  the price is right aint it  make it neat  excuse me  hey  hey  what are you doing here  i was just asking myself the same thing  you drive all the way down here to look at me  from across the room and then leave thats kinda creepy  you looked occupied  him honey thats just business  this aint my kind of crowd  definitely not  yeah well i made a mistake so im gonna go  fourtwentyeight  you live in this town  why book the room  i live across town  as late as these things go thats a dui away  give me two hours mcnulty  what am i gonna do for two hours  dream on it  waters fresh  you keepin them cool  you got squeakers nestin squabs  takin care of the younguns i like seein that  yeah marlo hes real loyal  you cant kick him off that nest  good work  thats really good work  police comin off them corners  i seen  im gonna keep my name off the package for a time  keep wholesalin  you know step back a bit  barksdale gonna think we weak  not comin out to claim whats ours  the police leave them corners hes gonna be back out there  i know he will  your turn girl  its a bout time  for real  for starters  its memory holds the last 10 calls made and received by the user  thats enough to give us a signature  signature  the phone numbers unique to an individual  that way we can identify the user when he switches to another phone  sorry im late woke up in the wrong town  anyway we ran the tolls on those numbers  and we came up with a rather interesting pattern  check this out  this is the pattern of a clod communication network  something you would expect from a drug organization  this particular one so far involves 15 distinct burners   and none of them list subscriber information  you can do that  with these burners with this particular company  you dont need subscriber information  our data shows that over 92 of the calls are made within this network  with the average call lasting less than a minute  again suggestive of drug trafficking  this user here he serves as a clearing house  he receives calls and initiates interactions  he coordinates the show  be nice if that was stringer  now this is the best part this is something that prez discovered  when he was playing with it  it has a speed dial feature  meaning someone took the time to program the phone  hell thats probably the only way these corner boys  can remember all the numbers  what with these phones being dumped every few days or so  ill bet all the other phones in the network are set up the same way  well ive heard enough  we should start writing for the wire  when can we get up  get up on what  theyre dumping phones every couple weeks on average  by the time you get a wire up on that the phones are dead  the whole network shuts down simultaneously  do we have a plan  not yet we dont  but for now if i could get a couple more of these dead phones  itll probably help corroborate the theory for the affidavit  kima maybe you could ask those western boys to pick up  what they find on the ground for the next few days  yeah sure  damn boy you smell like sex  you didnt take a fucking shower  late for work  you forgot my newports didnt you  aw shit man i did yo  lemme do up these chips an then ill go get your cigs  fuck  three one shooting at the number one mayo   were gonna need some suits down here   for investigation im on my way   roger 10 hundred   back so soon  i thought you guys had enough of our happy district yesterday  just need a favor  lester wants you to scoop up any discarded cell phones  you find on barksdale corners  you want barksdale license plates   tag numbers and all  whatever sure  cause i saw the big man riding in a truck the other day  missed the tag but if i see him again  stringer   naw the other guy  what other guy  big boy the one we locked up   avon  avon barksdale  jesus herc hes at jessup down for four or five at least  what we all look alike to you  if you dont believe me fuck it  no fuckin way  but the fact remains  we would not be returning this service weapon to this officer  without help from the citizens of baltimore as well  and on that note i think our mayor would like to say a few words  thank you commissioner burrell  i just want to take this opportunity to commend our department  on successfully resolving this case  and to wish officer dozerman a speedy return to duty  officer dozerman  the citizens want you to have this back  and to thank you for your service in defense of our city   and i especially want to thank all of our concerned residents  who called into the hotline we would not be here today   lester  lieutenant you gotta see this  big joke  soustitres par la wired team
