you know  they dont know shit  damn   you my ride  im your motherfucking savior is what i am  told yall andre was lying on me yo  i didnt do it for you  fact is  if i could work back on whatever cases i already caught  you might be going right back inside  i know  so who did kill that delivery girl  i dont know  know it wasnt andre  his blood dont run that kind of cold  who he getting his package from  saying i could go back to the crib and bear up  find some things for you if you want me to   you owe me motherfucker  im saying i know i do man  if you want to pay down this debt  you know what you gotta do for me  no more bodies  no more fucking bodies from you  no more comebacks or getevens on this  no more killing  you owe me your word  all right man  no bodies on me  really want to ease my mind  youll let me drive you down to aberdeen rail station  put you on a northbound train  naw man  baltimores all i know  you know what it is like homey  man gotta live what he know right  youre absolutely right there are many significant factors to consider  but getting crime under control is key to sparking investment here   jumpstarting growth  if you make it safe they will come  i hate to begin our beautiful relationship with my hand out  but im told that two federal grants to my office dry up this year  thats right come the first of the year  those doj grants evaporate and youre out 12 prosecutors  i was hoping youd be able to absorb that in the general fund  maybe even throw in a little bit more  make it competitive with the pd and attorney generals jobs  starts the turnover its killing us  this would be the time to do it  i mean were over the revenue  expected for this point in the fiscal year  next to the real estate market  how much past cause i want to come out of the box  with a big bump in police salaries in particular the commissioners salary  which needs to jump like 50 grand  a good guess would be a oneshot surplus of about 20 million  but thats rainyday money for more than crime  around north avenue the schools are running a deficit  excuse me did you say a 50000 bump for ervin burrell  well no not for burrell per se  for the next police commissioner then   thats what you mean  looking ahead makes sense  because firing him would upset a goodsize block  of my constituency not to mention the ministers  and the budget chair might have a difficult time  allowing a higher salary to be approved  in fact i can guarantee if that proposals in the budget  your first for the record  the bill wont come out of committee intact  im just saying that in the event commissioner burrell were to leave  wed want to bump that salary in order to attract the best candidates  in particular the best africanamerican candidates from across the nation  with 3 years left in his term why would he leave  councilman what may not have been obvious to you  on the public safety subcommittee  is that the budget process is a carefullyorchestrated ballet  a cooperative effort between the branches of government  well madam president  the nuances of that cooperative effort are beginning to come into focus for me  thank you madam president  come on in everyone  dont wait by the door  duquan youre here  randy youre here  no you two switch  calvin youre here in the front  quenice youre here  mike youre here  destiny here  myesha here  dashonda here  come on keep moving dont stop at the door come in  lets get started  mike could be a problem  how so  your boy been assigned to what they called a major crimes unit  meaning what  they the motherfuckers that did the last 3 city wiretaps  one where they bugged barksdales office  another where they hit kentel up in park heights  and the last one shit  they was all up on stringer bells cellphone  you aint still using burners is you  im dumping them every two weeks  not good enough  you read that  youll see the stringer was changing his number every damn day  and they still pulled the motherfuckers voice  off a goddamn cellphone tower  city police did that  whered you get this  courthouse clerks office  hey the shits open to the public after they finish prosecuting your ass  you need to lose them cellphones son  me i aint as so much as touched a burner in a year   you got it  now hold the measure and spread your arms out to the side  what you got  i want one  so your cat can eat em  oh howd you find them  i went to the calculators  give me that give it here  the same  your height and your arm span identical  quenice  see look you about to get me in trouble  so you say you like to box right  you must have some kind of reach  everything cheap on computers if you know where to look for it  yo this mean the price im getting from the koreans  yo they still marking it up some  they gotta be  i can make twice as much using this here  cant  all this along the lower patapsco westport area  is ready for a turn  the proximity to downtown and the bw parkway  make it ideal for washington commuters thats a given  anything to speed it up  a harbor promenade could work  going west from both sides of the bridge  the south harbor promenade brought to you by  mayor thomas carcetti  and the citizens of baltimore  doesnt quite have the same ring  as a stadium or an aquarium expansion does it   its a start  further east  youve got the locust point marine terminal  which unfortunately is still a working enterprise  and the further you go into brooklyn curtis bay  the more the skyline disappears  we lose the washington crowd  for that waterfront youre gonna need a different draw   casinos  oh the urban planning default  i dont want the kind of crime that comes with casinos  tax base is tax base  this is where i get off the boat  its one thing to sell waterfront for tax base  but now youre just sucking paychecks out of my community  well it was just a thought  and anyway were getting ahead of ourselves  this is just the first long meeting of many  so thanks to everyone  and well continue this later  madam president a word with you  do you have a minute  you and me got a problem already  just trying to help guide you through the process  mr mayorelect  felt more like you were dragging me across a minefield narice   why you so pissed off at me  look  clarence shouldnt have run again for any number of reasons  i was ready to step up  and the deal was cut long ago that hed back me when the time came  you and tony you guys jumped the line  it wasnt your turn  first of all im sorry if tony and i ruined your party plans  but i wasnt privy to whatever you and clarence cooked up  that aside i was  kind of looking forward to working closely together  i think that we could make things happen  youre only getting the one term tommy  im not gonna stand down next time  what makes you think ill even be around that long  governors race is in two years  and plans can change  you find yourself mayor in 2008 without so much as a campaign speech  wasnt

put eyes on this motherfucker  i can try  so narice is bucking already  feels like if the mayors chair  aint gonna go to royce it should be hers  problem is shes gonna see any proposal  to raise the commissioners salary as a move against burrell  which it is  we cant raise the salary we cant attract strong minority candidates  no strong candidates we cant get rid of the guy we got  fuck if im gonna live with burrell as my commissioner  what if he quits   quits  maybe the man can be shamed  if he leaves on his own account  that takes us off the hook with narice and the ministers  right  no i mean we dont want your credit card number  i mean we wont even know the number  we just need you to order the candy  and you have cash up front  he pay you back mr p when he sell off man  he gonna pay you back  points on the package huh   no way  aw come on mr pryzbo  i mean doesnt it teach us math addition subtraction  a quarter a 14 of a dollar a dime 110 you know  no cash no card  all right

msas in the 22 percentile  and dont think they havent noticed it  down at the puzzle palace  the word is theyre looking for at least a 10point increase  from all city middle schools this time around  were still 6 weeks away from the msas  and you want us to start teaching the test now  this year the preferred term is curriculum alignment  theres nothing wrong with emphasizing the skills  necessary for the msa  if we can get them to write a paragraph  without a 4letter word in it  itll have to have better command of english  marcia skill sets are one thing  but this has us teaching test questions direct  test questions that involve skills   i dont see your point  you dont want to see it  were you really expecting something different than last year  i dont see the math section these are all languagearts questions  our greatest failing on standardized tests last year  so for the time being  all teachers will devote class time  to teaching languagearts sample questions  now if you turn to page 11 please  i have some things i want to go over with you  i dont get it  all this so we score higher on the state tests  if were teaching the kids the test questions  what is it assessing in them  nothing it assesses us  the test scores go up  they can say the schools are improving  the scores stay down they cant  juking the stats  excuse me  making robberies into larcenies  making rapes disappear  you juke the stats and majors become colonels  ive been here before  wherever you go there you are  ravens got that dude mike anderson  he and jamal gonna be running  look at these

must have forgot  no i aint forget shit   what i forget anyway  that im the man  so whats the first thing we do  when we respond to a prompt  randy  according to the text  according to the text  thats good  and how do we end the answer  quenice  come on i know you know this  the above stated facts have led me to conclude that  right  ok so lets try to read the third paragraph  ill start it  pythias makes a final plea to the tyrant dionysius  to return to his home one last calvin pick it up  to return to his home one last time  before his punishment  he denies the request until damon inter  intercedes  and offers his own life until pythias returns  good  who wants to guess what intercedes means  what about plea  ok what about the story then  how would you summarize it  duquan give it a shot  according to the text  everybodys safe in the end right  lets think this through according to the text  damon offers his own life on behalf of pythias  so that he can return home one last time
