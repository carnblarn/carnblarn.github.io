preelection polls show that a significant number  of undecided and persuadable voters thought kerry over bush  offered a better chance for jobs   jobs may have been a marginal issue kate  in some of the rust belt battle ground states   but ultimately this was a referendum  on the leadership of george w bush  on the war against terror and the war in iraq   you are so full of shit  nothing mattered in the red states but the economy  ive been saying that for months  hey im not tossing you so quick tonight  i got nothing to do tomorrow  well im tossing myself  i gotta get home  you know what not

democratic national convention said  im here under old glory  that he wasnt trying to wrap himself in a flag too  no i dont think he was trying to wrap himself in a flag   i think he was trying to defend the people  in the battle ground states the ones who really   1942 the us first stormed the shore at guadalcanal   seizing a nearly complete airfield at moga point  which was renamed henderson field   and in anchorage and nearby tulagy  that would later be known as iron bottom sound  because of the number of ships sunk there in battle   the landings of the first day put nearly 11000 marines
