girl no disrespect but  tosha wasnt killed because she just happened by that mess  i think we all know that right  she was a player  we know that much  we got the science that says shed fired a gun  when it all went down  gun wasnt there for us to find  but that just means someone grabbed it up right  i mean your girl she uh  definitely had her say  when everybody else on that street was talking  am i wrong  well i got witnesses on the scene that said  she was there right in the middle of a drug robbery  boy by the name a omar was in on it too  nobody saying tosha was an angel  nobody saying that  but what are they saying  the crew tosha was runnin with  maybe they didnt throw the shot that killed her  but if they dont come to me early and tell the true story  i guarantee they wont breathe a free breath  until them cicadas come back  yall get the word to the right people  and youve spoken to the medical examiner correct  whats he say  he says its lumpy  lumpy  he says if an investigation can come up with a credible scenario  hes willing to change the cause of death to homicide  do you even have a suspect here  look i dont know how you city guys do it  but down here in annapolis we try to duck a punch or two  not lean into every last one  my county doesnt need another murder  im glad you could came  ladies reverend wright  id like you to meet my husband cedric daniels  nice to meet you  not that ive seen no   she was invited right  oh of course  eunetta doesnt make it too much nowadays  not even council meetings  i think eunettas gonna have her hands full

ticket through  mayors got a new poll showing his negatives  theyve really jumped in the last year  not that hes gonna be putting a press release out about that  i hear you took a swipe at hizzoner the other day  on that witness murder  not at the mayor directly  but we had the police brass in front of the subcommittee and  i dunno theres just no excuse for what happened  you keep on it councilman  a little smack here and there  does this administration a world of good  thats why we need new blood on the council  keep everybody honest  dont embarrass yourself  so  your murders never

past the police department who knows  and there we were some things that happened a long time ago  when i was in eastern  i guess she wanted more out of me  and after a lot of years and a lot of plans  it turns out i have a better head for police work  than i do for climbing the ladder  she hung in there thinking my career  was going to turn into some kind of big deal  and i probably let her believe it just to keep peace  now she wants to be the big deal  what do you want  i just dont want to disappoint her anymore  and right now  im more help showing up at some chicken dinner  in my wedding ring and dress blues  then being the notevendivorcedyet husband  with the white woman on his arm  im going to do what i can to see  she gets what she wants this time around  nothing more than

give a shit about tackling the problems  crime is outta fucking control  last week a kid witness in a drug case turns up  shot dead because of flaws in the system  i go to the mayor who promises action  and then mister reformismorethan  thewatchwordofmyadministration  pats me on the ass thanks me for my concern  points me out the door the end  so with crime as the issue  the great white father rides to the rescue  against a black incumbent mayor in a city thats 65 black  black white green people are pissed off  what makes you think this is doable  one i hear the mayors got problems in his base and with key supporters  two i got the police commissioner  royces own man telling me all kinds of stuff  about his fuckedup department and about royces inner circle  and three tony gray from the fifth district  comes pretty close to telling me hes thinking  about a run for mayor  thatd split the black vote  youd still need a player  who gives the black middleclass permission  to vote against one of their own  you got one of those in your pocket  not many of those around  elijah  congressional black caucus aint gonna save your skinny white ass  what about odell watkins  well its funny you should mention him  cuz i dont think hes too happy with the mayor right now  i dunno  i hear a new poll shows royces negatives are pretty high  youd have to raise a load of dough  he has to see it i know he sees it  its past that now  its about us showing some respect  oh fuck respect   he aint right  no he aint  but at this point  with you on the other side of the argument  hed rather be wrong  maybe if the word came down from on high  it might change his mind  i mean if your friend bunny colvins up to his ass in bodies  then hed take all the help he can get  not that youd ever go behind anybodys back  or anything like that right  no way  two more murders yesterday  and another three today  including a 14yearold  were doing all we can  youre at 260 for the year and its barely
