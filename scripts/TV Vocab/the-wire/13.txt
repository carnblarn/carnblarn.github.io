                hey now  we called earlier they said you were up  and by the time we get here youre back asleep  been there long no   you know we didnt want to exactly disturb you  im bored is all  yeah but still  so what you got for me  spreads yeah  little man for sure  thats good are you able to write  okay number two  i can make little man because hes in the front  trying to snatch the cash off the dashboard  but the other one hes outside in the dark  so so you know its okay  is there anyone here that you do recognize  sure weebey  all right  let me tell you where were coming from with the shooters  we tracked their escape route and landsman came up with their hoodies  now dna matched  human hair from one of the hoodies to weebey  freamon he tracked a call from the pay phone  near the scene to stringer bells pager  now the caller was using beys beeper code  crime lab they lift a print  off a soda can near that phone and that matches little man  you know so you know im saying  okay hear me out  theres a downside here  we dont have the guns  no prints from the scene no witnesses  but worse were going to be dealing with a baltimore city jury  and a good man is hard to find in this town  twelve of them together especially  an id of both your shooters  will play a whole lot easier come trial  yeah  sometimes things just got to play hard  we got everyone on our list except cco  we hit his mamas house  and she says that he went up to wabash for some court date  you can get on the computer and see if any of the sheriffs deputies  can snatch him up in some courtroom  yeah no we got ronnie moe  im looking at him go in the jail van right now  all right  fished our limit lets go home sir  huh lets go home sir  youre looking at a soontobemade sergeant  so what im saying is when were around the troops  you got to get used to showing the proper respect  so lets go home sir all right  whats the count  so far weve picked up 1 2 that leaves seven on the wing  anything worthwhile  some phone numbers that match scraps of nicknames not much else  we need something now  theyll shut us down unless we come up with something fresh to run with right now  the wires are dead the bug in the club is useless  theyre moving out of there even as we got up on them  to where no clue  but theyre going to have to set up again  either barksdale moves to reset his distribution  or he gives up the towers  if not avon then stringer and why not avon  with no priors hes out two hours after the bail review  what we put on barksdale barely makes him break stride  okay so we get a hint of where theyre setting back up  we ask the states attorney for a new bug  maybe even a wire if we get onto a phone  not while the deputy breathes air  well be reassigned before you finish typing up your affidavit  how about the feds  you think the deputys going to let you take this mess federal  why does the deputy need to know  mcnulty you are a piece of work  mcnulty  yeah  no shit  no fucking shit  its rhonda pearlman  she just got a call from an assistant public defender in north jersey  who claims to represent a man by the name of dangelo barksdale  meet me in homicide bring a tape recorder  no drug lawyers no levy  case got some legs on her dont she dont she  quarter of a million dollars bail you believe that shit  it hurts to even show that kind of money  where levy at he aint at the club is he no clubs out we cant talk there no more  come on man lets get out of here whats up baby  so this is it  look before you go anyplace else before you talk anyplace else  we got to think this through  were up to almost 20 arrests at last count  and if you look at the probable cause they all read just like yours  information from a confidential source  dont this seem way too much for one snitch  i agree my gut tells me a wire  either a phone or two or maybe something in a room somewhere  talked to your nephew on the phone about the jersey thing  no of course not man no phones  when i talk to him i talk to him facetoface in my office in the back of the club  fuck its good you moved out of there  i dont know man i mean if they got a mike up in there  they got you and me saying all kind of shit  that reminds me he said hed be in tonight  thing is they take you and leave me thats whats fucking me up too man  look well know soon enough as soon as i start pressing for discovery  what do you want to do about the people they locked up  we got to pull them thats showing a lot of money  if we dont we run the risk of making them enemies  speaking of which where are you with your nephew  is he going to see the light or what  let me tell you something man he family all right  he not going to buck  a day or two in the new jersey bullpen he gonna be crying  waiting for bail money like the rest of them  all right  so lets run the money through the families thatll hide it some  and dont use the same bondsman all right  look gentlemen i know its early  i want you to start thinking about who was charged  and what kind of time they can do  one of the ways to limit your exposure is whats called a structured plea  that means that youre going to have to deliver your people  all of them down to a man  i saw your girl today for the idents  hows she doing  okay i guess  shes out of the icu  moving slow but moving you know  jimmy you aint been to see her  no i couldnt go in  this aint about you right  i get back from jersey i will  i will  you know cole and me we showed her the spreads  picked out little man no problem  wouldnt go for weebey so i tried the fat finger  damn near down on my knees begging her  to make this play easier in court you know what she said  sometimes things got to play hard  real police  oh yeah  what the fuck did you do to her i dont know  you two in the same car going to make for a longass drive to jersey  shit  damn man its just too still in here  you know what we can  this place will be fine  all we really got to do is put a little safe in here someplace  and let them know the count comes here from now on  period  damn boy when yall change up yall  yall that paranoid you aint even been up in there before  im telling you sis this shit is different  we are not going to talk about nothing indoors its a new day  thing is man we got to get back on our feet  you know i mean the longer we hold off  the harder its going to be to maintain the towers  you want to get it back up you lean to me and string here  no i aint down yet you need to step back  shes right bro you cant take a second chance here  you know what im saying  until you fixed sis going to handle that money  im going to handle the products  were here for you all right  but you tell roberto he got to make it a serious smoker  i want them motherfucking fiends in the projects  i want them dropping like flies you feel me  you send out the word you let them know we aint dead yet  what about my nephew dont fret  give me a chance to get with roberto and ill get up to dee  do what needs doing  tell him im sorry for putting him out there like that  and that im going to make it up to him  you going to make it up  most def  but again i want to make it clear  that all of this cooperation is contingent on a commitment  that my client finds acceptable  failing that  everything said in here stays in here damn straight  im sure a proffer in maryland plays much the same in jersey counselor  and i do agree that with regard to matters  involving drug trafficking your client has been helpful  hes indicated a willingness to testify that he was a lieutenant  in avon barksdales drug distribution organization  sold large quantities of drugs for his uncle  delivered money attended organizational meetings  and on one occasion made a trip to new york on the behest of his uncle  all of which corroborates much of what we already know  what else is there  the murders  man why do you keep on that  i already told you  i dont know nothing about that witness being killed  which witness  remember her  jesus  they did her yeah about the same time they did the boy  all of them bodies  they covering up man yeah thats what we think  no loose ends i can understand the guard  she got paid so she had to go  orlando he knew too much got to snitching so he had to go  but then theres the kid  wallace  but i need to go past argyle street tonight check in with wallace  wallace  he off the hook since we helped the tower crew  get that stickup boy  im telling you man wallace is bugging  dont hardly even come out of that room no more  now why he be like that im thinking he might be getting high  wallace the boys scaring me with his shit  all right holler at me later thatll work  you got that shit on tape  god his name is brandon wright  burned him broke fingers gouged an eye out all kinds of fun  wallace was the one who saw  he saw the boy  but he really didnt think about what theyd do  you must have known you were standing there by that pay phone  you knew what was i going to do  i dont call string word get back uptown whats going to happen then  so you told wallace to wait then you called stringer  and stringer he gathered the troops  yeah  and down at the greeks they got wallace to point the finger right  then they went in like cops with handcuffs so they could take their time on brandon  they dropped the body where wed see it  send a message to the jects they said  wallace  he couldnt handle that  after seeing that he wanted to get out  go back to school  we even joked about it him being 16 and all  needing to go start back over again as a freshman  about a week ago my uncle and string they called me down to the club  stringer hes all worried about wallace and i told him  i said wallace aint no snitch  plus hes out the fucking game  i told him that  but i needed to do more  i shouldve done more  but i didnt and fuck thats on me  any idea who they sent at wallace  come on dee wild guess  man i dont know couldve been anybody you know shooters come cheap  i dont think so not in the pit  not in his crib i counted seven beds when i was up there  where were the younguns look if i knew i would tell you  all right i swear to god i would tell you  theyve charged with orlando and the undercover cop  but were still hunting  him he in philly  how you know i know cause i dropped him there  where  i dont know a corner north end i dont know where he be staying  did weebey say anything to you about the shootings  we dont talk shop in the car its a rule we got  so is that it  your client must realize that any agreement  is dependent on his full cooperation  there aint nothing else  deidre  tap tap tap  she was one of my uncles girls  but we got people who put you with her the night shes killed  yeah i didnt know that he was going to do her  i swear they played me  how so  my uncle gave me an eightball of coke  told me to take it over there to her  i was surprised cause you know i thought he dumped her  but he said no it wasnt like that no more  so he had weebey take me over there  you know i walked up knocked on the door  she came to the door all naked and shit with this littleass robe on  so shes your uncles girl but she comes to the door for you naked  she used to do that shit with me all the time man  teasing you know how girls do maybe you dont  i dont know  anyway im like aint you going to let me come in  she says no because she got to get ready  for my uncle to come by later  so i give her the coke  she laughs about how shes going to put that shit on ice for later on  refrigerate it  i dont know shit about no refrigerator like i said i didnt go in  i turned around started walking back to the truck  and i heard this shot  weebey he come running back with this bigass 45 he liked to use so much  tells me how he was tapping on the window real soft  how with the lights on she had to walk all the way up  because she couldnt see what was on the outside  and when she gets up to the window and looks out  you did good dangelo  yeah you did  yall dont understand man  yall dont get it  you grow up in this shit  my grandfather was butch stamford  you know who butch

what are you going to  hes got me if he wants me thing is i dont think he wants me  too much at stake  too much mess  kind of like this case  i have to admit it jimmy this is a great case  not just

including states witnesses  if you can help us squeeze the barksdale kid into a witness protection program  we can run wild with this thing  no suppliers though were still looking for a way into that  there was nothing on the wire that took us toward new york  the trouble is we have these post9l1 1 protocols  we cant pick up any new narcotics work  unless it goes to priority organizedcrime targets  meaning cosa nostra or colombians or russians maybe  we dont have any colombians in baltimore  we dont have any wise guys  all we got is a whole lot of locals a little busy tearing the westside apart  i hear you but the bureauwide protocol applies  to run with you on this we need a recognized oc target  or even better a connect to counterterrorism or corruption  you go near stuff like that  we have

from the phone company  says hes got the number you wanted for a house in philadelphia  beautiful thank you  good casework thank you  i dont think im giving anything away  by telling that arnold here has had a file on senator davis  for two and a half years  it took us a while to see it but the quid pro quo is right there  in that westside redevelopment mess  barksdale or his fronts grease enough city politicians  and word comes back years in advance where the development zones going to be  he buys up every piece of garbage real estate he can  flips it three or four times exaggerating the values  the citys gonna pay him millions  to condemn the properties for the renewal project  its a lot to work with but were willing  the question is can your cooperator give us the senator  or any other political figure  the cooperator dangelo barksdale  what does he have for us on the money  nothing  he gives you the drugs and the violence  he gives you avon barksdale stringer bell  and they give us the senator maybe yeah  youre talking about turning barksdale and bell into cooperators  and making the politicians the primary target  of course  no fuck the politicians its barksdale and bell  no fuck the politicians its barksdale and bell  those guys have turned west baltimore into a freefire zone  no ones saying they walk  what you are saying is that if we bring you the case  its your intention to let barksdale and bell reduce any sentence  they get through cooperation  jesus christ are you kidding youre seeing all this assbackwards  detective in this office we have a mandate to pursue political corruption  can you believe these guys  jimmy look what  drugs and murder dont cut it anymore how about terrorism  these guys have dropped 14 15 bodies the witnesses cooperators

trying to pin some politicians pelt to the wall  thought you was real police brother  so they got you all the way out here  i started out thinking you was in jersey  you aint in jersey  i figured they

lieutenant  anything you want to tell me  been weeks now  the deputy ops knows whats going on in this unit almost before i do  except last week  we run the bug up into barksdales club office  and burrell for once hes a step behind  you see it  maybe he i see it  i look around the office  and i see that one of my people is at the academy for inservice  lieutenant i swear it wasnt my idea  im minding my business doing my fucking job  when the man calls me for coffee and a danish  i mean i never even been on the eighth floor of that fucking building  and theres the deputy fucking ops  telling me how concerned he is about the case  how he needs to be informed  i mean hes the deputy fucking ops man  couple weeks from now  youre gonna be in some district somewhere  with 1 1 or 1 2 uniforms looking to you for everything  and some of them are going to be good police  some of them are going to be young and stupid  a few are going to be pieces of shit  but all of them will take their cue from you  you show loyalty they learn loyalty  you show them its about the work itll be about the work  you show them some other kind of game then thats the game theyll play  i came on in the eastern  and there was a pieceofshit lieutenant hoping to be a captain  pieceofshit sergeants hoping to be lieutenants  pretty soon we had pieceofshit patrolmen trying to figure the job for themselves  and some of what happens then is hard as hell to live down  comes a day youre going to have to decide whether its about you or about the work  grand jury came in tuesday  but you knew that right  were working a flight warrant today  theres a lot to do here inoffice  id be careful with that though  i understand the trigger pull used to be light  keep him down keep him down  you got him get him up there get him up  bunch of lowbottom bitches  get his wrists yall didnt have to fuck with my ride  motherfuckers got lucky  yeah  podunk lawyer in dentons giving the guards a hard time  about moving dangelo from original jurisdiction  put the call through  okay  officer mace asa pearlman you got a problem with the lawyer  okay put the asshole on  this is he  you do not make it easy jimmy i have to admit i am deeply ambivalent  excuse me sit  sit  here i heard from bunk  philly great work  you all did great work  and the number of clearances im looking at here  christ for the first time this year we got the clearance rate up over 40  thats on the one hand  on the other hand i know the deputy ops got a call from the first deputy  us attorney this morning  asking whether an asshole such as yourself really works for us  of course this is the first the deputy hears his troops  are creeping behind his back to take a case federal  when theyve already been told the case is closed  youre a good detective  and ive got to admit you got some stones on you  did you actually call the first deputy an empty suit  i want to see you land okay jimmy  so tell me where dont you want to go  you all know that baltimore city jurors are capable of just about anything  now look you want to sit around for months on end  going through a bunch of halfheard  halfsaid telephone conversations and see how well you do  ill certainly respect the effort its not just talk on the wire  weve got seized money and lot of dope on the table  and a lot of violence  all of which stops way short of mr barksdale  you know this  all of it except for the new jersey bust that one he eats  maybe he does  maybe he pleads to one count of attempted possession  and takes i dont know maybe three four  maybe he can arrange for everyone you have  on those tapes to follow suit  maybe you get fiveyear pleas from those with no prior felony convictions   what about the murders  maybe we acknowledge youve got mr brice cold for  murder of orlando blocker and wounding of the police officer  who weebey  representing mr brice  im fairly confident that to avoid the death penalty  hell proffer to at least a half dozen of your open murders  naming coconspirators  for that kind of cooperation id be willing to consider straight life  no indeed  i believe mr brice is ready to take sole responsibility  for all of his crimes  still you walk away with at least a halfdozen clearances  assets  you take the strip club you take whatever trucks and cars  you can link to the drug trafficking and also whatever cash youve seized  hes got dozens of other properties the funeral parlor the towing company  no you get the cars because you can tie them to illegal activity  no you get the cars because you can tie them to illegal activity  but theres nothing else of his to take  so you keep most of the money most of the real estate  and stringer bell stays on the street with his hand on the throttle  if you have a charge against mr bell file it  otherwise i understand that nothing in all those hours of tape implicates him  three or four years aint enough maury  not for avon barksdale  no  make an offer  part 14 of the circuit court of baltimore city now in session  be seated first up  be seated first up  state versus avon randolph barksdale your honor  one count of possession with intent to distribute  to wit a kilogram of heroin  you have a statement of facts yes your honor  mr barksdale is offering a plea of guilty  in exchange for a maximum of seven years in doc  in consideration of the following agreedupon facts  on or about the date of september 17 2002  in the jurisdiction of essex county new jersey  trooper robert warren of the newark barracks  effected a traffic stop on a rented ford taurus  traveling southbound near exit 13  that traffic stop resulted from information gleaned  from electronic surveillance of mr barksdale and his nephew dangelo barksdale  by detectives assigned to a special detail  under the command of a city narcotics supervisor  a search of the vehicle rented from the avis location at bwi airport  revealed that a kilogram of nearly pure heroin  was concealed beneath the spare tire in the car trunk  in accepting this plea mr barksdale acknowledges his role in procuring  those drugs with the intent to dilute package and sell retail amounts of heroin  deidre kresson roland leggett toreen boyd all tied to the same gun  plus we got the stickup boys brandon wright john bailey  with orlando that makes six  plus the attempted murder on a police  that it  i do better if i give them more life no parole means what it says  this proffer keeps you off death row thats all it does  you were on the wrong side of a cop getting shot mr brice  you want to dream about straight life for these bodies  you got to wake up talking about avon barksdale  and stringer bell no  but for murders you might as well give them what you have  because anything you leave out is outside the deal  if they learn about it later they can charge you later  fuck it then  for another pit sandwich and some potato salad  ill go a few more  how you want that medium rare a lot of horseradish  all right i did little man  thinking he might get weak on that cop getting shot  yeah wheres the body  druid hill behind the reptile house  you get back in them weeds you might could find whats left of him  all right thats seven what else you got  how about them witnesses  the security lady and whats his name the maintenance man  gant  yeah gant  you did gant alone  theyre out of potato salad how about slaw  information gleaned from electronic surveillance  would also show that mr watkins aka ronnie moe  was integrally involved in the distribution of heroin and cocaine in the highrises  at 734 fayette and 221 north fremont  in exchange for his pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy  he agrees to a sentence not to exceed 15 years in doc  mr watkins who is on probation for a drug distribution charge  that was adjudicated in judge prevas court in august 2001   cedric  major cantrell  congrats thanks  so where they sending you northwest spurgeons retiring  i

tell you how i run this unit because how i run it is how it runs  we work on a strict rotation youre up until you catch a call  then you step down work your case and someone else steps up behind you  this is the way we do business in a town with 250 300 murders a year  and it works  you do not play the game for yourself you play it for us  if you remember these few rules  youll find me to be supportive and reasonable  very reasonable sir  thats what they say about me they say that they do  yo dink  what the fuck was that  you take a niggers money then you serve him  what the fuck  im saying you take their money  then you send them round and let some other nigger serve  the way you doing it  someone snapping pictures got the whole deal  you hear  we got to tighten up around here yo  jimmy  hell of a case  read all about it in the papers  you done good kiddo  i gotta  dangelo barksdale supervised distribution  in the lowrise courtyards and was also involved  in the violence attributed to the organization  further he was arrested by authorities in new jersey  in possession of a kilo of raw heroin intended for distribution in baltimore  he acknowledges his role as a leading conspirator  and is already on parole for two earlier counts of distribution  dating from march 1999  what are you asking here  as mr barksdale has two prior convictions and is insisting that
