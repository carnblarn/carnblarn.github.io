slingin since i was maybe 1 2  and how long were you with barksdales crew in the lowrises  with dangelo not long  he came down from the towers at the beginning of the summer  before that i worked for ronnie mo  dangelo ever talk to you about what happened in the 221 building  with pooh getting shot  how about anything else like that  like what killings murders  he say anything about a girl getting shot in an apartment up on the eastside  he  no dee he was good to me he all right  but dangelo he was who you called that night when you saw  the stickup boy at the greeks right  yeah but he didnt go up there  it was mostly those tower boys  and stringer you said stringer was in the truck  he called you over asked you to point out the stickup boy  all of it corroborated by the beeper logs  and the pen registers from the project pay phones  stinkums dead weve already got bird for the gant killing  this ties them all in dangelo too  maybe but since he didnt show at the greeks  he tells the jury he didnt see the murder coming  its enough to charge him anyway  parents  alcoholic mother in the wind no fixed address  says hes got a grandmother on the eastern shore  but he hasnt seen her in years  how about a hotel room on whose dime  no way the deputy approves the manpower to stash a 16yearold  much less the room service  mcnulty line 2  how about you run this up to front office see if the states attorney will kick in  hes a kid cedric  even if we clear the money do you really wanna put a juvenile  in a hotel for six months waiting on a trial date  i think you all need to get with grandma down on the shore  now shes doing this right now  they dont have to set a hearing date or something like that  christ yeah okay yeah  i fuckin need a fuckin lawyer  what  still you can see that they got the security bars  and look there  cameras that see over the yard out to the street  and i checked with verizon theres no phone service at that address  thats a telltale right there  so what we try to write a warrant for this place right  right  what are you seeing no pattern really  except this cluster of old storefronts  and warehouses on the west side of downtown  around paca utah howard street mostly  storefronts vacants usually  three different holding companies  detective pryzbylewski what  you have a gift for the paper trail  tomorrow calls for some street work though are you street ready  you know the lieutenant has me inoffice i dont have my gun until the grand jury  you wont need one on the street no gun  no gun not for this  furthermore mr mcnulty having utilized his sons  in an act of police work involving a criminal suspect  actually lost track of them in a crowded municipal market  this is simply unacceptable your honor  be that as it may an emergency ex parte order  is an extraordinary request mr palmer  you actually want me to limit visitations to afternoons only and you want  mrs mcnulty present at all visitations come on  it is not a single lapse judge  mr mcnulty has time and again failed to properly care for the children  when theyre in his custody  i have a list of recent events your honor that justify an order  ms pearlman you have a response youd like to offer up here  nope  nothing  if this were possession with intent id be a prosecutor with a plan  but a domestic order hearing your honor im officially clueless  in fact as an employee of the state i should not actually be here  all right listen up people  before you have me make a ruling on an emergency petition  everybody here just needs to take a deep breath  literally come on  now then is mr mcnulty capable  of having a civil conversation with mrs mcnulty  yes your honor  and is mrs mcnulty equally capable of having a conversation with mr mcnulty  yes good then im going to lunch  lets see when i return if we cant busy this court  with something just a little more engaging than the problems of the mcnultys  look the charge is on me i understand that ill carry that  but the least our people can do  is throw down a little something to pay the bondsman  thats the deed of transfer for the club  the other thing is a license transfer application for the liquor board  theyre both backdated and notarized for last week  what  a front has to be clean  and right now you aint that sign  i want my bail paid you send me a bondsman ill sign  is that what you want me to tell him  that i asked you to sign and you wouldnt  you wanted to be in the game right  now youre in the game  unbelievable you show up with her  elena you went for an emergency ex parte  i grabbed

fish  wendell o as in  ohshitltriedtobuy fromastatepolice blocker  that wouldnt be wendell orlando blocker would it  yeah you on it  orlando  they keep that back room locked  and even if i do get back

all right but who else was there  i dont really see that well without my glasses  where are your glasses  you cant see faces without those  you dont wear those while youre working do you darlin  would you i gotta live off drinks and tips  no way why not  because a player wouldnt be the name on the liquor license  hed have a connect for barksdales coke  he wouldnt walk into state troopers  he got a charge and now hes talking out his ass  youre never gonna get avon or stringer in the same room as the dope  we make this case on their voices alone so maybe he cant buy from barksdale  maybe he can only buy from savino or weebey  fuck him then  we already got weebey tied to a murder and savinos the runt of the litter  we can take what orlando gives us about the club  the money laundering maybe or the girls  for that kind of cooperation ill drop a few years and call it fair  daniels in here yeah  call from deputy commissioner for you you want it in here  no  he doesnt miss much  i need some help here come on bubs  you got me coming across town in the middle of a fuckedup workday  just so you can hold 10 that shit aint right  hold on i dont need 10 okay  i dont know i need a place of my

couple hundred dollars  all right well talk  i gotta be somewhere tonight so hit me on my page tomorrow  tomorrow  i got you  the cooperator says he can buy weight not from barksdale or bell  how can you be sure  how much dope or coke do you think gets avon barksdale into the room  a kilo 2 kilos 20 kilos  we are not going to buy our way up the ladder here  these people do not touch the drugs they dont go near the drugs  the wire is what gives us barksdale  it gives us the whole crew  day by day piece by piece  buybust lieutenant  its what i asked you for months ago its what we do successfully  time and again to make these cases  why new york  must be something happening out there too big a town you know what i mean  you dont believe in the truce thats why i asked for that money  if he had said we aint paying just be happy to live  id have been like they keeping it real  but he say come on down for 5000 im like man please  look here homes i aint asked for much but im a little light on traveling money  im saying i could go around the block and get myself paid but im thinking  you keep in touch with my pager were gonna need you for the gant trial  go easy omar  stay free  you be picking me up outside the cutrate on lex and fulton  i be up there after 1000 right  thatll work  listen up people  weve got 30000 in buy money courtesy of our friends over at dea  but the thing is they cant have that money walking on them  definitely not  so kima will be in the car for the buy fronting as our cls girl  looking the part too  now wheres your weapon gonna be  he might pat me so it has to stash in the car  i figure when savino gets in the car at the cutrate  ill be going in back itll be up under the rear seat  and we probably cant be close enough for an eyeball on this  but the car will be a live wire  and kima will be throwing us  i only want to remind mr blocker here  that his plea agreement is contingent on cooperation  and a buybust on savino bratton is less cooperative  than a buybust from someone higher up on the food chain  if you can get savino talking about avon or stringer  thats better for us and better for you  they already know that he got jacked on a reverse buy right  why wouldnt they assume hes snitching i need money for a lawyer right  thats the story  he got popped and now he needs to get right back into it  to pay the bondsman and the lawyer  all
