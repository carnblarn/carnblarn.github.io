anything publicly  so then hes not gonna go public right  judge phelan called this morning  crying about a witness in his murder trial who was killed  did the judge say where he heard it  he heard it from our man mcnulty  thats his pipeline on this crap  pardon my french but i got no problem giving that asshole up at this point  i dont need people i cant trust yeah who does  the newspapers get hold of this itll be a complete clusterfuck  okay so the thing to do is reassure the judge  keep him off his damn soapbox  an arrest or two would help  what if its true  what if barksdale ordered the murder of a states witness  are you serious  why would anyone do that after the witness testifies  it has no effect on the case payback plain and simple  bullshit plain and simple  look i know there could be two dozen other reasons  for this man to be murdered but what if  no money for pretrial no witness protection program  look this is a poor fucking city gentlemen  the last thing we ever need to do is to announce we lost a witness  i mean its hard enough pushing felony casework  through that courthouse as it is  you got to pull mcnulty off this who caught the murder case  bunk moreland mcnultys partner then youd have to pull him too  no we pull mcnulty up the judge will bring the press into this  i can see that a mile away  no were gonna sit tight let mcnulty take his best shot  and hope like hell he comes up short  how do you wanna handle this we got nothing on him  we try to front hell see right through us  hes scared though soft  go with the deuce  hold up hold up  he part of my case no sir  hes a potential suspect in my murder  which might be part of my case  i could use some coffee you want some coffee  i need a word with you were just about to go  now  you remember all that bullshit i gave you about keeping me informed  about nothing happening that i dont know about  lieutenant wasnt bullshit  my partner caught a murder it may have nothing with barksdale at all  i just came from deputy ops office  where your own majors telling burrell to do you  you hear me rawls is giving you up  what the fuck did i do you cant shut your mouth  you think that downtown judge is gonna bail your ass out on this  you really think that you should have come to me  we bring this business to the deputy first we got a shot  but no youre out there all alone jumping bad  you got the deputys ear on this case i do  then how come they sent every worthless hump in plainclothes  you ask for men they send you drunks and fuckups  i want to do this case  so do l  then youre gonna get all the way in lieutenant  if i see you get all the way in then i know who you are what youre about  who is he dangelo barksdale  nephew to the king thats the one that beat the murder  yeah him  what do you have to connect him to the dead witness  not a thing why did you pick him up  press him see what kind of flex he shows  she goes in with you we dont need her  bunk and me we got our own rhythm  you want me in mcnulty i thought you said you wanted me in  youre along for this interview but its homicides play so let him lead  you might want to run tag and title on these two trucks  they scoped us when we jacked the kid been there  infos already in the file  yall werent the only lawmen down in the canyon today  really where were you where was she  i mean the thing is i cant see a reason for that man to be dead  i cant i mean hell you beat us in court  we dont take it personal fuck no  we get paid either way and its not like you did anything real bad  throwing a couple of hot ones at pooh blanchard  no ones gonna miss that motherfucker  but you know the man who got killed this time  you know who that poor son of a bitch was  a citizen  worked every goddamn day of his life you know that  he would get up every day go out and do maintenance work  then on the weekends he was driving a cab out to the airport  two jobs  and he volunteers what little time he has left at his church  churchgoing man a bethel man a deacon  two jobs and three kids did you know that  three kids young too  five eight eleven  crying their little orphaned asses to sleep  cause they lost their mama some years ago  and now they out there on their own  he doesnt believe us i know he dont believe it  weve been here two hours telling you whats true in the world  and you sit like nothing happened  where my lawyer at  we called him when he comes well let you know  i got nothing to say  i mean im sorry for the man but i aint got nothing to say  you sorry you sorry for him you fucking killed the man  no yes you did  we dont think that you shot him but if you werent so busy  iighting folks up in highrise lobby  he aint coming out of the elevator and see it happen  he dont see anything he doesnt testify  he doesnt testify those kids still got a daddy to lean on  whyd he testify how would we know  he didnt have to testify no he didnt but he did  and you still beat the charge didnt you  but that wasnt enough its not enough to beat the murder  they gotta send a cold message to everyone in the terrace  fuck the working man fuck his kids that shit dont count  see thats what i dont get about the drug thing  why cant you sell the shit and walk the fuck away  you know what i mean everything else in this country gets sold  without people shooting each other behind it  in the terrace its one body after another  you remember that little boy  got shot in the barbershop on west lombard last summer  one asshole chases another into a house  empties a 9  bullshit argument over 20 missing gelcaps  and that little kid instead of getting his first haircut  he gets one in the eye  you remember that  its fucked up yes it is  its fucked up yes it is  they didnt have to do that  shoot up a barber shop  no they did not have to do that  that man was just  my thing  my thing they aint had  they aint had to do that  no mama and no daddy  lord jesus  ill tell you what i think you should do dangelo  not because i think you wanted that man to get shot  or had anything to do with shooting him  but i think you could just sit here  for a moment or two collect your thoughts  you know get your shit together  and then i think it might be a good thing  for you to write a little letter to those children  and you let them know youre sorry  that theyre not gonna have anyone left you know  i mean just say something  tell them how you personally think your uncle  maybe he got it wrong this time because its wrong  that they lost their daddy behind what happened you know  it might mean something to them to know that youre feeling for them  man i aint got nothing to say  just say whats in your heart  church deacon that was thick  got good to me what can i say  its sad enough with the kids being orphaned and everything  photo was from bunks desk  theyre yours yeah afraid so  good thing they look like their mama  maurice levy just posted hes by the elevators  the defense never rests

field interviews sir police work  police work yeah  i got a 14yearold in critical but stable condition at university  and two witnesses who say one of you princes  coldcocked him with the buttend of a pistol  no sir i got his mother over at lid  filing a formal brutality charge  which for herc will make an even four in the last two years  none sustained but all of them true  we thought that  i got one less crown vic than i had last night  im out two kevlar vests that burned in the car  two handheld radios a shotgun  and im about to lose this idiot here for a week or two of medical  and for what  what did you all learn when you went to the terrace  at 200 in the morning to conduct field interviews  what valuable information did we acquire from this situation  iid is gonna be on all three of you by afternoon  and if you dont get a story straight by then  youre gonna have a file thick enough to see the light of a trial board  now tell me who coldcocked the kid  me  why  he pissed me off  no officer pryzbylewski he did not piss you off  he made you fear for your safety and that of your fellow officers  im guessing now but maybe  he was seen to pick up a bottle and menace officers hauk and carver  both of whom had already sustained injury from flying projectiles  rather than use deadly force in such a situation  maybe you elected to approach the youth ordering him to drop the bottle  maybe when he raised the bottle in a threatening manner  you used a kellight not the handle of your service weapon  to incapacitate the suspect  go practice  you fuck the bullshit up when you talk to lnternal  i cant fix it youre on your own  push the arraignments back to 300 and the gillette case  the gillette trial goes back on the move docket  come on walk with me im running late  it wasnt me
