always right  were in the projects  the customer be fucked up you cant give these niggers shit man  why not why cant you  shit everything else in the world get sold without people taking advantage  scamming lying doing each other dirty  why has it got to be that way with this cause they dope fiends  yeah but the game aint gotta be played like that  you cant tell me this shit cant get done without people beating on each other  killing each other doing each other like dogs  without all that  you aint got 50 here on our backs every five minutes  throwing us around and shit shit man  you think 50 would care about niggers getting high  in the projects  man 50 be down here about the bodies  thats what they be down here about the bodies  squires young squires what you want nigger  a little bag of styles man a little bag of styles for you  check it out  only 5 whats up with that  5 make you a gallant motherfucker right there boy  him we know  what are we facing from the riot  three witnesses statements  all of them saying the officers assault  on the youth was unprovoked  you know how that goes commissioner  peoples idea of police brutality is whenever we win a fight  what does the states attorney say  he says it goes to a grand jury  thats him doing pontius pilate  the grand jury doesnt indict he looks clean for passing the buck  and if they do indict they wont  criminal histories on our three witnesses  one longer than the next  drugs weapons assault  more drugs  shitbirds throwing dirt at good police  just the same lieutenant  i want you to rethink  whatever tactic led you to send three plainclothes officers  to do field interviews at the highrises at 200 in the morning  yes sir  i take it your people have union counsel  yes sir  sir i would request  that pending the grand jury review  officer pryzbylewski be placed on administrative leave  i can use him inoffice but we shouldnt have him on the street  until the grand jury signs off  thats putting our tail between our legs i think our official stance has to be  he did nothing wrong out there  a 14yearold is halfblind  and two of ours were injured as well  goddamn right they were fucking shooting at us out there  bobby what do you think  keep him off the streets  until it clears the courthouse  okay then well wait on the grand jury  lieutenant a moment please  what happened out there  did you know they were in the highrises without backup  if i tell you yes  i screwed up  if i tell you no  im putting my men in the jackpot  do you still want me to answer  i screwed up sir  good man willing to take one for the company  to hell with the company  im defending my own people here thats all  what major valchek means to say is that hes grateful that you  extended your support on behalf of officer pryzbylewski  fuckup that he is he should be off the street  what can i say the kid needs  a little guidance a little supervision  stan here thought that if he got a young officer back on the street  where he might start over  a new unit a new lieutenant  you know that it might bring him around i understand he messed up here  i understand that  which is why im saying to you  i owe you  for walking him through this grand jury thing  and to compensate southeastern is sending you  two new unmarked units and a surveillance van  plus you need manpower  while these guys are busy with this lid thing  all you do is ask  lieutenant  so ive got suction with you valchek  thats what im saying  deputy always a pleasure  a necessary evil  what valchek  is it insubordinate if i ask whats so necessary  thanks for not cutting pryzbylewski loose  if you had the department would be caught between valchek and city hall  i owe you for that  this barksdale  hes dug in  it may take more than buybust  and since its been in the press about the witness  its not an issue  keep it a tight little circle  give me three weeks of good street work and youll see this through  a couple of felony warrants a little dope on the table  thats all we need here  under no circumstances is it accurate to suggest  that this particular homicide was the result of the victim  having been a witness in an earlier case  reports to the contrary are without factual merit  are you saying that you know definitely that this man was not killed  because he testified  we think that  i mean that is  were looking into the possibility that mr gant  was involved in a street dispute  which of course would have nothing to do  with his being a witness  in an unrelated case that concluded weeks ago  but you havent developed a suspect at this time  no we havent  bunk shame on you lad  what did you expect him to do  i dont know grab the mike  shove rawls to the ground declare that all of baltimore  should rise as one because theyre murdering witnesses in cold blood  that sounds more like one of your moves  been working on him two weeks we dont even have a photo  its fucking embarrassing  hey pat  we got a job for you guys to try to run down  what is it  we need a photo of this guy barksdale  we need to know what he looks like  so go down to the b of l you see thats the problem guys  barksdales never been arrested as an adult  so we dont really have a b of i photo  he had his juvenile record expunged so theres no photo there either  then youre fucked  yeah we are  but seeing as we all came into work today i thought lets try something different  we know from his mothers social service record  that barksdale grew up in franklin terrace right  it occurred to me  being vaguely familiar with the highrises of west baltimore  that the housing project began to take photos  of every registered resident as a security measure  am i correct detective greggs yeah  so you want us to go down to the housing department  and pull his photo excellent  you know you and l we think as one were like two horses together in a harness  why dont you fucking do it yourself  sure if you dont mind sitting in my desk reviewing homicide folders  taking meticulous notes trying to run down a few new leads  its boring painstaking work but if you dont want  to travel to the housing department ill switch with you  fuck it patrick lets take a ride  that was inspiring im a leader of men  whats up with shop no reup  why not cause we out of red caps  stink say we gonna have a new package tomorrow  new package  yeah man this weakass steppedon shit we got out here  get these fiends agitated  look at them they still buying it though  yes theyre buying twice as much and only getting half as high  what was that  castle cant move like that  castle move up and down or sideways like  no we aint playing that look at the board were playing checkers  checkers yeah checkers  whyre yall playing checkers on a chess set  why do you give a shit  man we aint got no checkers  yeah but chess is a better game  so  no hold up  yall dont know how to play chess do you  so so nothing man  ill teach yall if you want to learn come on man no come on  were right in the middle of a game chill out i want to see this  yall cant be playing no checkers on no chessboard  all right man  look check it its simple  see this  this is the kingpin  and he the man  you get the other dudes king you got the game  but hes trying to get your king too so you gotta protect it  now the king he moves one space  any direction he damn choose cause hes the king  like this all right  but he aint got no hustle  but the rest of these motherfuckers on the team  they got his back  and they run so deep he really aint gotta do shit  like your uncle yeah like my uncle  you see this this is the queen  shes smart and shes fierce  she moves any way she wants as far as she wants  and she is the gogetshitdone piece  remind me of stringer  and this over here is the castle  its like the stash  it moves like this  and like this  dog stash dont move man  come on think  how many times we move the stash house this week  and every time we move the stash  we got to move a little muscle with it to protect it  true youre right  all right what about them little baldheaded bitches right there  these right here  these are the pawns theyre like the soldiers  they move like this one space forward only  except when they fight  then its like  or like this  and they like the front lines they be out in the field  so how do you get to be the king  it aint like that  see the king stays the king all right  everything stays who he is  except for the pawns  now if a pawn  makes it all the way down to the other dudes side  he gets to be queen  and like i said the queen aint no bitch  she got all the moves  all right so  if i make it to the other end i win  if you catch the other dudes king and trap it then you win  but if i make it to the end  im top dog  no it aint like that look  the pawns man in the game  they get capped quick  they be out of the game early  unless theyre some smartass pawns  nagras can you fucking believe this  this shit is prehistoric  what else have they got down there in property  eighttracks victrolas that fucking departments a joke  we got to get with the feds somehow  they got lightweights wireless

depended on it  that too you looked at daniels specifically  we did a twomonth assets investigation  the man has a couple hundred thousand more in liquid assets  than any police lieutenant should ever have  maybe he goes to atlantic city seriously  you look at his background maybe hes got other sources of income  maybe we never got the chance to go further  why not  we went to your deputy for operations and told him what we had  you took it to burrell he says well take it from here  so we backed away and waited for something to happen  and waited that was a year ago  maybe more  and that fuckers still the supervisor for narcotics  so you tell me what the hells going on  anyway if hes running your case i just thought youd want to know  thanks
