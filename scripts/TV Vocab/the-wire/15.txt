message  i had people working on a window for the nave up st casmirs since easter  you know that  i took money from half a dozen different people  told them where it was gonna go   you tell father lewandowski  i was gonna surprise him  yeah you surprised everybody now theres one window too many right  heres the thing father lew says  he could take another window in the rectory on the second floor   good for you  no good for you frank  you dont want my finger in your eye you better do whats right here  whats right  whats right would be for you to come down here to my house  like a decent human being and ask a common courtesy  but thats not you its not your way  my old man always said you were a halfass punk  over at holy redeemer as a kid  my sister said you were a pain in the ass pest at all them cyo dances  where none of the girls would even look at you  damn near everyone at the point said when you got your badge  it was too much for anybody named valchek to have a patrolmans drag  and sure enough youve been an official asshole every day since  fuck you and your window  where are you gonna be  im gonna go find some lunch somewhere maybe   give me an hour yeah  yeah   what the fuck is this  a knot  why dont you just do bunny ears  so what else we got  medics clothes bedrolls thats it   heres a letter though  a letter what language  who knows same backwardsass writing though  thats like russian or something im telling you  cant figure the name or the address  but the stamp says magyar on it   wheres magyar  what the hell do i look like rand mcnally  which one of your detectives caught all the dead girls  detectives theyre at the bar already  these yours  they chalked it up as an accidental and dumped the paperwork on us  she found them she writes on it   im mcnulty city marine unit  beatrice russell   you got any ids yet  no visas or passports  a few scraps of paper but nothing to make sense of  russian alphabet on most of it you just curious   yeah  why  day before yesterday i fished out a jane doe from near the bridge  theres no missing person report on file  we got 14 bedrolls and 13 bodies   mine was a murder  a murder youre kidding me  we got some photos if you wanna take a look  i called the morgue this morning  the only thing they can say is the dental work isnt local  overseas they think   is that your girl  think so  looks better here  you got her in the water day before yesterday out by the bridge   why would you have a murdered girl in the water  and the rest of them are suffocating in a can at patapsco   what went wrong  air pipe up top got crushed  happened when cargo shifted around most likely  they had cargo up front of the container with a false back after about 25 feet  you had cartons stacked in front  but a tight passage to a small door in the false wall  opens from the outside only   theyre in here the whole trip  probably not  once theyre at sea theres usually someone in the crew  whos in on it you know a shepherd  he lets them out to eat move around use the bathroom whatever  they were clawing at the wall for air  thats what the medical examiner said anyway   wheres the air pipe  thats the hole pipes up top  you get a lot of stowaways  some usually its customs or ins that finds them  most are dominicans or haitians or from that part of the world anyway   not so much from europe  a bit more since 911 actually  i think because people cant get in on visas anymore  like they used to there you go  usually if the shepherd is doing his job  he tries to put a can like this on bottom of the stack  so they can pop it and the girls just walk out on the floor of the hold  where was this one   look  what   that look right to you  what do you mean   you said you were with the marine unit  yeah  what does the marine unit have to do with a bunch of dead girls in a can  not a thing  what do you want me to do  you can go to father lew ask him to give sobotka back his money  switch the windows maybe  you ever in your life seen a priest give money back  the guy pays for a window he gets a window  i thought you had suction  at city hall i got suction down annapolis i got suction  but who but the pope has any drag with the cardinal get over it  how the fucks he get that kind of money anyway  now thats a good question  i mean the whole ibs cant have 1500 guys left in this town  and there aint 100 checkers  they got the car ships coming in  the rollonrolloff cargo is keeping them afloat   thats all they got  pretty much  past six months ibs hired bruce dibiagos people  to lobby for them down in annapolis  theyve been good with the political contributions  theyre throwing around a lot of cash   how can they  you tell me  dibiago does not come cheap this is real money were talking  you know what i think  i think francis sobotkas into some dirt  youre the cop not me  the grainery  so i hear burrells gonna be the next police commissioner  yeah ive seen worse  see if its crushed by another container it shouldve been one single movement  maybe two if something shifts and then shifts back again  this looks like someone has been pounding on it in a bunch of spots  see  before i rule it i wanna go down with a metallurgist to be sure  but yeah from the look of it  you just bought yourself 13 homicides congratulations  if the commissioner goes down to washington its you right  thats for the mayor to decide id have to clear the council too  if the mayor wants you thats not much of a problem  you been around as long as me you make a few enemies  what the first district guys theyre not gonna start nothing   theyre pushing shipley  see thats racist  you know it personally offends me that anybody would reach down past you  to elevate some colonel just because he happens to be white  you know what im gonna do  im gonna get on the phone and call my friends at the hall  thatll bring the first district in line  thats very kind  and what if anything is there that i can do for you maj valchek  funny you should ask i need a detail  cid people mostly though i can spare some bodies out of my district too  what for  i got some guys in the southeast that are showing a lot of money   port guys longshoremen  ibs  im not talking about going after the whole union  just a couple of guys in one local that look fat  drugs maybe or the usual thieving   frank sobotka you heard the name  no  and im not saying the problem even goes past him   whats he to you  to me  hes an asshole  six men for six weeks  rawls will pick them  you ordered
