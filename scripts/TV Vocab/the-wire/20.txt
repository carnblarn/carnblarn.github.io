dirt   so when they lose a can  i see it go  gentlemen ladies  the future is now  to bring goods to an exploding global economy  and to deliver those goods faster cheaper and safer  modern robotics do much of the work in the worlds largest seaport rotterdam  moving cargo is a traditional strength of the dutch  who shuttle more freight in fewer manhours than any port in the world  and now the dutch have modeled the future of cargo management  completely containerized cargo arrives and departs  on ships a third of a mile long  smart card technology provides greater security  and improved accountability with no need for unreliable human surveillance  frog man we light five caps is all man  im saying you getting all ridiculous over bits and pieces you feeling me  nigger its the

over there  i dont have those figures handy im sorry  but rotterdam does employ 4000 people    thats right  thats efficiency nat  by eliminating some of the more dangerous work  the rotterdam technologies have reduced  employee workrelated accidents and injuries by 60  i think we can all be happy with that cant we  question yes  the gps readings are they exact  you cant get hurt if you
