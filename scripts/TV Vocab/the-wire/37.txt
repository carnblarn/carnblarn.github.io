in daniels wiretap case  so a hit drug related  with a big time developer in the middle  whats the fit  second vic russell bell  owner and codeveloper of this here  and other downtown real estate  well propertied man he was  but you were aware that russell bell  was regarded as a major narcotic violator  well how do you think he made his money  i didnt inquire  you never got a look at either of the gunmen  i told you i saw only the one of them he was black  big i thought with a large weapon  bnbg  big negro big gun  two more like it upstairs  yeah  have ballistics rush comparisons drugrelateds for the last six months  i caught him bunk  on the wire i caught him  he doesnt fuckinknow it  mission accomplished  boxing yeah  i know you loved that  ugh i hated it i hated watching it  yeah i know you did  so youre doing good huh  day to day i am  cause i was thinking maybe  im proud of you dennis be well  shut that fuckindoor  man fuck it  im ready for this shit  these niggers are snappinon us you see  do you believe this fucking shit  some shit like this woulda never happened with the old barksdale  yo slim man say the motherfuckinword  shit is on  sup b  you aight  we gonna bounce back on the motherfucker no question  bounce back on who  marlo boss oh he gonna fall  marlo marlo aint got shit to do with it  marlo couldnt get string like that  string diedcause of some other shit  what  he died because of some other shit nigger  i couldnt fix it i tried  that nigger string was right about this shit man  that nigger was right  fuck marlo fuck this fucking war  all this beef over a couple of fuckincorners  dont matter who did what to who at this point  fact is we went to war  and now there aint no going back  i mean shit  its what war is you know  once you in it you in it  if its a lie then we fight on that lie  but we gotta fight  got this out of his pocket  i got no idea  its a cell chip from a phone  what elsedid you get off him   president street address  i got landsman banginout a warrant for the place  fuck the politics for a minute  what if the man happens to be right  legalizing drugs  crime is down in his district and  people on that side of town theyre okay with it  look if you dont exist what happens here  if theres no tommy carcetti  in this thing whats likely to happen  the mayor and burrell they shut this thing down  i figure the mayors trying to find a way  to shuit down to make it look like it was an enforcement plan  in case it goes public  otherwise hed have moved to end it already  makes sense but no matter what  colvins little experiment is finished  come on tommy  they dealt you a winning hand  and youre acting like you forgot how to play  mr mayor call it legalization and my office cant live with it  agreed no one can  but harm reduction  that could sell provided theres a reduction in the crime rate  harm reduction sounds good  steven what if we were able to suggest  limiting our street level enforcement  we were concentrating our resources on highlevel traffickers  how would that play  well if i could show off that kind of casework yeah maybe  but theyve been doing street rips for so long now  i dont think a high level exists  what if we were able to say that no major traffickers  were allowed in the free zone  that the major violators were still being targeted huh  are you suggesting some kind of admissions  criteria for the zones how would that work  i dont know that it would  im just saying that for the sake of public perception  come on people work with me on this thing  fucked up aint it  marlo need to get his ass dropped him and all his crew   they gonna fall youll see   all right let me know   thats the word on the wire anyway  every mention puts it on marlo stanfields crew  which means the wars gonna ratchet up no question  wheres jimmy  he went with bunk moreland to rifle stringers spot downtown   howd he take it  like stringer was kin   yeah  bushy top   need to pull your coat up   hey whats up major  i got somethinfor yall mount vernon square in about an hour   im there  this is stringers  yeah  who in fuck was i chasing  whats done is done  gay ass gangsters please  i took it for as long as i could  lets go man  lets go  it being your town i trust you to do it proper  you off today boss  every day at this point  i told em over at comsta about my little experiment  bosses went crazy huh  anyway thats why i called you  that there is a wartime layup for your man barksdale  my sources tell me the mans there  most of the time with a lot of muscle  sawedoffs semiautos mac11s  whole lot of good shit if you hit it right   thats a hell of a tip  shit  that right there might be the last bit of police work  in a long and storied career  ill talk to you bushy top  which one is ali  in the white trunks boy   damn he look young  he was  this the patterson fight right here old school  who patterson he soft  ali whippinhis ass  he was a champ too  look any man still standing at the end of a round  you cant call him soft thats a rule all right  from stringers place downtown  b and b shit college papers real estate stuff  theres no phone extension in the place just these  cell phone chips bout 100 of them  so thats why he wasnt taking any phones  from our man bernard huh  stringer had his own phone  he just changed the number every time he changed the chip  shamrock too probably with whatever phone he used to call bell  cautious man  yes and no  have a look in here all different manufacturers  before stringer bell got aced  he went out of his way to put in his good friend avon barksdale  thats a barksdale safe house  whered you get this  colvin   calls to the western  wheres daniels  hes got this thing downtown its for his wife  you should raise him  its not enough to make up for stringer  itll do for now  because the neighborhoods  and the residents in this district are among  the poorest in our city and it is these residents  who most need a strong voice at city hall  time has come for a change  and i believe i can bring about that change  by providing a strong voice for the new 11th district  if you will do me the honor   its kind of cool the lieutenants wife running for office you know  well as you just heard west baltimore city  council woman eunetta perkins is going to have her hands full  in next septembers democratic finals   stringer bell damn  who could have got to him  i mean if it wasnt yall on it  you know avons gonna put it on you right  shit let him take it on my jacket  dont make me no never mind  im thinkinit might be what you call one of them good problems  yeah  i heard colvins in deep shit downtown  looking at this right here  he might not be the only one  anything comes up im on the radio  my man my man my man yo you think i could get like 5   i need like 5 to get on the bus  i look like a tourist to you   man i swear to god  lookinlike that  walking into an openair drug market  why the hell would i think youll spend my 5  on bus fare  shitcause i already got my blast man  all night you been drinking like your ass is candy  thats shameful shit   last time i saw that kind of load was the pimlico double  and i fuckinknow that motherfucker was in the middle of that mess  and if i remember your boy  he had no love for the barksdale people  execution style that dont play like omar little  besides the word on our wire is that marlos people did stringer   marlo stanfield  the heir apparent  this citys going to hell man  were gonna push past 300 murders before new years  shit is fucked  oh hey cheryl  no my guess is shes uh picking up a prisoner  yeah i spoke to her about ten minutes ago  yeah well they make you check your stuff  cell phone money weapon  well shell call when she gets the message  not at all  i need more jimmy  more  motherfucker  im tired bunk  lets go  i heard the vanguard met  heard they voted to have a civilian review board look at it  it wasnt unanimous and there were people there speaking for you  i heard that too  so six out of ten black officers think im just an asshole racist  on the other hand  four out of ten think youre just an asshole  its an administrative charge you can fight it and win  if you want  failure to properly identify myself as a police officer  sounds like what i was guilty of most of my career actually  im not sure i was supposed to be a police  not really  what were ya supposed to be huh  this is from major colvins ci  whats the corroboration  well the source knew that barksdale had a waterfront condo in his own name  gave the accurate location and title info  down to deed of transfer  well thats good but it puts him on the legitimate side of things  what corroboration is there for illegal activities  sorry im late  i had to stop in at a friend  the source knew that barksdale was shot last month  wounded in the shoulder   emergency room  no no hospital reports  were gonna need better  either colvin goes back to the ci or we sit on this address for a while   we can see  well fuck it then  lets name the source put him right in the affidavit   its colvins call isnt it  its stringer bell  lester figured it out from the dnrs  bell was snitching out barksdale   youre sure of this  maybe that explains the murder  whats in the wire  loose talk about how it was marlos people  but nothing past rumor  with bell gone barksdale might have to come down a notch  to oversee the day to day and maybe that puts him in contact  with some of our monitored cell phones  if hes as cautious as stringer maybe not  my guess is barksdale never touches a cell phone  safe house might be our best shot  all right  we stay on the wires until this batch of burners  goes dead hoping we have barksdale  but meanwhile we get a warrant  for that safe house and wait on him there  thanks for the cover last night  this is greggs major case unit whos the shift leader  holy christ   theyre all over it commissioner   right  that was foxtrot  the cameras have found our little shit pile  your fuckincouncilman took his sweet time didnt he  everyones a critic  if this doesnt go what line of work are you gonna try next  were here in west baltimore  for more than a month police from baltimores western district  its just an outrageous development  its something i never thought id see from this or any other administration  frankly this is one of the reasons we need a change  in leadership in this city  did the mayor know what about the police commissioner  these are questions for the mayor and police commissioner  these are central issues of crime and safety  the royce administration is simply bankrupt  you still gonna announce for mayor next month  standing here today looking at this  i cant see i can do anything but put it out there right now  all i can tell you is that for more than four weeks now  the baltimore police department surrendered  portions of the police district to the drug trade  and the council was not informed  fuck me i fuckin had this story all to myself a week ago  police officers for weeks have turned a blind eye   what the fuck was i thinking   sanctioning openair drug markets   scuse us   in the so called free zones drug dealers routinely ply   mr mayor commissioner burrell is here  tell the commissioner the mayor will be with him shortly  and young children run the streets alone   the inhabitants of what has come to be known  as hampsterdam have little to say for the camera   but channel 5 has learned that the police were   yeah  what are you seein  coupla people in and out no sign of barksdale though  its quiet here too   okay  need to look at the back  our friend carcettis gonna run wild with this  and from the sound of things gray is gonna run with him  tony gray thinks hes gonna get my chair behind this bullshit  were throwinyou out of the boat ervin  this shit is on you alone  not necessarily  not if i talk about how we were under pressure  to keep the crime down  to juke the stats district by district  you never said that  about how colvin under pressure lost his way  about how i came to you weeks ago   days ago  weeks ago  to tell you what he had done and to assure you that  we were on top of the situation  that colvin would be relieved and his plan aborted  you lyinmotherfucker  but you heard about the drop in colvins felony rate  and you sent me packing  brought in your liberalass dogooders to seriously consider  this horseshit  while colvins mistake grew and grew  my hands were tied mr mayor  my department thwarted  i was a prisoner of the goddamn politicians  or  i leave your office right now willing to say a lot less than that  i put what i can on crazyass bunny colvin  and i take the hit

most of his muscle yeah  good day to get back out on them corners aint it  make some money  you bet  its not just the 17 millions in federal funding  for baltimore law enforcement that youve jeopardized  take off another 200 million of federal money in your operating budget  another 75 in capital expenditures  plus untold millions in passthrough federal dollars from annapolis  all told were talking about  half a billion a year that baltimore will be doing without  furthermore the us attorney here will use all the resources  of the justice department to interdict and destroy  any attempt to establish  a geographic entity where drugs are legal  washington should know that what happened in west baltimore  in no way reflects the policies of my administration  that was an aberration mr talmadge  the work of one misguided police official  we understand your concerns  but for the deputy drug czar  to take the time out to drive 30 miles north  to deliver that message hardly necessary  rest assured  what up g  where the older ones at  marlo got his package back out  fire burrell this nonsense began in his shop  without him knowing it fire the man and move on  odell i respect your opinion  but right now  tony gray carcetti maneuvering  now is not the time  we get past the primary then ill drive a stake in his heart  but right now i need him where he is  for no other reason than to  well to take the hit for this thing right here  but i tell you what im gonna do though  im gonna shine on that new girl you like in the 11th  give her a spot on the ticket cut eunetta loose  eunettas had her day  i respect the fact that you stood by me odell  i respect loyalty  and did so without properly informing his superior officers  and without regard to the criminal statutes he was sworn to enforce  thereby disgracing himself and his command  is any of that subject to any contradiction  or argument whatsoever major colvin  no sir  no argument at all bunny  not much you can say is there  not to real police   get on with itmotherfu  scuse me major  is the admin lieutenant present  major colvin is relieved of duty  you are now the acting commander of the western district   hey bunk  hey freamon   who is that crutchfield   naw norris  sleeping on a stakeout  damn bernard didnt i tell you about these guys  yeah thats everyone we heard on the wire  mcnultys over there in number one with pearlman  why dont you say hey  you got to be the stupidest motherfucker  that ive ever gone out with  i cant wait to go to jail  what what you say  what the fuck did you say bernard  hey donald   you heard the tapes  look he came to me  and said we could sell drugs if we move down to vincent street  and thats where i moved my crew  and you know i did because you the one that popped me with the gpack  on my way to the spot and let me go remember  you were selling drugs in major colvins free zone   you can prove that  ask him he know  this must be one of them contrapment things  you mean entrapment  kids got a point  from barksdale on down  another eight wanted on warrants  any way you can tie your case to this mess with colvin  make it like what he was doing led to your thing  i dont see it  well its good work nonetheless major daniels  call came in from the mayors office  half hour ago approving your promotion  and now with colvin theres a new vacancy   what about my wife  what about her  the mayor eunettas seat   why would the mayor  good police work maybe  not everything is politics  hey ill take two western alumni  all right you got it  major  i heard  hows your family take it  lolita done dropped herself  a real estate license  so i guess shes fixinto leave me  i just wanted you to know that last tip you gave me  was a winner  yeah i heard  thats good work  also i dont know if you know stringer bell was shot to death  two days ago  so anyway i put his name on the paper  to tighten the pc  i figured what the fuck once hes aced right  you always did cut them corners didnt you  seems like you cut a few yourself major  however it ends youre good police  i just did what i did  it felt right  im fine with that  i dont understand  drink your wine  you and me in public   but your wife  she wins without me  on the mayors ticket she wins  and you make major  i think she was waiting for this day more than i ever was  and now shes not here  no  shes not  from out of nowhere huh  nowhere is right  why me  i guess you dont live right   kari what was that  nothing   what broke  nothing mama  so  yeah  you just drive over here  i did  why tonight what happened  i was in my old district tonight  which is where i used to feel pretty good i think  i wasnt so angry when i was there anyway  i dont know someone said something i guess  and uhit doesnt make sense  i guess i finished something today  a case  more than that  its like everything i poured into a glass  came out the bottom  and i just kept on pouring  like the thing had a hole in it you know  things that make me right for this job  maybe theyre the same things that make me wrong  for everything else  do you want to come inside for a drink  not tonight  but if its not too late i wouldnt mind  meeting your kids  major colvin misled his officers  they thought that his initiative was a tactical deployment  to entrap narcotics traffickers  there was no mention whatsoever  of the initiative to any superior officer  and for five weeks all evidence  of what he was doing managed to elude the entire command staff  are you kidding commissioner  i take full responsibility  and indeed after i first learned of the matter  i informed the mayor and together  we moved immediately  to relieve major colvin  im under the impression that  this administration gave serious consideration  with colvins initiative  no sir  major colvin informed you of his effort at a comstat meeting  more than a week ago  his free zones stayed up for six days after that  thats my responsibility councilman  we needed the time to conclude an ongoing investigation  by the major crime unit a wiretap case  that would have been disrupted  correct mayor royce was aware of the pending case  and allowed us to delay our response accordingly  but the mayor was unequivocal  in his opposition to what major colvin did  what we have here im afraid is nothing more complicated  than a solitary police commander who under great pressure  proved to be amoral incompetent and unfit for command  no  its about more than that  this is more important than who knew what when  or who falls on his sword  or whether someone can use this disaster  to make a political point or two  mr chairman  we can forgive major colvin who out of his frustration  and despair found himself condoning something which  cant possibly be condoned we can do that much  but gentlemen what we cant forgive  what i cant forgive ever  is how we  you me this administration all of us  how we turned away from those streets in west baltimore the poor the sick  the swollen underclass of our city trapped in the wreckage of neighborhoods  which were once so prized communities which  weve failed to defend which we have surrendered  to the horrors of the drug trade  and if this disaster demands anything of us as a city  it demands that we say enough  enough to the despair which makes policemen even think about surrender  enough to the fact that these neighborhoods are not saved  or are beyond the saving enough to this administrations  indecisiveness and lethargy  to the garbage which goes uncollected  the lots and row houses which stay vacant  the addicts who go untreated  the working men and women who every day  are denied a chance at economic freedom  enough to the crime which every day  chokes more and more of the life from our city  and  the thing of it is if we dont take responsibility and step up  not just for the mistakes and the miscues  but for whether or not were gonna win this battle for our streets  if that doesnt happen  were gonna lose these neighborhoods and ultimately this city forever  if we dont have the courage  and the conviction to fight this war they way it should be fought  the way it needs to be fought using every weapon  that we can possibly muster if that doesnt happen  well then were staring at defeat  and that defeat should not and cannot  and will not be forgiven  it was a good case  im not denying that  but i need to trust my people  unless you can give your word theres no way  thats more than fair  thanks  but its better for me if i do something else  detective  its not you its me   but where  the western i think  western feels like home  you showed something today  just felt like it needed to be said  sounds like youre
