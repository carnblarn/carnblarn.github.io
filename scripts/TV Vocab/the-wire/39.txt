                i thought he was supposed to have a breakfast date right  i mean they told me that last night  breakfast is that on the schedge  it isnt but the lieutenant told me  that hed be doing breakfast  with someone down at the harbor  i mean if he aint  i could go get this gassed up at the fallsway  i hate this detail man  its off duty lotsa perks  all this stand around and wait  you know

working western drugs  all right fuck this  im gonna go look for the lieutenant  anyone comes looking  im back up on the second floor  sir  i understood that the mayor might be going to uh  breakfast

shouldve run every one of these subpoenas by my front office  thats not procedure  fuck procedure lester  my boss is running 2 points behind in the polls with the mayors support  how do you think hes gonna do if he pisses off royce  and starts dropping off incumbent tickets  why do you care  if demper thinks i fucked him and he wins  i will be at central booking covering bail reviews  if he loses

subpoenas  we are  clay davis and andy krawczyk  im holding those til october  oh the hell you are  lester we drop subpoenas on either of those guys   and all hell breaks loose  thats what im sayin  clay davis is royces deputy campaign chairman  and the number 2 man at the city legislative caucus  and krawczyk is his number 1 fundraiser  youre giving me resumes and job titles  im just following the money  and we will follow it after the polls close  we can drop a second batch of subpoenas  there is no reason to do this now and risk  a year ago  if we had gone after these records  city hall wouldve stomped on  this unit and the subpoenas  and a month from now after royce is reelected  theyll do us the same way  but right now  with the primary coming  they gotta worry about how they look

comes at me with race and some bullshit crime stats  i ignore the race thing and counter by noting  that homicides are up 15  even though other violent crime stats are down 12  i point out this does not make sense  unless royce is cooking the crime stats  making robberies rapes and assaults disappear  i suggest the mayor is not telling the truth about crime in the city  i conclude by declaring that it is for all of baltimore  every neighborhood  that im making public safety the cornerstone of my campaign  tomorrow night i will kick his ass  but the next morning  i still wake up white in a

witness  trust me we do not wanna kick shit in an election year  work the case take the ot  but bury the witness angle til we know for sure  and close the door  yeah  its landsman homicide  is the major in this morning  next order of business class rules  it helps if the team is constant on these  less giggle room for the children  mrs scott  same as last year double space  language arts we grade a lot of papers  it doesnt make them write any better but it saves my eyesight  make sure you demonstrate it for them  some of them think double space means more space between words  id of thought by eighth grade  rule of thumb around here mr pryzbylewski  never assume  explain what you want them to do  have them do it then explain again  with time and patience theyll get it  mrs shapiro  its easier to keep track of lab work if we all use the same heading  upper right hand corner above the first blue line  name date and class number in that order  mr pryzbylewski do you have anything you want addressed  can we have them not chew gum  they wont do it in ms sampsons class  but in 4 years i have not been able to stop them  you can try but first year its best to stick with basics  and team rules we can only go with what we can all enforce  also keep your windows closed  makes them drowsy and drowsys good  theres a lot to learn but for now  build in lots of activities in your lesson plan  you cant have enough  you keep them busy you keep them off guard  you need soft eyes  excuse me  yeah but that doesnt prevent you  from giving more under your wifes name  your children if they got separate accounts yeah  sorry richie can you hold a moment  your buddy from the fop and he says its important  hey stan  im a little busy losing an election here  you remember

thats for duquan right  i take it to him  gimme  hey crystal  miss donnelly said to give you these  ok ill be right down  what  and for either of my opponents to suggest  that downtown development comes at the expense  of our citys neighborhoods  well thats just unfair and uh divisive  for them to suggest that my administration  has not been responsive well  economic development cannot be a bandaid  it is a longterm process that requires commitment  to retraining our workforce and as i said before  this can only be successful in a city where people feel safe  so before we can even begin to think about  luring new industries to baltimore  we need to think about how we can make  these neighborhoods and this city safe once again  mr carcetti may think its in his interest  to exploit peoples fears  hes been doing it throughout this campaign  im offended by it personally  but the fact is  that violent crime is down citywide  and our police department is working hard  to keep it that way  and will continue to do so under my administration  councilman carcetti  you have 2 minutes to respond  does anyone in this room really believe that crime is down in baltimore  you calling me a liar tommy  gentleman please no personal interactions  councilman carcetti  can the mayor honestly tell  the people of rosemont  of belair edison of highlandtown or cherry hill  theres less drugdealing less violence  any statistics coming from the police department  cannot be trusted because under this mayor  the police are more concerned with protecting clarence royce politically  than fighting crime  theres no leadership and morale has never been lower  ill change that  its business as usual down at city hall  and as a result our response to crime  has been characterized time and time again  by wanton indifference  32 yards  what do i mean by business as usual  what do i mean by wanton indifference  well last night in west baltimore  on lanvale street  another citizen was shot and killed  this time the victim was a key witness  in a drug case that had yet to come to court  courageously this man had agreed to testify  in 2 weeks time in that case  the police should have been protecting him  they were not and he was murdered   oh shit  why  youre primetime eddie  would not spend the money to protect him  now i have no doubt that in a moment or two  clarence royce will accuse me of exploiting  this mans death for my own political purpose  but the truth is  a year ago  i wrote the mayor a letter  i have copies for anyone who wants one  i begged him to spend the money and make witness protection a priority  he ignored me  i even teamed up with our legislative leaders  delegate watkins and others  to get matching funds for witness protection approved in annapolis  and incredibly those matching funds  were never claimed by this administration  now to mention this now may be exploitive  i dont know i only know its true  and on such truths  i ask the voters of our city to consider a change  folks please please  hold your applause until after the round of questions is over  mayor royce  no more surprises huh  well i am unaware of the specifics of the incident  to which councilman carcetti is referring  uh so i cant answer that directly  however i can say that this city  places the highest priority on protecting those citizens  who come forward to testify  and we will continue to do so  mr carcetti states that he wrote a letter  expressing his concerns and im sure that he did  i mean its its  its easy enough to write letters  when all you have to do is write letters  but when you are required  to run a city  on limited resources  and balance priorities  well then well then you understand  that writing letters will not solve the problem  oh no  shit girl  you know ima roll wit you  i need some kinda break  oh shit  aint nothin worse than them bitches  with fucked up nails at the blackjack table  you know  hold on  you think my son aint gonna go up to that school lookin like himself  and i dont believe we can get a handle on crime  until we get a handle on the schools  because we need to be thinking about these kids  before the corners take them  and this means a renewed focus on our schools  the wired team  thewirefrancecom
