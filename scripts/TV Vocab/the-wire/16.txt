fuck that shit zig seriously   what are you gonna do  ill think of something   were looking for 14580 by the manifest  cant be the numbers dont go that high  you had to figure itd be this way the way the port works  yeah  why have anything other than fake companies  and addresses on the manifest if youre moving a can with contraband  and on the other end too right  you can work it back through customs but chances are  this box wasnt picked up anywhere near this rue de rivoli address  in le havre france  hell there might not even be a rue de rivoli in that town  a can full of dead girls sent to nowhere from nowhere   he been good business for me though  yeah  two three quarters a week  mr tilghmans money always right always on time  thats why we coming to you for the setup   you the man to him  im just saying  i know the money and you know we gonna find a way to make that right  but like i said im not asking for myself  now im asking for my man   avons call  wouldnt be here otherwise   avon is avon  always  he probably gonna roll past tomorrow  thatll work  you see what im saying right  it makes no sense to bring the girls all this way and then kill them  you go all that way to dump it on your boss and now youre worrying yourself   its got me thinking is all  its a little late for that mcnulty  what connects the one girl in the water with all the other ones in the can   if youre right and she isnt local then  shes definitely not local  the low level of mercury viscosity  in the amalgam restorations says eastern europe   if you say so  trust me shes not from dundalk  eastern europe can you narrow it down some  hows this three of the dead girls were in budapest hungary sometime last year  howd you know that  they bought tits there  three of the girls had breast enhancements we looked at the bags during the post  we pulled the lot and serial numbers  and they trace back to an outpatient plastic surgery clinic in budapest  would you call them might pull an id from patient records  the best they could tell me is the implants were used some time this fall  three girls three surgeries same clinic right   what else  what else   fuck you jimmy mcnulty  okay youre a fucking god  theres no one in the game who can stand in your light dr frazier sir  you have to admit that whole budapest thing was a hell of a pull   wheres the paperwork on this cat  i got it over here  so go on what else  not much except the swabs show that at least seven of the girls in the box  had vaginal intercourse within 24 hours of death  two had anal and six came back positive on the oral  you tell cole about all this  i sent the findings off to homicide but cole aint on the case brother   no who is  its your man bunk  and that older guy his partner they ate it  thanks  i told you i brought you a soda  that better  now look at me dont let those mean boys see you crying   okay  okay  ill take care of you  mr stump  them boys been teasing chantelle again  you know it   morning  morning   bobby how you been  not bad   working the tier today  yeah on j   have a good one  yeah you too  you happy now bitch  how was i gonna know landsman would pull cole  and stick you guys  you right here with them   what did he call cole  collateral damage  im feeling pretty damn collateral myself i got to say  which is why i went to see dr frazier and work some things out in my head  officer mcnulty couldve paid this thing no mind but no  when his friends are suffering he bleeds too  did you see the preliminary  positives for oral vaginal anal  no ids no passports no visas no real money  and theyre coming across the water like that   yeah  mcnulty has a theory   does he now  you deductive motherfucker you  so hes gonna wander in here with some johnnycomelately bullshit  about how these girls are all coming over here as prostitutes  talking about how if they aint got the cash to travel better than a container ship  then they sure dont have the money for a plastic surgeon  then hes gonna say something about that one in the water  being tossed off the ship after shes already dead from a beatdown  but why she got beat hes gonna ask us that like we dont know  hes gonna answer his own question saying her swabs are negative right  fuck or fight with all them sailor boys and she fought  so it got a little rough  she gets banged around she comes up dead  and then somebody panics tosses her in the harbor overnight  before the ship ties up  but the other girls saw  so now the other girls they get told to get back in that can  and our man to cover this shit up  he gets up on top and bangs down the air pipe   anything else you want to tell us  when did you guys get there  yesterday when the ships first mate told us that while the ship was at sea  half the crew came to him for advances on their salary  they had one hell of a dice game going on below deck  or the boys popped them girls out of that can  you talk to the crew   in what language  crime scene   nope  anybody missing  two guys jumped ship one in philly one in norfolk  but that shit happens all the time apparently   got yourself a hell of a case  fuck you very much  you know what happens to all the girls if you dont id them  anatomy board as medical cadavers then a crematorium  then that mass grave out at crownsville  that bothers you  yeah a little  me too   thanks for hosting this father  hope it helps  you guys have really done the background on this  this is more presence than the port unions have shown in years   is the governor listening  its now or never for us  and not just the grain pier but with the dredging  i dont care what the corps of engineers study says   the fact remains  excuse me bobby  i just need him to work the other side of the room on something  youre wasting time here  bobbys district 7 which is middle river  which means every vote he gets is somebody with some port connection  hes a good vote no matter what we do  the guys you need to be working are the guys  who wouldnt have come if we hadnt been throwing money at them   like who  like john carney from anne arundel  liz tobin from montgomery clay davis from over westside  keep hold of them some of your stuff stays in the budgets   and theyre with us  carney is pretty firm  liz will stay solid if the environmentalists dont get to her  clay davis that guy you wanna make sure youre the last man out of the room  what do you mean  i mean weve given forty large to the westside democratic organization  and this motherfucker still has his hand out  we spent 40000 on that guy  worth it if he lets your projects sail through the conference committee   forty fuckin thousand  am i your lobbyist are you paying me  trust me with the players in this room  the presiding officers and a little help from the governors office  we might squeeze some things out this session  now go make nice   senator davis  excuse me  hey partner  people tell me it just might be a good year for the port  might be  you all have been stepping up in a lot of ways  hope it continues like that you all making friends in a lot of places  were friendly guys  so they came back murders  i admit i didnt see that coming at all  who couldve seen that  for whoever was having these girls brought over   the net loss is in the millions  that much  one of these girls on the circuit going clubtoclub on the east coast  can bring in half a million over the next two years  and thats just for club work and prostitution   so somebody messed up  in a big way  you guys called it no such address in le havre  or for that matter anywhere in brittany  the name and id of the driver who signed the bill of lading  doesnt correspond to their motor vehicle database  dead ends either way  the girls they know what theyre coming over for  some do  some get told theyre gonna dance or be secretaries  you gotta understand theyre coming from places that dont have much  romania moldavia russia albania  working in the us alone   they need a whole new agency just to police them  what they need is a union   to stan and kate  stan and kate  happy anniversary  thanks a lot   good time here  yeah  how is my detail coming
