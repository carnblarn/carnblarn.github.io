look at your numbers i see the intel reports the photos  it all tells me that you lack a fucking clue  if youll permit me  is your deputy major present  yes sir  you now command the eastern district  major taylor you are relieved  take the podium  anyone else having trouble with the writing on the wall  dismissed  dead soldiers  and im like nigger if you want to sell me a new car  you better

pursuit and rest of aforementioned suspect  he was caught eastside right  but the wagon made a stop at the western district  for an unscheduled tuneup  its dark on that backlot  western boys mistook him for a pinata  so what do you think  i think this is a tragic motherfuckin miscarriage of justice  i think it deserves a special grand jury  and if not the president should appoint  an independent prosecutor  oh no no no actually  i think kofi bryant an the united fucking nations  should get involved  its a murder bunk  the word from upstairs is that we supposed to be havin  less murders not

street  you know as a principle  the great white deputy has spoken  this case is not down until the gun comes home  fine dont get up  one of the most heavily armed cities in the gunloving world  why

thats not the case  major colvin  i am under the impression crime is down in the western  perhaps you misfigured your felony stats this week  no sir  we were very accurate  sometimes the gods are  uncooperative  uncooperative  this is a cooperative effort a cooperative department  why in the eastern district  lieutenant daniels exemplified this new spirit just the other day  and because of that

of that muff  and delivers my fucking stat sheets  with a reduction that matches just what we promised the mayor  that would be beautiful  that would be creme fucking brulee  but what i got instead is some halfassed  iwishweweredoingbetter platitude thats  meant to fool maybe  a sixyearold girl into thinking youre doing your job  well shes left the room major colvin  shes out there right now asking the stripper  if she can have her job when she grows up  because she sure as shit doesnt want yours  you know why  because there isnt gonna be a goddamn western district  in 20 years if this shit
