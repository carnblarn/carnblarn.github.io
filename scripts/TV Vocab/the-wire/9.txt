old are you young at heart  walon man  bubs  give them a long rope  the farther away from the projects you pop him the less risk to the wire  hell with the wire  excuse me  gotcha mcnulty youre too easy  you can come at this a few ways  first thing is we need the names of all front companies  iimited partnerships llcs and all that mess  llcs limited liability corporations  start with the nightclub which barksdale owns  look up orlandos by address you match it and you see its owned by who  its on baltimore street right  got it d  b enterprises  give it to prez whos going to get off his ass  and walk on over to the state office buildings on preston street  preston street corporate charter office  corporate who  they have the paperwork on every corporation and llc  iicensed to do business in the state  you look up d  b enterprises on the computer  youre going to get a little reel of microfilm  pull the corporate charter papers that way  write down every name you see  corporate officers shareholders or more importantly  the resident agent on the filing who is usually a lawyer  while they use front names you know as corporate officers  theyll usually use the same lawyer to do the charter filing  find that agents name run it through the computer  find out what other corporations hes done the filing for  and that way we find other front companies  while hes doing that what do i do  youre gonna to keep your head in this assessment book  look up any properties that you can connect to barksdale  how do you know it connects to barksdale right  you work off of what prez gets you from the corporate charter documents  whatever companies he links to barksdale or people connected to him  you look for those companies in the city land records  for example mcnulty said that he heard that barksdale  owned an apartment building up on druid park lake  you look up all the blocks on reservoir hill  see if theres anything owned by d  b enterprises  or any other company that prez finds  through corporate charter or anything similar  ifyou find something that fits you write down the folio number  so that you can look it up later at the courthouse  you dont find anything  just take the names of all the corporate listings for the multiunits near the lake  you call that list over to prez who pulls the charter papers  and hell look for connections  its like a scavenger hunt but what if barksdale is careful  i mean what if we cant find his name on anything  in this country  somebodys name has got to be on a piece of paper  a cousin a girlfriend a grandmother a lieutenant he can trust  somebodys name is on a piece of paper  and heres the rub  you follow drugs  you get drug addicts and drug dealers  but you start to follow the money  and you dont know where the fuck its going to take you  while were running around on this what are you going to do  you need something yeah  let me get the  campaign financial reports for the western districts  and actually any citywide race  you want quarterly reports or individual donor lists  both please itll be a couple hundred pages  really ill take all of it  what the fuck man  with your right hand reach for the window open the

howard street corridor  what kind of property lowrent commercials  a lot of vacants  the fuck does avon barksdale want with a string of empty storefronts  this feels premature what does  chasing up
