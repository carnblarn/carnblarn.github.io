late  she didnt talk long she said she had to go dee was at the door  and that was the last time you spoke with her  yeah she was killed that night dee was her boyfriend  no dee was his nephew or something  dee would be dangelo barksdale  and the boyfriend avon barksdale  and the boyfriend avon barksdale  you know avon  the question is how do you know him  you out there running the street with the players  i used to be  but not after this thing with diedre i mean damn  we used to go to odells for ladies nights  and one time he was there with all his people in one of the big booths  ordering drinks acting like he was king of everything  and diedre ate that shit up  and you i aint gonna lie  i did the club thing for a while but  some of those places everybody in theres on some kind of game  but diedre went with avon  she was with avon for like a year  and something happened toward the end she started getting real possessive  and that didnt sit with avon cause he has other girls too  she started bitching on him one minute  crying the next minute threatening to do all kinds of things  she threatened avon barksdale the girl was off the hook  one time she threatened to write a letter on him  a letter a letter to the states attorney  supposed to be some sort of kin to her  she said that if he dumped her  she was gonna tell about the drugs  did she write this letter i dont know  i tried talking to her about the way she was acting but she wouldnt let it go  she even had it out with him in his club one night in front of all the people  what avon has a club  orlandos titty bar  does he own it thats what diedre said  she said he owned a whole mess of stuff  tell me something man whats that  how can you run this place and not just od on pussy  shit  you try dealing with all

she knew from what he bragged about to the dead girl  major likes assets the deputy too i imagine  nothing like a few property forfeitures to swell the departmental operation budget  check city assessments to see who owns the club  run the company name through the state corporate charter office  also homicide picked up one saturday night might be one of ours  john bailey hes a stickup artist i used to know from the murphy homes  he was wearing kevlar but it didnt help  from three different guns  overkill for a burn bag  but about right if he was running with omar  lookit our buddy  just once i wish theyd use the right number  aint like him to be late  bailey you fucking dope fiend im telling you  them fucking people aint to be relied on  why you always gotta talk like that man  what f this and f that  if i give it up i lose half of what i mean to say  dont nobody want to hear them dirty words man  especially coming from such a beautiful mouth  wait for bailey  early bird catches the worm dog  i beeped you i didnt get it  let me see you want to see my pager  sure prez you want to see my pager  i beeped you too you all right prez   i got that that was you  you try it  yeah i tried it twice  nonworking number  it wouldve worked if you knew the code  shit im as surprised as you  i like wordsearch puzzles  you know where you gotta find the hidden words  so i thought i could do the same thing with the numbers  take the number i sent you  now take the seven and jump it over the five  you get three  jump the one over the five  you get nine  with four you get six  three thats seven four is six  a three again  and two is eight  zero switches with the five  so 7143432 is   our number  and thats the code  and it works because its all about where the buttons are on a phone  if it was a code that involved math  or algebra or whatever  these little yos in the projects wouldnt be able to follow along  but with this all you gotta do is jump the five button  aint no math to it its just  how a phone looks when you look at it  prez you little genius  jesus i could kill you thats so good  your mother keep ragging at me  to take him outta here and put him in a private nursing home  you know she aint never gonna let that go  i keep telling her man we cant show this legit money yet man  especially since he aint got no insurance  soon though  so you aint big
