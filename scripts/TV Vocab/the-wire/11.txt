mean im willing to let you little ratfuckers suborn perjury  blow smoke up a judges ass and jurytamper your balls off  without losing the slightest bit of my sunny disposition  fuck me if i dont let you structure your cash into briefcase fees either  thats between you and the irs neither one of you is anyones friend right  what jimmy is trying to say is  no what jimmy is saying is if you want my nose closed to your shit  you have to throw me something when i need it  and right now i need savino bratton in bracelets  i dont know where he is  you repped him the last four felonies  i guess you can get word to him if you want to  a police may die morrie and savino was there  he comes in this afternoon  and he takes the drug charge at least  or what  or we send tactical teams into his mommas house every night  until theres no house left to worry about  you get a target letter from the states attorneys office  followed by subpoenas for every bank account  in your fucking name  and lets see if all those cash deposits match the reported income  im hearing this from him  and i understand that hes distraught i understand that  am i hearing this from the states attorneys office as well  you are  ill see what i can do  fuck you jimmy  you didnt tell me that was coming hell bring him in  he will if he can thats not the point whats the point  the point is that morrie levy is a past officer of the monumental bar association  and unless i want to spend my whole life as a fucking asa  i cant spend my afternoons pissing on people who matter  another career in the balance  fuck you no fuck you  if only half of you in the states attorneys office  didnt want to be judges  didnt want to be partners in a downtown law firm  if you had the balls to follow through you know what would happen  a guy like that would be indicted tried and convicted  the rest of them would back up  so we could push a clean case through your courthouse  but no everybody stays friends everybody gets paid  and everybodys got a fucking future  youll just use anyone wont you  ive been searching the logs for pager hits that used an 07 code right  it comes up now and then on dangelos pager  stringers too but less often  most of the time theres nothing to place the guy  but check it  and this is on stringers page it comes back to the pay phone  in the emergency room at maryland general hospital  let me guess  the date of this page is the same day that stinkum got killed  and weebey got shot in the leg  that was the talk on the wire anyway  if you go to maryland general and pull the er records for that morning  youre gonna find weebey in the pile   its gotta be  and we have weebey and little man at the pay phone at park heights   throwing a page to stringer  were all over town for this pieceofshit savino  with ties to the barksdale organization  yes sir what else  the case is progressing  were gleaning possible shooters from the wiretap  i asked for the controlled buy  i put one of our people in harms way  so right now i want to make sure that we are doing everything  we are sir were on it good  the commissioner wants raids citywide  every door we can take  any addresses we can write on anything connected to a narcotics case  cid tactical the deus  and tomorrow on the 600 news  we put a lot of fucking dope on the table  a lot of it  dope on the table  we need to let them know who we are  we cant for one minute let them think that this will stand  the commissioner wants to send a message lieutenant  you make sure you and your people  do everything possible to see that it is heard  dope on the damn table  its like the man said  were letting them know who we are  yeah  and who the hell are we  again for the record lets make clear that mr bratton has not been mirandized  and that what is said here is for purposes of a proffer  agreed agreed  okay then  here you go  thats baking soda  which mr bratton intended to sell to orlando blocker  you can keep it with our compliments  wheres the money  mr bratton did not receive money  he left it in the car when he went to retrieve the sham cocaine  if you were recording the transaction the tape will confirm this  and he wasnt around for the shooting either  he doesnt know who the shooters are  and god knows he wasnt in on the setup  i mean it was pure dumb luck  that he left them in an deadend alley and they were shot  just two minutes later  this is bullshit  a police is down  mr bratton had no knowledge that the young woman was a police officer  and no intention of doing anything other than defrauding mr blocker of 30000  ms nathan  no charge if he gives us the shooters  and if he testifies  well find a way to squeeze him into the federal witness program  as i indicated  mr bratton has no idea who shot mr blocker  or the undercover officer  best you can do is 286b  what the hell is that  distribution of sham cds  threeyear maximum 5000 fine  thats it  if he took the cash we could go to felony theft or fraud  but the tape has him leaving the money  three years  a cop was shot morrie  so if we convict hell do every damn day of the three  i can do the three aint no thing  and the 5000 fine  shit you still up 25000 right  nicely done  give me two  damn orlando  i still cant believe that shit  man all this shit behind this motherfucker  who the fuck was he  he ran a club for my uncle yeah  yeah first stink and now him  yeah man and i heard the cops been all in savinos shit too  he aint been around little man neither  somebody could get to cleaning up shit around here  true

departmental response is gonna be to take doors tomorrow morning  citywide  every unit every district is kicking in  any drugconnected address they can write on  were gonna do the same  lieutenant is that except  were gonna hold back on the main stash  the house up in northwest we tracked off the wire  we advance this case more by sitting on that location  and raids that are too much on the bullseye  will have barksdale changing up  we might blow the wire altogether  we got two addresses in the lowrises that are probables  and another two row houses  that have been used for stash as recently as last week  but this  this here is the best bet for a good rip  herc picked up on it yesterday  fourthfloor  end unit on the south side of the 221   theyre dropping the reups out the window
