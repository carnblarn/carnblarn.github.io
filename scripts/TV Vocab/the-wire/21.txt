customers okay  pour it   you aint getting behind the wheel right  theres a cab picking me up  im looking you in the eye gus im telling you im not driving a car tonight  bite me  yeah coffee   whats

you after what he did  id truck his ass if it was me  hes built kind of solid though  maui aint all that its the clothes that give him size zig   you think  his ass is candy zig  you youre the legend of the docks  truck him with your best punch and then just walk the fuck away  officially ive put us on the hook for 14 open homicides  so either we bring in a hell of a case  or im as big a fool as col rawls thinks i am  that sounded a little desperate  not entirely  lester enlighten miss pearlman as to the status of our investigation  you said this case needed a drug connect for a wiretap right  come take a look at this  thats the dnr log on the phone listed to the warehouse  where we tracked the suspect container  it shows outgoing calls to numbers that connect to petey dixon  proposition joe stewart and white mike mcardle  among other traffickers on the east side  which supports surveillance of known dealers coming and leaving the warehouse  also some surveillance shots and matching mug shot photos  from southeast deu which tie white mike to street dealers  that weve already made controlled buys from  assuming exhaustion thats one tap on the warehouse phone   whats your pc on the truck driver  sergei malatov  resident alien ukrainian origin no criminal history here  we idd him from the contract on the dac truck rental  he was nice enough to give the truck rental people his cell number  and phone records show a call placed to the warehouse  at the time kima observed him on the docks using the cellphone  checking the dnr logs history  we matched seven other calls from that cellphone  to dates and times when a container disappeared from a talco ship  anything else tap 2 feels a bit thin  how about nicholas sobotka of the 1400th block on reynolds street  on a cis information herc and carver followed him  from a drug meet along the fayette street strip  back to his parents south baltimore row home  when we ran that phone number from that address  through the dnr at our warehouse we got nothing  but when we checked it against the cellphone of our friend sergei   we got a couple of hits  sobotkas your stated target right  this is a nephew and from the look of it  hes involved in street dealing as much as smuggling  but right now this case feels like a lot more than frank sobotka   no offense to stan valchek  okay  i admit youve got pc  on the warehouse phone and on the truckers cellphone too  now what have you got for exhaustion  any possible informants   nothing on the docks  no one we can buy weight with   surveillance  that got us to the front door  but its not gonna get us inside that warehouse  start typing ill call the judge  ham and cheese sandwich and one of them frappuccino drinks   i hear charles lost his leg  what  frappuccino what

of the case right here  three apartments on the sixth floor all leased out to pyramid inc  the same people who own the drug warehouse  is this where the girls are staying or something more  no the buildings too nice for room and board  a building this nice is for the johns   makes them feel safer  how do they bring them in the lobby   garage probably  either they have a garage card  or theyre
