the thing  six months from now  im gone  i put in my 30  and the only thing thatll be left of me on that job is an  eightbyeleven framed picture in the western hallway  but you know what  the shit out there  the city  is worse than when i first came on  so what does that say about me  about my life  aw cmon man youre talking about drugs  thats a force of nature  thats sweeping leaves on a windy day whoever the hell you are  you fought the good fight  not a call since we gave it up to cheese  what did you expect  attention   be seated  regarding officer dozerman  his condition has been upgraded to guarded  till he can receive visits  hes beemoved to the recovery unit  as of this tour  all handtohand undercover buys of cds  are suspended in the western district  somewheres  back in the dawn of time  this district had itself a civic dilemma  of epic proportions  the city council had just passed a law  that forbid alcoholic consumption in public places  on the streets  and on the corners  but the corner is and it was and it always will be  the poor mans lounge  its where a man wants to be on a hot summers night  its cheaper than a bar  catch a nice breeze watch the girls go by  but the laws the law  and the western cops rollin by  what were they gonna do  if they arrested every dude out there for tipping back a high life  thered be no other time for any other kind of police work  and if they looked the other way  theyd open themselves to all kinds of flaunting  all kinds of disrespect  now this is before my time when it happened but  somewheres back in the 50s or 60s  there was a small moment of  goddamn genius by some nameless smokehound  who comes out the cutrate one day  and on his way to the corner  he slips that justbought pint of elderberry  into a paper bag  a great moment of civic compromise  that small wrinkledass paper bag  allowed the corner boys to have their drink in peace  and gave us permission  to go and do police work  the kind of police work thats actually worth the effort  thats worth actually taking a bullet for  dozerman  he got shot last night trying to buy  three vials  three  theres never been a paper bag  for drugs  until now  if we aint doing handtohands then what the fuck  and that shit with the bag  what the fuck is that  soustitres par la wired team
