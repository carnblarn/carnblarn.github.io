reiterate this is a polygraph examination  nonadmissible and the answers to all questions  are regarded as a proffer with a limited grant of immunity  agreed  ok to begin please answer yes to a series of questions  regardless of whether or not that answer is correct  is your name anthony wardell  yeah  and youre from baltimore maryland  right now im over at city jail but im from east side  so your answer is  yeah im from baltimore  are you female  fuck is wrong with  my bad  yeah im a bitch   hey sweet thing  chandra  were working on our short essay   if you  diamonds are a girls best friend  need to get down to lay down  naman if you dont stop im gonna have to ask you to leave class  see you sadass motherfuckers in about 3 days  youre leaving class not school  what about now bitch huh  thats not necessary naman  oh you gonna suspend me  were gonna have a little talk  man fuck yall  i know the rules  you gotta suspend me school gotta have rules  he right you gotta have rules  throw that shit out  the point is i can call it like you want  you want him to pass he passed  you want him to come up inconclusive hes inconclusive  the fuck kind of science is that  come on did he blow the box or not  im here for you detective  you know what we use the polygraph for  leverage  to get him in here and fuck with him  no wonder this shits inadmissible  let me guess  theyre out in the hall and stotowski is telling them  that he can make it go any way they want  if you think thats how we play it then why let your client  because you know theres not much case left now that your witness is dead  i dont need to expose him to a federal charge if i can avoid it  and because even if stotowski bends it for our ears  hes let you know that mr wardell here did not blow the box  yo i wouldnt kill me  even if it flips on me i aint gonna do shit to the man  why not  my moms and his theyre like cousins  came up together in the latrope you know  ive been knowing him since like head start and shit  but he was gonna testify  what im looking at on the first conviction on this kind of wave  ill be out in 312  you think im gonna kill my moms cousins boy for 312  i know that man helped get himself elected claiming that  i did me like that but please  bumass motherfucker was gonna testify against me  and i swear to god i feel bad hes dead  i do  hey eileen  been looking all over for you  omar little  from birds trial a couple years ago  the stickup boy  hes in city jail on felony murder  store robbery west side  when i gave him the card  i told him it was for a light felony at best  yeah of course but  he needs to get right out of bcdc  and put in protective custody somewhere else  im sharing his address with about 800 other guys  who have seen the business end of his shotgun  why do you care  im pretty sure that hes being set up on this one  really how does that play with the rest of the guys in the squad room  look all im asking is that you move him  to some county detention center  at least until i have a chance to work back up on this thing  now this card ought to buy him that much  is hartford county detention center quiet enough  go pick up a writ in my office  and tell mr little my debts paid  the fact is that homicides are off  but im not gonna stand here and take credit for that  when all other ucr felonies are up  why not major  a wise man once told me years ago when i wasnt even a sergeant  that you should never take credit when the crime rate drops  unless you want to take the blame when it rises  attenhut  mayorelect is on deck  please back to what youre doing  im just a councilman here to observe  at ease gentlemen  major daniels continue your presentation  in any event rather than allow my post cars to patrol  the grand deputy i put twoman cars in the post  with the worst drug corners  edmonson avenue poplar grove fayette and baltimore streets  north avenue  now if nothing else a twoman car is more aggressive  and that helps push it away from the most volatile corners  which may be having an effect  just pushing it  im not devoting my resources to cheap street arrests commissioner  instead im trying to bring every officer i can to bear  on making quality felony cases  i could do more but well its my opinion that not  enough of the troops i have are sufficiently trained  to properly investigate such cases  major you just insulted your command  respectfully sir  too many of my people have spent years  chasing streetlevel arrests  while they grab bodies and make stats  but that doesnt teach you how to write a proper warrant  or testify properly as to probable cause  or use and not get used by an informant  i wish it were otherwise  but if im chasing felony cases  i can only bring a minority of my officers to bear  you got all of it already  thats right  make a nigger work  you like that shit  aint that right motherfucker  you cant hide son  dont care where it is  in a niggers ass crack ill still find you  damn fucked that man up  yeah boy  all right  so we starting a little later than i wanted  yo but you said you was gonna peep out of school after lunch  i tried they wont put me out

enable me to find my fucking camera   youre seeing pigeons  last night we did  me and sander ran the west side  looking at every pigeon coop we could find  this morning nothing in the monitor  you

that marlows people did  i meant to call bunk on it  bunk caught the case  no actually he had a warrant for the guy who supposedly got killed  i rode around with him on it a while back  what about me  i got problems here man  the only thing you can do is get some wood on marlow stanfield or his people  scare him enough to send the camera back  what do you have on marlow  i know hes a drug dealer  i cant prove it or nothing but i know  detective pitts pick up 2594 pitts  ok listen  how about i let you debrief the kid first  see what he can give you  this gets the camera home  maybe not but you talk to the runt  and maybe he gives you some shit on marlow  maybe even gives you a murder or two and before you call homicide on it  you walk it back to mello  like the cat with the mouse in its teeth  you bring him the murder he probably forgives the camera  loomin line 5  loomin pick up the fucking phone  looking for detective moreland  could you have him call sergeant carver at the western please  carver western  wait a minute  got it  fuck that bunk  thoughts on your cabinet  lots of them  but top of the list irvin burrells ass is gone  i told royce to dump him more than a year ago  but clarence didnt want to piss off the ministers until after the primary  primarys over he can do it now  you think clarence royce is gonna do you that favor  hes already thinking about taking a poke at elisha  and running for the seventh district congressional seat  hes gonna need every black minister in town to lay hands upon him  fine ill do it myself  no you wont  royce can fire a black police commissioner  but the newly elected white mayor cannot  same brothers who voted for you be at your throat  what if i got a black commissioner to replace the son of a bitch  under burrell the only black deputy is cawthorne  and hes 70  after that its just majors and lieutenants  we go outside nationwide search  deputy chiefs in new york or la  make more than their police commissioner  if youre talented and black why would you be in baltimore  i have often asked myself that very question  on a number of occasions  so im stuck with burrell fuck  have a seat  dont keep him late  hes gotta be
