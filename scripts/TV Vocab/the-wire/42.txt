they was snatching people up  stealing their warmth   st jude patron of lost causes  tell me you aint been on bended knee  whispering in his saintly ear each and every night  before you close those peepers  i know you have tommy catch a break like this  stan youre sure about this  on my mothers soul its a lock  assigned a rookie a broad no less  as lead detective  pulled a good man off too i heard  tom  tommy remember anything you need  hes a piece of work  valchek comes with the territory  you want the first district council seat  you make nice with whatever polish or greek commander   they dump in the southeast  not italian  there aint enough of us left down there  you think he has this right   that royce tampered with the case  no way the mayor knows  youre right this one has ervin burrell written all over it  fuck if the mayor knows or not  if its true we get it out there quick and bang him hard  i go public  they cant spin this they sabotaged a criminal case  no spin on a knuckleball  you still cant tell how its gonna break  we feed it to tony gray  we keep ourselves out of the line of fire sting royce  and as an added bonus give grays campaign a boost  which comes at the expense of the mayors base  im a devious motherfucker once i get going  so all told  were looking at 13 warrants and 6 locations  and given my staffing situation  not a problem  i can give you my deu flex and ops squads  a sector of uniforms if you need it   great  the problem is  youre wasting a wiretap on streetlevel arrests  we do these raids right  we might catch marlo or one of his lieutenants at one of these locations  get them with dope on the table  marlo stanfield  in a room with dope on the table  ive kicked down doors  and surprised bigger players than him  well let me warn you lieutenant  i am not about to litigate a wiretap for a handful of street rips  well thats on you counselor  no its not  major see you tomorrow  floaters you had any more  no more than usual for the season  what about decomps  what do you got in the decomp room   2 or 3 unidentifieds  found in baltimore  no actually two from prince georges one from dorchester  nah he wouldnt drive that far  let me get this straight  youre looking for extra bodies no one in particular  other than this one kid you already put out on the teletype  yeah you on it  you fellas dont have enough work  if you do your classwork homework  you earn stickers  dag yo every day you be changing it up  you got us confused mr p  behave in class thats another sticker  at the end of the week the 4 with the most stickers  get a prize  and are eligible for a grand drawing at the end of the month  dont do your work misbehave in class  your name goes here  detention  a full hour after school no exceptions  so its up to you  stickers for prizes or stay with me after school  yo mr p why you do me detention  you interrupted the class namond  yo when you first came in here  you was all treating us straight up  and now you just dog me before i even know the rules  that aint right man  when youre right namond youre right  hey mr p i want me some of them stickers  zenobia you have to do your work  i want to but i aint got no pencils  i dont want no damn welfare pencil  it seems to me  there are two kinds of kids walking in this building  stoop kids corner kids   excuse me  you know stoop kids  the ones who stay on their front steps when their parents tell them  the others go down to the corners  they cant sit still in the class  the others can and do  so separate the two   thats tracking  excuse me  tracking students  its a nasty phrase in educational circles  it refers to the grouping of children based on expected performance  well whats wrong with it  it says you have reduced expectations for certain students  that you expect less from them academically  so you pretend to teach all these kids  and the truth is you aint teaching any of them  but what if the stoop kids could be in classrooms   where there was no disruptions  and the corner kids  theyre the ones youre after right  thats why you got the grant money  as long as this doesnt involve warehousing children  im for anything that allows me to do my job  every teacher here will tell you the same  the trick for you is to come up with a program  that actually addresses itself to the corner kids  i dont know if we pull kids out of regular classes  wont they be stigmatized  theres not a stigma at being booted out of class every other day  question is  how do we identify the corner kids  that wont be a problem  ok  you understand the work  come on this is easy i know you can do it  youre not giving me a choice you have detention  yo nay mrs d shaking bushes  back to your seats  what the fuck she got my blade yo  i said back to

use you up sherrod  you welcome to stay tonight  but you aint in school tomorrow morning  this partnership need to be done  these two precincts are the bellwether for the fifth  if you can take even 18 out of carcetti in these  its a good guess he wont have the numbers citywide  and who are we ticketed with over here  the ndo i hope because  this amid allegations  that highranking police officials intervened  to have a veteran police detective removed from the controversial case  the braddock murder became a focal point in the mayoral campaign  when councilman thomas carcetti alleged  the west baltimore man was killed  because he was a witness in the case  because they were afraid  the police would prove what they most fear  that fredro braddock was murdered  because he was a witness and the city failed to protect him  its on all 3 channels  and the sun and the post are both calling for comment  and my sources within the department say the rankandfile officers  are simply appalled by this blatant political manipulation  damn turn it up  hey greggs youre famous  is to remove a highly decorated veteran  15 years experience as a murder investigator  without reason   thatd be me  then replaced with a rookie  who has yet to handle a single homicide investigation  thatd be you   then we need to rethink  the fuck i ever do to him  you gonna make it too heavy yo  it might work if we make it bigger  it would work if we had balsa wood you know its really light and strong  man you so full of  oh shit  zombie master  need to take us a little walk  nah im good here  younguns need to move along  sure chris well bump  yo snoop your sister in my class  what the fuck you high or something nay  you boys be smoking that shit  hearing good things about you  say you

couple of tourists  maybe fly a helicopter into harbor place  what can we expect the last week of my reelection campaign  sir i did what you asked no more no less  hamsterdam legalized drug zone  he takes responsibility for that   the subpoenas all over town  that too  the leak about the witness murder i mean that was his shop too right   hell yeah  and now this last thing  transferring detectives off the case  what is that what is that  scuttling the investigation  yeah right yeah thats awful jesus  mr mayor you asked me to slow that investigation down  subtle ervin  you hold a few facts for a few weeks  you put a report or two in a desk drawer  but the transferring of people off a case  look you told me  you specifically wanted me to not  ervin you may leave   mr mayor  that will be all commissioner  no i need a word or two with your deputy ervin  have a seat  i tried to warn him  i mean if it leaked out of homicide about the dead witness  why wouldnt it leak that we bumped a detective  why didnt you come to us beforehand  im a loyal subordinate mr mayor  and ervin is a good man working under considerable pressure  hes a hack  youre not bothered by the pressure deputy  not in the least  i need you to make this go away bill  i wont forget believe me  another thing slim charles got up with me  said the fat man want a sitdown  nah i did that already  well slim say the fat man knew the card game was gonna get took  he did did he  set it up  why you always be back here  quiet and i can see what comes  but you out in the weather and shit  i dont like to speak in no rooms  yeah  yo you aint staying long  so you know i almost got that for you  i just need a couple of days more  you can keep my money for now  i got something that needs doing  anything marlo your call  omar gonna come in your store stick it up rob you  you gonna call the police make a report   you feel me  yeah thatll work but  you know when he get out hes coming right at me  i aint scared or nothing im just saying you know  he aint gonna get out  a man make bail on robbery  make it no bail  if you have a problem  like you cant make it to detention  you need to tell me  thats your responsibility  people will be more than willing to help you out  but its up to you to ask  you can go back to the cafeteria  or hang up here  duquan could you come here  i thought maybe you could help me out  i packed too much  take this down to the cafeteria  and get yourself something to drink from the machine  thank you  crystal you got a second  whats up with duquan  i gave him some new clothes i was expecting  he might have lost them  that fast  it werent that  his people take his clothes sell it on the corners  youre kidding  no sir everybody knows  which brings me to what were proposing  different kids different approaches  you tell us who we need to touch at north avenue to get the goahead  the puzzle palace  look if yall still want to jump in and help  im fine with it  thats about all the ok you need in my house  the stricker street situation is waiting in the office  neighborhood squabbles and my babies bring it in here  two fights yesterday  all because the mothers cant get along  i got to go  mrs donnelly will work out the nuts and bolts  but just so you hear it thank you  itll be the only time anyone in this system will think to say it  hes a good man you need to protect him  protect him  principal withers just went out on a limb for you  and in this system they know how to handle a chainsaw  excuse me  anyone has a problem with what were doing its on him  so you specified eighthgraders  we have 256 on roll   of those 40 or so would fit your bill of corner kids   pretty workable  what would you suggest  start with 10 or so  ms sampson has enough to get you going  one of them named namond brice  pick of the litter  but youll have to wait hes on a 3day suspension  remember when i was a cadet  i was up here on a cadaver search  instructor gets on the radio to say  were looking for one body in particular  if you go grabbing everyone you see  well be here all day he says  leakin park  where west baltimore brings out its dead  not anymore from the look of things  not by the roadside anyway  if hes dumping them here  hes dumping them deep in the woods  come on  at each raid site  were anticipating dope or cash or guns  all warrants are for prime locations linked to highlevel violators  weeksold addresses linked to lowlevel corner boys  well also be sweeping drug corners at these locations  wagons will hold in this location here  jumpoff time 1500 hours  we take our position 10 minutes before the assault here  the go is on my sayso  questions excellent  well hold the rec room till its time to stage  warrants are one thing  but street sweeps on marlo stanfields crews  are you guys serious  carv you give these hoodleheads too much credit  trust me on this boy wonder  never mind this horseshit  so whatve they got you doing for your man  who the lieutenant  no royce  herc the mayors your meal ticket  he gets another 4 years youre liable to wear the gold braids  shouldnt you be out waving a campaign sign or some shit  and so ends the last crusade of the major crimes unit  with a whimper  lester would cry to see his wiretap cannibalized for that crap  street sweeps on marlo stanfield  so what else you got cooking  narcotics cases  cid has the burman indictment coming in  nothing past that  as wars go this drug thing seems to rate less and less  if demper wins and manages to forgive my trespasses  maybe ill go in and beg for something new  i dont know  just feels like enoughs enough  crutchfield line two intake   sergeant you were looking for me  i was yeah  curly fry chicken doohickey  sit down  norris is back on the braddock case  its by order of the deputy ops  in fact were gonna go with a story that says he was never off the case  that you and he are partnered a task force of two  working it together  fuck you fat man  not original but succinct i like your approach  yall humiliate me once by dropping me into this thing  and now youre gonna shame me again by bringing norris back  this is homicide detective  this is not some boiler room unit  where no one pays attention to whatever the fuck it is you call police work  the bosses they know our names up here  now i didnt like it when they came to me  and told me to dump norris  but dump him i did  and its not like i want to carry water for them now  that theyre pretending they never told me to do any such thing  but carry the water i will and in the end  when everyone else in this unit is buried and beshitted  this detective sergeant will still be standing  so get the story straight  norris was always the primary  and you are now assisting on an investigation  which is progressing even as we speak  does the colonel know about this  hes in the hospital  chemo didnt work  press conference is upstairs in half an hour  so dont be late  press conference  i aint mean to laugh at you none  i know it sound crazy but i aint joking  for real lex a zombie  i knew it way before what nay and them was saying  listen  they had me tell lex to go up to the playground  i told him to go up there and see some girl  he aint never come back down  so what they gonna do to me when they get mad at me  it makes sense chris taking them into the vacants  to change them and you know what else  that aint what hes doing  chris and the vacants changing them  he aint changing them he killing them  thats all theyre getting killed  how you know  cant tell nobody  i seen it  i seen them walk a boy up into one house over there on calhoun  you seen that  yeah  thats just false  detective norris has been working this case nonstop  and given her narcotics expertise  detective greggs was assigned to augment rather than to replace him  but for two days  sources inside the department were saying  im inside the department and im telling you thats not true  we do not play politics with a criminal investigation  and how do you explain councilman grays allegations  i think you should ask councilman gray that question  police search warrant  take the back  on the ground now  police search warrant  two upstairs   dont move  check that back room  i said get your ass on the ground   get down  get down  this is the 1300 block right  no this is the 12  are we on the right corner   we had this as a stash house  according to the wiretap  how long ago they move them around you know  zeroes on the warrants  minor arrests on the designated corners sir   they were tipped  you think  for us to come up this empty at all these locations it has to be  this cocksucker marlo thinks hes smarter than us  he is not  sergeant i want to know where he hangs  you mean like him personally  he moves around lieutenant he floats  but i have seen him in the concrete park behind fulton   in a park  if the weathers right  he sits out there in lawn chairs holds court  hes got people covering every approach so theres no creeping up on him  my guess is that he likes to talk outdoors  so no one can drop a microphone on him  sergeant what can we do with that  i admit ive made some mistakes  burrell being one of the biggest  hes got a job for about 10 more days  after the primary hes gone believe me  and that last stunt pulling a detective  whatd you expect  not that  hey i had nothing to do with that nonsense  now thats a straightup lie  i was at that damn meeting when you told him  slow the case down  i didnt mean  who the hell knows what you mean anymore clarence  look at this  look at it  you gave me your word on this  your word clarence  but here you are ticketed up with eunetta in her best precincts  and then ticketed up with my girl daniels  where shes running strong  odell this is the first ive seen this  come on now this is probably eunettas people pulling this shit  with a citizens for royce authority line  look at you clarence just look at
