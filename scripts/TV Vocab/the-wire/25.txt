rados whats he  he rented the hotel room for the meet with vondopoulos  but checked out right after  fitzhughs running him through every database  so far nothing but a drivers license in dc  lester homicide for you line 2  maybe sobotka knows him  when sobotka comes in today maybe he gives us a line on every last greek  freamon here  thirteen or so coming across the fax from vicap  all of them john does  and thats just headless and handless in the midatlantic region  if you wanna go nationwide youll be up over four dozen   fuck me  what can i tell you kiddo  we are policing a culture in moral decline so you want to come get these  or should i have a uniform run them over to southeast   run them over to southeast  okay   have a seat  i cant  gotta get back out there take care of business  just wanted to make sure they were treating you right  making the most of it im catching up on my reading at least  i just want to let you know that we got your back  you know whoever did this well find them  we got you you understand  i appreciate the offer but that wont be necessary  inform mr barksdale that any obligation  he feels he might have with regards to this incident  its

fuck you gonna do  get a gun go play gangster  like your fucking cousin  lets go  what was she firing yo  dirty bomb with a redtop chaser  damn yo the bomb is the bomb  opportunity knocking keep a lookout  he just boosted the whole fucking truck  good looking out johnny  at least i remembered to call  stabbed repeatedly  torso abdomen and they cut his throat to be sure  singleedge blade he fought too  defense wounds on both hands  ligature on both legs  weighed him down with something but it slipped off in the drink  one two three  fuck it this sobotka kid knows theres a warrant  he either turns himself in or not who gives a fuck  either we get to him now and roll him or he comes into the district with a lawyer  he comes in with a lawyer hes less likely to go for something in the box  you sound like mcnulty now  we stay with these guys on their cases we aint never gonna get no respect  you know this  i figure when the details over i go back to straight narcotics  try to get over to dawsons shift find a new rabbi  what about you  dont know  i mean you gotta admit daniels has been okay for us  i mean hes there for his troops   you gotta be shitting me  i just came from the crime scene  he was coming in as a cooperator  offering up the drugandprostitution ring hed been smuggling for  the guy lays down with gangsters gets up with his throat cut  almost feel sorry for the son of a bitch  you were right about sobotka  case had enough legs on it that ive got burrell committed  to keeping my crew together as a major case squad working out of cid  if you are gonna charge him  im gonna charge his narrow ass  youre gonna do your soninlaw  you dont think i didnt tell her not to marry that braindead son of a bitch  ill tell you the truth major everyone who saw the punch wrote on it  and theyve all got prez throwing the punch no question  but theyve also got you addressing a subordinate officer as a  what was it a shitbird  fuck you  this is the baltimore police department not the roland park ladies tea  im just saying the other detectives  the fbi agents they gotta write it the way it happened  i mean i could probably get my own people to cheat it for you but the fbi  you know how tightassed they are  roland pryzbylewski rides the southeastern desk  on midnight shift for two months  during which time he writes a personal letter of apology  to everyone seen that punch throwed  in which he makes it absolutely clear that it was a pennycheap sucker punch  that wouldve got his ass kicked in by a real police  except for the fact that i have my daughters feelings to consider  and then he can come up here and say the same to my face  and after that if he wants to piss his career away in your unit  i could give a hairyass fuck  lieutenant  rod that shit goes into a supplemental   you dont put witnesses on a face sheet  officer  you got something for freamon homicide sent it over  officer my son wants to turn himself in on a warrant  everybody talks nobody listens  mike that asshole calls back im in the shitter   now what can i do for you gents  you got a warrant on me for drugs   im turning myself in  a southeastern warrant  hes surrendering hes gonna cooperate in any way he can   what name am i looking for  sobotka nicholas sobotka  morphine from a city ambo  you should be ashamed to be calling me on this one   the body came up  i saw on the television  we weighted him down pretty goddamn good  but the water just coughed him back up  bad luck thats all  sergei wouldve done better i admit  niko the nephew by now he knows  our people wait for him but so do the police  i am thinking  theres nothing to be done at this point  what he says he says  he knows my name but my name is not my name  and you  to them youre only the greek  and of course im not even greek  so we go  but theres a little business to do first  theres a shipment on the docks this week   one hundred and fifty kilograms  and no one to pick it up  not just sergei i miss frank too  we cant disappear the can but maybe we send someone  bring it off the docks legitimate  everywhere we go these days we seem to be walking into police  this is telling us something  youre going to leave 15 million tholaria to rot on the pier  lambs go to slaughter a man he learns when to walk away  no we go  call the others in  let them know there is no longer any point  we dont wait  our friends are still there no   still here  then go  sobotka was a cooperator  we had preliminary discussions with him yesterday  he agreed to post today with a lawyer but instead  so whats left of the case  weve pulled in everyone caught up in the wiretaps save for a couple bodies  we left the man we think is the number two for the operation  on the street hoping hed lead us to number one  we have people on him  hes out of pocket at the moment  last seen leaving a downtown hotel but we expect hell resurface  and the union people  with sobotka dead the case right now is limited to a subordinate or two  but the important thing for us is the union  either they jettison their current leadership  or we have enough to get that local decertified  leaving only me and my 14 bodies  when do we get to that bit of business  lt daniels line 2 det freamon insisted i put him through  in all likelihood frank sobotka was going to speak to that  now were a step back sorry to say   sobotka came in  the nephew  yeah he flipped  come on bubs you gotta do better if you wanna walk on this   how about some murders  how about them  theyre not killing people in west baltimore these days  been quiet  except for that mess with that young boy who got hit  with the stray through the window aint been nothing   how about that  i aint got nothing on that one  its just two crews beefing over a corner  you know what bubs you going to jail  how you gonna talk about going to jail  you hearing this johnny  like we aint got history in this room like we aint friends or nothing  when you was up in that hospital all i did was worry  what about kima whats up with my girl  im just happy to see youre up in the mix  and you talking about jail and shit  thats too cold girl damn  remember that eastsider got shot in the highrises right  you remember that shit right  i mean you were right there bubbles  that wasnt shit boy got hit with a rat shot that all   who you talking about  boy named cheese  him and the other eastsiders moved into the terrace  took over a couple towers from the stringer bells boys  then some crazyass bowtie nigger came in and chased his ass home  and what happened  mr bow tie he ran them off  he told them eastsider fools them towers belong to avon  but then he aint come back no more  now them eastsiders are back up in there steady slinging  i mean it aint like a war or nothing  its like stringer bell and them are sharing  sharing  you guys are on all of it  you have a public defender sitting next to you mr sobotka  if theres anything about this deal you dont understand  they killed my uncle  i dont need to talk to no one but you people  how do you know they did it  i told  spiros calls me after everybodys getting arrested right  tells me he wants us to keep our mouths shut  but uncle frank he says he aint gonna  says hes gonna go talk to the police  spiros says that if we keep quiet  they can help my cousin zig you know  and now spiros is saying that  i dont know the kid the one that didnt die  the one that got shot  hes gonna say that the gun it wasnt zigs  that glekas pulled the gun and it wasnt really zigs fault  so your uncle went to meet them and talk about that  under the key bridge  i seen his car was still there this morning  i seen that i fucking knew  if they killed your uncle to shut him up they probably  wanna kill me too  shit  i was gonna go down with him to the bridge  i was gonna go down there with him  he wouldnt  you were involved in the smuggling  we didnt know about the girls  them girls that got found   we didnt know there were girls in there  you thought it was drugs  drugs stolen shit whatever  we got paid by the can to creep shit off the docks thats all  that and selling the drugs that you got from the greek too right  thats your cousins signed statement  he put himself in talked about buying the gun  the bill of sale from the pawn shop is in there too  it wouldnt have mattered if the second victim had backed up on his story  your cousin was locked in  your uncle was sitting yesterday right where youre sitting now  ready to give us everything if we made the drug charges go away for you  and maybe got your cousin to a better lockup than eager street  as you can see were willing to honor that deal  even if it didnt happen for your uncle  spiros was the main guy  he told me and frank which cans to disappear  and then when it came to me and the drugs he was the one that hooked that up too  the israeli he was their drug guy i went through him for all my reups  until they passed me off to white mike mcardle you know mike  guess you do  double g was in charge of stolen shit  anything we could lift from the docks went straight to his store  but hes dead so why am i wasting your time right  her i dont know  my uncle you know about him  i dont know why you got horses picture up there  horse dont know shit ill testify to that  what about the russian  he drove for them  anything that had to come off the docks he was their guy  but i also got the feeling that if somebody had to get hurt  he was probably going to be around for that part of it too  why did you think that  sergei he just carried it like that  and also after them girls died in the can  they told me that whoever fucked that up  they had already got to in philly  they said that whoever did that to them girls was dead  and how did they say it  they just said i dont know  that the guy that you all was looking for  he was a dead end   a dead end  yeah  in philly they said  whos the suit  you sure  we know that someone is above your man spiros  someone he was in communication with  yeah the greek  sure i know who you mean i mean i dont have a name or nothing  the man in the suit  the man with vondopoulos in the photograph  thats not the greek  thats the greek right there  that the guy  he picked out an eastsider all right  cheese runs with proposition joes mob  had a few corners off of ashland last i heard   whats the verdict  he did good for us   so im out the stat  i owe you one sanny   both of them  yeah that ones his valet  can i use your bathroom  fuck no get out of here  bubs one last question hows product in the towers  it was shit now its right  found this guy federal court computer down in dc  but not in a bad way  hes a k street lawyer down there  so the suit was only a suit  on the other hand my friend this is from overseas  a can on the adriatica which docks the day after tomorrow at patapsco  fake manifest out of le havre  you people got reach  thats about 300000 in
