says otherwise colonel  sir norris is good police  look ray we need someone who can work it hard  work it around the clock work it till it falls  and i understand we just pumped some fresh blood into homicide  female took one in the line a few years back  shes never worked homicide  fresh eyes then  but with all due respect sir  if i could guarantee that no further information  on this case would be leaked to the press  certainly not before election day  would it be possible to keep veteran investigators working it sir  i resent the implication  my apologies sir  you killing my time coming up
