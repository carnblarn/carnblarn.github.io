and off he goes  guy says christ dominic you just called  the president of the united states an sob  he shrugs he says fuck im  i dont need him he lost   thats good that is good  and that is from whence i come  proud son of the fighting first district  but the truth is  i dont wanna be just another muldoon like dominic dipietro  warming the backbench  not with the way things are right now in the city  were losing 10 12000 residents a year  and when you ask em why theyre moving to the county  you know what they say  schools  and crime  schools and crime  and there goes our tax base right

effect saying major  is rather than lookin at this cluster of robberies  you had along monument street  you chose to investigate each using separate personnel  no sir  three of those cases were commercial robberies  so we sent those downtown to cid  my people had responsibility  goddamnit marvin  did you just invoke the word responsibility to explain why  you didnt get on top of this shit  did you just do that  i dont think you know what the word means  when i look at the 24s and plainly see  that some 38 caliber asshole is raping your entire district  all the way from greenmount to

 marlas a new face taking on a longtime incumbent  everything matters im afraid  well anything i can do to help  ill um  get out of the way and leave you all to it  marla i have to tell you that your photo with cedric  works really well on the mailing  yeah   i sure hope he knows what hes in for  because its going to be a long race for the both of you   speaking of which youve got to make some   jesus who called the media  naw you think the man might respect  my shit enough to let me step up  but it aint even go like that   why not  he gonna give lavells corners to that offbrand nigga cheese   an you know what joe my uncle an shit   i mean im kin to the fat motherfucker   that idiot worked for us hed be a deputy commissioner by now  aint no luck at all to this case  and how in all good conscience can i  as chairman of this subcommittee  authorize anymore abovetheline overtime  when its clear enough from the data in front of me  that that money is not going to go to line officers  or working detectives  but is being to be paying for drivers and clerical  and jesus look at this  so that two colonels and three majors can attend  a community policing seminar in miami florida  mr chairman  what does south beach have to teach this department  about making baltimore a safer place commissioner  i have no idea  and you have no idea and it is an embarrassment  cedric  theyre gone   i want to thank you for this  no problem  its not easy i know  but they seem to think it matters  that i present myself as  im fine with it  all those years you were all about my career  well its the least i can do right  goodnight  were not holding anything up in his district   repaving foot patrols streetlights   hes getting his share   unless its not about his district   its about him   maybe hes got big eyes for something   for what  not me not my chair not in this town  oh no  if the man came off any whiter hed be seethrough  but if thats it come on with it  in fact please jesus  or maybe john the baptist   soften you up for someone else  if hes gonna bang us on crime  bang me on crime  look is there any way for you to talk to this guy  keep him from crawling up my ass  hes old first district  not a lot of favors we can call in over that side of town  so we gotta show him something right  four to five percent drop in felonies  and murders  get the murders down to under 250 for the year  all due respect mr mayor were at 232 now  what can you realistically do  best case scenario if we bump the overtime  is 275 maybe   thats a promise right  carcetti has no issue  gentlemen the word from on high  is that felony rates district by district  will decline by five percent before the end of the year  we are dealing in certainties  you will reduce the ucr felonies  by five percent or more or  ive always wanted to say this  let no man come back alive  in addition we will hold this years murders to 275 or less  christ  feeling a little fazed colonel foerster  a little dyspeptic  diswho  no sir  im good to go  hes a fun fact for you people  if baltimore had new yorks population  wed be clocking 4000 murders a year at this rate  there is no excuse i will except  i dont care how you do it  just fucking do it  deputy as familiar  as we all are with the urban crime environment  i think we all understand theres certain processes  by which you can reduce the number of overall felonies  you can reclassify an agg assault  or you can unfound a robbery  but how do you make a body disappear  there is not one of you in this room  who isnt here by appointment  if you want to continue wearing those oak clusters  you will shut up and step up  any of you who cant bring the numbers we need  will be replaced by someone who can  that is all  jesus
