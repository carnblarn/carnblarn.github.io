little to the right  good bring her down  its there whenever they want it  now that you are my client mr bell  we are protected by the attorneyclient privilege   i thought roberto would be here  not likely  this im afraid was in mondays papers  it seems roberto castellano y silva has been targeted by the dea  thats why we didnt do the business  right now roberto and his people arent going to be getting involved in anything  that could further complicate the situation  you know usually when you take a fall you get right back in there   cause you know nobodys watching right  sometimes  and sometimes you wonder how it is you got caught in the first place  and you decide to change the pattern  he took our money  your advance payment arrived as our problem did  and im told the money is on the way back to baltimore  you know i get the feeling that youre blaming us  for robertos predicament  perhaps your problems in baltimore and my clients problems here  are coincidental   but right now  listen to me  he was the first to know that we took a hit  he knows no one came close to rolling over us  and all the documents from the case  nonetheless we have a legitimate concern  considering the scope of mr barksdales operation  his sentence was to say the least mild  but if the possibility exists however unlikely  that the leniency he received was the result of cooperation  you understand our position im sure  frank its sitting out there waiting  and this russian fuck wont take it off the pier  i aint blind  i dont like it sitting out in the open that long  the customs seal is broke somebodys gonna see it  our asses are hanging out here   yeah  nicky what the fuck its still here   shit  yeah   wheres sergei  hes parked at the end of the lot   whats he waiting for  i got

their toll  you big nasty detective come here  let me give your little booboo a kiss   all this  im just getting started  1000 for the doctor  1000 each time girlfriend every month till im pregnant
