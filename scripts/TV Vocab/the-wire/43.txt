                on this sunday before the primary  when we will go to the polls to exercise our blessed franchise  our lesson comes from exodus chapter 18  and it came to pass on the morrow  that moses sat to judge the people  and the people stood by him  from the morning unto the evening  and moses judged the people  and he shouldered this tremendous burden all alone  and one day his fatherinlaw said to him  moses why do you carry  this awesome responsibility by yourself  you need other wise men to help you rule  justly over the people  so moses harkened to the voice of his fatherinlaw  and chose able men to rule over the people  can i preach it like i feel it  this tuesday when we choose the men and women  who will lead our city  we would do well to keep those standards

these around  jesus tommy  i spent a couple hours going over the latest data  rearranged the schedule  a little bit of knowledge  theres a bunch of middleclass black precincts  which are strong on tony but still undecided  we can pick up some votes in those neighborhoods  those people hate the mayor youre gonna get them   and if you dont gray will  we go door to door today  as long as they dont go to royce  i need some black votes if im gonna be mayor  i need some kind of mandate from that community  if i sneak in with a bare plurality  we might just win this thing  what do you think kept me up all night  with all due respect to your early morning analysis  we got 3 backtoback drivetime radio interviews  i wore out my kneepads to get  the people running your campaign are professionals tommy  dont try this shit at home  you know there might just be a job for you  in a carcetti administration  press secretary chief of staff  oh get in the fucking car  duquan  mr prez  can you come

know you could   sir  at ease  man i hate it when the bosses creep below the eighth floor  yeah well i need a moment just to unclench my asshole  sir  the braddock investigation  its coming norris and greggs are wringing it out  i fuckin know its coming  commissioner burrell had a visit first thing this morning  from states attorney demper himself  asking why one day before the primary  our detectives were trying to writ out a jailhouse snitch  the tip came when it did  i didnt push it and i didnt hold it back either  let the chips fall where they may  exactly sir  sergeant fuck your falling chips  if braddock was killed because he was a witness  and we break the case one day before the primary  royce hates us forever and royce might win the election  if braddock was killed for any other reason  and we break it today  then carcetti hates our guts and carcetti could win  i see your point  tactical tells me were still about 20 bodies short  for manning the polling places  i want you to detail 2 detectives  to uniformed election duty immediately  lemme guess norris and greggs  sounds good  theyre to report to tactical at 1300 today  for election orientation  they can pick up their writ  and talk to their snitch on wednesday  american democracy  lets show those thirdworld fucks how its done  yes sir  i have what i think is some very good news for all of you  were going to be implementing  the university of maryland pilot program  youre only taking 3 of my knuckleheads  a total of 10 children from the eighth grade  in this first class   if things go well  its a start   when  this morning  hallelujah  not a moment too soon  how was i  good on steiner better on the am talk shows  i thought you handled that call about the flyers well  fucking royce  if i lose because of this bullshit  you lose we can blame it on  same thing if you win  guess who i just got off the phone with  state senator davis he wants a meet  clay davis  why would i wanna get into bed with that grasping motherfucker  he didnt actually say it  but it sounds like hes ready to follow watkins  and jump the mayors ship  whats he want in return  shit same thing he always wants  at least 20k to his favorite campaign committee is my guess  maybe even 30 cause you know clay aint cheap  well im not promising him anything policywise  you think clay davis gives a fuck about policy  naw this is strictly for services rendered  he might be conning us  taking the money then sitting on his hands  maybe but then all we have to lose is money  could be the extra little push we need on the westside
