should stay on him see who he really is  how about it  throw us a few of your wellequipped surveillance teams  in case you havent noticed lieutenant im the only fed still in the room  the us attorney has what he wants with the union guys  which means my field office is pretty much over this case  okay were on vondopoulos ourselves  im sorry for him  and for you  we shouldve paid more attention to our own  like i couldve stopped ziggy from what hed done  like anyone could ever control him  i was thinking of my boy too  theyre dropping the net on all the guys  aint no secret things get lost in them cans now and again  hell be all right  they tossed my house frank  they dont do that when theres a couple of cases of vodka missing  they made me sign the search warrant thats a receiptlike for what they found  heroin frank from this house  no that aint right that cant be right  i knew nicky and zig was boosting stuff cameras shit like that nothing like this  you knew  and once nicky got used to boosting stuff and seeing a little money  what did you think he was gonna do turn straight all of a sudden and give it up  no frank  once you gave him a taste on the house just  that was never

registered to  stephen rados he gave a northwest dc address  maybe thats the man with the good tailor maybe not  we should run out the paper trail on this guy see what we turn up  as to our only tangible piece of progress from the raids  what can we do for our friend white mike  he rolls on his suppliers and he can walk with a long probation   and we can move him if he needs  witness protection  why have the feds with you if theyre not gonna step up every now and then  wait a second youre gonna give a drug dealer a ride like that  what about frank sobotka  the feds took a shot at him and got nothing  or so they tell me  the way i read it they cared more about busting up the union  than anything else in the case if we came at frank straight  you cant make him any kind of specific offer yourself  only i can do that and only after i get an okay from my front office   she could plant the seed  theres no better messenger counselor  take a shot   you going to his house  the union hall thats his house  thanks for waiting brucie sorry im late  i shouldnt even be seen with you at this point  i just wanna settle our business while we still can  it aint like im gonna get my hands on more cash obviously  the grain pier is dead  half the votes we had lined up are walking sideways now  they read the paper frank  so what so im dirty the grain piers still the grain pier right  they aint voting for me brucie it aint about me  im not gonna lie  no one is gonna stand with us now that the fbi is on you   theyre scared  of what  they took the money frank  and now if they deliver the votes they figure the feds will be on them too  im sorry frank  you find a way of putting this fbi thing to bed  maybe we can come back the next session with the grain pier  youll have a couple of people down there knowing they owe you a vote or two  i dont know what else to say i dont im sorry frank  you know what the trouble is brucie  we used to make shit in this country build shit  now we just put our hand in the next guys pocket  come on you cant eat only olives order something lamb or something  im not hungry  all this trouble   so our associates they are strong  yes  i dont worry about our people we can try to get them out before the trial  if not they will stand for us  we have shown them too much there will be no more trouble  we must make certain of this   maybe theres another way  there is only one sure way  hear me out  if i could guarantee that frank sobotka and his nephew  would be silent  wouldnt you prefer that  but you cannot guarantee this  franks son the idiot who shot george in his store  he is going to jail for a long time  unless  there was a young clerk wounded that day in the store  the prosecutors want to use him as a witness  i know his family  frank sobotka will have his son back  if a man can have this why would he talk to the police  what about franks nephew  he is the idiots cousin he wants the same thing as frank  anyway i dont worry about niko  you are fond of him spiros  you shouldve had a son  but then i wouldve had a wife  if this maggot doesnt post by midnight im gonna take it personal  the shitbird lives in his parents
