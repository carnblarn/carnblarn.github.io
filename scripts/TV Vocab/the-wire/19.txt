                aint working out for yall huh   mars is the god of war right  planet too  i know its a planet but the clue is greek god of war  ares  greeks called him ares same dude different name thats all  ares fits thanks  its all good  see back in middle school and all i used to love them myths  that stuff was deep truly  youre up  state calls omar little your honor  faggot  do you solemnly swear to tell the truth  the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god  i surely do   state your name for the record  omar devon little   mr little how old are you  about 29 thereabout   and where do you live  no place in particular maam   youre homeless  in the wind so to speak   and what is your occupation  occupation  what exactly do you do for a living mr little  i rip and run   you  i robs drug dealers  and exactly how long has this been your occupation mr little  i dont know exactly  i venture to say maybe about eight or nine years  mr little how does a man rob drug dealers for eight or nine years  and live to tell about it  day at a time i suppose  what do we know  on sobotka very little he seems to live within his means  house in glen burnie paidoff truck modest savings   credit history is okay  theres no flash to him nothing dramatic  doesnt sound much like a money man to me   or maybe hes hiding it  the union is also a little threadbare  they paid the taxes on union hall almost a year late  and that was only after they got hit with liens  looking at their books   you subpoenaed their books  you dont need to  ibs books are open to the justice department  under the terms of a federal racketeering case   that came out of new york five years ago  we called washington  they sent us a copy of everything the baltimore locals have filed  the books show that theres less than a 100 checkers  still paying dues to 1514  and thats down from about 300 in the 70s theyre hurting  so wheres all this money valchek is talking about  the ibs hired bruce dibiago to lobby annapolis this session  and through individual officers and union members  theyve paid about 70000 to various pacs  and democratic organizations in the last eight months  they show any of that on their books  no we pieced that together from the campaign finance reports  thats just what was in the names of the union officers we crossreferenced   so wheres the cash coming from  drugs  so far dnrs on the union hall phones dont show much  union business and personal calls but no beepers  and not much in the way of cell numbers or payphones either  whats with those handtohands anything connect  were buying from a lot of white boys  odonnell heights greektown highlandtown above the park   but any port connections feel random  the money comes from somewhere  maybe its what the checkers do  i mean  they monitor what comes in and out of the port   thats what they do thats their value  theyre bringing the shit in  or theyre letting it happen  like that can full of dead girls they kept that out of the computer  which is why were gonna quietly do some work on that side of things  kima prez i want you to start looking at girls  no problem  if theyre coming into baltimore whos working them  are they club dancing whoring we need to plug into that circuit  as for the rest of you  lester is gonna stay with the paper trail and with the dnrs  looking for connections to the union money  herc and carver  you guys keep working the drug corners near the port  officer russell here and bunk moreland are assigned to homicide  but for the time being theyll be with us  running the port database looking for any pattern involving contraband  questions  excuse me   im thomas  beadie  would you like to go to royal farms maybe get a cup of coffee  right  yo im thomas you want a coffee  listen i was gonna ask her for her panties to make some soup with  but i was afraid shed take it the wrong way  you were at the opposite end of the parking lot   when the assailant drew his gun  thereabout  do you see the gunman who killed mr gant anywhere in the courtroom today  yo what up bird  for the record you are identifying the defendant marquis hilton  its just bird to me  and mr little you had seen him many times before had you not   yeah we jailed together down the cut  objection your honor may we approach  quite a witness aint he  word on the street is omar aint nowhere near them rises when the shit pop  street said little cocksucker was over on the east side  sticking up some ashland avenue niggers  thats the word on the street huh  trouble is string we aint on the street were in a court of law  your honor  objection is noted and preserved for the record mr levy move on  thank you your honor  jurors will disregard that last comment from the witness in which he explained  where he had last encountered the defendant  yes or no mr little  prior to the shooting did you know the defendant  i knew the man but wasnt like he was no friend or nothing  so you would have no trouble recognizing him from a moderate distance  say 20 25 yards in daylight  no problem  mr little do you recognize  this particular weapon  yeah thats birds gun the 380   youve seen it before  bird always flashing that thing  so youd actually seen it before the day in question   and on the day in question  it was in birds hand   when he shot at mr gant  yes maam   bird covet them shiny little pistols  objection your honor  and the boy too trifling to throw it off even after a daytime murder  youre a lying cocksucker man ill rip your heart out your goddamn chest  the defendant will regain control or he will be forcibly restrained  and i will clear the court  the witnesss last answer is to be stricken and disregarded by the jury  niko  eton is my friend  its good to have friends meet no  eton huh  thats from the greek meaning what  no greek israeli  yeah  cause you look greek no offense  either way i mean   you have the chemicals  i can get them as much as you want  when  i was gonna do something this week theres been a problem though   what problem  my cousin ziggy  he got into a beef with these east baltimore guys  drug dealer by the name of cheese took his car burned it  now hes saying hes gonna dust zig if he doesnt pay  yeah malaka right zig fucked up the package  so you bring us the chemicals we pay  then you pay your debt  it was 2700 right  now this asshole is saying its double 5400 you believe that  first he takes the car  and now hes jacking us around on the money   you want we kill him  no   that aint it either no  why no  cause first of all zig fucked it up he owes 2700  and second you kill cheese  and were gonna have a fight with his people right  a year down the road  some nigger sees my cousin coming out the burger shop  putting gas in his car on central avenue no questions puts a cap in his ass  hes smart huh niko smart  we dont have the muscle to go talk to this guy make things right  i was hoping maybe you do  mr little  can i ask why you came forward in this case   i told the police what i know  were you offered anything in exchange   like what  were you arrested  were you going to be charged with a crime and by testifying  did the police agree to drop those charges  no man it aint even about that  how many times have you been arrested as an adult mr little  shoot i done lost count  enough though not to take it personal  possession of a handgun  possessing a concealed weapon assault by pointing  robbery deadly weapon possession of a handgun again  followed by violation of parole on weapon charges  followed by one count of attempted murder  and use of a handgun in commission of a felony  that wasnt no attempt murder  what was it mr little  i shot the boy mikemike in his hind parts that all  fixed it so he couldnt sit right  whyd you shoot mikemike in his hind parts   lets say we had a disagreement  a disagreement over  mikemike thought he should keep that cocaine he was slinging  and the money he was making from slinging it  i thought otherwise  so you rob drug dealers this is what you do  yes sir  you walk the streets of baltimore with a gun  taking what you want when you want it  willing to use violence when your demands arent met  this is who you are  why should we believe your testimony then   why believe anything you say  thats up to yall really  you say you arent here testifying against the defendant   because of any deal you made with police  true that  that you are here because you want to tell the truth  about what happened to mr gant in that housing project parking lot  yup  when in fact you are exactly the kind of person who would  if you felt you needed to  shoot a man down on a housing project parking lot  and then lie to the police about it would you not  look i aint never put my gun on no citizen  you are amoral are you not  you are feeding off the violence and the despair of the drug trade  you are stealing from those who themselves are stealing the lifeblood from our city   you are a parasite who leeches off  just like you man  the culture of drugs excuse me what  i got the shotgun you got the briefcase  its all in the game though right  and with the economy what it is  you can really consider coming in  and still feel competitive   even on the hamburg street address  absolutely  i have to admit i like the house at 1501  although i didnt like the color of the whirlpool tub  in the master suite bathroom magenta   thats cosmetic  if they want to make the sale  they should have some amount of couth to change the color  i know its such a tiny point to harp on  maybe youre right maybe we should just keep looking  we shouldnt settle for just anything  and you think that there will be some new open houses this sunday   im sorry what were you saying  were gonna keep looking   youll take us around again on sunday  definitely   okay then see you sunday early  great  thank you  ill see you then  you are a child you know that   what do you want  dinner and a

kind of without you knowing that hes doing it  yeah i know what you mean  he said that you would be by today to talk about the clubs  about some girls russian   or from that part of the world  the ones on the circuit yeah  you should try this place called nightshift down off of holabird  i have a friend who works there  she worked with a bunch of russian girls last year for about three months   think shell talk to me  only if i ask her  thank you detective nothing further   anything more on redirect miss nathan  no your honor  lets take 10 minutes and then run the closing arguments  i have every intention of beginning tomorrow  with jury instructions   howd omar do  you didnt see it  not the cross that bad   you have no problem  no  to start he wants you to pay 5400 then we talk   he says no you pay just the 2700  yeah i saw how you talked  but you will not pay the 2700  instead you will get the money for the car that burned   yeah  yeah  him we dont know but the one he calls boss him we know  you gonna sit there and pout  i know you dont think im going down to that club just to look at pussy  i know you know me better than that   i aint even looking  everybodys looking   most of them women are dykes  cheryl its police work  what so thats supposed to make me feel better  kimas out on the street doing her detective thing  all that hospital shit all that rehab   all them promises  we talked about this  no you talked  i didnt get a word in edgewise once you made up your mind   where you going  with you  excuse me  who knows i might see a little something i happen to like  so all of thats on the table  theres money in the transport budget for the grain pier  also a bond issue that pays for maintenance dredging  on the main shipping channel   but not the canal  nope not the canal  for that well have to fight a little longer and dig a little deeper  so says frank  i gotta say for my money were lucky if we pull out the grain pier  be that as it may we spent the money and took our best shot  hired a couple lobbyists made some smart contributions  paid for a consultants report  to argue against some of the environmental stuff  it cost but were starting to see it   so where yall find the cash  ive been robbing liquor stores two a week  seriously  we got some help from the national office on this  thereve been some timely donations from a few friends here and there  the point is at the very least  were likely to see the grain pier back up by next year  which means a couple hundred more ships a year at least   if  and its a big fucking if   if that polack motherfucker  hey  no offense  if krawczyk dont fuck us by throwing up waterfront condominiums first right  nats right the back door threat is that andy kraw or some other developer  gets enough lastminute votes to sink the rehab money for the grain pier  those guys are looking at that location too  so we need everybody making phone calls  let your legislators know that were watching on this  the money only goes so far now we gotta make some noise right   make some noise  okay enough talk  some of youse got ships to work in the morning   the rest of youse need to be drunk  ill drink to that  help from the national office huh timely donations from friends  watch your ass frank   this is it  yeah  just picked it up from the port administrator  so what am i looking at  the atlantic light on the day the can with the women was offloaded  the boxes are containers  this ones being offloaded and set on a chassis  heres the time 1031 hours  see it was moved to lane l stack 6 row 3  by an rtg at 1037 hours   rtg  rubber tire gantry  so from ship to stack took six minutes  thats the way its supposed to work but  aqqz as in zebra  396594  check digit seven  thats the container number of the can with the women in it  see that it was never entered by the checker  so as far as the computer is concerned it no longer exists  sobotka says that that can happen when the radio waves get knocked down  or when a checker inputs a bad serial number  it came off atlantic light at 1126 hours  and it doesnt show up in the computer again until 1512 hours  i find it two hours after that  so for nearly four hours its out on the docks unaccounted for  sobotka says cans get lost all the time  when they get found they get put back into the computer  you believe him  no not this can  so whats the plan  the database on this computer  has records for every ship that berthed at patapsco  over the last two years  we gotta go back through and find what other cans  mightve disappeared like that   see if theres a pattern  how many ships we talking about  hundreds  it aint like i got a prayer of bringing this case in otherwise   thats what im talking about  all right   what the hell is your problem  nothing  yeah you look like you about to be sick or something  i just cant look at them  prez you aint never been to a titty bar  yeah sure but not with women  youre sure youre not gonna have a problem for talking to us  i dont give a shit you friends with shardene all that matters  besides im from westport and i told them club owners straightup  i was here before them hos got here  and they better make sure im here after they leave   so how long ago did they came through  six months back was the last batch  russians i think but shit all sound the same  when you cant understand a damn word right   who brought them  club owner pays extra for them  there was a woman  she was like the madam who handled the cash   but i aint get a name  she russian too  she was something she had an accent  so its like one day all baltimore girls are at the bar  and the next what   all foreign girls  that about right  they was making so much money with them new girls  they let some of their regular dancers go  not me cause i mean i got clientele here   but some of the others  whered the girls stay  where they told shit they aint here legally they dont know shit  they aint got no family  the men they got handling them are always with them  right there to take them from whatever motel they use  to the club and back  right there when they need to get food or go to the rite aid  right outside the motel door when they up in them rooms with the johns  anyone try to get away  shit i seen one of them get lit up with one of them stun guns  for going down the block to get some dinner  they barely let them girls go to the bathroom by themselves  and if they see one getting too close to the johns  thats when they move the whole crew to another town  keep it so they dont get no help  you up after the next song  push my numbers then i gotta go get paid honey  you need anything else you can call me help if i can  ill tell shardene you said hi  she must be doing good to be out for so long  she mustve landed a rich one right   you her girl  yeah  i wouldnt let mine come in here either without me  these bitches in here are no joke  thirteen of them  they had about a third of that space hidden behind the fake wall  a few flashlights some junk food some water  a portable toilet they had to share  and not enough air  im going to schedule sentencing for the third week of next month  anything else today  your honor my client having preserved the necessary grounds  for appeal in the record wishes me to state unequivocally  that regardless of this jurys verdict  he is the victim of wholesale perjury on the part of the states key witness  we ask that an appeal bond be set  so that he can participate fully in this investigation  an appeal bond on a conviction of firstdegree murder   mr levy get a grip on yourself  your honor  not only will there be no bond pending sentencing  but as far as im concerned  the presentencing report is a mere formality  mr hilton has been found guilty of killing a states witness  who testified in this very courtroom  he did so in cold blood and for pay  unless the presentence report indicates that he is in fact  the messiah come again  he will very likely be sentenced to life no parole  by a baltimore judge who for once in his life  gets to leave his office feeling that his job actually matters  mr hilton are you the second coming of our savior   excuse me  are you jesus christ come back to earth  see you at sentencing  was it good for you too  mr little this is good to getoutofjailfree one time only  on anything up to aggravated assault   why thank you maam  no thank you  a rare pleasure  time for the ceremonial eyefuck  come see me down the cut you punkass snitch  ill shove a shiv down your cocksucking throat  you think on it bird  you think on brandon while you doing that time  im gonna see you man i swear to god fuck that ill do you like a dog  you really see him shoot the man  you really asking  but its fucked because the man got to where he needed to be  and she wasnt even worth it  daisy wasnt nothing past any other bitch anyway you know  and he did all that for her and in the end it aint amount to shit  fitzgerald said that there were no second acts in american lives   do you believe that  man shit we locked up  we best not believe that right  hes saying that the past is always with us  and where we come from what we go through  how we go through it all that shit matters   i mean thats what i thought he meant  go ahead  like at the end of the book you know boats and tides and all  its like you can change up right  you can say youre somebody new you can give yourself a whole new story  but what came first is who you really are  and what happened before is what really happened  and it dont matter that some fool say he different  cause the only thing that can make you different  is what you really do or what you really go through  like you know like all them books in his library  now he fronting with all them books  but if we pull one down off the shelf aint none of the pages ever been opened  he got all them books and he aint read near one of them  gatsby he was who he was and he did what he did  and cause he wasnt ready to get real with the story  that shit caught up to him  i think anyway  sorry homey  you done with your trial   all right then

detective  no im good  the point is we have a pattern here  what theyre doing eliminates almost all of the paper trail  as long as they can get a truck past the outbound lanes  and theres a dozen ways to do that the only thing they leave behind  is a little telltale in the computer  a box comes off the ship flashes for a few moments and blip  then its gone  our target is supposed to be sobotka
