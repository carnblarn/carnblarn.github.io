wouldnt last him past lunch  its kilos were on the main stem   what was coming and going last night  not much  no trucks in some cars in and out  but none of the drug players we saw rolling up there before  whatever was in that last truckload probably went out in car trunks  theyre doing their distribution somewhere else for now  which is why job one is to get back to a good phone  the same pc that got you on that warehouse phone  will get you anywhere else you want to go  all we need is the new number  verizon running any new lines in there lately  we talked to the phone security people they say no  probably going to a cellphone  best bet is to get the new number off the russians cellphone  okay then  freamon and prez stay on one shift in the wiretap room  bunk and russell man the other  herc and carver you guys are on newkirk street  waiting to see if the warehouse traffic picks back up  mcnulty and greggs have a line into the prostitution ring  but so far the people handling the girls  have been a little cautious about fresh johns  so were gonna need a new angle there  questions  what was your play with those girls  outoftown salesman   how far out of town  what do you mean  the farther out of town the more they believe  less like a cop you sound  you do any accents  english british scottish something like that  crikey  i was looking to get a little hankypanky  and this one bloke gave me this number to call when i got across the pond  work on it son  200000  that isnt a quarter of what they owe  they say they will pay another 200000 once their shipment clears the docks   and then  that is all  these colombians are without honor spiros  they are cheats   the chemicals we sent are good no  no complaint  they say they want more even  and they understand that we can guarantee their product gonna clear customs  right   and still they try to chisel  why  what are they thinking  that it is all profit for us  that we will settle for half of what we agreed  because 400000 is still a lot of money  the greek will be angry  this is business eton  the greek he will be smart  jesus  you accidentally shoot one 9yearold in his bedroom  and the whole city gets its undies in a bunch  to err is human thats what i like to say  the mayor went to the scene for the cameras last night  said the crime will not stand  tell the mayor were still working without an eyeball witness  how about the street talk  i got some mentions of a 17yearold with the streetname bodie  narcotics has him as preston broadus  and why is young preston not being hurled with great abandon  around one of our interrogation rooms  we got cars on his grandmas as we speak  what the fuck you think youre dealing with here amateurs  fuck nick this is my thing  you want in you gotta deal with me  all right i got sclass and slclass benzes  roadsters sedans cabriolets  i got them brand new with the keys in the ignition  nothing stripped   off the docks  no shit off the docks  what the fuck do i look like a fucking car dealer  twenty on the dollar  but if were gonna do this im gonna need you to order a minimum of three  or else it aint worth it for me  now base price on an s430 starts at 73000  you round it i get 15000 for each car that you want  a stolen car is a stolen car  without title who is going to pay even 10000 for it  sure in baltimore maybe but where youre from  ill bet you got family that dont give two fucks  whether or not an american car got a title on it  man it would be a sad state of affairs  if an international entrepreneur such as yourself  didnt know what to do with a couple of extra mercedes  big night for jimmy mcnulty  or should i say james cromwell of knightsbridge  stepney and mersey  excuse me  cromwell was the english fuck who stole my ancestors land  and the other ones are all from rock n roll songs  anyways 1000 tomorrow night  the shuttle comes for me on the parking lot off russell street  good work  well get greggs to wire you

women were local  they were  no fbi  weve been running only clean containers  yes and no one watches no one follows  no one stops anything  and we changed the warehouse phone  a day or two more and we are back to business  we watch we are careful but we are back to business  you will have to do a favor for our friend no  fair is fair  the colombians i think  they take our chemicals and pay less than promised  down there i understand everyone is a terrorist now  judges are killed bombs go off in the street its very bad  the colombians who cheated us theyre not with the guerrillas  theyre

federal officials have confirmed to channel 6 news  that their investigation is ongoing  and that while no arrests have yet been made  the seizure itself has severely disrupted the operations of a group  believed to have ties to colombian narcoterrorist  now that gentlemen is a case  god forbid you two should put something like that on my friend frank sobotka  i would die happy  our case is progressing   great what can you charge  were not at that point  weve got wires into a smuggling operation that weve linked to drugs and women  likely theyre the people who were bringing in the girls  who turned up dead in that can two months ago  now were on one location that we believe is a transshipment point for narcotics  and last night if you check the 24s  youll see that we hit a brothel we also think ties in  a month or two more on the taps and dnrs  and we will be able to identify the topend players   you hit a brothel  waterfront condo highend  jesus  if you find anything that looks like a list of steady customers flush it  i mean half the names in the maryland manual are probably on it  any problems on the raid  a complication or two nothing we cant write around  immigration is holding the girls  and the madam who has legal residency we cut loose after she posted bail  you try to interview them see if any will roll  not while the taps are up  better to let them think it was a random raid and see whats said on the wire today  cut to the chase you any closer on my murders  if these are the people who were importing those girls  then yeah were closer  the more we learn the more chance we have to clear those cases  what about frank sobotka  im not hearing his name in here anywhere  the union may be involved in the smuggling  but were not getting a sense that it goes past that  this is about frank sobotka  the case is bigger now  look missy this is my detail i started it  now im asking do you have charges on frank sobotka  charging sobotka at this point would lose us the wire  and a chance at the real targets   he is the real target  patience stan   im sure if they bring the case  you owe me on this erv  you asked for a detail i gave you a detail  you asked for daniels i gave you daniels  okay  now the votes are in  and youre moving your damn golf trophies upstairs to the commissioners office  now youre freezing me out huh  fucking rat fuckers all of you  this is my case  mine  and now youre gonna tell me who the target is  not fucking likely  hes saying no  hes saying we fought for every one of them towers  and to give them up now would mark us as weak  hes saying if we do this prop joe would have it over us  and we might never get out from under   we dont have the product or the muscle  i told him  i did  he say he still trying to find us a better connect  and for muscle  hes saying he sending us the best he can find  brother mouzone  he sending in brother  from new york  coming down to work on retainer for as long as we need   brother mouzone  yep  at which point the officer was unable to resist  the ministrations of the aforementioned suspect  and found himself brought to the point of a sexual act  youre famous behind this you know that  as a pervert this report is gonna make you a bpd legend  i cant perjure myself i gotta explain it somehow  motherfucker you have violated a half dozen departmental regs right there  not to mention that no states attorney is gonna even bring this thing into court  were not going to court the girls are being deported  we did the raid just to tickle the wire remember  there were two of them i was outnumbered  you fucking with me right  brother mouzone from nyc  i went to avon told him i didnt have enough muscle to hold down them towers   played it like that  yeah and he reached out  joe im still holding on to this deal  know what im saying this is just some shit we gotta deal with  deal with how  my nigger i would take the motherfucker out if i could  but avon cant know it came from his own people right  you dont think im gonna send any of my people up against brother  shit  that nigger got more bodies on him than a chinese cemetery  true  look im just saying this your problem not mine  you want my product you need to deal with it  all right so listen we got some time here  avon gotta send up word and wait for word to come back  set up a price talk to brother
