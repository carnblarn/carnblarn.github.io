the ministers will see the wisdom of new leadership  except yall need to get a pay raise through the city council  pay raise would help  i can ask nerese about that pay raise getting passed  maybe convince some of the ministers  they need to move on from burrell  situation would have to be resolved sooner rather than later  do my best partner  and what do we do for you in return  im in annapolis  word im hearing you may be there too in a couple of years  we may find ourselves working together closely  thanks for your time  jesus christ  hes slick  apologizes for the short con  and

yet  who caught the last one mcnulty  working it we should talk   all right  speaking of arrests  word from on high is to sweep corners  they want arrests to double over the next month  jesus i thought the election was over  bosses want qualityoflife violations  what are we talking about lieutenant loitering  disorderlies public indecency  oh this is horse shit   broken windows theory  worked in new york  case you aint noticed this aint new york  but it could work here   never has  never been done right   open containers too  whats wrong with writing a ticket  gonna be doing more of

was his business  you took them to a restaurant  yeah ruths chris  linen napkins  yeah silverware more than one fork  howd they do  eh pretty well considering  did they embarrass us  us no were fine with it but  i mean they were intimidated embarrassed  and awkward as hell  but they made it through  ms shepherdson these arent the kids  that are gonna be able to sit still for the statewide tests  much less do well on them  these kids are gonna make it impossible for anyone else to do well  so were writing them off  no thats what were not doing  youre not educating them youre socializing them  they werent being educated before  theres no point in being obtuse   excuse me  hold on hold on  look what hes saying is this  i mean you put a textbook in front of these kids  put a problem on a blackboard or  teach them every problem on some statewide test  it wont matter none of it  cause theyre not learning for our world theyre learning for theirs  they know exactly what it is theyre training for  and what it is everyone expects them to be  i expect them to be students  but its not about you or us or the tests or the system  its what they expect of themselves  i mean every single one of them know they headed back to the corners  their brothers and sisters shit their parents  they came through these same classrooms didnt they  we pretended to teach them they pretended to learn  and where whered they end up  same damn corners  i mean theyre not fools these kids  they dont know our world but they know their own  i mean jesus they  they see right through us  i think we made that clear when you approved the project  provisionally approved  when you provisionally approved the project  we made it clear that we would be addressing children  that required socialization  before they could be properly educated  we cant lie  not to them  captain line 3  roll calls over  you get a line on your mother yet  fucking neglect case here i want it  how about that aunt  aint

on it  no thank you  what i saw today  wasnt education as i understand the term  and they didnt seem very socialized either  you didnt catch us on our best day  or your worst day  on the whole theyve actually made a lot of progress  i mean they come to class theyre more engaged  were reaching them  fewer outbursts no suspensions  but are they really learning anything  yes we believe they are  be truthful  if this program were to continue  trough the rest of the school year  how many of your students could realistically  be expected to return to a regular classroom  what do you think ms duquette  namond darnell maybe zenobia  look considering where we started and considering that those kids  aint out there tearing up other classes  mrs donnelly  a tremendous achievement  mr withers  ill go along with mrs donnelly  you havent said anything yet  i just dont see it  many of these kids are profoundly damaged  what theyve seen how theyve lived  and i think any gain or progress is temporary  i think this project may be flawed  foxtrot 2330  we have a visual on the suspect vehicle headed east on mulberry  do you copy    after your phone call  i checked it came directly from burrell  he bypassed rawls after i specifically told him he was  burrells making a play for you to keep him  by uh just what did you call that  juking the stats  guy is unbelievable  it runs completely counter to all my discussions with rawls  with you with everyone  hes also serving notice  hes reasserting control of the department  he probably figures if you cant fire him then you cant fire him  and does rawls know  my guess is rawls heard about it days ago  from half a dozen district commanders  why wouldnt he come to me  talk to him  why did you come to me  i mean why not go to rawls  because i need to know if youre serious  if rawls already came to you and this shit is still going on  then youre ok with it which is for me a problem  if he didnt come to you  then either hes ok with it which is also a problem  or hes letting it go trying give burrell enough rope  for you to get angry and fire the man for insubordination  but i need to know where you stand  well i gave you my word  yes you did  well thanks for going outside the chain of command  dont expect me to make a habit of it  stay in the car  stay in the car keep your hands on the wheel   lets see those hands  whats the problem officer  step slowly out of the vehicle keep your hands up  son be gentler than that  fuck up i aint your son  this guy  whats this huh whats this  do you know what  im gonna damn

this is the last man we want as police commissioner nerese  i mean i squared off against this fellow a few years back  and he wouldnt listen to me  hes not gonna listen to you or the ministers  or anyone else in the community  just carcetti  oh hes the mayors boy definitely  carcetti is looking for how much of a salary bump   to make the position competitive nationally  give him 25  itll be enough to make him think hell win you over eventually  but less than he needs to entice anyone real  meanwhile carcettis gonna have to give daniels  before he can bump him again  for appearances sake  so were buying time here  enough for ervin to show the new mayor who butters the bread  and for events to take the new penny shine off cedric daniels  i happen to know hes less the saint than he pretends to be  this is senator davis is the mayor in at the moment  well you just tell him his friend clay  got the council president to unass a salary bump for the police commissioner  you tell him  write this down now  you tell him that senator davis has his interests at heart  right  thanks  hey ma how was new york  hey ms brice how are you  who asking  this is my teacher mom mr colvin  why he
