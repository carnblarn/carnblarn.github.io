youre arrogant and disloyal  but maybe given time youll find a way to shine   whats the detail  drug case probably  my sense of it is that stan valchek has got  some personal issues with somebody in one of the port unions  he thinks theyve got too much money  and so being valchek he gets a detail  that it pretty thin  i dont care if you make a case for valchek or not  i do care that the old polack comes away from it  feeling he got his moneys worth  valchek asked for me by name didnt he  you two are trading horses and you need me in the corral  how about this  if i bring in the case  you make the detail permanent as a major case unit  within cid  fair enough  just keep valchek stroked and make sure you bring in   a drug case or two  one other thing  a promotion and the promise of a specialized unit isnt enough  i choose my own people  fuck me once shame on you   fuck me twice  make a list  give it to rawls hell pull who you want  the shit do not make sense some of them wasnt

basement  theyre decent people   we aint got time  i know   so why you grabbing  they were staring right at me  ill meet you out back  so how do you get the container off the ship off the dock  i guess if you wanted to make sure your cargo  isnt messed with youd want to get with one of the checkers   who are they  local 1514  they monitor all the loading and offloading  they match the manifests they tally the cargo  nothing goes in or out without them putting it down somewhere   or not  or not  so we need to talk to a checker  what  black white polish irish italian it doesnt matter  no one talks to police  how do you make a case then  i patrol  i write traffic tickets  if we got an open container or a damaged container  i take a report  we got something stolen i take another report  someone gets something dropped on him or gets run over by a frontend loader   i keep writing  thats the job  how long you been on   two years  what did you do before that  i took tolls from people at the fort mchenry tunnel  which im happy to say wasnt nearly as much fun  made 22500 and went home tired every night  until i walked by the office bulletin board one night  read the mdot job posting  port authority officers schedule one starting at 33000 with benefits  tolltaking days were over  father of my two kids went to houston in 99  hasnt so much as called in three years  i wasnt gonna make it on 22500  not with kids i wasnt  did you want to be a police   couldve been me the other night  true  except for all of a sudden you up and tell me to stop doing that  avon to the rescue how did you know  i figured you were gonna be bringing your ass in here  to thank me for pulling you off of that shit  five dead more in the infirmary   how did you know  i did as your uncle should  because im concerned about you fucking yourself up  you knew  look man i aint had nothing to do with it  i might know who did though  you practically running this place who else could it be  it aint about what happened you understand  its about using what happened to our advantage  play or you gonna get played  i need to know that you aint do that shit  thats what i need to know  i already said it you aint gonna believe it fuck it  you can tell yourself that i spiked it but be grateful that you still standing  once you done with all that  we can talk about how we start shaving some of these years off  and not just for me for you too  they looking for the motherfucker who brought that shit in here  they need him to fall and you know what  i can give you a name i can give you the right name  we can take that name down to the assistant warden  and we can get some of our lives back  you dig  so stay close  this play on the inside this play on the outside  we got it all covered  i dont want no part of what you do no more you hear me  so you can just leave me the fuck out of that  whatever it is  anyone seen omar  were back in  six ships in one day  aint seen the terminal this busy in months feels sweet  shit look at this pretty bitch   what the fuck are you wearing  italian leather all right  in the middle of winter on the goddamn docks   how much does that shit cost  2000  for a goddamn jacket are you out your fucking mind zig  fuck it  2000 for a single goddamn jacket  jesus zig you need therapy and shit  i figured an africanamerican such as yourself would understand  how a player such as myself needs to take heed in the latest fashion  but apparently you aint got no fucking style neither   im gonna walk all right  see you  what  what did i tell you about not spreading no cash around  jesus christ nicky its a fucking coat  i can tell people im paying for it on installments or whatever  but you got to admit i do look pretty today  i do  the greeks wanna talk to us  what about  we did good by them  yeah  but for christ sakes zig keep your shit quiet  before half the fucking waterfronts talking about us  all right no problem   all right see you later  see you  yo quit it  gentlemen  we dont need that now   say what  i dont give a shit about drugs  littering pisses me off though you can pick that up when im gone  im looking for a stickup boy name of omar  darkskinned thin guy with a scar right down his face  you boys would definitely know him if you saw him  because hes got a shotgun about yealong  hell put it to your head and steal your shit without thinking twice  does anyone know where he hangs  who hes running with  what hes driving  fuck you officer  the second package came even weaker than the last  it wont take the cut like it did before  fucking atlanta shit cost more and still not as good  came in at 25  all we can do is sprinkle it and bag it  and lose my money  i lose my money  step on that motherfucker  how hard  make it 10   its shit now  i know  so the container itself leads us nowhere fake addresses on either end  which leaves us the port itself  because whatever went wrong on that ship was known to whoever  was supposed to pick that container up  which is why it stays on the dock  bottom line is we need to know more about cargo moving off that terminal  how to do dirt and how to hide when youre doing dirt  bottom line for me is different  bottom line for me is you guys shouldve held that ship  for your crime scene for your witnesses for the whole damn case  sir the witnesses  i dont care if they were speaking mandarin chinese  with a cocksuckers lisp  they needed to see the inside of an interrogation room they were the case  we were in philadelphia with no real jurisdiction  dealing with foreign nationals and no real probable cause  i can only tell you what it looks like from where i sit  and from here the view is two of my detectives fucking the dog  thirteen homicides 14 if we connect the floater and all of them red  so what can i tell you  if this case doesnt fall were all gonna be stepping on our dicks  trying to explain what happened  so work it as you see fit  but understand  if i have to throw burrell a scapegoat or two  i got one to throw  fuck me  what did you want to talk to us about  if you are able to do like you did we have other things we can use  like what  fact is we shook things up down there snatching all them cameras  it comes to expensive shit like that we got to lay back for a while  stuff we need is not like that  no  acetone sulfuric acid potassium permanganate   chemicals  its like paint thinner shit like that  what do you need with those just go get them at the hardware store  no we need much  metric tons five or ten tons  check and youll see they make these things here  send them from here tanks and tanks down at your docks  good money for those  how much  how much chemical two tons four   eight  ill look into it  yo bubbles  mcnulty  my meanest man  get in the car  where you been at brother  what did you get walkman  you know how it works bubs youre going to pay taxes on this shit  taxation without representation you know  i dont want much i need omar  wild omar  you want us to wander around town  looking for a crazy motherfucker with a shotgun  him and me go way back its a friendly thing  if hes a friend you can find the motherfucker without us  no problem show me the receipt for this shit youre off the hook   here  keep it part of my tax  your tax is omar  i need a line by friday bubs  fuck  my client will provide accurate information as to the source of the tainted narcotics  he can identify the method by which contraband is smuggled  into this institution as well as the people responsible  cellblock talk is cheap  hell give you what you need to make a case   if thats what youre interested in  your terms  mr barksdale is due for a first parole hearing at 28 months  wed like to trim that to a year  and have your assurances of institutional support  for work release and early parole  one year on a sevenyear bit  we are offering extraordinary cooperation in this matter  mr barksdales placing himself at risk  by offering information implicating other prisoners  and staff at mci  and i would only add that mr barksdales extant conviction is his first  he has no priors whatsoever  its my recollection that a city police got shot behind mr barksdales business   no sir  you dont remember that  i remember the officer got shot  and i remember being upset about that not only because the officer got shot  but because i knew it meant there was gonna be more police on me  i remember thinking any time any fool do something like shoot a police  its bad on everyone  i know that you know that my name aint nowhere  on what happened to your friend  i think what were asking is reasonable under the circumstances  after all until someone identifies the source of the tainted heroin  you could have another five overdoses tomorrow  or the day after  consider the offer  but the next time we talk  an assistant attorney general has to be in the room  tuna surprise  christ sakes ma i climbed all over two ships today  how

agreed the price of cooperation is an agreement by the state parole officials  to move mr barksdales first parole hearing forward by 12 months  and to credit him in the file with cooperation in this matter  you cant make a case on just some cons say so  we need the dope on the table  of course you do  if before the end of business today you effect a search  of correctional officer tilghmans vehicle locker and person  we are confident sufficient evidence will be recovered  we are confident  as far as doc is concerned this is a fair deal  if it takes the overdoses off our plate  but if we
