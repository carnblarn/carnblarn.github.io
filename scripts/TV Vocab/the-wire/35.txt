                you need another bag  yo mike where you at  yeah over here  drug war  barksdals coming back on my boy marlo hmm  shit  got it  yo man i dont know where we at  we are in baltimore lamar  baltimore maryland  thats the second crib of mine them motherfuckers cracked this week  stir up a hornets nest  no tellin who gonna get stung  all paranoid an shit  got to be  they got latroy  what the fuck is yall on the streets for man  dont you all know theres a fucking war going on man  get the fuck in the truck man  what happened to all them towers  slow train comin  reform lamar  reform  reformation  we should be up on this shit hearin voices  we get a signature number on bodies phone we will be  we got enough pc off the burners alone  every time these fucking pen registers click out a call  it screams drug conspiracy  im not the one takin the case to court  pearlman wants a specific link to a known drug trafficker  these drug crews  theyre dumping phones every couple weeks at best  so when we do get a wire up its gonna be a limited run  and dumping phones doesnt meet the cellular companys  definition of exigent circumstance huh  whats your boss willing to do  demper  hes a bit too focused on next years reelection fight  how about the feds  they say they cant do anything for us  and if you look at how they use the federal communications act  theyre not lying  for national security stuff they use the patriot act  every thing else gets shorted  the fact is the industry has all of us by the balls  pardon my french your honor  alright ill tell you what  best i can do for you is this  you give me a boilerplate affidavit with the pc from the court report  and then as you get fresh numbers for new disposables  you call me  anytime day or night to jump phones  that helps  but were still gonna be getting up  on their phones even as theyre coming down  yeah probably so   this is so totally  fucked up  je parle franais bien et tu es trs charmant aujourdhui   judge phelan has you on his mind  how long has that been going on  started with  my first jury trial in his court i think  i bet you won all your motions  you wanted to see me sir  have a seat  i wanna thank you for the loyalty you showed  moving that body  it wasnt the most sensible thing but  i appreciate it nonetheless  youre a good man sergeant  you got good instincts  and as far as i can tell youre a decent supervisor  but from where i sit  you aint shit when it come to policin  dont take it personal aint just you  its all our young police  a whole generation of yall  now you think about it  you been here over a year now carver  you got nobody looking out for you  nobody willing to talk to you  that about sum it up  and thats a problem  and i didnt think there was anyway  i was ever gonna get my head around it  but then dozerman gets shot for some bullshit  and thats when i bout reach my limit  and thats when the idea of the free zone  of hamsterdam come to me  because this drug thing this aint police work  no it aint  i mean i can send any fool with a badge and a gun  up on those corners and jack a crew and grab vials  but policing  you call something a war and pretty soon  everybody gonna running around acting like warriors  they gonna be runnin around on a damn crusade  stormin corners slappin on cuffs rackin up body counts  and when you at war you need a fuckin enemy  and pretty soon  damn near everybody on every corner is your fuckin enemy  and soon the neighborhood that youre supposed to be policin  thats just occupied territory  you follow this  i think so  look the point im makin carver is this  soldierin and policin they aint the same thing  and before we went and took the wrong turn  and started with these war games  the cop walked a beat and he learned that post  and if there were things that happened up on that post  whether there be a rape a robbery a shooting  he had people out there helping him feeding him information  but every time i come to you my deu sergeant  for information  to find out whats going on out there on them streets  all that came back was some bullshit  you had your stats you had your arrests you had your seizures  but dont none of that amount to shit when you talking about  protecting a neighborhood now do it  you know the worst thing about this  so called drug war  to my mind  it just ruined this job  major  what do you got  incoming  sunpapers reporter  been to the free zones all three of em  its begun  i was thinkin maybe we rewrite the affidavit  add some of the stuff were gettin from the pen registers  build the case that way take it to the judge  you have a law degree  if you did it would be your call to make  who would pretend to be a lawyer that wasnt  im just saying  i think were being too cautious on this  were going the extra mile for phelan  a short cut now could cost us later in motions hearings  we drew phelan on this wiretap  that twofaced hack sold me out the last goround  relax  hes not running for a new term hell be fine  hes a piece of shit  were all pieces of shit when were in your way  that goes with the territory  point taken  so its these warehouses  the old winchester homes and the dead blocks down by vincent street  all three  and theyre just supposed to let it go on like this  colvin told us to push the street dealing in these areas  then we would start locking people up  but so far not a single fucking arrest  and they know about this downtown  i dont think they have a fucking clue about it  but id love to be there when you pop the question  this is just  tell me about it  got the place lookin good  yeah  now all needs doin is to go out and get you some kids  come on man  you makin it sound easy  but to tell you the truth  i aint got no idea how to go at these hoppers  i wouldnt lose any sleep over that  nobody else does neither  we got one  his grandmother  looking for me  look boy theres no reason to leave your clothes in the washer   how many damn times do i have to tell you   gag grandma sorry i just forgot okay  but i did pick up the laundry soap i picked it up   laundry soap thats definitely code  now lets listen to an intercept we made of bodie broadus  when we were up on the pay phones a couple years back  im tellin ya all  i saw the boy he sayin he aint got that thing   same voice no question  ill let the judge know  reference the voice comparison in the court report  were up  major colvin western district  banisky sunpapers  so this your idea  mind if we walk  you got dealers selling with impunity  addicts shooting up on the street  people down here doing outreach giving out needles and all  i mean who knows about this down at headquarters  command is well aware of the situation  and while there were some initial concern  but they feel the cases that were gonna bring in  cases  yeah prosecutions sure  your officers say no ones being locked up in the free zones  my troops are only involved in pushing the trafficking  to designated areas  i mean theyre completely ignorant of the investigative aspect  thats run out of cid downtown  yeah  whos the lead detective  look  i already said more than i should  bottom line is you start throwing calls around right now  they gonna shit blue thinking theres a leak  they gonna come up on the case early  and were not gonna get all we can out of the good work  we did down here  youre telling me all this is an enforcement strategy  what the hell else could it be  i mean you think wed actually let this happen otherwise  come on banisky  i mean look look at this mess  any other reporter gets on it  i give it to you and you run with it right then  absolutely  a week  but then i gotta run something no matter what  purple rain purple rain   its understood  so brother what brought you back  it disturbs me to leave business unfinished  heard you was shot before you even got started down here  not like you to get played  betrayed you mean  i am looking for the man they

here  one thing were gonna need is black faces  and were gonna need them in prominent positions  youre right  weve gotta start thinking about endorsements by black leaders  ministers community people

that is riggs and calhoun  mount and fayette  edmondson and brice  its your old foot post deputy  i know where it is major  what i dont know and very much want to know is  where is the west baltimore drug trade  i hope major these are not staged photographs youre showing us  no sir they are not  no deputy i found another approach  im all ears bunny  i moved them off the corners  goddamnit dont be coy with me major i can see that  what i want to know is how the fuck you managed to move them  and where the fuck they are now  deputy  i dont know quite how to put this but we  i mean i  i began by identifying those areas of my district where  drug trafficking was least harmful  i proceeded to push all streetlevel dealing towards those areas  now at first  dealing with the juveniles on them corners had little success  but ultimately  by rounding up all the midlevel dealers in my district  and making an offer they couldnt refuse   i was able to  you made them an offer  yes sir  either they move their people to one of three designated areas  where drug enforcement was not a district priority  or they face the wrath of every ablebodied soul in my district  major i dont understand  the only time we can hold a drug corner  is when we assign officers to stand there  your slides dont suggest any concerted deployment on any corners  how were you able to  jesus christ you nit dont you see what hes done  hes legalized drugs  actually i elected to ignore them  you lost your fucking mind hes lost his fucking mind  you in my office now  thats it gentleman  shes a go  showtime bubs

you know i got my vacation time my last 30 in a couple months  so if you need me to fall im ready  but dont let me hear that youre taking  any punitive action against my people  because i can get on

illegal but stone fuckin brilliant nonetheless  after all my puttin my foot up  peoples asses to decrease the numbers he comes in  and in one stroke gets a fuckin 14 decrease  fuckin shame its gonna end our careers but still  youre all probably tired of hearin from me but  i brought these  letters  from community associations ministers business people citizens  and theyre all positive  theyre all happy that the dealers are off the corners  you think thats gonna save our asses  do you  no i guess not but  that and my badge is all i got  i might have your badge major but not today  i dont want

reporter is aware of my deployment  i told him an investigation was pending  he promised to delay the article  how long  about a week tops  i was with superstroke on the pool circuit in the early days

one two pivot  youre kidding  tell me hes kidding  youre kidding right  he did it without our knowledge  without your knowledge  well thats worse youre the commissioner  was the commissioner  you think the bucks gonna stop in this office youre wrong  if i might these are letters from people in his district  ministers business people voters  all glowing reports  and theres the 14 reduction in crime in the western  thats not an anomaly  its hard data  now we can clean it up make it go away  the press might already have wind of it  but we can explain that as some sort of a new initiative  trap highend drug dealers   if we handle this right we might all get out from underneath  no mud on anybody  no no  i trusted you erv i really did  you let me down  now this thing goes wrong no tellin the damage  on this you walk point  thats the way things work erv you know it as well as i do  thank you ervin  ill be over shortly to see the detailed plan  on how this shit gets cleaned up immediately  if you could call this shit something other than what it is  dont even think it  way it works is this  if you dont reup the minutes on your cell phone before 60 days  the wireless company recycles the phone number  and thats where i get them  i put the word out on the street that im buying tossedoff burners  payin two dollars a pop  street people bring me hundreds  i bring em in here to my niece she jiggles the computer  juices them up another 200 minutes on a bogus account  and that automatically extends the life of the phone for another 60 days  she charges me 20 on each phone on her end  i double it or more on the street to make mine  so what you sayin  baby a standard trac phone with two  maybe 400 minutes on it gonna run you 150 200 easy  i charge you an even 100 you clear 50 on each phone  thats ifin you can back them up with receipts  i gotta show receipts lookin like they from different places  or i cant play  can we accommodate the good man  damn calvin you
