this  sure  the fuck do we do now  buy this guy a box of videotapes  or camp out in this shithole for a week hoping our boy runs the same route  i just know i got to put my mind on something or im gonna slide back  need to be in control of myself you know what im sayin  take command of your life  something  cultivate some selfdiscipline  or whatever  what if i told you that theres a certain liberation  not in command or in selfcontrol  but in surrendering  well that depends on who youre surrendering to  oh that  all due respect  you can stow that patter right here and now  look it aint about me doin for me i dont think  might need to be about more than that  so youre bringing in an overall decline of two percent for the month  but if i read this correctly almost half of thats coming from  an eight percent drop in the western district  major colvin is himself willing to acknowledge  the possibility of a statistical variation from the mean  in his monthly stats  variation huh  gentlemen if i look through the western incident reports  am i likely to find less crime or more incidents  which have been downgraded or unfounded  because this kind of variation screams manipulation to me  and if im wrong about that  if indeed there is no manipulation involved  i would like to know exactly what it is that major colvin  has learned about police work that eludes the rest of your commanders  councilman i assure you these stats are not massaged  we dont do that  i dont do that  and i wont allow my people to do that  our feeling is that its genuinely an aberration  and if it repeats itself next month  then it bears closer examination otherwise  moving on to new business then how are we fixed for witness assistance  does the department have sufficient funds  to ensure pretrial security for any endangered witnesses  we have the resources that the city can afford im sure  i understand youre in no position to criticize the mayor   nor would i  nor would you  so allow me to ask the question  what is this city willing to pay to make it possible for ordinary people  to come down to the courthouse and perform the civic duty  of bearing witness against gangsters and criminals  what resources are commensurate with that kind of commitment  you can play the good soldier if you want commissioner  but i want to go on the record here  in saying that this administration has passed the buck time and again  and failed to protect those citizens who demonstrate that kind of commitment  and put their lives and livelihood at risk  and i would only like to add that i feel as my colleague does  that this administration has failed this community miserably  and we need to do something about this  yall are friends  yall like brothers  you lose that you lose every damn thing  kids messed up the good hoop  now they got one looks like the original peach basket  an they hangin onto it like a tit  i dont know  maybe i should get up some kind of tournament  you play basketball  never was much for balls and sticks  i was all about my hands  boxer  yeah  boxing  i know a place where some of the kids go but  it aint nearly close enough to here  i wouldnt mind takin a look at it  get a mental picture at least  what the hell is goin on here  police pushed all the action down here and a couple other places  the deacon thinks that maybe some people  should come in here and take over this situation  you that people  one of em maybe  roman man  dennis  you should lay back on this one  lemme go talk to buford pusser in there alone  excuse me  and what it shows people is that i know my business  that i will hold people accountable based on the facts   this is about whats right  there you go again  what  do you think politics is only about winning the argument  that whoever has the right fact at the right moment wins  clinton had facts  kennedy had facts yeah but reagan  he couldnt have summoned a fact if his life depended on it  its not just facts its how you use them  and tommy when you get hold of a fact or two  you go smartass and start beating on people   thats because  clinton and reagan  when they got up to speak  they gave everyone in the room comfort and confidence  you liked those guys  you were happy to think that they even liked you  youre saying im not likeable  jen  when youre at home talking with me  not the council not the cameras youre great  when you tell me whats really important to you  i believe  youre smart and youre ambitious  and youve got a sharper tongue than most  you can hold court and you can tell a good story  and you can win the argument if you want  all of that shows tommy  and at a baltimore city council meeting it shows well  but if you want to be mayor  or senator or governor one day  show them something more  baltimore huh  went up there to the harbor with my wife for our anniversary  charged us 12 for two beers  shit thats the least of it  the whole damn towns gone to hell in a handbasket  and guess whos running the show  who  who do you think  the department city hall the courts  shit the courts  you know what they call it when judge  jury and perp all go to the same family barbecue  catch and release  no shit  may god have mercy on any poor white boy going to trial  thats when everybodys got their ass in the air talking about justice  cant wait to throw away the key  i mean theyre not all so bad  actually theres a lot of good ones  im on the radio if you need me  my wife carol ann  some very good ones  is there anything specific i can help you with  while youre down here detective  or is this just a courtesy call  you know you should meet my partner youd like her  cant go through the front on this boy  so im thinkin were gonna have to creep around the back  get

and colvins answer is what  ride shotgun for hoppers drown them in cash money paid  colvin hes always been good police  hes got to know what a fuckin heartbreaker  it is to wake up every morning suit up for this shit  hes got to suit up too man  somebody should dime the brass about this shit  or the sun papers  let me ask you something  anybody here ever get jammed up  and not have colvin go to the wall for you  the man is trying something  it may be hard to stomach but its working  after 30 years dont you think hes earned the right  to some elbow room on this  what the fuck this thing is on borrowed time anyhow  and when we do decide to jump on the hamsterdams  theyre just gonna go back to their regular corners right  if we ever jump out on it  i dont know that were gonna  all im sayin is we give the guy the same backup  hes always given us  thats all im sayin  i swear as soon as the sun comes up we grab the damn tape and go  this place makes me want to cry  hey i spent half my

to get where i am today  now when i say i ready you best believe it  through the effective use of resources  an increased police presence  and an intensive reach out into the community  weve been able to have a significant impact on these areas  to the effect of a 12 decrease overall   cumulatively  over four weeks  major i know i gave you shit  when your stats took a jump a few weeks back  but now youre gonna shove the numbers right up my ass  its kind of pouty of you isnt it   i didnt cook em then i aint cookin em now  seriously bunny i already got the city council asking questions  about the eight percent drop you posted last week  we just want to please the mayor not go to jail behind this shit  sometimes the gods do listen sir  not in the western they dont  lieutenant daniels  sir  you want to take credit for any of this  your units been working in that district a couple of weeks  were barely up on anything  in fact the crews were looking at are still beefing  still dropping bodies  amazing  crime is down and no one wants to take any credit  what is wrong with this picture  you dont mind if i have planning and research  pull all your cc numbers  make sure theres not a decimal point missing between the one and the two  pull everything deputy  my number will stand  hey tell landsman line twentyoneohthrees for him   i called because i heard you went and visited donette  told her my sons death couldnt have been no suicide  is that right  i did do that  dangelo hung himself  not with the belt they found around his neck  not at that distance between the doorknob and the floor  so what are you saying  what am i saying  no  nobody wouldve dared  my brother his uncle would have  i agree with you  nobody wouldve dared  unless  avon and dee was family  family right  this is just you talking right  i mean anyone else saying that  nah just me  no one else cares  right  its just i dunno on the inside  if somebodys going after you  has got a beef sees red they use a shank  its quick and its over  dangelo was strangled  which is planned  you need the time you need the isolation  look im just sorry i brought this whole mess up to begin with  because frankly nobodys gonna do shit about it anyhow  whoever killed him wanted to pass it off as a suicide  and the cops are happy enough to have one less murder to investigate  on top of that the anne arundel states attorney doesnt give a fuck  im not supposed to give a fuck so  i guess your son just got squeezed between the sides  squeezed between what sides  look two years ago  we hung more wire on your brothers crew than at  and at the end dangelo was this close to flipping  giving up everybody everything  but you know all that right  you were the one who went down to that detention center  and talked your son out of a deal  i kinda liked your son you know  all things considered he was a pretty decent kid  and it grinds me that no one ever spoke up for him  and seems to me that nobody ever will  but mostly at this point  im sorry i bothered his girl and im sorry she bothered you  why go to her  why not come to me first  honestly  i was looking for somebody who cared about the kid  i mean like i said  you were the one how made him take the years right  red leader to red boys   red two come in   cheese steak has a problem bitch   save me some fries yo  you want fries   i suggest you bring some cash

youre gonna need a little help with the cleanup  ill piece that together  this my trip man  need to go from a to b all by my self   am i likely to find less crime  or more incidents that have been downgraded or unfounded  because this kind of variation screams manipulation to me   slow your words  indeed there is no manipulation involved   try to lock your eyes on whoever you talk to  make them
