or some shit  we could stick condoms on his car  thatd send a message  yeah but what kind  we should slap bumper stickers on his windshield  i mean they is hard to get off  hold on wait wait  do officer walker go to that club on stockton  the one where the western police party  i seen his car there  i got this one   and as much as i empathize  i can only tell you that there is a process  for complaints like this one  dont sell us on process mr mayor  weve had years of this kind of treatment from city police  you need to understand we do this as an affront to the cloth  weve asked for a civilian review board  for decades now  absent that how can we trust  any investigation of any complaint  forgive me gentlemen  but last i checked  the department had a black commissioner  and a black iid director  the problem is systemic  and as to commissioner burrell  we understand that his authority is now limited  mr mayor when it comes to matters like this one  do you expect us to have faith in deputy rawls  i expect youll be good enough  not to prejudge the departments response  before the investigation even begins  as i wont prejudge it  i can only tell you that i take this incident  very seriously and that i will pursue all of the facts  well mr mayor  you said you would have an open door  and so far i credit you for keeping that promise  and my door will always be open to you  thank you  if they couldnt get civilian review in royce administration  how can they think theyll get it from me  theyre just testing you here  trying to see how vulnerable you feel on the racial stuff  on burrell too for what its worth  well civilian review is a nonstarter  you go now there now  youll be bending over for 4 years for the ministers  so what i throw them a bone and fire some idiot cop  by pressing that the average beat cops  gonna hate my guts and i aint gonna change  anything around without rankandfile support  you dont fire him youre going to piss off  most of the black political infrastructure  yummy my first bowl of shit  circle that right  and you press that right there  its work time  you guys got work to do you write down that data   yeah  all right  charlene what dont you understand  none of it  ok lets see if we can find a way you can get it ok  whats the diameter   its 7  good  ok whats half of that  you cant take half of it  ok lets say you have 10 and you gave half of it to jasmine  why i do that  well just pretend ok  you give her half how much does she have   duh 5  good  now lets say this time you have 7  and you give her half how much does she have  350  good so  yo mr prez  check this out  why we no pick him up at his casa  follow him from there  why so we can lose him here again  papa nothin say he got to come back through this way you know  what if he take another road  all right we pick him up from his casa tomorrow  talk   dont pout  omar  im tired of this bro  lo siento baby lo siento  hey now  there she blow  all right then  so we agree staring down  a stickup boy on a corner takes courage  and we agree it takes courage to go overnight  to cheltenham or hickey  this is a good list  but are there any examples we can make  outside of being on a corner  i need a volunteer  not me  what about you albert  no  you volunteer and you dont know what for  you aint got brains  all right then i need a volunteer to stand on this box  blindfolded fall off and let us catch him  before he hits the ground   albert  thats fucking stupid  what about you namond  wait wait let me get this right  so you want me to stand up on that box  put a blindfold on fall  and expect these weakass clowns to catch me  hell no  who you talkin to  for real  yeah for real  hey yo yall drop me and we gonna have more than words  aight  all right everybody gather around  oh shit  you ready on 3   shit oh that st was right  all right who wants to go next  albert  i aint doing no stupid shit like that  fuck you and fuck all yall bitches  we dont

renaldo whats wrong yo  no no i mean go  we been in the car too many hours  whether you squat in an alley or sittin on a porcelain throne  dont really change the moment now do it  rough day  doesnt help to hold it in  what the fuck you know  if you tell me maybe we can help  aint nothing  look come on albert you been doing real good  in this class real good till today  just give it a try  i went home yesterday my moms on the couch  she dead  memaw said best not come to school but  yeah you want to be with your mom  of course you did  some of you know me from narcotics work  some from earlier if you worked the western district  and some of you im meeting for the first time  but the only point id really like to make here today  is that this is a transitional time  for this department and for the city as a whole  we have a new mayor and a new states attorney  and they both feel like they have a mandate for change  the point is that given the mayors position on crime  and given the outcome of the election  we can expect certain enhancements  oh really  certain improvements  may be forthcoming in the near future  so were looking for feedback here  some input as to what we need  more of or less of to better work murders  better witness protection  more proactive investigation  pay raise  better lab work   more techs on duty  more overtime  more scotch  more time for case pp seriously  more women loose women  pay hike doubledigits  mo better mo better mo better  thats what we need  sounds like a new day dont it  departments finally gonna get what it needs  states attorneys office too  a new day  they make a nice couple anyway  looking forward to working with you  hats signed by a now inaugurated mayor  ordering his police commanders to avoid mass arrests  community based policing  and highend enforcements are to be emphasized  i take it burrell got a copy  in person  i dont see it  why not just fire the fucking asshole  the mayor is weighing his options  what the fuck does that mean  to fire burrell were going to need more  political capital than we have right now  speaking of which it brings us to another  little piece of business   the thing with the minister  its a delicate situation  the ministers are pressing for a civilian review  which i know the rankandfile dont want to hear  but it speaks directly to the situation with burrell  if we expend capital defending this incident  i get it you want the cop fired  no were not saying that at all  the mayor doesnt want to interfere with the everyday workings of the department  but its a balancing act  our response has to be smart and evenhanded  in a racial sense especially  if im hearing you its about perception  exactly  iid has a black commander but hes beholden to burrell  hell stir shit with this if he can  the sergeant in question is assigned to cid  his new commander is daniels  hes smart hes black and politically neutral  that work for you  works for us  who that i said whos that  you home or you just visiting  home if i can  all right get by the fire if you want  i got a couple of dogs left  you hungry  shit werent working out with jojo and them  said i owed him some cheddar or some shit some other boy did  i dont want to make no noise on that though  they pressin you  you know  get with me and we pay em right back ok  no all that shit you been sayin to me goin through my head  forget about that forget about all that  if i wouldnt have pushed you off  youd have never been on that corner  but everything i do i be fucking up  whole time it feel like it wasnt me on that corner  i just wanted to get away  well youre here now aint you right  this is you right here right now ok  youre burning a hole in that shirt man  fuck you fucked me all up when  i saw you walking through the door sherrod  shit  what you think huh  you know i get half price for this  all right take your hat off man  dont burn them pimp steaks huh  took long enough  yo dukie you sure about this  i mean im with yall  yall my boys like that  yall there for me im there for yall  im really starting to think this is some fuckedup shit  i mean officer walkers a shady motherfucker  but hes police  we do it michaels way we send a message  you aint got to do what i got to do  we drew straws nay  lets go  this is everything  sergeant hauks statement the ministers  statements of the other officers its all there  no independent witnesses huh  its a lot of smoke but im not feeling much in the way of fire  it was a strong case for discourtesy  true but no indication of racial or religious overtones  and the brutality allegation is a stretch  ive gone over goc7  im up to speed with the matrix  but since the buck stops with me on this one  walk me through my options  minor offenses you can issue a summary judgme  a period of extra duty without pay  guidance and counseling the like  or if sergeant hauk fights your decision  or if theres a more substantive charge  it goes downstairs to a trial board  and possible termination  let me ask you  if the ministers connected  and if all eyes are on this one  what does command want to see happen  what does city hall want to see happen  city hall just wants someone to do the right thing  whatever that is  youre sitting here deputy telling me to just do the right thing  doesnt happen often i know  hey what are you doing come here  you motherfucker when i get your little ass  come on show me hands bitch  back the fuck little hopper im police  yeah i know you the police who like to fuck with a nigger turn around  you aint gonna hear the next one  get on your knees cross them legs  knit them hand come on  ooh hold on  yo what the fuck you doing  what the fuck is wrong with you man  give up that ring man  come on  yeah  payback  thats right run motherfuckers  shit  im telling you right there  this horse is a winner look at it ok  how you doing  excuse me  mr mayor  on my way downtown today i saw an abandoned car  tow it right away  where is mr mayor the location  fucking christ call transpo  get the fucking trucks moving   mr mayor  i got a constituent call  she said the playground near her house  was a hazard rusted metal  well get right on it  the location sir i need a location  mr mayor i understand your concern but youve got to understand  we have more than 9100 hydrants  and one of thems leaking  sensitivity counseling  no punishment past that  they sliced it into the rough  does daniels know the bind this puts his boy carcetti in  well wilson briefed rawls rawls briefed daniels  its carcetti doing pontius pilate  putting it on daniels who was a safe choice  as far as the rankandfile goes  but that wont be enough for the ministers  not by a long shot  am i the only one that knows how to play this game  lets go get that hydrant sealed  coming outside the club  i made em for bloods  the paints supposed to be some kind of declaration of war  sounds like we get to stomp some ass  the western district way  yellow paint a declaration of war  thats a new one  so what i heard was that this wildass boys  i aint saying no names but they past crazy  they robbed him  they threw paint on his ass yellow paint  shit i aint lying  well i dont know about that  but you showed me something getting on that box like that  that wasnt nothing  no dont sell

ready  i aint going back there  why not  shit they teach there be deadly  but i know you know that bunny  all right all right all right all right  we can squeeze a little money from here and there  but nothing on the scale for what youre asking  maybe free up some operating money  by shifting some of these paygo projects  into the capital program  i can steal a little from the budget stabilization fund  but we still got to absorb 120 grant positions  in the police department mostly officers   christ dont let those go unfunded  a lot of balls in the air  and i still havent seen the schools budget  what about the revenue surplus  as i said thats onetime money  im going to give the police a 5 raise thats forever  if im gonna ask the police department to get up on its hind legs and fight  i got to throw some money youre telling me how i cant do not how i can  theres the rainy day fund but you really shouldnt draw that down  the bond rating houses want at least 5 of the budget in reserve  feels like a rainy day to me  cloudy like a motherfucker  yo yo wait up yo  hey yo check it   fuck is up with yall  aint you mike  we wanna have a word with your boy here  aint nothing

this day forward we are about quality arrests  felonies serious misdemeanors  the backtobasics police work of our sainted fathers  still the truth is it would be easier  to turn an oil tanker around

going to stand here and pretend i know how to do your job  i dont but what i can tell you is that  during the past few weeks i have spoken with many of your peers  with your union reps with the representatives of the fop  and the biggest single complaint im hearing  concerns the departments obsession with stats  the fucking numbers game  well under my watch the numbers game is over  you will no longer be under the gun to meet monthly quotas  of ineffective meaningless arrests and citations  excuse me your worship  youre not the first person who stood at the podium making promises  jimmy im sure the mayor has some pressing business  no im just saying the first community activist  who pitches a bitch about the corner activity in her neighborhood  arent we gonna go right back to rounding up bodies  we need to educate our citizens to the new approach  theyre not the only ones who need educating  we got bosses that wouldnt know police work if it bit em in the ass  they been juking stats for years  and will do it again once the neighborhoods complain  its all they know  if the old dogs cant get the job done ill find new ones who can  look for years i sat on the back bench of the council  and watched our city deteriorate  it was business as usual with the same old ideas  producing the same old results  well im here now as you are and im asking you  to put aside your reservations and give it a go  all told  you did good  you got em pumped they love you  of course the wrong decision on sergeant hauk and who knows  carv said the kid had something on it  i talked to him  he had nothing just a bunch of hearsay  and some shit about zombies  the boy was to come to me  you know the goddamn go its homicides call  you dont go putting your paws in my murder you simpel fuck  hey youre talking to a sergeant  oh fuck your fucking stripes  take it easy bunk  now herc is trying to help us here  man he messed in my murder he pays  give him a chance we can work something

everything you did on this case  from the beginning  hes out there hat in hand literally  well he can wait till hell freezes over  a wise man does not burn his bridges  until he first knows he can part the waters  old ashanti saying  norman you grew up in catonsville  show the motherfucker in  mr mayor  you know i dont want to take time out of your busy schedule  look if this is about me countermanding your orders   for more arrests  no sir  you should proceed as you feel the situation warrants  overall policing strategies may not be my strongest suit  im here about what i do know  a recommendation from sergeant hauks commander  will cross your desk tomorrow  colonel daniels with rawls concurring  recommends sensitivity training  it may be a fair decision  it may even be the right decision  but we both know it wont fly with the ministers  not even with daniels behind it  directives orders  you fire a white police for a bad car stop  on a black minister youll lose the rankandfile  its not cause enough but if a commander cant find  the grounds for firing a saint in here  the man has worked narcotics for 6 years  and in narcotics there are no virgins  and here in lies your expertise  ive always been comfortable delegating strategic elements  its what the deputy ops is for  me i know what a mayor needs  it was a chevy tahoe  license mike460654  and i searched

parents  not a one  this isnt a group where we see a lot of parental intervention  what about test scores  i cant speak to the program itself  but it has to help the rest of the 8th grade  next week

curriculum   meaning  if  city hall were to sign off on this we could go forward  but now is not the time to rock any boats  hear that thats my joint right there  so you all got your work up to date
