franklin terrace  money from a cashbar fundraiser the previous weekend  we filed an amended finance report that shows  fine  theres no probable cause for a search of mr price  i think we are in agreement on that  no there was pc for the search  youre saying you have evidence that a senatorial aide is involved in drugs  im saying we had reason to stop mr price  and effect a body search after which we discovered  20000 in cash in banded manicured bills  thats all im saying  will you explain to this motherfucker just what it is hes doing here  lt daniels excuse me sir  but its pretty basic  if the senator is not involved in anything illegal  then he doesnt need to worry  i cant be any clearer about it than that  fool what do you think  that we know anything about who gives money  that we
