shamrock  assuming stringer bell is the man now we wait for the return call  this is beautiful  lester can you actually believe we fucking sold  the wiretaps to the targets  for a week at least  maybe we duck the bullet  maybe we clean this mess quietly  throw some horseshit at whatever reporter shows up  and the mayor forges and forgets  were ready to move on this right  as soon as we get the word we shut down all three zones  toss everyone into wagons  therell be nothing left of it before midnight shift  so what the fuck are we waiting on for a day and half  why isnt the hall calling us  commissioner burrell for mayor royce   ive heard enough  hold on coleman  come on let the man talk huh  excuse me mayor i have commissioner burrell on the line   he says its urgent  ill bet it is  he wants to move clarence  he wants to clean this shit up yesterday and so do we  tell him to hold   go ahead gene  look  im not a politician im an academic  all i know is that from a public health perspective  there are remarkable things happening in the free zones  needle exchanges onsite blood testing condom distribution  most of all were interacting with an atrisk community  that is largely elusive  were even talking some of these people into drug treatment  and thats just what um and bon secours have brought to the table  if this thing were sanctioned  my department could put public resources into play  you people cant see the forest here  odell  when the story breaks the ministers will surely be against you  and most of the city council will be walking sideways  away from your administration  and my guess is the governor and the legislature  will use this opportunity to piss on the city from a great height  and washington oh  can you imagine how far  the united states department of justice  is gonna crawl up your ass behind this  crime is down odell  medical people are telling me this could work  i mean a 14 decline in felonies citywide  i might be untouchable on this now look we need to think  see if we can keep this thing going without  calling it what it really is huh   jesus  now theres got to be a way  i want you to talk this thing out hey erv thanks for holding  yes but  yes i understand  then ill wait to hear from you  were to hold off on any action in amsterdam  no arrests no movement until further notice  he says he wants to regroup  determine the most effective course of action  translate that for me will ya erv i dont speak his fuckedup lingo  royce is figuring a way to put all of us in the guillotine  and keep the blood from spraying anywhere near the hall  shit ill be goddamned if im gonna go out like that  bent over in public  i can spin the story just as well as that motherfucker   youre gonna go to the press  not me  but i know a slick little bastard  who will happily put hizzoners shit in the street  somethin funny bout that  cause i look in the paper and i see all these federal grants comin down  but nothin for bandb   youre expecting what  payout  a big payout for what we put in man  federal dollars on them howard street rehabs   you gave money up front  250000 yep  to clay davis  how you know  what you sayin  hes runnin game naw hell no he aint that brazen  lemme guess  he told you about the faucet  or was it the goose that laid the golden egg  you ever actually meet the man  did you ever actually see any of your cash reach anyone in authority  yeah i met the guy at the federal building  yeah i met him  yeah what office  he came down to the lobby  he rainmade you  a guy says if you pay him he can make it rain  you pay him if and when it rains he takes the credit  if and when it doesnt he finds reasons for you to pay him more  clay davis rainmade you  naw man he got them building permits in no time at all man  i mean we bribing these motherfuckers  he got the city contractors money back   how much  35000 so far   on a quarter million you gave him  its for bribing the motherfuckers  there are no bribes  you really think a state senator is going  to risk his salary and his position  by walking into a federal office with a briefcase full of drug money  i seen chunky chunky coates  chunky coates gets his grant money same way everyone does  he fills out applications he makes sure the plans meet spec  then he prays like hell  this is an old game in this town and clay davis  that goniff was born with his hand in someones pocket  i just wish youd have run it by me sooner  now heres shamrock returning bodies call  talk about it   yo the man said hed see you same time as always   you know the spot   during the first call sydnor had eyes on shamrock over in west baltimore  alright now look at this  at the time stringer bell was at the print shop  so it couldnt be a facetoface meet  we didnt catch a call between stringer and shamrock  how can that be  stringers phone isnt on the same network as everyone below him   right you are maam  bells not using bernards burners  and shamrock has a separate phone for calling bell  we cant hear those calls because the systems compartmentalized  some tricky motherfuckers  a week or so up on bernards phones and well have everybody  up to and including shamrock tangled up in conspiracy counts  but bell or barksdale  not unless we can pluck their cell numbers out the air  where you headed toy store  he legalized drugs in special zones  its more than that  major colvin lost the necessary perspective  that is required for command  we were all under pressure to reduce crime before year end  and he responded poorly to that pressure  pressured by who mayor  im just explaining to you  that the pressure was applied all down the line  from headquarters to the district commanders  to the shift and sector supervisors  so colvins 14 decline was bullshit  and theyre selling drugs with police permission in western  the department is ready to shut that mess down with mass arrests   im on top of it  why dont you move  the mayor says wait  why  i think hes gonna make some kinda show  spin it so that i take the weight  for something that has nothing to do with me  and everything to do with the pressure  that my commanders are getting from city hall  going public and putting the responsibility for this  back at city hall is the only move i have left right  i mean i spin royce before he spins me   and you want me to  not you  your pal tony gray  if hes gonna take a run at royce hes gonna need ammunition right  i dont have a relationship with gray i do have one with you  and councilman you owe me   whats up hotshot  i got a technical question  remember those analog units we used  to use to pull cell numbers out of the air  the cf somethingsomething  yeah cell frequency identification device   the triggerfish yeah  that one it could flag a number  right but the old analog machines  we used to have to follow the guy around  stay close while he used the phone new digitals  bing we just pull the number right off the cell towers  so you got any down out at woodlawn that daddy can borrow   what about yours  what  city has three of em i remember right  homeland security grant sent em to you  every big county department in the state  no fucking way  thanks   i doubted you tommy  i told you it was big  if we play it right  he wants me to turn the information over to tony gray  and let him use it he figures if tonys running against the mayor  hell take aim at royce and not the department  we may want to bring tony in on it  keep him viable against the mayor  but right now you need to find out what this is all about  firsthand do you know this major colvin  to shake hands maybe  if burrells painting him the villain  colvin might be anxious to tell someone his side of the story  mcnulty major crimes  sullivan minor irritations  you got anything back there thats like the old cfid but digital   for catching cell numbers  catching who  you know a triggerfish machine  triggerfish for cell numbers  how bout i look around there on my own  yes this is councilman carcetti over at the hall  im trying to reach major colvin  im sorry but hes on vacation   im aware of that but im trying to reach him on municipal business  well i could put you through to his voice mail   no not his voice mail i said i have to reach him immediately   immediately  right   how about his cell phone  his cell itll be fine  alright fouroh   alright thats enough  yeah i know it hurts  but your fists gonna be like rocks after awhile  justin cmere   alright  i want you to push me on my chest  you aint got to do it hard  thats how you was standin  you aint have no weight on your back foot  thats right  no center of gravity plus if you get your stance right  then you got the means to put your hip into the punch  bubbub

celltower  the one that would be the conduit for calls  coming to and from our boy bell  and  we let rip  fucking hell  looks like baltimore white pages without any names  but the pattern trace will pull that down  you know if we know the approximate time of bells call  we can start just by pulling calls off that tower at that time  that could be thousands  yeah thats the baseline but we get a second hit   and that list comes down to dozens  and after a third or fourth  then weve got his number  i cant believe that this was just sitting over at isd gathering dust  were going to be on these
