you can help me out with  ill try  what are the options when you got an inferior product  in an aggressive marketplace  if you have a large share of the market you can buy up the competition  and if you dont  reduce price to increase market share  that assumes low overhead  of course otherwise you operate at a loss  and worse as your prices drop  your product eventually loses consumer credibility  you know the new ceo of worldcom was faced with this very problem  the company was linked to one of the largest fraud cases in history   so he proposed  to change the name  exactly  which one  hes got a weenie in his hand  on this case aint that you  thomas pakusa come on down  what the fuck is that  grand jury summons  grand jury  you lie to us you hurt our feelings  you lie to them its

stab his eye with it  ashamed he should be to be greek and call this a diner  a talk would ease his mind  ease my mind first  this business with the grand jury  we checked the courthouse there is nothing special  just the regular panels  theyre trying to scare the men on the docks   and  nobody talks  but sobotka as i said hes upset  it is more attention than he expected  he will need money for his lawyers  double his fee but i dont need to meet with him  let the money talk  everything we get from atlanta been walked on  each one weaker than the other  and this nigger roberto is on the shelf to us right now  i mean its getting hard to hold onto the towers  without our name all over the product is what im saying  who got the good shit  eastside  eastside who  this nigger milton got a small cut prop joe  this jamaican cat who got the strip off gay street  you talking about petey petey dixon  you go over to the expressway at lunchtime  you can watch the fiends traveling from west to east  damn  i mean im cutting shit with shit right now trying to cheat but sooner or later  i hear you man im on it  you working it out with dee  boy got to find his own way  im saying you know  i think we should keep reaching out to this kid  give something to him and his girl i dont know show them we got a plan  take some real estate put it in dees name  he has something to come home to  do it  thing is string what happened happened you know what i mean  push come to shove ive been fair to him aint i  youve been fair  too fair   wheres the greek  he sent me  fuck you and fuck him  frank he sent me to tell you that were doubling your fee  to help with any legal troubles  he also told me to tell you he regrets  that youre still having problems on our behalf  theyre throwing my people in back of police cars  and this asshole cant even talk face to face  im done im out  i need nothing more to do with you people  i dont need the trouble or the money i got a union to run  they used to make steel there no  smoke from the stacks  but inside  potassium permanganate  spell permanganate  fuck  you even know what the fuck youre doing there zig  im in the checkers local right  you know while you local 47 boys  were having bulk cargo dropped on your heads  we was out grabbing the future by the balls  so you just type that shit in there and ask it for an answer  let me ask you  why do we give a fuck what the shit is for  if they want it they want it  i mean besides if i dont get some money soon  im fucking toasted  i dont know who youve been talking to  but we dont have that kind of stealing going on down here   its not like the old days  no  a little here and there but for the most part  the new technology has changed everything  look see this little box right here  you fucking mind  rings a little stressed right now  having misplaced a frozen can full of japanese tuna steaks  supposed to be at the jessup wholesale market by yesterday  bite me   frank these officers are  i know who they are  frank here helped set this system up  he probably can explain it better than i can if he doesnt mind  no problem chief  in a nutshell what this shows  is the aqua verde at berth 4  the plan calls for 85 moves  thats cans containers coming off the ship and others going back on  now look at the screen  every time a can goes on or off the computer creates a record  and puts it in the permanent database  he was saying the computer makes it hard to steal off the docks  did our port manager tell you that right now  we got 160 boxes missing off the patapsco terminal alone  or that last time we inventoried the truck chassis  we came up 300 light  no i suppose not thats management for you   not that all of them are stolen  you can lose a can by accident no problem  for one thing these handhelds use radio waves  with all the equipment and container stacks out there  sometimes waves get knocked down  that happens a can dont get entered  or just as easy a checker makes the wrong entry  either cause hes lazy hes sloppy or hes still shitfaced from the night before  or simpler than that you got fat fingers no offense  so imagine february on the docks  youre wearing gortex gloves trying to punch numbers on that thing  youre saying thats what happened to the can  with the girls in it  beadie darling i dont know what happened there  im just saying if you go by the computer  it might look like theres some dirt going down  when its really just a glitch in the system  the customs seal was broke on that box shouldnt that get noticed  youre offloading a ship the size of a small town  you might notice a broke seal you might not  look you wanna keep pulling our chain you can  but it aint like its just that one box that went missing  we lose them sons of bitches all the time   frank give you everything you need  he did thanks  theyre playing us  you drove all the way from baltimore on a hope and a prayer  yeah im deadended on this  is there anything we can offer any of them for cooperation  you could marry one of them make her an american housewife  short of that theyre going back the fuck where they came from   where do you hold them  county detention  we keep the undocumenteds out of gen pop  you all heard of worldcom  all right lets try this  you all get jacked by some knockos  but you all clean  you all got an outstanding warrant like everybody in here  what do you do  give another name  why  because your real name aint no good  all right it aint good and follow through  all right death grip aint shit  then change up the name  what else  yo i got it change the caps from red to blue right  make it look like we got some fresh shit boom  you know what else we might could do give each tower its own name right  and then we do like some fake competing  so a fiend gets some bad shit from one hed go back to the other  theres a thinking man right there  see nigger aint that what the fuck i just said  you and my uncle talk  howd it go  no problem  three boxes  all of them on the wilhelmina and you should tell your uncle  that its three times the usual fee for each  we checked on those chemicals  we looked into that  i was worried you know  before i deliver i wanna know what you need it for  a bomb or some shit  i aint down for that  you use that shit to process drugs dont you  cocaine  you still want it i got it on the fairfield piers  no problem  when  end of the week  maryska  shes good with english  theyre dead  all im trying to do is get word to the families  what did she say  she wants to know if she knows a girl does she get to stay  you want a good restaurant for dinner or are you headed right back  a computer  to run a trace on the missing containers in the port administrations database  youre looking for what  a pattern for our case we need to know who left those girls on the dock and why  were supposed to be on sobotka and the checkers union anyway  so folding one investigation into the other makes sense  not to me it doesnt  im not bringing your open murders  anywhere near this detail thats a loser for us  lieutenant  we bring in a few drug rips and show that we gave sobotka  and his union a quick fair look its more than enough for burrell  he returns the favor and im out of the basement  and running an investigative unit again  you dirty me up with murders i cant solve it doesnt play like that  homicides not the place to sprawl a case lieutenant  rawls landsman  they have no patience for anything but a quick shake  we got enough room for it here anyway  you can set up here at the offsite  and we can share information  but the murders stay with homicide  unless of course you find a suspect  three roiros four containers  i got all my cards up including long numbers  and were still short   a good day  that it is  everybody works today even you my little jseries wonders  even you  is horse working the wilhelmina today  i told that motherfucker we were done i told him  he said he talked to you he said its triplerate for every can  triple  call horse in the tower tell him hes working the wilhelmina  its now or never for us i got no choice  today we got ships uncle frank today  but the writings on the fucking wall  fuck the wall
