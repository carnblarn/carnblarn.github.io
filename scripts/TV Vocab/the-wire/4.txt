the county right on the high end of the eastside  they got these apartments out there right  so there was this little shorty who used to stay out there  she was like  i aint seen a female that fine since  i gotta say shorty was right  you fucked her  no man it wasnt like that  this was a shorty my uncle was messing with  they was going on at it for a little while  till she find out that my uncle got another little shorty round the way  more right to say he got a few of them around the way  know what im saying  so she goes off the hook talking about calling the police  about shit she aint supposed to know  oh shit yeah you know it  but see i got some creep to me and my uncle he know that shit  so they roll me out past her crib  and they show me how she lives right on the ground floor first level  i go creeping around the back to the back window  i got the 45 on me the big gun  i walk up to the window and i look in and its dark as shit  because its 300 am and you cant see shit  what did you do  so i pulled out the piece  and i start tapping with the back of it on the window  and it was quiet but it was loud enough so she can hear that shit  thats what she heard yo sure enough she comes out  shes naked and shit  i dont know why the fuck but she has a robe  and as she slipping on her robe she turns on the light  and when she does that and its light on the inside  she cant see shit on the outside  damn she naked  she hears that shit on the window and she aint got no choice  but to walk over there and see what it is  she steps up  iooks out  see where its coming from  what happened  he shot her  yo dee if she was all that why didnt you fuck her first  nigger you sick just shut up what im just saying  there is something seriously wrong  this is ridiculous  because a lab freezer goes out with an electrical short  blood samples in 56 homicides   states attorney knows the mayor too  most of our trace lab is now 25 years old  you ever go outside for money the nonprofits  such as  the abell foundation for one my brothers on the board  if you want me to run it up there for you  you could swing that never hurts to ask does it  it never does your honor  so in that same spirit  where are we with the barksdale probe  my other reason for stopping by  handtohands and searchandseizures ive heard about these  some midlevel players caught up as you can see  look its not a knockout blow but we sent a clear message  i dont see barksdales name anywhere  or bell or anything about the murders  the casework it goes towards that  no  so weve got work to do dont we  police open the damn door  what open the motherfucking door  upstairs front clear kitchens clear  im at the backdoor  anybody pop out here okay quiet  upstairs rear clear  im gonna beat this bitch like a redheaded stepchild  for hiding up in this pisshole  goddamn creepy crawlers everywhere  tell bodie were on his ass  im sorry for cursing at the door  i mean i couldnt see that it was only you  is it the drugs again  would you like to sit down  preston came to me when my daughter died  he was four years old  but even then i knew he was angry  his mother lived out there caught up in it  after a while you couldnt make her see nothin else  no man that wasnt us  you guys are crazy man  i dont know what youre talkin about  so how you think you gonna carry it  im sorry maam  and im sorry for the way we came through here  if preston comes past  give him this  and tell him we need to talk okay  im sorry  what the fuck you doing in there  talking  talking yeah  see you later all right catch you later  im driving  yeah  mcnulty  some judge for you  yeah  look can i call you back  major sir yeah  ive been thinkin  its a clear violation of the general orders i know but  last night im at home im sittin up buck naked  and i got one hand wrapped around a cold domestic beer  and the other wrapped around my magnificent flaccid  fourandonehalf inch wonder and i am trying with all my might  to remember what leila kaufmans nipples looked like  when her bathing top slipped off at the hillendale pool swim party  leila kaufman yes sir  summer of 72  i got this saucy wench in my gunsights so to speak  and i am dangerously  close to engorged  when all of a fuckin sudden out of fuckin nowhere  fuckin detective fuckin jimmy mcnulty pops into my head  mcnulty  obviously i gotta open my eyes and admit to myself  that my whole night is ruined  at which point i got nothing to do  but think about the problems of jimmy mcnulty  because clearly this guy  and his fuckin problems are standing between me and all worldly pleasure  clearly  first of all its not jimmys fault  no no  jimmy is an addict sir  whats he addicted to  himself  its not funny sir  as a matter of fact its a fuckin tragedy is what it is  the guy he has come to believe  that he is always the smartest fuck in the room  and you know what its not his fault because lets face it  hes not going to johns hopkins or joining mensa  hes taking a fuckin job with the baltimore police department  his first two years in homicide hes in ulmanskys squad  partnered with tony lamartino  christ it mustve been months even  he was the smartest fuck in the fuckin room  whats your point jay  my point is  he cant help it  it makes him an asshole i know  but its also what makes him good police  last year he gives me eight clearances  one of them was a decomp floater  who was john doe for three weeks  tell your boy to wrap up that bullshit detail in two weeks  he does that he comes home clean slate  you wouldve loved it  burrell is sittin across from me with a handful ofstreetlevel arrests  pretendin he has a plan  so what did you tell him  never shit a shitter deputy  thats what i fuckin told him  i did good right jimmy i gotta go  discuss the hicks ruling as a manifestation  of the judiciarys attempt to maintain a speedy disposition  of criminal cases within a modern court system  what  thats what i said  what  what the hells the hicks ruling  did you highlight my sofa  what no  yes you did  that was there from before  hell it was damn kima marker does not come out  no i didnt do it i swear okay let me see the marker  you want my marker i need to see a warrant  im serious i need to see some probable cause  im gonna beat your ass how about that for probable cause  give me the marker damn gettin all violent and shit  you know you just violated my civil rights  thats it new rule no marker on the couch  you get over to that table over there and do your homework  go take it and go  gimme my marker  im gonna need some club soda  damn girl this cell phone bill must eat up the paycheck  no most of thats work its on the company  phelan wont let go  are we anywhere close on barksdale  no sir so what are you telling me  im not telling you anything sir im waiting for you to tell me  i can do whatever you need me to do with this  if you want me to push it further i can do that  if you want it to go away  if you wanna bring in someone else maybe do things differently  you looking for the back door lieutenant  already  mcnulty says this case needs a wire  you think hes right  it needs somethin  just climb your ass up the pole man  no man thisll work  im not climbin no damn ladder  you never gonna hit it man  bomb  housing must think we just dumb is that  thats your pager or mine thats me  yo watch that shit on my head man it ricocheted off the fuckin camera  yeah you need some aim  yo who this  so what do you think  title 3  right but its not for a wiretap its to clone a pager i got it from pearlman  pagers some kind of throwback thing  you mean why not cell phones right who uses pagers anymore  tell you what i was checking out a wireless bill last night  every incoming call was listed  right so if we get barksdales pager we might get off the street  maybe even trace some supply  so whos noheart anthony  noheart ran drugs in the homes in the early 90s  so a couple years back i dont know why  he finds himself in randallstown tryin to take off a jewelry store  he fucks it up half the county chases him back downtown  and i guess noheart figures hes not up for doing the time  cause he puts a 44 against his chest pulls the trigger  a 44  its a contact wound  wakes up two hours later in the university er  with a new nickname right  bubbles says its anthonys brother  who took off with the barksdale stash the other night  dude named omar  its not the easiest trade you know robbin dealers  man like that is likely to have a weapon on him  we jack him up theres a charge to work off  and if he knows where the barksdale stash is  he probably knows a whole lot more  see another plan  the thing is were gonna have to sell this  you wanna raise it with daniels  hell listen to you more than me  wheres santangelo  hes at ecu hes got a case going today  as of today i havent heard anything to the contrary so  were gonna press on  ideas  we could continue with the busts  but i dont think thats gonna get us too far off the street  on the other hand the people we pulled in last week had pagers  so did dangelo barksdale when mcnulty jacked him up  we could clone a couple of pagers see where that takes us  clone what their pagers  they get beeped we get beeped we see whos calling from what number  if theyre all that why are they still using pagers  why not unass a few dollars for cell phones  its a discipline  you cant bug a pager  but you cant make a call with a pager either  youre gonna want a pen register on all the payphones in the lowrises  and any other phones that link to the pagers  what would it take to do the pagers  a wiretap affidavit  i think we got enough pc from the handtohands and surveillance  we got most of the exhaustion  im exhausted just listening to this shit  good exhaustion is a legal requirement for using electronic intercepts  we gotta prove nothing else works  see we did the raids we made the arrests but nobody flipped  we dont have an informant who takes us anywhere above the street  thats pretty much exhaustion  all we got left to do now is follow one of these mopes  and prove to ourselves we cant do it  we try to show a judge we cant make  the case by following these guys and we cant  how can we keep on any of them when theyre in those towers  but you gotta show you tried  do we have a pager number  this was written on the stash house wall  with the letter d next to it  is that dangelo did you check it  its him  lets do this  what does he want us to do i dont understand  ill explain it to you if you buy me breakfast  will you explain to me again  why im about to rework a sixmonthold crime scene  look at this narrowass file keeley didnt do shit on this  he did the scene though  this is keeley were talking about  fucking jay and his leaps of logic  this case is nowhere near anything were doing  so give it a shake or two anyhow  make a sergeant happy whatever  do you know lester freamon  a little why  hes with us on this barksdale thing  i thought you said they gave you humps  he looks like a hump he acts like a hump sittin there playing with his toy furniture  jimmy he makes more money off of that shit than you do off of this job  dont let lester fool you he did already  today in roll call he showed something  hey hes natural police  he used to be homicide  why did he leave ask him  this is the one yup hasnt been rented since  fuck  motherfucker  fucking fuck  fuck  fuck  what the fuck  fuck  fuck  no fuck  fuck it  fuck  motherfuck  fuck  fuckity fuck fuck  fuck  fuck  motherfucker  fuckin a  fuck  check this  motherfucker  fuck me  sydnors on foot carvs in the car  herc you need to be on top of the roof behind amity  again i get the shit detail  the plan is to stay on dangelo  if we lose him we lose him right  were gonna lose him  you cant follow people in the towers  you cant hang in the lowrises unless you got a reason  just to make sure we want to lose him right  losin him is good  right  then why the fuck do this  come on herc roll with me on this one all right  so youre police after all  you know what you doing but you aint been doing it  how long you been in the pawnshop unit   13 years and four months  i gotta ask you  what exactly does a police officer assigned to the pawnshop unit do  you intake reports from registered pawnshops  on all items valued over 50  then you make an index card for that item  then you file that index card  if someone wants to find out if something stolen was pawned  we see if we have an index card  if we do we do if we dont we dont  you did that for 13 years and four months  whyd you ask out of homicide  wasnt no ask about it  you got the boot  whatd you do to piss them off  police work  i think i need to buy you a drink  just one  caught this case in a brooklyn home in the summer of 87   nightgown in bed forced window rear entry  worked it for a couple of weeks  got the names of two squirrels over in curtis bay  squirrel number one gives it up  and tries to put all the weight on squirrel number two  back up the statements  print it on the rear window for number two  another one for number one on the medicine chest  so its down yeah  even better when squirrel number one drives it by the house  where they fenced the old ladys shit  clockradio tv toaster oven  so whats the problem  the problem is the fence  turned out he was the son of one of the big editors  over at the news america  this man is running the afternoon newspaper  and his son is getting all fucked up  doin the dirt and getting high down in locust point  the deputy who i guess is in a favordoin mood  sends word down to the major  im supposed to make the case without the fence  just the print hits and the statement play it like that  so hes doin this for what  to have some newspaper guy in his pocket  yeah i guess so  is this burrell  no no mueller deputy ops before burrell  so what did you do  what do you think i did  i charged him with receiving then had his ass testify  you couldve made the case without him just on the prints and the statements  probably yup  why didnt you  why  why are you fuckin up yourself chasing avon barksdale  a week after trial ends major comes to me  asks me where i want to go  i tell him i dont care i like to be outside you know  give me a goddamn footpost  ill still make my money you know  send my ass up to edmondson avenue i dont give a shit  you went to a footpost  major come back asks me where i dont want to go  and he asks it like he wanna make sure i land okay  so i tell him i dont want no fuckin papershuffle  no office shit  send my black ass outside and let me police somewhere  pawnshop unit  they got me good  so whyd they let you out of the box why now  i guess they just forgot about me  shit lester  you back from the dead  you rolled away the stone  bunk moreland says youre natural police one of the few  yeah ive had my moments  detective  when they ask you where you
