                mike molly you coming to bed  in a minute  you said that ten minutes ago  i know im sorry let me just finish this chapter  how long you gonna be  joyce just go down and do her on the couch  mom  so what do you think  no im not doing it on the couch  apparently were not doing it anywhere anymore  look if im gonna get this viceprincipal job  and make a difference at the school  im gonna have to put in some extra time  i get wanting to fight the system  in junior high i spearheaded a petition  to revoke the fourmilk limit  how did that work out for you  they buried me in a sea of red tape  sweetie im sorry i havent given you  a lot of attention lately but this is important to me  i understand ill let you get back to your work  and ill see you in the morning  hang on  yes  ill go upstairs with you for a while  but then i gotta come back down and finish my work  so youre gonna have sex with me just to shut me up  no not just to shut you up  just to put you to sleep and so you wont talk anymore  hang on a second have you done this before  not intentionally chuckles  no im not that desperate you go ahead and study  if your hearts not in it 100  im not gonna enjoy it either  okay  good night  good night  you know i dont really need 100  whats passing  like 70 right can you at least give me 70    im telling you if we pick the right costumes  this halloween we can both get lucky with the ladies  im listening  the key is we both cant be dressed sexy  cause that puts off a gay vibe  and the chicks will think were a couple  we should avoid that if possible  indeed we should  so one of us needs to dress sexy  while the other one dresses cute  that way the cute guy earns their trust  while the sexy guy closes the deal  here we go  for example i could dress up as the dashing spaniard zorro  and you could be my little sidekick spongebob squarepants  why cant i be zorro  do you have a zorro costume  no  well i do  i also have a spongebob costume that  this one would never wear  samuel dont do this  he just wants you to look like an idiot  so he can increase his odds  thank you mike i was unable to see through  carls clever machinations  youre still pissed about that  me tarzan you humpty dumpty debacle  yeah me still pissed  it was the most humiliating night of my life  hey thats not on me  youre the one who spent all night bellyaching  and pouring tequila shots into your egghole  i sat on a barstool for three hours  while people kept trying to push me over  you know how hard it is to defend yourself  when youre dressed as an egg  no but i know how funny it is  ah  some drunk guy wearing a chicken suit kept trying  to sit on his face  halloween is a stupid holiday  even as a kid no matter how cool my costume was  i was always the fat cowboy or fat superman  i dressed as dracula once  and everybody thought i was pavarotti  i do agree its a very odd ritual  children walking doortodoor  holding out empty sacks begging for food  in my country thats not called halloween its called tuesday  first of all the common misconception is  that its a holiday for children  in fact it is an excuse for grown women to dress slutty  get crazy drunk and make bad decisions  like going home with zorro and spongebob  make sure you got enough money for cab fare  when zorro here ditches you for two girls  dressed like a good witch and a bad witch  that was a weird night  it turns out the good witch was actually the bad witch  and the bad witch was actually a dude  meanwhile i was at the ihop dressed as an egg  having pancakes with a chicken  so mollys working late again tonight huh  yeah shes really shooting for that viceprincipal job  viceprincipal huh  kind of a butch job for a broad isnt it  what are you talking about  well in my day the viceprincipal was  a hairy goon that slapped you around  for taking a girls cherry in the gym teachers skylark  you understand she works at an elementary school right  absolutely if it was junior high  theyd kneecap you with a phone book  well i think most schools now have  really cut back on the physical abuse  and thats the reason  were all gonna be speaking chinese in ten years  i think nowadays the viceprincipal jobs  mostly administrative and not so much about skullcracking  well goodbye america  i hope you dont mind rickshaws in the carpool lane  im actually very proud of molly  instead of just griping about the problem  shes trying to fix it  oh one of those huh  well youre a better man than me my friend  i wouldnt be able to take a back seat  to my old ladys career  its not about taking a back seat  im just trying to be supportive of my partner  and i admire that  i guess im not man enough to be as womanly as you are  you know vince id ask you to come join me  in this century but you dont seem  all that comfortable in the last one  call me oldfashioned  but unlike a suit a relationship does not come  with two pairs of pants  hey i just remembered i have a tv in my room  aw come on i hurt your feelings  you know sometimes youre kind of a big girl  yeah well this big girl has a gun in her room  son of a bitch always has to play that card  mike sweetheart
