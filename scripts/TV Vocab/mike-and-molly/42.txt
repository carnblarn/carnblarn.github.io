                1 peggy all right  this should be more than enough kibble  to last until i get back from branson  one bowl in the morning and another one at night  thats easy to remember my sisters on the same schedule  its that kind of flipping attitude  that will put jim on a missing dog poster  or spread eagle in a car grill  she cannot be trusted with your little brother  dont worry about anything  just relax and enjoy your trip  well the altar rosary society  has been planning this senior excursion for ages  in fact the lady who spearheaded the whole thing  went toes up last month  oh thats tragic  were still taking her with us  she wanted her ashes scattered in the sawdust  on the dance floor at gilleys  thats nice  well she loved to boot scoot and boogie  plus she was an alcoholic who never met a cowboy  she couldnt buck before the bell   sounds like a sweetie  i didnt care for her  anyway  make sure jim has got his chew toy  highpitched squeak  otherwise hell be whiskerdeep in his poopshoot  mikes exactly the same way  ive got to put tabasco in his underpants  giggling  you know what if yuckapuck cant keep a cork in it  im just gonna stay here  no mom  its

hearts  some responsibility for when you decide  to have your own little 14pound miracle  well im sure if we ever have kids  well look back on babysitting your dog   as a valuable learning experience

neutered  im just saying with the wedding and everything  dont we have enough crap to worry about  without bringing kids into the mix  im not asking you to plant your seed on the ride home  but iid like to know that youre open  to having a family yeah i guess  i dont know if it happens it happens  do you have any idea how this works  did you sleep through health class  look we dont even have our own place  you really want to raise a child  in a house with your mom and sister  his first birthday party will be at the betty ford clinic  when i said  i wanted three kids and you said sounds good

you  when did you become so baby crazy  am i gonna have to sleep with one eye open  so you dont steal my sperm  youre gonna have to sleep with one eye open  so i dont smother you with a pillow  oh ha ha real mature  ha ha real mature  mike you forgot the dog again  molly no you forgot the dog  mike great mom youd be  for the first time in my life   i see love    morning  morning  i heard screaming coming out of your bedroom last night  and it didnt sound like the good kind  do you want to talk about some of the disturbing things  ive heard coming out of your bedroom  hot buns coming at ya  really mom  youre the one who gave me the chefs hat and apron  to be used in the kitchen  i would but i dont want you kids walking in on us  morning mrs flynn  hello yeah whatever  howd you sleep mike  backtoback  not gonna have a baby that way  unless hes some kind of circus freak  have a pleasant morning  good day to you yeah whatever  okay want to talk about it  no  hes been leading me on this whole time  making me think he wants a family  and now hes backpedaling  remember when i took you kids to the circus  and we saw that big bear on a unicycle  hmm  wwhat does that have to do with anything  beats me it just popped in my head  im not getting any younger  and if we want to have kids two girls and a boy  charlotte zelda and scott  hes gonna have to get on the stick  technically youre the one who has to be on the stick  i thought we had this talk  yes we did when i was 12  i just got over it about a year ago  im just saying  you cant plan these things  i mean take me for example  i never wanted children  what  hell no  only reason youre even here  is because of too many tequila shots  and an expired gas station condom  oh god  dont want to know dont need to know  oh geez  i was a wreck when i found out  i mean you know im happy now  you were a blessing blah blah blah  but oh boy  those were dark days  mom ffeel free  to take some of this to your grave  the real fluke was your sister  your daddy and i were watching the cubs on tv  and there was a rain delay  the ground crew had time to roll out their tarp  but your daddy and i didnt  i walked this ugly bastard nine blocks  and he wouldnt squeeze one out  nary a turd  i on the other hand had to duckwalk  to the 7eleven and take a crap  with a dog on my lap  im gonna  just go to work  oh have a good day  you know in the last couple of years  you girls have really started to grow on me  id pet you but  im actually more of a cat person  im not saying i dont ever want to be a dad  but im not just gonna blindly jump into it  im the kind of guy that likes to think things through  since when i once saw you bite into a marshmallow  that was still on fire  it was falling off the stick  i had to do something  the point is i really like what molly and i have  and if we throw a kid into the mix itll change everything  well thats true no more naked leap frog in the living room  when little mikeys in there watching road runner  and gnawing on a big wheel of cheese  well our foreplay  usually just involves me rubbing her feet  and turning off the tv but i know what youre saying  on the other hand  you and molly are good people  and would certainly make fine parents  but that doesnt guarantee what kind of kid youre gonna get  take that idiot we arrested this morning  im sure his parents are lovely people  who never imagined that one day the little bundle of joy  would try to rob a liquor store using an ear of corn  his mistake was taking it out of his pocket  and trying to fire a warning shot  no his mistake was waking up this morning saying  im gonna knock off a liquor store with an ear of corn  a banana i could understand  thats got a natural pistol grip  but corn  thats just lazy  point being  somewhere there are two nice people  who had high hopes for that moron  its true my parents had 14 children  and a couple have been major disappointments  ah dont be so hard on yourself samuel  i mean being a waiter  may not be glamorous or even lucrative  but its a good honest living  i was actually referring to my brothers  the pimp and the blood diamond smuggler  but thank you for the ego boost  absolutely  groans  hey could i get a glass of orange juice  of course i shall fetch a special glass of oj  just for you  fresh squeezed  i wouldnt drink that if i were you  why not  see  and your parents probably had high hopes for you too  hes been doing it all day  first it was funny then it got sad  now its back to being funny again  you never see a cat carrying on like this  theyre dignified animals  clean their butts with their tongues  he still grinding his balloon knot  yeah hes really rubbing it raw  im a little worried hes gonna start a fire  probably a roid  my uncle benny used to get the same way  but instead of a rug hed use a long shoe horn  i hope hes okay  hes fine hes in miami beach  got a nurse that rubs ointment on it  she meant the dog vince  him hes having the time of his life  hes scratching his ass on a nice rug  with a coupla pretty ladies watching him  aw pretty youre sweet  hey whats going on  your house guest is christening  my new throw rug with his sphincter  ah did he eat something weird  he wont eat at all plus he hasnt pooped all day  that is miserable  when i was taking pain pills for my back  i couldnt buy a good bowel movement  and believe me after nine days money is no object  jim retching  jim just threw up a little  well somebody was bound to  retching continues  jim just threw up a lot  and hes not eating it mmmm  this is serious okay we gotta go to the vet  horn honking  come on come on lets move it people  molly calm down im sure jim will be fine  hey if anything happens to that dog you tell that vet to put me down  otherwise peggy will come after me and do it her way  and it will be slow and it will be painful  horn honking  got yourself a sick lizard there huh  hes an iguana  and yes hes not feeling a hundred percent right now  looks fine to me i mean fine for a big scary lizard  iguana iguana  jacobs been very stressed out since my husband and i split up  hes listless lethargic he doesnt want to do anything  well i can see why you split up with him chuckles  im talking about the iguana i know i know  i just i joke when i get upset  my future motherin laws dog is sick  and it happened on my watch  and shes not exactly my biggest fan  not that im hanging her poster in my locker if you know what i mean  so what do you what do you feed this uh thing here  bugs or some kind of lizard chow  iguana  boy you dont open the door a crack do you  cell phone rings  sighs  peggy hey hows branson  oh everybody cant be stupid  jim jims fine  uh he cant talk right now  hes uh doing business  uh solid i guess  tapering nicely  well uh neighbors are watching out the window  so id better pretend to pick it up  okay bye  sorry it took so long  i was burning a doob back by the dumpst  oh my god that dog is really sick  iguana and heads up hes got the personality  so is jim gonna be okay  or do we need to find another dog that looks just like him  theyre still doing more tests  but keep an eye peeled  we may have to shave and paint a cat  been there done that  who belongs to jim  oh right here is he okay  well hes got some sort of obstruction  looks like he swallowed something  is there any idea of how long its been in there  could this have happened a couple of days ago  possibly yes  could have happened on peggys watch  what did he swallow  ive seen this kind of blockage before  and with a small dog its usually a sponge or more likely a tampon  well peggys got an airtight alibi  one two  gasps damn it  how would you feel about you and molly adopting a baby  it doesnt matter if it comes from her womb  or some teen mom in kentucky you still gotta raise it  well with adoption you get the exact model you want  if it was me id get a little japanese kid  theyre smart loyal  and they dont bring their shoes in the house  sure plus theyll do your taxes  walk on your back and chauffeur your green hornet car  are you telling me you wouldnt want to have your own little kato  of course who wouldnt  but you gotta be realistic  one day kates gonna need braces and wanna go to college  no kato dont need to go to college  hes gonna be street smart  plus if youre carrying a set of nunchucks  aint nobody gonna make fun of your teeth  cell phone rings groans  hey mom hows branson  well everybody cant be stupid  jim i dont know im at work  no im sure hes fine dont come home  look ill check on him and ill call you later  boy if she loved me half as much as she loves that dog  id weigh 130 pounds  you can certainly understand her worry  that dog is like a son to her  oh no she treats him way better than a son  shed give one of her kidneys to that ugly mutt but wouldnt  drive seven blocks to pick me up at school when i broke my arm  youre kidding  she said she was busy putting air on her toe knuckles  so she told me to hoof it  said you dont walk on your arm anyway  which is ironically how i broke it  cell phone rings sighs  hey molly whats up  jim swallowed a what  operate  well cant they just pull the string  molly tell that doctor whatever  has to do no matter how much it costs keep that dog alive  seriously if he needs a new heart come out take mine  that dog must live  hows he doing  theyre operating on him to remove the blockage  mike im so sorry about this  its not your fault it is  i left my purse open and laying around  i should be more responsible  hey some of this is on jim its not like your tampons  are made out of rawhide and wrapped in bacon  doesnt bode well for my lets have a baby campaign  ah dont be silly that mutts a garbage can  he once ate a keychain flashlight  pooped it halfway out and took off running  looked like he was having a movie premiere in his butt  i understand why youre nervous about having kids  and youre right it isnt something we should rush into  molly the truth is im just afraid i wont be a good dad  what are you talking about  my mom wasnt exactly the most compassionate person  or loving or tolerant or even nice to be around  i dont wanna pass that on to the next generation  are you kidding you are nothing like your mother  you are a joy to be around and your feet are smaller  youre just saying that cause you wanna have kids  i dont just want kids i want your kids  you are the kindest sweetest man that i have ever known  i dont even think i wanted to have kids before i met you  really  hey i teach fourth grade theres no better birth control than that  chuckling  well thanks to mom i certainly know what not to do  hmm  im guessing thats half the battle  and we can figure the rest out together  when the time is right  okay when the time is right  you can feed em and change em  and ill keep em from swallowing your lady things  laughs deal  ill just do what my mom used to do  when we went to the grocery store shed pull a pair of pantyhose over my head  i looked like a threeyear old bank robber but it kept me  from shoving a stick of deodorant in my mouth  im no fan of your mothers but thats actually brilliant  look at my baby boy  hes gonna be scarred up for the rest of his life  you dont think it looks manly kinda  kinda gives him like a rugged dont mess with me thing  if i wasnt afraid of leaving jim alone you and i would be  in the driveway right now settling this bareknuckle style  come on ma  your drivewayfighting days are behind you  tell that to the bouncer at gilleys  who tried to take away my coffee can full of dolores  hes gonna be fine the stitches come out in about  ten days and the vet said it wont leave much of a scar  then i can thank her for feeding my baby boy  one of her cotton pontoons  why cant you wear a pad like a normal person  cause theyre bulky and uncomfortable  and i feel like im sitting on a phone book i  plus i i lead an active lifest  fine ill wear one ill just strap it on  itll be a cold day in hell before i forget this  i trusted you to take care of the only thing in this world  i give a damn about  yeah ill bet youd drive seven blocks if he broke his arm  he wouldnt break his arm  showing off for the girls swim club  when you told me the story you didnt tell me there were girls involved  of course there were girls involved  why else would you try to walk on your hands  all right all right  we should be thankful that jim is healthy happy and  and loved  like you peggy  now why dont i go make us a sandwich  what are you gonna put in it rat poison  i was thinking about tuna fish but whatever you want  mike why dont you come help me  miracle whip not mayo  molly whatever you want mama biggs  hear that jim  whatever i want  this guilt trip might get me a granddaughter named peggy  or a grandson named jim  you know what that does make you look more rugged
