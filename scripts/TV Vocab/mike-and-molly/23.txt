                you know these egg whites arent bad i dont really miss the yolk at all  agreed they dont add anything to the overall egg experience  except maybe texture color and flavor  well in my mind this is a way better breakfast  than say a caramel frappuccino and a donut  oh absolutely  are we talking about the traditional glazed donut  or the more cakey kind  im talking about the little mini chocolate ones  you can have one on each finger and still hold a cup of coffee  you know theres a dunkin donuts  exactly onepointtwo miles from here  onepointtwo  and you know that how  i was going for my power walk and i was wearing my pedometer  by the way you can start smelling them at point eight  okay okay  we have really gotta stop this  what as long as were sticking to our diets  we can at least fantasize right  hey that snickers we shared in bed last night  was not a fantasy  it was to me  besides it was just a fun size  and we burned those calories off right away  if you know what i mean  technically i burned those calories off  yeah but i was rooting you on  and i appreciate that  but im gonna be good until victorias birthday party  and then im gonna have a piece of cake the size of my head  i thought your sister didnt want  to make a big deal about her birthday  its her thirtieth  its a milestone and were all having cake  end of discussion  boy i remember when i turned 30  me and a couple of buddies went to vegas  and we hooked up with these two  for one coupons to an allyoucaneat buffet  had a nice dinner went home early didnt do anything  ill never forget that night  morning  youre just getting home  yeah after the club closed  there was an after party in the parking lot  then an afterafter party in the bouncers popup camper  well bong hit bath and bed  party for your sister  good idea   i cant believe you ladies have never seen the godfather  ive tried to get joyce to watch it a thousand times  but we always end up watching some stupid chick flick  and im not talking the good girl on girl kind  well why dont you make her an offer that she cant refuse  i did  i said if i have to watch pretty woman one more time  youre gonna sleep with the fishes  i love pretty woman  it really makes being a hooker look like fun  shh  i believe in america  america has made my fortune  and i raised my daughter in the american fashion  whos this guy  are you gonna talk through the whole thing  sorry i just wanted to know who that guy is  youre not supposed to know who that guy is yet  fine ill wait  i gave her freedom but  i taught her never to dishonor her family  did you remember to order the cake for victorias birthday  no you know i wanted to ask you  do you think we should do cake or just cupcakes  ooh cupcakes  are a smart idea you dont waste as much  people can take them home if they want  this is the greatest movie ever  and all youre talking about is cupcakes  you know now that i hear it out loud i think im back to cake  are you done  sorry  with another boyfriend  they made her drink whiskey  hey what are you guys doing  oh just hanging out you want to join us  no  i dont want to intrude  dont be silly the more the merrier  not so far  thank you for asking  but youre doing a couples thing and  i dont want to be the sixth wheel  a lost and lonely  oh goodness do you want to go or should i  maybe you should both go  i just figured  by the time i turned 30 id have a man in my life  sweetie you have nothing but men in your life  no i mean the same man a bunch of nights in a row  some folks call that a relationship  yeah one of those  so the bouncer in the popup camper  probably not a longterm thing  oh no guys like that never are  neither are guys who live in winnebagos or hotdog trucks  good to know  you show up for a second date  and their whole house has disappeared  no note or nothing  just an orange extension cord hanging from the outlet  and a halfeaten bun on the curb  victoria you shouldnt pin your happiness  on whether you have a man in your life or not  easy for you to say  youve got a boyfriend  you want him hes yours  i gotta warn you hes kind of a load  yeah but at least you have somebody to be disappointed in  listen youve gotta  youve gotta focus on what makes you happy  you know i mean your job brings you  a lot of fulfillment right  well  putting makeup on dead people is okay  but as a rule they dont give you a lot of pats on the back  hey i dont get a lot of attaboys as a teacher either  but i know if im reaching just one kid  then im truly making a difference  just one kid  thats so great  it is  its just all in how you choose to look at it  youre telling me i should have a baby  uh  mom  coming anyway victorias always been my fragile one  it all started when she was five years old  and i lost her at the zoo  not entirely my fault  i mean if theyre gonna sell beer there  mistakes will be made  i think you should go talk to her whats going on  she wants to have a baby  and she sent me down here to ask mike for sperm  you lovingly declined  oh thank you  because i never know what to say in those situations  lets go vince  if youre gonna be her step daddy youre gonna have to  start chiming in with some fatherly advice  ah geez i just wanted a nice quiet evening  watching a bunch of goombahs  blast the crap out of each other  why did you go to the police  why didnt you come to me first  so whos this guy  sweetheart raising a child is a lot of responsibility  theres dressing them and feeding them  and not losing them in monkeyville  i was hammered give me a break  i just feel like ive got so much to give  and nobody to give it to  you ever think about pole dancing  vince what is the matter with you  hey its good money great exercise  and shes bringing happiness to  a room full of sad and lonely degenerates  i think what vince is trying to say  is that maybe this is not a good time  for you to have a baby  no what vince is trying to say  is that youve got a rocking bod  and you should take advantage of it  before you hit 40 and your jugs become wind chimes  mom make him stop talking  vince get out of here and go watch your movie  hey she could push it to 45  if she sleeps in a support bra and stays off the trampoline  out  here take this up to my sister  itll make her feel better  oh man why you doing this to me  youll be fine  you got enough for a backup  if i accidentally eat this on the stairs  go  just so you know  if she asks for my sperm  im trading her straight up for this bad boy  oh hey i was just bringing a little treat for victoria  oh good i need a drink  funny i was schnockered when she was conceived  and now its the only way  i can carry on a conversation with her  hey there  molly made a little treat for you and i didnt eat any of it  aw thats so sweet of her  yep  can i have it  oh right right  ever since i was a little girl  if i was feeling sad  shed make me a hot fudge sundae  with three oreos

on the uniform and strapping on the sidearm  and serving the people that im sworn to protect  so helping people makes you happy  yeah that and  feeling like im a part of something important  you know something bigger than me  oh my god  its all so clear to me now  really yes  its obvious what i have to do  whats that  ive gotta join the army  molly  one hot beef and cheese sandwich with curly fries  and strawberry shake  and one can of tuna  thank you  while youre enjoying that  ill get your scratching post and squeaky mouse  i hope he gets fat someday  you know im proud of you  youve been showing a lot of selfcontrol lately  yesterday molly had me take her sister a hot fudge sundae  and i didnt eat one bite of it  and i had plenty of time alone with it too  she never wouldve known  they never do  to this day nobody at the station can figure out  why the jellyfilled donuts were sucked dry  before the box was even opened  thats just pulling the fire alarm  and when no ones looking  jamming a straw into the jelly reservoir  well its brilliant  youre like foodini  hey guys  hey sweetie what are you doing here  well per your conversation with victoria  she decided to check out the army recruiting office  and see if she could be all she could be  turns out i cant  i had no idea the army was so strict  i mean the whole thing is just rules rules rules  its no wonder theyre always fighting with someone somewhere  i will say you do make that uniform look very good  thank you  seriously ive been standing at attention  since you walked through the door  at ease carl  i just dont

savior  carl  can i walk on that path with you  carl  take my hand and we will walk it together  oh dear god  amen  do you know how many games im missing right now  suck it up were being supportive

waters of lake michigan  did you happen to bring a white tshirt  im afraid not  oh thats cool i got a few in the trunk of my car  carlton you need to get your robe on  and take over the keyboard for
