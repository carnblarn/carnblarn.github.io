amen  so you seem good  everything okay  well weve all got our crosses to bear  but apparently the good lord has made mine  out of lead and covered it in fire ants  but whatever  his will be done  well you have been rough a lot lately  i mean with your boyfriend dying so suddenly and all  well thats what men do they leave  dennis left in a body bag  and mikes dad left in a chrysler imperial  with his bowling trophy and a homewrecking whore  and im guessing youre also feeling  a little abandoned by your son about now too  oh is that what this little lunch date is all about  what  think you can wine and dine me  with a two dollar government meal  then get me to spill my guts  like its daddy touched me week on dr phil  peggy please keep your voice down  let me tell you something i may be old  lonely and heartbroken  cast aside by my own flesh and blood  but youll never hear me complaining about it  oh no  you suffer in silence  damn right  peggy biggs is not a bellyacher  when life deals me a crap hand i play it  aw go i cant eat this  hey bright eyes  think you can rustle me up some hot sauce  before you walk the green mile  shes going through the change  lets hope second times a charm  i know you said no more meat but these pork chops  followed me me me all the way home  well youre not grilling them this sunday  cause were spending it with your mom  youre kidding me  i thought you jumped on that hand grenade with lunch  i did  its your turn to take a little shrapnel  you know since you moved in here  you hardly see her at all anymore  i rush over there every time she calls  and its usually just to check the bushes  for skunks or peeping toms  by the way in 15 years  one skunk no peeping toms  well  i think she might appreciate you  just dropping by for no other reason  than youre her son and you love her  i dont know that might make her a little suspicious  well here  take her cookie container back to her  aw man you guys ate all of em  i never got one  oh  i tell you you look very pretty tonight  doorbell rings  peggy who is it  its me mike  the only mike i know is my son  and hes been mia since he got a girlfriend  so hit the bricks sicko  alright mom you made your point  i feel terrible  now open the door  sorry i didnt clean up  but i wasnt expecting company  ever  whats going on  youre sleeping on the couch now yeah  right next to my two best friends  the tv and the toilet  and now youre letting jim just eat from a 50pound bag of dog food  hey if i die in my sleep i figure that buys me  about a week before he starts gnawing at my sweetbreads  geez hes like a ham in a dog suit  you should see the size of his stools  the other day he had to lay on his side to finish  all right mom listen to me  i realize ive been very remiss as a son lately  i dont blame you boy  i understand you got a woman now  and shes dragging you around by your tickle stick  okay  i promise ill come around more  but you gotta meet me halfway  the arbys on cicero  no  i mean you gotta pull yourself together  you cant just mope around the house all the time  pretty soon jims legs wont be long enough  to keep his wiener off the ground  oh  hush now hes very selfconscious about his weight  the point is youre a strong woman a survivor  and it breaks my heart to see you wallowing in selfpity  thats because you dont know what s like to wake up  voice breaking and feel so all alone  youre right i dont  ive always had an amazing woman in my life  taking care of me  and nobodys ever going to replace her  sighing aw im just an old tired broad  ready for the scrap heap  dont talk that way  you didnt roll over and give up when dad left  groans maybe you should think about getting a job again  meet new people  you know have someplace go every day  and do what  sweep hair at the supercuts  read to the geezers at the old folks home  hand out samples of summer sausage  to the moochers at the grocery store  all im saying is you still got a lot to offer  i am good with people  you do have a gift  hey do you need any help around the police station  no we do not  but im sure somewhere theres a place  that youd fit right in hmm  whats in the chefs stew  whimpers  so far ive fished out two cigarette butts  and a shoelace  what do you think you want to roll the dice  yeah i think its a great idea  for your mom to start working again  thats why i let my grandma do little odd jobs for me  it keeps her young  well she must feel like a teenager  when shes laying under your truck changing the oil  yeah  its worth the 20 bucks i give her  just to see that happy greasy smile on her face  cell phone rings  oh its molly  hey sweetie whats going on  really  my mom got a job at mollys school   thats great  thats great  its not  its not great  meatball sub  bacon double cheeseburger  uh no no those are for carl  bacon double cheeseburger i only eat meat on the weekends  im having cottage cheese and sliced peaches  i cant be a part of this

chocolate milkshake this is gonna take a while  really so you have no idea  why i wasnt invited to that faculty meeting  none the email should have gone out to everybody  but youre the one that sends the emails out  everyone else got it  do you know how to work your email  yes i do  and your address is still jollymolly77  close cubfan4  my bad  it will not happen again  thank you  forced laugh

make a quick phone call  well  i brought you some premium wedges  figured you could take some home to the boy  thats sweet peggy i appreciate it  mind if i join you  uh sure  i usually put in  a swirl of peanut butter but apparently now  every kid in the world cant even look at a nut  without his head swelling up like a ballpark frank  yeah peanut allergies are actually pretty serious thing  thats because were raising a generation  of thinskinned sissies  i hear they dont even keep score  at sporting events anymore  well they dont want the kids to go home  and feel like a loser  some of them are losers  and the sooner they embrace that  the less chance theyll be crouching in a bell tower  with a highpowered rifle and a picture of the president  wow  well if at all possible  wewe try not to refer to the students as losers  ive heard you say worse  i was kidding  and that was at home  and that was before you and i had a professional relationship  which is the type of  relationship we should maintain while were on schoolgrounds  oh i get it  professor high horse doesnt want to be seen  with lola the lunch lady  no no thats not what im saying  im just not comfortable with my personal life  mixing with my professional life  dont worry from now on im just a faceless slop jockey  sighs  come on you dont need to be so dramatic about it  hey thats the way it is  lunch ladies are invisible  but on the plus side  i hear little kids talking about cheating on tests  teachers talking about cheating on their spouses  um whats that  all im saying is that chippy i saw crossing out of here  sure is playing with fire  rebecca  what are you talking about shes not married  no but the principal is  shes doing it with the principal  you didnt hear that from me  and i didnt hear it from the janitor  well i better shimmy back down the totem pole  hey hey hey hey hey  hey what are you  what are you doing i thought we were gonna  have some brownies  doesnt strike me as very professional  oh come on were both off the clock  and were family  mom  wait are you saying that distribution of school funds  is decided by the principals secretary  not officially  but shes definitely the bluehaired puppet master  because shes got the skinny on her boss  and by skinny i mean photos  get out  laughs  what do you hear about the vice principal job  am i still the front runner  ah thats enough shop talk for one day  we can gab more on sunday  when you and mikey come over for dinner  oh sunday   mm gosh i think  ill make a roast  and we can discuss you and mikey
