                1 carlton michaels out front  and youre going to be late for work again  poke your head out the door  and tell him ill be there in a minute  if i poke anything anywhere its going to be  my house slipper up your behind  tomorrow im waking that boy up  with kerosene and a box of matches  hey michael  hi nana  let me get you a cup of tea baby  what id really like is for carl  to stop using my car horn as his snooze alarm  its like trying  to rouse the dead this morning  had to pull his covers down  and snap a wet towel at his behind  truth be told he woke up when i pulled down the covers  but i had to make it fun for me  boy hes really been burning the candle  at both ends lately huh  walked in my door at 300 this morning  with the devils grin on his face  and stripper glitter in his teeth  hey man  im almost ready i just need  a couple of more minutes to moisturize  better not be using my good face cream  on them ashy elbows of yours  ill stop using your face cream  when you stop ruining my good razor  on them wiryass chin whiskers  what did i tell you about mentioning  my chin whiskers in front of company  its really just the one but i aint going to lie  you could tow a boat with that thing  your secrets safe with me  michael can i ask you something  no i cannot see it from here  thank you baby  but what i was wondering is if you know any girls  for anything serious right now  hes still kind of sowing his wild oats  well if he keeps carrying on the way he is  im going to be sewing him into his bedsheets  and beating him with a bag of oranges  you know what ill keep my eyes open  all right if the two of you can wrap up the chitchat  then maybe i wont be late for work  if i killed him youd give me  a head start wouldnt you  for the first time in my life   i see love    mmm  man i really appreciate you driving today  happy to do it  is this the farthest the seat goes back  the problem aint how far it goes back  its how far you go forward  every time i turn the wheel my shirt comes untucked  well ii can drive if you want me to  ah relax you look beat  i did party pretty late last night  one of the dancers and i made a real connection  connection like her hair extensions  got caught in your zipper connection  hey dont make it dirty  no this was a spiritual thing  she gave me a threesong lap dance  but only charged me for two  you sure she just wasnt bad at math  that was my first thought too but then i saw her  adding her tips up at the end of the night  girl was like rain man in a gstring  tell me carl you ever feel like maybe  youre wasting your naturally loving nature  on shall we say skanks  ah i see  just because a woman takes money  to shake her naked butt in your face  that makes her a skank  well it is one of the warning signs  i just think you deserve better  what about a nice girl from your church  i already tried hooking up with them twofaced baptist women  theyll rock your world on saturday night  come sunday morning theyre repenting their sins  in front of the whole congregation  and them bitches name names  sorry  just trying to get comfortable  hey remind me to order a tuna melt for molly  so i can drop it off for her at work ah thats thoughtful  you see carl its important in a relationship  to go the extra mile for your lady  make them feel special  let them know youre thinking about them  yeah surprise them a little  its not that much of a surprise  she told me to do it this morning  whoa man  whered she come from  theres not a hospital around here  the lab coat doesnt necessarily mean doctor  they wear them behind the makeup counter at the mall  and in some of your fancier candy stores  no no shes carrying a tiny flashlight  in her pocket which means  either optometrist or proctologist  well heads or tails  either way you win right  why dont you go talk to her  oh she aint my type  what do you mean  shes a beautiful professional woman  ageappropriate doesnt have a ring on her finger  exactly im thinking damaged goods  either divorced with a bunch of cats  or one of them legs is aluminum  well theres only one way to find out  man i aint going over there and kicking  that woman in the leg  hey samuel  you see that woman in the lab coat over there  what do you know about her  not much uh her name is christina  mid30s optometrist  moved here three months ago from michigan  she works down the street  orders lunch from here every day and picks it up at 1245  usually a chicken sandwich on wheat with light mayo  she will sometimes order pie for dessert  unless she had dessert the night before and then no pie  uh do you know if shes married or has a boyfriend  shes currently unattached and not interested in dating  at least not a certain senegalese waiter  who gave her free pickle spears for a month  and bought a pair of 300 reading glasses  that he doesnt even need  may i take your order  look just because she turned samuel down  doesnt mean shes going to turn you down  well just go by her work  you walk in and introduce yourself  and then what  pretend i need glasses like samuel did  please he ended up not getting a date  and looking like african urkel  well at least he doesnt walk up to strange women in bars  and tell them theyre under arrest for disturbing the pants  why are you so interested in my love life all of a sudden  i just think the right woman is out there for you carl  but shes not hanging from a pole  or lifting her shirt at a bears game  hey your bachelor days may be dead and buried  but dont grab me with your zombie hand  and drag me into your sadass grave  hey molly how you doing cutie  hey carl  wheres the grub bub  ah theres a twolip delivery charge  outrageous i thought it was included  curly fries are getting cold maam  you drive a hard bargain officer  thanks for doing this my pleasure  i couldve grabbed something from the cafeteria  but then i wouldnt get to see your cute face  well you work so hard  and i really like taking care of you  i dont know what id do without you  youd have about six more curly fries i can tell you that  molly ah only six  you are a strong strong man  i better get back in there  before they start huffing the permanent markers  love you i love you too  bye carl  all right go ahead take your best shot  my bachelor days are done and im just a lovestruck loser  with nothing but a lifetime of this to look forward to  quit rubbing it in man  what you have is beautiful  ive got two women in my life  remember you dont need to come on too strong  this is just a meet and greet  a get to know carl mcmillan  i shouldnt be meeting a woman right now  my eyes are puffy my nails are ragged  and im not wearing my sharpshooter medal  listen this is not about medals or bragging  about how many marine pushups you can do  yeah 86  impressive but irrelevant  those are the kind you clap in the middle  i know but youre not here to show off  you just want to give her a little peek  of whats in here without too much  coming out of here  so keep it mysterious is what youre saying  yes mysteriously nontalkative  all right whats our cover  your eyes are fine but your partners  having trouble driving at night  oh i get it  the old partner cant see at night routine  exactly  and uh youre such a good friend you insisted  that i come here and get my eyes checked  okay then what  then you talk to her  but not too much focus on listening  well is that it  cause thats pretty thin and drastically unsexy  were not shooting for sexy  then bullseye  oh man this would be so much easier  if she was a proctologist  what are you talking about  that way she couldnt see the fear in my eyes  well i think proctologists can sense fear too  look just take a deep breath and try not to talk  unless absolutely necessary  hey oh  good afternoon officers how can i help you  yeah ive been having  a little trouble with night vision  and my partner and very good friend carl  is worried about me driving  the other night i had to grab the wheel  to keep him from mowing down  three old ladies and a baby duck  oh my god thats horrible  well the old ladies are fine but im still  not ready to talk about the baby duck  carl sorry  anyway he insisted that i march  right in here and get an eye exam  well im pretty booked up for the rest of the day  can you come back tomorrow  yes what time do you open  it doesnt have to be  first thing in the morning  uh this area is part of our beat  so anytime is fine with us  well let me see what we have  andand just so you know  the two of us keep a very close eye  on this neighborhood  unless its at night then its all on me  i can see some stuff  im not completely blind  anyway uh heres our card  just call me when something opens up  uh carl why dont you write down your cell number  in case she needs to reach us directly  thats a great idea  uh call me anytime  if it goes to voice mail im probably  in the middle of a car chase or a shootout  and dont assume  theres anything weird about this  we give this kind of personal attention  to all the businesses around here  oh good cause i was thinking  this is either the worst shakedown of all time  or you guys are hitting on me  no no no no no no no no  but suppose one of us  was checking the temperature of the water  well you would find that water very tepid  oh really  tepids not good carl  im sorry im just not interested  oh  all right i understand  youre an independent educated woman  and im just a dumb beat cop  with just two years of junior college  thats not what im saying  you dont have to say anything  i can see it by the way  youre looking down your nose at me  carl let it go no  ive been holding my tongue ever since we walked in here  i know you think thats true  and thats your biggest problem  guys ii dont have time for this  i have a patient waiting for me  patient youre not even a real doctor  all right lets go  and this aint nothing but a glorified sunglass hut  if she calls the cops on us its going to be very awkward  carl why are you so upset  you get rejected by women all the time  at least this one didnt blast you with pepper spray  that fake lady doctor embarrassed me in public  well luckily it was at an optometrists office  and none of the witnesses could actually make a positive id  this is all just a big joke to you isnt it  telling me to wear my heart on my sleeve and then laughing  when she cuts off my arm and beats me with it  is that what you heard  because to me it was just a polite no from a busy woman  my mistake was letting you do all the talking for me  just because you got a girlfriend all of a sudden  you think youre the professor of love  im not saying i know everything  its just of the two of us  im the one whos in a serious relationship  and that was just blind luck  like when a monkey writes a book  look i know youre upset  i think youre jealous because im living the life  you always wished you had and now that youre engaged  you aint never gonna have it  hey you were the one crying at the school  saying you wanted what i got  hey you know how emotional i get when im sleep deprived  thats why i never watch the color purple  unless im fully rested  okay from now on ill stay out of your life  you want to spend every night picking up  bar flies and cop groupies thats your business  and business is just fine thank you very much  maybe you should stop worrying about me  and take care of your own affairs  whats that supposed to mean  well instead of butting into my life  maybe you should start thinking about  why your fiance is working late every night  hey her job is important  and shes got a lot of responsibilities  unlike your girlfriends who just have to remember  to windex the pole when theyre done working  im just saying mollys got a desk and books at home  my girls got to go where the pole is  so hows everything going at work honey  well the funeral home just hired a lady mortician  and i think she might be kind of sweet on me  you sure shes not just being overly nice on her first day  i made the same assumption about the new sparkletts gal  is that why we have to pick up the bottles at the curb  yeah apparently she greets everyone with  mind if i grab your jugs  ah there he is  how was your day  dont ask  carl was a bigger pain in the ass than usual today  hes like a hemorrhoid with a badge  wheres molly  not here must be working late  again  damn it  look i understand she wants  this vice principal job and that means  putting in some extra hours  and nobody has been more supportive of that than me  right am i right  absolutely very supportive right absolutely  and i understand that  in a mature relationship you have to be flexible  this is not me still wishing i was single  or being jealous of any other knucklehead that is  didnt even go there of course not  i mean come on molly and i are still in the early throes  of love and we never spend any time together anymore  we love your company aw thats horrible  you know what im gonna do  im gonna pack up a picnic and surprise her at work  im not giving up on romance  ill show her we still got it  no matter what anybody else says  i didnt say anything wouldnt dare  now if you ladies are done im gonna take the rest  of this food and turn it into a magical dinner for two  all yours pack it up romeo  carlton why arent you at the strip club  you better get moving before  all the other perverts get the ringside seats  im not going out tonight  im just gonna watch a little tv and go to bed  well if you dont show up how are them poor girls  gonna pay their rent or buy their narcotics  leave me alone grandma  just go to your bible study class  i can get there a little bit late  were studying deuteronomy  and all them shalt nots  put a damper on the drinking and trash talking  whats troubling you  do you think im ever gonna find a nice girl  you know somebody i can really settle down with  you could if you tried  but you cant shake the whore tree  and expect an angel to fall out  i just dont feel like a really good woman  would go for a guy like me  why not  youre a fine decent  goodlooking boy with a big loving heart  youre my grandma you have to say that  i dont have to say anything  and i aint blind to your flaws  many a time i had to use one hand  to pull the other one away from your throat  but i didnt raise you to be thinking youre not good enough  because you are  and if you found the right girl  and showed her the man i see every day  youd have yet another good woman in your life  who loves you for who you are  thanks grandma  i love you too  but when you do find a girl  dont think you got to share  everything about yourself all at once  let her make peace with your leopard skin man thong  before you start stealing her lady lotions  that reminds me i used all your cocoa butter  get out of my house  hey teach  honey what are you doing here  you missed dinner so i thought  id surprise you with a little picnic  oh my god i completely lost track of the time  we can have some food  perhaps a little splash of vino  actually were not allowed  to have alcohol on the school premises  right like none of you teachers keep a bottle of hooch  hidden in your desk or inside the guinea pig cage  youd probably find some wild turkey in the wood shop  but that guy loses a finger a year  all right well we can still enjoy a nice dinner together  and maybe for dessert  something sweet and naughty in the teachers lounge  oh i dont know itd be weird  i have sex in there all the time with the janitor  im kidding im kidding  i just dont think itd be a good idea  okay i shouldnt have dropped in unannounced  i was trying to be spontaneous and romantic  and now i just feel stupid  no no come on  its so sweet  showing up here with a little picnic basket  you know how many times your mom and sister said  hey where you going yogi  a lot  three times at the house and once in a text message  look ii know ive been putting in tons of extra hours  and i really appreciate your patience  its just i never get to see you anymore  i got nobody to gripe about my day to  except your mom and your sister  yeah theyre not very good listeners are they  the worst its like talking to a bottle of wine and a bong  youd think one of them would know how to say  its gonna be all right sweetie  it is gonna be all right sweetie  see you dont even know what im talking about  and you made me feel better  im gonna make it up to you  tomorrow night romantic evening  just you and me  you dont have to do that  hey i want to  missing goes both ways buddy  hey you know what  i can take a little break  crack this picnic basket open  really yeah  i need a little fianc time  know what open that bottle of wine  what if somebody walks in  ill just tell them its yours yogi  whatever you say booboo  hey  remember me  you kind of look like this crazy cop that came by earlier  but uh i cant imagine him showing his face again  yeah look about that  im sorry for the way that went down  i wasnt trying to be mean  im just not interested in dating anyone right now  i understand and im not here to press the issue  i just wanted a chance to explain myself  you dont owe me any explanations  although an apology for that not a doctor comment  might be in order  yeah that was my bruised ego talking  i get intimidated by women of your caliber  my caliber  yeah  youre beautiful smart successful  and can see right through a guy like me  hey its your life  if you want to be a player thats your business  i just dont have time for that  see heres the thing im not really a player  i mean i am but im not really good at it  are you playing me right now  no  unless its working for you  look im sure youre a nice guy  but i already live with a nice guy  oh and hes six years old  you have a kid  yeah so if you want to turn and run  the exit to the sunglass hut is right there  you kidding me i love kids  really yeah  i mean i dont have any of my own but i used to be one  my grandma says i still am  by the way i live with my grandma  youre kidding no i should probably  stop talking right about now  no no keep going  im starting to see youre really not  much of a player at all  oh no what you saw was just a handsome facade  im really a mess inside  yeah no matter how many medals ive won  or how many marine pushups i can do   those are the kind that you clap in the middle  yeah i know those kind  im serious i can do those  im sure you can  you know i cant believe  i thought you were stuck up when i first saw you  so it turns out the lady mortician is a lesbian  but im apparently not her type  howd you find that out  i asked her if she was a lesbian and she said yes  then i asked her if i was her type and she said no  hey big boy  your fiances upstairs  and we were told to deliver this message to you personally  now serving dessert in the teachers lounge  she means the bedroom  but we didnt read it  mmmm  excuse me ladies      i love you molly flynn
