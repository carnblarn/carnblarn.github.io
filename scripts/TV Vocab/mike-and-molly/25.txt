 i cant believe its actually mine  thats because its not  but it will be after 48 easy monthly payments  it might have been cheaper to buy you an engagement car  i love you mike  i love you mrs biggs  oh thats sweet  but about that  would you be terribly hurt if i didnt take your last name  what i just think its better  for me professionally to keep my last name  professionally youre a teacher  just go to the chalkboard  erase ms flynn and write mrs biggs  really  im rubenesque i teach fourth graders  you want me to go in there with the last name biggs  yeah fourth graders are a pretty hateful bunch  i remember how much we tortured poor old mr jahboner  jahboner  you gotta be kidding me  nope and he taught wood shop  well you live by the sword you die by the sword  so youre okay with me keeping my name  yeah thats fine  mrs biggs reminds me of my mother anyway  and thats a real jahboner killer  thank you  so are we thinking about a church wedding or  actually i was thinking  does your bra unhook in the front or the back  on the other hand  having an outdoor ceremony could be really beautiful  maybe lincoln park  spring time the flowers are gorgeous  sure  so its settled  spring time lincoln park  great  ah  but if we want to have an indoor reception weve got to  you know set up a banquet hall at least a year in advance  great then we got plenty of time  okay then were talking a year from now  yeah well start ironing out the details a year from now  no wait wait wait wait  roll up your tongue  are you are you saying that were not gonna get married  for at least two years  no im not saying that  what are you saying  im trying not to say anything  look the important thing is  you have a ring on your finger that says  im marrying the man of my dreams  and the bra is off  see i told you you could do it  i dont have to switch to velcro  for the first time in my life   i see love    that was a nice shindig last night  yeah i cant believe my little girls getting married  me too i thought she was a lesbian when i first met her  morning  morning buttercup  wheres your bigger half  he left for work  so how was your first night as an engaged woman  hmm its different now right  i know when vince proposed to me  we connected on a whole new level  that was a godgiven stiffy that night too  no pills just pure adrenaline  you get that shes my mother right  which reminds me  if you need someone to walk you down the aisle  i would be honored  no tis i the lesbian that would be honored  i told you your voice carries  when mike and i set a date  i will definitely consider your offer  try to avoid the summer  we morantos are a sweaty people  and i dont want my hair paint to run  yeah and for me try to avoid the winter months  when my little girl gets married  i want to wear something low cut show off my bouncy cs  like a mother does  were not even talking specifics yet  dont let him drag the engagement out  guys will take a free meal as long as they can get it  and by free meal i mean copulation  its gonna be a long walk down that aisle  man i cant get over it  my best friend is getting married yep  wasnt but a year ago you were whining and crying  about how lonely you were yep  sitting in your sad little apartment all weekend  one hand down a bag of doritos the other one down your pants  yeah well those were some dark days dark  you sir are an inspiration  to overweight masturbators everywhere  you know what why dont you save the rest  for your best man speech  so its official im your best man  and that is the real tragedy of my life  im honored  so is it safe to assume  that you wont be goin fishin with us this weekend  why wouldnt i go  youre engaged now  you cant just be doing what you want  and making your own decisions and stuff  excuse me but my life is still very much my own  i can come and go as i please  mike flynn is his own man  mike flynn  biggs i said biggs  everybody heard biggs shut up  sounded like flynn from

hulk got mad  im just trying to narrow things down  i mean if you want the good weather  theres only a handful of weekends to choose from  shes right and if shes gonna do all the planning  you can at
