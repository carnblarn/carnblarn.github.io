center  spreadeagled in stirrups  screaming get this monster out of me  did i tell you not to bring it up  you did  thank god it was in the days before video  otherwise wed still be watching game tapes  well anyway i think it might be fun  to throw a little party this year we usually go to the ihop  he eats for free and i get the senior discount  were in and out for six bucks  650 if moms in a tipping mood mmhmm  hey if i got to hold my coffee cup in the air  like the statue of liberty every time i need a refill  rosarita can live off the money she skims from the till  besides were not really a partythrowing kind of family  you mean youve never had a birthday party  i threw him one when he turned nine  and that is a nightmare i will not repeat  here we go  decorated the house invited all the neighbor kids  even the poor ones with crooked teeth and dirty necks  the cateneso twins  their dad drank  so what happened  well the birthday boy ate three hamburgers  four quarterhunks of cake  and a plastic reagan head full of jelly bellys  i got overexcited  it was my birthday  barfday is more like it  he started spraying like a water wiggle full of urp  people were running out of here like they were on the poseidon  during pin the tail on the donkey  when they blindfolded me and spun me around  it kind of all went south  it went south north east and west  ive been finding whole jelly beans for years after  its like he didnt even chew em  she gets the picture ma  i can almost smell it  well it is the same couch  who wants peach cobbler  for the first time in my life   i see love   here this is the woman ive been telling you about  she is also from africa  that picture aint africa  thats lincoln park  i recognize the hotdog vendor  gary  or jerry  shes a beautiful woman if that is indeed her real picture  what are you talking about  people lie all the time on these dating sites  i once tried hooking up with this hot filipino chick  ended up being a short guatemalan man named roberto  oh yeah he was a nice guy mm  real sweetheart bought dinner that night  and taught me how to salsadance  well amira is who she says she is  we have emailed on several occasions  and tonight were meeting facetoface  i hope it works out for you pal me too  most of my success stories came on the international love sites  your russian czechoslovakian ukrainian  when they dont speak english  it gives him a twoweek head start before they realize  hes full of crap in any language  laughs  two weeks is more than enough time to do what i need to do  and a couple of things i thought i wanted to do  but once i did them i wish i hadnt  im actually hoping for something more substantial  and longterm  a soul mate who appreciates me for who i am  and i hope thats on your profile page  cause thats the kind of crapski  that can get a comrade laidski  never mind him samuel  im glad youre being honest  and starting things off on the right foot  thank you mike  oh by the way may i borrow your car tonight  what do you need my car for  i told her i had a car  it seemed slightly more impressive than telling her  i had four days left on my bus pass  thats good but try to keep the lies to a minimum  otherwise after two weeks youre gonna have  some angry ukrainian bitch demanding to see  the rocks you collected on your moon walk  his mom hasnt thrown him a birthday party  since he was nine  thats so sad  well youve met her  shes a hideous woman  guess that explains why hes 35 never been married  and puts his belt on with a boomerang  so his weight issues are because  of his relationship with his mother  what does that say about you and me  youre bigboned and have a hearty appetite  now pipe down and get mama some more wine  okay mama  so are

this  she can be a bitch  you got to start pumping the brakes  about a half a block before you get to a stop sign  yeah and if you think youre gonna stop short  keep your hand on the emergency brake  and be prepared to yank that sucker  like your life depends on it cause it does  other than that have fun  okay uh thanks  ill have it back to you tomorrow morning  not if you park on a hill you wont  so what are you doing for your birthday this year  i guess its just me and mom at the ihop  youre welcome to join us if you want  watching you wolf down a belgian waffle  with strawberry compote while your mom describes  what a blood bath your birth was  no thank you  good morning my brothers from another mother  what a glorious day it is  wow  sounds like somebodys date went pretty well huh  amira was more beautiful than her pictures  it was a perfect evening  hey you didnt do it in my car did you  well as much as i wanted to consummate our attraction  on a vinyl car seat covered in arbys wrappers  i chose to wait until we had proper courtship  plus she wouldnt let me  so whered you take her  we had a fivecourse dinner at the florentine  and split a bottle of champagne  and she still wouldnt give it up  every one of them online svetlanas was good to go  after a roach coach taco and a can of fosters lager  look i dont want to pry samuel  but that sounds like a pretty expensive evening  for a man of shall we say meager means  what mike is wondering  is how a broke assschmuck like you  is paying for all this crap  i gleaned that on my own carl  last nights magic was courtesy  of my now maxedout discover card  and how long do you plan on maintaining  this level of costly sexless courtship  well i was hoping you gentlemen would either loan me the money  or leave me a 700 tip  hey look i already let you borrow my car  which you still havent returned by the way  thats right  here are the keys  thank you  amira was very impressed with your car  the valet at the restaurant eh not so much  hello samuel  oh my goodness there she is  i have missed you so much  i missed you too  wow i got to get back to africa and embrace my roots  me too  amira these are my friends mike and carl  gentlemen this is amira  hi hi amira  nice to meet you  samuel has spoken so highly of both of you  but he did not mention how handsome and masculine you are  well  guys dont talk that way about other guys  even if it is true  especially when its true  so to what do i owe this wonderful surprise  i was just hoping that after you closed up your restaurant  we could go for a drive in your mitsubishi cadillac  i would love that  oh right  thanks for loaning me your cadillac  did you remember to put gas back in it  sadly no  heres 20 to cover it  its a big tank  glad i didnt borrow samuels car  and believe it or not  i got mikes mom to agree to a party at her place  wow howd you do that  i agreed to clean up his cake vomit  thats fair  and when he comes to pick her up to go to ihop  surprise  shh  whispering surprise  so what do we do when he comes down for breakfast  pretend we forgot its his birthday  no  no no classic mistake  acknowledge it the way you normally would  but dont go overboard  itll make him suspicious  kind of like when you get pulled over by the cops  when youre high on weed  you want to act straight  but not too straight  i never thought i would say this  but you are absolutely right  morning ladies hey sweetie  happy birthday  thats right it is my birthday  congratulations officer  i realize youre just doing your job  well im not treating you

talking about  that was real  well your real is totally unbelievable  i mean we need you to appear excited but dont act like  they just called your name on the price is right  carl dont worry about it  i can handle this  its like when somebody sets you up with a sure thing  i mean you know eventually her clothes are gonna come off  but when they do you got to act like  oh my goodness what an unexpected treat  otherwise that poor girls just gonna feel like a whore  i get it  surprised but not too surprised  and look tonight i need you to keep an eye on me  dont let me eat too much or get overexcited  so my whole nights gonna be spent  keeping cake out of that mouth  do i get to wear falcon gloves and carry a tennis racket  im just asking you as a friend to keep an eye on me  fine i will limit you to one piece of nanas cake  and shes been working on it all morning  so try and act surprised but not too surprised  nanas making a cake  oh man this is the best birthday ever  see that right there is too much  if id acted that way  with the sure thing she wouldve put her top back on  and kicked me out of that toll booth  ill take care of the streamers you and mom start  blowing up balloons got it  maybe dust a little  take a rag to these windows  sure right after we delouse the carpet  oh im sorry is my mud hut  not fancy enough for your snazzy todo  no we just thought we could spruce things up a little  well if youre feeling in a mary poppins kind of mood  the upstairs crapper is sporting four shades of ugly  well just hang more balloons  and try to keep the guests downstairs  here we go all right  old lady coming through  loudly okay nana were here  watch that carpet  you dont want to fall down and break a hip  tell this fool to quit yelling at me  before i slap the grecian formula out of his hair  spry old chicken isnt she  you want to sit down nana take a load off  if im as feeble as you think i am  then why aint you carrying my damn cake  i got a bad back  and i didnt want you to feel completely useless  hey nana let me take that  you didnt park in front of the house did you  i parked down the street like you told me  made me lug my cake a block and a half the whole time  trying to talk me into buying a racehorse  i was offering you an investment opportunity thatll take care  of you in your dotage which lets be honest is almost over  im gonna kill this man  wait till after the party and well all help  1400  the woman at the store said that if i bought this dress  that i had to buy the shoes and i had to buy the earrings  1400  thats okay right  of course  im a successful restauranteur not some poor waiter  who has to sell his blood and semen just to pay for it  samuel im late for the party  give me the keys  you mean the keys to the cadillac  yes  funny story mike  amira was late for her pedicure and needed to borrow my car  and whats the punch line  towed wrecked or stolen  misplaced  but look at her  cant expect her to be smart too  may i borrow 1400  ooh car car car  car car car  everybody hide  oh nope  nice car false alarm  all groaning  man its been an hour since i dropped him off  and he knows were all waiting here for him  carl  im sorry he knows what  what  carl  hang on now  you guys were the ones acting weird  making him all suspicious  and all i did was just confirm those suspicions  mike didnt want to hurt your feelings  by letting on that he knew  really  thats sweet  and mike told carl not to tell you  so i guess thats two secrets that youve blown today  way to go doubleo stupid  oh this might be him  he already knows  whats wrong with you people  both moaning  knock it off  its a city bus not the tunnel of love  sorry  excuse me  i will enjoy the new nano you bought me  chuckles softly  what  my party started over an hour ago  and every time this bus makes another stop  i hate you a little more  i know mike but look at her  isnt she adorable  yes she is but how long do you think  you can keep up this ruse   thats only if i can get somebody  to buy one of my kidneys  ill ask around  but until then you need to come clean with this girl  and tell her the truth about yourself  what that im a penniless waiter who shares an apartment  with three other penniless waiters  and two penniless cabbies  were on a crosstown bus and you live with a cabbie  look im just saying if this woman doesnt care about you  for who you really are then shes not the right one  but i dont want to lose her mike  if she doesnt know who you are  you dont really have her in the first place  i just get so lonely  when you met molly it filled me with hope  but when carl got a girlfriend i wanted to hang myself  well with me and molly it was destiny  in carls case just pure dumb luck  like a chicken predicting the super bowl point spread  so you think if i tell amira the truth about myself  i could have what you have  sure hope so  i mean look at me  i dont know where my car is im riding on this stinky bus  an hour late for my own party  but because i know mollys sitting there waiting for me  its still the best birthday of my life  thats beautiful  im going to tell amira the truth right now  can you wait until after my party  cause i only get one like every 25 years  of course  happy birthday  are we done here  yeah were done  both moaning  sorry im late mom  molly what are you doing here  and what are all these decorations  dont bother what do you mean  the jig is up  we waited two hours  and everybody left and went to ihop  which is where we should have gone in the first place  let it go old woman  its always your way or the highway isnt it duchess  get off my back  stop fighting its my birthday  all surprise  screams  so i do get a party  we are having a party this is it right  we got him  got him good laughs  sighs  make a wish  i dont need to  i already got everything i want  all happy birthday to you  isnt that sweet  true love  yes  samuel i want a house  and so it shall be
