                i mean i understand that the woman is new to the school  and everybodys bending over backwards  trying to make her feel welcome but teacher of the month  please  thats an outrage  and it has nothing to do with the fact  that i was teacher of the month for the last six months  you know two more and i would have gotten  to keep the ceramic owl  i did not know that  not that im bragging you know  just a deserved recognition for being a good teacher  i didnt get it for wearing a pushup bra  and giggling like an idiot  every time some man makes a funny  chuckles  that reminds me  did you hear the joke about the blind prostitute  mike im telling you about my day  punch line is you gotta hand it to her laughs  you know cause shes blind yeah  vince i tell you joyce  im really starting to get the hang of this yoga malarkey  if i get any more limber i wont need you anymore  hey cowboy  if you can do it do it  that cuts my workload in half  shes got you doing yoga  yeah she wants to show me off at her high school reunion  thats why shes got me twisting in knots  and sniffing my own buttocks  i cant wait to glide into that sheraton banquet hall  with this hunk of italian sausage on my arm  you know when you describe me as a piece of meat  it makes me feel like a piece of meat  anyway if you ask me i think  little miss teacher of the month  is in for a rude awakening  and were back  shes gonna shes gonna find  that your field trips and learning games  and you know trying to be best friends with the kids  is not the a substitute for actual teaching  i mean she lets the kids call her by her first name  there is a balance between being loving and being firm  i dont think miss jennifer gets that  for the first time in my life   i see love   its just insane the way people are fawning all over her  oh did i tell you about  the great parking spot they gave her  you did i was appalled  oh look escape from the planet of the apes is on  i think thats the one where the monkeys go back in time  and wear suits and get jobs  mike  that parking thing is a travesty  right  and meanwhile im parking behind the cafeteria  under a tree filled with birds  who apparently eat nothing but lasagna and chocolate milk  my glutes are still vibrating from that yoga class  you could shake up a martini in my crack  hey i just got a batch of cuban cigars  and i thought you might want to partake  that sounds great  mike werewere in the middle of a conversation  its just the middle  id love to vince  but uh my girlfriend is sharing her day with me  actually were sharing our days  with each other  yeah right that  well have you gotten to the part  where you pass on an 80 cigar  because you were pretending to listen to your girlfriend  hey im not pretending  i listen to every word she says  i could tell you for a fact that today for lunch  molly had lasagna and chocolate milk  go smoke  nothing like the taste of a fine havana cigar  smuggled through the negligent borders of our canadian cousins  lucky for the both of us were burning the evidence  where the commies fall short is tennis shoes and electronics  never ever buy a cuban iphone  or a pair of air castros  good to know  listen  i wanted to talk to you about something  kind of a personal matter  oh boy everybodys in a chatty mood tonight  what im about to tell you is strictly hushhush  cause if joyce ever found out it would kill her  thank you for the cigar and the pleasant conversation  but i dont want to hear about another woman  whoa whoa whoa  this aint about me getting some on the side geez  i got to pop oysters and stiffy pills  just to keep up with the big red machine in there  good  cause i really want to finish that cigar  come on sit down  take a considerable load off  okay here it is  all this talk about joyces high school reunion  has made me feel bad  about not being a high school graduate  is that it  yeah whatd you think  i was gonna profess my love to you  no its just that  not graduating from high school isnt that big a deal  it is to me  and ive never told that to another living soul  youre kidding well  i was gonna confide it to my wife on her death bed  but we had so many other important things to talk about  of course  code to the alarm system  her recipe for manicotti  what dry cleaners my good black suit was at  well if youre worried about what joyce will think  im sure shell understand  joyce must never know  i dont want her to find out  my worldly sophisticated exterior  is nothing but a facade  you know technically the exterior is the facade  i think its french or something  see that right there is why i dont tell people  youre already talking to me like im an idiot  no im just saying you shouldnt feel bad  about not graduating high school  easy for you to say youre a learned man  well i wouldnt say learned  but i had a strong c average in high school  which made the transition to junior college a smooth path  hang on youre telling me you went to college  two full years and a mandatory summer session  that was eighth grade for me  geometry made me its bitch  ell why dont you just get your ged  thats what i wanted to talk to you about  youre a government employee  maybe you could pull a couple of strings  and slide me one under the table  doesnt really work that way  this isnt something i can just fix like a parking ticket  you told me you couldnt fix parking tickets i cant  then why are you dangling the carrot  look if you want to get your ged  you got to take the test but lucky for you  theres a woman in that house that can help you study  you mean molly  voted teacher of the mont six times in a row  she received the coveted ceramic owl  she doesnt really like me though  i mean i get that kids are always standoffish  when they know youre banging their mom  but she goes the extra mile  yeah she has yet to succumb to your unique charms  plus women tell each other everything  and shell end up blabbing it to joyce  cant argue with you there  that family could talk underwater  hey maybe you could get a tutor  how bout you  i dont know i was always  kind of a wing and a prayer kind of student  they used to call me mr cliff notes  but what about junior college  thats really just a high school where you can smoke  my point exactly  if a load like you can get kicked through the system  theres still hope for me  well thats not flattering  but i can certainly see what got you there  door opens mike sighs  a shower was a good idea  i am fresh as a daisy  unfortunately now your loofah smells like cigar smoke and bo  sexy  did you and vince have a good time tonight  it was okay hes a decent enough guy  see thats where you and i part ways  what did he want to talk to you about  nothing in particular  just cigar talk  cigar talk you know  this is a good cigar  glad you like it i like it a lot  hey is that a cat  no its a possum cigar talk  well i guess thats more fun  than having a conversation with your girlfriend  only because of the cigars and the possum sighting  may i offer you some squeakyclean loving  hang on hang on  so vince just wanted to give you an 80 cigar  and didnt want anything in return  same guy that offered you a box of steaks  in exchange for a handicap parking pass  i felt bad about that  he already bought those nice aluminum crutches  but tonight he just wanted to share something in confidence  you know mantoman  doesnt have anything to do with my mom does it  not really i mean other than the fact  he doesnt want her to know about it  wait a minute are you telling me  that hes keeping something from her  just because hes deeply ashamed  okay so if thats a no on the sex  i will bid you good night  what can i do a man tells me a secret  i got to take it to the grave  of course  so vince moranto didnt graduate high school  and you can understand why i couldnt tell molly that right  absolutely  its a personal private matter  and we all know women are notorious blabbermouths  i hate to say it  but it is kind of true isnt it  i tell my grandma one secret and the next thing you know  everybody in church is peeking around to see  if im really going commando underneath my choir robe  you actually do that  if they spent the money on airconditioning  instead of that stupid youth bus  i wouldnt have to be swinging low  while im singing sweet chariot  hey what are you guys talking about  mollys moms boyfriend told mike something in confidence  and now mollys upset because mike didnt tell her what it is  oh women love the gossip dont they  in senegal i once dated two sisters at the same time  and it was less than a week  before they blabbed it to each other  then on top of that they tried to make me the bad guy  so what is the big secret  vince didnt graduate high school  interesting  you know henry the cook is a dropout too  but you didnt hear it from me  so i was looking through one of the study guides  and they say the best way to start  is by taking a sample test  whoa whoa whoa right to it  no foreplay  you dont want to dance or rub zippers  look this is just a way to find out where your weak areas are  and what we need to concentrate on  i can tell you what my weak areas are  processing dairy and taking tests  and they both turn my bowels into an ass cannon  vince relax  and remember most of this stuff is just common sense  so take your time and do your best  all right  which of the following political actions  violated the principles of unalienable rights of liberty  that evolved from the us declaration of independence  is this for high school  or to become president of the united states  come on just think it through  and break it down i told you  i dont break things down well  and i had a milk shake for lunch  all right lets just move on to the next question  fine  which three of the original 13 colonies  for crying out loud  i dont know if this is math or history  im not really sure where theyre headed either  just forget it  im not good at tests  i never been good at tests  i get nervous i cant focus i get fidgety  add  hey i can add  i just dont like tests  bathroom break  vince we just got started  wasnt really a question  this one right here  was prom queen junior and senior year  shes a cute little filly  now shes a beerhauling clydesdale  well that prom queen is going to be green with envy  when she sees you walking in  with your yoga booty and your sexy man on your arm  oh yeah  shell be snorting and stomping her hoof  i better bring some carrots and sugar cubes  ooh something smells good in here  im trying a new brownie recipe  the secret is lessg smells brownie more potere  dont burn it like the last batch  i was secondhand high for a week  so wheres vince tonight  mm he said he had to work late but hes coming over later  ooh that reminds me  i gotta wax the wigglies  hey is uh everything okay with you two  sure  you didnt notice anything odd about his behavior  well hes been a little cranky lately  but hes probably just annoyed at me  for pushing him to lose weight grow hair  and have his neck wattle taped back  why do you ask  oh no reason  youre my mom i love you  just want to make sure youre happy  oh well thank you baby  oh  i am  good  chuckles  working late  that dirtbags not even a good liar  whats going on  i dont know for sure  but i know that he and mike  had a little secret man talk last night  and mikes being very cagey about it  you dont think vince is  doing anything behind moms back do you  see thats where my mind went too  oh my god hes cheating on her isnt he  you did not hear that from me  how long is it going to take you to grade this thing  hang on a second  add the combined scores of sentence structure  and usage

remarkably bad in fact  well how else am i going to get a ged  abraham lincoln never graduated high school  he did pretty well f himself  yeah except for getting shot in the head  to be fair a high school diplomas  not going to stop a bullet  so youre saying i just got to live with my secret shame  everybodys got one  ill share mine with you it makes you feel better  food  maybe  the point is the more you try to hide it  the worse its going to feel  why dont you just go to joyce  and tell her the truth i dont know  youll feel a lot better and the woman loves you  shes not going to judge you over something like that  would you mind going with me to tell her  you know for moral support  id be happy to  all right  boy i hope shes going to be okay  when she finds out her erudite prince is just a wellhung frog  erudite i cant believe  you didnt score higher on the verbal  listen when i get in there i may embellish my reasons  for dropping out of school a little bit  papa got sick i had to work the fields  care for the other younguns  something in that vein  for another cigar  ill tell her you were a coal miners daughter  what is going on here mike  i gotta talk to your mom  he

education  or a high school diploma but i got a heart  and you stuck a knife in it by way of my back  i know ii made a terrible mistake  let me make it up to you  how a kick in the groin  no thank you  hey moranto  what  i think you owe me an apology too  i mean you have an actual teacher right here  and you asked mike to tutor you  i regret that deeply  the only thing i learned from that guy  is that the chicago police department  is not a very picky organization  come on  give me a chance  why you want to help me  well its why i became a teacher  and seeing as that youre my moms fianc  i kind of makes you family  family  kind of  damn it  youre a tough nut to crack  but i love you snowball i really do  okay okay  oh vince im so sorry i doubted you  we just didnt know what to think

the ged exam  entire sentence missing  to go out and achieve academic excellence  well i guess we know why you hold the record  for teacher of the month chuckles  every student is different  you have to figure out what their individual needs are  now for vince  i just had to give him the proper tools  to overcome his fear of taking tests  oh man  do you guys know what happened  to the two pot brownies i was saving  quietly dont you want somebody to love   dont you need somebody to love   done
