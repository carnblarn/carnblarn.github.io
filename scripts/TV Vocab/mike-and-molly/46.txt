                       out of my dads ass  which reminds me  we have to call the caterer and have them switch  from steak knives to butter knives  why not play it safe and go all plastic  nah my mom can make a shiv out of anything  we should just serve soup and tear your own bread  and cold soup something that wont blister a face  just so you know whatever you guys need  christina and i are there for you right baby  of course  the biggest mistake my exhusband and i made  was letting ourselves get caught up  in everybody elses crazy  well this is my wedding  and that means nobody else gets to be crazier than me  el loco grande  si seorita  muy muy loco  by the way did you decide  where youre sleeping tomorrow night  shes testing me  right by your side baby  no youre not  its the night before the wedding  you have to stay somewhere else  why  because its tradition  one night apart before were joined together  you know for the rest of our lives  plus at the crack of dawn  that house is gonna be filled  with nervous women drinking mimosas  primping plucking and snapping  at each other  carl im staying at your house tomorrow night  well thats fine with me  but my grandma has her christian senior domino club over  and thats not the place to be if youre trying to avoid  spiteful women with a snoot full  why dont you stay with your mom  maybe the same reason  i dont chew on tin foil or try to kiss bears  come on itd mean a lot to her  to have her little boy there  on his last night of being an unmarried man  boy you really want me  to run screaming down that aisle dont you  a sense of urgency would be nice  anything for you my bride  i love you  i love you too  isnt that beautiful  yes it is  i love you christina  aww  thats sweet  for the first time in my life   i see love    sweetie if theres anything else  you need me to do just ask  okay talk to you later  you too  i cant  yes he is  all right  love you too  no i dont think he heard  molly says hi  uhhuh  i cant believe  christina left me hanging like that  what are you talking about  you know exactly what im talking about  i told that woman i loved her  laid my heart out in front of her  and she chopped it up like we were at benihanas  well maybe she didnt hear you  please the whole restaurant heard me  the busboy gave me a hug on the way out  you put her on the spot  and even if she did feel that way  she was probably too embarrassed to say it  i wasnt too embarrassed to say it  until she didnt say it back  then i wanted to roll up the tablecloth  and hang myself from a chandelier  you certainly covered it well by telling the waiter  all of his dessert selections were stupid  hey she didnt have to come out and say the actual words  id have been fine with a me too or a ditto  or a ayeaye captain dreamboat  well if its any consolation  i love you  see how it feels  so this is what you meant by your good black suit  its 100 angus  this baby retailed for two grand  i got it for 300 smackers and a crate of canadian tylenol  you think its a good idea  for a man who sweats the way you do  to be wrapped in a sausage casing  ill be fine  i took a leather punch and ventilated the crotch  is that the suit youre planning on walking me down the aisle in  what do you think  i think you need to give it back to the cow  and apologize  well they didnt actually live long enough  to be considered cows  technically its a veal suit  mom i did this as a favor for you  but im not walking down the aisle  with a guy dressed like a gay hit man  vince youre gonna have to find something else  when am i gonna get a chance to wear this  well bury you in it  we can do it now if you want  why you driving yourself so crazy  the only thing people remember about a wedding  is the dried chicken  and which bridesmaid got drunk and flashed her cans  that reminds me make sure victoria wears a bra  ill do my best  but its like keeping a hat on a dog  you better get used to this  you know were gonna go through the same thing  when we get hitched  what are you talking about  you said you didnt want a big wedding  well my first one was with a justice of the peace  and now im thinking id like a nice church ceremony  hey let those kids blow their money on wedding crap  for geezers like us  id rather save it for something practical  like new hips or an rv  he is gonna need a hip replacement soon  oh so much of him needs to be replaced  this is gorgeous andre  i look like a portly james bond  doublex seven  yeah normally i look pretty hideous  in formal wear  but purr kitty purr  well here at andres big and tall  everybody walks out with a smile  and not just because of the free tootsie roll  we hide in every pocket  cool  excellent  hey im telling you  i didnt even bring it up with christina in the car  and when she tried to engage  i just gave her short oneword answers  i see so you were pouting like little baby bitch  no i was maintaining my dignity like a man  who was pouting like a little baby bitch  see i open up to you and all you do is make jokes  i love you carl  shut up  well looks like were gonna have to find  something for you fellas in our boys department  youre probably a husky medium  and im guessing youre a tall small  kind of a bummer  not being able to find clothes that fit huh  whos the freak now  take it easy harry  they are visitors to our plussized planet  sorry  i got a little full of myself  but seriously  im sweet syrup in an aunt jemima bottle  carl you need to let this whole christina thing go  at least until after we get through the wedding  hey im not gonna bring it up at all  in fact im gonna ice her completely out  and flirt with mollys sister  no youre not  i got enough to worry about trying to keep my mom and dad  from

flowers  thanks for doing that  youre a good maid of honor  which reminds me  got a little something for you  what  i was gonna give it to you tomorrow  but i thought you might need a little cheering

walking with you down the aisle  im so happy youre my sister  me too  will you please wear a bra tomorrow  listen it was a long time ago and i got swept up  in the whole maydecember romance  who knew

powdered wig  vince  would you take 3000 eight  five and you can kick him in the nuts again deal  get out your checkbook and take a deep breath  let me change shoes  okay  oh what are you doing here
