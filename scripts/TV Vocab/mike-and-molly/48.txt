apart  yeah he gets a little lost without me  its understandable i am kind of his hero  sure  man that was some impressive police work back there  the way you apprehended that perp  it couldve gotten real ugly  well the boy was sorry  and he did give the silly putty back to the cashier  you showed a lot of restraint  me a butthole  youre gonna see it on the 600 news  just doing my job  youre too modest  you are without a doubt the finest police officer  ive ever had the pleasure of working with  well im sure your partners no slouch  he aint nothing but a slouch  gone for two weeks and not one word  i even put a prepaid phone card inside a hershey bar  so i know he found it  well you got to cut him a little slack it is his honeymoon  which he wouldnt be on if it wasnt for me  i was the cupid that made that relationship happen  and it took about a dozen arrows  like taking down mobydick with thumbtacks  the guy in that saturns driving a little erratically  im gonna run his plates  listen to you  youre gonna run his plates  you are the real deal officer  damn fine cop  youd call me from your honeymoon wouldnt you  excuse me excuse me  could i have some more warm nuts  absolutely

in his complimentary jammies  can you believe it one size really does fit all  boy i hate leaving france  oh me too  quaint little shops the architecture  the museums  and how about the bidet right  i mean the best invention ever  its so much more civilized  i dont know how im ever gonna go back to using toilet paper  well just for the record you are  oh yeah yeah im just saying  its the difference between a babbling brook and a pinecone  true  i mean theres a reason you soak the plates before you wipe em  all right  good talk  wow the honeymoon is really over  it was like a dream  now its back to the old grind  well im not looking forward to going back either  mom and victoria without adult supervision for two weeks  im guessing the whole house is empty wine bottles  floating in bong water  and cats  i dont know why but i just keep picturing a ton of stray cats  victoria sweetie breakfast is ready  coming mommy  oh dont you look pretty  not too slutty for work is it  molly says it makes my breasts look like  two pumpkins rolling off a porch  she says the same thing about my thong underwear  every time i go out to pick up the newspaper  where are the coffee cups  one shelf up  i moved the wineglasses  down to eye level  molly tries to put them out of my reach  she forgot i took that rock climbing class  morning ladies  morning morning  boy i just had the best shower  without mike in the house you dont have to worry  about getting scalded from his 700 am double flush  i just like being able to walk in the bathroom  without a gas mask and a canary  and would you look at this leftover cheesecake  has anyone living in this house ever uttered those words  god how many times have i come down here  to find mike in the dark standing at the fridge  like a raccoon caught digging in the trash can  up on his hind legs chicken bone in his mouth  with those two little red eyes glaring at you  i mean i love them both  but its kind of been a honeymoon for all of us  hey why dont we celebrate our last day of freedom  with a nice pitcher of mimosas  why not im guessing its sunday somewhere  now thats convenient  right thank you  mmm  oh  sweetie  are you still awake  you need to get some sleep  look at that map  thats our plane  in four inches well be back in chicago  you know were gonna take other trips  once you know we pay off this one  and and buy a house  and pay off my student loans  your what nothing  i dont know why we have to go back  i mean whats stopping us from hopping on another plane  and going anywhere we want  well im out of frequent flyer miles  and you cant buy plane tickets with cheese  we dont need money  youre a teacher im a cop  we can do that anywhere  we can barely do it in chicago  just go to sleep  ive been sleeping my whole life  paris was like a splash of cold water  oh god is this about that bidet again  fine we can get one  but good luck getting my mom off that thing  this isnt about stuff its about living our lives  for the moment and following our hearts  what has gotten into you i had to practically drag you to paris  and now you want to roam the earth like kung fu  im just saying  theres got to be more to life than going to work  and coming home and watching tv  so it sounds like youre finally open  for some new experiences  i am  you know we could take that watercolor class or  or we could learn to salsa dance  or we could get season tickets at the opera  you really ought to get some sleep  mission accomplished  well mike will be home tomorrow  so im guessing youll stop moping around  like eeyore without his pooh  im not moping im hurt  i called him every day when i was at space camp  im sure theres a very good reason he hasnt called you  you know what im moving on  at least now im riding with genuine police  and not having to pull over into a park  so mike can take a nap on the picnic table  lets roll  see that  fly zipped up and not a drop of mustard on his badge  and clean hands  and no toilet paper stuck to his shoe  im telling you hes a class act  actually waited to get out of the car before he cut a fart  yeah quite a change from mike rolling up all the windows  and shouting live in it man live in it  so so then the guy says oh it must be your feet then  oh youre terrible  im filthy im an animal  another round of hooch ladies  i dont know that that last mimosa tasted a little weird  we ran out of oj and champagne  so i substituted tang and tequila  i call it a mexican on the moon  hey were not out of champagne  i bought mike and molly a real nice bottle  for a wedding present  we cant  molly made us promise not to unwrap anything  while she was gone  well  until she opens that gift it still belongs to you  you sure about this  as sure as a guy drunk on tang and tequila can be  thats all i need to hear  wait so so youre saying the kama sutra love kit  is technically still ours  can you believe they left that here  i told em theyd want that on their honeymoon  but in one ear and out the other  i think thats one of the positions  bucket list number 83  invent ice creamfilled mms  number 84 invent pocket refrigerator  honey have you been awake all night  yes i have  im writing my bucket list  may i  you may  eat gelato in a roman piazza  eat peking duck near the great wall  go to germany and eat wiener schnitzel  you know you can knock most of these out  at the mall food court  oh hey hey  you should climb mount everest  because i hear theyve got snow cones up there  having someone mock my bucket list  is not on my bucket list  now if youll excuse me ive had 11 cups of coffee  and the only thing holding it in is my seat belt  he just came from france and he cant spell mnage  trois  woof  first class or coach they all smell like crap  whoa whoa  ladies and gentlemen we seem to have hit a bit of rough air  so please remain seated with your seat belt fastened  i cant die alone in the can  no belt theres no belt  i want to go home  no more travel no more bucket list  molly  molly  you sure you dont want to go grab a beer  and hang out a little bit  im ready to call it a day  its been a real pleasure riding with you carl  the pleasure was all mine sir  you are truly one of the finest police officers ive ever known  appreciate you saying that  your partners a lucky man  yeah tell him that  oh by the way i got you a little something  you bought me a gift  nothing extravagant  i just noticed when we were walking the beat  that you overpronate on your right foot  so you got me an insert  yeah thatll even out your gait  maybe relieve some of that lower back pain  thats always troubling you  carl i dont know what to say  i hope that mike appreciates  working alongside you as much as i did  nah he doesnt appreciate me at all  not a word in two weeks  and tomorrow hes just going to waltz back into my life  like nothings wrong  well im just glad you and i had this time together  thank you  all right  you be careful out there  if youd like to stay in touch im on facebook  my profile pic is jude law  home sweet home huh  its actually not as bad as i thought it would be  you called it  you know its funny i almost said squirrels  you know paris was okay but they dont have anything  we cant get right here in chicago illinois  hmm ive heard that  except for the cheese  thats a war with france we lose  hey thanks for that cool blanket again man  very thoughtful  im gonna keep it in the plastic so it stays nice  just a little token to show how much i missed you  and that i was thinking about you  well it was a lovely surprise  but you know i did not expect anything  thats why i did it  so how were your two weeks with your temporary partner  you guys get along  why what did you hear  nothing  oh yeah he was all right  little clingy  but i think he benefited from being around real police  ah lucky for him he had a guy like you to show him the ropes  well what good is wisdom unless you can share it with others  im glad it worked out  and im glad you had a nice honeymoon  dont you ever leave me again i wont i swear to god i wont
