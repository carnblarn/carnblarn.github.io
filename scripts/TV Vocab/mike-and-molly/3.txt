 do you uh always check out my behind when im bent over  well i try to look every other way  but that thing is an imax  well regardless i feel better i got more energy  i dont know if youre aware of this  but for a long time i struggled with a midday lag  well if youre talking about that time between noon to 500  when i drive and you sleep  yeah ive noticed  well no more  and the great thing is im not dieting  i eat whatever i want  its all about portion control  well i been preaching moderation to you for years  the stomach understood  the ears werent ready to listen  morning gentlemen  hey samuel  ill have the french toast  with hash browns and a large orange juice  mm good choice  and for you big and bountiful  i will have a half a cup of grapenuts  two inches of bacon  and one silverdollar pancake with a teaspoon of syrup  is he making a joke  i usually find more food than that under his chair  afraid not  okay  uh would you like skim milk on your grapenuts  no whole milk just a whisper  i like my nuts crunchy  you are certain my chain is not being yanked  huh  you understand my suspicions though right  just go get my food  so what you got going on tonight  nothing really  i was thinking about asking molly out again  are you crazy  you cant ask a woman out on the same day  why not cause even if shes got nothing going on shes gonna tell you  shes got something going on so you dont think shes got  nothing going on when you call her and ask her whats going on  so should i call her or not  sure you got nothing going on  really what are you doing tonight  making fondue with your grandma  its chili night  you know i was thinking maybe id ask molly to go bowling  bowling  oh you dog  i see the tender trap youre baiting  what its just a second date  i figured it would be a fun nopressure kinda deal  uhhuh  and it has nothing to do with the fact that when it comes  to bowling youre a chunky white michael jordan  it does not  not to mention a sight to behold  in that pink and black shirt with the matching ball  you know i won that ball in a police league tournament  i built the ensemble around it  you smoothass casanova you  im not a casanova  i havent even kissed this girl yet  forget kissing  youre gonna be looking at a seventen split  that schoolteacher aint gonna know what hit her  when she sees you treat those pins  like your ten little bitches  well whether it goes that far or not  i just want to show her a good time  she lives at home with her mom and her sister  i get the feeling she doesnt have  a lot of excitement in her life  put the scissors down no no  im gonna cut it all off  no man is worth it  he said he loved me  hes married  he wont be after his wife gets my hair   for the first time in my life    i see love    well i finally got sweeney todd to bed  howd you manage that  i crushed up three xanax and put it in her teeth whitening tray  you know its all my fault shes so fragile  i was too hard on her growing up  too hard you breastfed her till she was five  phone rings i wouldve done the same for you  except you were eating corn on the cob before you had teeth  hello  hey mike  molly uh not much  hanging with mom and sis  tonight  you cant leave  watch me  um bowling yeah that sounds fun  your sister needs us now  hang on  mom shes doing this for attention  its the same reason shes got a webcam in her bathroom  fine  but if you come home and find the coroner  snapping a toe tag on your sister  promise me you wont blame yourself  deal  i love him  i must go to him  oh damn its awake  sure that sounds fun great   listen why dont i just bring you  a whole order of french fries  and you just eat 12 of them  if i could eat just 12  this shirt wouldnt look like it was made in an awning store  i tried that portion control diet once  yeah howd it go  gained 14 pounds  three frickin gummi bears at a time  actually im having wonderful success with it  and if i stay on track im thinking next summer  shirtless at the beach  ill bring the suntan lotion  just in case bring a bucket and a paint roller  that is quite an outfit  im guessing youve done this before  well im not gonna lie to you  im a bit of a legend in these parts  oh really  well maybe legends too strong  folk hero  im prepared to be impressed  me i just did a little bowling in college  mostly as an excuse to drink  yeah you know a lot of people like  to mix alcohol with a sport  but i dont like my senses dulled  cant put beer goggles on the eye of the tiger  right you know if youre ever interested in a couple of tips  id be happy to help thatd be great  all right  first off theres a lot of misconceptions about bowling  its not just about brute force  its about form followthrough and finesse  the three fs i like to call em  not to be confused with the three rs  reading writing and rithmatic which is your forte  now the key to form  is keeping your wrist straight okay  key to a followthrough  is releasing the ball in a smooth gliding motion  luther attaboy mike  ignore him  what about finesse  forget finesse for now focus on fun  okay  hope i dont embarrass myself  hey were just here to have a good time  nobodys gonna be embarrassed  oh look i knocked them all down  ill be darned  was my form okay  yeah i mean uh  youre still bending your wrist quite a bit  but that goes away with practice  could i take another turn  sure  maybe ill get lucky again  thats a very healthy attitude  booyah thats what im talking about  thats good thats real good  wheres my 12 french fries  seriously though i dont feel right about taking your money  no no i made the bet  and you won fair and square  under his breath sandbagger  what  nothing  hey samuel  this is molly molly samuel  oh pleased to meet you samuel  the pleasure is mine  i heard the large man was seeing someone  but i of course assumed you were imaginary  thats funny  samuels from africa  he came here to pursue the american dream  and apparently to bust my balls  what part of africa are you from  i grew up in senegal but my mothers from france  do you speak french  fluently  i also speak arabic wolof and a little german  apparently the only language he doesnt speak is waiter  i speak a little german too  uh was ist los mit der hund   nicht viel nur chillen  laughing  i asked him what up dawg  and he said not much just chillin  thats good  you working tonight or just doing a floor show  im sorry  he gets grumpy when he doesnt get his tiny pancake  so what are you doing here in the united states  im studying english literature at the university of illinois  oh i love english lit  its where i fell in love with shakespeare  ah shakespeare  love looks not with the eyes but with the mind  and therefore is winged cupid painted blind  in unison nor hath loves mind of any judgment taste  wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste  cheering  ah screw it  whatevers on the grill im eating  big man gets bitchy when hes hungry  keep a snickers bar in your purse  sowhats next  you want to grab a drink somewhere  i dont think so  you sure you dont have to worry about  blurring the eye of the tiger anymore  yep  hey we could just drive around a little  its a really beautiful night  well youre a schoolteacher  you see the beauty i see the crime  the corruption and the danger  so what do you thinks more dangerous  the coffee bean and tea leaf or the gymboree  thats funny  you should just go right here on wells  its a quicker way to get to my house  scuse me im a chicago police officer  i know these streets like the back of my hand  okay sorry  i may not know how to quote shakespeare  but i know i can navigate the city of the broad shoulders  carl sandburg  great illinois poet  i know i love his poems  its actually city of the big shoulders  broad is fine i mean you get it  look mike if ive done anything to upset you  night  thanks  i had a nice time i guess youll call me right  car engine starts okay  you bowl like a girl  i cant live without him  im getting too old for this crap  you and me both  or cinemax in my bedroom  knock on door  turns off tv  what are you doing here  oh no  come here  what happened  it was a complete disaster  erectile dysfunction  no i didnt even kiss her good night  so the penis is fine  as far as i know  hes been hiding for the last couple hours  did you tie your shoes and give her the rear view  cause i may have fudged its attractiveness  out of friendship  grandma carlton who was at the door  its just mike grandma  go back to bed  oh hey michael  how are you baby  im all right nana  how are you  oh im right with my savior and tight with my bookie  what are you doing here sugar  carlton told me you had a date  uh i did but it ended pretty early  erectile dysfunction  cause carlton got some pills if you need them  uh grandma how many times  have i asked you to stay out of my room  well when you start doing your own laundry  i will stay out of your room  until then i go where i please  pays 200 a month in rent and he gonna start  telling me where i can and cannot go  now michael what happened with this girl  i dont know we just didnt make a connection  i see  you didnt make a connection  yeah you know our world views dont jibe  your world views dont jibe  exactly  now michael id like to see you in heaven too  but lying to an old lady aint gonna get you there  she beat me at bowling  youre kidding me  and i dont mean just beat me  i mean she covered my ass in pledge  and wiped the floor with it  the bowling alleys your home court advantage  only place you got left to shine is house of pies  hush up black gilligan  continue michael  its not just that  she was showing off and speaking in different languages  you mean in tongues like the pentecostals  no like french and german and shakespeare  oh good  cause i been to a tent revival  and that mess will put you off jesus  so if i hear you correctly  whats upsetting you is you had a date with  a smart capable young woman and it threatened your masculinity  no clears throat  deep voice no  oh michael  why is it you boys get so intimidated by strong women  want us all to just be dumb and grateful  no i dont want dumb  i am a fan of grateful  please whens the last time you laid your eyes on grateful  let me tell you something michael  you got to embrace the beauty  of a strong independent woman  if it was me id cut my losses and move on  i guess we know why youre in the bathroom alone  on a friday night shaving your head with my lady schick  and i pray to god thats all you were shaving  now michael do you have feelings for this girl  yeah i guess i do  well then you need to stop behaving like a petulant child  go back to her tell her whats in your heart  and how you really feel  ugh really  take it from me  you show her that side of you  and she will open up like a flower  cause there aint nothing sexier in the world  than a secure man being honest with his woman  man in distance baby you coming back to bed  now that man  is honest as the day is long  and had he not been honest i never wouldve  found out he was long  god i love your grandma  you may not believe this now  but youll get over this man  yes you will  and youll find somebody else  somebody sweet and kind and loving  and single  id try single for the next one  you know just to shake things
