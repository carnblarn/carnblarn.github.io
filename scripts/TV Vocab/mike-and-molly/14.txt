what is it with you  were you not breast fed as a child  hey vin  im gonna go up and run a hot bath and light a few candles  if you care to join me  you kiddin  between the viagra the belly dancer  and watchin you eat with your fingers  i got enough lumber to build a coffee table  meet you upstairs  go ahead and start the engine  ill be up in a minute to back it out of the driveway  what does that even mean  hey mikey if youre interested  i got a couple extra bull tickets  for tomorrow nights game  against boston i thought that game was sold out  my moroccan pal gave me his season tickets  a little payback for getting him a deal on rat traps  the quiet kind so they dont freak out the customers  oh man bullsceltics im in  mike i thought you and i had plans for tomorrow night  we can go to a stupid movie anytime  were talking about the bulls and the celtics  third row behind home bench  and i rented a limo  oh my god third row behind home bench  and he rented a limo  just consider it a thankyou for keeping the streets safe  from all the perverts and scumbags  now if youll excuse me  im gonna go throw her mom one in the bathtub  where do you keep your gun is at home or in the car  can you believe this third row  youre actually going  well theres two tickets we can both go  no im not taking anything from that man  hes just trying to worm his way into my family  and what a great way to do it  third row bulls tickets  welcome to the family vince moranto  all right if you feel comfortable  taking what is clearly a bribe  then by all means have a good time  im a cop  people give me free stuff all the time  and i dont do squat in return  thats what would make it a bribe  im not going  but if you want to go thats up to you  you know what fine  i wont go  really  sure what the hell  its just a basketball game  and i promised id take you to dinner and a movie  thank you i really appreciate that  aw come on you gonna hold me to that  ah what are you reading  book  the sisterhood of the traveling pants  yes  wow youre already halfway through it  i started in the middle  a good book can grab you anywhere  mike i know youre upset with me  what makes you think that  because youre pretending to read  hey i can read  i cant believe because you dont like vince  i dont get to have any fun  look i just dont trust the guy  and im guessing the minute he gets what he wants from my mom  hes out of here  oh and you really think your moms  been holding something back  boy thats not what im hearin through the walls  mike listen to me  im not telling you you cant go to that game  youre not  no that has to be your decision  so whichever way i go youll be okay with that  thats my decision  youre killing me  samuel let me ask you a question  we come in here all the time right  if we covered you in vinyl we could use you as a booth  and once in a while  youve been known to give us the occasional free meal  and dessert coffee to go  curbside service for when youre too lazy  to button your pants and come inside  right right  and in exchange have we ever given you  any extra protection or surveillance whatsoever  ive never even heard a thankyou  i rest my case  i believe once we were even robbed  while you were sitting here eating your free oatmeal  you see nobody can bribe mike biggs  she doesnt like the guy so i dont get to go to the game  crazy right  yeah its crazy  but your problem is youre trying to approach this thing  using logic and common sense  and that aint the way women work  so when she told me she didnt care if i went to the game  she meant if you do go to that game dont bother coming home  its like when you offer me a bite of your dilly bar  i know you dont mean it  and i know you dont want me to have it  thats true i dont  look in relationships its all about solidarity  you gotta like who she likes and hate who she hates  even if it makes absolutely no sense at all  especially when it makes no sense  thats when her convictions are the strongest  i thought relationships were supposed to be  about give and take  they are she gives you sex  and you take whatever crazy bs she throws at you  i guess the bottom line is  i wont be sitting third row at tonights bulls game  third row oh man that must hurt like a bitch  but still you gotta back your lady no matter what  i cant believe this  im passing up two tickets to a bullsceltics game  two tickets  course there is another way to look at this thing  boy that was a terrific dinner honey  glad you enjoyed it  now you wont have to fill up on hot dogs at the game  always looking out for your man huh  every waking minute  sarcasm thatthatthats never good  golly you shouldve seen carls face  when he found out we were going to the bulls game  it just lit up  i bet it did  see for me thats the whole joy of going to this thing  you know seeing how happy it makes carl  uhhuh  well i hope you guys have fun tonight  molly please  i cant enjoy myself if i know youre upset  well thats a shame  you know what forget it  im gonna tell those guys to go on without me  if thats what you want to do  its not what i want to do  i want to go to the game  and i want you to say its okay  so i can get drunk have a good time  and not worry about coming home to that face right there  mike come on lets go  have fun  stop saying that  boy you got a mean streak in you sister  mikey you sure i cant mix you  a refreshing alcoholic concoction  man makes a wicked lemon drop  he even sugared the rim  aw i better not  if molly smells liquor on my breath  shell think i had a good time  hey you gotta snap out of it  youre already in the doghouse  you might as well pee on the carpet  come on have a little hooch  some of the best sex ive ever had involved liquor and anger  i agree if she aint mad at you you aint doin it right  i guess one beer wouldnt hurt  attaboy  oh and after the game  i was thinkin we could pop into the locker room  and say hi to some of the players  youre kiddin  we get to meet the team  yeah one of the trainers  used to bang my cousin so that kinda makes him family  did you hear that  we are gonna be in the locker room with  our chicago bulls

smoke a lot of pot back then mom  mm  you know when i was pregnant i couldnt drink  and it really did help with the morning sickness  well a lot has changed since then  its all scientific now  weed advancement really took off once the nerds got involved  well hats off to those little foureyed virgins  now if we can just get em working on  wrinkle cream and hair removal  absolutely  todays pubic hair technology  really leaves much to be desired  oh yeah were losing that race to the brazilians  oh good  secondhand pot smoke and a table full of snacks  its an overeaters dream  do you want to watch the basketball game with us  no thank you  oh come on  vince said if they point the camera at him  hes gonna stand up and cup his junk as kind of a secret hello  great  please tell me hes gonna be our new daddy  honey i know youre not crazy about him  but hes really a very sensitive and caring man  why because when he walks out of the bathroom  he announces the air quality  listen ive dated guys who didnt do that trust me  its better to know what youre walking into  is that mike  no thats the mascot  oh youre right  mike doesnt have a tail does he  look mom i just think you can  you can do a lot better than that guy  come on molly  you never like any of my boyfriends  remember jerry the housepainter  you made him cry  i caught him stealing money from your purse  that man was a sexual dynamo  he earned every penny  and thanks to you our garage door is still only half yellow  mom im not trying to tell you how to live your life  its just that i love you and i dont want to see you get hurt  aw sweetie i appreciate you worrying about me  but im just having a good time with the man  besides im a big girl and i can take care of myself  youre right  its your life  if he makes you happy thats whats  thats whats important  from now on i am officially butting out  dont you dare  hey look mom  vince is saying hello  this was the greatest night of my life seriously  ill probably have to lie to people at some point  and say it was my wedding day or the birth of my first child  but the three of us will know the truth  double overtime bulls win by two  plus they scored over 100 points which means we all get  free chalupas  i mean it was a magical evening right  i dont know how to thank you vince  third row seats and we got to go  into the locker room after the game  boy some of those guys were swingin the sausage huh  not that i was lookin but they were at eye level  yeah i thought that one was gonna eat  a peanut out of my hand  you know dip down into the water bucket and wash his back  elephant trunk we got it at peanut  well im glad you boys had a good time  maybe mention to your girlfriend  that im not such a bad egg  oh she doesnt think youre a bad egg  she just thinks her moms  scraping the bottom of the barrel by dating you  but why i treat joyce like a queen  hey this isnt coming from me  its just that molly thinks your intentions  are less than honorable  look im not gonna lie to you ive loved many women  but joyce aint like them other skanks  shes smart shes funny  plus she can match me kink for kink in the boudoir  i probably wont tell molly about the kink part  she might not see it as the compliment you intended  well you know her better than i do  so where to now gents  the night is still young  i should probably head home  molly was pretty mad when i left  we cant go home now  were drunk were in a limo  hey lets cruise past a nightclub with the windows down  and tell everybody were earth wind  fire  youre kidding  d do you remember d  d
