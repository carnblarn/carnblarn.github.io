                   off a bathroom stall  at an overeaters anonymous meeting  you know its gonna be good  well i guess this is the awkward moment  portion of the evening  yep the looming question  who gets the leftovers  you want to come in for a while  uh are your mom and sister home  theyre probably asleep let me check  hey  did you guys do it yet  not asleep  but we can still hang out in my room  so wed have to walk right past the two of them right  well unless you own a jet pack  it just feels kind of unsavory  why were not doing anything wrong  thats true were just two grown people  out on a date that arent ready to say good night yet  exactly shall we  lets do it chuckles  both suggestively hey  shudders  okay how bout this  saturday night you come over to my place  that way we dont have to worry about the smurfs  and uh we can relax and do whatever we want to do  whatever we want to do huh  absolutely  why are you smiling  why are you smiling  im smiling cause i get the leftovers  come here you  for the first time in my life   i see love    so you got any plans for this weekend  i promised my grandma id clean out the garage  i thought you cleaned the garage last weekend  im kind of dragging my feet  im afraid once i get it done  shes gonna make me live out there  yeah like in the army  when the enemy makes you dig your own grave  exactly so what are you up to  ah not much  mollys coming over saturday night  you dirty dirty dog  all right  i told you hed get laid  before the cubs won a world series  now is your apartment ready for entertaining a lady  cause the last time i saw your bathtub  it looked like youd washed a gorilla in it  dont worry  im going after it with a grill brush and some degreaser  plus im buying a new shower curtain nice sheets  and some of that liquid soap that the ladies seem to favor  good idea  now you dont have to worry about plucking your pubes  out of the irish spring  oh that is tedious work  i live with five roommates  our soap looks like a wet cat  i also cleaned the oven  vacuumed all the skittles out of the couch cushions  and im buying drapes for the bedroom window  those drapes should have happened years ago  im surprised your neighbors didnt start a petition  what about candles or incense  way ahead of you i put an airwick on the toilet tank  mangokiwi  its like having a luau on your crapper  well thats fine for knocking back the funk  but candles also help create a mood  a sensual ambiance if you will  is that why i get aroused when i see a birthday cake  no no  but while were talking about food  youre gonna need a bottle of champagne and some strawberries  strawberries  bigass strawberries  i dont know why but it drives the ladies wild  youd think it would be bananas  yeah a banana and a couple of plums  laid out on the coffee table  mmhmm it should get their motor running  women are such mysterious creatures  beautiful unsolvable mysteries  like those big alien crop circles  but with nipples  all right strawberries candles champagne  anything else  um whipped cream you know in case  you want to freak it up a notch  im trying to stay away from sweets  then get fatfree  you dont have to blow your diet to get your kink on  but dont forget the four silk scarves  so she can tie you to the bed  and one large ostrich feather  to be used on the underside of your scrotum  youre not there yet  okay thats cool  dont forget to take a pair of clean underwear  so if you do spend the night youre prepared  but i dont want him to think  i was planning on spending the night  oh molly theres a lot of reasons a gal  keeps an extra pair of drawers in her purse  some good some bad let him decide  i cant believe how nervous i am  well then throw in another pair of panties  better safe than smelly  mom please youre not helping  oh honey relax its just sex  i know its been a while but its like riding a bike  you know if instead of wheels the bike had two balls  how long has it been honey  i dont know  four days five hours  wow youre lucky its not like pierced ears  where the holes grow shut  thatd be an embarrassing trip back to the mall  whoa you cant let this guy  see you wearing that big ol pair of granny panties  dont you have a thong  im not wearing a thong victoria  how bout a bustier  how about two bandaids and a cork  you know what  im just going to finish this up by myself  why dont you two go watch tv  or bat a dead mouse around the kitchen floor  no we want to help you  which reminds me have you trimmed the hedges  what are you talking about  well  you tend to get a little shaggy in your scoobydoo  im not having this conversation with you  mom  listen princess  you dont want him to get lost in the weeds  trying to find the pumpkin patch  have you ever heard the expression  does the carpet match the drapes  only when shopping for carpeting or drapes  well just so you know  practically nobody has carpeting anymore  just a tiny little area rug near the entry way  look i have no interest in pouring hot wax  on my lady business and ripping all the hair out  five hours sweetie  i can have that wax heated up lickety split  and then he can get at it lickety split  all right maybe a little off the sides  but we should probably have a safe word  well i always just scream ouch my hoohah  right this way  why you walking funny  i pulled a muscle at the gym  feeling the burn huh  you have no idea  exhales  here we are chez mike  after you my lady  thank you sir  the humble digs of an honest cop  very ni oh  very nice i love the hardwood floors  yeah when i first moved in it was walltowall shag  took two guys all day to yank that stuff up  they were tearing and pulling  i get it i get it i get it  so how long have you lived here  i found this place a few years ago  its a funny story it was actually a crime scene  murdersuicide  gay couple been together since the 70s  hence the shag carpeting  anyway  i guess one of the fellas came home  from a sevenday carnival cruise  and found the other one in flagrante  with what was either a man or a woman  all we found was a bloody footprint  from a size 16 chacha heel  i guess that storys more tragic than it is funny  as murdersuicides tend to be  would you like a glass of champagne  not right now  yeah probably not a good idea  the bubbles make me a little gassy  how bout we just talk  sure talkings good  exhales  oh i forgot the strawberries  you want a strawberry  no thank you you sure  theyre the big ones size of your fist  like a bowl of big red baby heads  im fine for now  all right well  let me know if you change your mind  are you nervous at all  im a walking pit stain  me too its just been so long  since ive been alone with a man in his apartment  well if it makes you feel any better  the last time there was a woman in this apartment  she was a he and someone got bludgeoned to death  not exactly the comfort i was looking for  but nice to know  molly  yeah  promise

doors closing  mom are you okay  mikey you shouldnt have come  did you call an ambulance  no i dont want to bother anybody  its not bothering anybody  we need to get you to the hospital  what and pay

biggs  im sorry youre not feeling well  thank you dear  ah i see what it was  the shadow from your nose  makes it look like you have a mustache  raspy breathing  raspy breathing  mom please you need to see a doctor  no i dont trust doctors  they just want to saw you open or diddle with your innards  mrs biggs it wouldnt hurt to at least get checked out  oh ive lived through worse pain than this  mikey came out 14 pounds and sideways  im lucky i can keep any food inside me  can i offer you one of my famous sevenlayer cookies  no thank you  please cant we just go in for a few tests  just to be safe no  no tests no thumbs  thumbs what doctor is she seeing  i said leave it alone  mom you gotta stop giving that dog beer  thats not jim  jims are more bacony  well it wasnt me  hey mom  what  process of elimination  but if youre gonna blame the dog  ill go get my portable oxygen tank and take him for a walk  no no you sit ill take him  okay  remember not to rush him or squeeze him  or eyeball him when hes in the middle of one  i know the drill ma  ill be right back  hurry  so is this the house mike grew up in  yep  i wish i would have known him when he was a little boy  really and would you still be the same age you are now  what no  ii was just saying  it would have been fun to have seen him as a kid  riding his bike playing kickball  i get it you like em young  sighs  i love your house  sweet little place  very inviting  it was paradise for a while  then that ratbastard husband of mine  ran off with a twodollar whore  and left me with a mortgage i couldnt afford  and a 16yearold boy who ate cereal with a snow shovel  any more family history you want to dredge up  no that should hold me for a while  you know its weird mikeys never mentioned you before  im sure it just slipped his mind  why would he be ashamed of you  cookie  yeah ill have a cookie  hmm  and you said these were famous  do you want to just take me home  no no the nights still young  you sure you seem a little preoccupied  ill be fine  its just natural to worry about her  i get that  but she seems to be built from pretty tough lumber  youd think but after my dad left  shes been like a little lost bird  a crow  what  nothing  but didnt you tell me your dad ran off like 20 years ago  leaving the two of us alone  while he went off to florida with that hooker  can you imagine leaving my dear sweet mother  for a prostitute  can you  molly  no god no  mike yeah  i think thats enough  its starting to feel like midnight mass in here  oh okay  how are the strawberries  are they big enough  i guess  why dont you sit down and try and relax  right im sorry  im just a little distracted by my mom  im sure shes fine  i dont know sometimes she puts on a brave face  so i wont worry  well i think that face is just her face  but i think its really sweet  that you take such good care of her  well if i dont do it whos gonna do it  i get it  after your folks divorced you became the man of the house  thats probably why shes so uncomfortable  with the idea of you having another woman in your life  what do you mean  well dont you find it a little odd  that she started having chest pains  after she found out you were on a date  wait are you saying that my mom is trying to prevent me  from having a relationship  i dont know about that but im pretty sure  shes trying to prevent me from having one  hey i dont know how things work in your family  but in my family we take care of each other  we take care of each other too  we just dont fake heart attacks  to keep each other from getting laid  phone ringing  oh and there she is  shes probably just calling to say shes fine  phone ringing  well you have a decision to make  you can take that call and see if shes okay  or you can take me in your bedroom  mike recorded hi this is mike  i cant come to the phone right now  i think youre going to make the right decision  peggy hi mikey its mom  listen im fine but im really worried about jim  hes not eating his kibble  and when i call his name his response is very  i dont know ambivalent  mikey  mikey  hello  jim you talk to him  feels like the first time by foreigner playing  peggy mikey  you want some more eggs  no thanks  this is great  theyre not too dry are they  i usually use a little dollop of milk to make them fluffier  but i was out of milk so i used cremora  theyre wonderfully fluffy  thanks  can you explain why im more nervous now  than i was last night  i know its weird  im not sure what im supposed to do  should i shower here or should i shower at home  should i brush my teeth with my finger  so you dont know i packed a toothbrush  one thing i know im not doing is going to the bathroom here  why not  i can crank up the boom box like last night  forget it  chuckles  you in a hurry to get home for any other reason  cause uh  id love to spend the day with you  really  id love to spend the day with you too  great then heres the plan  ill take a walk around the block  while you go to the bathroom and then you do the same for me  well arent you a gentleman  phone rings  mike recording hi this is mike  i cant come to the phone right now  please leave me a message beep  peggy mikey its mom  i didnt sleep well last night  very fitful  but i dont want you to feel guilty  its probably just a little congestive heart failure  hey do you know if they make a home version  of those hospital defibrillators  you know in case i flatline  and you need to bring me back to life  come with me  ill shop around for something used  wait a second  youre not just having sex with me  because youre mad at your mom are you  is that a problem  no not really
