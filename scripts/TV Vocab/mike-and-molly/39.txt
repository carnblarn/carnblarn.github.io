anyway  fine after all the favors  ive done for you you cant help me out  this one time one time  are you forgetting last tuesday when you split your pants  and then asked me to color your underwear with a black sharpie  i didnt ask you to do that  well somebody must have cause i sure as hell  didnt volunteer for crack detail groans  man add some babys breath to it pull that thing together  i got this  that sunflower was a smart choice  after it dies she can snack on the seeds  you saw what i had to work with  but i still think you shouldve added a mylar balloon to it  nah that wouldve looked stupid  besides all they had left was bar mitzvah boy  and lordy lordy look whos forty  all right we still have enough time to put on  our nice clothes and head over to the restaurant  hey you didnt happen to bring an extra tie did you  whats wrong with the one you got on  i dont think a guys supposed to wear a black tie with a brown suit  i dont think a guys supposed to wear a brown suit  officers theres a man  up on that ledge i think hes gonna jump  aw perfect  are you happy  apparently happier than him  good evening  im officer michael biggs  call me mike   whats your name pal  what does it matter  im just another faceless cipher that nobody cares about  well hey im here arent i  now why dont you come on inside  and well talk about whatevers bugging you  she broke my heart  tossed me aside like garbage  little lady trouble huh  been there  quietly hows it going out here  everythings good  were talking not jumping right  how come theres no news vans and helicopters  this is valentines day the city is filled with jilted jumpers  youre lucky you got your own ledge  you hear that youre not the only fella in town  with a little case of the boohoos  apparently theres some guy on the michigan avenue bridge  dressed in a batman suit   that must be getting a lot of airplay  every channel  hey lets face it you cant compete with batman on a bridge  now why dont you come inside  yeah and if you still feel like jumping  do it on a slow news day  dress as an angry bird or bozo  oh my god you guys suck at this  sorry its been kind of a crazy day for us  im standing on a ledge  absolutely you win  worst day of anybody  better call the girls and tell them were running a little late  yeah  hey by the way  did you see hes got a dozen roses  laying on the bed i did   theyre beautiful  yeah so whichever way this plays out  i dont think hes gonna be needing those flowers  all right well get here as quick as you can  i am not saying that  fine  carl youre my dark chocolate treat  now just get here  everything okay  yeah its some emergency at work  so theyre running a little late  carl said we should order the drinks and appetizers  so mm done and done  its a swanky joint isnt it  mike mustve charmed somebody to get us this good table  and to get them to turn a twotop  into a fourtop at the last minute huh  last minute no  mike said he and carl set this up over a month ago  yeah they did  groans  mike piggybacked on your romantic night didnt he  not at all  we were happy to share the reservation wi you guys  i shouldve known  when i brought up dinner he got that look he always gets  when hes caught in a lie or hes trying to sneak by me  with the plunger behind his back  its no big deal  the four of us can enjoy a meal together  its not like carl and i  were planning on making out at the table  no matter what he thinks  youre very sweet but ii just dont feel right about  you know what im just im just gonna go  what and leave me alone here on valentines day  at least have a drink before the guys get here  well maybe ondrink  but when mike does show up  were gonna let you guys have your night  and ill tear him a new one on the way home  sounds like a plan   champagne  ooh yeah  i yell better when im drunk  its gonna take me a few more minutes to finish  so if you need to leave for your date i can let myself out  and dont worry i wont do anything weird  like sift through your laundry basket or lay in youbed  no worries  im staying in tonight  ironic huh  youre sexy and beautiful and im awkward and dumpy  yet were both floating in the same lonely boat  mmhmm  did you say you were almost done  right right  it is gonna be weird  spending valentines day by myself though  ive actually never done it before  oh its a piece of cake  and six or seven donuts and usually a pint of ice cream  that sounds cozy  just staying home and veggin out  oh you got to make it fun  otherwise youll blow your brains out  why dont you grab some ice cream  and ill find a romantic comedy  two spoons  better not im still on my diet  but would it be too weird if i watched you eat it  a little weird  but this whole conversation is weird  perhaps a little ambience will increase my rather bleak odds  classical music playing  youre really gonna make me go out on that ledge  you know i cant stand heights  hey i do all the driving and all the foot chases  least you can do is climb out on an icy ledge  and bring that nut job inside  i heard that  just hug the building youll be fine  come on get lost  get lost  oh god  dont look down dont look down  okay  im gonna sit carl im gonna sit  i got you man youre tied to the radiator  whats the radiator tied to  watch it  sorry just lashing out  i get it  youre a decent guy  if that woman doesnt appreciate you  then she doesnt deserve you  everything was going so well  then she stopped returning my calls  then she changed her number  then her boyfriend made her get a restraining order  well gals are fickle  and i know things seem really bleak right now  but the right woman can come along when you least expect it  thats what happened to me  you got a girlfriend  why are you acting so surprised  i didnt mean anything by it  boy youre sensitive  the girls said the entre came  osso buocco with pumpkin ravioli  and here i am eating cold french fries off a room service tray  you didnt charge that to my room did you  is that what you choose to focus on now  carl take it easy  its his first valentines day with a girlfriend  hes got a girlfriend too  exactly  and the two of us didnt give up neither should you  why dont you come inside and well talk  im not coming inside until she sees me on tv  and falls in love with me all over again  i wouldnt use the word falls  man he aint gonna jump  carl what are you doing  im gonna get this fool off the ledge  scooch over im not scooching anywhere  im suctioncupped to this ledge  fine then ill climb over you  whoa  oh god i got you i got you  you go i go you go i go  you guys are freaking me out  shut up and grab his belt you nut job  i got you buddy  come on  playing classical music  oh oh beautiful  just gorgeous  next time i come back  i expect you to know the devil went down to georgia  you have got to try this olive oil gelato  oh my god thats delicious  i know  you wouldnt think it would work but it does  chuckles  boy carl did a great job  i mean everything is perfect  youre aery lucky woman  yeah well so are you girl  mike is a wonderful man  yeah i know  andand i did tell him you know  not to do anything special tonight  but i didnt think hed run with it  laughs  i have to say  this is one of the nicest valentines days ive ever had  me too  both laugh  its kind of a perfect evening  i mean yyeah i you know i wish the guys were here  sure  we need somebody to get the cars and the coats  both laugh  hey ladies sorry were late and we cant stay  why whats going on  this man saved my life tonight  come on carl the girls dont need to hear about my heroics  technically i saved two lives tonight  while valiantly battling my own fear of heights  wow  we got gelato  im glad you had a good time  we need to head over to the station  and fill out some reports  these are for you  ah oh  theyre beautiful  and these are for you  theyre lovely  marry me or ill kill myself  straight from the heart  listen everything you do is straight from the heart  i hope they pin a medal on that big chest  laughs good night ladies good night  see you at home night  id be happy to drive if you want me to  oh no i will man the chariot brave warrior  do you want to dance  i thought youd never ask  even though ive seen this movie dozens of times  it never fails to melt this tough exterior  thanks for keeping me company tonight  i really appreciate it  no problemo  and by the way if any of my friends or perhaps my mother  asks me what i did tonight  would you be offended if i told them i had a date  i wouldnt be offended in the least  and youre more than welcome to do the same  thank you  i probably wont  breakfast at tiffanys i love that movie
