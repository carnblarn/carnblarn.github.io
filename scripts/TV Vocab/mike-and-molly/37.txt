                1 so you kids must be getting pretty excited  about the big day  yeah molly and i both love super bowl sunday  wedding wedding  oh  well everythings all squared away at st barts  and if you slip the organist 15 bucks  shell play anything you want  now i warn you shes 85 and incontinent  so those low notes aint always coming from the organ  okay well good to know  sounds like well be using the ceiling fans  oh and at some point  youll have to sit down with father tim  its a formality really  he just has to confirm youre a boy and youre a girl  and both planning on staying that way  well what if i was both then i wouldnt need mike  chuckles  make sure she doesnt crack wise in front of the good father  he drinks hes got a temper and hes not a big fan of women  so where you having the reception  we found this place thats actually pretty nice  and its walking distance from the church  great so i got to traipse around the dirty streets  of chicago wearing high heels and a taffeta gown  im sorry  youre wearing a taffeta gown  not if i got to hoof it to the reception  wind comes along catches my skirt  everybody gets a freebie  oh  well thats a visual  i dont know why you dont have  the reception in the church basement  its clean its free  you lay down a couple of sheets of plywood  you got a dance floor  well that certainly sounds festive  in a hoedowny kind of way  but mike and i were thinking  we dont want to do it in a basement ma  fine blow your money  your kids can go to community college and have crooked teeth  about the seating arrangements  im at the head table next to my boy right  actually we were thinking that mike and i would sit  at a sweetheart table  and everybody else would be seated around us  not much space in your spotlight is there  so wheres that put me near to the kitchen door  with one of your humpback uncles  well we thought by eliminating the head table  things would be a little less awkward  between you and mikes dad  come again  abort abort  i thought you two already talked about this  you invited your deadbeat dad and his hellbound whore  to come to our wedding  well its still kind of up in the air with the whore

talked to you about that  and he assured me he had  lying to you already is he  well the apple dont fall too far from the tree  his father told me he joined the national guard  and the only truth to that story was he was spending  every other weekend in the bush  its not like hes picking his father over you  i mean they only talk on the phone maybe once a month  and hes just seen him a few times since you guys divorced  what oh my god  dont you guys tell each other anything  i was in labor for nine hours  with that 13pound backstabber  turned my uterus into a windsock  and this is how he thanks me  see now this is the kind of open dialogue  you two should be having  were done here  come on if you and mike would just talk about this  talkings over  fine  let you ladies get back  to planning tomorrows nutritious menu  who am i kidding we all know its crap  oh  let it go lynette  dont waste your third strike on her  victoria im your biggest fan   ill follow you until you love me

need to finish up on mr whitmore  what happened to him  poor old thing just keeled over shoveling his front walk  see  thats why i always pay the neighbor kid to do it  let them die in the snow  oh gives me the creeps  but youre a cop  you must see dead bodies all the time  sure but we just tag em and bag em  we dont mousse and spruce  dont know how you have the stomach for it  well everybody dies  and i just want to make them look their best  for whatever is waiting for them on the other side  sure might as well hedge your bets  if there is an afterlife  you dont want to be the ugly one  right  i mean who knows what the next dimension holds for us  we could come back as a dog or a monkey  or a head of cabbage  that would be my luck  after a lifetime of choking down salads  to come back as a big bowl of slaw  or maybe this is it  and we should make the most of it  while were here  thats what im doing  living my life to the fullest  so when im laying here like mr whitmore  i will have a peaceful smile on my face  and it wont have to be sewn on  with two big hooks and fishing wire  do you actually do that  i had to do it to this one  when they rolled him in he was not a happy camper  well nobody likes to shovel their driveway  cell phone ringing  ah great  hey mom  ii cant understand what youre saying  molly told you what  i got to take this  ill be right there  that about does it mr whitmore  mmm  you look very handsome  good luck on your journey  and may your next life be filled with love  happiness and hopefully a snowblower  im your biggest fan   ill follow you until you love me   papa paparazzi  baby theres no other superstar   mike what do you want from me  hes my father  i cant just cut him out  of my life completely why not  he wrote the both of us off  the minute he walked out that door  and followed his boner all the way to pompano beach  knock at door  i hate to interrupt  but its cold in the car and i got to tinkle  what the hell is she doing here  she needed a ride  through the dining room and to the right  thanks i was waiting for a lull in the fight  but that never happened  and ive been pounding mountain dew  since 700 this morning  hi jim continue  as far as im concerned  theres nothing else to talk about  you chose your father over me plain and simple  mom its my wedding day  is it too much to ask for you  to put your differences aside for one hour  one hour  you ever been to a catholic wedding  after three hours of stand sit and kneel  youre looking at the crucifix  thinking hes the lucky one  you know what i give up  come to my wedding dont come to my wedding  do what you want cause after all its your special day  it was  now you can spend it with your precious daddy  and your stepmommy the prostitute  hey maybe you can book her for the bachelor party  sorry  ill get out of your hair  love your house by the way  thanks  is this where mike grew up  you mean is this where i cooked and cleaned  and sacrificed the flower of my youth  to raise that ungrateful lout  yeah  it is  bought it in 72  his father got it on the gi bill  only smart thing that son of a bitch ever did  other than marrying you right  i gave him a son and a home and how did he repay me  by running off with some tramp  and leaving me with a ninthgrader  who could outeat a family of beavers  well you did a wonderful job with that little beaver  hes kind and thoughtful and thats because of you  yeah well it wasnt easy  but im a nurturer  always have been  cant turn it off  so why wouldnt you want to go to the wedding  and show that exhusband of yours  what you were able to do without him  oh i wouldnt dream of using the kids special day  to grind a 20yearold axe  if it was me i would be  rolling up to that wedding  with my hair done a face full of makeup  and a dress short enough to show off those legs  which have held up very nicely  well i squaredance and do water aerobics  it shows  id kill for those things  but i did get lucky in the boob department  yes you did  they are high and ample  car horn honking  hey if you change your mind  and end up going to the wedding  i would be happy to do your makeup for you  ah i dont think so  i have great new lipstick  if it can give a dead person kissable lips  imagine what it cado for you  later jimbo  shes not wrong about my sticks  at the public pool  people used to mistake me for annmargret  great now because she wont budge  i got to call my dad and break his heart  sorry mike sighs  cell phone ringing  what now  mom what a nice surprise  long time no harp  what  really

and thanks  boy thats weird  i wonder what made her change her mind  well im guessing its not easy  to stay mad at a guy like you forever  i dont know shes been doing  a pretty good job of it for the last 35 years  who knows what brought her around  life is filled with mystery  and just think if i was a monkey  and you were a bowl of coleslaw  we wouldnt even be having this conversation  all right
