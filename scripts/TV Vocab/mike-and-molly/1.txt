how no ones ever gonna love me  and you know how im gonna spend  the last few years of my life alone in a dark apartment  my only companions  six or seven cats that made the mistake of wandering  into my gravitational field  the bottom line is ii know those voices are lying  and i know all i gotta do is  work this program one day at a time  thats why i start every morning by getting on my knees

police officer actually does  my dad says you guys are all on the take  gary i told you not  no no ththats okay  well gary thats one of the misconceptions i was talking about  now i know on tv and in the movies  they like to make you think that theres a lot of corruption  my mom says you guy only go after people of color  well geez  thats not true at all  you calling my mom a liar  whwhy dont we save all of our questions for the end  well you know what this is good  i mean questions lead to a giveandtake  and stimulate discussion  how can you be a cop and be so fat  you know maybe we should save  the questions till after  hey i have a question no you dont  oh but i do  no you dont  what made you want  to become a police officer in the first place  oh thats a great question  well i became a police officer  because my dad was a police officer  he worked the same beat for 30 years  a fiveblock radius in the wicker park area  and since our last name is biggs  he used to refer to it as biggs mile  as a kid i always thought he was saying big smile  i remember watching him leaving in the morning  his uniform would always be pressed  and his shoes shined like mirrors  id say to him dad where are you going  and hed say biggs mile son  and since i thought he was saying big smile  id give him a big smile  anyway everybody in that neighborhood loved him  cause he kept the place safe  and he treated everyone with respect  he made police work look like like a pretty noble profession  right up until the very end  what happened did he die  no he fell in love with a prostitute  divorced my mom and moved to tampa  tore the whole family apart  i probably should have stopped at noble profession  i really appreciate you doing this  i think the kids got a lot out of it  oh hey they seem like a good group  except the one with the mouth  hes on a hellbound train  gary yeah  i caught him sniffing the dryerase markers  thats not gonna end pretty  okay well um thanks again for inviting me  youre welcome  it was nice of you to come  oh it was my pleasure  so  what made you want  to become a teacher  i really dont remember  i gotta go  oh oh okay bye  bye  hey would you like
