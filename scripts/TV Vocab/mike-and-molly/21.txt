alone  contemplating where my life went so horribly wrong  everybody could use a little me time  samuel would you  ill get my coat okay  did you get enough to eat samuel  i am perfectly satiated dinner was delightful  what did you call that dish again  pot roast you serve it at abes i had it wednesday  listen i know things seem pretty grim right now  but im sure something will turn up  you know when i first graduated from cosmetology school  there were no jobs anywhere  and i thought oh my god  i just wasted three weeks of my life  so how did you find work  right place right time  thats actually four words  you know what just  anyway  i was dating this funeral director and one day  i was taking a little disco nap in a empty casket  you know like you like you do  uhhuh  and a client came in and thought i looked very natural  and asked who did my makeup  i popped up and said that would be me hon  well before that woman came to  i was embarking on an exciting new career  cosmetician to the recently deceased  see is those kinds of inspirational stories  that brought me to this country  that one made it all the way to africa huh  can i get you another glass of wine  well how could i say no to a woman as beautiful as you  oh my god youre so charming  i cant believe youre unemployed and homeless  i know youll find a job  and i know mike is happy to have you stay at his place  until you get back on your feet  well hopefully i can accomplish that in the next 48 hours  you said hit the bricks in two days right  mike  im just trying to keep a fire lit under his ass  oh  hes here most of the time anyway  so you can have his place as long as you need it  whoa whoa whoa lets not get carried away  oh really youre giving me that face  samuel  youre welcome to stay at my place for as long as you need  thank you mike  you know sometimes i think your body is so big  just to accommodate the size of your heart  oh what a beautiful way to say youre fat  so  what is the deal with mollys sister  hands off shes already got a boyfriend without a job  well i just thought if shes half as wonderful as molly is  all right look im onto you pal  i see the little game youre playing  what game mike  im simply commenting on what a lucky man you are  yeah i get it  i have so much and you have so little  is that supposed to be me  yes it is  and dont pretend like that accent  doesnt thicken up like gravy when there are women around  you know perhaps it is better  if i just wander the streets till morning  abes opens at 500  oh wait i cant go there anymore  look im dropping you off at my place  but were stopping at the  so you can start looking for a job first thing in the morning  of course  and youre filling out an application at the 7eleven  absolutely  and listen mike  i cannot thank you enough for your generosity  in my homeland you would be revered as a king  there would be a festival in your honor  women would name their children after you  your picture would be on money  all right what do you want now my car  only when youre not using it  so is samuel still crashing at your place  yep meanwhile im stuck at mollys  with her recycling rules  and clipping my toenails over the toilet  i dont know how much longer i can take it carl  yep mans got to have his own space  i tell you if i didnt have my lawn chair in the garage  cohabitation with my grandma would be an impossibility  hey  why you flatfoots still come back here  i told you before no more free lunch  abe come on things got a little heated the other day  but samuels a really good kid and he really needs this job  is too late position has already been filled  soojin customer  she very good worker  and since she my wife it dont cost me one sweet dime  what is it now  i am watching oprah waiting for  my ahha moment and you not it  darling  please bring coffee to these two gentlemen  shell be right back with your beverage  hang on are you telling me  that pretty young thing is your wife  why not im a successful goodlooking man  shes the big winner here  so you can cover her fingers in diamonds  but you cant give samuel a 50cent raise  samuel dont dress up like catholic schoolgirl  and call me sweet papa  oh thank you baby  two large grapefruit juice  we wanted coffee  i wanted ben affleck but i get him  what the hell have you done with my apartment  and why are you wearing my drapes  oh mike i didnt know you were stopping by  i need to grab some clean clothes before i go to mollys  what is that smell  im preparing a traditional african meal  what is that two missionaries in a crockpot  very funny  anyway i would invite you to stay but  i have a lady friend coming over  please tell me its not mollys sister  oh no no no she gave me a fake number  so hang on  you dont have a job yet but youve managed to find a date  its amazing what women will overlook  if you have your own apartment  but who am i talking to  yeah yeah  hey who told you you could move my furniture around  i was doing you a favor  the feng shui in here was atrocious  when i open the front door  i like to feel invited into the room  yeah i get that about you  hows the job hunt going  i am weighing a few options  i dont want to rush into  a career path im not comfortable with  repeat after me  paper or plastic  would you like fries with that  knock me in the water and win a stuffed bear  can we table this discussion  my lady friend will be here momentarily  look samuel  you need to find a job so you can get an apartment  of your own and i can have my place back  hey maybe your evening will go well  and you can move in with your new girlfriend  oh i dont think thats a good idea  i believe its important for a man  to have his own space dont you  you know im starting to think  you didnt leave africa willingly  you got kicked out  hey i was a political refugee  you dont know the torment and struggle it took  for me to get to america  where i can cherish the freedoms that you take for granted  the fact that they kicked me out is beside the point  man i cant find anything in this dump  and by dump do you mean the house i grew up in  that my dead father built  im sorry its just that i hate living out of a suitcase  you dont have to i cleared out some closet space  and a couple of drawers for you  no no point in me settling in  as soon as samuels out of there im back to my place  yeah but that could be a couple of weeks maybe a month  and whose fault is that  judging from your tone i guess you think its mine  look molly  i know whats going on here  its in every gals nature to want to nest  with an alpha male  really lets go on  well as much as i hope one day  well be living under the same roof  im just not ready for that right now  oh i get it  youre like a wild untamed stallion  and here i am trying to hook you up to a plow  i said its not your fault  its your womanly instincts  im not quite following you  but thats probably just because  im burdened with this crazy lady brain  you know  look im not saying youre trying to trap me  as much as reel me in  i see less horse more fish  cause you know what if i really wanted to trap you  id dig a really big hole in the backyard  and cover it with moon pies  see youre getting angry  i told you i dont blame you  its your dna  looks like one of those giant manatees  sunning itself on a big rock  you know thats where the legends  of the mermaids come from  sailors would often mistake them for women  well to me that just sounds like a lame excuse  for some bad behavior  whoa where am i  it would appear the doghouse  i dont know what you did to pee on her parade  but if you slept on the couch  youre still in midstream  morning mom vince   morning  good morning  morning  im guessing time has not healed these wounds  yeah i picked up on that too  iid wait till she had her coffee  otherwise shes a real ballbuster  i heard that  its true  got a crick in my neck  from camping out on the sofa last night  oh no what a shame  poor thing  you look very pretty this morning wellrested  well its easy to sleep when youve got nothing on your mind  but lipstick and mantrapping  okay look i never said trap  but i am sorry for you know  acting like an ass  well i wouldnt necessarily say ass oh  big baby thoughtless moron uh  lets just go with ass  you know i was trying to be nice and accommodating  to you and your friend and what do i get in return  accusations that im trying to trap you  let her drink her coffee  stay out of it mom  i understand you wanting your own space believe me  having the bed to myself last night was like a minivacation  i could stretch out  i didnt have to worry about your arm slamming down  on my head like a giant meat log  im sorry molly  its not that i dont want to stay with you  i just like having my apartment as kind of a safety net  so do i im not ready for us to live together  well good  because even if i dont use it i like knowing its there  yeah  kinda like the milky way  you keep hidden behind your ice trays  you know about that  ive replaced it three times  ive replaced it four times  hey you dont keep one here do you  in the vegetable crisper  mom  im sorry i asked for scrambled this is over easy  now scrambled  that woman is the worst waitress in the world  who cares look at her  she could bring me a urinal cake and id eat it  hey samuel what are you doing here  abe called me out of the blue  and offered me my job back with the raise he promised  i told you man you stayed strong and you won  i know carl im so glad i listened to you  you are clearly the brains of the team  well next time you could crash at his place  i hope you like the top bunk  and waking up to a faceful of model airplane  dont worry ill be out of your home as soon as  i can put together enough for first and last months rent  security deposit and the premium cable package  im afraid youve spoiled me  oh samuel samuel  welcome back  you and me are good right  yeah were good  all right go fire my wife  okay so 50 cent an hour raise makes 20 a week  this should cover till the end of the month  nice when payoff go the other way huh serpico  whats going on  you covering samuels raise  id have paid twice as much to get him out of my apartment  although i got to admit  he did a nice job redecorating the place  i know i saw it the other night when i went to his party  party
