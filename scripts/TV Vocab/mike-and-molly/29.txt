bring him into our home  victoria hes not a weirdo hes a musician  molly you dont know anything about this guy  for all you know he could be a serial killer  victoria serial killers dont offer to clean your windshield  and tell you youre hot  molly yes yes they do  victoria shouting  youre not a serial killer are you  nope  i only ask because of your mansonesque quality  its cool i get that a lot  molly you cant keep bringing home these strays  you gotta grow up youre 30 years old  victoria hey be quiet  he thinks im jailbait  let me ask your opinion as a musician  molly and victoria shouting  do you think i need to take dance lessons  that depends are you dancing now  you just dont get it cause im blowing your mind  for the first time in my life   i see love    got a full day ahead of me  and i got three hours of sleep last night  when did victoria and the missing link  finally stop doing it  uh a little after 400  thats the last time i heard oh yeah right there baby  you know i could do it for that long too  i just think you can make your point in far less time  let me tell you something last nights noisy  bootybootybangban was a dig at me  when she knocked over that lamp  come on its so clich  you know im capable of pulling an allnighter too  its just that youre so darn sexy  its like holding in a sneeze  good morning mike  and only mike  morning  sugar  oh yeah there it is  ah thats the sweet stuff  oh yeah  oh im sorry did dylan and i keep you up last night  no we slept like babies  right after we made love  for an appropriate amount of time  so what time did prince charming  finally skateboard back to the mobil station  for your information hes still here  well you need to get him out because were all going to work  he can leave when he gets up  no we cannot leave a stranger alone in this house  what if he steals from us  dylan is not a thief  how would you know that  because he doesnt have anything  a thief would have all sorts of stuff  shes got you there  i should go  bye sweetie  have a good day mike  and only mike  it was scary the way those girls were going at it  normally its a very peaceful household  but things started to get pretty hot  you talking about hairpulling  nailscratching and nipple twisting  what no they were just arguing  oh well then you and i have very different ideas  of what hot is my friend  by the way i cant make it tonight molly and i have plans  man its roller derby night  foxy chicks on skates  look like a fool sitting there by myself  sorry molly wants us to be all graceful for the wedding  so she signed us up for dance classes  youre taking dance classes can i go watch that  that sounds way better than the roller derby  and im guessing twice as many women will be knocked down  i dont know why i have to take these stupid classes  for a big man im actually very light on my feet  i think your feet would have a different opinion  hey i can fake my way  through two minutes of slow dancing at my wedding  i think im gonna have to side with molly on this one  its your first dance and all eyes on you  not to mention video cameras and cell phones  yeah that stuff gets on the internet  and for the next 20 years people are gonna be googling  fat guy backs into wedding cake  although it will never be as funny as fat cop chases hat  mm  i cant believe you put that on youtube  hey i made you famous  as of last week that thing was up to a hundred thousand hits  youre beating the masturbating kangaroo  great its gone  your boyfriend stole my ipod  think it through molly if he was gonna steal from us  why would he have borrowed money too  well if youre planning on sleeping with him again  youre gonna do it at his place  i cant stay at his place  they dont allow women at the halfway house  molly now back off  yes your sister has a faulty picker  but we dont know for sure that this particular dirtbag  is a thief  thank you mom  fine lets pretend that we havent lost several  major appliances after one of victorias conjugal visits  yeah i do miss that margarita machine  my night stand looks naked without it  and what kind of a grown man wants a bread maker  the kind of man that likes to bake fresh bread  for his wife and children  sweetie maybe you should think about  a more thorough screening process for your fellas  you always take her side because you think shes the smart one  victoria and if were gonna accuse each others boyfriends of stealing  why dont you ask your boyfriend  what happened to all my pudding cups  uhoh  sorry about your pudding  maybe you could hide em better  shes such a knowitall  how do you put up with her  well the fact that she has sex with me  buys her a lot of goodwill  im so sick of her telling me what to do  i realize sometimes she can come off like kind of a pit bull  but just remember its coming from a very caring place  neither of them like anybody i bring home  doesnt matter if its an unemployed drummer  or a married orthodontist who likes bread  well as long as youre living with your mom and your sister  theyre always gonna be looking out for the baby of the family  but im not a baby  i know youre a beautiful girl  with a wonderful trusting nature  but a lot of guys will take advantage of that  i lead with my heart mike  and my breasts  i mean my breasts are on top so they kind of get there first  mom maybe if you didnt baby her all the time  she wouldnt act so immature  well maybe if you had sense enough to hide your things  when there are strangers in the house  youd still have your ipod  oh great so now its my fault  because i didnt hide my belongings in my own house  molly give me a break im trying to get drunk here  victorias outside and shes pretty upset  oh really shes upset  yeah crying and everything  so maybe you ladies could just i dont know  maybe cut the poor kid a little slack  listen buddy dont come waltzing into my house  and tell me how to run things  speaking of waltzing im taking dance classes  well you should be taking shut your piehole classes  mom  i dont need you telling me how to raise my girl  and stick to the areas you know best  the cupboard and the fridge  wow gun to a knife fight  mom that is my fianc and a member of this family and you  should be a little bit more considerate of his feelings  oh were being considerate now  well maybe someone should consider  locking the bathroom door  if theyre gonna weigh themselves buck naked  thats really the only way to get an accurate reading  my underwear alone weighs almost two pounds  waltz playing  heads high eyes on your partner  ive had to be the responsible one  in that house my entire life its not fair  do you think its fair  uh i dont know  well dont you have an opinion  no maam i do not why not  because that piehole comment kind of  knocked the marbles out of my bag  one two three  two two three  eyes up  how am i supposed to know what my feet are doing  im the only adult living there  i have to make sure the bills get paid  and i have to maintain the house and work a fulltime job  and if it wasnt for me  those two would be living in a dumpster  fighting cats for chicken bones  eyes up  yeah i got it  im gonna drygulch that broad  you know what im done being the responsible one  they can live their lives however they want  different man every night  wine glasses in the shower i dont care anymore  they think im too controlling well no more  so you think maybe i could lead for a little while  oh yeah sorry  both laughing  hey you know what would be a great  first dance at the wedding  the limbo  you cant do the limbo  doesnt matter  bride and groom hold the stick  there you are  well while youve been out dancing the night away  your sisters upstairs packing to move out  what thats horrible  please she threatens to move out once a month  she packed her bong  all right ill go talk to her  what family doesnt have its share of drama huh  piehole got it  wow you actually got moving boxes this time  not your normal stomping down the stairs  carrying a pair of shoes and a diaphragm  thank you for reminding me  come on i know youre doing this just to get back at me  no im not  you dont know everything  see heres your stupid ipod  what are you doing with it  thought it was my lighter  so whos the idiot now  you know none of this wouldve happened  if molly hadnt given victoria such a hard time  about that creepy boy  mmhmm  i mean not that molly hasnt brought home  her fair share of losers  no offense  mmhmm  hey either add to the conversation  or go wait in the garage with all the other tools  you really want my opinion  cause you know its gonna come out of my piehole  spill it  all right i think molly might be  a bit overprotective of her sister  because sometimes youre kind of more of a friend than a parent  you calling me a bad mother  no im calling you a good friend  let me tell you something  theres one parent in this house  and youre looking at her  look i didnt mean to imply  all i hear is mommy i need this  mommy i need that  mommy can i borrow 2800  wow victoria owes you 2800  no the smart one does  oh come on victoria stop this  you know i love you and i just want whats best for you  well then you need to let this eagle soar  sighs i am not trying to keep you from soaring  im trying to keep you  from flying into a homeless shelter  i have to move out of here  or youll never treat me like an adult  thats not true  i just want you to make smarter choices  molly the smart choices are not always the right choices  yeah they kind of are  here we go its just like mike said  youre a pit bull  and i gotta get as far away from you as i can  mike said that  let me tell you something if i had a dollar  for every time molly wanted to borrow money from me  shed want to borrow that too  all right victorias moving out  mike why dont you help her  since this was your brilliant idea  what  you told my baby to move out god no  oh dont remember telling the eagle to soar huh  how about calling your fianc a pit bull  now before you see it as a bad thing  pit bulls are actually sweet loving dogs  its the owners who make them mean  is that another shot at how i raised my kids  god no  victoria mom i love you  but i have to do this  its the only way right mike  ooh look victoria if this is about  our conversation on the front porch  you shouldnt pay any attention to me  i really got my head up my ass  itd sure fit  and why are you listening to him in the first place  contrary to popular opinion molly  im the parent in this house  gasps  you told her what i said  hey some people arent good with secrets  some people arent good with money  piehole  i told you i would pay you back with our wedding money  wait youre already spending our wedding money  mike now is not the time  and i dont appreciate you gossiping about me to my fianc  oh im sorry mommy  are you gonna send me to bed without any supper  what difference would it make  you drink your dinner anyway  hey i am the one moving out  this is supposed to be about me  see i told you its all for show  oh i know that  but a good mother fakes concern  stop it stop it  youre tearing me apart  and just so you know  ive had exactly two glasses of wine  those arent glasses theyre aquariums with stems  joyce hey if it wasnt for the wine  the two of you wouldnt even be here  molly yeah with the way you drink  i should have 15 sisters  dont worry molly  youd still be the smart one  victoria why do we even have a lamp there  both sigh heavily  i cant go back in there carl  ive made a mess of things  and two of them have seen me wet and naked  lot of victims in that scenario  but look this is the life youve chosen  so suck it up and get in that house  will you come in with me  hell no  can i come home with you  man cowardice does not become you  this is what being in a relationship is all about  you know youre not just marrying her  youre marrying all three of them crazy bitches  what happened to my life  im living in a nuthouse  i gotta shower in a jock strap  and dance class was the highlight of my week  youre also gonna get to spend the rest of your life  with the woman that you love  and yeah theres gonna be some ups and downs  but all in all youre one lucky man  yeah i guess youre right  so strap on your helmet cover your nuts  and bellycrawl to the bedroom  ill see you tomorrow  i really hope so  laughter  hey honey  whered you go  uh i grabbed a couple of beers with carl  mom and victoria made some rice krispie treats  if you want a little dessert  sure  so everythings good  everybodys staying  of course  where would anybody be going  okay  im gonna grab one of those rice krispie treats  have as many as you want  you enjoy  all laughing hysterically  what the hell kind of game are they playing
