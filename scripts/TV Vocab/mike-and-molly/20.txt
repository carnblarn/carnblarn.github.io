                   hi my names mike im an over eater  all hi mike  i had a pretty good week i lost two more pounds  applause  and that was before i cut my hair flossed my teeth  and pulled a dust bunny from my belly button  so lets just call it an even three  my point is the winter weight is slowly starting to melt away  that doesnt mean im out of the woods yet  in fact im looking at what could be  the biggest food challenge of the year  for any chicago sports fan  im talking about opening day at wrigley field  attendees murmur all right cold beer  chili dogs salted peanuts  those little cups of chocolate ice cream  you know that you eat with the tiny wooden spoon  youre still sucking the flavor out of the wood grain  while youre ordering the next one  but this year im sticking to my diet  im pitching a noeater  when i stand up for the seventhinning stretch  therell be no crumbs peanut shells or candy wrappers  falling from my vintage ryne sandberg cubs jersey  its all about discipline  im going to keep my eyes on the ball  away from the vendors  and pray to god we dont go into extra innings  im gonna do it this year but more importantly  the cubbies are gonna do it this year  im planning on dieting through the playoffs  all the way to the world series  now whos with me  cubs cubs  cubs cubs cubs cubs cubs  for the first time in my life   i see love   man im looking forward to this game  and this year i got a new pair of blue blocker sunglasses  so i aint losing any more foul balls to the sun  you didnt lose that ball in the sun  you lost that ball to a sixyearold girl  she bit me  ah baseball season again  you know we have something similar in my country  no kidding samuel yes  one man stands in the field holding a large stick  another man throws a stone at him  then the man with the stick  chases the man who threw the stone  oh and you call that baseball  no its called stay away from my goats  you rockthrowing bastards  similar to your sport except instead of hot dogs and beer  we have drought and starvation  go cubbies  scoffs  hey carl what would you think about um  me asking molly to go to the game with us sure  why dont i ask my grandma to go too  better yet lets just skip the game  and we can all just make a quilt and do each others hair  a simple i dont care for the idea would suffice  well im just saying opening day is our tradition  and besides we only got the two tickets  yeah but i could trade those two for three in the bleachers  what i stood in line all night for those fieldlevel tickets  i had to pee in my thermos  but mollys my girlfriend  and i should include her in everything i do  because shared experiences and memorable moments  are what bring a couple closer together  youre reading her magazines now arent you  i cant help it she leaves them in the crapper  and the sports section only gets me halfway home  look theres nothing wrong with you guys  doing things apart from each other  yeah but isnt that one of the top ten warning signs  that your man is cheating  dude seriously you got to read a little less  and push a little harder  oh thats where my cosmo went  yeah i wanted to finish this article  on finding the female gspot  got to be honest looks like a twoman job  yeah or a onewoman job  hey i only have to work a halfday tomorrow  i was thinking we could go grab lunch  oh i cant im going to the cubs game with carl  you guys are going to opening day  ah thats great  yeah i wasnt trying to exclude you from anything  this is just an annual ritual that i have with carl  i get it its a guy thing  exactly its like growing a beard or peeing standing up  might not be fair but i didnt make the rules  actually im okay with being excluded  from both of those things chuckles  besides its baseball  youd probably be bored to tears  no i love baseball  used to go to the games all the time with my dad  wed take the el to the ballpark  id sit on his lap and keep the scorecard  some of my best memories of him are at those baseball games  really yeah  that was our special time together  just me and my pop  you know i havent gone to a single game since he died  youre kidding no  so i completely understand  how much this tradition means to you guys  good night sweetie  sleep tight  grandma now michael  be sure and make a big fuss over carltons new baseball mitt  hes been breaking that thing in all month  i promise to ooh and ah  im just happy to see the boy  oiling something other than himself  hey what are you doing here so early  batting practice doesnt start for another 45 minutes  im just excited to get to the park  cheering on my favorite team with my best buddy  oh we got to make one little stop on the way  what stop no big deal hey is that a new mitt  ooh ah  you invited molly to come with us didnt you  oh man  i knew youd fold  i had to she used to go to the games  with her dead dad theyd take the train  theyd sit in each others laps  i dont know you got to hear her tell it  and because of that i got to sit in the bleachers  hey i didnt kill the man why do i have to be punished  ill sit in the bleachers you two can sit down front  oh i see you get to enjoy the game  while i entertain your girlfriend  fine then you sit in the bleachers  which is exactly what you wanted  boy quit going on and on  you talking about a baseball game  acting like michael stood you up for the junior prom  well he asked me to go first  is it any wonder that everybody at my church  has you in their special prayers  listen well take turns in the bleachers  i promise i wont let her ruin our day  fine she can come  but i am not the third wheel  she is the third wheel  i get it were the motorcycle  and shes the sidecar no  were the winnebago and shes the little skidoo  were dragging behind us  hey this winnebago lost three pounds last week  well i already told you how good you looked  its just nice to hear once in a while  good lord  the two of them might as well move to las vegas  get a couple of white tigers and start a magic show  looky what i found  oh my god  dads old cubbie cap  laughing oh  ah it smells just like him  vitalis and old spice  laughs  dad sure loved the old spice didnt he mom  thats all you girls ever gave him for christmas  his birthday and fathers day  he used to have to slap it on pretty heavy  just to keep it from piling up  yeah i have a weird memory of him using that stuff  to start the grill  starting the grill  getting paint off his hands  killing ants  victoria oh my god  if you were a little bustier  youd look just like dad  boy he loved taking you to the games  you were his little tomboy  i remember as soon as wed get to the ballpark  hed always order his one beer  and then give me a little sip of the suds  well hed usually slam down four or five  before you even left the house  thats the reason you had to take the train  its going to be weird you know  iive never been to a game without him  dont worry  hell be there with you in spirit  i know hes sitting up there right now  looking down on all of us  hmm kind of like when he used to take  the lawn chair up on the roof  with a cooler of beer  yeah  except without the neighbors complaining  because hes throwing rocks at cars  or peeing in the drainpipe  carl ill be happy to sit in back  if you want to be up front  no im fine  didnt camp out overnight for those two seats  hmm what nothing  hes just being funny  laughs hey i really appreciate  you guys inviting me along  and dont think you have to give me  any special treatment  just consider me one of the fellas  shouldnt be a problem im able to consider carl  one of the fellas chuckles  see thats what we do for fun  we bust each others stones  give each other little zings hacha  oh well hey  you can do that with me too  feel free to give me little zings  and bust my stones  girls dont have stones  not her fault carl  okay look ii realize im a guest here  so i should be the one to take the seat in the bleachers  i agree no i think  we should work out some sort of seating schedule  i disagree hear me out  well rotate every couple innings  that way nobody feels left out  oh it sounds too complicated  oh its actually pretty easy  just in case ii worked out  a little roundrobin rotation where we alternate  every three innings and if we go extra innings  we just pull a name out of a hat  does anybody have a hat  chuckling  this is going to be fun huh  crowd land of the free   and the home of the brave   play ball  ooh  are you sure you dont mind  me eating this in front of you  dont worry about me  i got a tub of carrot sticks  americas favorite ballpark snack  im only having it for my dad  i get it its a ritual  that you shared with your father exactly  its a little tribute to my pop  well you enjoy it okay   oh my god  is it good  no  not at all  very disappointing in fact  i mean im going to finish it  because i dont i dont like to be wasteful  but this is not a good dog  not at all  thanks for sparing my feelings  just enjoy your hot dog  aw thank you  mmhmm  whoo  man look at the two of them down there in my seats  man i almost caught pneumonia getting those tickets  and here i am stuck in the bleachers  as a true cub fan i believe the bleachers provide the best  vantage point to fully appreciate and experience the game  uhhuh  plus you can reach up and grab a bird or touch an airplane  youre exaggerating for effect  but i did see a pigeon fly into a guys eye one time  it was against st louis 1995  i was sitting exactly where im sitting right now  im also wearing the same pants  bat striking ball  cheering  come on  let me ask you if the bleacher seats are so good why are you  staring at that little tv instead of looking at the field  i enjoy the color commentary  and the humorous anecdotes about the players  are you gonna be this confrontational throughout the entire game  im sorry im a little on edge ive been coming to opening day  for five years with my best friend and this year  he decided to bring his girlfriend  ouch but way cool to have a buddy with a girlfriend right  up high  down low too slow  chuckling  when my dad and i would always go to the games  it was my job to keep score  i always thought he did it to help me learn math  but i think now its because he was too hammered to hold a pen  oh wave wave wave  come on people  represent  wow i had no idea you were such a baseball fan  well if you didnt fall asleep after we had sex  you might learn a thing or two about me  hotcha  im busting your stones  you shouldve worn a cup  maybe i can borrow yours  hotcha  hey chuckles  thanks for bringing me today mike  i forgot how much i loved coming to these games  im glad youre here  the minute i cleared the turnstile i was just  flooded with so many memories  voice breaks some of the best times my dad and i ever had  were right here in this ballpark  sniffling all right sweetie its okay  no im fine im fine this is good  my dad was the best you know  if id have known i had such little time with him  cmon mol hold it together  sobbing loudly  shes a little upset  she thought it was bobblehead day  well looks like mollys  honoring her dad with a frosty malt  mmm  nothing like a ballpark hot dog huh  mmm its like heaven wrapped in a pig intestine  normally i would share  but your loudmouth friend ate half my nachos  and contrary to popular opinion im not the food fairy  no im set i got my carrot sticks  fresh off the grill of mother earth  if you already have a girlfriend why are you still on a diet  getting a girlfriend doesnt eliminate your problems  you still gotta watch what you eat the key is discipline  i am all about discipline thats why i got into karate  it provides me both mental and physical balance  uhhuh plus an excuse to walk around in drawstring pajamas  believe me a black belt isnt that impressive when its 52 inches long  ah well played sensei  hey pass it down  hey pal you gonna pass it or what  is it against the law for a man to smell a hot dog  bat strikes ball  cheering  sobbing i just always thought my dad would be there you know  to watch me graduate from high school or give me away at my wedding  but youre lucky  at least you got some good memories of your dad  my old man had to work two jobs just to make ends meet and i never saw him  ever  well if i didnt see his shoes i knew he was at work  and if i did see his shoes i knew i had to be quiet cause he was asleep  oh thats terrible  do you know i never got to see one baseball game with him  share some peanuts catch a foul ball  thats probably why i make such a big deal out of opening day  i get it you are  you and mike are doing something that you never got to do with your dad  and i intruded on that didnt i  yeah little bit  im so sorry carl  its all right  you didnt know any better  bat strikes ball  cheering  oh my god what an amazing day  its just like been cathartic you know  you should come on floppy hat or foam finger day  the vibe is palpable  may i interest a lovely lady in a nice draft beer  oh no thank you im fine  and taken by the way  oh thank goodness  getting a little tired of holding my stomach in  my boyfriend was the one sitting up here earlier  the portly gent with the carrot sticks  or the africanamerican who scarfed my nachos  the cute one with the carrots  hmm he did mention something about having a girlfriend  but these bleachers are full of guys  claiming to have girlfriends and their own cars  well he actually has both  i certainly cant compete with that  is it true he lost three pounds last week  yeah it is  man it comes so easy to the winners  carl im sure your dad loved you but he  had to work and provide for your family  i realize that but i missed so many moments with him because he wasnt there  hey my dad was there and we never talked to each other  we mustve gone to 50 ball games together  and didnt say two words to one another  thats horrible yeah  and every time i did try to talk to him  hed buy me a hot dog just to shut me up  you know once i asked him if he really loved my mom mmhmm  he bought me two chili dogs a piece of pizza  and a bucket of chicken on the ride home  and thats probably why you eat like you do  because youre stuffing your emotions down  because your daddy wouldnt talk to you  youre right  but not anymore the cycle ends here  im proud of you man  you know what im calling my dad in scottsdale  right now and im telling him that i forgive him  look at me carl  its the ninth inning and i have not had one hot dog  you want everything on it big guy  walk away walk away walk away  dad its carlton  bat strikes ball  cheering  hey  foul ball hey  that did not just happen  hey dad guess what  i just caught a foul ball  yeah  the bad news is the cubs lost  good news is mike biggs won  i got through opening day without gaining a pound  now if i could just get past easter memorial day  and fourth of july i should be fine  until the halloween candy hits the shelves  but one day at a time thank you  nice speech humorous yet heartfelt  glad you made it  youve inspired me to take control of my life  well if i can do it you can do it too  im cautiously optimistic  attendees hi joe  so is this it for the chicks  or do more show up when the cookies are laid out
