                1 guns firing explosions  mike get your shoes on lets go  im right in the middle of taking guadalcanal  and i cant abandon my battalion  those guys have families back home molly  they also have helmets and guns and im going to your mothers unarmed  oh cool you can shoot the coconuts  mimics explosion  your mothers gone to a lot of trouble making dinner for us  the least we can do is show up on time and pretend to enjoy ourselves  hey whatever were having she cooked and froze two years ago  she doesnt even know what it is till it melts  could be stew could be cake  just call her and tell her that were on our way  fine  if were late im gonna be the one getting the stink eye  from your mother and her ugly dog  hi mom just wanted to let you know were on our way  yeah were headed down the stairs right now  molly watch your step  oh dear god no  im fine mrs biggs well be there in about ten minutes  really  i took a shot  for the first time in my life   i see love   what was that dinner meat loaf  who knows mightve been banana bread  hey i wrapped up some leftover lasagna for you kids to take home  listen mikey if youre not doing anything tuesday afternoon  i could use a ride home from the hospital  the hospital whats going on  well according to dr needs a new sports car  my gallbladders on the fritz so they gotta cut me open and yank it out   why am i just hearing about about this  i didnt want to worry you  you know im not the type to dump my problems in somebody elses lap  mom you call me when the paperboy misses the front stoop  i think that perv does it on purpose to get me to bend over in my robe  hoping one of the girls flops out  so do you have a ride to the hospital  ill take the bus  i can put my money in my shoe and carry a can of bumbegone  no thats crazy im happy to drive you there and back  okay but after the surgery be sure to call the hospital  if i go toesup on the table  i dont want you to waste your gas or ruin your evening  mom dont say that youre gonna be fine  gallbladder surgerys actually pretty routine these days  oh i didnt know you were dating a trained physician  no im just saying its not necessarily a lifethreatening operation  hey any time you give a woman my age the gas  its a coin flip whether shell wake up or not  oh and by the way i put do not resuscitate instructions in my living will  im sure its not gonna come to that  well if it does dont let me lay there drooling  or making crazy vegetable talk  mom i am not gonna pull the plug on you  if youre too squeamish have your little girlfriend do it  just make sure theres no chance of recovery  before you let her kill me  mrs biggs i realize youre worried about this whole thing  but you shouldnt blow it out of proportion  this is the casket i want  its the solid mahogany classic with the tufted champagne satin lining  it looks nice  im sure youll be very comfortable  this is crazy  we dont need to worry about caskets and funerals  no you dont because your father and i made all the arrangements years ago  bought sidebyside plots picked out the headstone  and had our names carved on it  hang on a second youre saying somewhere in chicago theres  an empty grave with your name already on it  all you gotta do is drain me dump me  and get somebody with a decent voice to sing the old rugged cross  all right enough of this you are going to be fine  oh and youll need to get your dads name scraped off the headstone  if he thinks he can run off with that whore  and get a free dirt nap next to me hes very much mistaken  so youre gonna use the other grave for like what  storage or jim  no jim wants to be cremated and have his ashes scattered  either in the backyard or yosemite  really   and how do you know that  ive had him since he was a puppy  you just know  anyway mikey the extra grave is yours if you want it  well look thats very generous of you mom  but youre not going anywhere and im guessing  when the time does come ill be buried next to molly  what  mike we havent even bought a couch together yet  lets lets not get ahead of ourselves  right sorry  you might want to be cremated or be frozen like ted williams head  oh that reminds me i defrosted a pie  you werent serious about the burial thing right  no no i made a joke about being buried next to you  and you made a joke about not wanting to be  everybody was joking  everything is funny  man i love directing traffic  getting to wear the gloves  which in my book dress up any outfit  yeah its a lot of fun  standing in the snow waving my arms around like a fat mime  you dont see the poetry in it  we are the conductors and the cars are the orchestra  camry camry come on   dump truck hold   give me a little vespa here city bus   spoken like a man whos never been given the finger  by a shuttle van full of seniors  you know you are very negative today  from the moment i picked you up this sucks thats bad  turn off the radio stop talking  stop talking  look at this i ordered two eggs over medium  ones over easy ones over hard  how do they even do that samuel  what  could you please explain these eggs to me  well theres a mommy chicken and a daddy chicken  and when they really love each other  i ordered two eggs over medium  not over soft not over hard not one of each  two eggs over medium you think you can handle that  my apologies  i will bring you two eggs over medium  thank you  now would you like me to spit on them  in the kitchen or would you prefer tableside  i wouldnt push it hes in a mood today  and now thanks to him so am i  excuse me while i go lash out at the dishwasher  for no apparent reason  all right tell me whats wrong cause i know it aint about them eggs  i just want what i ordered  please ive seen you eat a fudgesicle that you dropped in the sand  you call these plates clean  i think molly and i are headed for the skids  what are you talking about i thought you guys were doing great  i thought so too but yesterday it became pretty clear  that im more committed to this relationship than she is  and what makes you think that  i asked her if she wanted to be buried next to me  and she looked at me like i was a crazy person  kind of like the way im looking at you now  all right i admit its a little cart before the horse  but her reaction was a real eyeopener  if shed asked me the same question i wouldnt have flinched  seems like a very twisted way to test a womans commitment  you havent even bought a couch together yet  why does everybody hate my couch  and besides thats moot  you and i already made a pact to have our ashes scattered  along the thirdbase line at wrigley field  when did we agree to do that  two years ago cubs phillies  quarter beer night  you made a turban out of your tshirt  people complained  i have absolutely no memory of that  huh unfortunately the entire bleacher section does  but you do remember our death pact though right  yeah yeah if you go first  i clear all sensitive items out of your bedroom before grandma gets to it  everything questionable disreputable and inflatable  and dont just erase the memory on my laptop  run over it with your car go at it with a welding torch  and throw it into lake michigan  you know you didnt have to come shes my mom and i can take care of her  oh dont be silly  this is part of being a couple  you know supporting the other person when theyre going through something  i appreciate it  you know a lot of people bail when things start to get difficult  but just so you know im not that kind of person  duly noted  mike biggs sticks like glue  through thick or thin  i have no doubt about that  even if you got a bad perm or had to cut off your own arm  in a rockclimbing accident id be right there by your side handinhook  uhhuh  sweetie are you feeling okay  right now im fine  but where would you be if i lost my arm in a rockclimbing accident  well id be living in a parallel world where you had the ability to climb rocks  all right clearly you are not ready to have this conversation  i dont even know what this conversation is  all right i laid my burial dress on the bed  dont bother with the controltop pantyhose or fancy shoes  the good lord already knows i have a paunch and hammertoes  mom quit talking like that youre gonna be fine  oh i put stickers underneath the furniture  with the names of the people it goes to if i kick  the usher at the church with the weird ear  oh and heres jims eyedrops  hes got glaucoma in his right peeper  two drops every six hours  so im im taking care of jim  mikey doesnt have a yard plus he lives above an asian family  now i know they dont all eat dog but why bait the hook  well im more than happy to babysit this little guy  you sure its a pretty big commitment  not at all were gonna have fun arent we jim  dont patronize him it gives him the squirts  feed him twice a day  no chocolate or table scraps  oh and if i should happen to croak  for gods sake dont tell him  hell jump in front of a bus just to be with me in heaven  mrs biggs youre gonna be fine  but if anything does happen  i promise to give jim a happy home for the rest of his life  but if you do change your mind about jim or find a better dog  please call me to come get him and dont put him to sleep  she wouldnt really do that would she  i couldnt tell you mom i dont even know who she is anymore  i think the old one made the big one crazy  come on come on come on come on  come on jim eat your dinner  come on  here why dont you throw some of my spaghetti on top of it  no he cant eat table scraps  but dogs love spaghetti  didnt you see lady and the tramp  maybe just a little bit of sauce  all right jim  ho ho ho weve got a special treat for you  oh yum yum yum yum yum  eat up  smacking lips  he might not be hungry  hes been snacking on his backside for the last hour  why dont take him outside and help him work up an appetite  come on baby  youre going for a walk with auntie victoria  have you heard from mike yet  i tried to call him again at the hospital but hes not answering his phone  everything okay between you two  no hes been acting so strange lately  kind of feels like hes pushing me away  well maybe hes just freaked out about his mama going under the knife  im sure thats part if it but its going to take a lot more  than a bad gallbladder to bring her down  im guessing you have to drop a farmhouse on her  well whatever hes upset about  im sure its not as complicated as you think  men are pretty basic creatures  i know mikes usually not a difficult read  but ive gone through my normal checklist  is him tired is him hungry is him horny  its usually one or the other  hmm dont i know it sometimes its all three  how do you deal with that  climb on top of him with a cookie in your mouth  and wait for him to fall asleep  whoa somebody found their appetite  yeah jim and i had a nice little walk behind the garage  man he makes that dog food look really tasty  okay im going to go home  try to get some sleep youve got a big day tomorrow  wait mikey before you go  i want you to hold on to something for me  your engagement ring  and if i dont pull through  you might think about giving it to that girl of yours someday  well see maybe i hope so  come on  ive seen the way you look at her  i mean shes a little loud and goofy for my taste  has a way of making everything about her  but i wouldnt have left jim with her if i didnt think she was a good person   mom let me ask you something  hmm  if youd have known things were going to go south  between you and dad would you still have married him  you mean if i knew he was going to bust up our little family  to run off with a professional facesquatter  yeah  would you still have built a life with him  if you knew you were going to go through all that pain  i guess so  why  well if i hadnt taken a chance on that dirt bag  i wouldnt have you would i  i love you ma  love you too boy  okay ill be back first thing in the morning  oh and one more thing  if i dont make it through the operation   quit saying that  just in case  have one of the nurses pin this to my gown before they wheel me into the morgue  what youre doing is wrong and youre going to hell  any creep that spends his life working with dead bodies  is not just in it for the money   hey  hey  whats up with jim  hes a little out of it  we danced for a while and then he crashed  i wish i could get some sleep  its been so long since ive slept alone i guess im not used to it anymore  you miss mike huh  yeah the bed just feels so empty without him  well part of that is that hes a very large man  any idea what hes upset about  it started when he asked to be buried next to me  and i didnt know what to say  well thats kind of sweet that hes thinking that far ahead though right  i guess but i cant answer that question honestly  i mean who knows what can happen from one day to the next  true  if you had told me yesterday that id be getting stoned with a dog tonight  id have been very skeptical  but here we are  i love mike but i cant predict the future  and i dont want to make promises to him that i cant keep  well theres nothing wrong with making a promise that you want to keep right  what do you mean  remember when dad died  we were both just kids  but you held me in your arms and said youd take care of me forever  i remember  and youve kept true to that promise so far  have i  all except the part about us being ballerina princesses  living in a chocolate castle  well you never know what tomorrow may bring  right   good night  good night  hey  if you want you can put one of mikes shirts  on my beanbag chair and sleep with that  laughing no  actually that might work  the doctor said everything came off without a hitch  and you can probably go home tomorrow  cant get rid of me fast enough huh  its all about turnover in this slaughterhouse  knocking on door  molly hello  mrs biggs how are you feeling  like a gutted trout how are you this morning  good i brought you some flowers  no candy huh  yeah probably wouldnt survive the drive over  well you seem like youre back to your old feisty self  is there a vase anywhere  use my neighbors water pitcher i think she flatlined last night  or requested to be moved to another room  its nice of you to come by  dont be silly can i talk to you for a second  sure ill be right back  thats what your father said when he went out to get cigarettes 20 years ago  yeah well i dont smoke  neither did he  whats up  look i just  i want you to know that i love you and im not planning on going anywhere  so youre saying when you do dump me itll just be out of the blue  mike stop it  what we have right now is its pretty great  isnt it  its the best  then cant we just concentrate on what we have  and not put so much pressure on the future  you mean live in the moment and appreciate life as it comes along  exactly   yeah im not very good at that  me neither  thats why im trying to take things slow  and not not get ahead of ourselves  im sorry  i guess the idea of losing my mom started me thinking about losing you  and i kind of panicked  youre not gonna lose me   ever  mike  can you at least say at this moment you want to be with me forever  at this moment i want to be with you forever   there now was that so hard  chuckles  not to be a mood breaker but one of you lovebirds  better slide a bedpan underneath my keister  ill wait in the hall  nurse  im gonna need a nurse  oh now we are talking  very stylish  not many straight guys can pull off that look  okay time for jim to go home  oh so soon  i thought he was going to be here a couple more days  well mikes mom is back on her feet and i think she misses him  i get it hes an easy hang  time to say your goodbyes  okay  goodbyejimbo  ive enjoyed our talks  and our walks if you know what i mean  he knows what i mean  just give him here  whoa ooh hes packed on a few pounds hasnt he  yeah little dude likes to munch  oh and tell mrs biggs i dont think  were going to need those eyedrops anymore  i think weve got that glaucoma nipped in the bud  oh great now ive gotta explain to mikes mom  why her dog smells like willie nelsons tour bus  synch by benfo corrections by geirdm
