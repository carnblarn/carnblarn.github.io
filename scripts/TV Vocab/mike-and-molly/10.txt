any baking  no i dont cook much  i work a lot and between school and the shingles i  when mikey was a little boy  i worked fulltime in the school cafeteria  and still managed to put a hot meal on the table  school cafeteria huh  ill bet thats why youre such a good cook  well you pick up a few culinary tricks  when youre stirring goulash with a boat oar  by the way  i bought you a present  really  oh thats really very sweet  i know  ah  its a  hat right  i didnt know your head size but the fellow that worked there  was about your build and it fit him so  i dont know what to say try it on  yeah
