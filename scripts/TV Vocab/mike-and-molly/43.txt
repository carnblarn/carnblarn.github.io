                peggy listen you two  i stuck my neck t so you could get married here  and if your interview with father tim goes south  hell exile me to the back pew  with the smokers and pregnant teens  my stomachs in knots  the last time i had to sit down with father tim i was 12  and he told me id spend eternity in hell  well thats what you get  for cuttin cheese in the confessional booth  turned the lords sacred place of absolution into a dutch oven  id like to believe over the years hed forgotten about it  but ive been in a car with you  just remember hes old school catholic  which means hes up at 600 and drunk by noon  and right now hes either singing danny boy  or taking a swing at a nun  well thats not what jesus would do  they didnt have nuns back then  and this is the guy we want joining us in holy matrimony  just make sure  he knows youre a good catholic  and the two of you arent living together in sin  but im not and we are  please tell me shes not gonna be herself in there  look if you get in a jam just bow your head  and make the sign of the cross  is it leftyloosey or rightytighty   hey there are you mike and molly  yes   yes father  hi im father justin  uh father tim  thank you  father tim is feeling a little under the weather today  overextend himself doing the lords work  or uh knock back too much jamesons  at the monsignors poker game  chuckles actually hes just trying  to throw a few more responsibilities my way  and yes the game did go pretty late last night  well it doesnt matter where the money comes from   when the nunmobile needs new tires  amen  uh shall we get started  exhales lets do it  oh uh actually  this is just for the coupletobe   youll need to wait out here  hang on a second  did father tim tell you who i am  he did and thats why i think it increases their chances  if they go this alone  i understand father  im sure you know what youre doing  ill see you at the church picnic choirboy  ill be the one in the potato sack hoppin right up your ass  for the first time in my life   i see love   and strengthen their hearts  so that they will keep faith with each other  please you in all things and so come to the happiness  celebrating the sacrament of their marriage  we ask this through christ our lord amen  amen  yeah amen  okay the only requirement here today is honesty  uh im gonna ask a few questions  about marriage and family  and there are no wrong answers  just say whats in your heart  are these gonna be churchy kind of questions  cause i really havent been in a long time  she means to this church  weve been going to a different parish closer to our house  oh i see  so you two are living together  no who told you that  look i understand that many couples  choose to live together before getting married  its really more of a financial thing not about sex  i mean ive held out this long right honey  sure  guys theres no need to pretend  that you dont have an intimate relationship  i mabe a m ocloth  but i also have internet access and cinemax  im sorry father  were both just nervous  and have no idea what it is were supposed to say  im just here to make sure you two love each other  and understand what it means to enter into a marriage  oh yeah she really hammered home  all that compromising and listening crap  stuff father  amen  i just need to confirm  a couple of things  uh your commitment to the church  and that youre planning on raising your children catholic  can do and will do see you at the wedding padre  well hang on a second  we havent really discussed raising our kids catholic  molly quit jokin around  of course were going to raise them catholic  church every sunday  and the rest of the week guilt shame penance and bingo  mike mike mike  he wants us to be honest  i mean father we can promise you  that well raise our children with a strong set of values  good to hear  but come on we cant guarantee you  what path theyre gonna take  or that theyre gonna go to church every sunday  well not every sunday  i mean if little patrick or mary teresa has the sniffles  well do like a home worship kinda thing  and dont worry well make it long and boring  just like a regular mass  so what i hear you saying  is that you are not a practicing catholic  and have no intention of raising your children that way  no i am a practicing catholic  i just miss a lot of practices  laughing  well unfortunately those are two of the major requirements  when getting married in a catholic church  i dont think i should force religion on my children  dont we want that to be their choice  laughs nervously get a load of her  kids makin their own choices  whats next dogs flying airplanes  im sorry  but we have certain requirements  we have weddings here for our parishioners which you are not  we were willing to make an exception  because frankly were all pretty scared of your mother  speaking of which mom said itd be a good idea  to grease gods wheel  and now a cop is bribing a priest  i think were done here  hang on a second  are you not gonna marry us because i cant guarantee you  the souls of our unborn children  forgive her father shes possessed  if you can spin your head around  now would be the time to do it  how the hell did you lose the church  did you take a whore bath in the holy water  he told us to be honest  sighs do you know how many acts of christian charity  im gonna have to do to work my way  back to the front of the sanctuary  this is not my fault  well its your name ill be cursing every saturday  while im spooning out beefaroni to a pack of smelly hobos  what was i supposed to do  just sit there and lie to a prit  thats exactly what you do  you say you covet your neighbors new leaf blower  not that you want to clean his colon with it  every good catholic knows that  i cant believe this  one month before the wedding and we lose the church  and theres no other places available  oh the senior center said we can get married there  good news they have a dance floor  bad news lots of people have died on it  i got a buddy whod let you use his warehouse  beautiful space  if you can tolerate nearfreezing temperatures  and a few pig carcasses  oh good that covers old and rotting  now i just need something borrowed and blue  hey dont get mad at me  just cause you got lippy with a priest  yeah sweetie you got to be careful with that bunch  they cant have sex with women  so they got to find another way to stick it to you  i didnt do anything wrong  thou shalt not tell a lie and i didnt  no i think youre thinking of george washington honey  the bibles chockfull of little fibs and outandout bs  yeah i mean a guy gete  and lives to tell about it  i dont think so  vin youre confusing the bible with pinocchio again  which one had the talking cricket  im going out for a beer  ill be back in a while  what are you talking about  you need to help me find us a place to get married  hey how about the church i grew up in  oh wait you kinda blew that for us didnt you  mike what happened happened  it didnt have to happen if youd just followed my lead  maybe if you talked a little less and listened a little more  we wouldnt be in this mess  really  okay nightynight kids sleep tight  look i dont want to have a big fight  oh it is too late for that  so youre saying you want me to just smile  and keep my trap shut  thats not what i said  yeah but thats what youre thinking isnt it  yes but i have the good sense not to say it  you see how easy it is  molly and i had a fight  well this is your home and youre always welcome  you have to sleep on the couch though  i gave your old room to jim  ill have a denver omelet with buttered toast  and a glass of oj  water and alkaseltzer for me  oh a nasty food hangover huh  may i recommend a little hair of the 12 hot dogs that bit you  for your information i did not have one single hot dog  he had two tubes of cookie dough one cooked and one not  and two chicken pot pies also one cooked and one not  why do i even tell you this stuff  you didnt i guessed it by the smell of your burps  fyi the walkin freezer has a padlock and a security camera  dont embarrass yourself  so youre telling me the wedding is off now  no we just have to find a new place to have it  and theres a 5050 chance that i wont even be invited  well im just asking  cause you know how tight my schedule is  thats the first thing i thought of  when my life fell apart  will carl have to reschedule his fantasy baseball draft  no you cant reschedule the draft  thats my point  i didnt even want a big church wedding  but she did so i went along with it  cause im a getalong guy like most men are  know why you never hear the phrase getalong girl  cause theres never been one  they have to let everybody know what theyre thinking  they get a bad haircut  the whole world has to know about it  me i just let you make fun of me till it grows out  nah i know what you mean  christinas also very vocal  the other day she had to call out some guy  in the nineitemsorless aisle  why cant they just let that go  especially when the offending shopper is a big biker  with crazy eyes and 14 boxes of sudafed  you know what molly does hmm  she shushes people at the movies  oh no shes one of those yeah  the other night there was this young couple in front of us  and the woman was yammering on about something  just tell me this were they black  well thats not the point of the story carl  but yes of course they were black  damn  i try to lead by example but my people simply will not follow  anyway molly starts in with sh  uhoh yeah then she leans in with a do you mind  which translates to hey wanna punch my fat boyfriend  mmm so how did it end  i had a grape soda tossed at my face by woman named shaniqua  still better than having a methhead biker  make fun of your tiny ears and your hemorrhoid cream  by the way if christina ever asks you have hemorrhoids  did mike call  no oh  but my pot dealer did  he said if you want to  you can have your wedding in his basement grow room  well at least the lighting will be good  put a pin in that on the off chance  that we do actually get married  oh come on moll this is just prewedding jitters  you and mike love each other  youre gonna work it out  im not gonna apologize for being an opinionated person  its who i am and its not gonna change   certainly hasnt so far  hey  and thats good  yeah damn right its good  i deserve a man who appreciates me for who i am  straightshootin molly flynn  sassy brassy kiss my assy  exactly  if he wants some little quiet wallflower  to cook him dinner and laugh at his jokes  he can go look somewhere else for that  you cant put baby in a corner  no you cannot  and if you try to do it babys gonna bite  so what are you gonna do call off the wedding  no youre gonna call your pot dealer  im gonna call the bakery  and have them turn a wedding cake into a thousand cupcakes  listen hes my son and hes only gonna be here a few days  youre still my favorite so quit crapping on the bath mat  dont pretend it wasnt you  im old but i can still clutch my mud  hey mom barks  what did i just say  how was your day boy  fine did molly call  no she didnt  and youre not gonna call her  cause you got nothing to apologize for  i dont know i might have overreacted a little  hey nothing wrong with standing up for yourself  you dont want to walk into a marriage  crawling around on all fours barks  are we gonna go nosetonose all night  something smells good  made your favorite  tuna noodle casserole  with two cans of pringles crumbled on top  one regular one cool ranch  and you cooked it so the noodles got a little crunchy  just the way you like it  i also made a batch of chocolate peanut butter brownies  well put on the feed bag and watch that show  about the two girls and a horse  sounds good  what are you doing  just checking my phone messages  boy shes really got you by the skin pickle doesnt she  know what mom you need to back off  all im saying is if youre really gonna marry this woman  she needs to know whos boss  i dont want to be her boss i want to be her husband  what youre acting like is her damn lapdog  barks  not everything is about you  can we just eat  i dont know why dont you call your fiancee  and ask her if youre hungry  all right mom you are treading on very thin ice  i didnt raise you to spend your life getting browbeaten  by some loudmouth harpy  at some point youre gonna have to grow a pair  and say enough is enough  you know what mom youre right  enough is enough  im sick of you butting into my life  and badmouthing the woman i love  and if you keep it up you and i are gonna have a real problem  you cant get along with anybody can you  dont start with me carl  im not in the mood  you better be nice to me  youre running out of houses  mmm i will say this about your mom  for an old crusty woman  she sure makes a moist achewy brownie  you think i chose her house first  cause shes so fun to be around  look man youre welcome to stay here but eventually  you and molly are gonna have to talk this thing out  yeah i know  see communication is the glue  that holds a relationship together  that and staying out of the bathroom  when she shaves her legs or makes a boomboom  michael please tell me youre not trusting  the delicate machinations of your relationship  to this talking donkey  excuse me  i am in a committed relationship now  and think i have some valuable insight  into the malefemale dynamic  boy just cause you got a ride on the lucky bus dont mean  you should be teaching other people how to drive  im gonna get some milk  well use a glass this time  cause if i hear that milk jug crinkle from you sucking on it  im going buster douglas on the side of your head  thanks for letting me stay here tonight nana  oh youre welcome here anytime michael  but i hate to think of that pretty little girl of yours  fretting and worrying about you  i dont want to hurt her  im just afraid that were too different  well different is good  yeah but shes got to have an opinion about everything  if she sees something wrong  she got to say something about it  and what would you prefer her to do  sit back smile and pretend like everythings okay  thats what i do  and thats what you were doing before you met her  sitting in that sad little apartment  pretending everything was okay  god i was a mess  and if that woman had just shut up and left well enough alone  youd still be a mess  standing in your kitchen  drinking milk right out of the jug like i told you not to  damn old woman you got ears like a bat  mm  youve got a good strong woman there  and you dont love her in spite of what she is  you love her because of what she is  chuckles  i better get home and help molly  find a place for us to have our wedding  well if you need a church the first baptist  is always happy to open its doors to a young couple  really  as long as your check clears  and you keep your drinking to the parking lot  no problem  mollys mom can drink anywhere  laughs  that was really nice of you grandma  well him i can fix  youre like a bad rash that always needs gas money  were out of milk  just make me so mad i could just  sweetie i want to apologize again  for the way i spoke to you  im sorry for telling you not to let the door  hit you in the butt on the way out  you actually said ass  do we want to replay the game tapes  no maam we do not  but dont worry  i promise this time ill let you do most of the talking  hey your honest assertive nature is what i love about you  and what makes us a great team  thanks sweetie  but just to be on the safe side  i should probably take the lead on this  good morning morning  morning  so sister rosetta tells me  that you two would like to get married in our sanctuary  are either one of you baptist  uh  were not  but if its a dealbreaker  take me to the river and dunk me in the water  laughs  well that wont be necessary  the only requirement here is you have faith in god  and a 1200 check made out to cash  so we dont have to pretend to be baptist  or black or  well you can if you want its your wedding  chuckles  and if you are gonna pretend to be black youll want our choir  and thats an extra 400  amen brother  hallelujah  you know i had a greatgreat grandmother  that was halfblack halfcherokee  really  no i dont know why i just said that  i should just shut up
