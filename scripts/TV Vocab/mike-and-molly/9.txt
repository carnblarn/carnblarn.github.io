anniversary  or special occasion i was supposed to remember  no no occasion  its just a little something i saw that screamed mike  oh what a coincidence  i saw something last night that screamed mike  three times  just open it  oh boy cowboy boots  oh how did you know  well you told me that story  about the boots you had when you were little  and how you stopped wearing them  when all the other boys made fun of you  yeah you get called belly the kid enough  it sours you on western footwear  cant believe you remembered that story  of course i remembered  just like you remember the stories i tell you  right  dont worry im not going to quiz you  thank you  they should fit  i took one of your shoes to the boot store  to make sure i got the right size  smart that way you didnt have to pour plaster  into one of my footprints  oh my god these are amazing  oh is that real rattlesnake   can you imagine how many snakes had to die  for those things hey screw them  better on my feet than biting people and swallowing eggs  well you look very handsome in them cowboy  yeah they do kind of work on me dont they  i dont know how to thank you  well i got a couple ideas if youre interested partner  id be mighty happy to oblige maam  just let me pull my boots off  no no leave the boots on  but take off everything else   for the first time in my life    i see love    you know those cowboy boots arent regulation police wear  neither is the leopardprint thong  youre wearing underneath your uniform  first of all its not a thong its a jock strap  and its not leopard print its camouflage  that must come in handy  when you need to hide your junk in someones salad  what do you want  whoa is that how you greet paying customers  oh so youre paying now  figure of speech  whats the matter with you this morning  two busboys and a waiter called in sick  so i had to walk here in the freezing rain  because my bicycle was stolen  you want us to file a report we might be able to find it  if youre going to play detective  id prefer you find my car  which was stolen a year ago and the reason  im riding a bicycle in the first place  well have two breakfast specials  youll have whatever i bring you and youll like it  yes we will  so why did molly buy you those boots anyway  you guys have an anniversary or something  no thats the beauty of it  she bought them just cause she was thinking about me  huh its kind of like that puka shell necklace  i got you in fort lauderdale that you never wear  sorry im not a puka shell kind of guy  who doesnt like puka shells  everybody  except you aquaman and don ho  my point is though  ive never gotten this kind of attention from a woman before  it makes me feel kind of i dont know sexy  now you know how i feel about my camo jock  its like having rambo in my pants  oatmeal or pudding  ill have the oatmeal  dont go in there  that tunnel is just painted on  beepbeep  why dont you ever listen to me  sweetheart you shouldnt get so involved in that show  yeah im starting to think that dog  is never going to catch that chicken  where you going  mm mikes picking me up  and were going to go to an oa meeting  how did he like the cowboy boots  it was so cute  his whole face lit up like a little boys  so you guys are getting pretty serious huh  i think so  i mean i dont want to jinx it  but uh i think were headed towards a really good place  oh i love this stage in a relationship  when youre just getting comfortable with each other  and nobodys gotten a restraining order  or asked you to have a threeway with their cleaning lady  yeah its a magical time  hey moonface how are you  what are you doing here vince  im taking your mom out for a nice dinner  and for one of those carriage rides along the lake  its kind of romantic if you dont mind  the smell of hot steaming horse crap  wait a second youre dating my mother  hey old soups still good if you heat it up  mom  come on in i guess  but stay close to the door  no problem  hey there she is  the reason god created tube tops and hands  you want to go wait on the porch  hey vin  well youre looking very handsome this evening  thanks i had some fat sucked out of my neck waddle  well its nice  it really separates your shoulders from your head  hey we should probably shake a tail feather  the buffet already started and after about an hour  the calamari starts looking like deepfried anuses  i know hes not your father but he treats me like a queen  and you can crack walnuts on his johnson  lets never eat walnuts around him  deal  i got to tell you folks  things have been going pretty well for me  my job my personal life  and as a result my attitudes better  im losing weight without even thinking about it  get this last tuesday i forgot to eat lunch  crazy right that never happens  ive forgotten ive eaten lunch on a number of occasions  so i had to eat again just in case  but this is monumental  i have forgotten to take the gas nozzle out of my car  i have forgot my gun was loaded  but i have never forgotten lunch  anyway long story short youre looking  at a happy confident slightly smaller man  than you saw in here one week ago  win the battle here win the battle here  no glory no guts  happy trails mi amigos  you were pretty cute up there tonight  no youre just saying that cause youre sweet on me  both can be true  hey you want to go upstairs and make out in the confessional  absolutely  its been almost a week since my last confession  hi hello  i just wanted to say  that i really loved your share  oh thank you  im jill  mike i know  i love your boots  i just moved here from texas  so im kind of a sucker for a man in cowboy boots  oh this is molly shes a friend of mine  hi im molly mikes friend  nice to meet you  nice to meet you  listen i dont have a sponsor yet  and id love for it to be you  really wow  nobodys ever asked me to be their sponsor before  let me give you my number  great  i dont have a pen  seriously  sure what are friends for  you going to tell me whats wrong  or do i have to guess  i bet if you thought really hard about it  you could figure it out friend  wait thats what youre mad about  because i introduced you as my friend  yeah mike thats what im so mad about  so what are you saying that were not friends  that this whole thing is just sex for you  because its more than that for me oh no  dont you dare turn this around  you know exactly what you did  she asked me to be her sponsor  i mean just because shes pretty  im not supposed to help her  not that i think shes pretty  you flirted with her plain and simple  why dont you just come out and admit it  i did not flirt with her  now she may have been flirting with me  but i cant control that  in a way isnt that a compliment to you  do you two want me to leave  yes no  okay ill stay but ill cover my eyes  should we go upstairs and talk about this  i dont think theres anything to talk about  so what then should i just leave  well im sure you could go find  some of your friends to hang out with  right  those boots really do look cute on him  i know they do  oh  oh baby you are nasty  do what okay hang on  all right im on my hands and knees  what bark like a dog  is this the busty asians chatline  oh damn i dialed wrong  some sick people out there  uh you need to call before you come by  ive been trying to call for the last 45 minutes  no really  whats 299 times 45  what why  never mind come on in  thought you were going out with molly tonight  i did we got in a fight  about what  some girl at an oa meeting came up and flirted with me  and molly got all bent out of shape  wait you had another woman hit on you at an oa meeting  man i need to pack on 80 pounds  and get my fat ass to a church basement  what was the other girl like  was she cute  yeah if you like dirty blondes from texas  i like dirty anything from anywhere  what am i supposed to do  i mean she approached me  i hear you man  i mean its not like you took her phone number or anything  she used mollys pen to write it down  man what is wrong with you  i dont know  now let me ask you a question yeah  how big is this dirty girl  we talking texas toast or just texas  molly why dont you just call him  no he needs to call me and apologize  what is the big deal  all guys flirt  if they didnt wed have to buy our own drinks  and pay for our own speeding tickets  and dry cleaning and tires  and this dinette set  its not just the flirting  its that he couldnt acknowledge  that i was his girlfriend in public  oh mol that happens to me all the time  course the guys usually married  or a highranking public official  you know ive been in two motorcades  once in the trunk and once under the dashboard  i just thought mike was different  you know he was so shy when i met him  and now hes strutting around impressing slutty blondes  with his heroic stories of skipping lunch  you really should cut the guy some slack  i know he cares about you  he cares about me cause i have sex with him  and every 25th time he gets a free pair of boots  do we have anything stronger than this  well theres a bottle of vodka in the freezer  or theres a spliff of purple kush in my hand  guess it was kind of stupid of me  to introduce her as my friend  man you were looking up at stupid with a telescope  but your instincts were correct  how so well its not  in a mans nature to settle down with one woman  were supposed to propagate with multiple partners  like they do in the animal kingdom  what about swans  i heard they mate for life  who can confirm that  is there some guy following them around all day long  cause if there was im sure hed see that swan  playing a little duck duck goose every now and then  hey michael how are you baby  im all right nana  how was choir practice  well the new music director is young and full of beans  i had to pull him aside and tell him  brother the lord dont need it fancy he just needs it loud  so what are you doing here on a friday night  dont you have a girlfriend  im not sure at the moment  oh what did you do  why do you immediately assume it was me  im an old woman michael  dont waste my time  another girl flirted with me  how is that my fault  its not  you were just behaving like a natural man  i see  and does a natural man tuck his business between his legs  and dance in front of the bathroom mirror  grandma i was 13 years old  worst thing i ever saw  wanted to take a stick and blind myself  now michael did you flirt back  not intentionally but i was kind of in a zone  every time i opened my mouth something charming fell out  hmm you dont seem to have that problem now  tell me are you interested in this other woman  no of course not nana  i dont want other women  mollys it for me  shes my girlfriend and i love her  what did you say  i love her  im done looking  mollys my swan  i dont want to play duck duck goose with anybody but her  duck duck what  i dont know ask friar tuck  i got to go  thanks nana  im so happy for you baby  me too  carlton i hope one day you meet the right girl  fall in love and find the kind of happiness  your friend has found  thanks  but until then i guess youre just gonna  have to make do with the love of your old grandma  well i could do a lot worse  mmhmm  and you have  so i guess it is kind of funny  i put makeup on dead people for a living  how do you do it  i mean its weird right  its got to be weird  it was at first  but then i realized  dead people are just like us  except theyre dead  i couldnt do it  id be too afraid that their eyes would pop open  and theyd try to eat my flesh  doesnt happen as often as youd think  mainly i just get complaints from family members  i cant tell you how many times ive heard someone say  hey you made grandma look like a whore  cookies  i ever tell you about the time i went over to mikes  and baked him that sugarless nonfat nondairy cookies  oh that sounds awful  they were they tasted like hot dust bunnies  you know what he said what  he said wow these cookies really suck  and then he ate four more  god i love that man  did you just hear what you said  what did i just say  you said you loved him  when did i say that just now  really  really  son of a gun  hot hot hot hot  whats going on  whatever it is dont stop em  mollys in love  oh sweetie is that true  uhhuh  oh im so happy for you  good times ladies  good good times  ill get it  no reason the three of us  cant prolong this precious moment  what are you doing here  i had to tell you something  what  first of all  im sorry i flirted with that other girl  i didnt initiate it  but i also didnt stop it and that was wrong  well im sorry too  i shouldnt have made such a big deal about it  hey you had every right to be upset  youre my girlfriend and thats how i shouldve introduced you  okay so im still your girlfriend  of course you are  and i love  my new boots  seriously i dont know what id do without them  well im glad you like them  no you didnt hear me  i love them  i love them too  taste like toll house cookies and marijuana  well you shouldnt leave me alone on a friday night  itll never happen again  so thats the makeup sex ive been hearing about  seems like you were a little madder than you let on  well im not gonna lie  a couple of those scratches were for real pal  maybe i should flirt with other women more often  joke joke joke joke joke  we should probably go to sleep before you piss me off again  thats a very good idea  good night molly  good night mike  are you really gonna sleep in those things  what can i tell you they make me happy
