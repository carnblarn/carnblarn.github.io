how long should i wait before asking her out  fans cheering  carlton what are you doing home  just hanging out watching some football  no you aint  brother heywoods on his way over here  with a deck of cards and a bottle of tawny port  dont worry i wont interfere with your card game  aint nobody playing cards fool  thats why i need your narrow butt  off the couch and out of my house  ill just go to my room and put my headphones on  brother heywoods been out of town for six weeks  you need to go to the garage and turn on the leaf blower  why dont you go spend some time with christina  sighs  i dont think thats an option anymore grandma  oh no what kind of nasty freaky perversion  you try and talk that sweet innocent girl into  its not about that  she wanted me to spend the night with her but i couldnt do it  i told you if you kept playing with yourself  you wouldnt be able to play with others  hey my equipment is fine  its just i dont need to be getting involved with some woman  whos already got a kid  why cause you think you can do better than her  no because i think she can do  better than me  oh baby of course she can  but if she aint saying it out loud  dont you be putting it in her head  i mean what do i know about being somebodys daddy  i never knew my own father and i barely remember my mom  hold on is she asking you to be this boys daddy  no but  stop thinking  you aint good at it so dont even try  but if  what did i just say to you  grandma the womans got plenty to deal with raising  a sixyearold son without me complicating things  well i sure know what thats like  you were about that age when you came here  to live with me  lord you were a sullen moody child  the only time you ever smiled was on  those rare occasions when your mama called  i dont recollect any of that  well aint for lack of memory because shoot  you used to be able to recite  every episode of dukes of hazzard  and dr kings i have a dream speech  oh yeah i remember doing that  i loved seeing you  emulate the good doctor  but that other mess was just hillbilly gibberish  maybe some things are less painful to remember  i suppose so  but i sure am thankful for the way things played out  cause if you hadnt come here to live with me  id have missed out on some of my  my most precious memories  thank you grandma  now as much as i love having you in my life  i need you to get out of my house  right  mimics dr king five score years ago a great american  in whose symbolic shadow we stand today  signed the emancipation proclamation  time and place boy time and place  good night grandma  sighs  what are you doing here carl  look i understand if you dont want to talk  but i just need a chance to explain myself not interested  please just give me a minute  you got one minute  ok first of all im sorry i ran off  at was a stupid thing to do  no answering this door was stupid  what you did was selfish inconsiderate and cowardly  no argument  quick question when you talk  is that time taken out of my minute   when i was six years old my mom ran off and left me  with my grandma which may have caused abandonment issues  which have not been dealt with properly  at all really and then when i saw you singing  to your little boy like an angel might i add  it brought up those aforementioned issues  and im afraid i reacted poorly  you still got five seconds  im sorry im sorry im sorry im sorry  so youre telling me a 35year old man  never been married lives with his grandma has issues   you see right through me dont you  from day one  and i still stuck around  so youre clearly not the only one  on this porch with problems  you know problems have been known to go away  yeah ive heard that  but my sons here now so i cant ask you in  i understand  maybe some other time  maybe i already gone a year a half  so im in no rush  a year and a half damn  damn is right youd still be trying  to put your eyeballs back in ur head  well youre killing me girl  thats the idea  all right we got about three more hours  before they come back from indiana  god willing  should we start here work our way up  or start upstairs and work our way down  ooh we could do it in my sisters beanbag chair  no it makes weird enough noises when  you sit on it wearing pants  got a crazy idea  how about our bed  youre a dirty girl hey  doorbell rings  oh are you kidding  i know you were worried so i wanted to come by  and tell you everything is fine and we talked  should i wait out here till youre done  both no  for addic7edcom
