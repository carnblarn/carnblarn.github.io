of toast at the house  was it being used as a coaster for a honeybaked ham  and you cant tell me youre not hungry  your stomachs been growling all morning  it sounded like a grizzly bear  opening the door to a haunted house  ill keep a short stack at the ready  in case gentle ben comes out of hibernation  hey im just eating light  so that on thanksgiving i can have a little extra stuffing  and maybe some dessert  and there it is the first lie of the holiday season  god bless us everyone  let it go okay  fine im not gonna push it  oh by the way im bringing christina  with me and grandma this

having to buy new ones  well it didnt take a magic eight ball  to know you were gonna put those pounds back on  and come aknocking for your chubby duds  its just temporary  ill drop this weight before molly finds out about it  is that why youre starving yourself  so she can parade you around in tank tops and skinny jeans  mom my skinny jeans have  and my tank tops are tank tops  i for one love you for who you are  unlike your fiance who seems hellbent  on turning you into a chippendale dancer  mom people have actually offered me money  to keep my clothes on  and dont talk about molly that way  she only wants whats best for me  all right dont bite my head off  sounds to me like somebodys got  a bad case of the hungrygrumblies  youd be grumbly too  if you were living on dry toast and lemon wedges  oh my god that awful woman is killing you  how bout mommy makes you a nice bowl  of macaroni and cheese while you put on your big boy itches  probably wouldnt hurt for me to have a little something  ill slice up a few wienies in it  that way youre getting your protein  thanks mom  dont judge me ive seen you eat cat poop  barks  you guys are gonna love these mashed potatoes  its a new recipe  that i found in my healthy living cookbook  mmm all right oop  amazing  mmm sweetie these are delicious  and heres the kicker theyre not really mashed potatoes  theyre pureed cauliflower  yech blech  oh come on a second ago you loved it  a second ago it was potatoes  you tricked us  i dont like that  sorry im late my mom needed me to unclog her disposal  and the thing blew coffee grounds all over me  which is why im wearing this shirt youve never seen before  well dinners almost ready  actually im not hungry i had a late lunch  a late light sensible lunch  not hungry ive heard him say not  and ive heard him say hungry  never the two together  you dont think hes getting fed  somewhere else do you stop it  like that big ol maine coon cat we used to have buster  hed come home late and walk right past his food dish  thats right the divorce up the street was  giving him fancy feast rubbing his belly  and calling him rodney mmhmm  i dont think  and she wasnt the only one  we had to tie a little bell around his neck  so wed know where he was  and hed always come home just to sleep and go potty  thats how i knew  he was eating three dinners a day  his litter box started looking like an ashtray  at a cuban card game  harry you gotta help me  i just ate two bowls of mac and cheese at my moms  what does it matter if its the packaged kind  what matters is i ate it  right out of the pot with my bare hands  mike oh  who you talking to  nobody just uh checking my voicemail  seeing if anybody called  how are you  im good everything okay  yep never better  phone ringing  are ya gonna answer that  yes i am i just didnt want to be rude  cheery hello  hey harry whats up my man  oh no thats horrible  ill be right over  apparently hes crawled into a bag of oreos  and hes trying to eat his way out  im surprised he got reception in there  oreos the doublestuffed train to hell  i may actually have to put a bell around his neck  listen you dont have to worry about molly finding out  this is a mens only group  harry im not ready to share  im still burping up wienies and cheese  oh man do i miss those burps  but weve got to get you back on the road to recovery  all right lets do this thing  just remember the first step is  to be honest with yourself  so you can be honest with everybody else  and its even more challenging  being a gay man with weight issues  by the way my name is kevin youre ronaldo  and were very much in love  our primary purpose is  to abstain from compulsive overeating  and to carry this message of recovery  to those who still suffer  harry im gonna be fine lets just get out of here  all you have to do is stand up  pretend to be gay and admit that youre powerless over food  and my beautiful brown eyes  fine ill go first  you have a very commanding presence  hello my name is kevin and im an overeater  all hi kevin  well things are going really super for me  ronaldo and i are very happy  and gay  we both have weight issues  and occasionally we stumble  but there is no judgment  our relationship is based on honesty  it is the glue that holds us together  that and our adopted african son chadwick  applause  i didnt want kids  but kevin up there really wanted to be a mommy  i apologize for bringing up chadwick  but i had to make it believable  because of my palpable hetero vibe  fine  and im sorry i didnt share tonight  but ill be back on my diet first thing in the morning  why are you pulling into a drivethru  im gonna grab a diet coke you want anything  no i dont and neither do you  im just getting something to drink  oh the siren smell of fries its like a salty whorehouse  could i get a diet coke please  you sure you dont want anything no mike  please get us out of this  godforsaken island of temptation  are those chicken tenders made with white meat  slippery slope slippery slope  you know what strike that  how about a grilled chicken sandwich  and a small order of fries  do not give this man food  stop it  no chicken sandwich no coke no fries  man one chicken sandwich one coke one fries  no  its out of my hands  i will not be party to this on second thought  forget the chicken sandwich  ill have a double bacon cheeseburger  you shall not pass  pay at the first window please  i dont think i want to be your sponsor anymore  so what time did mike finally get home last night  i dont know it was late  and i was already asleep just snuck in huh  thats what buster would do  okay stop it  mikes not a cat hes also not cheating on me  he is however cheating on his diet  and hes trying to hide it from me  that explains why ive been finding  candy wrappers in my bird feeder  oh no its gotten that bad  well its either him  or the finches are feeding their babies milk duds  and i didnt want to say anything but my munchie drawer  has definitely been compromised  victoria are you sure it was mike pretty sure  my cheetos were gone and the tv remote was orange  and tasted like cheese  you know i was very instrumental  in getting mike and molly together  i didnt realize you were such a romantic carl  oh yes i may have a tough rugged exterior  but inside im like two baby ducks  giving each other butterfly kisses  ring the bell fool  this pie is hot and my behind is cold  when he starts rambling on like that just sing a song in your head  thats what i do  doorbell ringing  dont worry vince ill get it  how long till we eat  well if you hopped in the oven  with an apple in your mouth id say four hours  hey happy thanksgiving hi happy thanksgiving  molly id like you to meet my special lady christina  christina this is molly  its so nice to finally meet you  nice to meet you too  hi nana hey sweetie  wheres mike  oh hes been upstairs all morning  oh yeah the diet thing you want me to talk to him  would you ii dont think hes ready to talk to me  oh yeah itll be fine ill be right back  and if that old woman starts to tell christina the story  about me and the blind girl at bible camp  knock the drink out her hand and come get me will do  right after i hear the story  come on in  oh no hawaiian shirt and sweatpants  why dont you just put on a muumuu and be done with it  its not a big deal its supposed to be a casual gathering  yeah but we aint playing ukuleles and juggling fire sticks  all right i may have put on a couple of pounds  but trust me friday morning im back in the saddle  the way youre going by friday morning  youre gonna be wearing a saddle  carl please dont tell molly  she lost three pounds last week and all i lost  was a nutter butter i dropped in the shower  eating in the shower again  but i thought things were going so good  ive never been happier in my life  and because of that  i think i may have let my guard down a little  so you put on a few pounds and that made you feel guilty  which caused you to eat more  exactly next thing you know im hiding snack cakes  in my gym shoes and dressing like don hobo  wait you actually went out and bought gym shoes  hey thats good cardio in and of itself  carl bible camp  gotta go  hey nice outfit  you want to borrow my coconut bra  theres something i need to tell you  have a seat  hope youre not seeing another woman  because we dont have any more chairs downstairs  im not having an affair  but i have been sneaking around and hiding something from you  youve fallen off your diet  you know  of course i know  i spend every day with you i sleep with you  i put my arms around you  and you figured out your arms arent getting any shorter  no  im sorry to disappoint you  mike the only thing that disappointed me  was that you didnt feel that you could come talk to me about it  i didnt want you to think i was weak  and especially since youre doing so good  yeah for now  but just last month i ate a whole bag of my sisters cheetos  while i was watching the chicago marathon  she really needs to put a lock on that munchie drawer  she really needs to quit smoking pot  you know one of the perks of this whole relationship thing  is that you get to tell the other person everything  you want to hear the best part  what  they never stop loving you  listen everyone mike and i are going to go out for a little while  just enjoy yourselves  when the oven dings take the turkey out  based on this group thats probably gonna fall on you  got it  and dont worry about saving anything for me  ive been a little remiss in my diet  oh and harry  the secrets out i told her everything  did you tell her about our baby chadwick  and the room full of gay men  ill explain it in the car oh  where are you two going  were going to an oa meeting  its thanksgiving  yeah well ive been celebrating the holiday for a while now  hey you want to take some banana pudding  for the drive over  wow really
