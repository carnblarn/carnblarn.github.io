four hour cruise on lake michigan  sure  the only thing people like more than sitting through a wedding  is being trapped at sea with a boatload of drunk cousins  yeah it shifts from a cocktail party to a hostage situation  in about an appletini and a half  what about just having a traditional church wedding  well mikes mom would love it if we got married in a church  so we wont be doing that  i did a good job with you girls  im telling you they dont make engines like that anymore  exactly  so its gonna cost me an arm and a leg  for any replacement parts  and that should factor into your asking price  youre not really considering buying that car are you  relax im not going to drop eight grand on a used car  you mean the used car youve been dry humping  for the last hour  i was tryin to get comfortable in the seat  you unbuckled your pants  thats how i get comfortable  fine eight grand  vince youre not going to sell that car to mike for 8000  thank you mom  we could get ten from a stranger  ten  you already said eight  how about what i said  did you say something  you know what do what you want  but try and talk him down to 7000  so you have enough left over to buy sex on the honeymoon  you heard the lady  7000  yeah the engine looks clean  whats he asking for it  8000  thats a good price  and look at this back seat  its practically a hideabed  oh yeah you put in a toilet and a hot plate  and its an efficiency apartment  what kind of gas mileage does it get  only about six miles to the gallon  but its got a 30gallon tank  nice  so almost 200 miles between fillups  yeah thats pretty much what im getting with the galant now  but with none of the roominess or pizzazz  oh yeah youre up to your nips in pizzazz  what kind of safety features  its got a horn and ive got an airbag  oh my lord  the 1957 chevrolet bel air  michael is this your car  thinking about it  ooh i had me some good times in the back of a bel air  i lost something in one of these i aint never getting back  im going to pretend shes talking about  her high school ring  id just turned 17 and had never been with a boy  you know because my momma was so strict  grandma please i dont need to be hearing all that mess  you and molly are going to look great  riding around in this thing  just tell her not to wear her high heels in the back seat  shell puncture this upholstery  and rip holes in the roof lining  grandma  to tell the truth  i dont think mollys too keen on me buying this thing  and we do have a wedding to pay for  well she got an engagement ring  why cant you get something shiny  he was the handsomest boy in our church  it was his daddys car  and i remember  if i had a hammer was playin on the radio  and he did  grandma seriously thats not for my ears  im just saying this might be the last chance you get  to do something nice for yourself  youre right  i mean if im not happy how am i ever gonna make her happy  tug on her hair and stick a tongue in her ear  if i had a hammer   id hammer in the morning   id hammer in the evening all over this land   id hammer all the danger   how come you get dessert and i dont  because for breakfast i had cottage cheese and fruit  and you had a fried egg on a poptart  listen if i promise to budget my points better tomorrow  can i have a bite  sorry pal  youve been playing with the houses money  for about two days now  youre telling me you didnt have anything to eat  when you were at carls  no i just showed him the car thats all  by the way he thought it was a steal at that price  well maybe he should buy it  carl would look like an idiot in that car  besides his dream car is the scoobydoo mystery machine  hes a child  be that as it may  i just dont think its a practical purchase right now  that car is an investment  it originally sold for 2000  it has appreciated 400  in my mind were driving around in our kids college fund  my thoughts exactly  listen you cant decide anything  until you take a ride in it  and if you dont fall in love with it the way i did  ill let it go  all right fine  but were stopping by to get some frozen yogurt  because i still have five points left  thats impossible  i want to see your score card  youre shavin points somewhere  no im just not having secret picnics by the garbage cans  im telling you well get a lot of use out of this car  you know how youre always telling me what a big load i am on the weekends  well in this baby im a load on the road  so its basically just a couch that moves  oh it moves all right  can your couch do this  engine revs  oh my god this thing is a rocket  i told you  wed have a blast in this car  im not saying its not cool  i just dont think its very practical  itll be our vacation car  we could take weekend road trips in it  well it would be fun to get out of the house  maybe drive down route 66  we could take it all the way to the grand canyon  can i drive it no  i mean yeah yeah you can drive it  but theres no power steering  and youve really got to stand on the brakes  so id never get to drive it  what  who said that  nobody said that  this is our car  i was just giving you a little headsup about how she handles  well just pull over and let me drive  okay but im warning you its big its loud  and the tailpipe backfires  ill be fine i sleep with you every night  chuckles happily  well maybe we can swing this  you know if we dont eat out as much  and we could scale back on the wedding  now youre talking  i mean we dont have to release all those doves  for our first kiss  carls got an uncle that raises pigeons  its not like the audubon societys gonna be there  hey give that horn a honk  honks  laughs  cool right  yeah its pretty cool  okay if were going to really do this lets have a plan  lets hit vince with good copbad cop  and i bet we can get him down to seven grand  well youre close  i got him down to 7250  wait you already bought the car  no we already bought the car  do i know my lady or what  honking  uhuh  i dont understand why youre so upset  i anticipated your needs  i thought you liked it when i did that  by anticipating my needs  i mean spraying febreze on your feet before coming to bed  not tricking me into doing something  that youve already done  you say trick i say delightful surprise  the point is were both proud owners  of a cool vintage automobile  oh no no no  i want nothing to do with that car thats yours  oh come on dont say that  were gonna have a blast in that thing  we were halfway to the grand canyon a minute ago  the only time im driving to a big hole with you  is to push you in it  okay im a police officer  and technically thats a death threat  well book me dumbo  i cant believe you played me like that  i knew when you saw how happy it made me  youd want me to have it  i mean you want me to be happy dont you  are you happy right now  that depends  do i get to keep the car  just so you know i already deposited the check  ill deal with you later  shame on you for taking advantage  of this candysneaking bonehead  all right  if were just going to resort to childish namecalling  im out of here  and i dont care what you say that car completes me  i cant believe he bought that car from you behind my back  in his defense 7800 is a great deal  for that classic automobile  7800  he told me 7250  boy every time he opens his mouth  a lie falls out of it huh  anybody got any jumper cables  i wouldve been a fool not to buy this car  and if she doesnt want to ride in it fine  itll just be the bromobile  does the bromobile have heat  because i for one am freezing my bronads off  roll up the window man  actually better to leave the windows down  until i get a handle on these exhaust fumes  coughs  yeah  coughs  every once in a while we should say the alphabet  just to make sure nobodys getting brain damage  does the radio work  absolutely  you have your choice of conservative talk  or contemporary ranchero  car clanking  what is that sound  its just settling  older cars have to settle  this thing has had  it sounds like a wheelchair going down a metal staircase  that is the detroit symphony  music to my ears  what comes after the letter l  m  you know  i still cant believe you bought this thing  without clearing it with molly  hey i brought her in after the fact  because i wanted to surprise her  like when the senegalese army moves into your home  calls it a barracks and tells you youre a corporal  surprise  i never lied to her  i just sat on the truth  until she came around to my way of thinking  whatever you need to say to look yourself in the mirror  by the way where is the mirror  it snapped off in an arbys drivethru  this things a little wider than im used to  huh  well thats new  its not that he bought the car  its just that he did it without telling me  he is kinda sneaky  the other day i saw him eating a chocolate bar behind a tree  i know he thinks hes skinnier than the tree  its actually  its kinda cute  well did you tell him that you didnt want him to buy the car  no i cant do that  then every time he sees a classic car on the road  id be the bad guy  its like when mom wouldnt let me have a pet monkey  even now when i see a chimp or a little old greek woman  i get pretty pod  yeah just like that  sweetie youre not fooling anyone  youre covered in chocolate  its not chocolate its engine gunk  wheres vince  hes upstairs  having a little trouble with the ol jalopy  its all good  you see tinkering under the hood is part of the fun  of owning a classic automobile  ah well it looks like youre having the time of your life  oh i am  excuse me  absolutely  jackass  vince  vince  vince what do you want  we need to talk about the car  glad youre enjoying it  what a deal huh  boy you saw me coming  get out here  okay so now you know my beauty secret  you sold me a piece of crap  are you familiar with the expression  buyer beware  are you familiar with the expression  im a cop and youre going to get parking tickets  for the rest of your life  the corruption in this city sickens me  get goin  the radiators overheating the transmissions slipping  and theres got to be a leak in the gas

this was a bad idea  hey i didnt know he was going to be such a baby about it  hey im not being a baby  you just knew things about this car you didnt divulge  oh and how did that make you feel  deceived  betrayed  like a boob  im sorry  i didnt know i couldnt buy something with my money  without clearing it with you  look when you put this ring on my finger we became a team  its not your money or my money its our money  okay well then you owe me for half of that ring  which will easily cover the cost of the repairs  just give him the money back vince  then how is he ever going to learn from his mistakes  do the right thing  and make it fast  in about four minutes  youre gonna start looking like count chocula  all right ill give you seven grand for the car  deal  hold on a
