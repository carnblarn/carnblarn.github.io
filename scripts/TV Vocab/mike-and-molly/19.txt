                that was a wonderful dinner mrs biggs  really delicious  peggy i dont cook much anymore  because of my sciatica  but if giving you kids a nice hot meal  means i got to endure a sharp stabbing pain  up and down my spine  then thats the price of admission  macaroon  are those from the old town bakery  oh those are my favorite  thats why i got them  theyre a little on the pricey side  but i guess i can dye my own roots this month  and jim can choke down bargain chow  that was very considerate  sorry  let me make you a cup of tea to go with that cookie  oh dont go to any trouble  no trouble i bought a whole box  of that english breakfast you enjoy  and im not a tea drinker  i figure if i want brown teeth ill chew tobacco  well iid love a cup of tea  my pleasure  you got yourself a real keeper there boy  i know mom  dont lose interest in her  like you did the piano lessons  karate and that turtle you got tired of feeding  quietly okay what the hell is going on  what do you mean  we spent the entire evening with your mother  and youre not thinking about killing yourself  and im not thinking about killing her  you know now that you mention it  she does seem unusually chipper tonight  chipper being sweet  thoughtful and complimentary  somethings very very wrong here  i mean she just told you i was a keeper  well you are a keeper  i know that she doesnt know that  even if she did she certainly wouldnt say it in front of me  im telling you something smells rotten here  and its not just jims bargain chow butt bombs  never saw the attraction to tea  i always considered it  the beverage of orientals and hippies  thank you mrs biggs  call me peggy  why  thats my name  okay  peggy hey  what would you think about  you and me getting together tomorrow  and having a bite to eat  ohhoho  that sounds great but i only get a half hour  and i usually just eat at my desk  well thats plenty time for us to eat and gab  can i bring jim  actually they dont allow dogs  in the school so  just guns and drugs huh  well i guess he can stay in the car  ill leave a chew toy and the radio on  like i used to do with mikey  its a date then  peggy  let me get you some lemon for your tea hmm  thank you  laughs  im pretty sure im getting whacked  for the first time in my life   i see love    youre not concerned at all about your mom  and your girlfriend getting together without you  why would i be  no reason  just making conversation  with the stupidest man on the planet  why am i stupid  i dont know thats for medical science to figure out  but i do know you dont want your mother telling molly  about all the twisted things you did as a kid  i was a pretty normal kid  i didnt do anything twisted uhhuh  so you never cut the mouth out of a playboy centerfold  and had your dog stick its tongue through it  so it looked like the girl was talking to you  no who would do something like that  doesnt matter  but trust me women get pretty freakedout  when they hear your grandma tell that story  thats not sitting too well with me either  so you never did anything embarrassing as a kid  you dont want molly to know about  well  i prefer she didnt know i visited the school nurse  once a week claiming to have a missing testicle  no you didnt  uh i was 12 and that nurse was smoking hot  had kind of a phoebe cates thing going on  oh i love me some phoebe cates  so did the missing testicle story actually work  first couple of times she bought into it  my big mistake was showing up with flowers  youre a romantic  and that aint nothing to be embarrassed about  you dont think so not at all  but molly may not find it as charming as you and i do  might be a good idea to have a nice dinner ready  for her tonight just in case  as ricky ricardo you got some splaining to do  good idea  so that nurse would just root around  trying to locate the missing marble  yep and if i held a cold mountain dew down my pants  take her almost three minutes  ah that is genius  i thought so  no seriously hats off  i noticed you didnt finish your meat loaf last night  so i trimmed off the bite marks  and slapped it between two pieces  of wonder bread enjoy  ohho  you added the mashed potatoes and corn too  i love corn in a sandwich  so thats where mike gets that  well youre probably wondering  why i requested this little powwow  really hadnt given it much thought  other than what a great idea  and why didnt we do it sooner  save the syrup  i just need a little womanly advice  womanly advice for you  dont worry its not about my plumbing  theres a man at my church who expressed interest  in spending time with me socially  you mean he asked you out on a date  dont act so surprised  no imim not  like im some kind of bugeyed troll no  im surprised you dont get asked out all the time  is where my surprise comes in  uhhuh anyway  he wants to take me to red lobster tomorrow night  its allyoucaneat shrimp tuesday  that sounds nice do you like this man  eh hes all right i guess  hes a widower  which means he hangs in there until they tag and bag you  you got to admire that  i think this is great  its flattering when someone is attracted to you  dont drag it through the gutter  in fact i told him were taking separate cars  in case he imagines throwing a few shrimp at me  entitles him to a free mount  a girl cant be too careful yep  thats why i sleep with a gun under my pillow  throw that in the conversation and you should be just fine  anyway  do you think mike could be okay with this  i think hed be thrilled  why  well hes never seen me  with another man besides his father  and i dont want to confuse the boy  hes pretty grown up and  i know he just wants you to be happy  lets just keep it on the sly until we see how it goes  i mean i dont want him getting attached to this man  going to ball games and whatnot  and then im the bad guy  if i have to kick him to the curb  i wont say anything to mike  and you tell him when youre comfortable  hes going to wonder why i asked to have lunch with you  mm ill just tell him that you  wanted to get to know me  because you thought it was important  that his two best gals become friends  nah hed never believe that  tell him i came to you to learn to read  its my secret shame  well hopefully he wont ask  hey  hey sweetie  let me help you  aw thanks what smells so good  that would be my worldfamous fivealarm chili  you cooked  well you cook for me all the time  it seems only right that i should cook for you  and i havent always done the right thing in my life  but people change  yes they do  im not the same guy i was when i met you  and im certainly not the same guy i was  between the ages of 12 and 14  uhhuh  so chili you say  yep my special recipe  and the secret ingredient is corn  can i get you a nice light beer  or perhaps a chilled glass of chardonnay  oh id love a glass of wine  coming up  so how was your day  pretty good  i forgot all about it  so what did she chew your ear off about  uh nothing much  she just needed a sounding board about something  its really no big deal  oh good so no health issues or anything right  she didnt find a lump on something did she  no no  nothing other than you on her couch  thats funny  so i didnt come up in the conversation at all  her only son that seems weird to me  okay she might have mentioned you once or twice  look i dont know what my mom told you  but i am not the reason the school nurse transferred  to another district the janitor knocked her up  what are you rambling on about  i dont know maybe i should stop talking  your mom just wanted my advice on something  its not a big deal  well if its not a big deal why cant you tell me  because she asked me not to  so it had nothing to do  with a young boys innocent infatuation  with hernia exams  no  what  look look  i will tell you but you have to promise  that youre not going to say anything to your mom i promise  seriously cause she has put her trust in me  and i dont want to do anything to compromise it  ill keep my mouth shut  just tell me  shes going out on a date  ah come on  if you needed to lie to me  at least pick something thats plausible  im adopted shes really a man  something i could buy  there is a gentleman at church that asked her out  and she said yes  and she wanted my advice  and to help her get ready tomorrow night  wait hm  my moms going out on a date  she is  but you cant let on that you know  okay  and i appreciate you telling me  sure chuckles  what is the deal with the school nurse  laughing oh oh nothing  i tricked her into touching my genitals  is this too spicy  i got yelled at at work today  who yelled at ya  you put makeup on corpses  i was working on a 80yearold cadaver  and her grandson got his panties in a bunch  because i put body glitter in her cleavage  im like dude chill just because your grandmas dead  doesnt mean she cant look hot  doorbell rings  great philosophy  molly its why she put it on her business card  listen when i die mmhmm  you just pull out the stops  i want to look peaceful but doable  please tell me youre not taking jim on your date with you  hes a hell of an icebreaker  he can stay here with us  come on in  i brought a couple outfits  i wanted something that looks feminine  but doesnt make him think im lifting my skirt  and ringin the dinner bell  um well its probably a good idea  to stick with the stretch pants  sweet lord this is nerveracking  why do women put themselves through this  i dont have an answer for that  but lets not make too big a deal out of this  remember its just dinner  well bear in mind  i havent been on a date with a man in almost 40 years  so theres been nobody since mikes dad  nobody before or after  this keg was only tapped for one party  unlike you gals today we didnt just give it away  to any smooth talker with a fast car  and a cigarillo dangling between his lips  look why dont we just focus on the task at hand  and help you pick out a nice outfit  now what are our options  uh this and what i got on  we can work with this  might wanna spruce it up a little with some accessories  but why dont you  come upstairs ill show you what i have  all right but no dangly earrings or feather boas  i go too feminine i start to look like a transsexual  jim  so did your mom tell molly the story about  your old hidden ball trick  no they didnt talk about me at all  turns out my mom just wanted some advice  about going out on a date  wait a second peggy biggs is going on a date  let me wrap my head around that  nope cant do it  hey i think its great  itd be nice for her to have someone to spend some time with  you know a companion  take some pressure off of you huh  yeah and the dog  poor bastard really bears the brunt of most of it  well i hope she knows what shes getting into  because the sexual landscape has changed for the over60 crowd  what are you talking about  viagra it put peaks where there used to be valleys  hes right those old dudes aint going  gently into that good night no more  they pop a couple of those little blue pills  and theyre not taking what for an answer  this is just some lonely widower from her church  that wants to take her out for dinner  the lonely widowers are the worst  theyre making up for lost time so church groups and vfw halls  are like trout farms for those wrinkly romeos  its true the natural cycle of a mans life has been upset  by erection enhancers  there are no more wise elders sitting in the town square  carving wooden flutes and offering sage advice  now theyre all getting hair plugs  and trying to bone your sister  you should see some of these lazaruslooking horn dogs  my grandma brings down for breakfast  eating cream of wheat and smiling at me  mimics old man mornin son whats your name how old are you  old enough to know what you been doing  to my precious nana last night  you know im starting to feel a little uneasy  about this whole thing  the trick is to not think about it  once you start imagining your mom  doing the nasty with the cryptkeeper  then youre in for some sleepless nights  sighs  perfectly natural for you to be nervous  after mollys dad died i waited almost three years  before i went out with another man  didnt you ever get lonely  lonely no  horny yes  theres a reason you girls ate  nothing but banana bread for three years  i liked working with bananas  for the record im not one of those people  you have to open up to  less is more in my book  im sure your gentleman friend will be glad to hear that  what about this  well i wasnt planning on doing  the dance of the seven veils tonight  no no i just thought you might want a little color  sure while were at it  why dont we put some lipstick on my nipples  seems a little extreme but since were on the topic  a little makeup wouldnt hurt  makeup i dont wear makeup  ever  well i might put some beet juice on my lips  for christmas mass  but my mottos always been a little powder a little paint  makes you something that you aint  really  well my mottos always been dinners on you  and the rest of the nights on me  sighs  could you please hold still  im not used to doing this  with somebody breathing all over my fingers  or breathing period  just do your best baby  remember its only for one night not for all eternity  and just make me look presentable  not like i got tyrone the pimp waiting for me in the car  see when you talk  it totally freaks me out  i was just thinking the same thing  i found a really cute pair of earrings  that i think might go with that outfit  hang on let me just put  a little more concealer on your mustache  and oh  voila  peggy you look great nice job  thanks it was fun  getting to do the back of her neck  i usually dont get to do the back of a neck  try these on  my dad gave them to me  for my first communion  i wouldnt feel right wearing these  i want you to  plus theyre the only pair left in the house  that you havent written off as hooker hoops  okay  they and you  look beautiful  you clean up pretty good huh  this isnt me  no its a reflection of you  i cant do this  peggy groans  peggy  i appreciate your help but this whole saturday night fever  shakeyourbootie lifestyle aint for me  come on peggy calm down  no no ive gone down this road before  and ill tell you where it leads heartache  hey everyone has had their heart broken  i certainly have  but if id just given up i never would have met mike  right there theres another reason not to go  i dont want my little boy thinking  that his mother is some kind  of tavernhopping hotsietotsie  oh he would never think that  in fact if he could see how beautiful you looked right now  i know he would want you to go out and enjoy yourself  you told him didnt you  scoffs  i most certainly did not peggy  you told me that in confidence  now i understand that you are nervous peggy  but it took the work of three women  to get you looking presentable ly beautiful  and im not gonna let you waste this sitting on the couch  eating dayold meat loaf  now give me the dog and go have a good time  thanks for you know  youre welcome peggy  call me mrs biggs  the poor bastard at the red lobster has no idea  what hes gotten himself into  ugh boy we have got to get you off the bargain chow  sighs where the hell is she  the red lobster closed an hour ago  how do you know that  look at him you dont think hes closed a few  allyoucaneat places in his day  im just saying allowing for drive time  going by mollys to pick up jim  she shouldve been home by now  well they might still be in the parking lot  your moms got that bigass impala  the backseats like a daybed  mimics springs creaking  cut it out thats not funny
