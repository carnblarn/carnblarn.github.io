boyfriend  i told you hes just a fellow from my church  that im seeing socially  socially is that what you kids  are calling it these days  im not amused by the tramp talk  regardless i think its a good idea for me  to get a look at this guy and size him up  got to warn you hes a smoottalker  man could sell sand to an arab  hey im a police officer and i can spot a con man a mile away  and they love to prey on frail vulnerable women like yourself  thats true  thatll be him  take a seat mom i got this  promise me you two stags wont lock horns in the living room  dont worry im just gonna lay out a few ground rules  let him know im keeping an eye on him  you must be little mikey  yeah hi come on in  thank you  dennis richardson is my name  im your moms  friend from church  friend from church  forgive my tardiness  i didnt allow for enough time to cook dinner  as well as give myself a haircut  i can vouch for the tastiness of the food  but i wouldnt take a tape measure to these sideburns  you cooked dinner at your house  cooking here implies a level of domesticity  that makes margaret uneasy  oh by the way shoes on or shoes off  leave em on these kids dont need  to see you running around half naked  understood  oh  and i bought you some baseball cards  upper deck  uh thanks  hi im molly mikes girlfriend  oh really margaret never mentioned  that little mikey was seeing someone  well its an honor and a privilege to meet you molly  im afraid that  since i was unaware of your existence  i neglected to bring you a gift  oh dont worry about it its just nice to meet you dennis  perhaps i could offer you a book of stamps  or a crisp fivedollar bill  no  look at him work his magic  sand to an arab   dinner was delicious  good for you finding a man who knows his way around the kitchen  hey i know my way around the kitchen  i meant cooking not finding an oreo in the dark  oh  while the dishes are soaking  shall i whip us up a batch of my homemade oatmeal scotchies  i could eat a cookie  oh werewere fine dennis  were trying to lay off sweets  aw  that was a really wonderful meal  whered you learn to cook like that  i was a cook in the army during the vietnamese conflict  vietnam wow  did you see any combat  thats how i got this bum ear artillery barrage  if i hadnt covered my head  with that stock pot of chipped beef  i dont think id be standing before you today  i thought you were gonna make cookies  id eat a cookie no no no cookies  why dont you sit down with us for a while  he doesnt like to sit its true  probably from all that time i spent crouching in a bamboo cage  getting poked by a vietcong bayonet  oh my god you were a pow  in a snakeinfested swamp  still better than high school though  aw boohoo  cinderella  quit boring these kids with your sob stories  youre absolutely right margaret  this evening is not about me  its about little mikey and his lovely girlfriend  so  how long have you two been together  i dont know for like maybe a year  seven months  i was rounding up  so are you young people hearing wedding bells in your future  oh  what the hells the matter with you  they they havent been together that long  the wheels could fall off this wagon on the drive home  well i dont know about that  i think were doing fine were moving along very nicely  absolutely we got a good thing here  and we dont need to ruin it by talking about marriage  well i dont think wed ruin it  oh ii didnt mean ruin  i just mean spoil or taint  taint  the point is  thats a conversation for another time  way in the future  so how far in the future are you talking about  because im in my 30s id like to have children someday  well me too but  but what  uh  it would appear that ive opened up  a can of worms  and you wonder why people lock you in cages  and poke you with knives  i never even met the man and he asked  if molly and i are planning on getting married  well once somebody drops the mbomb  it changes everything never goes away  its like trying to get dog crap out of a tennis shoe  you can hose it down take an old toothbrush to it  dont matter that shoe aint never gonna smell right  all i know is im not gonna rush into anything  when molly and i are both ready thats when  were gonna get married good for you  just dont you dare elope on me  itll break my heart and i will never ever forgive you  what are you talking about  well im assuming im your best man  unless you got another guy who heimlichd  the sugar baby out of your windpipe  and i would be honored  to be a groomsman as long as you pair me with mollys sister  i am bound and determined to tap that  listen you can both just relax  molly and i arent anywhere near getting married  well when the time is right youll know  but let me say i am a sucker for a spring wedding  oh yes the flowers are beautiful  and the season gives you that sense of new beginnings  it is the midwest though so youre  rolling the dice on the weather  thats why you plan an outdoor wedding  but with an indoor option  oh  listen ladies nobodys getting married  understood  but i will need at least three weeks notice  if you want a decent bestman speech  and if anybodys tapping mollys sister  its gonna be me  uh good luck with that  you have the badge but i have the accent  oh and a good bachelor party  cant just be thrown together at the last minute  thats true we should probably start  scouting out strip clubs right now  we can begin downtown and then work our way to the airport  mm i dont know  those places get nastier the closer you get to the airport  i say we start there  vince sweetie its not a big deal  once in a while its gonna happen to a man your age  yeah but its never happened to me before  im so humiliated  hey im a patient woman  and i know eventually when you relax a little  and take the pressure off yourself  youll remember exactly where you left your viagra  lucky for us theres more than one way to skin a cat  i pray to god youre talking about skinning an actual cat  wheres the big guy sleeping in  no things were kind of awkward between us last night  so he slept at his place  see not every night can be mardi gras  sometimes a man is tired and overworked  so he forgets where he put his erection enhancers  goodbye  no sit down honey  now vince hush  now listen if you and mike are having troubles  you can talk to us about it  its no big deal  last night somebody brought up the topic of marriage  and mike panicked  what do you mean panicked  you know his face turned white and he started fidgeting  and chewing his thumb he looked like a giant baby  that had to go peepee  can you imagine powdering that big bottom  mom  sorry sorry  um honey you know he loves you  im sure like all men hes just a little gunshy  was that a shot at me  cause when i find my little blue friends  ill show you whos gunshy  well retrace your steps honey  anyway  i dont know mom i feel like ive been  pushing mike since day one of this relationship  i asked him out  i was the first one who wanted to sleep together  maybe i should just back off until he figures out  what it is he really wants  well what do you want sweetie  i want to marry the guy someday  but i dont want him to feel like im railroading him  then youre just gonna have to relax  and trust that if its meant to be itll be  take life as it comes  oh i suck at that  in my glove compartment  from the time we did it at the car wash  t minus 30 minutes and counting  are we good here  cause sometimes when i stare  at the oneeyed monster it happens quicker  go  so what are you up for  grab a bite maybe catch a movie  whatever you want to do im just easy peasy japanesey  okeydokey  call me pokey  seriously though  a nice dinner and a late movie  or a quick snack and an early one  mike its up to you  i just want to enjoy our time together  with no expectations  great  whatever happens happens  all righty  why dont we try to narrow down what kind of food we want  and just take it from there  sounds like a plan  okay what are you hungry for  well i had a turkey burger for lunch so  whatever you want is fine with me  id even eat another turkey burger  really  if i had to  how about italian  sure  or we could do chinese  ooh sounds good  maybe well just grab a hot dog at the movie  im with that too  so where are we headed  i dont know i cant answer that question  i mean i love you i know that much  mike im just trying to figure out  where you want to have dinner  aw crap  everything was going so good then somebody mentions marriage  and now we cant even just hang out  told you man  that tennis shoe aint never gonna smell the same  hey its not that i dont want to marry molly  i just kind of wanted to have my life more together before i asked her  please tell me this aint about your weight  cause youve been losing and gaining the same 14 pounds since i met you  its not that  ive made peace with the fact  that im always gonna be a little stocky   stocky  let it go  i wanted to have a little more money in the bank you know  be farther along in my career  i mean i always imagined getting married  in my dress blues with sergeant stripes on my sleeve  oh thats nice  i always pictured white tuxedo with black piping  but the dress blues is a great idea  right with the gloves and the hats under our arms  yeah thats a sharp look  plus the dark blue will make you look a tad less stocky  all right boys im heading out   its my bridge night  who you trying to fool  everybody knows tonights your poker night  yeah but i have to cross a bridge to get there  michael how come youre not with molly this evening  ah were just kind of taking a night off from each other  the topic of marriage came up  oh im sorry baby did she turn you down   no  dont sit there and tell me  you turned her down cause that would make him the smart one  and i dont want to live in a world where thats true  hey theres nothing wrong  with a man taking his time and not acting impulsively  oh please  the only reason you didnt marry  that mailorder russian bride  is because you maxed out your credit card having phone sex  that was not phone sex  that was a singles chat room  mmhmm and was everybody else in the chat room  sitting in their grandmas hall closet  with their hand down their pants  you ever heard of knocking  you ever heard of knocking it off  and why you dragging your feet  you know you love that girl  i do i just want to know i can take care of her  be the kind of guy she deserves  well dont waste too much time trying to be a better man  cause you aint never gonna be one without a good woman  and what are the chances of lightning  hitting this big barn again  well i can honestly say i am not done with my bachelorhood  yeah carl mcmillan has a lot of living and loving left to do  then you need to get out of my closet and go find a woman  shoot i have to cover my eyes  to even reach in and grab an umbrella  i mean i know mike loves me and i love him  and when the topic of marriage came up  i could have just let it go  well now you know for next time  no its already out there its in his head marriage  god i even said i wanted to have kids someday  guys never want to hear that  especially when theyre already married and have kids  i should have just left well enough alone  but i had to push it  i always have to take charge and guys hate that  unless youre wearing a black bustier  and holding a riding crop  then they practically beg for it  how does that help me  im just saying guys are weird  the important thing is that mike and i are happy  and that that should be enough  absolutely  but its not  now i want it all and i want to know that im getting it all  im sure he wants the same thing  and hell come around to it eventually  oh please he doesnt know what he wants  last night he couldnt make a decision  between a restaurant and a movie  we shared a lean cuisine while watching  ice trucker reruns  well its up to you to tell him what he wants  no i cant do that  that makes me a pushy broad  hes got to come to it on his own  i thought you just said he cant come to it on his own  no hes useless  but you still want to marry him  of course i love him  okay if were going to keep talking  i need to be way higher than i am right now  continue  what do you mean you cant help me find my dog  youre the fire department  not a priority  but greasing your big muscly chests  and posing for calendars is  what the hell happened  i let dennis take jim for a walk and he lost him  ah damn im sure hes fine  hes probably sleeping under the gundersons shed again  no oh he ran away to make a point  mom come on  this was his house and i brought another man into it  now hes punishing me  i highly doubt that its personal  everythings personal with jim  i think the world of him but he knows what my buttons are  and he knows how to push em  well the prodigal dog has returned  jim  oh  he rolled in some unidentified fecal matter  and what is not matted in his fur  i believe is lodged between his teeth  thanks for finding him  what are you thanking him for  hes the reason he got lost in the first place  mom just take it easy everythings fine now  i understand your anger margaret  it was foolish of me to take him off leash at the park  so that he and i might cavort freely  foolish it was idiotic  you almost lost  the most precious thing in the world to me  second most precious  uhhuh  come on jim lets get the possum scat out of your fur  possum  your mother sure does know her animal dung  as soon as she cools off im sure everything will be fine  i hope so  your mother and i have had our romance  on slow simmer for seven years now  and id hate to see it bubble over  just because jim chased a squirrel into a poop pipe  seven years  your mother is  a sensitive and delicate flower  handily disguised by a hateful and abusive demeanor  well i do know she was pretty broken up when my dad left  and im guessing she just doesnt want to be hurt again  interesting  does your unwillingness to commit to your girlfriend  make you a chip off the old block  not that im calling your mother an old block  shes more stocky  i dont know i hadnt really thought about it  love is a frightening thing isnt it mikey  yes it is  almost as bad as being buried up to your neck  and trying to keep rats from chewing off your eyelids  wow did that really happen to you  sure did  i guess high school was tough for everybody  why do we have  to do this right now  need to clear the air with molly  and let her know why ive been dragging my feet  i owe her that much  miss flynn  mike what are you doing here  sorry to interrupt i just need to have a word with your teacher  cant this wait  no i need to tell you something  all right quiet study time  books open mouths closed  what is up  i love you molly  quiet  i love you too  now get out of here  im not done  i also want you to know that im really happy  with what weve got  absolutely and theres no reason to rush into anything  until were both sure were ready  it would appear im ready  shut up  shut up  really  molly flynn will you marry me  are you sure this is really what you want  id get down on my knees  but im not sure i could get back up  seriously i dont  ii dont want you to feel pressured into anything  i dont  in fact i havent felt this sure  about anything in a long time  is that a yes  ye yes  people please pipe down  a precious moment  when did you get this ring  about two weeks after i met you  look at me im gonna be a best man  if someone would have told me a year ago that  seven months  seven months ago that id be standing up here  next to this incredible woman  an engaged man and eight pounds lighter  i never would have believed them  i mean four pounds maybe but  anyway we just want to thank you for coming  and sharing this moment with us  so whens the wedding  whats the matter with you  you got shrapnel in your noggin  im thinking next spring sunset lincoln park  when the azaleas are in bloom  but with an indoor option in case of inclement weather  or rain  hey me and red are going to tie the knot  near an active volcano on the island of kauai  maybe theyd throw us a twofer  oh a double wedding with my daughter  ive always dreamed of that  really thats a very peculiar dream  you have got to keep your piehole shut  the whole tent is covered with flowers  it doesnt look like a tent  i love you mike i love you molly
