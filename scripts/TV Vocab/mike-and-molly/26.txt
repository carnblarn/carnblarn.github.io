                1 sighs damn it  mike  screw it ive touched his underwear enough for one night  mike  no i got it   perfect  molly someone is at the door  its me  what are you doing out there  thinking about another load id like to shove in the drier  let me get that for you sweetie wow this is heavy  its because the clothes are still damp because apparently your drier is actually  more of a slot machine  what the hell  this thing has been on 350 for over an hour  its not even warm  uh thats because  if you want 350 you got to put it on clean  whats broil  i dont know jewish holiday  so basically im left  with one pot and one working burner  ooh sounds like were having chili tonight  i dont understand why we dont just live at my house  with your mom and sister why not  at least till we save up enough money to buy our own place  but this is my home  ive lived here for almost 15 years  and you still only have one pot  i only have one working burner  this apartment is not big enough for two people  i mean theres only  one closet theres no counter space in the bathroom  i offered to put a tv tray in there for you  why dont you just move the one you have next to the toilet  thats reading table  convenient cause its right next to your thinking seat  come on just consider it  i mean everything we need is at my house  except privacy  here its just us  our cozy little love nest our romantic piedterre  i brought hot wings  and rodeo bloopers for halftime  cool mollys making chili  yay  for the first time in my life   i see love    well if i do move in with molly  itll definitely cut down on expenses  plus my neighborhoods not exactly the safest for a woman  why dont you get her a big dog or teach her judo  no thats stupid how is that stupid  i dont know thats what molly said when i suggested it  man i hate to see you get rid of that apartment  its like a quiet sanctuary for me  why dont you sublet it that way you can  move out of your grandmothers house  oh i cant do that  cooking and cleaning for me is what keeps that old woman vital  and the yard work  when did this become about me  youre the one surrendering the fort  what are you talking about  you move in with molly  youre giving up home field advantage  shes always shirts youre always skins  nobody wants to see that  yeah thats true  with her sister and mother there  shell always have two women taking her side  which means the outcome of the vote is predetermined  or as they call it in my country democracy  you know and i understand you want to save money  but what good is money if you cant  sit on the toilet with the door open  or drink milk right out of the cow  you mean carton  you americans are so spoiled  why does this frosting taste funny  theres no pot in it  thats what it is  hey whos the birthday cake for  oh mikes mothers boyfriend  oof still cant believe that thing has a boyfriend  well lid for every pot ass for every saddle i guess  sighs im exhausted  between mikes chili trumpet  and the feral cat gangbang outside the window  i only got about three hours of sleep  why didnt you guys stay here last night  im trying to be fair  and stay a couple nights a week over at his place  plus itll toughen me up if i ever have to  survive in the wilderness or  south american womens prison  the soaps always a pubefest and anythings a handkerchief  yeah but if a mans place is too neat and clean  you know hes either married or gay  and in one awkward case both  well we talked about it last night  and i think i have got him convinced  to give up his place and come live with us  what  is that not okay  are you talking about him living here forever  well no just until we get married  and save up enough money to buy a home of our own  sounds like forever to me  wow i never imagined you guys would have an issue with this  i guess ill just tell mike  that my mom and my sister dont want him here  no honey  we can make it work  we just need to come up with some guidelines  might want to think about getting  a television for the bedroom  i mean for a guy who doesnt smoke weed  he sure watches a lot of tv  and hes gonna have to start chipping in for groceries  well of course  it should be based on consumption  not a you know flat rate allyoucaneat type of deal  yeah and for a guy who doesnt smoke weed  he sure does eat a lot of food  and i will say im more than a little nervous  about there being a gun in the house  nt worry  i promise that he will keep it locked up good  cause you know how i get when i drink  and it would tear me apart if anything happened to you girls  happy birthday dear dennis   happy birthday to you   yay yay  make a wish  oh what could i possibly want that i dont already have  id request a little hearing back in your right ear  im tired of having to throw my slipper at you  to get your attention  any attention from you is good attention margaret  youre making it weird  just blow  yay yay  here you go  its a personal pedicure kit  his toenails are like indian corn  you know what no cake for me  this is so thoughtful  thank you  you get those talons corralled and come christmas  you might be unwrapping a new pair of opentoed shoes  ooh youre planning christmas already  i think thats really adorable  well your approval is the reason  i get out of bed in the morning  mmm i do love lemon cake  i guess ive always enjoyed sour things  that explains a lot  barks  i was joking  its time for his postdinner squat  ill take him margaret  mikey why dont you go with him  dont make the birthday boy pick up a hot tootsie roll  can i take my cake  ew mike  oh dont try to break him of that  he used to eat ice cream while he got his hair cut  door closes  you and dennis seem to be getting along great  i was wary of him at first  but hes proven himself to be a fairly decent companion  well he pursued you for seven years  thats clearly a man that wanted him some peggy biggs  i stretched out the courtship longer than  most men would tolerate  but he kept his powder dry and his eye on the prize  and tonight his patience will be rewarded  how so  carnally  yikes  thats wonderful  um its inspiring to know that two people  can find each other this late in life  im sorry is there a toe tag on me i havent seen  no im just saying its nice to know  theres many chapters in the book of love  yeah well this book hasnt seen a bookmark for 30 years  and im a little nervous about cracking it open  wow 30 years  it could very well crack  im just so damn nervous youd think it was my first time  i mean look at me im shaking like a 14yearold virgin  fourteen  i grew up on a farm  we were poor we had to make our own fun  you got to put the banjo down eventually  and im afraid that once dennis satisfies his needs  hes gonna hit the bricks and im just gonna be  another notch on his reversible belt  i understand that youre feeling vulnerable  but tonight you got to just trust your heart  and jump back on the horse  back on the horse  refresh me is that the one where the gals on top  but facing the other way  you know what im gonna have some cake  humming  not too bad for an old broad huh jim  well youd love me no matter what  youve seen me cry youve seen me naked  and youve sat on my lap while ive done my morning business  heavy sigh  boy itd be so much easier  if i were a dog or you were a man  well wish me luck  and again im sorry i had your testicles removed  all right dennis lights off  and keep your eyes closed till im securely under the covers  and just a few ground rules  no biting  no spanking and hey not there means  hey not there  other than that enjoy my secret garden  dennis  chuckles  singsongy dennis  chuckling  its a little late to play hardtoget  coughs lightly  den  chuckles  oh my god  dennis  oh no  oh my god this is terrible  gasping breaths  mikey  something horrible has happened  jim stop it that is not a chew toy  i  knocking mike mom  mom  all right mom what happened  i dont know he just died  what the hell did you do to him peggy biggs  shh shh  i i came downstairs and  saw him like this  slumped in front of your girlfriends birthday cake  mike all right just calm down  and let me do what i do  youre wasting your time that man is stonecold dead  why has he got all this carpet fuzz in his hair  i dont know he was probably  rrolling a ball around on the floor with jim  his shirts not buttoned right  hes not wearing a belt  hes only got one shoe on listen  if i wanted the fashion police  i certainly wouldnt have called you  carl i need you over at my moms place asap  why are you turning this into a big csi thing  man had a piece of sour cake and croaked  just because he cant button his shirt  doesnt mean im a murderer  molly shes hysterical do me a favor and take her over to your house  so youre sticking with the cake story  mind your business nancy drew  anything about that body seem weird to you  i mean other than the ninedollar haircut  not really you seen one dead body you seen em all  what about this marking on the rug  looks like somebody was dragging something down the stairs  its probably the dog hes got itchy anal glands  and this carpets really  just his personal walltowall ass scratcher  no something about this doesnt add up  i mean your mom claims she was upstairs while he was down here  eating cake with only one sock on come on  who amongst us hasnt eaten cake with only one sock on  im just saying this crime scene  has definitely been tampered with  its not a crime scene shaft  the coroner said it was a heart attack  im not disputing the cause of death  im just saying he didnt die in those clothes in that chair eating this cake  lemon  molly made it  lemon for a birthday  im telling you none of this adds up  yeah whatever we need to go to his apartment  try and locate any next of kin  see if he had any sort of living will  just follow me on this is it possible he couldve died upstairs  and your mom dragged the body down here  why the hell would she do that  im just saying maybe he got more than a piece of cake tonight  crossed the line there didnt i  you gonna be okay  im numb  i cant believe hes gone  well you gave him a wonderful last birthday and  the only questionable behavior was when you  dragged his dead body down the stairs  and propped him up in an eating position  i couldnt let mikey find him upstairs in my bed  one loose woman in his life is enough  at least i held out past 14  knocking  hi i just want to say  i am very sorry for your loss  thank you  if theres anything i can do  to help you through this difficult time  like say put makeup on your recently deceased boyfriend  victoria  its a very competitive field  we have an expression the early worm gets the dead bird  victoria  cell phone numbers on the back  and consultations are free out  tell her ill give her half off on the next stiff  sorry  sobbing oh dennis  continues sobbing  its gonna be okay  now just try to focus on the fun  you two had and  tonight must have been nice you know  till he died  never got that far  i guess the image of our two naked bodies entwined as one  was more than his bum ticker could take  sniffles  im getting a little palpitation myself  i made that poor man court me for seven years  well you biggs like to take it slow  oh  maybe i didnt want him to find out i wasnt perfect  i wanted to remain that pristine alabaster goddess  that he fell in love with  yeah sure  youyou could tell from how he looked at you  that he loved you  really  oh are you kidding  eyes lit up every time you walked into the room  mm  thats how mikey looks at you you know  does he yep  he loves you so much hes blind to the glaring imperfections  that the rest of us see oh so clearly  huh  so when you dragged his body down the stairs  was it by his feet or his head  theres nothing around here to indicate  that dennis lived any kind of life at all  yeah  carl does this apartment seem familiar to you at all  yeah you feeling it too  cause ive been dj vuing ever since we walked in the door  what a sad and lonely existence  only one pot  and one working burner  who could live like this  well at least his last moments on earth  were spent with a woman who really cared about him  thats true a mans lucky to find something like that  yes i am  grab his address book lets get out of here  hey so you think he died while they were doing it  or during the sweet afterglow  crossed that line again  didnt i grunts  sighs  everything okay  yeah is my mom all right  yeah i made her a xanax smoothie  shes upstairs sleeping like a big mean baby  good  its nice of you to let her stay in our room  our room  well yeah when i move in its gonna be our room right  last time we talked you didnt seem too keen on the idea  well ive had some time to mull it over  and weigh the pros and cons  and ive decided that i would rather live with the woman i love  than die sad and lonely hunched over a piece of lemon cake  oh mike dennis didnt die of  yes he did case closed okay okay okay fine fine  so are you ready to move in here  well id better be i already called my landlord  and gave notice on the drive over here  come here  hey theres the new roomie  evening mrs flynn  i heard your mama rang a guys bells  all the way to heaven tonight  its a house full of women we talk
