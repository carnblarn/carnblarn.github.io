                chamomile and honey for my lady beer and clamato for me  thank you why in the hell you drink that stuff  right back at you  hey you given any thought on what you like to do for our honeymoon  can i have my heart set on intercourse  obviously thats contingent on how much i drink on the reception  oh no youll be putting out pal  its my weeding night and i planned on losing my virginity again  duly noted  now i know its kinda clich  but i was thinking honeymoon in paris could be really romantic  paris france  no mike paris tennessee  you jest but it does have a mini eiffel tower  and is home to the worlds largest fish fry  why did i ever buy you that eatin atlas of america  its the best christmas present i ever got  its my bible and my wish book  and the most dogeared piece of literature in the bathroom  but i was thinking more of the european paris  springtime were sitting at a sidewalk cafe  sipping little cups of chocolat  hey if its chocolate youre craving  we should just go to the belly of the beast  hershey pennsylvania  its an entire city dedicated to the magical cocoa bean  very tempting but um  paris has history and these amazing museums  and beautiful architecture  you know what you just described  cleveland ohio  they got the rock and roll hall of fame there  and its shaped like a big guitar  good to know  thats history architecture and museum combined  its the jello 123 of vacation spots  all roads really do lead back to food for you dont they  i just want to go somewhere special  then how about driving to missouri  and taking an oldtimey paddleboat ride  down the mighty mississip  sure and when we drop anchor in saint louie  maybe we can go get a big old bucket of ozark puddin  howd you know about ozark puddin  ah i read  vince drop it  i told you hes an old friend and were having dinner  not just any old friend an old boyfriend  ugh will you explain to this lunkhead that a woman is capable  of being just friends with an old former lover  hey if it didnt end with name calling and tire slashing  then the embers of desire are still smoldering  actually vince im friends with almost all my exes  yeah but they were all swishes  howd you put it mike  like the front row of a cher concert  i never used the word swish  i said pansy  mom who are you meeting anyway  remember richard  ooh richard wow  what does that mean ooh richard wow  nothing  i forbid you to go out with ooh richard wow  oh you forbid me  well that changes everything  dont wait up  okay you can go  but i want you back here by 1000  and your panties better not be in your purse  dont be such an ass  you know i never wear panties with this dress  story of my life  i give a woman my heart  and she says no thanks  balls please  mike say something  oh sure  vince when somebody says the word chocolate  what city springs to mind   for the first time in my life    i see love   she expects me to believe  that some old boyfriend calls her up out of the blue  and just wants to take her to dinner  who the hell does that  well vince human behavior has changed a lot  since you slithered out of the ocean and lost your tail  i dont even know what that means  was that a shot  yes it was  its not a big deal  mom and richard dated a long time ago  he was a pilot she was working as a flight attendant  i know what goes on between pilots and stews  ive seen more than my share of pornography  ugh  hes not wrong  it is one of the more popular storylines  which i dont watch  ill bet at this very minute shes helping that jet jockey  into his full and upright position  vince youre talking about my mother  youre right not for your ears  her mothers a sexual volcano  insatiable  i can still hear you  apologies  one time  we were at the olive garden  and she took her shoe off under the table  get him out of here  vince lets go grab a beer  and i dont know how she does it  but her big toe and second toe  can form an almost perfect circle  if i didnt know any better id swear it was my own hand  i should have locked joyce in her closet  and then met that guy at the restaurant swinging a rake  you know thats technically kidnapping  and assault with a deadly weapon  oh what are you gonna be tonight  a cop or a friend  im kind of feeling the need to be both  look when youre in a relationship  you cant just forbid the other person from doing stuff  otherwise its guaranteed theyre gonna do it  thats just human nature  what the hell are you talking about  threats and ultimatums are the glue of love  without it were no better than animals  in my experience you have to have give and take  like this whole honeymoon thing with me and molly  she wants to go to paris and i dont  what do you got against paris its beautiful  plus if you can stomach pit hair on chicks  you can see free boobs on tv  you should be a travel agent  but im still not gonna risk my life flying  half way across the world just to see free boobs  thats where you and i differ  id fly to bangladesh to see a pair of knockers  so whats the problem  you afraid of flying  no but when im traveling  i like knowing if theres trouble  i can jump out of a window without plummeting to my death  can you imagine the size crater youd make  tourists could ride mules to the bottom  what im saying is i cant just say to molly  were not going to paris  because then wed definitely be going to paris  so youre telling me if i dont want joyce to bang that guy  i should say hey joyce go bang that guy  no thats not even close to what im saying  then make your point and stop dancing around the subject  like some kind of woman  look  if you really care about joyce  maybe try using a gentler approach  less shouting more listening  you mean like  joyce love of my life answer to my prayers  if i find out youre banging that flyboy  ill kill all three of us  you know i think this is why we dont hang out more  so did you and mike figure out a honeymoon spot yet  well im still hoping for a piedterre in paris  but hes still pushing for a popup camper in the backyard  i would say try and meet in the middle  but i cant imagine where that would be  im starting to think hes not too keen on flying  every time i bring it up he turns all pale and clammy  he gets the same way when i ask who ate all my chips ahoy  yeah pale and clammy is kind of his tell  mines whistling  you are a nervous whistler  hey what if you cured his fear of flying with hypnosis  and while hes under  tell him my cookies are actually rattlesnakes  hey there she is  and home by 1030  how was your date  what are you talking about it wasnt a date  it was dinner nothing more  sorry  every time you go out to dinner is it a date  yes but not with every date do i get dinner  yeah well this was just dinner  we ate we caught up i got the hell out of there  okay fine  why dont you worry about your own lives  god two grown women with nothing better to do  than gossip about their mother while sucking down her wine  wow whats up with her  hard to say  having dinner with an old boyfriend can be very emotional  especially when they slide an std pamphlet across the table  morning  morning sweetheart  you want some breakfast  no i dont want to put you out  besides im pretty sure those are your eggs  oh that  well you know how nasty i get when i drink rum  im like a pirate that way  except louder meaner and no parrot  i apologize  now let mommy make you an omelette  thanks  youre welcome sweetheart  look im not trying to pry or anything  but did everything go all right with you and richard last night  what are you implying  nothing im just worried about you  when the hell are you gonna get your own house anyway  i think ill pass on the omelette red beard  excuse me while i go answer your door  yeah damn right its my door  and its my toilet  tell your boyfriend other people in this house have to poop too  hey vince  please excuse my showing up unannounced  i just wanted to stop by  and give these flowers to your mother  ill make sure she gets them  i got a friend in little armenia who gives me a deal  thats why they smell like grilled lamb and drakkar noir  what are you doing here  come to check up on me  golly no  i suppose you want to know what time i got home  no i do not i trust you implicitly   300 am  what are you talking about  your car pulled in the driveway at 1030  and you were lights out by 1115  you were spying on me  no  i gave the old lady across the street 20 bucks to do it  shes got her own nightvision goggles  i cant live like this  if this ring is a tracking device  then i dont want it  mom  whats going on  oh everybody needs an update  heres the headline  im giving this sneaky little weasel his walking papers  mom what has gotten into you  nobodys gotten into me  now if officer copasquat is done warming my toilet seat  id like to take a shower and get on with my new life  i lit a candle  hey you snoopy old witch  you want to spy on me  spy on this  god i hope its just her ass  i hate to say it  but if this behavior continues  we should really consider putting mom in a nursing home  victoria  im talking about a nice one with activities and a pool  that way when we visit her in the summer  we can lay out and tan  actually i was thinking we could just take her out tonight  have a few drinks see whats going on  smart  get her drunk so shell sign the power of attorney papers  and climb into the back of the senior shuttle on her own  hey  hey sweetie  your mom and vince make up yet  nope she called him and told him to come and pick up  his kimono and boner pills  ugh you see that combination coming down the stairs one time  youll be seeing it in your dreams  again thanks for covering my eyes  its too bad he and your mom cant work this out  well communications the key  thats the only way a relationship can survive  couldnt have put it better myself  you know if theres ever anything bothering you  you can always tell me  insecurities phobias whatever  good to know  im only asking cause im starting to think the idea  of flying somewhere on our honeymoon is spooking you  spooking me  im a chicago police officer  were known far and wide as the unspookables  where you going  im gonna lay down im feeling a little woozy  i dont think youre going to paris  not unless i can get big clammy in a kayak  this is fun  three flynn gals out for a night on the town  why dont we do this more often  because its cheaper to get drunk at home  and mom can take her pants off  right right  did you hear that mom  yeah i heard it  sorry about you and vince  me too  thanks  you doing okay  yep  just want to have a quiet drink and not talk about it  fine by me  so heres a funny thing  uh mike the big lug  is completely panicstricken to get on an airplane  oh my god what have i done  mom its okay  im a terrible person  no youre not  being engaged to one guy and sleeping with another guy  doesnt make you a terrible person  it just makes you a slutty person  what are you talking about  i didnt sleep with richard  he wanted me to but i told him i was engaged  so wait nothing happened  i kissed him okay  on the winky  what  no not on the winky  what kind of woman do you think your mother is  sorry i just assumed it was hereditary  so thats it  just a kiss nothing else  okay  you want all the dirty details  absolutely  sure  we kissed there was a little tongue  and maybe a few seconds of  overthesweater good morning tokyo  i dont know what that is  old men like to fiddle with your boobs like its a radio  well thats more disturbing than cheating  yeah i never count over the sweater  you never count under the skirt  hand no  head yes  the point is i kissed another man  so i got no business being engaged to vince  more to the point you stopped kissing another man  because youre engaged to vince  yeah that makes you practically superwoman  once i got a fellas tongue in my mouth its on till dawn  i did stop myself didnt i  mmhmm  of course his combover  and man girdle helped influence my decision  well  whatever it takes  but you did the right thing you should be proud of yourself  i guess the thing to do now is to tell vince   no no  no  you out of your mind  you take that to your grave  keep talking crazy like that were gonna put you in a home  a nice one with a pool  you know i dont understand what youre so afraid of  air travel is the safest form of transportation  and i dont understand why you flap your arms and scream like  a little girl when you see a spider the size of a pinto bean  oh i love carls  itsy bitsy spider dance  for your information flapping your arms and making loud noises  is how you scare those nasty bastards away  you are thinking of grizzly bears  spiders you just flick off the table or casually step on  that doesnt always work  theyll hide in the crevice of your shoe  crawl up your pant leg and lay eggs in your ear  just  id rather have a tarantula hotel in my head  than be hurled through the air in chittychitty crashcrash  my big fear is nuns and clowns  and one time i saw a clown dressed as a nun  nearly soiled my dashiki  oh man a clown dressed as a nun  thats like a fever dream  more like a wrong turn on gay pride day  and if you add hot pants and roller skates to that picture  you will sleep with the lights on for the rest of your life  all right nothing left to remember me by  but a hair dye stain on her pillow and enough dna  on the bedspread to clone an army of morantos  well uh best of luck vince  im really gonna miss you around here  i guess this means i wont be attending your wedding  but at least one of us  will get to stick his flag in a flynn girl  im sorry it didnt work out  no more words  just hold me you big bastard  oh vince youre still here  on my way out  and once you spray a little zout on the pillowcase  i am but a distant memory  i got something i need to tell you  and im not gonna feel right until i do  mom what are you doing  just being honest with the man  let me have it  i care about you very much and i never want to hurt you  where are you going with this   i got it  okay  you deserve to know the truth  and i cant go on living with this  mom shh  vincent moranto  i want you to come live with me  what  were engaged  theres absolutely no one else im interested in  plus your waterbed makes me nauseous  hey in 88 that was top of the line  cost me 600 bucks  yeah well it makes my ass sweat  and it smells like grilled lamb  why didnt you tell me you hated it  we shouldnt have secrets  what else arent you telling me  thats it nothing nothing  why dont we go upstairs and unpack your things  whatever you say my angel  clean up after youre done  i dont like waking up to a mess  you want to tell me what really went on with your mom  yeah you heard her  she wants him to live here  and we think its great  mmhmm  we do  yeah we do mm  listen i think we need to talk about our honeymoon  okay what are you thinking  a dude ranch where we cook our own cow  no  although wilbur wyoming is a beautiful slice of heaven  mike i dont care where we go  only thing i care about is that were together  well ive heard paris is lovely in the springtime  paris france  you know we cant drive there  i know  its a pretty long flight  i get it  in an airplane  stop talking about it  i feel like i got spiders in my ears  aw baby youre the greatest  kimono boner  listen im making sardines on toast  any takers  were good  maybe we should keep that paris money  and start saving for a place of our own  or at least buy him a longer robe
