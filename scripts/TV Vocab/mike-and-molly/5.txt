horizons  so molly took me to the symphony last night  wait a second you went to the symphony  yeah it was lovely very classy very elegant  so you fell asleep  almost immediately  i did fart myself awake a couple of times  but for the most part out like a light  look at you  sleeping at the symphony  well ladida  afterwards molly and i went out for a spot of tea  hang on a second youre drinking tea now  oolong  its a antioxidant  and whats that  i assume its something  that is against oxidants  also tastes like a cup of hot ass  wow this woman is giving you  a complete makeover isnt she  what are you talking about  going to the symphony drinking tea  next thing you know youll be carrying her purse  and asking permission to visit your balls on the weekend  hang on a second are you saying im whipped  because i am not whipped  i am still very much my own man  okay now let me ask if you dont say that does she hit ya  its not like that carl  in fact were not even seeing each other tonight  good for you its important  that a man to maintain his identity  i agree  i told her i needed this evening to myself  she understood so shes gonna meet us later for lunch  thats why youre wearing that cologne isnt it  maybe  figures  god forbid you should smell nice for me once in a while   for the first time in my life    i see love    whats the soup today  its pea soup ooh i love pea soup  ah ah ah you know thats loaded with salt and fat  come on ive been doing really good  because im the one thats been standing guard  over your pie hole  for him pea soup aint nothing  but a ham

colonel sanders  it hasnt been easy trust me  do you remember the day in november  well id have to check my diary  he makes everything a joke  thinks it hides his insecurity  it was the eighth  our first day as partners was november the eighth  there you go five years november the eighth  well congratulations you two  what the anniversary on this  i think its wood  please dont give me wood carl  how can you not remember that day  we had seven inches of snow  you slipped on the ice almost flattened a small dog  fine november the eighth  what do you want me to do tattoo it on my forehead  mmmmm tattoo it on your eating hand  that way youll be sure to remember it  always got to play the fat card huh  i play the hand im dealt  wow you guys sound just like an old married couple  what what are you talking about  you know the way you do the little back and forth  bickering thing that you do  oh thats not bickering thats just two guys  busting each others stones  male camaraderie like batman and robin  right im batman hes robin  who you calling robin im batman  no no  i have always been batman  i drive the car im batman  i let you drive the car because im the senior officer  that makes me batman  no no you let me drive the car  so you can take one of your little bat naps  see you said it im batman  dont twist my words  im not twisting your words im just stating a fact  this is about the soup isnt it i just wanted one bowl  youve never had one bowl of anything in your life  that was great huh  molly just gets cuter everyday  you both do  you guys seem to really have something special  you can see it right  i mean its palpable  palpable  you know obvious evident tangible  since when did you become big word bob  molly gave me one of those wordaday calendars  its fun yesterday i used malicious  no you were trying to say delicious  but you had food in your mouth  still counts  look im happy that youre learning new words  and falling asleep at fancy places  but i dont think we should have lunch  with your girlfriend anymore  why not  because we are paid to serve and protect  the good citizens of chicago so  so even when were having lunch were on duty  i mean what if a couple of cophating gang bangers  had walked by and started shooting  carl the only time weve ever been fired at  is when we get egged on halloween  so do you want to see your little school teacher  to take a grade a double yolk to the back of her head  no  course you dont  that stings like a bitch  all right i hear what youre saying  but you sure its not  because youre a little jealous of me and molly  what im not even gonna dignify that  sorry  i have been nothing but supportive  of you and your relationship with molly  again sorry  you are forgiven  by the way the next time you bring up being senior officer  im bringing up fitness reports  well see whos batman and whos robin  yeah i had a great day too  the highlight of course being lunch with you  no i mean it  one might say it was  the pinnacle of my day  so what are you doing right now  me  nothing carl came over  were gonna watch the game  no its not the bears  if it was the bears i wouldnt be on the phone with you  sit down what are you waiting for  no i was talking to carl  molly says to tell you hello  hi molly  carl sends his warmest salutations  carl you mind im on the phone  what are you doing  what are you doing  i came over to watch a football game  not watch you talk on the phone  i should probably go  robins in a mood  what is your problem  i dont have a problem  got you some hot wings  thank you

she called to ask you to come over  no  i mean the subject did come up  but i of course told her that you and i already had plans  and what kind of friend would i be if i blew those off  oh yeah i
