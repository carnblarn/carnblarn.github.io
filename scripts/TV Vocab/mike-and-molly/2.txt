from a man who lives with his grandma  one youre very interested in what she has to say  so interject the words uhhuh and really  as often as possible  trust me you cant say it too much  really uhhuh  two make her think youre tortured  equal parts good and evil  and theres no telling which sides gonna win  create an illusion of danger  exactly  bad boys get all the yumyum  and three  and most important make her think that you can have sex  whenever you want with whoever you want  and whatever happens with her is no big deal  well how do you do that  its kind of a zen thing  you got to look at reality as an illusion see  therefore you want nothing and you need nothing  it also helps to masturbate about two or three times  before you leave the house  thank you  very helpful  im a fountain
