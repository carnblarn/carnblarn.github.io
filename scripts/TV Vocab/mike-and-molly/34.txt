                1 now i understand why theres so many songs written about love  it truly is all you need and what makes the world go round  yeah i know carl i have a radio too  but have you really listened to those songs  for me its like my eyes and ears are open  for the first time  well your mouth couldnt go it alone forever  colors look brighter air smells fresher  and i find myself smiling at strangers  for no reason at all  have a good day citizen  every single one is precious  wow did you finally spend the night with your girlfriend  or did the lady in dispatch wear  the white sweater with the red bra  hey dont drag it through the gutter  christinas a smart beautiful woman  and we have a real connection  you take your time with a gal like that  you got to build up a trust  before you make her ride the freak train to nastytown  my apologies  but usually at this point in your relationships  youve already broken up with the woman  and made out with her sister  its true that in the past ive been somewhat of a  rascally opportunist but  since ive met christina  ive gone through an emotional growth spurt  ah i see so youre still full of crap  but now its a whole different kind of crap  a more mature crap  a worldly crap  hey samuel my good man  hows your morning going so far  well the heat went out at my apartment at 400 this morning  and i was awakened by the sound of my chattering teeth  then when i got to work i slipped  on a piece of canadian bacon and pulled a hamstring  what im hearing is he got to see the sun rise  his other leg is fine and hes got a strong set of teeth  hey what are you and molly doing this weekend  maybe the four of us could double  you know nice dinner catch a movie  well were not eating out much now  cause were trying to save money for the wedding  maybe you and christina could just come over   and have dinner at the house  oh great idea  that way she can see you and molly blissfully cohabitating  and how comfortable i am in a domestic setting  plus it saves us about 80 bucks apiece  and i dont have to leave the house or put on hard shoes  winwin  you know what  it really is a beautiful day  for the first time in my life   i see love    victoria we are not inviting your pot dealer to my wedding  well its gonna be awkward if i dont ask him  cause i see him like every other day  he can come to the reception though right  we definitely want him at the reception  yeah i mean why should it just be  the happiest day of your life  come on you guys  i cant make any other wedding plans  until we get this guest list done  you know  this is gonna be the first real wedding in the family  your daddy and i just had a quickie civil ceremony   on his lunch hour  i know mom  based on the timeline im pretty sure i was there  how come molly got to go and i didnt   evening ladies  hi mike  hey hon did you have a good day  ive been riding around with a lovestruck carl  whos decided to replace speeding tickets  with friendly warning hugs  on the plus side i think thats actually a better deterrent  aw i am so happy carl found somebody  do you know if hes bringing her to the wedding  well it is six months away  thats a lot of time and a lot of carl  hey listen about that guest list  we really need to lock down a number  so we can put a deposit down on a reception hall  yeah i know sweetie ill get on it  oh by the way carl and his girlfriend  are coming over for dinner on saturday night  no uh saturday night  i cant do anything i have book reports to grade  and laundry wedding stuff  well just blow off the laundry and the wedding stuff  give yourself a break  youre starting to look kind of stressed  dont kill him you love him  youd like to kill him but you cant  cause you love him  look at us  you and your fiance are having  me and my girlfriend over for dinner  are we civilized or what  weve come a long way from spending our weekends  in strip clubs eating complimentary taquitos  and watching a girl pick up dollar bills  with her sweaty butt cheeks  yeah  not to denigrate those experiences  cause those were special times  in their own way chuckles  plus we wouldnt be who we are if we hadnt gone through them  exactly we wouldnt appreciate what we have now  youre marrying a school teacher and im dating a doctor  not bad for a chubby guy and a pervert  right  hey guess what christina and i are doing this evening  were going shopping for a bottle of wine  to bring to your place  well i think mollys preparing salmon fillets  so perhaps a fruity chablis is in order  mm indubitably  oh and by the way my lady has a bit of a nut allergy  like peanuts or no your fatty nuts  uh cashews your hazelnuts your pistachios  very well ill inform the chef  aint this something  buying wine planning menus  its a far cry from you nursing a ninedollar dr pepper  while some stripper lifts my wallet  during a socalled blindfold dance  not that those werent good times  wouldnt trade em for the world  mike mom please can we just  get this guest list done now what about aunt sis  is she on your invite her but dont sit her next to me pile  or your rot in hell pile  shes good to go but that beerbellied husband of hers  can keep his dead tooth and his grabby hands at home  really i always liked uncle ferrell  thats because you never had to slow dance with that sob  he turns your back from the crowd  and goes at your butt cheeks  like hes trying to open an oyster  well okay what about their kids  dougie and mary ellen  you mean druggie and butch  hell be high as a kite and shell be in the mens room  trying to straddle a urinal  how about from your church  anybody there you can stand the sight of  why do we have to do the invitations now  the wedding aint for months  its not just for the invitations its for  chairs and how many forks we need  i dont know its a big deal to molly  boy when she cracks her whip  you just pull your panties down and take it dont you  mom can we please just get this over with  now what about the ladies in your bible study group  ah those holierthanthou hags hate me i dont know why  im a good christian i turn the other cheek  which they can pucker up and kiss  oh   hey honey  hey  vince and i were just talking and we really think  a double wedding is the way to go  no kidding  since were gonna be all dressed up anyway  the i dos become we dos alakazam  twice the romance half the cost  alakazam indeed  we could probably get a great package deal  on a honeymoon too  you thinkin what im thinkin  im guessing its not help molly with the groceries  princess cruise  bingo  its like a floating las vegas great shows  wonderful buffets and once youre in  international waters going topless  is practically mandatory  once in a blue moon you get seasick and yak  but its all you can eat so youre not really  losing any money  well let me think about it  oh um no  we planted the seed just let it grow  hey sweetie  hey   would you help me put these groceries away  sure  for tomorrow night im gonna make a nice salmon  with a dill sauce and vegetables and a rice pilaf  hopefully they will look like those things  and taste like those things  wow youre something else  how did a guy like me ever get a gal like you  i dont know but dont blow your last two wishes  on pizza and beer  hey did you and your mom finish your guest list  well moms still kind of working on hers  and i think im just gonna hang a signup sheet  down at the precinct  signup sheet why dont you just stick flyers  under peoples windshield wipers  thats kind of impersonal  at this rate were gonna lose our reception hall  if we dont give them a head count or a deposit  honey relax youre starting to make yourself  and everybody else a little crazy  oh  so you think i might be overthinking it a little  well we do have six months  you know i planned my super bowl party in four hours  and that included two tvs and seven kinds of dip  wow seven kinds of dip thats  i didnt realize i was marrying such an expert party planner  the key is not to micromanage  you do what you can you delegate the rest  thats why i put carl in charge of three of those dips  mm oh yeah  well maybe he can help you with the catering  and the florist and oh and the reception hall  what do you mean i think youre right  yeah im gonna just delegate this stuff  now i dont want to be planning it all by myself  and driving people crazy  so im gonna leave it to an expert  i wouldnt say im an expert  you know i am i am feeling so much more relaxed already  will you put those groceries away for me  im gonna go take a bath  wait i have to plan a wedding now  ill see you in six months  ill be the one in the white dress  seven dips  thats impressive  mom you gotta quit changing your mind  about the guest list yes i realize  all your friends are twofaced turds  just give me a number cause youre killing me  sweetly all right mom thanks  yes i know its gonna be a beautiful wedding  yes i am a lucky guy bye  listen youd better get dressed  carl and christina are gonna be here in a few minutes  im still expecting calls from a couple of bakeries  i bumped up the cake tasting  i actually drew up a little chart with elimination brackets  like they do with the final four  red velvet and mocha chip are the top two seeds  hey remember dont overthink it  youll just make everybody crazy   this wine is delicious  it ought to be it cost 35  carl  what sometimes the flavor is enhanced if  you know its pricey theyve done studies  hes right i pawned generic ice cream off  on mike before telling him it was haagendazs  well lets be honest  that man has never met a bowl of ice cream he didnt like  give him something white and frozen hell give it a lick  i appreciate you making dinner for us tonight  im sure youre swamped with work and wedding plans  it has been a little crazy  but mikes actually been helping out quite a bit  good for you when i was planning my wedding  my exhusband didnt want to have anything to do  with the decision making  some men cant handle it  see me i got a decisive nature  you show me two things im going to pick one  hey you guys  sorry to keep you waiting its okay sweetie  i was just singing your praises  she was i think its great  that youre helping out with the wedding plans  its too much work for one person  believe me i know  and thats why i say we forget all the wedding planning  and just elope  what  why blow a ton of money on a stupid ceremony  when its driving us both crazy  so just forget all the work ive already put in  and get married at the courthouse  exactly and we dont have to wait six months  we can do it tomorrow  and since im a civil employee they said theres no waiting  see no more blowing time or money on something nobody wants  uh excuse me  im uh im going to go check on the salmon  she must be going to the lake  stay here ill go talk to her  man you dont know a thing about women  hes been in charge of our wedding for exactly 16 hours  and his one big idea is lets not have a wedding  well its a sign of how much you love him  that you actually thought he was gonna be helpful in the first place  i never thought id be one of those people  who would care so much about a wedding but i do  well i wanted one since i was a little girl  every saturday  id make my little brother pretend to marry me in the backyard  my dad tells everybody thats why hes gay now  isnt it silly that i want him to be as excited about it as i am  no  a little unrealistic but not silly  my exhusband and i must have broken up at least four times  when we were planning our wedding  wow and you still went through with it  well the invitations had gone out the band was booked  and my brother had been rehearsing over the rainbow for months  i dont know maybe hes right  i mean maybe we should just do it quick and get it over with  is that really what you want  no  i want a real wedding  the gown and the flowers  and relatives getting drunk and saying weird things to each other  i guess im oldfashioned  well then you need to tell him that  i have told him  youve turned off the tv looked him in the eye  and said i want a traditional oldfashioned wedding  not those exact words  then honey this is on you  subtlety and nuance are like the metric system to men  you need to tell him exactly what you want  and then make him repeat it back to you  maybe have him write it on his hand  there you go  i was just trying to make it easier on her  all the planning was driving her crazy  so take away all the planning seemed logical to me  women dont live in a logical world  man dont just gulp that down thats 125 a sip  you know i probably shouldnt  have just sprung it on her like that  it was astonishingly insensitive on your part  and as your best man i too was a little blindsided  but did i run out of the house crying no i did not  i kept my pain inside  i appreciate that  i mean that days important to me too  i already got my speech written and half memorized  am i tasting hazelnuts  i dont know  screaming screaming  carl oh my god  carl i think i need to go to the emergency room   i told you no nuts  ive had a lot on my mind  ive been planning a wedding  can we discuss this in the car my throats kind of closing up  ill drive ill drive  oh god  we are going to the hospital now so christina doesnt die  no no you get the coats ill cork the wine  come on all right  just  the nurse said shes going to be fine  they gave her a shot of epinephrine  ah good yeah  carls never going to let me forget this one  well you can understand him being a little peeved  i mean his girlfriends tongue blew up like a life raft  scary wasnt it  it looked like she was coughing up a ham loaf  i guess i messed up everybodys night huh  well you hurt my feelings mike  i thought our wedding was important to both of us  and it would be fun for us to plan it together  but you werent having any fun  because i was doing it all by myself  the reason im marrying you is cause i actually like doing things with you  we do have a good time together dont we  mostly  im sorry  from now on im with you every step of the way  were going to plan our special day together  look me in the eye and say that again  doctor says she doesnt have to stay overnight   so itll just be a few more minutes  good  carl im so sorry i feel awful ah  it was certainly negligent on your part  but on the plus side im scoring some big points in there  just by holding her hand and telling her she still looks beautiful to me  sweet  tell me about it  the woman looked like apollo creed at the end of rocky ii  all right i better hop back in there  theyre getting ready to shoot some more steroids into her supple little behind  and uh i dont want to miss that  ooh  see you could have done a lot worse  well whod have thunk it  im sorry tonight went down the way it did  but im hoping youll give me another chance  of course  i mean im sure your friends  didnt intentionally try to kill me  im going to stay on their good side just in case  speaking of which  mikes really been riding me about a head count for the wedding  and i dont want to push you or anything  just need to let him know if im going to be a plus one or not  thats a long way off its not binding  no contract involved  i would love to be your date  thats great  and listen ill hammer home the whole nut thing  so you can relax and eat whatever you want at the reception  ill carry a sandwich around in my pocket i dont care  appreciate it  good night  good night  carl mcmillan plus one
