                1 am i moving your stuff to my place all alone or are you gonna help me  im helping im packing memories  you know im actually five pounds lighter  than i was in high school  do you know that none of your glasses actually match  i dont even know how a person does that  hey same haircut you ask  same barber i say  clears throat  well i have plenty of glassware at my place  so well just donate this stuff to goodwill  whoa hang on you realize some of those are collectables  really and which is the higher  ticket item bambam or mayor mccheese  mccheese of course  i think that ones still good for one free refill  all right well keep this one and the sammy sosa travel mug  and my cereal bowl  holds the perfect serving size  plus you can wash a baby in it yeah  dont worry i already packed your cereal bowl  now what are we gonna do with your tv  well you dont have a tv in your bedroom  nah i dont really like having a tv in the bedroom  you know who says that  people who have never had a tv in their bedroom  or people who like to read or talk  fine but while youre reading or talking  what am i supposed to do  i dont know digging through your belly button seems  to take up a lot of your time  so the only place to watch tv will be downstairs in the lobby  in my house we call that the living room  yeah but  your mom and your sister are down there  so ill have to put on pants  if im gonna put on pants  i might as well go to the movies  alright you can put the tv in the bedroom  thanks  but if i ever walk in wearing a sexy nightie  and any other body part that looks like it  that means i can screw up 11 times  for the first time in my life   i see love    so mollys belongings are precious gold  but you got to hide your worthless crap in my garage  im not hiding it  then ill sneak it in one box at a time  wonderful  lies and deception  the mortar that holds the bricks of love together  it worked for you and dad  those were simpler times  what happened to my air hockey game  you know mikey  im not one to cast judgment  on how other people choose to live their lives  here we go  but rushing to move in with this woman  is a horrible mistake  that youll regret the rest of your life  well dont sugarcoat it mom how do you really feel  hey what happened to all my gi joe stuff  in my day we didnt shack up with somebody  until we had rings on our fingers and rice in our hair  listen molly and i love each other  and getting rid of my apartment  is a good way for us to save money  well if you really wanted to save money  you never should have moved out of this house  yes but that would have ended in a murdersuicide  fine  but when she gets tired  of peeling your dirty drawers off the floor  you always got three hots and a cot here with me and jim  and s all the incentive i need to make it work  seriously i cant find my stretch armstrong  my baseball cards nothing  hey i had a garage sale okay  and you sold my stuff  well if you dont sprinkle in a few toys  it just looks like a sad old shutin  having a predeath estate sale  oh man  and if the guy across the street ever asks  you never wore that orange swimsuit  i promised him no plums in the basket  molly okay  i made room for some of mikes stuff in the hall closet  im gonna take these things over to goodwill  dont you dare  those are your dads clothes  you cant give those away  mom he died 25 years ago  and this leisure suit passed away ten years before that  i dont care youre not giving them away  oh it still smells like daddy  hai karate and hot sauce  its gonna be so weird having another man living here  by the way i was wondering if you guys could clear  a little space for him in the bathroom  ooh that big man in our little bathroom  yipes  dont worry all hes got is a razor and a toothbrush  and for some mysterious reason a shower cap  its not about counter space  were worried about the beating that toilets gonna take  mom  why dont we make him use the downstairs bathroom  like we did with dad  there you go  just throw in a good industrialstrength plunger  and a big scented candle  citronella like they use at campsites  or we could just rent one of those porta potties  and put it in the backyard  good idea  then it becomes the neighbors problem  all right this is the last of it  we got a dreamsicle  and what is either a frozen tamale  or a pair of yellow dress socks  i will have the dreamsicle  ill spin the wheel on that tamale  good luck cause it was here when i moved in  so what are you doing with this sofa  i tried to give it to goodwill but apparently  they have a too many stains policy  im surprised they took your shirts  samuel its yours if you want it  uh thank you but my roommates and i have more  of a southwestern motif  you know  now that youre moving in with molly  we wont be able to hang out like this anymore  what are you talking about  you guys can come over there  its gonna be my place as much as it is hers  hmm yeah thats what those indians thought  when they waved at that first boatload of pilgrims  exactly  no more spearing fish and peeing in the woods  its tea cakes and bible lessons for you  what the hell are you talking about  those women are gonna civilize you  no more fingers up your nose no hands down your pants  and forget about sitting on the couch  drinking from a can of pork and beans  please carl im not an animal  ive lived indoors before  carl really  you want to lift these couch cushions  and play food filth or fungi  microwave bell dings  carl tamale  frozen plantain  ill eat that  see doesnt take up a lot of space  and it fits in with all your asian decor  samsung  hilarious  what are we gonna do with this  good question  where do you keep your bobbleheads  well i only have the one  and right now hes putting a tv in my bedroom  its cute  at my place he sat next to my computer  oh well here hell live in the garage  do you like that  he does like that  the garage this guy is a hall of famer  and won 20 games six years in a row  this is not the actual guy  fine sure seems like  a lot of my stuffs being relegated to the garage  all right ill find a place for this little fella  great and since youre loosening the reins  on the sports memorabilia  lets find a spot for this ebay treasure  gosh were running tight on wall space  uh what about downstairs bathroom  fergie jenkins in the garage  gale sayers in the crapper  i dont think youre really from chicago lady  well i know that this is tough but come here  but its just temporary  soon well have our own place  thats not mine not yours but ours  i guess  and well have so much room  youll be able to have your own den  really oh yeah  you can put all your stuff in there  thatll be cool right  like a man

youre meaner now that we live together  whoa there he is  morning victoria  you just getting home  yeah i had a little car trouble  maybe i can help  im not a mechanic but i know whats what under the hood  this is actually more  of a too stoned to remember where i parked problem  well as a sworn police officer  i cannot comment but i commend you  for not driving a motor vehicle  while under the influence  wasnt really my choice  but thank you for not harshing my mellow  no problem  and for the record  johnny law  pow pow pow pow pow  and im walking the line  molly you up yet  aw out  oh look

theres anything you ever need done  just let me know  i want to earn my keep  were talking chores right  not some sort of plus sized gigolo action  no  im pulling your leg hoss  oh  if youre serious about helping out  a couple of those kitchen cabinets could use new hinges  ill take care of that today  we could also use a new screen for the back door  victoria walks through at least one a year  consider it done  and a new exhaust hose for the dryer  easy to do  oh and the pulsating shower wand upstairs  has seen better days  three women in the house dont ask  wasnt planning on it  pounding loudly  whats that pounding  your boyfriend is up on the roof  replacing the loose shingles  okay so it wasnt santa claus  but you can understand what got me there right  the poor guys only been here one night  and youre putting him to work  he volunteered  mike biggs volunteered to climb up on the roof  and start relaying shingles  he was reluctant at first but i promised him a pan of brownies  and he shimmied up that ladder like his ass was on fire  mom we shouldnt take advantage  of mikes good nature  some might say his jolly nature  you know hes been working hard  we should make him a nice dinner tonight  thats a great idea  remember our sunday night dinners with daddy  well make pot roast  mashed potatoes and banana cream pie  daddys favorite  oh its not mikes favorite  who the hells talking about mike  im telling you carl all i did was put  a couple screws in a cabinet door  and her mom made me french toast  i know i feel like king midas  not the muffler guy  you got to get a library card  hang on i got to earn myself some brownies  joyce hey how you doing up there  you working hard  oh yeah  seeing you up there blocking the sun  reminds me of when my husband was alive  he was always working on the roof  well chicago winters lots of wear and tear  i may be up here for a while  you hungry  you want a sandwich  oh id love a salami and cheese  too bad he loved peppers and meatballs  incoming  thatll work  cant talk now carl this is a twohand job  anything look familiar  the stop signs do  but i think they use the same ones all over town  all right where is the last

get mike to help me look  my fianc is not your personal lo jack  besides mom probably has him planting corn by now  all i know is hes a lot more patient  and understanding than you  thats because he hasnt played carandseek  every sunday since you got your learners permit  can we at least assume its still in illinois  you know when i told mike about misplacing my car  he was not mean or judgmental  mmmm no he was firm but fair just like daddy  victoria focus  anything around here ring a bell  bars restaurants  maybe one of your shoes laying in the road  both shoes are accounted for  but keep your eyes peeled for a hair scrunchie  and a black laced bra  all right im done  okay well just wait for your car  to get booted and towed like last time  no last time we drove around  i eventually remembered i parked it in the garage  oh wait  no  im sorry im sorry no  you have got yourself a real prize there young lady  i know mom hes a great guy  hes more than a great guy  he does whatever i ask him to do  and eats whatever i toss up on the roof  its like having a big pet raccoon that can fix stuff  oh  theres my  hardworking man  nice fit huh two more pockets and im a pool table  mike why why are you wearing my dads clothes  oh i gave him a bunch of daddys stuff  you know the last time he wore this suit  we were sharing a j at a doobie brothers concert  or sharing a doobie at an ojays concert i forget  it was the doobie brothers  i found the ticket stubs and an ancient tootsie roll  oh daddy loved his tootsie rolls  can i see it  well the real memory is the ticket stubs right  im kind of freaking out here  mike you dont have to wear that  why i think i look pretty good in it  you look like you should be standing in a field  selling green beans  never mind her you look
