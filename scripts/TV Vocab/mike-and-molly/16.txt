                1 yeah i ordered the heartshaped cake  with happy valentines day molly spelled out in red hots  when will that be ready  perfect ill be by later to pick that up  you know normally they do the wording  with little icing flowerets but my lady likey the red hots  oh thats right its mikey that likey the mike  ikees  im taking her to her favorite restaurant  followed by a carriage ride down michigan avenue  then back to her place for dessert and champagne  carriage ride  with that cold wind blowing off the lake  man you aint gonna see your testicles  till about late march early april  the nip in the air promotes snuggling  plus im bringing thermal underwear and ski masks  mm sounds sexy  like two cat burglars in the worst getaway vehicle ever  hey i thought youd be happy for me  ive finally got a girlfriend  i can do something special with on valentines day  oh so youre saying last year wasnt special  you mean drinking beer with you at that offtrack betting place  it was one of the most depressing nights of my life  thats because none of your dogs came in  you got to look at the animals pedigree and study its behavior  you dont just throw ten bucks at a dog because his name is scoobydont  chuckles scoobydont  and anyway dont worry about me  ive got plans of my own tomorrow night  you got a date  something better than a date  i got a strategy  oh this isnt the walking into the ladies room  pretending to be blind thing again is it  that was an accident one door had a picture of a palm tree  and the other one had two coconuts  and we both know two coconuts can go either way  so uh what kind of strategy are you talking about  well women have very high expectations on valentines day true  thats true and that puts a lot  of pressure on the man which usually results  in an argument andor an ugly breakup  oh no  so right about 1030 the streets are gonna be lined  with a bunch of brokenhearted bitches looking for a ride home  let me understand this  youre gonna cruise around the city  looking for sad stranded women  you are ghoulish  ghoulish like a fox  for the first time in my life   i see love    mmm these are delicious  now who are they from  gary the channel nine weekend weatherman  the guy with the bad rug  you know he even wears that thing in bed  i woke up one morning and it was stuck to my crotch  kind of liked it  it was very retro  molly hey  hey sweetie  how was your day  they served chili in the school cafeteria  so my afternoon was pretty much one long debate  about who smelt it and who dealt it  another package for miss victoria flynn  whos it from  uh no return address  just a picture of a smiley face smoking a joint  you know what they say  candy is dandy but yay weed  aw look at this mike made me a valentine  through wind or sleet or rain or shine  i will always be your valentine  soon as i heard shine i knew exactly where he was headed  oh look he made it out of construction paper  and cut out little letters and glued them on  looks kind of like a ransom note doesnt it  if he didnt sign it id be pretty spooked  isnt that sweet  he wants tomorrow to be perfect  vince is doing the same thing  he booked us a suite at the sybaris adult motel  really  from 630 to midnight  hes out right now buying extra chlorine  for the jacuzzi  mike and i are going to dinner  and then were taking a nice romantic carriage ride  down michigan avenue  oh vince doesnt like carriage rides  he says a visible horse anus is a boner killer  sure  gary the weatherman has the same problem  with midgets and schnauzers  thats why we can ever do it at the circus or the dog park  sure  well i guess the upside  we all have dates on valentines day  oh yeah i mean these are highclass problems  this is her favorite bakery  and she has no idea that i know about it howd you find out  we drove by once and she said thats my favorite bakery  look at you listening to a woman  youre gonna make detective yet  gentlemen how can i help you  yes im here to pick up a cake  that i specialordered for my girlfriend for valentines day  all right i think everybody heard that  your last name  biggs two gs  and he has a girlfriend  ill be right back  help yourself to a sample of our maple bars  man there was a time where i wouldve walked in here  with a gallon of milk and a credit card  and not stopped till i hit drywall  im proud of you  youre showing willpower and restraint  right its been a long time since we pulled over  a little debbie truck for expired tags  all right mr biggs with two gs  we have a chocolate cake with vanilla butter cream frosting  oh thats gorgeous  you sir are a pastry magician  mmm i second that emotion  this is like a bear claw and an angel food cake  had a sweet tasty baby  laughs  well thank you  happy valentines day molly  its perfect had to go  to a gas station to buy the red hots  but i think it came out pretty nice  red hots rattle  sounds like we might have enough left over  to spell out flynn  ah well wait a second  this cake is for molly flynn  uhhuh  oh of course  youre mike the cop  i cant believe this im kyle  kyle yeah  oh kyle the baker  this is carl the other cop  nice to meet you you too and  i couldnt be happier for you and molly  i still consider her one of the best things to ever happen to me  even though it didnt work out between us  chuckles softly  right  im sure mollys already talked your ear off  about me backing out of our wedding  wedding shut up carl let the man tell his story  water under the bridge  the important thing is the two of you found each other  uhhuh  what do i owe you for the cake  you know what its on me  consider it my valentines present  to you and molly  thank you thats very generous  carry the cake my knees are starting to buckle  should we grab a couple of maple bars for the road  get in the car  im such a chump  a big dumb trusting chump  jesus this is moist  so whats the big deal if she had  a boyfriend before she met you  uhuh not boyfriend fianc  big difference  they made a promise they exchanged iloveyous  im guessing they exchanged a lot more than that not helping  god this frosting just melts in your mouth  that son of a bitch  look im sure  she has a perfectly good reason for not telling you  about that man yeah like shes still in love with the guy  and im just the stupid rebound guy she kills time with  until they get back together  now youre just jumping to conclusions  without knowing all the facts  all right fact molly had a secret fianc  she never told me about  fact he still has feelings for her  fact he called off the wedding  so she still has feelings for him  not to mention he is ruggedly goodlooking  and in terrific shape  not helping  hey listen to me man you dont want to do this right now  youre angry and you got cake on your nose  hey i think a man deserves to know the truth  about the woman hes dating  well see thats where you and i differ  i dont want to know anything i dont want to know  that she did jail time has grandkids my age  or used to be named jerome wadlow iii  go wait in the car  youre gonna regret this man  i know what im doing  im just gonna talk to her calmly  and get this whole thing straightened out  hey mike  deceiver  what  when were you gonna tell me huh  when was i gonna find out about your dirty little secret  why dont you come inside and tell me what youre so upset about  oh youd love for me to come inside wouldnt you  maybe hang my coat up in your closet full of skeletons  is that cake in your ear  probably  its from your favorite bakery  i was gonna surprise you for valentines day  but little did i know id be getting the surprise  so you met kyle look im sorry  i didnt tell you about him but it was a long time ago  you were gonna stand at an altar  and promise to be with him forever  i cant even get you to join costco with me  well im not gonna give up my sams club membership  just to make you feel loved  and there it is done and done  happy valentines day molly flynn  mike get back in here and lets talk about this  whoa  are you okay  yeah im fine  nothing broken but my heart  and your sidewalk  shut up and start the car  door closes  car driving away  i was gonna give this to molly  with a little heartshaped chocolate  take it too many memories  wheres the chocolate  just take the stupid flower  and bring me a tall stack of blueberry pancakes  dont you move you ate a whole friggin cake yesterday  it was sugarfree  it was still five pounds of food  what difference does it make  you see the way that kyle guy was built  you could see his abs and he was wearing a smock  i cant compete with that  he was pretty cut plus he works in a bakery  thats a man with a lot of selfcontrol and discipline  and he was very personable too kind of a quiet dignity  well why dont you both marry him  hey i know youre hurting but i do not appreciate that tone  nor the implication of our homosexuality  what if this is just the tip of the iceberg  what if theres other stuff shes not telling me  have you told her everything about your past  full disclosure ive been an open book with that woman  did you tell her about that overweight singles cruise  if memory serves you did very well on that love barge  ill bet no one came knockin  when that boat was arockin  carl im just saying  everybody has something in their past  and you cant hold it against them thats true  one day a person can be a hired assassin  in the senegalese secret service  the next day hes being commanded  to fetch a fat cop his pancakes  thank you for the rose  molly mike its molly  again  uh look i understand that youre upset  but lets not blow this thing out of proportion  i love you  so quit acting like a big baby and call me back  hes still not taking your calls huh  guess im spending another valentines day by myself  although the janitor at school  did offer up a rather disturbing romantic scenario  hey listen lamb chop  i know im not your real dad  but i dont understand why you dont just tell mikey  your exfianc is a big fruit  mom you told him  vin and i discussed it yeah  cause we dont keep secrets from each other  unlike some people  oh really  im just saying  relationships are built on a foundation of trust  course that foundation better be rebarred  into a bedrock of hot nasty sex  thank you for the fatherly advice vince  hey ive lived ive loved  and with that comes a certain amount of wisdom  and crabs  allall right vin  no more sharing  listen believe it or not trying to explain to mike  that i almost married a gay man is a little humiliating for me  joyce sweetheart  you have nothing to be embarrassed about  you met kyle in college  you liked each other  he didnt even know he was gay yet  just out of curiosity howd you figure it out  you catch him trying on your panties  or did he just say boy i wish you had a wiener  this right here is why i dont like talking about it  molly you dont have anything to be ashamed of  other than the fact that i was so desperate  to have a boyfriend that i was willing  to overlook some pretty obvious clues  i mean mom he painted my toenails  while we watched sex and the city  well youll explain all this to mike  and you guys will be even closer  amen to that  and by the way offering to paint a ladys toes  doesnt necessarily make a guy a swish  vince fyi swish is no longer the politically correct term  homoamericans  there ya go  man i went to so much trouble  to make sure tonight was perfect  i know  i even snuck into her ipod  to see what kind of music she likes  so i could serenade her with one at a karaoke bar after dinner  whatd you come up with  you shook me all night long by acdc  molly likes heavy metal  no but it was the only thing in her ipod that didnt suck  i mean it is filled with whiny chick music  i had to pull the ear buds out before i got my period  michael what in the world are you doing here  i thought you were taking molly out for valentines day  yeah well that whole thing sort of fell apart nana  i thought i was the first man  that mollyd ever said i love you to  turns out shell say it to anybody  who can make a decent pie crust  i see  so you thought you were her prince charming  on a white horse  and now youre seeing other hoof prints in her yard  i bet theyre not as deep as yours  did anybody ask what do the stupid people think  no  no is right  so just sit there until we need a learned opinion  about drinking straight out of the milk jug  or what time the neighbor lady takes her bath  hey i was shoveling the driveway  and she left her blinds open  you need to find yourself a woman and get out of my house  now michael mollys a grown woman  and you cant get upset with her because shes got a past  i know that  i just didnt think her past included some hunky guy  thats in way better shape than i am  so this aint so much about molly  as it is about you feeling a little less than  maybe i mean how can i ever measure up to a guy like that  in your own way is how  and im guessing acting like a jackass  on valentines day aint helping your case  see you gotta ask yourself which one youd rather be  the man she used to love or the man she loves right now  thanks nana  chuckles  good luck out there carl  where you going  dont worry about it  i got a strategy  mmhmm  and if you walk into the ladies bathroom  at church again pretending to be blind  i will slap the black off of you  were closed  its mike the cop  mike  why arent you with molly  oh im with molly  and just so you know im gonna be with molly for a long time  good to hear it  is that what you came by to tell me  yes it is  oh and i need a cake  what happened to the other one  she ate it i didnt even get a bite  oh she ate the whole thing  look it doesnt matter who ate what or who didnt get a bite  i just need something to replace it  well what you see is what i got  most of the best stuff is already taken  thats right it is and dont you forget it  mollys with me now no takebacks  theres a new sheriff in town and his name is mike biggs  i know with two gs yeah  i might not be sporting a sixpack  or know how to make tiramisu  but shes my girlfriend now  and even if you change your mind and want her back  you cant have her  dont worry mike  im not gonna change my mind  you say that now  but you changed your mind about marrying her  whats to stop you from doing it again  im guessing the fact  that im gay might be a bit of a speed bump  im sorry bump gay what  im gay with two gs  molly didnt tell you that part  no she did not  but i try not to pry into her past  see our relationship is built on trust  well theres nobody more trustworthy  even after all i put her through  she went out of her way to stay friends with me  shes really a remarkable girl  of course im not telling you anything you dont already know  yeah  listen i gotta try to salvage whats left of tonight  how much for the heartshaped cookies  seven dollars  seven dollars its a frickin cookie  but its a really good frickin cookie  can i get three for 20  absolutely  gentle soulful music plays on tv  sighs  sniffles  sighs  ugh ugh coconut  that one doesnt count  intro to acdcs you shook me all night long playing  molly im sorry  it doesnt matter what happened in the past  because every single thing  made you the person that i love now  i love you too but youve been acting like a real jerk  youre absolutely right  how can i make it up to you  i dont know  but just stand there freezing your marbles off  while i think of something  fair enough  oh and youre gonna join sams club  they really dont have the inventory but okay  had me fighting for air   she told me to come but i was already there   distant cause the walls start shaking   the earth was quaking   my mind was aching   this is actually turning out  to be a really nice valentines day  i said you shook me all night long   you want a little more champagne  no thank you  well its chilled if you want it  how about another cookie  better not  i had one small bite out of about 140 chocolates earlier  tell me about it  i ate a whole cake yesterday  happy valentines day mike  happy valentines day molly  wind gusting oh  were rounding the corner  here comes the headwinds again  you shook me all night long   whimpering shuddering  knocking me out
