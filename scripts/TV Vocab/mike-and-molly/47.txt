trying to keep  my moms foot out of my dads ass  well this is my wedding  and that means that nobody gets to be crazier than me  looks like we might need to let this out just a smidge  no you wont i am just a few pounds  from my target weight  and i am going to drop those last six pounds  easy peasy lemon squeezy  those six pounds will be your bitch  remember not to stay in the saddle the whole time  move up and down and lift with your core  molly mike  listen you dont have to squeeze into  some wedding dress to look perfect to me  youre already the most beautiful woman in the world  i love

 and then a pillow over my head  and then wrapped the whole thing with duct tape  is dad still here  sacked out upstairs  im afraid i didnt let your pappy  get much shuteye last night  yeah it was about 200 am when i realized  the cotton balls werent enough and i didnt have  the stomach to cut off my ears  your dad and i never had any problems carnally  we could fight all day and settle it that night  buck naked between the sheets  you know thats how you got that tenspeed  whyd you have to tell me that  i loved that bike  hate is  a powerful aphrodisiac  people say never go to bed angry  they dont know what the hell theyre missing  look i dont know what you and dad  are doing but i just dont want to see you get hurt again  dont worry about me im pretty thickskinned  even though i come

but its gonna be fine  snafu thats dolly parton and yentl  having a hair baby  this is not what i wanted  i wanted to look beautiful  this is not beautiful  sweetie its gonna be fine  this is just a little speed bump  this is a 12car pileup  im surprised theres not a news chopper overhead  vince  hes right its horrible  i told them i wanted soft ringlets around my face  not a head full of curly fries  oh ooh  its not that bad  its just a little busy  and mike loves curly fries oh  didnt they try and fix it  this is the fix  i had to get her out of there  before they started adding sparklers  and little fake birds  somebody call mike and tell him hes marrying a circus clown  im gonna go put on my big red nose now  geez what a horrible night  the sound of my parents sweaty bodies slapping together  it was like satan clapping his hands  yeah when my grandma has brother heywood over  i just take a sleeping bag into the garage  and lay under the car  id rather wake up with a mouthful of oil  than hear that mess  i just dont need any more drama  i got enough on my mind today  well dont worry about christina and me  ive put that unrequited i love you incident behind me good  once you step in it dont try and dig it out of the treads  best to just throw the shoe out  agreed  and after the initial sting of public humiliation  i realized that these things have to move at their own pace  let it unfold naturally mmhmm so today  when i ask her to marry me  she has no choice but to say i love you  what  ow  let me look let me look  no im not done yet  i wanna see it give me the mirror  no i need to see it its my hair and i want to look  sweetie you gotta trust me on this  its not ready to be seen  give me the toaster no  fine ill get a spoon  oh my god im hideous  honey nobody looks their best in a big spoon  thats it im shaving my head  youll look just like mike  youre gonna confuse everybody  carl if you tell a woman you love her  and she doesnt say it back  you dont follow up with will you marry me  why not  its like if she doesnt want to kiss you  you dont take your pants off  did she tell you about that  hey i sat in gum  besides ill never get  a better proposal opportunity  im wearing a tuxedo love is in the air  and ill have a microphone in my hand  wait what  im doing it at the reception during  my best man toast no youre not  itll be perfect  ill say some lovely words about you and molly  then turn to christina  and ask her to be my wife  carl  remember that awkward moment at dinner when your i love yo  was followed by a black hole of silence crickets  and a sagebrush tumbling through the restaurant  yes  okay now add a microphone to that  about a 150 friends and family  and me hitting you in the head with a chair  are you boys decent  i just wanted to see how michael was holding up  nana carls trying to ruin my wedding  leave her out of this  what did you do now knucklehead jones  hes gonna propose to christina during my reception  and she doesnt even love him  she does too but shes afraid to say it  i just need to put some more cheese on the mousetrap  youre proposing to that poor woman  is that why my nice jade ring has gone missing  but you said i could have it after im dead  but if you keep stealing stuff out of my bedroom  i swear it will be youruneral and my trial  what do you mean your limo has been towed  i thought you guys could park anywhere like ambulances  you did too  okay im coming down  got to go  ready  wow  look at you  is it okay oh  just beautiful  perfect  thank you for holding it together for me  i dont know what i would have done without you  probably still be at that hair salon  throwing curlers at that beautician  did i really do that  i have no memory of that  you did inhale about two cans of hairspray so  is the limo here yet  want to hear a funny story  dont worry mol  were on our way to the church  and everything is gonna be fine  youre probably not in the mood to push are you  im sorry  carl im begging you  dont ask christina to marry you at my reception  do anything else you want to ruin it  get drunk cannonball into the wedding cake  have the deejay play thriller do your zombie dance  how about i pop the question  after you guys pull away in the limo  delightful as long as you can see the back  of my head you can humiliate yourself  and everyone around you  i cant believe you dont want to witness the disaster  video it with your cell phone  well that is a given  my only question is when i put it on youtube  should i add a car crash or a wahwahwah  hey fellas hows everything going in here  uh fine dad  can i talk to you for a second  sure  all right whats going on with you and mom  were getting along enjoying each others company  isnt that what you wanted  what i heard through the walls last night  is nothing close to what i wanted  so what youre just gonna leave your wife  and move back with mom  kind of romantic huh  like one of those movies where the couple realizes  they were always meant to be together  see i was thinking more friday the 13th or saw  where you cut off your own arm to escape the pain  all right buddy lets go over your vows  well
