                here you are gentlemen  a hot breakfast for two of chicagos finest  in the spirit of christmas i have provided you each  with a complimentary sausage link  if you need anything else  merely wave your hand and i will appear like a magic genie  boy he becomes a total kissass at gift time doesnt he  mmhmm  yeah the day before his birthday he gave me free bacon  so did you finish all your christmas shopping yet  almost  i just bought grandma a fivebranch wig tree  she puts all her different coifs on that  its gonna look like a jackson family reunion  all thats left to do is swing by the car wash  and pick up a few stocking stuffers  oh so i guess im getting  another naked lady car freshener  no im not buying any more of those  thing didnt smell anything like a naked lady  but dont worry i got you something  youre really gonna like  thats what you said about the singing rubber fish  that was a great gift whyd you take it  out of the bathroom it was motionactivated  every time i stood up to wipe  i heard dont worry be happy  thats good advice in any room of the house  so whatd you end up getting for molly  im still circling a couple things  you know trying to narrow it down find the perfect gift  you got nothing do you not a damn thing  i have absolutely no idea what the woman likes  well apparently she likes big dumb guys  well it would be stupid to get her  another one of those wouldnt it  hey how about a gift card  you know what a gift card says here you do it  which is barely forgivable for your best friend  let alone the woman that youre sharing a bed with  does that mean you didnt like the macys gift card  i gave you last year  it was for 15 i got a key chain  after i added 30 of my own money  okay so no gift cards this is how i learn  i might be able to scrape together enough  to buy molly a nice piece of jewelry  oh no it sets the bar too high  you get her jewelry on your first christmas  theres no going back to smoked salmon or bath beads  yeah but if i start too small  its gonna look like i dont care  get her a nice pair of shoes  really yeah women love shoes  thats true they do  plus mollys got those beautiful feet  nice high arches  and sweet little toes that always look impeccable  what are you doing looking at my girlfriends feet  hey i appreciate nicelooking feet on a woman  and hers are outstanding  she could be a flipflop model  know what  im taking your complimentary sausage link  and i think you know why  fine if you dont want my help good luck  i dont even know her shoe size  six and a half  would you like to spice up your coffee  with a fresh cinnamon stick  thank you samuel very nice of you  i wish i could do more but as you know  i am a humble man of meager means  here you go merry christmas  oh what an unexpected surprise  thank you so much  hey samuel were out of cream over here  well we all have our little problems dont we big guy   for the first time in my life    i see love    my god its like the shoe warehouse in here  six and a half  son of a bitch was right  molly mike you up here  what are you doing  groans i mustve dozed off  are you feeling okay  yeah yeah yeah i was just resting my eyes  tough day on the mean streets of chicago  you want to come downstairs  were trimming the tree great  ill be down in a minute i can string the popcorn  assuming you have an ultrasonic popcorn popper  with an automatic butter dispenser  as a matter of fact we do  good good  hey you know what would be fun  to put on some christmas music down there  do you have an ipod  yes i do  why dont i go get it  smooth real smooth  goofy voice do you have an ultrasonic popcorn popper  with an automatic butter dispenser  well its official im dating clueless joe jackson  yeah he clearly hasnt had a lot of girlfriends  yesterday he asked me if you needed jumper cables  or if youd ever shown any interest in golf  i love that hes trying to find the perfect gift  but hes running out of time  so im guessing ill be getting ear muffs and a fudge log  which ill love  whatd you get him  this really cool leather bomber jacket  has he been hinting for it  not exactly but his favorite movies  are top gun and memphis belle  and every time we drive somewhere  he pretends im his copilot  so it was a reasonable guess  roger that  now have you given him any hints about what you want  or are you just gonna feign enthusiasm  when he gives you a bedazzler  no ive left a couple of open catalogs  laying around on the night stand  well you might want to leave those catalogs  in the refrigerator or next to the crapper  otherwise youre gonna be losing valuable closet space  for a set of golf clubs  hey im not gonna put a postit on his forehead  i think its important for him to figure out  the kind of gift i might like  and not just some stupid trip on the same cruise ship  that his wife and kids are on  thats messed up right  uh yeah  absolutely  i mean i still went  ended up spending the whole time getting high in my cabin  boy i sure do like weed  god bless her shes always been easy to shop for  i dont understand  why not just get her the deluxe thighmaster  yeah and how about if she gets you the ab roller  okay point taken  and what was the problem  with the hickory farms cheese and salami bouquet  you dont deserve a girlfriend  cool bomber jacket  hey get away from that were here for molly  whoa secret pocket  i can put stuff in there  its gonna be cheaper after christmas  now get over here and lets check out some lingerie  carl nobody likes getting underwear for christmas  its like a book or socks  or a 15 gift card  but were not talking about regular underwear  were talking satin and lace to rub on your face  but isnt lingerie more of a gift for me than for her  oh like she was ever gonna see any of that cheese and salami  now check this out  nothing beats the basic black merry widow  that buttons at the crotch for easy access  for going to the bathroom right  you really dont deserve a girlfriend  now picture her in this  maybe add a pair of highheeled opentoed shoes  to wear with it mm mm mm  see now this image here this will haunt me  there you are  i knew id

in the window  maybe i dont know  but i do know the coffee at that place is terrific  because they use a french press which i also think they sell  cool have you ever been in that pet store  they got all these cockatoos i think theyre cockatoos  theyre the ones with the feather mohawk right  im not sure  im not really a bird expert  i guess i could go look it up on my laptop  ah wait  i left it in

although ive heard those exotic birds  can live up to  mike please dont buy me a bird  well then i dont know what the hell to get you  youre a closed book lady  no im not  im an open catalog laying on the nightstand  i dont know what that means  im lost  i was in the mall for six hours today  the only thing i bought  was a diet sprite a fatfree lemon bar  and a really cool bomber jacket for myself

year  oh i slipped up  whos the one who let him walk out of here  with a bomber jacket what was i gonna do  i was helping grandma get her rascal down the escalator  he wandered off and then came back

bit of time before the stores close  lets not complicate the situation  mike is a simple man with simple tastes  okay what about a nice cologne  no smells are lost on him  he gets into the squad car

christmas  what happened did your reindeer finally quit  ive been in every store on michigan avenue  trying to find the perfect gift for molly and i cant do it  well in my village we have an old proverb  when in doubt say it with cattle  i cant give her a cow she doesnt even want a bird  i dont know i keep looking for something that says  youre the greatest thing that ever happened to me  and so far the closest thing i found  is an embroidered sweatshirt  that says youre the greatest thing that ever happened to me  i cannot believe the pressure you americans  put on yourself at the holidays  and why  you live in nice homes have a car to drive  and clearly enough food to eat  you know i let the reindeer comment slide  but now youre just poking the bear  what i am trying to say is that this is a time  to be with family and to share joy with one another  not schlepping from store to store  trying to find some useless trinket  to express what is in your heart  schlepping  its christmas eve  this place is like jew central  my point is there is nothing in the world more precious  than the love that one human being gives to another  that is the one gift in life  you cannot
