                1 im not going to make it over tonight sweetie  yeah i got to pull another double shift  the snowstorms left us shorthanded  and somebodys got to keep the city  from crumbling into anarchy and mob rule  hand me the pringles  no no the ranch  ill see you tomorrow when i get off of work  i love you too  poor thing she really misses me  well life with a police officer is a life of sacrifice  thats why ive chosen not to enter into a relationship  isnt fair to the woman  i see its got nothing to do  with her being unwilling to climb in your window  after your grandma falls asleep  hey if a womans not willing to shimmy up a drainpipe  to get a little taste of carl mcmillan  then shes too full of herself anyway  you know what  if were going to be here for a while  im going to kick my shoes off  uhuh leave those nasty things on  i dont want to be breathing your stanky foot funk  hey my socks got soaking wet  pushing that car out of the ditch  and i dont want to catch a cold  so youre going to air em out over the heating vents  you might as well just stick your toes in my nostrils  and besides i told you to wear your galoshes today  i dont like the galoshes  they compromise the dignity of the uniform  right kind of like that big glob of pickle relish  you got on your badge  its salsa  regardless id prefer you to leave your shoes on  its bad enough to be smelling  your breath armpits and backside  we dont need to be adding the smell of your feet  and my vomit to the mix  i hate to tell you this but after a double shift  youre not exactly a romp in a flowery meadow  hey every time weve stopped for coffee  i have brushed my teeth washed my face  and splashed on a couple a drops of my signature scent  yeah lets talk about your signature scent  what is it exactly  cause it smells like the inside of a hamster cage  thats the cedar bark  it also contains sandalwood clove and a hint of jasmine  but im guessing those aromatic subtleties are lost  on a man who has two blocks of parmesan cheese for feet  fine  lets stop at a drugstore and ill buy some new socks  you need to buy some new feet  you know what screw it  the shoes are coming off  then im opening all the windows  fine its ten below  well both just freeze to death  id rather freeze to death than die  from a bad case of parmesan foot lung  hey whatever doesnt bother me  doesnt bother me either  hey i like the cold  turn on the air conditioner  dont think i wont do it  im gonna  for the first time in my life   i see love    knocking at door  what are you doing its ten below out here  well its 459 in here  and we dont open until 500  you know we have a battering ram in the car  and ive got french toast in the back so play nice  insistent knocking  come on  knocking continues  banging  mike and carl groaning  morning gentleman  do you have a reservation  i dont want to sit here  why not  its too close to the door i prefer a booth  fine well do whatever you want  like we always do  oh really  we always do what i want  thats why we got to listen to bluegrass music  on the drive home every night  its not bluegrass its roots music  they aint my roots  just a bunch of hillbillies with banjos  complaining about the train being late  wheres that train   shes on that train i missed that train   train train train   if you dont like my choice in music  get another ride to work  it wasnt my idea to carpool  well i thought it would save you a little money  with both of us paying for gas  and it would if we were both actually paying for gas  unfortunately your wallet and your pants  are like superman and clark kent  never in the same place at the same time  im not going to apologize to you for being frugal  frugal you live rentfree at your grandmas house  and she even cuts your hair  cutting my hair brings that old woman a lot of joy  besides nana cuts the straightest lines in town  id be a fool to bring my business elsewhere  seriously though  dont you think its a little weird  a grown man living with his grandmother  hey i dont live with her she lives with me  in her house  yes which ill inherit when she dies  and as long as were asking  the tough questions let my ask you something  how are you so  fat is that what you want to know smart guy  no actually i was going to say bullheaded  i spend all day in a car with you  i know why youre so fat  you know just because im overweight  you think youre better than me  not at everything just foot racing swimming  climbing getting in the car getting out of the car  picking up a quarter pushing a plate away  thats it im switching tables  oh and deny me your witty conversation  and brilliant repartee  hey im done talking to you  i was done talking to you first  you always got to get the last word in huh  sure as hell not going to get the last doughnut  oh good  spread the crappy tip over two tables  i hope the lasagnas okay  its all fatfree  i used three different types of cheeses  and diced up fresh tomatoes and garlic for the sauce  its fine  well thats what i was shooting for  fine  last chance to throw in and dandy  just to keep a girl from hanging herself  what oh im sorry sweetie its great  and i really appreciate you going to all the trouble  well youve been working really hard lately  so do criminals actually venture out in this kind of weather  not really today was mostly  assisting stranded motorists  and helping an old lady chip her frozen cat out of a tree  oh my god please tell me that didnt actually happen  i wish i could we ended up just sawing off  the whole branch and leaving it on her porch  i for one appreciate the fact  that there are brave men like you out there protecting us  ill tell you the real challenge  is being stuck in a car with carl all day  hes always pushing my buttons picking away  trying to get my goat  pick pick pick pick pick  well the important thing is youre here now  andand were together  hey i had uh quite the adventure myself today  we just got this new vice principal and  you know what carl was giving me a hard time about today  i dont  my feet  he said my feet smell like cheese  parmesan  yeah  but they dont do they  no  god no  i dont know how much longer i can put up with him  i mean hes really starting to drive me crazy  i understand but when you start  to feel yourself getting mad at him  just remember hes tired  and overworked and probably just needs somebody to vent to  so do i but i choose not to  i suffer in silence  true  but if it gets too bad  you have the option of venting to me  oh i would never do that  our time together is precious  well carls not the stoic rock that you are sweetie and  he doesnt have a regular girlfriend and  i know im all hes got  poor little loser  be patient with him  be the bigger man  and when he starts to drive you crazy  just take a deep breath  and try and remember that you love him  its not going to be easy  trust me its not  now is there anything i can do  to take care of my big strong hardworking man  boy after dinner id sure love a foot rub  oh come on  you can do better than that  i said anything  please  and just remember if you do start to slide  dont panic and just turn into the skid  carl i know how to operate a motor vehicle  mmhmm you scored a 62 on your police drivers test  give me a break i knocked down one cone  yeah and that one cone could have been an old lady or a baby  how many babies you see  just laying in the middle of the road  one is all it takes  cell phone ringing  not supposed to talk on your cell phone while youre driving  ill keep it short okay  the length of the call doesnt matter  its against the law in the city of chicago  uhhuh so is murder  hey sweetie  just being in the car with you makes me an accessory  oh yeah that will be great  sounds like fun  very thoughtful  i could use a little break  i love you too  ill see you tonight  what are you talking about seeing her tonight  i just signed us up for another double shift  well i cant do it molly wants to take me  to the drake hotel for a little intown getaway  call her back and tell her you cant go  i cant call her back its against the law  in the city of chicago  were talking double golden time  you dont just turn your back on that kind of money  well im sorry  unlike you im not ruled by the almighty dollar  yeah youre ruled by the almighty girlfriend  hey i do what i want shes not the boss of me  watch the road i am  uhoh  turn into it turn into it  dont tell me how to drive  turn into it  crashing  hey carl  why dont you let me drive today  that way you can relax a little  you distracted the driver of the vehicle  we were having a conversation  i didnt throw a snake at you  why dont you just admit that youre a crappy driver  im not going to let you get to me today carl  you know why because im the bigger man here  youre the bigger man everywhere  you notice the car didnt tip over on my side  okay  you need to vent go ahead  but its not going to change the fact  that youre a loser and you need to get a life  who are you calling a loser  molly was right about you youre lonely  you dont have a girlfriend  you dump all your crap on me  oh i see so now youre badmouthing me  to your girlfriend now thats what you do  when youre in a healthy relationship  but you wouldnt know that  cause im all youve got  and this is not healthy  you know what the hell with you  im out of here  man get off of me i wouldnt be on you  if you didnt put the car in a ditch shut up  you shut up  boy i hope hes okay  what time was he supposed to pick you up  about an hour ago  did you try calling him  yeah im just getting voice mail and i cant listen  to devil went down to georgia one more time  maybe hes late  because he had to stop a bank heist or defuse a bomb  i dated a cop once  it happened to him all the time  and it was weird cause he was a mall cop  it was weird but i think were straying from the  topic at hand  we had a topic  good for us  i just hope  this little weekend getaway you know helps relax him  hes been so stressed out lately  and he just comes home and eats and dumps his day on me  mm vince does that to me constantly  well how do you deal with it well  i try to remember that men are ruled by testosterone  which is essentially a poison  so when you get that big loud mouth jabbering in your face  you just say to yourself  this is a sick individual  he is suffering from semen brain  doorbell rings  aw mom i dont know what id do  without your folksy wisdom  oh my god mike what happened  i had a little car accident  its nothing the paramedics made me wear this thing  do you have whiplash  cause that can be pretty serious  no nothing like that carl stepped on my neck  climbing out of the car  ooh look they have a spa here  wouldnt it be fun to get a couples massage  hot oil scented candles romantic music  eh  what do you mean eh  i dont like the idea of strangers touching me  laying naked on a table while some ukrainian guy  uses my ass as a speed bag  okay thats not how they describe it in the brochure  boy he is never gonna let me forget  about putting that car in the ditch  i can hear him now youre a lousy driver  you knocked down the cone you killed the baby  a 62 is still  a very respectable score  okay why dont we just forget about carl for tonight  im sure monday morning everythingll be back to normal  between you guys  oh i dont know in the tow truck  he said he wanted a new partner and you know what  fine by me good riddance  why dont you just call him and settle this thing  youll feel so much better when you do  and let him think that hes ruining our romantic getaway  ha i wouldnt give him the satisfaction  yeah but he kind of is  oh no hes not im gonna take a nice hot shower  and when i come back im gonna make sweet love  to my girlfriend something carl cant do  cause carl doesnt have a girlfriend cause carls a loser  and im a winner so drop your drawers  and assume the position and get ready to make love to a waiter  get ready to make love to a pillow  pounding on door  carlton you keep slamming doors and stomping around  and im coming up there with my king james bible  and a whipping belt  doorbell rings  lord give me patience or an untraceable handgun  hi im not sure if you remember me  youre michaels little lady friend   yeah molly  of course  come on in baby  oh dont tell me those two idiots  dragged you into this childishness  do you have any idea what theyre fighting about  cause mikes not making any sense at all  well whatever it is i guarantee you its stupid  sit down  last time they had a big fight like this  it was over popeyes chicken versus kentucky fried  really mmhmm  and that one could only be resolved with a blind taste test  yeah after all that mess  they both ended up choosing the other ones chicken  how often do they have fights like this  couple times a year  usually during a cold snap or a heat wave  they stay cooped up in that squad car too long  and start going at each other  like two monkeys having a poop fight  whats going on down here  like he wasnt sitting on the top step  listening to every word  hey carl  look if youre here to apologize  for your boyfriend im not interested  thats not why im here  that man said some very hurtful things  malicious things insinuating that im cheap  cheap boy wears his underwear until it disintegrates  its like trying to wash cobwebs  molly look all i know is  im trying to have a romantic weekend with mike and  all he can talk about is you  really  is that a source of pride for you  you masturbating knucklehead  the boys so cheap  hes got magazines dating back to pubic hair  okay well  lets not open that can of worms please  i was just hoping that you guys could  well work this out  you heard her  pick up the phone right now and put an end to this mess  oh just because he has a girlfriend im the one that has to apologize  no youre gonna apologize  because its the christian thing to do  and if you dont im gonna part your behind  like its the red sea and my foot is moses  you know what i dont have to stand here and take this  all right sit down if you want cause im just warming up  laughing  a man should be treated with more respect in his own house  well if you ever get one and im ever in it ill do that  do you have somewhere you need to get to  or would you like to have a cup of tea  id love a cup of tea  all right coming right up  knocking  molly  where you been did you forget your key  disgusted groan  sending your girlfriend to fight your fights for you now huh  what are you talking about molly went to your house  dont act surprised it belittles us both  well i had no idea she was gonna go over there you know  we used to settle our quarrels man to man face to face  and with the occasional blind taste test  but none of this sending a woman over to a friends house  singing sad songs of erectile dysfunction  she didnt do that yeah she did  hey soon as i got out of the shower i was gonna give it to her good  well im just telling you what she said  she told me and my grandma that you couldnt perform  your manly duties because you were thinking about me  really i sent molly to tell you and your grandma  that i couldnt deliver the mail  does that sound like a good plan to you  well thats why i came here to discuss it with you  i thought it was illadvised  man i dont know whats in her head lately  i mean i know shes been missing me  but i had no idea shed go rogue  sighs yeah we should probably minimize these double shifts  so she doesnt go completely off the deep end  im sorry if she upset you  it was just startling more than anything  man this room is nice  yeah theres a jacuzzi tub a
