                1 boy you ladies really go all out at the holidays huh  yes we do and save your air  cause you still have to blow up an eightfoot snowman  and do that inside of the house  i did it on the front lawn last year  and we got a lot of calls from the neighbors  its not your fault they put his little nozzle in the front  and now that we have a man that can get up on the roof  with christmas lights and a nail gun  we can really pimp this bitch out  should i try and untangle these  or you just want to drop them from the roof on new years eve  no for new years eve we do roman candles and air horns  oh god the neighbors hate us  oh look stockings  oh oh  we got to hang one up for mike too  do you still have yours from when you were a kid  mom didnt really save a lot of that stuff  and truthfully christmas wasnt really a big deal  around our house  but you still celebrated didnt you  sure when my dad was around wed have a very traditional christmas  hed get a tree wed exchange gifts  my mom would call him cheap and start a fight  hed take a bottle of booze into the backyard  id cry and wed go to bed  oh my god was it like that every year  oh after he moved out it got kind of sad  mom and i would have  our christmas dinners at dennys  and then go over to daley plaza and watch the ice skaters fall  ah how she loved to watch them fall  well were going to get rid of the ghosts of christmas past  and make you some new memories right girls  right you betcha  tomorrow were going to go pick out a christmas tree  and pop some popcorn and string some cranberries  apple cider with schnapps  hot cocoa with schnapps  the housell be smelling like gingerbread and sugar cookies  that sounds really nice you bet it does  so strap on your elf hat buddy  cause santa claus is coming to town  and that twinklyeyed rascal  likes to party with the flynn girls  and in this house he dont care if youve been naughty or nice  thats good cause in my house if you smarted off  to your mom during christmas week your present went  from a super nintendo to a bag of tube socks  with a note from santa saying  if you dont like it go live with your dad and his whore  okay  who else wants schnapps i do  i could use one  no sweetie probably better if you didnt drink  for the first time in my life   i see love   molly okay okay all right settle down  now i know youre all excited about christmas break  and im happy to tell you there wont be any homework  kids cheering that is my present to you  but i do want you to do one thing for me  kids groaning no come on  during the holiday season  when youre playing with all your new toys  i want you to pick out one person  and do something nice for them  i thought you said there was no homework  this isnt really homework  this is just offering to do something kind  for somebody who might need your help  it doesnt have to be somebody in your family  like a stranger no no not like a stranger  we talked about that thats dangerous  there are a lot of creepos out there  but my point is that bell ringing  its better to give than receive  and to be thankful  for what you have walk dont run  happy holidays  whoo parents problem now  molly  rebecca hi  i just wanted to stop by to wish you a happy holiday  since youre probably not coming to the faculty party  no i was going to swing by  as long as theres still free

ingrates  and their students  birdie were in here  sit down youre missing the party  poor things five squares short of a bingo aint she  they actually tried sacking her a few years ago  she kept pulling the fire alarm thinking it was nickel slots  well thank god she shrunk so much and she cant reach em anymore  peggy can i talk to you for a second ill be right back  but dont start decorating birdie without me  is the rumor true about the viceprincipal job  its not a rumor its a fact  i just saw the email on the janitors iphone  damn it i worked my butt off to get that job  she worked her butt too  but it was on the principals joystick  and whatever else he pointed at and told her to straddle  its not fair  i told you to take the low road  no i wasnt going to use blackmail  to get a job i clearly deserved  its not supposed to work like that  welcome to the wonderful world of disappointment  the good news is youre the young hot one  wow this new beard is nice  not too itchy very lifelike  none too soon because the old one was starting to get a little gamey  well it was attached to your mouth  and that area gets a lot of holiday traffic  after a couple of hot chocolates and a taffy apple  it starts to look like a poodles ass  im glad i sprung for the deluxe one  it says on the label its the facial hair preferred  by most santas father times and zz top tribute bands  meanwhile i got to put on that same ratty elf costume  with the green tights and a tiny shirt  thank god ive got shapely legs and confidence  are you angling to be santa again lord no  im still trying to get over the sting of last year  all them kids coming up to me talking about  santa aint black santa aint black  and those were the black kids  well me walking around in that elf costume  wasnt exactly a crowd pleaser  yeah like those underprivileged kids  havent seen enough ugly in their lives  happy holidays gentlemen  all right and keep the change  a 215 tip  it truly is a season of miracles  just take it  god bless you kind sir  i shall run out right now  and buy the fattest christmas goose in all the land  and perhaps a skateboard for tiny tim  now that i can afford to get his little legs fixed  see that right there is why i never tip him  oh  well its officially christmas  birdies lit and so are we  all im saying is that that job should have been mine  but who did they

your first mistake  once those bastards know you give a damn  thats when they got you by the little gray curlies  thats right  no no no its not supposed to be like that  hard work and dedication are supposed to be rewarded right  sure when you walk through the forest  all the bluebirds are singing pretty songs  putting flowers in your hair and crapping candy kisses  wake up sap life is cruel  i learned that lesson a long time ago with my first husband  oh here we go  another tragic tale about you  and that bowlegged son of a bitch  i like bowlegged men  just grab em by the ankles and make a wish  he was working double shifts  so we could save up enough money to buy our own weenie truck  blah blah blah  then he drained the bank account and moved to wisconsin  with some halfcherokee gal  chippewa  the point is your heart was broken  your dreams were squashed  and now pocahontas is driving around in your weenie truck  what am i supposed to do just stop trying  i cant live like that  i need to believe that if i do my best and be a good person  ill be the one driving the weenie truck  vin thats a beautiful tree best one they had  i own the vacant lot where the guy sells em  so he gives me first choice  thats why we get free pumpkins at halloween stuffed bunnies on easter  and crack cocaine pretty much year round  mike there she is my christmas angel  and youre just in time to
