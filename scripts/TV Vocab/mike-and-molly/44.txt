                i cant decide between a veil or a hat  i mean i want to look elegant but with a you know  sense of whimsy  traditional but fun  maybe they have one of those beer can hats  but for champagne flutes  thats elegant and fun  victoria my wedding is in three weeks  and youre either part of the problem  or youre part of the solution  dont upset your sister  i think the veil youre wearing is gorgeous  i hate it  i hate it too  here we are  oh its so beautiful  amazing  oh my god i think im going to cry  where the hell are the wrist loops to carry the train  the seamstress will

be a beautiful bride though isnt she  absolutely  so happy for her  yeah  until about two years ago  id have bet cash money she was going to be  one of those cranky old spinsters  in sensible shoes and a boys haircut  living in a mobile home  filled with stacks of old redbook magazines  and 25 uncaged parakeets  wed go visit her on the weekends  and walk through her gauntlet  of wind chimes and dream catchers  ignoring the health department citations  and her prominent chin whiskers  tada  there she is  the most beautiful bride in the whole world  not too shabby right  you look amazing  lets get you zipped up  okay  all right  looks like we might need to let this out just a smidge  no you wont  im just a few pounds from my target weight  and when i set a goal for myself  ii reach it

time she starved herself  she ate half a jar of my avocado face scrub  in her defense it does look like guacamole  that may be but a sane woman  doesnt dig around her mothers makeup kit  looking for a snack  whats going on  mollys trying to drop six pounds before the wedding  so were getting rid of everything but ice and onions  if shes really serious about this weight loss thing  starving herself is not the answer  oh shes exercising too  shes out right now jogging around the neighborhood  not talking diet and exercise  im referring to the weight loss miracle  known as horse laxatives  vince dont be an ass  im serious i got a jockey buddy  who sometimes has to drop five pounds in six hours  all he needs is one cap full of hiyo silver  and a good book  two and a half miles  pretty good tomorrow well go for three  i thought we were supposed  to take a day off  you know let the muscles reattach themselves to the bone  no you cant have a day off  its all about speeding up your metabolism  now im going to go take a shower and make us  a nice healthy smoothie out of beets carrots and kale  thats my reward for running in the dark  and giving myself a two and a half mile wedgie  its all yours  really  yeah but eat it behind the garage  god bless you  that is your fifth cup of coffee  you better have an empty milk jug in the car  cause im not spending my entire day  trying to find portapotties and big trees  molly dragged me out of bed  at 500 this morning to go jogging  oh that was you  i have to call my roommates  and tell them it wasnt godzilla  i have hot coffee in my hand  and im going on about five hours of sleep  boy someone woke up  on the wrong side of tokyo this morning  im guessing this new fitness regime  has something to do with your impending nuptials  shes driving me crazy carl  i dont know why shes making  such a big deal out of a wedding  hey this is a huge milestone in a womans life  its something shes been dreaming  and fantasizing about since she was a young girl  but its just one day  one day she will remember forever  for me and you thats like the first time  we ever saw a reallife naked boob  october 6 1988  joy harmon was her name  she was the first girl in our class to get boobs  and i was the third guy to see them mmhmm  and i bet you the time leading up to that  was filled with hope and expectation  oh god yes she told me at lunch  i could see one of them after school  i remember it was pizza day  and i left half of it on my plate  that speaks volumes right there  when the bell rang  i ran to meet her underneath the bleachers  my heart was pounding with anticipation  of course it was  there can be no other first time  and you wanted it to be perfect and it was  i could tell she liked me cause she showed me  the second one without me even asking  and thats after i drooled all over the first one  mmm  yeah  cant see one without the other  its like the kill bill movies  they were like two perfect pieces of flan  you know if you put a hersheys kiss on each one  now if youd like to get  into your brides head a little bit  just change boobs to holy matrimony  and you can understand where shes coming from  wow i always knew it was important to her  but i never realized it consumed her every thought  and dictated her every action mmhmm  well sometimes you got to step back  and look at things from an intellectual standpoint  thanks for helping me understand  no problem  so im guessing joy harmon is the reason  you always order two pieces of flan  you know i hope one day molly gets me the way you do  all right here we go  feeling good feeling good  feeling good oh  whoops  hello old friend  we meet again  all right stop  stop stop stop  son of a bitch  liar  uhoh shes arguing with the scale
