                1 im really proud of how well  youve been sticking to your diet sweetie  well since youre dead set on me wearing  a white tux at the wedding  id rather look more like a refrigerator than a milk truck  ive changed my mind about the white tux  lets just go basic black  then what are we doing at an oa meeting  lets go get pie  since were talking about the wedding  i wanted to discuss our vows with you  i know you dont want to say obey  no i do not  i do however want you to say it  yes sir  seriously though i thought you know  instead of doing the traditional i dos  it might be fun if we write our vows  fun for who that sounds like a nightmare  no it could be really sweet  saying whats in our heart  expressing our love in front of all our friends and family  thats exactly what i was picturing  when i said nightmare  come on whats the big deal  theres plenty of time between now and then  to jot down a few heartfelt sentiments  about how much i dazzle you each day  easy for you you were an english lit major  im about one head bump away  from being a member of the plant family  technically its the plant kingdom  it goes kingdom phylum class order  family genus species  weddings off  hey kids  hey  hey kids hey harry  you guys notice anything different about me  hint i have three andahalf less of them  mimics buzzer what are pounds  that is correct  what happened  little slow on the buzzer brainiac  for the first time in my life   i see love   that was a great oa meeting  yeah did you see the look on their fat little faces  when i said i dropped threeandahalf pounds  did they look anything like ours  im sorry im kind of on a lowcarb high  i went down an entire belt hole today  one of the original holes or one you punched yourself  original  good for you  more free refills on coffee  or does one of you big spenders wanna splurge on a tea bag  top me off benson  you oa people never eat do you  at least not when there are witnesses  am i right mike b  listen now that ive dropped all this weight  and gotten a handle on my combination skin  im thinking its time  to dip my toe back in the love pond  aw well thats great  im sure theres a nice girl out there for you  assuming thats what you mean by toe and pond  the one ive got my eye on is very nice and sweet  and stacked like a sleeve of oreos  well be careful  you dont wanna date out of your league  why not you did  just watch out harry  you been doing really good on your diet  and you dont wanna end up brokenhearted  and only leaving the house  to chase down an ice cream truck  oh ive never been that bad  besides if you lay down in the road they have to stop  since when did it become a crime for a man  to urinate in a public fountain  im guessing about three days after they invented fountains  well they should put up a sign or something  not just blindside us with these crazy laws  pipe down  did i tell you about mollys latest bright idea  she wants us to write our own wedding vows  really  yeah shes gonna recite some beautiful soliloquy  and im gonna be quoting dirty limericks  and dan fogelberg songs  i love dan fogelberg  i saw him live at kingston mines in 73  did you pee on him  when are you gonna let that go  you dont need to sweat the vows  ive heard you wax poetic  for 20 minutes about a chunk of lasagna  oh you mean the one from arnie salernos  you cant just call that lasagna  its a work of art  its a perfect union of gooey mozzarella  and taut teasing noodles  and a deceptively simple sauce  each ingredient frolicking in my mouth  like dolphins dancing in the waves  it didnt just sate my hunger  it changed my life  damn  i can almost taste it  right  hey you can do this vow thing  just substitute lasagna with molly  change the sauce to her eyes  and try not to describe her as a taut teasing noodle  speaking of which i gotta whiz again  and like the emergence of the wildflowers of spring  your love fills the fertile fields of my heart  with dainty dots of bright colors  whoo blows raspberry  what  something stinks and it aint this fish  is the alliteration of fertile fields  and dainty dots too much  no i liked that part  mostly because it was the end  maybe you should try moving the ending  about ten minutes closer to the beginning  well clearly you two would know more about poetry  than an english lit major  why do you keep harping on being an english lit major  yeah you mentioned it twice in your vows  backstory  its friends and family  theyre coming for free cake and booze  not to sit through ken burns presents molly flynn  those hens are always clucking about something arent they  i dont think theyd appreciate being referred to as hens  but yes they are always clucking about something  doorbell rings  i got my shoes off  you dont have to tell me you got your shoes off  im not tearing up because these cartoons are sad  harry what are you doing in this neck of the woods  ive come acalling for the fair victoria  wait a minute victorias the girl you wanted to ask out  aw geez thisll be hard to watch  like a walrus swimming into a boat motor  why dont you and i  have a little talk out on the porch  is this a pep talk  cause i already said my affirmations in the car  i am a good and perfect child  get outside  mike i assure you my intentions are honorable  i mean my thoughts are filthy  but i rarely act on them  listen harry i think its great  that youre feeling good about yourself  and you wanna pursue a relationship  but come on victoria  are you talking about the age difference  cause i can pull out the old jean jacket  and do kind of a clooney thing with my hair  maybe its a good idea to try to walk before you can run  date somebody more like you  a heavyset brunette with hammertoes  no thank you  all right pal go ahead  swing for the fences  is he still going through with it  good for you dumpy im rooting for you  victoria mr notquiteright is here  woof im sweating like a pig  probably just cause youre nervous and fat  oh hi larry  harry  and were off  hi victoria listen i noticed on your facebook page  that youre a fan of the black keys  mmhmm as am i now  and

im a little worried about the whole harryvictoria thing  youre gonna tell her to put the kibosh on it right  he said he wanted to dip his toe back  into the dating pool  yeah well this is the deep end  and theres no lifeguard  cause hes in the changing room boning your sister  hey mike  shes just trying to be nice to the guy  and its just one night  for her its one night  but harrys gonna be prepping for days  going to every bigandtall shop  looking for a shirt thats hip sexy  and doesnt look like someones tenting for termites  this isnt just about harry is it  her name was betsy zajko  i was a sophomore and she was a senior  i just made thirdstring center on the football team  so i was feeling pretty good about myself  whiskey  please  anyway the summer before  her boyfriend had been killed in a dirt bike accident  so she was vulnerable  and most of the guys in her league were a little gunshy  understandable  i mustered up the courage to ask her out  and to my amazement she said yes  i showed up at the dance with a new shirt a corduroy vest  and a pair of my dads dress khakis  hey hello sexy  molly please  sorry  anyway by the end of the night  betsy had slowdanced or dryhumped  the quarterback the fullback  pretty much anybody with a varsity letter and an erection  oh honey  yeah apparently i was the warmup act  for the entire team  and while they were enjoying the fruits of my labor  i was in the parking lot splitting a meat lovers pizza  with the fat tuba player from the marching band  yeah ive got a similar story  mine ends with me  splitting a big bag of white castle hamburgers  with a very grabby equipment manager  hes a she now  i buy my mary kay products from her  roses are red violets are blue  im getting married in three months and i got squat  i

intentionally  you know how you are with guys and  those guys friends and  and those guys friends cousins  little early in the day to call a gal a whore isnt it  no no i am not imp  i am not implying money ever changed hands  jewelry and electronics may have greased that wheel  listen molly god gave me a big heart  and an amazing set of honkers  and i will not apologize for that  and im not asking you to  i just think harry might have unrealistic expectations  you know how guys are  wait  so he thinks a couple of concert tickets  is gonna give him a backstage ass pass  god no thats not what im saying at all  or would ever say  i thought he was just a sweet nice guy  its always the shy ones that want to wine and climb you  hey im just trying to protect both of you  oh forget it  how long was
