world  my lady im sorry for your loss  her loss  her father was a confessed traitor  but still her father  surely having so recently lost your own beloved father  you can sympathize  my father was a traitor  my mother and brother are traitors too  i am loyal to my beloved joffrey  of course you are  well enjoy your name day your grace  wish i could stay and celebrate  but there is work to be done  what work  why are you here  the raven arrived from the citadel   this morning your grace  the conclave has met considered reports  from maesters all over the seven kingdoms  and declared this great summer  done at last  the longest summer in living memory  the peasants say a long summer means   an even longer winter  a common superstition  we have enough wheat for a fiveyear winter  if it lasts any longer  well have fewer peasants  the citys drowning in refugees your grace fleeing the war  we have nowhere to house them  and with winter coming itll only get worse  you command the city watch do you not lord slynt  i do your grace  and are you not a lord at my command  i owe my title and lands to your generosity your grace  then do your job shut the gates to the peasants  they belong in the field not our capital  yes your grace  dont get up  more ravishing than ever big sister  war agrees with you  forgive the interruption carry on  what are you doing here  ah its been a remarkable journey  i pissed off the edge of the wall  i slept in a sky cell  i fought with the hill tribes  so many adventures  so much to be thankful for  what are you doing here this is the small council  yes well i do believe the hand of the king  is welcome at all small council meetings  our father is hand of the king  yes but in his absence  your father has named lord tyrion  to serve as hand in his stead while he fights  out all of you out  i would like to know how you tricked father into this  if i were capable of tricking father  id be emperor of the world by now  you brought this on yourself  ive done nothing  quite right you did nothing  when your son called for ned starks head  now the entire north has risen up against us   i tried to stop it  did you you failed  that bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation   robb stark is a child  whos won every battle hes fought  do you understand were losing the war   what do you know about warfare  nothing  but i know people  and i know that our enemies hate each other  almost as much as they hate us   joffrey is king  joffrey is king  you are here to advise him  im only here to advise him  and if the king listens to what i say  the king might just get his uncle jaime back  how  you love your children  its your one redeeming quality  that and your cheekbones  the starks love their children as well   and we have two of them  one   one  arya little animal she disappeared  disappeared what in a puff of smoke  we had three starks to trade  you chopped ones head off and let another escape  father will be furious  it must be odd for you  to be the disappointing child  my lord may the old gods watch over your brother  and all our northern sons  the walls of my holdfast will not stand the winter  the stones were last mortared in the time of king aerys  and im afraid the masons today  are not fit to carry their fathers hammers  when i was a boy i remember seeing them  put up a new tower at torrhens square in a summer  men worked back then  today my holdfast looks like it was built  by drunk children  at night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps  and the gods forbid it rains  why i might as well sleep beneath a waterfall  maintenance of a holdfast  generally falls to the lord of that holdfast  generally yes  but ive sent all the young men off  to fight robb starks war  king robb and its not his war  he didnt choose it  maybe not my lord  but he called in his banners and took the men  joffrey killed my father  your liege lord  do you remember your vows ser  of course i remember  we can spare four masons for a week my lord  will that be sufficient to repair your walls  i i believe it will  we didnt want him here all day did we  i didnt like the way he was talking about robb  nor did i  but listening to people youd rather not listen to  is one of your responsibilities as lord of winterfell  lord portan  my lord may the old gods watch over your brother  and all our northern sons  boil this for an hour and drink the tea  makes all your pain go away  dont have any pain  lucky for you  that way  youve been having those dreams again  i dont dream  everyone dreams  i dont  heard some of the men talking about the comet  they say its an omen  they say it means robb will win a great victory in the south  did they  i heard some other fools say its lannister red  means the lannisters will rule all seven kingdoms before long  heard a stableboy say its the color of blood  to mark the death of your father  the stars dont fall for men  the red comet means one thing boy  dragons  the dragons are all dead  theyve been dead for centuries  mmm  mmm mmm  what did your brother say about them khaleesi  he said they ate meat  he didnt tell you what kind of meat  my brother didnt know anything about dragons  he didnt know anything about anything  eh  she was drogos first gift to me  i remember  i promised to protect them  promised them their enemies would die screaming  how do i make starvation scream  a trick i never learned im afraid  does it ever end  this is farther east than ive ever been  but yes khaleesi  everything ends even the red waste  and youre sure theres no other way  if we go south to the land of the lazarheen  the lamb men will kill us and take your dragons  if we go west to the dothraki sea  the first khalasar we meet  will kill us and take your dragons  no one will take my dragons  they are too weak to fight  as are your people  you must be their strength  as you are mine  rakharo  you never have  this is bad time to start  having a rough time of it  nothings killed me yet   your ass killed the sledge  you offered me a ride  i just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters  i was born in a place like this  later i fell on hard times  are those girls  crasters daughters  i havent seen a girl in six months  id keep on not seeing them if i were you  what he dont like people messing with his daughters  he dont like people

crasters still here  he must be doing something right  what happens to the boys   hmm  he marries his daughters  what does he do with his sons  he said he planned to stop here  on his way to the frostfangs  people make all sorts of plans  i havent seen benjen stark in three years  havent missed him  always treated me like scum  havent had any good wine for a long time  you southerners make

abandoned  where have all the wildlings gone  i could tell you but im thirsty  theres a barrel of dornish wine on the sledge   bring it in here  yes commander  you want to know where theyve all gone  north to join up with mance rayder  your old friend  hes no friend of mine  he broke his vows betrayed his brothers  oh aye  but once he was just a poor black crow  and now hes kingbeyondthewall  hes been calling himself that for years  whats he king of a frozen lake somewhere  thats a goodlooking axe  fresh forged  give it here  youll have another one made at castle black  here  oh thats some lovely steel  you want to know what mance rayder is doing  gathering an army  what i hear hes already got more men  than any of your southern kings  and where does he plan marching this army  when youre all the way north  theres only one direction to go  these are bad times to be living alone in the wild  the cold winds are rising  let them come my roots are sunk deep  wife  tell the lord crow how content we are  this is our place  our husband keeps us safe  better to live free than die a slave  dont it make you jealous old man  to see me with all these young wives  and you with no one to warm your bed  we chose different paths  oh aye and you chose the path with no one but boys on it  youll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof i suppose  and eat me out of pigs  a roof would be welcome  its been hard riding  weve brought our own food and good steel for you  any man lays a hand on one of my wives  he loses the hand  and i see this one staring too long  i might just gouge his eyes out  your roof your rules  who am i   who am i  lord commander   and who are you  jon snow  who are you  your steward  you want to lead one day  then learn how to follow  lord of light come to us in our darkness  we offer you these false gods  take them and cast your light upon us  for the night is dark and full of terrors  for the night is dark and full of terrors  after the long summer  darkness will fall heavy on the world  the stars will bleed  we need to stop her  the cold breath of winter will freeze the seas  not now  and the dead shall rise in the north  all you men were named in the light of the seven  is this how you treat the gods of your fathers  are you so eager to spit on your ancestors  you smell of fear  fear and piss and old bones  do you want to stop me  stop me  in the ancient books its written  that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire  and that sword shall be lightbringer  stannis baratheon  warrior of light  your sword awaits you  lord cast your light upon us  for the night is dark and full of terrors  for the night is dark and full of terror  this woman will lead him into a war he cannot win  stannis is our king  we follow where he leads   even if we dont like the path  king  since that boar killed his brother  every lord wants a coronation  i dont serve the others i serve stannis  as do i but loyal service  means telling hard truths  hes surrounded by fools and fanatics  but he trusts you davos  if you tell him the truth  whats the truth  and i declare upon the honor of my house  that my beloved brother robert  he wasnt my beloved brother  i didnt love him he didnt love me  a harmless courtesy your grace  a lie take it out  that my brother robert left no trueborn heirs  the boy joffrey the boy tommen  and the girl myrcella being born of incest  between cersei lannister and her brother jaime lannister   by right of birth  jaime lannister the kingslayer  call him what he is  and her brother jaime lannister  the kingslayer  by right of birth and blood i do this day lay claim  make it ser jaime lannister the kingslayer  whatever else he is the mans still a knight  ser jaime lannister the kingslayer  by right of birth and blood  i do this day lay claim to the iron throne of westeros  let all true men declare their loyalty  when eddard stark learned the truth he told only me  ill not make the same mistake  send copies of that letter to every corner of the realm  from the arbor to the wall  the time has come to choose  let no man claim ignorance as an excuse  your gracethe lannisters are the true enemy  if for the time being you could make peace with your brother  ill not make peace with renly while he calls himself king  well many have already declared for him  mace tyrell randyll tarly  stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support  the lord of light stands behind him  and how many ships has the lord of light got in his fleet   he has no need for ships  im sure he doesnt  but we do if were going to war  if not renly your grace join forces with robb stark  who would steal the northern half of my kingdom  ive always served thieves according to their desserts  as you well know ser davos  joffrey renly robb stark theyre all thieves  theyll bend the knee or ill destroy them  i owe you an apology my king  my duty is to serve  you have chosen the new god over the old gods  may the lord of light watch over us all  shall we drink together  dont  a cup of wine to honor the one true god  the night is dark and full of terrors old man  but the fire burns them all away  your grace  king in the north  i keep expecting you to leave me  in one castle or another for safekeeping  but you drag me along from camp to camp  have you grown fond of me stark  is that it  ive never seen you with a girl  if i left you with one of my bannermen  your father would know within a fortnight  and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message  release my son and youll be rich beyond your dreams  refuse and your house will be destroyed root and stem  you dont trust the loyalty  of the men following you into battle  oh i trust them with my life  just not with yours  smart boy  whats wrong  dont like being called boy  insulted  you insult yourself kingslayer  youve been defeated by a boy  youre held captive by a boy  perhaps youll be killed by a boy  stannis baratheon sent ravens  to all the high lords of westeros  king joffrey baratheon is neither a true king  nor a true baratheon  hes your bastard son  if thats true stannis is the rightful king  how convenient for him  my father learned the truth  thats why you had him executed  i was your prisoner when ned stark lost his head  your son killed him  so the world wouldnt learn who fathered him  and you you pushed my brother from a window  because he saw you with the queen  you have proof  or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives  im sending one of your cousins down to kings landing  with my peace terms  you think my fathers going to negotiate with you  you dont know him very well  no but hes starting to know me  three victories dont make you a conqueror  its better than three defeats  this city stinks  like dead bodies  a bit corpsey yes  and shit  i thought you wanted to come here  i love it  you love the smell of dead bodies and shit  and cum and garlic and rum  you can smell cum from the balcony  i love the stink i love the noise  cities make me want to fuck  and so did the country  this is where i belong  yes well you need to be careful  no one can know youre here  no one will know  you cant trust anyone in kings landing  theyre all liars good liars bad liars  one or two great liars  what about you  me im not from here im a slave to the truth  truth  you are the biggest little liar i have ever met  why do you think i am so little  im being crushed beneath the weight of all that truth  oh  ned stark actually slept on this  as if the poor man didnt suffer enough  one of the many changes well have to make around here   lord baelish  your grace  i wonder if i might ask you for a favor  of course your grace  ned starks youngest daughter arya  we cant seem to locate her  if shes escaped the capital  winterfell seems the logical destination  and yet my friends in the north report no sign of her  curious  if we choose to negotiate with the starks  the girl has some value whoever finds her  well you know what they say about lannisters and debts  well you could ask varys where she is  hell have an answer for you  whether you believe it  myself i have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs  who knows what they want  a mockingbird  you created your own sigil didnt you  yes  appropriate for a selfmade man  with so many songs to sing  im glad you like it  some people are fortunate enough  to be born into the right family  others have to find their own way  i heard a song once  about a boy of modest means  who found his way into the home of a very prominent family  he loved the eldest daughter  sadly she had eyes for another  when boys and girls live in the same home  awkward situations can arise  sometimes ive heard even brothers and sisters  develop certain affections  and when these affections become common knowledge  well that is an awkward situation indeed  especially in a prominent family  but prominent families often forget a simple truth  ive found  and which truth is that  knowledge is power  seize him  cut his throat  stop wait  ive changed my mind let him go  step back three paces  turn around  close your eyes  power is power  do see if you can take some time away from  your coins and your whores  to locate the stark girl for me  i would very much appreciate it  youre ser alton lannister  i am your grace  i offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms  first your family must release my sisters  second my fathers bones must be returned to us  so he may rest beside his brother and sister  in the crypts beneath winterfell  and the remains of all those who died in his service  must also be returned  their families can honor them with proper funerals   an honorable request your grace  third  joffrey and the queen regent must renounce all claim  to dominion of the north  from this time till the end of time  we are a free and independent kingdom  the king in the north  king in the north  neither joffrey nor any of his men  shall set foot in our lands again  if he disregards this command  he shall suffer the same fate as my father  only i dont need a servant to do my beheading for me  these are your grace these are  these are my terms  if the queen regent and her son meet them ill give them peace  if not  i will litter the south with lannister dead  king joffrey is a baratheon your grace  oh is he  youll ride at daybreak ser alton  that will be all for tonight  a word your grace  you dont have to call me your grace when no ones around  its not so bad once you get used to it  im glad someones gotten used to it  the lannisters are going to reject your terms you know  of course they are  we can fight them in the fields as long as you like  but we wont beat them until you take kings landing  and we cant take kings landing without ships  my father has ships and men who know how to sail them  men who fought my father  men who fought king robert to free themselves  from the yoke of the south just like youre doing now  im his only living son  hell listen to me i know he will  im not a stark i know that  but your father raised me to be an honorable man  we can avenge him together  you dont want balon greyjoy for an ally  i need his ships they say he has 200  they say a million rats live in the sewers of kings landing  shall we rally them to fight for us  i understand you dont trust lord greyjoy  i dont trust lord greyjoy because he is not trustworthy  your father had to go to war to end his rebellion  yes and now im the one rebelling against the throne  before me it was father  you married one rebel and mothered another  i mothered more than just rebels  a fact you seem to have forgotten  if i trade the kingslayer for two girls  my bannermen will string me up by my feet  you want to leave sansa in the queens hands  and arya  i havent heard a word about arya  what are we fighting for if not for them  its more complicated than that  you know it is  its time for me to go home  i havent seen bran or rickon in months  you cant go to winterfell  i beg your pardon  ill send rodrik to watch over the boys  because tomorrow youll ride south to the stormlands  why in the name of all the gods  because i need you to negotiate with renly baratheon  hes rallied an army of 100000  you know him you know his family  i havent seen renly baratheon since he was a boy  you have a hundred other lords  which of these lords do i trust more than you  if renly sides with us  well outnumber them two to one  when they feel the jaws beginning to shut theyll sue for peace  well get the girls back  then well all go home for good  i will ride at first light  we will all be together again soon i promise  youve done so well  your father would be proud   give lord renly my regards  king renly  theres a king in every corner now  what is all this  returning this room to its proper appearance  say what you will about the targaryens they were conquerors  that is a seat for a conqueror  it needs a room to match it not vines and flowers  we cant find arya stark  with luck shes dead in a ditch somewhere  perhaps but if not we need her  theyll never give jaime back to us for sansa alone  i think they might theyre weak  they put too much value on their women  we need to set our armies to the task of finding her  send out as many men as we can  im sure if you asked grandfather  the king does not ask he commands  and my grandfathers stupidity in the field of battle  is the reason robb stark has uncle jaime in the first place  his life is in danger  were at war  all our lives are in danger  i heard a disgusting lie about uncle jaime  and you  our enemies will say anything  to weaken your claim to the throne  its not a claim the throne is mine  of course it is  no one believes this foul gossip  someone believes it  father had other children  besides me and tommen and myrcella  what are you asking  im asking if he fucked other women  when he grew tired of you  how many bastards does he have running  what you just did is punishable by death  you will never do it again  never  that will be all mother  no no no no  do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound  ease into it  slowly with passion  oh yeah  go wash yourselves put some clothes on  both of you are working tonight  we do things differently here daisy  this isnt some fivecopper bawdy house in hayseed hall   haystack hall  wherever youre from  our establishment doesnt cater  to ploughmen and goat herders  lord olsen  taste is everything here  littlefingers a fancy man  dont call him littlefinger  he doesnt like it  lord baelish  she pretends she doesnt speak the common tongue  so that people will think shes exotic  she grew up just down the road in flea bottom  shes beautiful  shes a dumb slut really but a lid for every pot  lord commander  good to see you again  you do realize this establishment  is owned by lord petyr baelish  the kings master of coin  coin which goes in many pockets   orders  whose orders  someone who doesnt care what littlefinger thinks  no you cant no please  no not my barra   please please  enough get it done   kill the bastard  no no   please  give it here  no please  spread out search every house  every room look in every room  people shouting   gendry his name is gendry  where is the bastard  the nights watch please stop  where  they took him up the kingsroad heading
