lovely boy  what do you want  youre called arry  a boy could make a friend  this man has the honor to be jaqen hghar  every night its the same  im running through the godswood howling  these are dreams nothing more  my dreams are different mine are true  i saw something take that child  wildlings serve crueler gods than you or i  ready my horse we leave at dawn  did cersei have you knighted

survivors  well take them back to harrenhal  this ones a girl dressed as a boy  get these prisoners to work bring the girl  i need a new cupbearer  i will give you this one night to reconsider  otherwise i shall destroy you  look to your sins lord renly  the night is dark and full of terrors  i will vouch for her her people and her dragons  be it on your head  welcome to qarth my lady  trust youve not forgotten your smugglers tricks   what am i bringing ashore  the red woman  no one must know what you do and well not speak of this again  game of thrones 2x05  the ghost of harrenhal original air date on april 29 2012      you swear it  by the mother  my son has no interest in the iron throne  then i see no reason for hostility between us  your son can go on calling himself king in the north  the starks will have dominion over all lands north of moat cailin  provided he swears me an oath of fealty  and the wording of this oath  the same ned stark swore to robert 18 years ago  cat their friendship held the kingdoms together  and in return for my sons loyalty  in the morning ill destroy my brothers army  when thats done  baratheon and stark will fight  their common enemy together  as they have done many times before  our two houses have always been close  which is why i am begging you to reconsider this battle  negotiate a peace with your brother  negotiate with stannis  you heard him out there  id have better luck debating the wind  please bring my terms to your son  i believe we are natural allies  i hope he feels the same  together we could end this war in a fortnight  no   no  follow me   youll die for this  no wait it wasnt her   youll  no wa  weve got to leave  theyll hang you for this   inside the kings tent go  now  i wont leave him  you cant avenge him if youre dead  over there go  not that way  we need to go home   loras  my lord my lady  get out  stannis will be here in an hour  when he arrives renlys bannermen will flock to him  your former companions will fight for the privilege  of selling you to their new king  and you want that privilege for yourself  you will note that i am standing here talking to you   not stannis  theres no time for this  ride back to highgarden sister  im not running from stannis  brienne of tarth murdered renly  i dont believe that you dont believe that  who gained the most from our kings death  stannis  i will put a sword through his righteous face  you cant stay here  he would have been a true king  a good king  tell me ser loras  what do you desire most in this world  revenge  i have always found that to be the purest of motivations  but you wont have a chance to put your sword through stannis  not today  youll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground  if it is justice that you want  be smart about it  you cant avenge him from the grave  bring the horses  please  he was very handsome  he was your grace  your grace  calling yourself king doesnt make you one  and if renly wasnt a king i wasnt a queen  do you want to be a queen  no  i want to be the queen  killed by whom  accounts differ  most seem to implicate catelyn stark in some way  really whod have thought  some say it was one of his own kingsguard  while still others say it was stannis himself who did it  after negotiations went sour  whomever did it i say well done  its not what varys says  he says renlys army is flocking to support stannis  which would give stannis superiority over us on both land and sea  littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one  and i say father raised you to have too much respect for money  stannis baratheon is coming for us  sooner rather than later  arent there other things you should be doing  like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away  shell be safer in dorne  yes i know how concerned you are for her safety  it so happens that i am  myrcella is a sweet innocent girl  and i dont blame her at all for you  so clever  arent you always so clever  with your schemes and your plots  schemes and plots are the same thing  they are going to attack us  we need to be ready  no need to concern yourself over it  the king is taking personal charge of siege preparations  may i ask specifically what the king has in mind  you may specifically or you may ask vaguely  the answer will be the same  its important that we talk about this  its the kings royal prerogative  to withhold sensitive information from his councilors  its wildfire  wildfire  you wouldnt lie to me would you cousin   no  thats a lie right there  it is not a lie why would i lie  tell me  if the vile allegations  against my brother and sister are true  do you think it will make jaime more likely  to kill you or less likely  when i tell him youre fucking her i mean  im telling you the truth  the smart money would be on more likely  shes making wildfire  but then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours  the alchemists guild is being commissioned  i suppose theres only one way to find out  they have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults  they are planning to launch them from the city walls  into stanniss ships and armies  please  when did she tell you this  i heard her talking with the pyromancer  and the other night after i left her  she went to meet him   i swear to you  swear to me on what   on my life  but i dont care about your life  in the light of the seven  by all that is holy and right  i lancel lannister do solemnly vow  all right all right enough  even torturing you is boring  just get out  oh lancel tell my friend bronn  to please kill you if anything should happen to me  please kill me if anything should happen to lord tyrion  it will be my pleasure   your grace  what is it  your grace  im sorry about your brother your grace  i wanted to let you know that people grieve for him  your grace   fools love a fool  your grace  i grieve for him as well for the boy he was  not the man he grew to be  i need to speak to you about what i saw in that cave  i thought i made it clear to you thered be no need to  speak to me on this matter  your grace i  ive never known you to need to hear a thing twice  and ive never known you to hide from the truth  youve come to lecture me on truth  ive come to tell you that what i saw  all my brothers bannermen have come to my side  except the tyrells who fled like cowards  they wont be able to resist us now  soon i shall be sitting on the iron throne  nothing is worth what this will cost you   not even the iron  ill hear no more about it  take a company of men secure the perimeter  when do we sail for kings landing  as soon as ive consolidated my troops  well make short work of the lannisters fleet  once blackwater bay is cleared  well deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city  and will you bring lady melisandre with you  thats not your concern  if you take kings landing with her by your side the victory will be hers  i never thought id have reason to doubt your loyalty was i wrong  loyal service means telling hard truths  oh truth again  all right whats the truth  the hard truth  shes a foreigner  preaching her foreign religion  some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey  what do you believe  you won those bannermen from renly  dont lose them to her  we set out for kings landing without lady melisandre  and you lead the fleet into blackwater bay  your grace im honored but my time on the sea  was spent evading ships not attacking them  the other lords wont be happy  most of those lords should consider themselves lucky  i dont hang them for treason  hard truths cut both ways ser davos  ive got it ive got it  so its that one there at the top on the right  buy my fruit my lord fresh fruit  stannis has more infantry  more ships more horses  what do we have  theres that mind of yours you keep going on about  well ive never actually been able to kill people with it  good thing id be out of a job  what about your father  he hasnt sent a raven in weeks  hes very busy  being repeatedly humiliated by robb stark is timeconsuming  we wont be able to hold the city against stannis  not the way joffreys planning on holding it  corruption yes  we are swollen bloated foul  brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings  and were surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten  yes a rotten king  its hard to argue with his assessment  not after what he did to your birthday present  the king is a lost cause  its the rest of us im worried about now  a dancing king prancing down his bloodstained halls  to the tune of a twisted demon monkey  you have to admire his imagination   hes talking about you  what  demon monkey  people think youre pulling the kings strings  they blame you for the citys ills  blame me im trying to save them  you dont need to convince me  demon monkey   seagulls screeching  yeah come on  youre the crew of the sea bitch  im your commander welcome  stop  stop  your captain commands you to stop  where are we heading captain  the stony shore to raid their villages  therell be spoils in it for you and women  if you do your jobs well  and who decides if weve done our jobs well  i do  your captain  i have been reaving and raping  since before you left balons balls captain  dont reckon ive got much use for your ideas on how to do it  dont reckon ive got much use for a captain at all  im thinking i can do the job of captain real well myself  all i need is a ship  you wouldnt know where i could find myself  a ship now would you  you could do that  take the ship head out on your own  and i will hunt you down drag you back here in chains  and hang you for a traitor  stop we yield  congratulations on your first command  thank you kind of you to come see me off  oh im not here for you  i was just on my way to red harbor  ive got 30 ships theres nowhere to put them here   too narrow  youd better get out there  wouldnt want them to set sail without you  that would never happen  my crew would wait on deck for a year if i asked them to  this lot though  enjoy the stony shore  come on ill take you out  who are you  dagmer your first mate  why arent you with the rest of them  or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea  that would be good for a laugh  theyre not gonna respect you until you prove yourself  and how am i supposed to prove myself by pillaging  pisspoor fishing villages  youre not  and yet thats the task my father has given me  to prove that im a true iron islander  theyre all iron islanders  do they do as theyre told or do they do as they like  the stony shores not far from torrhens square  the seat of the house of tallhart  a more impressive prize than a few fishermens daughters  what you dont think we could take it  no we could  we could never hold it for more than a few days  as soon as winterfell got word that wed taken torrhens square  the starks would send their men to take it back  and then  take me to my ship  the starks have overextended their lines  now that summers over theyll have a hard time  keeping their men and horses fed  the starks understand winter better than we ever will  the cold wont beat them  our spies report growing discontent among the northern lords  they want to return home  and gather the harvest before the crops turn  and im sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments  they would report growing discontent amongst the southern lords  this is war no ones content  weve underestimated the stark boy for too long  he has a good mind for warfare his men worship him  and as long as he keeps winning battles  theyll keep believing he is king in the north  youve been waiting for him to fail  he is not going to fail  not without our help  so how do we stop him  weve worked through the night my lord  perhaps wed profit from some sleep  as i think you would reginald  and because youre my cousin  i might even let you wake from that sleep  go im sure your wife must miss you  my wifes in lannisport  well then youd better start riding  go before i change my mind and send her your head  if your name wasnt lannister  youd be scrubbing out pots in the cooks tent go  not wine water  well be here for some time  girl  where are you from  maidenpool my lord  and who are the lords of maidenpool   remind me  house mooton my lord  and what is their sigil  a red salmon  i think a maidenpool girl would remember that  youre a northerner arent you  good one more time where are you from  barrowton my lord house dustin  two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown  and what do they say of robb stark in the north  they call him the young wolf  and  they say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf  they say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants  they say he cant be killed  and do you believe them  no my lord  anyone can be killed  fetch that water  a girl says nothing  a girl keeps her mouth closed  no one hears  and friends may talk in secret yes  a boy becomes a girl  i was always a girl  and i was always aware  but the girl keeps secrets  it is not for a man to spoil them  youre one of them now  i should have let you burn  and you fetch water for one of them now  why is this right for you and wrong for me  i didnt have a choice  you did i did  and here we are  a man pays his debts  a man owes three  three what  the red god takes what is his lovely girl  and only death may pay for life  you saved me and the two i was with  you stole three deaths from the red god  we have to give them back  speak three names  and the man will do the rest  three lives i will give you  no more no less and were done  i can name anyone  and youll kill him  a man has said  the one who tortures everyone  a man needs a name  i dont know his name  they call him the tickler  that is enough  go now girl your master is thirsty  hes not here yet  hed have seen us blown the horn  when will he come  the halfhand does things in his own time  my uncle told me stories about him  most of them are true  i heard the halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the wall  the whole winter  he was north of the skirling pass when the snows came  had to wait for the thaw  so it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own  well possible for the halfhand  beautiful isnt it  gilly would love it here  theres nothing more sickening than a man in love  about time you did something  at least youll keep warm  the fist of the first men  think of how old this place is  before the targaryens defeated the hendals  before the andals took westeros from the first men  before i die please stop talking  thousands and thousands of years ago  the first men stood here where were standing  all through the long night  what do you think they were like the first men  stupid  smart people dont find themselves in places like this  i think they were afraid  i think they came here to get away from something  and i dont think it worked  wildlings  one blast is for rangers returning  wildlings is two blasts  so you got to stand there waiting  wondering  one blast for friends  two for foes  and three for white walkers  its been 1000 years  but thats the only time they blow the horn three times  but if its been 1000 years how do you know   well  i read it in a book  look  its qhorin halfhand  aye well live another day  hurrah  take care my lord  i remember reading an old sailors proverb  piss on wildfire and your cock burns off  oh i have not conducted this experiment  it could well be true  the substance burns so hot  it melts wood stone even steel  and of course flesh  the substance burns so hot it melts flesh like tallow  after the dragons died wildfire was the key  to the targaryen power  my companion takes issue  if i could tell you how many crazy old men  ive seen pushing carts around army camps  making grand claims about jars full of pig shit   no offense meant  our order does not deal in pig shit  the substance is fire given form  and we have been perfecting it since the days of maegor  to do what  the jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy  how much do you have  if you could get real soldiers to man the catapults  then maybe youd hit your target one time in 10  but all the real soldiers are in the riverlands with your father  my lord this man is insulting  i dont know if youve ever seen a battle old man  but things can get a bit messy  cause when were flinging things at stannis  hes flinging them right back at us  men die men shit themselves men run  which means pots falling  which means fire inside the walls  which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city  end up burning it down  my friend remains unconvinced  he would not dare insult my order  whilst aerys targaryen lived  well hes not living anymore  and all his pots of wildfire didnt help him did they  men win wars not magic tricks  we have been working tirelessly day and night  ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so  our present count stands  at 7811  enough to burn stannis baratheons fleet  and armies both  this is a shit idea  im afraid i have to concur with my advisor wisdom hallyne  the contents of this room could lay kings landing low  you wont be making wildfire for my sister any longer  youll be making it for me  dracarys  dracarys  hell be able to feed himself from now on  let him sleep doreah  yes khaleesi  he loves you  thank you my friend  did you see the dress xaro had made for you  they say hes the wealthiest man in qarth  it is known  and if qarth is the wealthiest city in essos  the last time a rich man gave me a dress  he was selling me to khal drogo  xaro is our host but we know nothing about him  men like to talk about other men  when theyre happy  you would look like a real princess in xaros  shes not a princess shes a khaleesi  you should wear it khaleesi  you are their guest  it would be rude not to  and you must visit the night market  the qartheen night market is like no night market youve ever seen  it sounds wonderful  the meereens think they have a night market  i will take you there myself  please excuse me for a moment  what are they doing  malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry  kovarro says that malakko is an idiot  they can pry out the gems the rest is pure gold  very soft he can chop off as much as we can carry  my brother used to say the only thing the dothraki knew how to do  was steal things better men have built  its not the only thing  theyre quite good at killing the better men  thats not the kind of queen im going to be  mother of dragons  on behalf of the warlocks of qarth  i welcome you  a demonstration  take this gem look at it  into its depths  so many facets  look closely enough and you can see yourself in them  often more than once  should you grow tired of xaros baubles and trinkets  it would be an honor to host you at the house of the undying  youre always welcome  mother of dragons  my apologies  pyat pree is one of the thirteen  it was customary for me to extend him an invitation  customs die slow deaths in qarth  what is the house of the undying  it is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books  and drink shade of the evening  it turns their lips blue and their minds soft  so soft they actually believe  their parlor tricks are magic  you watch over her  do i know you  i know you  jorah mormont of bear island  who are you  im no one  but she is the mother of dragons  she needs true protectors now more than ever  they shall come day and night  to see the wonder born into the world again  and when they see they shall lust  for dragons are fire made flesh  and fire is power  it looked like stannis  to me it just looked like  a shadow in the shape of a man  in the shape of stannis  we should reach my sons camp tomorrow  will you stay there long my lady  only long enough to tell robb what i have seen  after that i will leave for winterfell  my two youngest need me  ive been away from them for far too long  i never knew my mother  im sorry  my own mother died on the birthing bed  when i was very young  its a bloody business  what comes after is even harder  once youre safely back amongst your own people  will you give me leave to go my lady  you mean to kill stannis  i swore a vow  but stannis has a great army around him  his own guards are sworn to keep him safe  im as good as any of them  i should never have fled  renlys death was no fault of yours  you served him bravely  i only held him that once  as he was dying  hes gone brienne  you serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth  renlys enemies are robbs enemies as well  i do not know your son my lady  but i could serve you if you would have me  you have courage  not battle courage perhaps  but i dont know  a womans kind of courage  and i think that when the time comes  you will not hold me back  promise me that you will not hold me back  from stannis  when the time comes i will not hold you back  then i am yours my lady  i will shield your back  and give my life for yours if it comes to that  i swear it by the old gods and the new  i vow that you shall always have a place in my home  and at my table  and that i shall ask no service of you  that might bring you dishonor  i swear it by the old gods and the new  and its not just thieves my lord  theres wolves in them hills now  more than ive ever seen  they come down in the night and they kill my sheep  my three sons is away fighting for your brother my lord  theyll fight keep fighting  till theyre told to go home  i have no one to man my flock now only me  i cant keep watch all day and all night  we can send two orphan boys from winterstown home with you  to help watch over your flock  if you can give them room and board  my wife always prayed for more children  well look after them thank you my lord  and may the gods bless you and yours  stop it  if thats everyone im going to go for a ride before dark   good  hodor   hodor bran lord stark  torrhens square is under siege  torrhens square is barely  how can the lannisters strike so far north  might be a raiding party led by the mountain  might be sellswords paid by tywin lannister  we have to help them  most of the fighting men are away with robb  but i can gather  do you need so many  if we cant protect our own bannermen  why should they protect us  go ser rodrik take the men you need  wont take long my lord  southerners dont do well up here  so what does it mean  ask your maester luwin  hes the one studying books all the time  i did ask him hed never heard of a threeeyed raven   must not mean anything then  youre lying  you might be a little lord but dont you call me a liar   you know what it means  i never said i didnt  you didnt give me an honest answer  thats not the same as being a liar  well its not far off  so youve been dreaming of a threeeyed raven again  in the godswood you told me you didnt dream  now whos a liar  what did you see in your dream  something bad  tell me boy  i dreamt that the sea came to winterfell  i saw waves crashing against the gates  and the water came flowing over the walls  flooded the castle  drowned men were floating here  in the yard  ser rodrik was one of them  the sea is hundreds of miles away  i know  its just a stupid dream  ive got to get these potatoes to the kitchen  otherwise theyll put me in chains again  osha  the threeeyed raven  what do they say about it  north of the wall  they say all sorts of crazy things north of the wall   there  where  on that mountain  i dont see very well  a fire  theres a fire  the people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine  when they see us coming that fire becomes a signal  gives mance rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honor  how many wildlings have joined him  from what we can tell all of them  mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves  theyre almost ready to make their move  where  somewhere safe  somewhere south  cant just march into their midst  and we cant wait for them here with nothing but a pile  of stones to protect us  you saying we should fall back to the wall  mance was one of us once  now hes one of them  hes gonna teach them our way of doing things  theyll hit us in force  and they wont run away when we hit back  theyre gonna be more organized than before  more disciplined  more like us  so we need to be more like them  do things their way  sneak in kill mance  and scatter them to the winds  before they can march on the wall  and to do that  we need to get rid of those lookouts  its not a job for 400 men  i need to move fast and silent  harker stonesnake borba  lord commander id like to join lord qhorin  ive been called lots of things  but that might be my first lord qhorin  youre a steward snow not a ranger  ive fought and killed a wight  how many rangers can say that  hes the one  aye you killed a wight  you also let an old man  beat you bloody and take your sword  craster  in the boys defense thats a tough old goat  i could take up jons duties while hes gone my lord  it would be no trouble  well i hope you make a better ranger  than you do a steward  go on  so tell me  how long has your manservant been in love with you  hes not my manservant and hes not in love with me  hes my advisor  my friend  unlikely  i can almost always tell what a man wants  and what about what a woman wants  much more complicated  you for example  what do you want  to cross the narrow sea and take back the iron throne  why  because i promised my khalasar id protect them  and find them a safe home  you want to conquer the seven kingdoms  i want them because theyre mine by right  the iron throne is mine and i will take it  ah a conqueror  and how did you get all of this   did someone give it to you  no  i come from nothing  i hit the docks like a piece of cargo  except someone normally cares what happens to cargo  so you wanted more than you had and you took it  youre a conqueror too youre just less ambitious  mmm  what do you want xaro zhoan daxos  at the gates of the city you bled for me  why  i will show you why  the door and the vault is made of valyrian stone  the hardest steel does not make a mark  i offered the greatest locksmiths in qarth  their weight in gold if they could break into it  i made the same offer to the greatest thieves  they all went home emptyhanded  the only thing that can open this door  is this key  and behind the door  and it can all be mine  all  let us say half  more than enough to buy horses ships armies  enough to go home  all i have to do  is marry me  that was a romantic proposal  ive already married once for love  but the gods stole her from me  i come from nothing  my mother and father never owned a pair of shoes  but marry me and i will give you the seven kingdoms  and our children will be princes and princesses  see  i have more ambition than you thought  the time is right daenerys targaryen  first of your name  robert baratheon is dead  if you cross the sea with an army you bought  the seven kingdoms are at war with one another  four false kings destroying the country  to win westeros you need support from westeros  the usurper is dead  the starks fight the lannisters  and baratheons fight each other  according to your new friend  who earned your trust by cutting his hand  the time to strike is now we need to find ships and an army  or well spend the rest of our lives rotting away  at the edge of the world  rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get  theyll give you ships and soldiers and theyll own you forever  moving carefully is the hard way but its the right way  and if id listened to that advice  outside the gates of qarth wed all be dead by now  i know the opportunity before you seems like the last youll ever have  but you must  do not speak to me like im a child   i only want  what do you want  tell me  to see you on the iron throne   why  you have a good claim  a title a birthright  but you have something more than that  you may cover it up and deny it but you have a gentle heart  you would not only be respected and feared  you would be loved  someone who can rule and should rule  centuries come and go without a person like that  coming into the world  there are times when i look at you  and still cant believe youre real  so what would you have me do as my advisor  make your own way  find your own ship you only need one  the allies we need are in westeros not qarth  and how do i get the ship  ill find it for you  a sound ship with a good captain  i look forward to meeting him  khaleesi  you should stand sideface  sideface  sideways   why  smaller target  am i fighting someone  youre practicing for a fight  you should practice right  guards   help  did you see anything  go up there go and see where he fell from  go up the back  that is strange  move away  stand back hes dead
