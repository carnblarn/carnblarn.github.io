greater and the lesser houses  its the one on the  my cupbearer can read better than you  to whom does house dormand owe allegiance  my lord i  to the starks of winterfell  who have 20000 men and my son  i judged you might be good for something more  than brutalizing peasants  i see i overestimated you  if you ever put my sons life at risk again ill  leave us  put the book away girl  maybe you should devise our next battle plan while youre about it   lord petyr baelish  hmmm  give us the room  clear all this   lord tywin  baelish   wine  thank you  what news from the capital  i travelled here directly from renly baratheons camp  ah the late king renly  rather a short reign  murdered by a woman i hear  so they say  there has been talk of other forces at work  dark forces  here  men love to blame demons  when their grand plans unravel  it is my belief that a moment of chaos  affords opportunities lost soon after  you say that as if you were the first man alive to think it  yes a crisis is an opportunity  what other brilliant insights have you brought me today  after the lannisters and the starks  the tyrells command the largest host  their lands are the most fertile in the seven kingdoms   feeding horses and soldiers  yes yes yes  the tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings  loras wants revenge he blames stannis for renlys death  and margaery  wants to be queen  yes she does  house tyrell rebelled against the iron throne   against my grandson  they did  and perhaps that treason should be punished  one day  after stannis and robb stark are defeated  more wine for lord baelish  if you will allow me to represent your familys interests  i believe that an advantageous agreement  the tyrell host has returned to highgarden  they have  pardon my lord  its only wine  you would ride there yourself  tonight with your leave  ill have an answer by nightfall  thatll be all girl  what else  on your son tyrions directive  i met with catelyn stark

them all  theyre starving you fool  all because of a war you started  youre talking to a king  and now ive struck a king  did my hand fall from my wrist  where is the stark girl  let them have her  if

my orders from the king  this way  please  no no  please  youre all right now little bird  youre all right   well get you well get you  this way  are you hurt my lady  the little birds bleeding  someone take her back to her cage  see to that cut  well done clegane  i didnt do it for you  he shouldnt make me wait  the spice king is the second wealthiest man in qarth  he makes everyone wait  of course you could have avoided this embarrassment  if you married the wealthiest man in qarth  i already have a husband  khal drogo is gone khaleesi  you are far too young to be a widow forever  and far too beautiful  and you are far too smart  to think that i will succumb to flattery  i have travelled very far in my life  and met many women  but none that are immune to flattery   the mother of dragons  ah  here he comes  forgive me i had terrible dreams last night  terrible dreams  i could not sleep until the sun was shining  and the birds were singing  look what a beauty you are  now the red waste has been washed off you  i am sorry about all that unpleasantness  the silver hair of a true targaryen  xaro xhoan daxos she is far too lovely  for a glorified dockworker like yourself  very true and yet they say that your grandfather  who sold pepper off the back of a wagon  married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself  every lady alive was lovelier  and higher born than my grandfather  ahem  did my servants not offer you something to eat to drink  ill have them flogged in the square  thank you my lord you are a gracious host  but there is no servant alive that can bring me what i want  oh she has a talent for drama this one  so my little princess what is it you want  my birthright  the seven kingdoms of westeros  i fear im no better than a servant in this regard  i cannot give you what i do not have  im not asking you for the kingdoms  im asking you for ships  i need to cross the narrow sea  i need my ships as well  i use them you see  to bring spices from one port to another  whatever you grant me now will be repaid  three times over when i retake the iron throne  retake  did you once sit on the iron throne  my father sat there before he was murdered  but if you did not sit on it yourself  would it not be correct to say take the iron throne  i didnt come here to argue grammar  of course not you came to take my ships  so let me explain my position  little princess  unlike you i do not have exalted ancestors  i make my living by trade  and i judge every trade on its merits  you ask for ships  you say i shall be repaid triple  i do not doubt your honesty or your intentions  but before you repay your debts  you must seize the seven kingdoms   do you have an army  not yet  you do not have an army  do you have powerful allies in westeros  there are many there that support my claim  when were you there last  i left when i was a baby  so in truth you have no allies  the people will rise to fight for their rightful  queen when i return  ah  forgive me little princess  but i cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams  now if youll pardon me  do you know illyrio mopatis magister of pentos  yes weve met a shrewd man  for my wedding he gave me three petrified dragon eggs  he believed the world believed  that the ages had turned them to stone  how many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies  but i dreamt that if i carried those eggs  into a great fire they would hatch  when i stepped into the fire my own people thought i was mad  but when the fire burned out  i was unhurt  the mother of dragons  do you understand  im no ordinary woman  my dreams come true  i admire your passion  but in business i trust in logic not passion  im sorry little princess  i am not your little princess  i am daenerys stormborn of the blood of old valyria  and i will take what is mine  with fire and blood i will take it  yes my lady but not with my ships  who taught you to read  my father my lord  hmm  i taught my son jaime to read  the maester came to me one day  told me he wasnt learning  he couldnt make sense of the letters  he reversed them in his head  the maester said hed heard tell of this affliction  and that we simply must accept it  ha  after that i sat jaime down  for four hours every day until he learned  he hated me for it for a time  for a long time  but he learned  where is your father is he alive  who was he  a stonemason  a stonemason who could read   hmm  he taught himself  quite a man  what killed him  loyalty  youre a sharp little thing arent you  did  forgive me my lord i shouldnt ask questions  no  but youve already begun  did you know your father my lord  i did  i grew up with him  i watched him grow old  he loved us  he was a good man  but a weak man  a weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name  im cold  ill fetch more wood for the fire my lord  mmm  where are you going girl  the armory my lord  why  lord tywin sent me  what might this be  lord tywin gave it to me  what for  to take to the armory  why would he do that  lets go and ask him  move  get out of the way  amory lorch  a girl has named a second name  a man will do what must be done  now  a girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing  a man cannot make a thing happen before its time  but hes going to tell tywin hes getting away  it has to be now  guard   your grace  your grace  my honor your grace  your grace   your grace  quent  lady talisa  your grace  im not sure im a lady  westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me  its hard to keep all the rules straight  but if i remember my lessons  a woman of noble birth is always called a lady  unless shes a queen or a princess  i could find someone who knows  why are you so sure im of noble birth  because its obvious  what if i told you my father sold lace on the long bridge  and my mother my brother and i lived with him above our shop  id call you a liar  not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty  i always thought i was a brilliant liar  better at amputations im afraid  quite a pretty spot  will we be here long  i couldnt really discuss troop movements with you  im not a spy  of course a spy would deny being a spy  youre right youve found me out  im writing a letter to the lannisters  the young wolf is on the move  perhaps youd join me  if youve got time of course for well  robb  mother  mother this is lady talisa  shes been helping with the wounded  shes been very helpful  lady talisa  lady stark  lady talisa   maegyr  maegyr  forgive me i do not know this name  an uncommon name here an old name in volantis  excuse me my lady your grace  ive missed you  yes you look positively forlorn  you surprised me thats all  i didnt think id see you today  i wish that you were free to follow your heart  i know  you have inherited your fathers responsibilities  im afraid they come at a cost   i know  you are promised to another  a debt that must be paid   i havent forgotten  your grace  my lady news from winterfell  your brothers desert you  i can tell you which way to go  well stop here  too dark to go any farther today  here theres no shelter here  theres no shelter anywhere  there is if you know where to look  the cold could kill us both   if you light a fire  no fire   but a fire is  no fire  have it your way  well stay warmer if we stay close  bet you freeze to death before i do  bet your life  think theyre out looking for you   yes  think theyll find you  yes  youre brave  stupid  but brave  we start again at first light get some sleep  stop moving  im just trying to get comfortable  stop it   youre still moving  was i  i didnt notice that time  this cannot be true  weve had ravens from white harbor  barrowton and the dreadfort  im afraid it is true  why why would theon  because the greyjoys are treasonous whores   my brothers  weve heard nothing of them  but rodrik cassel is dead  i told you never trust a greyjoy  i must go north at once  theres still a war to win your grace  how can i call myself king if i cant hold my own castle  how can i ask men to follow me if i cant  you are a king  and that means you dont have to do everything yourself  let me go and talk to theon  there will be no talk he will die for this  theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew  let me send word to my bastard at the dreadfort  he can raise a few hundred men and retake winterfell before the new moon  we have the lannisters on the run  if you march all the way back north now youll lose what you gained  my boy would be honored to bring you prince theons head  tell your son bran and rickons safety is paramount  and theon i want him brought to me alive  i want to look him in the eye and ask him why  and then ill take his head myself  why on earth would i trust the word of a lying little savage like you  im no liar  all wildlings are liars and savages  with no loyalty to anything or anyone  i done what i had to do to stay alive  i hate the starks as well as you do  let me serve you my lord  how and dont tell me to put a spear in your hand  there are other ways to serve my lord  im a prince now and youd do well  there are other ways to serve my prince  like what  we know things the free people  you know things  like what  how to eat dirt  other things  savage things  wait outside  i always wondered what you had under there  it comes at a price  im not killing you thats your price  i already had that  what do you want then  other than your miserable life  what all free people want  my freedom  well you shall have it then  but only if you serve me well   ow  shh   its not deep  i thought they were going to kill me  they thought so too  he hated me the man who hit me  i saw it in his eyes hated me  he never met me before  but he wanted to hurt me   of course he did  why why would a stranger  you are everything he will never have  your horse eats better than his children  it doesnt matter now hes dead  i would have given them bread if i had it  i hate the king more than any of them  dont say these things  if the wrong people hear you  but youre not the wrong people  dont trust anybody  life is safer that way  and where are you going  i have something for you from prince theon   what  me  he says im to make the rounds  and keep you warm  the spice king refuses me because im a bad investment  the silk king wont support me  because of his business with the lannisters  why offend his best customer  and the copper king offers me a single ship  on the condition that i lie with him for a night  does he think i will whore myself for a boat  when i came to this city i had nothing  truly nothing  i slept by the docks  and when i could find work loading the ships i would eat  if not i dreamed of food  today i am the richest man in qarth  do you think the path from poverty to wealth  is always pure and honorable  i have done many things khaleesi  that a righteous man would condemn  and here i am with no regrets  bar the gates ring the bells  slowly khaleesi  where are they  where are my dragons
