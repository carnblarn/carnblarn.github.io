                1 our father has instructed us to tell you  that his alliance with the north can continue  if his terms are met  lord frey requires lord edmure  to wed one of his daughters  its hard to say which of the four of us  is getting the worst of this arrangement  probably sansa  though loras will certainly come to know  a deep and singular misery  whos going to tell her  good afternoon lord tyrion  i was just trying on a gown for king joffreys wedding  yes it should be quite a wedding  i will allow you to go to kings landing  as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made  and you will swear to tell your father  that i had nothing to do with your maiming   my lady  she wont be going with you  _  _  _  lets play a game  which body part do you need the least   how many times has the lord brought him back  six  he sent you to us for a reason  you have someone he needs  you told me i could be one of you  you told me this was a brotherhood  you will make kings rise and fall  the visions take their toll  hes having one now   i saw jon snow  at castle black  he was on the wrong side of the wall  surrounded by enemies   how far are we  about a week i think  you think you dont know  when we went to castle black we took the kingsroad  you and your roads  is that how you lot do your fighting  you march down the road banging drums and waving banners  most of the time yes  how do the men holding the banners fight  they dont really  its a great honor to carry your house sigil  and the drummers is that a great honor too  usually its the young boys banging the drums  so what good are they   they help the men march  how  well its its the rhythm  oh you mean right foot left foot  right foot left foot right foot  you need help remembering that  when mance gives the signal and we hit castle black  we wont be banging on drums to let them know were coming  no  no youre just gonna light the biggest fire  the north has ever seen to let them know youre coming  you know nothing jon snow  shes right you dont  i know you cut me loose on the wall  cut her loose too  do you see her sulking about it  thats because she understands the way things are  and are you gonna share it with me  the deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird  people work together when it suits them  theyre loyal when it suits them  they love each other when it suits them  and they kill each other when it suits them  she knows that you dont  which is why youll never hold onto her  that rain will cost us another day  frey will wait he knows were coming  lord walder is prickly by nature  prickly that what you call it  might be the least pleasant man ive ever met   yes and that is why  ive seen wet shits  i liked better than walder frey  apologies your grace  spent too many years around lancers and pikemen  ive spent the last two years nursing wounded men  watching them bleed and die  im not afraid of wet shits  lord frey will take this delay as a slight  he can take it as he likes  hes getting the wedding he wanted  hes getting a wedding  it was a king he wanted  edmure is the best match a frey has had  in the history of their house  we should all get some sleep  if

hair and his pretty eyes   you think pretty is gonna make you happy  dont touch me  you wont love him so much when you find out what he really is  growing up at winterfell all i ever wanted was to escape  to come here to the capital  see the southern knights and their painted armor  and kings landing after dark  all the candles burning in all those windows  im stupid  a stupid little girl  with stupid dreams who never learns  come on  come walk with me  i remember the first time i saw you in the throne room  id never seen anyone who looked so unhappy  i want very much for you to be happy sansa  and so does my grandmother  you would have been happy at highgarden  but women in our position  must make the best of our circumstances  how do i make the best of my circumstances  i have to marry him   has lord tyrion mistreated you  no  has he been kind to you  hes tried  you dont want him though  hes a lannister  far from the worst lannister wouldnt you say  im sorry  here i am complaining to you  my son will be king  sons learn from their mothers  i plan to teach mine a great deal  and your son if im not mistaken  your son might be the lord of casterly rock  and the north someday  what  my son  with him  ill have to  well have to  if its the pain youre worried about  im not afraid of the pain  not after what joffreys done to me  what is it then  hes rather goodlooking even with the scar  especially with the scar  hes a dwarf  and loras  loras  some women like tall men  some like short men  some like hairy men some like bald men  gentle men rough men ugly men pretty men  pretty girls  most women dont know what they like until theyve tried it  and sadly so many of us get to try so little  before were old and gray  tyrion may surprise you  from what ive heard hes quite experienced  and thats a good thing  it can be  were very complicated you know  pleasing us takes practice  how do you know all this  did your mother teach you  yes sweet girl my mother taught me  shes a child  shes a foot taller than you  a tall child  whats the youngest youve ever had  not that young  how much older  older  youre a lord shes a lady  and a beauty at that  i dont see the problem  shae isnt going to like it  shae is a whore  are you gonna marry her eh  how did marrying a whore work out for you the first time  i should never have told you about that  you want shae keep her wed one and bed the other  all you have to do is get a son in the stark girl  hell be lord of winterfell one day  you can rule the north in his name  youll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own  two women to despise me  and a whole kingdom to join them  you waste time trying to get people to love you  youll end up the most popular dead man in town  you want to fuck that stark girl  you just dont want to admit it  i dont pay you to put evil notions in my head  the ones already there dont need company  you pay me to kill people who bother you  evil notions come free  your grace  grandfather  you wanted to speak to me  yes  id like a report on the meetings of my small council  youre welcome to attend the meetings  of your small council your grace  any or all of them  ive been very busy  many important matters require a kings attention  of course  youve been holding the council meetings  in the tower of the hand instead of the small council chamber  i have yes  may i ask why  the tower of the hand is where i work  to walk from there to here would take time  time i could otherwise spend productively  so if i wanted to attend a council meeting  i would now have to climb all the stairs in the tower of the hand  we could arrange to have you carried  tell me about the targaryen girl  in the east and her dragons  where did you hear about this  is it true  apparently so  dont you think we ought to do something about it  when i was hand of the king  under your fathers predecessor  the skulls of all the targaryen dragons  were kept in this room  the skull of the last of them  was right here  it was the size of an apple  and the biggest was the size of a carriage  yes and the creature to whom it belonged  died 300 years ago  curiosities on the far side of the world  are no threat to us  but how do we know these dragons are just curiosities  and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel  because we have been told as much by the many experts  who serve the realm by counseling the king  on matters about which he knows nothing  but i havent been counseled  you are being counseled at this very moment  i should be consulted about such things  from now on i will see to it  that you are appropriately consulted  on important matters  whenever necessary  your grace  yunkai  the yellow city  the yunkish train bed slaves not soldiers  we can defeat them  on the field with ease  but they wont meet us on the field  they have provisions patience and strong walls  if theyre wise theyll hide behind those walls  and chip away at us man by man  i dont want half my army killed before ive crossed the narrow sea  we dont need yunkai khaleesi  taking this city will not bring you any closer to westeros  or the iron throne  how many slaves are there in yunkai   then we have 200000 reasons to take the city  _  _  _  now comes the noble razdal mo eraz  of that ancient and honorable house  master of men and speaker to savages  to offer terms of peace  noble lord you are in the presence  of daenerys stormborn of house targaryen  queen of the andals and the first men  khaleesi of the great grass sea  breaker of chains and mother of dragons  you may approach sit  will the noble lord take refreshment  ancient and glorious is yunkai  our empire was old  before dragons stirred in old valyria  many an army has broken against our walls  you shall find no easy conquest here khaleesi  good my unsullied need practice  i was told to blood them early  if blood is your desire blood shall flow  but why  tis true you have committed savageries in astapor  but the yunkai are a forgiving and generous people  the wise masters of yunkai have sent a gift  for the silver queen  there is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship   my ship  yes khaleesi  as i said we are a generous people  you shall have as many ships as you require  and what do you ask in return  all we ask is that you make use of these ships  sail them back to westeros where you belong  and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace  i have a gift for you as well   your life  my life  and the lives of your wise masters  but i also want something in return  you will release every slave in yunkai  every man woman and child shall be given as much food  clothing and property as they can carry  as payment for their years of servitude  reject this gift  and i shall show you no mercy  you are mad  we are not astapor or qarth  we are yunkai and we have powerful friends  friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you  those who survive we shall enslave once more  perhaps well make a slave of you as well  you swore me safe conduct  i did but my dragons made no promises  and you threatened their mother  take the gold  my gold you gave it to me remember  and i shall put it to good use  youd be wise to do the same with my gift to you  now get out  the yunkish are a proud people  they will not bend  and what happens to things that dont bend  he said he had powerful friends  who was he talking about  i dont know  find out  chains  solid gold from the mines outside lannisport  smithed in casterly rock  golden chains  you could buy a ship with these   do i need a ship  what   am i going somewhere  of course youre not going anywhere  so am i invited to your wedding  i didnt ask for this marriage   i didnt want it  no  shes a beautiful girl you said so yourself  that doesnt mean that  this is duty not desire  is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her  i dont have a choice my father  does not rule the world  we can still go across the narrow sea  what would i do there  juggle  i am a lannister of casterly rock  and im shae the funny whore  my feelings for you have not changed  i will marry sansa stark and do my duty by her  while i empty her chamber pot  and lick your cock when youre bored  i swear to you it will not be like that  no what will it be like  i will buy you a good home somewhere in the city  you will have fine clothes  guards to keep you safe servants  any children we might have  will be well provided for  children you think i want children  who can never see their father  who would be killed in their sleep  if their grandfather found out about them  listen  listen to me my lady   im not your lady  you are  youll always be my lady  im your whore  and when you are tired of fucking me  i will be nothing   what happened  wildfire  i should have been here  after all the running and fighting  here i am back where i started  do you miss it   kings landing  your fathers house  never had a father never wanted one  havent you ever wondered where your strength came from  your talent for fighting  im lowborn  as low as can be my mother was a tavern wench  mine was a slave  so was i  bought

know that  every boy in the north knows it  we grow up learning it  where the battles were fought  the names of the heroes who died where  six times youve invaded  and six times youve failed  the seventh will be the same   mance is different  you dont have the discipline  you dont have the training your army is no army  you dont know how to fight together   you dont know that  i do  i know it  if you attack the wall youll die  all of you  all of us  youre mine  as im yours  and if we die we die  but first well live  yes first well live  whats he going on about  and how come he always gets to sit and chat  while we do all the work  hodor   thats where we are  what are you telling him   its all right osha  its not all right  you think i cant hear you every day  filling his head with black magic  talking about visions and threeeyed ravens and worse   leave him alone  he can speak for himself  i dont fill his head with anything  so what do you talk about  whats happening to him and what that means  go on then tell us what it means  its not like that  i wish i could tell him all the answers  it would be much easier  i dont want you talking to him anymore  until we get to your brother at castle black   were not going to castle black  what did you say  i told you already jon snow isnt there  bran needs to find the raven beyond the wall  oh no im not going back there  your

have now  you have a family  you need to go back to castle black  so you can get back to them where you belong  what if i belong in the north  what if i fell from that tower for a reason  is that what hes telling you  that its all for a reason  all these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you  i wish it were true little lord  but the gods wouldnt spare a ravens cold shit for you or me or anyone  you dont understand you dont know  you dont know none of you know  none of you have been up there  i had a man once  a good man  bruni his name was  i was his and he was mine  but one night bruni disappears  people said he left me  but i knew him  hed never leave me not for long  i knew hed come back  and he did  he came in through the back of the hut  only it wasnt bruni  not really  his skin was pale  like a dead mans  his eyes bluer than clear sky  he came at me  grabbed me by the neck  and squeezed so hard  i could feel the life slipping out of me  i dont know how i got the knife  when i did i stuck it  deep into his heart  and he hardly seemed to notice  i had to burn our hut down with him inside  i didnt ask the gods what it meant  i didnt need to i already knew  it meant the north was no place for men to be  not anymore  i promised your maester id get you to castle black  and no further  how is the pain my lord  whats the purpose of an arm with no hand  well weve stymied the corruption  yes weve stymied the corruption  youre a learned man  all the good its done me  you did well sewing up this mess  youre far better at this sort of work  than grand maester pycelle  faint praise my lord  so why did the citadel take your chain  did you fondle one boy too many  no my lord thats not my weakness  what is  curiosity  the only way to treat disease is to understand disease  and the only way to understand it  is to study the afflicted  you performed experiments on living men   on dying men  with their permission  my studies have given me insight  that has saved many lives  dying paupers i assume  men with no families to complain  you found them moaning in the poorhouse  and had them carted back to your garret  and opened up their bellies to see what was inside  how many men have you killed my lord  i dont know   countless  countless has a nice ring to it  and how many lives have you saved  half a million  the population of kings landing  you were in charge of the ravens at harrenhal  did you did you get a bird off to briennes father in tarth  a bird flew off and a bird flew back  lord selwyn tarth  offered 300 gold dragons for his daughters safe return   a fair offer  a fair offer locke wont take it  why not  hes convinced lord tarth  owns all the sapphire mines in westeros  he feels hes being cheated  theyd be fools to kill her  these men have been at war a long time  most of them will be dead by winter  shell be their entertainment tonight  beyond tonight  i dont think they care very much  we have to return to harrenhal  why  ive left something behind  absolutely not  ive got orders from lord bolton  and what are those orders  to deliver you to your father at kings landing  you think youll get a reward  i serve lord bolton  any appreciation your father  you think youre getting a reward  let me explain something to you  when my father sees me the first thing  hes going to ask is what happened to my hand  and im going to tell him this man chopped it off   i had nothing  or i could tell him this man saved my life  we return to harrenhal now  whoa   eyes open lads  be quiet  the bear the bear and the maiden fair   from there to here from here to there   all black and brown and covered in hair   he smelled that girl in the summer air   the bear the bear and the maiden fair   dont spare her  dont spare her  well this is one shameful fucking performance  stop running and fight  a wooden sword   i thought youd gone  you gave her a wooden sword  weve only got one bear  ill pay her bloody ransom  gold sapphires whatever you want  just get her out of there  all you lords and ladies  still think that the only thing that matters is gold  this makes me happier than all your gold ever could  and that makes me happier than all her sapphires  so go buy yourself a golden hand  and fuck yourself with it  ah   get behind me  i will not  what the fuck are you doing to my bear  lord bolton charged me with bringing him back  to kings landing alive and thats what i aim to do  pull her up  hold my legs  pull him up  the bitch stays  were taking her to kings landing  unless you kill me  she belongs to me  lord boltons orders  what do you think is more important to lord bolton  getting his pet rat a reward  or ensuring tywin lannister gets his son back alive  well we must be on our way  sorry about the sapphires
