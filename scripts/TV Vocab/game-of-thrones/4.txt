cowards  youre right im sorry  i just wanted to thank you  a bloody coward  people saw us talking to him  now theyll think were cowards too  youre too stupid to be a coward   youre too stupid to be a  quick now  before summers over  cmere  hyah hyah  vaes dothrak the city of the horselords  a pile of mud  mud and shit and twigs   best these savages can do  these are my people now  you shouldnt call them savages  ill call them what i like because theyre my people  this is my army  khal drogo is marching the wrong way with my army  if my brother was given an army of dothraki  could you conquer the seven kingdoms  the dothraki have never crossed the narrow sea  they fear any water their horses cant drink  but if they did  king robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle  but the men advising him are different   and you know these men  i fought beside them once  long ago  now ned stark wants my head  he drove me from my land  you sold slaves  aye   why  i had no money  and an expensive wife  and where is she now  in another place  with another man   your grace  yes my dear  they call you the last dragon  they do  you have dragons blood  in your veins  its entirely possible  what happened to the dragons  i was told that brave men killed them all  the brave men didnt kill dragons  the brave men rode them  rode them from valyria to build the greatest civilization  this world has ever seen  the breath of the greatest dragon  forged the iron throne  which the usurper is keeping warm for me  the swords of the vanquished  a thousand of them  melted together like so many candles  i have always wanted to see a dragon  there is nothing in the world that i would rather see  really why dragons  they can fly  and wherever they are just a few flaps of their wings  and theyre somewhere else  far away  and they can kill  anyone or anything that tries to hurt them  gets burned away to nothing  like so many candles  ow  yes seeing a dragon  would make me very happy  well after 15 years in a pleasure house  i imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy  i was not locked in i have seen things   what have you seen  ive seen  a man from asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass   ooh  ive seen a man who could  change his face the way that other men change their clothes  and ive seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold  and whose ship had sails of colored silk  so  have you seen one   a pirate ship  a dragon  no  no the last one died many years before i was born  ill tell you what i have seen  their skulls  they used to decorate the throne room in the red keep  when i was very young just three or four  my father used to walk me down the rows  and id recite their names for him  when i got them all right hed give me a sweet  the ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch  and they were all stunted and wrong  skulls no bigger than dog skulls  but as you got closer to the iron throne  they got bigger  and bigger and bigger  there was ghiscar  and valryon  vermithrax  essovius  archonei  meraxes  vhagar  and balerion the dread  whose fire forged  the seven kingdoms  into one  what happened to the skulls  i dont know  the usurper had them smashed to powder i expect  scattered to the wind  thats very sad  yes it is  what did i buy you for   to make me sad  no your grace  to uh teach your sister  to teach my sister how to be a better lover  you think i bought you to make khal drogo happy  oh you pretty little idiot  go on then get on with it  someday your husband will sit there  and you will sit by his side  and one day before too long you will present your son to the court  all the lords of westeros  will gather here to see the little prince  what if i have a girl  gods be good youll have boys and girls and plenty of them  what if i only have girls  i wouldnt worry about that  jeyne pooles mother had five children all of them girls  yes but its highly unlikely  but what if  well if you only had girls  i suppose the throne would pass to prince joffreys little brother  and everyone would hate me  nobody could ever hate you   joffrey does  nonsense  why would you say such a thing  that business with the wolves sansa  ive told you a hundred times   a direwolf is not  please shut up about it  do you remember your lessons  who built the iron throne  aegon the conqueror  and who built the red keep  maegor the cruel  and how many years did it take to build  my grandfather and uncle were murdered here werent they  they were killed on the orders of king aerys yes   the mad king  commonly known as the mad king  why were they killed  you should be speak to your father about these matters  i dont want to speak to my father ever  sansa you will find it in your heart  to forgive your father  no i wont  its the hands tournament thats causing   all this trouble my lords  the kings tournament  i assure you the hand wants no part of it  call it what you will lord stark ser  the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day  last night we had a tavern riot a brothel fire  three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the street of sisters   dreadful  if you cant keep the kings peace  perhaps the city watch should be commanded by someone who can   i need more men  ned youll get 50   lord baelish will see it paid for  i will  you found money for a champions purse  you can find money to keep the peace  ill also give you  till the crowds have left  thank you my lord hand ser  they will be put to good use  the sooner this is over the better  the realm prospers from such events my lord  they give the great a chance at glory  and the lowly a respite from their woes  and every inn in the city is full  and the whores are walking bowlegged  im sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket   hmmm  now  if theres nothing else my lords  oh this heat  on days like this i envy you northerners  your summer snows  until tomorrow my lord  ive been hoping to talk to you about jon arryn  lord arryn  oh his death was  a great sadness to all of us  i took personal charge of his care  but i could not save him  his sickness struck him  very hard and very fast  i saw him in my chambers  just the night before he passed  lord jon often came to me for counsel  why  i have been grand maester for many years  kings and hands have come to me for advice since  what did jon want the night before he died  oh he came inquiring after a book  a book  what book  oh i fear  it would be of little interest to you my lord  a ponderous tome  no id like to read it  the lineages and histories  of the great h of the seven kingdoms  with descriptions of many high lords  and noble ladies  and their children  harkon umber first of his name  born to lord hother umber and lady amaryllis umber  in the 183rd year after aegons landing  at the last hearth blue of eye brown of hair  and fair complected died in his 14th year  of a wound sustained in a bear hunt  as i said my lord a ponderous read  did jon arryn tell you what he wanted with it  he did not my lord and i did not presume to ask   jons death  such a tragedy  did he say anything to you during his final hours  nothing of import my lord  oh there was one phrase  he kept repeating  the seed is strong i think it was   the seed is strong  mm   what does that mean  oh  the dying mind is a demented mind lord stark  for all the weight theyre given  last words are usually  as significant as first words  and youre quite certain he died of a natural illness  what else could it be  poison  a disturbing thought  no no no i dont think it likely  the hand was loved by all  what sort of man would dare  ive heard it said that poison is a womans weapon  yes women  cravens  and eunuchs  did you know that lord varys is a eunuch  everybody knows that  yes yes of course  how that sort of person found himself  on the kings council i will never know  ive taken enough of your time  no trouble at all my lord its a great honor  thank you  ill find my own way out  syrio says a water dancer  can stand on one toe for hours  its a hard fall down these steps  syrio says every hurt is a lesson  and every lesson makes you better   tomorrow im going to be chasing cats  cats  syrio says  he says every swordsman should study cats  theyre quiet as shadows and as light as feathers  you have to be quick to catch them  hes right about that  now that brans awake  will he come live with us  well he needs to get his strength back first  he wants to be a knight of the kingsguard   he cant be one now can he  no  but someday  he could be lord of a holdfast  or sit on the kings council  or he might raise castles  like brandon the builder  can i be lord of a holdfast  you will marry a high lord  and rule his castle  and your sons shall be knights  and princes and lords  hmm no  thats not me  hello  ser alliser said im to be your new watch partner  i should warn you  i dont see all that well  come stand by the fire   its warmer  no thats all right im fine  youre not youre freezing  i dont like high places  you cant fight  you cant see  youre afraid of heights and almost everything else probably  what are you doing here sam  on the morning of my 18th nameday my father came to me  youre almost a man now he said  but youre not worthy of my land and title  tomorrow youre going to take the black  forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north  if you do not he said  then well have a hunt  and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble  and youll be thrown from your saddle to die  or so ill tell your mother  nothing would please me more  ser allisers going to make me fight again tomorrow isnt he  yes he is  im not going to get any better you know  well  you cant get any worse  i hear youre reading a boring book  hmph  pycelle talks too much  oh he never stops  do you know ser hugh of the vale  not surprising until recently  he was only a squire jon arryns squire  he was knighted almost immediately  after his masters untimely death  knighted for what  why are you telling me this  i promised cat that id help you  where is ser hugh   ill speak to him  a singularly bad idea  do you see that boy there  one of varyss little birds  the spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings  now look there  that one belongs to the queen  and do you see that septa pretending to read her book  varys or the queen  no shes one of mine  is there someone in your service whom you trust completely   yes  the wiser answer was no my lord  get a message to this paragon of yours  discreetly send him to question ser hugh  after that you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city  he lives in a large house at the top of the street of steel   why  i have my observers as i said  and its possible that they saw lord arryn  visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death  lord baelish perhaps i was wrong to distrust you  distrusting me was the wisest thing  youve done since you climbed off your horse  two three   six 27   28 29  ser hugh    ser hugh  as you can see im busy  im here on behalf of lord eddard stark  the hand of the king  im the captain of his guard  im sorry i didnt catch your name ser  no ser im not a knight  i see well it just so happens that i am  he said hed be glad to talk to the hand himself  hes a knight you see  ah a knight  they strut around like roosters down here  even the ones whove never seen an arrow coming their way  you shouldnt be out here my lord   theres no telling who has eyes where  let them look  the former hand did call on me my lord several times  i regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage  what did lord arryn want  he always came to see the boy  id like to see him as well  as you gendry my lord  here he is  strong for his age he works hard  show the hand the helmet you made lad   this is fine work  its not for sale  boy this is the kings hand   if his lordship wants the helm  i made it for me   forgive him my lord  theres nothing to forgive  when lord arryn came to visit you what would you talk about  he just asked me questions is all my lord  what kind of questions  about my work at first  if i was being treated well if i liked it here  but then he started asking me about my mother   your mother  who she was what she looked like  what did you tell him  she died when i was little  she had yellow hair  shed sing to me sometimes  look at me  get back to work lad  if the day ever comes when that boy  would rather wield a sword than forge one  you send him to me  find anything  king roberts bastard son  he likes that  this is for the king from lord stark  should i leave it with  shhh  listen  do you hear them  how many do you think are in there with him  huh   guess  three  four  he likes to do this when im on duty  he makes me listen as he insults my sister  forgive me my lord  why do i have to forgive you have you wronged me  weve met before you know  have we strange ive forgotten  the siege of pyke we fought side by side one afternoon  ah   thats where you got your scar  aye  oh  one of the greyjoys nearly took my eye   vicious sons of whores  they like their bloodshed  they stopped liking it at the end  that was a proper battle do you remember  thoros of myr charging through the breach  with his burning sword  ill remember that till the day i die  i saw the youngest of the greyjoy lads at winterfell  it was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop  theon hes a good lad  i doubt it  ill bet you smell of blackberry jam  let me smell it come here  can i leave this with you  the message from lord stark  i dont serve lord stark   where have you been  watch duty   with sam  ah prince porkchop   where is he  he wasnt hungry  impossible  thats enough  sams no different from the rest of us  there was no place for him in the world  so hes come here  were not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore  never again no matter what thorne says  hes our brother now and were going to protect him  you are in love lord snow  you girls can do as you please  but if thorne puts me up against lady piggy  im gonna slice me off a side of bacon  no one touches sam  what are you waiting for  attack him  you get in there  hit me  go on hit me  i yield  yield yield  i yield  you think this is funny do you  when youre out there  beyond the wall with the sun going down  do you want a man at your back  or a sniveling boy  you send this whore to give me commands  i should have sent you back her head  forgive me khaleesi i did as you asked  hush now its all right   irri take her and leave us  yes khaleesi   why did you hit her  how many times do i have to tell you  you do not command me  i wasnt commanding you  i just wanted to invite you to supper   whats this  its a gift   i had it made for you  dothraki rags   are you going to dress me now  please  this stinks of manure all of it  stop stop it  you would turn me into one of them wouldnt you  next youll want to braid my hair  youve no right to a braid  youve won no victories yet  you do not talk back to me  you are a horselords slut  and now youve woken the dragon  i am a khaleesi of the dothraki  i am the wife of the great khal  and i carry his son inside me  the next time you raise a hand to me  will be the last time you have hands  i know for a fact that some of the officers  go to that brothel in moles town  i wouldnt doubt it  dont you think its a little bit unfair  making us take our vows while they sneak off  for a little sally on the side   sally on the side  its silly isnt it  what we cant defend the wall unless were celibate  its absurd  i didnt think youd be so upset about it  why not   because im fat  no  but i like girls just as much as you do  they might not like me as much  ive never been with one  youve probably had hundreds  no  as a matter of fact  im the same as you  yeah  i find that hard to believe  i came very close once  i was alone in a room with a naked girl but  you didnt know where to put it  i know where to put it  was she  old and ugly  young and gorgeous  a whore named ros  what color hair   red  oh i like red hair  and her um  her   you dont want to know  that good   better  oh no  so why exactly  did you not make love to ros with the perfect  whats my name  jon snow  and why is my surname snow  because  youre a bastard from the north  i never met my mother  my father wouldnt even tell me her name  i dont know if shes living or dead  i dont know if shes a noblewoman  or a fishermans wife  or a whore  so i sat there  in the brothel as ros took off her clothes  but i couldnt do it  because all i could think was  what if i got her pregnant  and she had a child  another bastard named snow  its not a good life for a child  ah mmm  so  you didnt know where to put it  enjoying yourselves  you look cold boys  it is a bit nippy  a bit nippy yeah by the fire  indoors its still summer  do you boys even remember the last winter  how long has it been now what 10 years  i remember  was it uncomfortable at winterfell  were there days when you just couldnt get warm  never mind how many fires your servants built   i build my own fires  thats admirable  i spent six months out there beyond the wall  during the last winter  it was supposed to be a twoweek mission  we heard a rumor mance rayder was planning to attack eastwatch  so we went out to look for some of his men  capture them gather some knowledge  the wildlings who fight for mance rayder are hard men  harder than youll ever be  they know their country better than we do  they knew there was a storm coming in  so they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass  and we got caught in the open  wind so strong  it yanked 100foot trees straight from the ground  roots and all if you took your gloves off  to find your cock to have a piss  you lost a finger to the frost  and all in darkness  you dont know cold  neither of you do  the horses died first  we didnt have enough to feed them to keep them warm  eating the horses was easy  but later when we started to fall  that wasnt easy  we should have had a couple of boys like you along shouldnt we  soft fat boys like you  wed have lasted a fortnight on you  and still had bones leftover for soup  soon well have new recruits  and you lot will be passed along to the lord commander  for assignment  and they will call you men of the nights watch  but youd be fools to believe it  youre boys still  and come the winter you will die  like flies  i hit him  i hit the dragon  your brother rhaegar was the last dragon  viserys is less than the shadow of a snake  he is still the true king  the truth now  do you want to see your brother sitting on the iron throne  no  but the common people are waiting for him  illyrio said they are sewing dragon banners and praying for his return  the common people pray for rain health and a summer that never ends  they dont care what games the high lords play  what do you pray for ser jorah  home  i pray for home too  my brother will never take back the seven kingdoms  he couldnt lead an army even if my husband gave him one  hell never take us home  lovers quarrel  im sorry do i  sansa dear this is lord baelish hes known  an old friend of the family  ive known your mother a long long time   why do they call you littlefinger  arya   dont be rude  no its quite all right  when i was a child i was very small  and i come from a little spit of land called the fingers  so you see  its an exceedingly clever nickname  ive been sitting here for days  start the damn joust  before i piss myself  gods who is that  ser gregor clegane  they call him the mountain  the hounds older brother   and his opponent  littlefinger ser hugh of the vale  he was jon arryns squire  lo how far hes come  yes yes enough of the bloody pomp  have at it  not what you were expecting  has anyone ever told you the story of the mountain and the hound  lovely little tale of brotherly love  the hound was just a pup  six years old maybe  gregor a few years older  already a big lad already getting a bit of a reputation  some lucky boys  just born with a talent for violence  one evening gregor found his little brother  playing with a toy by the fire  gregors toy  a wooden knight  gregor never said a word  he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck  and shoved his face into the burning coals  held him there  while the boy screamed  while his face melted  there arent very many people who know that story  i wont tell anyone i promise  no please dont  if the hound so much as heard you mention it  im afraid all the knights in kings landing  would not be able to save you  my lord her grace the queen   your grace  youre missing your tournament  putting my name on it doesnt make it mine  i thought we might put what happened on the kingsroad behind us  the ugliness with the wolves  and forcing you to kill the beast was extreme  though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned  how is sansa  she likes it here  shes the only stark who does  favors her mother  not much of the north in her   what are you doing here  i might ask the same of you  what is it you hope to accomplish  the king called on me to serve him and the realm  and thats what ill do until he tells me otherwise  you cant change him you cant help him  hell do what he wants which is all hes ever done  youll try your best to pick up the pieces  if thats my job then so be it  youre just a soldier arent you  you take your orders and you carry on  i suppose it makes sense  your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow  i was also trained to kill my enemies your grace  as was i  seven blessings to you goodfolk  and to you  boy bread meat and beer quickly  ah good idea grandfather im starving  a song while we wait or  id rather throw myself down a well  now now grandfather this may be your last chance if youre heading north  the only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves  gods  im sorry my lord were full up   every room  tyrion my men can sleep in the stable  as for myself i dont require a large room  truly my lord we have nothing  is there nothing i can do  to remedy this  you can have my room  now theres a clever man  you can manage food i trust yoren dine with me   aye my lord  my lord of lannister  might i entertain you while you eat  i can sing of your fathers victory at kings landing  nothing would more likely ruin my supper  lady stark  what an unexpected pleasure  i was sorry to have missed you at winterfell  lady stark  i was still catelyn tully  the last time i stayed here  you ser  is that the black bat of harrenhal i see embroidered on your coat  it is my lady  and is lady whent a true and honest friend  to my father lord hoster tully of riverrun  she is  the red stallion was always a welcome sight at riverrun  my father counts jonas bracken  amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen  our lord is honored by his trust  i envy your father  all his fine friends lady stark  but i dont quite see the purpose of this  i know your sigil as well  the twin towers of frey  how fares your lord ser  lord walder is well my lady  he has asked your father for the honor of his presence  on his 90th nameday  he plans to take another wife  this man  came into my house as a guest  and there conspired to murder my son  a boy of 10  in the name of king robert and the good lords you serve  i call upon you to seize him  and help me return him to winterfell  to await the kings justice
