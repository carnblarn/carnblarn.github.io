theon greyjoy  yes  and why should i believe that  i was born on pyke to balon greyjoy  his third and last living son  i am your prince  i swear it by the drowned god  what is dead may never die  men what is dead may never die  and if you were my prince  why are you marching with a bolton army  lord bolton took me captive after winterfell  he sent me to treat with you in good faith  as your fellow ironborn  and what does lord bolton want  you are fading from sickness  you are badly outnumbered  and youre hundreds of miles from the sea  lord bolton implores you to protect your men  and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold  do this and he will be just and fair with you  as he has been with me  the boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore  he wants us to surrender  my own father your king  surrendered years ago to robert baratheon  i watched him bend the knee  there was no shame there  he fought with honor as did you  groans  mutters no shame fought with honor  im sorry i didnt hear  no shame fought with honor  only a whipped dog would speak this way  or a woman  are you a woman boy  you dont know  the ironborn will not surrender  mumbling reek my name is reek  you go tell your master that  theon greyjoy  or whoever the fuck you are  quietly my name is reek  what in the hell are you muttering  im reek  reek  if we yield we live  is that what it says on this paper here  yes have your men raise the white flag and open the gates  youre going home  ramsay  you didnt really think id let them go did you  its fallen out of fashion flaying  sad but true  traditions are important  where are we without our history   eh  yes my lord  will we go home now  i believe we will  to our new home  royce you have foreign blood dont you baelish  a greatgrandfather from braavos yes  i suppose all of our ancestors  came from somewhere else originally  royce  our forebearers settled the vale  thousands of years ago  weve fought off invaders ever since  the beauty of the vale is matched only  by the nobility of its great families  lady arryn often told me  that you were her rock lord royce  she told me nothing about you baelish  but i didnt need to hear from her  moneylender whoremonger  youve been licking tywin lannisters boots so long   its a wonder your tongues not black  my lord  and when jon arryn named you master of coin no one cared  always been a grubby job  why not let a grubby man do it  but when i heard you were lurking here  fawning over the lady arryn  lady arryn invited me  she and i have been close since childhood  yes we all know how close you were  lady arryns predilections were her own affair  her death is our affair  of course her suicide shattered us all  she was an odd fish  everyone knew that but suicide  she adored that boy of hers  i dont see her abandoning him not by choice  royce strange that within days of your arrival  youve married lady arryn and shes fallen through the moon door  she was always prone to melancholy  my lady wasnt meant for a world as brutal as ours  we were told there was a witness a girl  a niece of yours i believe  a girl with no learning and scattered wits  i assure you she would be of no help  wed like to speak with her   let me fetch her  anya no need  we prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated  door closes  come closer child  you have nothing to fear from us or him  lord baelish here is your uncle  your name is alayne  perhaps you would feel more comfortable if lord baelish left the room   my lady  i wasnt asking you   he can stay  speak up girl youre not a damn kitchen mouse  tell us what you saw  im sorry lord baelish  i have to tell the truth  ill tell you everything  please alayne leave nothing out  my name is not alayne  its sansa stark  eldest daughter of lord eddard stark  lord royce we met when you came to winterfell  you were escorting your son ser waymar to the wall  sansa stark  you tell lies right to my face you little worm  lord baelish has told many lies  all to protect me  since my father was executed  i have been a hostage in kings landing  a plaything for joffrey to torture  or queen cersei to torment  they beat me they humiliated me  they married me to the imp  i had no friends in kings landing  except one  he saved me  smuggled me away when he had the chance  he knew id be safe here in the eyrie  with my own blood my aunt lysa  the lannisters have friends everywhere  even the vale  he made me swear not to tell anyone my true name  your secret is safe with us my lady  royce your father grew up right here in these halls  we hunted together many times  he was a fine man  tell us what happened to your aunt sansa  you knew her well my lords my lady  you knew she was a troubled woman  she always loved lord baelish  she told me herself  from the moment he arrived at the gates of riverrun  a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack  she confessed to me she never loved lord arryn  she did as her father commanded as so many of us have  when the gods finally allowed her to be with lord baelish  she was so happy  for a time  my aunt was a jealous lady  she was terrified that lord baelish  didnt love her anymore  that he would abandon her for a younger woman  and then  one day she saw him kiss me  lady sansa  it was a peck on the cheek lord royce nothing more  lord baelish is my uncle now in truth by marriage  hes always been so kind to me  i was so happy to be here to be free  all because of him  but my aunt turned on me  she cursed me called me a whore  promised to throw me through the moon door  when lord baelish tried to calm her  she struck him  she said she didnt want to live anymore  she stood on the edge of that moon door  he tried to reason with her  promised her she was the only one he had ever loved  but she stepped through those doors and she was  shh  shh its not your fault sweet girl  its not your fault  you could see it in the way she raised that boy  feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old  lord royce this is hardly the time  apologies my lady  and to you as well baelish  we treated you a bit harshly  you want justice lord royce  i can hardly complain about that  i want the same  not much justice to be meted out in suicide is there  for lysa no but for her son  only 20 years ago the knights of the vale  rode behind jon arryn ned stark robert baratheon  they fought together to overcome the mad king  and since then arryn and royce  corbray waynwood  all the great houses of the vale watched from the corner  a timid boy at a tavern brawl  are you questioning our courage  i want to know which side youre on  do you support the lannisters  the house that executed your friend ned stark  of course we dont support the damn lannisters  no catelyn stark begged her sister for support and lysa refused  by staying out of the fray youve allowed tywin lannister  to destroy his rivals on every compass point  who stands against him now  who would you have us back lord baelish  robb stark is dead  id have you back robin arryn  lord of the vale  robin arryn is a sickly little boy  and sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men  more often they die young  i adored lysa with all my heart  but she loved her son so much she became overprotective  he needs to learn how to swing a sword  how to ride a horse   aye its time  yes its time  time for him to tour the vale  to visit all the castles in his domain  time for robin to leave the nest  grunts  boy ser barristan  yes  who sent you   ser barristan  ser jorah  have i forgotten a council meeting  no  whats this  a royal pardon  signed by robert baratheon  you spied on her  who gave you this  does it matter  have you told her  i wanted to tell you first mantoman  rather than go behind your back  let me speak with her in private  youll never be alone with her again  why did the usurper pardon you  if we could speak alone  no speak to me here  explain it to me  who do you think sent this to meereen  who profits  this is the work of tywin lannister  he wants to divide us  if were fighting each other were not fighting him  the pardon was signed the year we met  why were you pardoned  unless youre saying this document was forged  it is not forged  why then  i sent letters to varys  the spymaster of kings landing  what was the content of these letters   information  what information  when you and viserys arrived in pentos  his plan to marry you to khal drogo  when you were married  when your brother died  you told him i was carrying drogos child   i  yes or no   khaleesi   dont call me that  did you tell him i was carrying drogos child  yes  that wine merchant tried to poison me  because of your information  i stopped you from drinking his wine  because you knew it was poisoned  i suspected  you betrayed me  from the first  forgive me  i never meant  please khaleesi forgive me  you sold my secrets to the man who killed my father   and stole my brothers throne  i have protected you  fought for you killed for you  and you want me to forgive you  i have loved you  love  love how can you say that to me  any other man and i would have you executed  but you i do not want you in my city dead or alive  go back to your masters in kings landing  collect your pardon if you can  daenerys please  dont ever presume to touch me again  or speak my name  you have until dusk to collect your things  and leave this city  if youre found in meereen past break of day  ill have your head thrown into slavers bay  go  now  footsteps departing  moat cailin is yours father  walk with me  has there been any word from locke  no  unimportant  a cripple a young boy  none of the northern lords have seen them  dead most likely  most of the ironborn have fled the north  now more will follow thanks to you  tell me what you see  moors fields hills  tell me what you see  nothing  not nothing  the north  ride 700 miles that way youre still in the north    the north is larger than the other six kingdoms combined  and i am the warden of the north  the north is mine  now tell me what is your name  ramsay snow  no not ramsay snow  open it  from this day until your last day  you are ramsay bolton  son of roose bolton warden of the north  you honor me  i swear i will uphold your name  and your tradition  i will be worthy of you father  i promise  come reek ill be needing a bath  knocks  yes  door closes  first time i saw you you were just a child  a girl from the north come to the capital for the first time  not a child any longer  why did you help me  they would have thrown you through the moon door  if they found you guilty  thats not an answer  if theyd have executed you  what would they have done with me  i dont know  neither do i  better to gamble on the man you know  than the strangers you dont  and you think you know me  i know what you want  do you  arya i thought itd make me happy  but it doesnt not really  hound nothing makes you happy   lots of things make me happy  like what  killing polliver killing rorge  so youre sad because you didnt get to kill joffrey yourself  is that it  at least i could have been there to watch  i wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over  aye nothing in the world beats that look  you protected him for most of his life  you think you could have saved him  i wasnt the damn wine taster  little shit deserved to die but poison  poisons a womans weapon  men kill with steel  thats your stupid pride talking  its why youll never be a great killer  id have killed joffrey with a chicken bone if i had to  laughs  id pay good money to see that  groans  you should have let me burn it  its a fleabite  that fleabites got you walking a lot slower than you used to  well we wont have to walk too much further  you really think my aunt will pay for me  aye shell pay  ive never even met her  doesnt matter youre her blood  family honor all that horseshit  its all you lords and ladies ever talk about  im not a lady  knight who would pass the bloody gate  the bloody hound sandor clegane  and his  traveling companion arya stark  niece of your lady lysa arryn  then i offer my condolences  lady arryn died  three days ago  laughing  laughing continues  ive never left home before uncle petyr   im afraid to leave  you shouldnt be  the lord of the vale belongs in the eyrie mother said  she said its not safe outside  it wasnt safe for her inside  people die at their dinner tables  they die in their beds  they die squatting over their chamber pots  everybody dies sooner or later  dont worry about your death  worry about your life  take charge of your life  for as long as it lasts  that is what it means to be lord of the vale  footsteps  shall we go  wine always helps  i thank you for it  trial by combat  deciding a mans guilt or innocence  in the eyes of the gods  by having two other men hack each other to pieces  tells you something about the gods  how much longer  soon  do you think oberyn has a chance  the red viper of dorne  you dont get a name like that unless youre deadly right  ive never seen him fight  oh hes going to die im going to die  oberyn believes in himself  thats putting it mildly  whats the punishment for regicide  drawing and quartering hanging    breaking at the wheel  beheading  seems rather ordinary  and he was my nephew as well so what is that  fratricide is brothers  filicide is sons  nepoticide thats the one  matricide patricide  infanticide suicide  theres no kind of killing that doesnt have its own word  cousins  cousins youre right  there is no word for cousin killing  well done  do you remember cousin orson orson lannister  of course wetnurse dropped him on his head   left him simple   simple  used to sit all day in the garden  crushing beetles with a rock  both grunting  chuckles nothing made him happier  nothing made you happier  youd think being tormented from birth  would have given you some affinity for the afflicted  on the contrary laughing at another persons misery  was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else  the joke wore thin though  for you you drifted away  i had other interests  yes other interests  but i stayed with orson  why  i was curious  why was he smashing all those beetles  what did he get out of it  first thing i did was ask him  orson why are you smashing all those beetles  he gave me an answer smash the beetles  smash em grunting  i wasnt deterred  i was the smartest person i knew  certainly i had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries  that lay at the heart of a moron  so i went to maester volariks library  volarik tried to touch me once  turns out far too much has been written about great men  and not nearly enough about morons  doesnt seem right  in any case i found nothing  that illuminated the nature of orsons affliction  or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter  so i went back to the source  i may not have been able to speak with orson  but i could observe him watch him  the way men watch animals  to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior  and as i watched  i became more and more sure of it  there was something happening there  his face was like the page of a book  written in a language i didnt understand  but he wasnt mindless he had his reasons  and i became possessed with knowing what they were  i began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him  i would eat my lunch in the garden  chewing my mutton to the music of  grunting  and when i wasnt watching him i was thinking about him  father droned on about the family legacy  and i thought about orsons beetles  i read the histories of targaryen conquests  did i hear dragon wings no  i heard grunting  and i still couldnt figure out why he was doing it  and i had to know because it was horrible  that all these beetles should be dying for no reason  every day around the world  men women and children are murdered by the score  who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles  i know i know but still it filled me with dread  piles and piles of them years and years of them  how many countless living crawling things  smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt  in my dreams i found myself  standing on a beach made of beetle husks  stretching as far as the eye could see  i woke up crying  weeping for their shattered little bodies  i tried to stop orson once  he was twice your size  he just pushed me aside with a kuuh  and kept on smashing  every day until that mule  kicked him in the chest and killed him  so what do you think  why did he do it  what was it all about  i dont know  bells tolling  good luck today  door closes  crowd shouting  looks like very light armor  i like to move around  you could at least wear a helmet  you shouldnt drink before a fight  you learn this during your years in the fighting pits  i always drink before a fight  it could get you killed it could get me killed  today is not the day i die  crowd cheering  youre going to fight that  im going to kill that  he is the biggest man ive ever seen  size does not matter when you are flat on your back  thank the gods  horn blows  in the sight of gods and men  we gather to ascertain  the guilt or innocence of this  man tyrion lannister  may the mother grant them mercy  may the father give them such justice as they deserve  and may the warrior guide the hand    horn blows  of our champion  dont leave me alone in this world  never  crowd cheering  have they told you who i am  some dead man  i am the brother of elia martell  do you know why i have come all the way to this stinking  shitpile of a city  for you  im going to hear you confess before you die  you raped my sister  you murdered her  you killed her children  say it now and we can make this quick  shouting  say it you raped her  you murdered her  shouts  you killed her children  growls  you raped her  you murdered her  you killed her children  grunts  crowd cheering  groans  you raped her  you murdered her  screams  you killed her children  groans  crowd clamoring  wait are you dying  no no no  you cant die yet you havent confessed  say it  say her name elia martell  you raped her you killed her children  elia martell  who gave you the order  who gave you the order  say her name  you raped her you murdered her  you killed her children  say it say her name   say it

name of king tommen of the house baratheon  first of his name  you are hereby sentenced to death   music playing
