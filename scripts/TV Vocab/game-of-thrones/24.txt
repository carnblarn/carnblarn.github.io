man drink horse piss that fast  stop  far enough  do that again and ill take your other hand  come on you  oh lord tyrion come in come in  i hope we might speak  in confidence  oh always in confidence  about the events of the blackwater  perhaps this is the wrong time  oh no its a wonderful time  i thought one of your little birds  might have knowledge of my sisters intentions to  end your life  i didnt inherit littlefingers spies  along with his position im afraid  which is why im coming to you   i need proof  proof   will there be a trial  i need to know  i have no proof only whispers  before all this nastiness  i was going to tell you the story of how i was cut  do you want to hear it still  i dont know do i  as a boy i travelled with a troupe of actors  through the free cities  one day in myr  a certain man made my master an offer  too tempting to refuse  i feared the man meant to use me as id heard  some men used small boys  but what he wanted was far worse  he gave me a potion  that made me powerless to move or speak  yet did nothing to dull my senses  with a hooked blade he sliced me  root and stem chanting all the while  he burned my parts in a brazier  the flames turned blue  and i heard a voice answer his call  i still dream of that night  not of the sorcerer  not of his blade  i dream of the voice from the flames  was it a god a demon  a conjurors trick  i dont know  but the sorcerer called and a voice answered  and ever since that day  i have hated magic and all those who practice it  but you can see why i was eager to aid  in your fight against stannis and his red priestess  a symbolic revenge of sorts  yes ahem i feel the need for actual revenge  against the actual person  who tried to have me killed  which will require a degree of influence which  you do not possess  at the moment  but influence is largely  a matter of patience i have found  once i had served the sorcerers purpose  he threw me out of his house to die  i resolved to live  to spite him  i begged  i sold what parts of my body remained to me  i became an excellent thief  and soon learned that the contents of a mans letters  are more valuable than the contents of his purse  step by step  one distasteful task after another  i made my way from the slums of myr  to the small council chamber  influence grows like a weed  i tended mine patiently  until its tendrils reached from the red keep  all the way across to the far side of the world  where i managed to wrap them around something  very special  the sorcerer  hello my old friend  its been a long time  i have no doubt the revenge you want  will be yours in time  if you have the stomach for it  when people talk about the nights watch  they never mention the shoveling  or the shit  they tell you about honor pardoning crimes  and protecting the realm  but shoveling really is most of it  and getting attacked or killed or worse  and that but when youre not getting attacked or killed  usually youre shoveling  oh look  more shit  i was starting to wonder what to do  with the rest of my day  we need to get out of here  when the lord commander says we go we go  the lord commander told us to go to the fist of the first men   howd that turn out for us  he had no way of knowing  we do now  we know whats out there  crasters been out here surviving  so hes your new protector now  our good friend craster  were like the sons he never had  mormont isnt gonna save you  this lummox here isnt gonna save you  when the walkers come calling  craster will serve us up like so many pigs  if we want to live  well have to look out for ourselves  shh shh shh   you woke him  im sorry   hes beautiful  shh  hes beautiful  does he have a name   no  are you going to give him one  why  here   gilly  you said to hold it for you until you came back   youre back  i wanted you to have it  i dont want your stupid thimble  i want to save my babys life can you do that  can you  i dont have time for you  i dont have time for anyone but him  because he doesnt have much time  you have to go after him  how  you know how  brandon   mother  how many times have i told you   no climbing  mother i need to find it   its here its calling me  i want you to promise me  no more climbing promise me  promise me promise me   mother mother  promise me promise me bran  promise me  is he very large  no larger than usual apparently   and yet they said that he was  extraordinary  the most extraordinary man theyve ever had  and theyve had a lot of men  were talking about the same podrick  the quiet boy in lord tyrions service  seems a bit simple  what did he do to them  i dont know my lord  the girls are usually quite descriptive  so what did they say  they said it was hard to describe  huh  prodigies appear in the oddest of places  and what did littlefinger say about this loss of income  he was too preoccupied to notice  hes leaving for the eyrie soon  im helping him prepare for his journey  ah yes to pursue his enduring love  of the lady arryn and the title that comes with her  sad really  is that all it takes  to make our friend lose interest in poor sansa stark  he hasnt spoken to her since the last time  as far as i know  but i dont think hes lost interest  what makes you say so   his shipboard inventory  ah  you can read  rare for a woman in your profession   former profession  of course  im missing something obvious youre about to point out  two featherbeds  hes bringing two featherbeds for the cabin  who is important enough to littlefinger  to merit a featherbed besides littlefinger  could he be bringing one of his girls  hes not interested in them my lord  how do you know  because im one of his girls  prodigies in odd places indeed  rhaenyra targaryen was murdered by her brother  or rather his dragon  it ate her while her son watched  whats left of her is buried in the crypts right down there  the ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum  which seats 700 comfortably  there appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere  on the premises for everyone else  there arent more than 700 people of any importance  no the rest are there to look adoringly  upon the 700 to remind them  how superior they must be to have the best seats  over there in that urn  the ashes of aerion targaryen  aerion brightflame they called him  he thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon  he was wrong  and of course theres the mad king  killed by my uncle  would you like to see where the last targaryens are buried  are you sure lady margaery doesnt find all this a bit macabre  oh no its quite all right your grace  id love to see their tombs really  its like taking a walk through history   the tombs just up here  this is so exciting  you were married here your grace   yes  must seem like only yesterday  seems like a lifetime ago  your husband was he buried here as well  no he wanted his remains returned to storms end   such a tragedy  a fairly predictable tragedy  hunting and drinking dont mix  i should say not  my sons a hunter it helps him forget  hes never been within a mile of a real battle  i seem to recall he laid siege to storms end  for the better part of a year  all he laid siege to  was the banquet table in the command tent  i told him to stay out of roberts rebellion  he had no business fighting an actual warrior  we mothers do what we can  to keep our sons from the grave  but they do seem to yearn for it  we shower them with good sense  and it slides right off like rain off a wing  and yet the world belongs to them  a ridiculous arrangement to my mind  the gods have seen fit to make it so  my father didnt want them here  he was going to have their bodies burned  and thrown in the blackwater  but the high septon convinced him otherwise  im glad he did  im sorry your grace  i know they did terrible things at the end  but their ancestors built this  sometimes severity  is the price we pay for greatness  i couldnt agree more  shall we go and see them  if you give them your love  they will return it a thousandfold  ive spoken with them  i know how they feel about you  you led the defense of kings landing  they adore you  open the doors  joffrey  wait   lady margaery  lady margaery  bless you lady margaery   lady margaery  lady margaery   margaery  long live lady margaery  king joffrey  king joffrey king joffrey  king joffrey  gods bless king joffrey  how far is it to deepwood motte  not far my lord  your sister is waiting for you there   she sent you to save me  yes  i served them the men who were torturing you  i did what they told me and waited for the right moment  why would you risk your life for me  i grew up on saltcliffe my lord  i was only a boy when they took you away  my father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs  so we could watch the ship that carried you off  i remember the look on my fathers face when he told us  thats balon greyjoys last living son  and those are the words i heard over and over again  when i saw what they were doing to you  those men  they said my father knew what they were doing to me  did he  i i dont know my lord  they they never told me much  my sisters men are loyal to her  we dont need to hide from them  not all those are your sisters men  some of them are loyal to your father  what is it  i was just thinking how jealous i was  when my father told yara to take this place  what did he tell you to do  raid fishing villages  he didnt trust me  thought i was a stark  ha i could never be a stark  robb stark always reminded me of that   he lorded it over you  didnt have to  all he had to do was be  be who he was born to be  his life fit him better than his clothes  how could someone like that ever be a brother to me  hes the king in the north  and me  my father gave me a choice  and i made it  i could never be a stark  but ironborn  thats what i was born to be  i paid the iron price for winterfell  i murdered those boys  the stark boys  never found them  just some poor orphans living with a farmer  i let dagmer slit their throats  and i let him burn the bodies  so i could keep winterfell  and make my father proud  maybe its not too late  it is  my real father lost his head at kings landing  i made a choice  and i chose wrong  and now ive burned everything down  not everything my lord  shes up here   yara  shh  wait  i brought him back he killed the others  what no i didnt  you cant  no please stop  no  put him back where he belongs  eat  what are you doing  im dying  you cant die  you need to live  to take revenge  i dont care about revenge  you coward  a little misfortune and youre giving up  misfor  misfortune  you lost your hand  my sword hand i was that hand  you have a taste  one taste of the real world  where people have important things taken from them  and you whine and cry and quit  you sound like a bloody woman  i know what you did for me  you told them tarth was full of sapphires  its called the sapphire isle  because of the blue of its water  you knew that  why did you help me  you wanted to speak to me  yes about jaime  what about him  i wanted to make sure  were doing everything we can to get him back  when catelyn stark took tyrion prisoner  what did i do in response   you started a war  and if i would start a war  for that lecherous little stump  what do you think i am doing for my oldest son and heir  whatever you can  whatever i can   youre still here  yes  why  did it ever occur to you  that i might be the one who deserves your confidence  and your trust not your sons  not jaime or tyrion but me  years and years of lectures on family  and legacy  the same lecture really  just with tiny tedious variations  did it ever occur to you that your daughter  might be the only one listening to them living by them  that she might have the most to contribute to your legacy  that you love so much more than your actual children  all right contribute  the tyrells are a problem  the tyrells helped us defeat stannis baratheon  the tyrells saved your life your childrens lives  margaery has her claws in joffrey  she knows how to manipulate him  good  i wish you knew how to manipulate him  i dont distrust you because youre a woman  i distrust you because youre not as smart as you think you are  youve allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you  and everyone else in this city  perhaps  you should try stopping him from doing what he likes  i will  do you like it nana  another golden rose how original  i eat from plates stamped with roses  i sleep in sheets embroidered with roses  i have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot  as if that makes it smell any better  roses are boring dear  growing strong  ha the dullest words of any house  winter is coming  now thats memorable  we do not sow strong strong  those are houses you watch out for  direwolves and krakens fierce beasts  but a golden rose growing strong  ha that strikes fear in the heart  look little loves  a spider in the garden  run along now  grow strong  my lady  i wanted to personally welcome you to kings landing  the city has been made brighter by your presence  the city is made brighter by my presence  is that your usual line lord varys  are you here to seduce me  a little obvious perhaps  oh no please  seduce away its been so long  though i rather think its all for naught  what happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit  a question for the philosophers  but youve come mincing all this way for something   so  might i sit  no  come ive heard youre such a clever man  im curious why youve sought me out  youve taken an interest in sansa stark  have i  because i spoke to her once in this garden  and one of your little spies came running to tell you  why shouldnt i take an interest   shes an interesting girl  is she  no not particularly  but shes had an interesting childhood  she has sadly  well forgive me for wasting your time then  i thought we shared certain hopes for her wellbeing  come come  you surrender rather easily  walk with me  i know the walls have ears  but apparently the shrubbery does too  i choose my allies carefully  and my enemies more carefully still  which is sansa stark  neither a babe in the woods   i admired her father  yes  ned stark had many admirers  and how many stepped forward  when the executioner came for his head  i could not help lord stark   perhaps i can help his daughter  how  youre not the only one who has taken an interest in her  thats hardly surprising  shes a beautiful girl with a famous name  indeed shed make a lovely match for the right suitor  it almost feels as if youre about to arrive at the point  littlefinger is not long for the capital  a confidant of mine has told me  that when he goes sansa stark goes with him  and why have you come to me with this matter  littlefinger was born with no lands no wealth no armies  he has acquired the first two  how long before he has the army  perhaps youll laugh  but i know him better than most  and this is the truth  littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in westeros  if robb stark falls  sansa stark is the key to the north  and if littlefinger marries her hell have the key in his pocket  which seems such a shame  why should a man with such a low reputation  steal away such a lovely bride  you must despise him  youre working so hard to undermine him  actually i rather enjoy him  but he would see this country burn  if he could be king of the ashes  you are a clever man lord varys  you are too kind  i believe i have a possible solution  one doesnt need to be clever for that  its all rather obvious isnt it  ahem  i didnt mean to disturb you  you havent  wed like some privacy please  if you wouldnt mind waiting back inside the keep  or if youd be kind enough to give me your names  ill ask the king to speak with you himself  what did you pray for   i cant tell you  why not  ill tell you what i prayed for in the sept this morning  lets see for my familys health and happiness  for an end to the war for a short winter  boring and traditional im afraid   and you  im sorry i just cant  my cousin alanna  was the most beautiful girl id ever seen  when i was 12 i was all elbows and knees  and alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me  pigface she called me  pigface thats ridiculous  i think it had something to do with my nose  whenever she passed me in the halls shed oink  so i prayed that shed catch a horrible skin disease  a week after that she came down with porridge plague   porridge plague  you dont have it in the north  your skin starts to look like boiled oats  and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony  but thats awful  youre  i believed you  porridge plague im an idiot  dont say that no youre not  so what happened to alanna  oh she grew up to be the most beautiful woman  and married a handsome lord and they have darling children  and live in a castle by the sea  its all terribly frustrating  im sure shes jealous of you now  youll be married here in the capital  and shell have to come watch and pretend to be happy that youre queen  i want us to be friends good friends  that would make me very happy  you must see highgarden  youd love it there i know you would  we have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon  you should see the costumes  people work on them for months  i i dont think the queen  would let me leave kings landing  the queen regent you mean  once i marry joffrey ill be queen  and if you were to marry loras  oh your place would be at highgarden wouldnt it  we would be sisters you and i  would you like that  his name was bannen  he was a good man  a good ranger  he came to us from  where did he come from  down white harbor way  he came to us from white harbor  never failed in his duty  he kept his vows the best he could  he rode far fought fiercely  we shall never see his like again  and now his watch has ended  and now his watch has ended  didnt think a broke foot could kill a man  it wasnt his foot that killed him  that bastard craster starved him to death  crasters got his daughters to feed  you on his side  we cant just show up and steal all his food  were brothers of the nights watch not thieves  the day we leave  craster will tap a barrel of our wine  and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes  and laugh at us  starving in the snow  hes a bloody wildling is all he is  never knew bannen could smell so good  you have one son dont you mormont  i had my 99th  you ever meet a man with 99 sons  and more daughters than i can count   im glad for you  are you now  me ill be glad when you and yours have gone  as soon as our wounded are strong enough  ah  theyre as strong as theyre gonna get  them thats dying  why dont you cut their throats and be done with it  hmm  or leave them if youve not the stomach  and ill sort them myself  whose throat you gonna cut old man  wait outside  its cold outside and theres nothing to eat  my wives gave you bread  theres sawdust in the bread  you dont like it  you go out there and eat the snow  id rather eat what youve got hidden away  i told you to wait outside  hes sitting there drinking our wine  eating his fill while we die  i gave you crows enough  ive got to feed my women  so you admit youve got a hidden larder then  how elsed you make it through winter  enough out  i am a godly man  youre a stingy bastard  bastard  out with you you little thief  and you and you  go sleep in the cold on empty bellies  ill chop the hands off the next man  who calls me bastard  you are a bastard  a daughterfucking wildling bastard  the gods will curse us for this   by all the laws  there are no laws beyond the wall  now show us where he hides the food  or youll get the same as he did

some of us were swineherds  and some of us tanners and masons  that was before  youre still swineherds  and tanners and masons  you think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier  no  fighting in a war makes you a soldier  beric dondarrion  youve seen better days  and i wont see them again  stark deserters  baratheon deserters  you lot arent fighting in a war  youre running from it  last i heard you were king joffreys guard dog  but here you are  which of us is running  untie these ropes and well find out  what are you doing leading a mob of peasants  ned stark ordered me to execute your brother  in king roberts name  ned stark is dead  king robert is dead  my brothers alive  youre fighting for ghosts  thats what we are  ghosts waiting for you in the dark  you cant see us  but we see you  no matter whose cloak you wear  lannister stark baratheon  you prey on the weak  the brotherhood without banners will hunt you down  you found god is that it  aye ive been reborn  in the light of the one true god  as have we all  as would any man whos seen the things weve seen  if you mean to murder me then bloody well get on with it  youll die soon enough dog  but it wont be murder only justice  and a kinder fate than you deserve  lions you call yourselves  at the mummers ford girls of seven years were raped  and babes still on the breast  were cut in two while their mothers watched  i wasnt at the mummers ford  dump your dead children at some other door  house clegane was built upon dead children  i saw them lay prince aegon and princess rhaenys  before the iron throne  do you take me for my brother  is being born clegane a crime   murder is a crime  i never touched the targaryen babes  i never saw them never smelled them  never heard them bawling  you want to cut my throat get on with it  but dont call me murderer  and pretend that youre not  you murdered mycah  the butchers boy  my friend  he was 12 years old he was unarmed  and you rode him down  you slung him over your horse like he was some deer  aye he was a bleeder  you dont deny killing this boy  i was joffreys sworn shield   the boy attacked the prince  thats a lie  i hit joffrey mycah just ran away  then i should have killed you  not my place to question princes  you stand accused of murder  but no one here knows the truth of the charge  so it is not for us to judge you  only the lord of light may do that now  i sentence you to trial by combat  so who will it be  should we find out if your fire god  really loves you priest  or you archer what are you worth with a sword in your hand  or is the little girl the bravest one here  aye  she might be  but its me youll fight  the master says they are untested  he says you would be wise to blood them early  there are many small cities between here and there  cities ripe for sacking  should you take captives  the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price  and who knows  in 10 years some of the boys you send them  may be unsullied in their turn  thus all shall prosper  is it done then they belong to me  it is done  _  you hold the whip  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  dracarys
