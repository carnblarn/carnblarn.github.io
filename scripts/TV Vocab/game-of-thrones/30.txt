list of people you mean to kill  for laughing at me  do i look like joffrey to you  no death seems a bit extreme  fear of death on the other hand  you should learn to ignore them  my lady people have been laughing at me  far longer than theyve been laughing at you  im the halfman  the demon monkey the imp  youre a lannister  i am the disgraced daughter of the traitor ned stark  the disgraced daughter and the demon monkey  were perfect for each other  so how should we punish them  who whom  ser eldrick sarsfield and lord desmond crakehall  ah  i could speak to lord varys and learn their perversions  anyone named desmond crakehall must be a pervert  i hear that youre a pervert  i am the imp  i have certain standards to maintain  we could sheep shift lord desmonds bed  you cut a little hole in his mattress  and you stuff sheep dung inside  then you sew up the hole and make his bed again  his room will stink but he wont know where its coming from  lady sansa  my sister used to do that when she was angry with me  and she was always angry with me  why sheep shift  thats the vulgar word for dung  my lady  well you asked me  oh  thats him  my lord my lady  your father has called a meeting of the small council  killed a few puppies today  show him  come on show him  oh apologies my lord  old fingers  roslin caught a fine fat trout  her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding  signed walder frey  is that bad poetry  or is it supposed to mean something  robb stark is dead  and his bitch mother  write back to lord frey  thank him for his service and command him  to send robb starks head  im going to serve it to sansa at my wedding feast  your grace lady sansa is your aunt by marriage  a joke joffrey did not mean it  yes i did  im going to have it served to sansa at my wedding feast  no  she is no longer yours to torment  everyone is mine to torment  youd do well to remember that you little monster  oh im a monster  perhaps you should speak to me more softly then  monsters are dangerous  and just now kings are dying like flies  i could have your tongue out  for saying that  let him make his threats  hmm hes a bitter little man  lord tyrion should apologize immediately  unacceptable disrespectful  and in very bad taste  i am the king  i will punish you  any man who must say i am the king  is no true king  ill make sure you understand that  when ive won your war for you  my father won the real war  he killed prince rhaegar he took the crown  while you hid under casterly rock  the king is tired  see him to his chambers   come along  im not tired  we have so much to celebrate  a wedding to plan you must rest  grand maester perhaps some essence of nightshade  to help him sleep  im not tired  come  not you  you just sent the most powerful man in westeros  to bed without his supper  youre a fool if you believe hes the most powerful man in westeros  a treasonous statement joffrey is king  you really think a crown gives you power  no  i think armies give you power   mmhmm  robb stark had one  never lost a battle  and you defeated him all the same   mmhmm  oh i know  walder frey gets all the credit  or the blame i suppose  depending on your allegiance  walder frey is many things  but a brave man  no  he never would have risked such an action  if he didnt have certain assurances  which he got from me  do you disapprove  im all for cheating this is war  but to slaughter them at a wedding  explain to me why it is more noble  to kill 10000 men in battle  than a dozen at dinner  so thats why you did it  to save lives  to end the war to protect the family  do you want to write a song for the dead starks  go ahead write one  im in this world a little while longer  to defend the lannisters to defend my blood  the northerners will never forget  good  let them remember what happens  when they march on the south  all the stark men are dead  winterfell is a ruin  roose bolton will be named warden of the north  until your son by sansa comes of age  i believe you still have some work to do on that score  do you think shell open her legs for me  after i tell her how we murdered her mother and brother  one way or another you will get that girl pregnant  i will not rape her  shall i explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works  use small words im not as bright as you  the house that puts family first will always defeat  the house that puts the whims and wishes  of its sons and daughters first  a good man does everything in his power  to better his familys position  regardless of his own selfish desires  does that amuse you  no its a very good lesson  only its easy for you to preach utter devotion to family  when youre making all the decisions  easy for me is it  when have you ever done something that wasnt in your interest  but solely for the benefit of the family  the day that you were born  i wanted to carry you into the sea  and let the waves wash you away  instead i let you live  and i brought you as my son  because youre a lannister  sansa  its empty  lets find a place to sleep  hodor  hodor  dont hodor  maybe we shouldnt stay  youd rather be out there  there are a lot of stories about this place  horrible stories  i always quite liked the horrible stories  so did i  once  you ever heard about the rat cook  no whos he  just a cook in the nights watch  he was angry at the king for something  i dont remember  when the king was visiting the nightfort  the cook killed the kings son  cooked him into a big pie  with onions carrots mushrooms and bacon  that night he served the pie to the king  he liked the taste of his son so much  he asked for a second slice  the gods turned the cook into a giant white rat  who could only eat his own young  hes been roaming the nightfort ever since  devouring his own babies  but no matter what he does  hes always hungry  if the gods turned every killer  into a giant white rat  it wasnt for murder the gods cursed the rat cook  or for serving the kings son in a pie  he killed a guest beneath his roof  thats something the gods cant forgive  the late walder frey old tully called me  because i didnt get my men to the trident in time for battle  he thought he was witty  look at us now tully  youre dead your daughters dead  your grandsons dead  your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon  and im lord of riverrun  the blackfish escaped  an old man on the run  with no allies  i have tywin lannister backing me   who does he have  as you say  they all laughed at me  all those high lords  they all thought they were better than me  ned stark hoster tully  people snigger when i marry a young girl  but who said a word when jon arryn married the little tully bitch  youll be needing a new young girl  yeah  got that to look forward to  and you  the warden of the north  no more starks to bow and scrape to  must have been torture  following that stupid boy all over the country  he ignored my advice at every turn  if hed been a trifle less arrogant  calling himself the young wolf  hows that for pomposity  well heres to the young wolf  forever young  will you move to winterfell now that the wars over  at some point perhaps  but winterfells in ruins  yeah  what happened up there  i heard the greyjoy boy seized the place  i heard he killed all the ravens  and after that nothing  i sent my bastard ramsay to root him out  robb stark offered amnesty for the ironborn  if they gave us theon  oh and  ramsay delivered the terms  the ironborn turned on theon as we knew they would  they handed him over trussed and hooded  but ramsay well  ramsay has his own way of doing things  well the girls werent lying  you had a goodsized cock  what  no  pork sausage  you think im some sort of savage  people talk about phantom limbs  an amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be  so ive always wondered  do eunuchs have a phantom cock  next time you think about naked girls  would you feel an itch  sorry  i shouldnt make jokes  my mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples  but my father taught me to aim for their head  kill me  sorry what  kill me  a little louder  kill me  youre no good to me dead  we need you  you dont look like a theon greyjoy anymore  thats a name for a lord  but youre not a lord  are you  youre just meat  stinking meat  you reek  reek  thats a good name for you  whats your name  theon greyjoy  whats your name  th  theon greyjoy  please  what is your name  reek  my name is  reek  hodor   dont kill me  who are you   sam sam  who are you  gilly dont hurt us  where are

ive been around ghost enough to know a direwolf when i see one  and ive heard all about hodor  hodor  id be dead if it wasnt for jon  if youre his brother youre my brother too  and anything i can do to help you i will  take us north of the wall  what  why in the world would you want to go  i dont want to i have to  how did you get through the wall  does the well lead to an underground river is

death  if jon is alive  then castle blacks where hell be  its the safest place for you  theres nowhere safe any longer you know that  what i know is what i saw  and if you saw it too youd run the other way  you saw the white walkers and the army of the dead  how do you know all that  the nights watch cant stop them  the kings of westeros and all their armies cant stop them  but youre going to stop them  please sam  i have to go north  i have to  balon greyjoy lord of the iron islands  and invader of the north  i give you until the full moon  to order all ironborn scum out of the north  and back to those shitstained rocks  you call a home  on the first night of the full moon  i will hunt down every islander  still in our lands and flay them living  the way i flayed the 20 ironborn scum  i found at winterfell  in the box youll find a special gift  theons favorite toy  he cried when i took it away from him  leave the north now or more boxes will follow  with more theon  signed ramsay snow  naturalborn son of roose bolton  lord of the dreadfort and warden of the north  get that out of my sight  theon disobeyed my orders  the boy is a fool  he cannot further the greyjoy line  i will not give up the lands i have seized  the strongholds i have taken  get this away from me  hes your son  son  hes not a man anymore  hes your son  hes my brother  hes a greyjoy  watch yourself  ive made my decision  and ive made mine  im going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet  im going to choose the 50 best killers on the iron islands  get those ropes  im going to sail up the narrow sea  all the way to the weeping water  im going to march on the dreadfort  im going to find my little brother  and im going to bring him home  what is it  dragonglass  we found them at the fist  someone buried them a long time ago  someone wanted us to find them  why what are they for  killing white walkers  how do you know that  the walker came for my baby  and sam  but no ones killed a white walker in thousands of years  well i suppose someone had to be the first  take it hodor  and the archer  i got lucky  with one of them  there are more  many more  and for every one of them  the dead men  more than you could count  i wish youd come with us  i wish i could  i really do  how are you keeping  great  never better  it was just a bit of blood  i should have known  every time a highborn asks my name its trouble  were not really people to you are we  just a million different ways to get what you want   im not a highborn  she called you ser  i heard it  a recent state of affairs  i was born in flea bottom just like you  sure you were  youre my friend youre here to help  i lived below the street of flour  how far below  how close to the red keep were you  the shit that poured from their privy pipes  flowed down the side of aegons hill  along tanners row and right in front of my front door   on gin alley  gin alley  the street of steel  with your armor and your knights pfft  you lived in the fancy part of town  and here we are now  two boys from flea bottom in the castle of a king  yeah weve come a long way  were all the same really  she went to great pains to point that out to me  if you mistrust fancy people so much  why were you in such a hurry to trust her  youre me  never been with a woman  never talked to a woman really  and then she comes at you  big words no clothes  what would you have done  she does know her way around a mans head ill give her that  so howd you become a lord  oh thats a long story  better not then im a bit busy  many years ago i helped king stannis  out of a difficult situation  he rewarded me with a lordship  and this  you see  highborns  i didnt want to be a lord  i nearly didnt accept  why did you  i did it for my son  i didnt want him to step over a river of shit  every time he stepped through his front door  i wanted him to have a better life  does he  hes dead  howd he die  following me  when did you come to this strange country  when i was 13  you were only a child  i stopped being a child when i was nine  my mother made sure of that  youve been a good influence  on our mutual friend you know  he used to drink from sundown to sunup  visit three brothels a night  gamble away his fathers money  now its just the drinking  and now im his wifes servant  i brush her hair and clip her nails  and empty her chamber pot  she is a sweet young thing  none of this is her fault  i love that girl i would kill for her  do you think that makes it easier for me  no i expect not  shes young and shes beautiful and highborn  we break bread with them  but that doesnt make us family  weve learned their language  but well never be their countrymen  if you let yourself believe  that a foreign girl with no name  could spend her life with the son of tywin lannister   i have a name  you have one name  as do i  here only the family name matters  what do you want from me lord varys  diamonds  id tell you to beware carrying so much wealth  but you know how to protect yourself  get on one of those ships  sail to pentos or lys or myr  you can buy a house with these diamonds  a very large house  hire servants  start a new life  a good life far from here  the mysterious foreign beauty  youll have suitors lining up  why do you want me to leave  tyrion lannister is one of the few people alive  who could make this country a better place  he has the mind for it he has the will  he has the right last name  and you  you are a complication  i know you love him  and i know its true love not bought by gold and silver  im not asking you to leave him for money  im asking you to leave  because your presence in the capital  endangers him  this will never be your home my lady  find a true home somewhere far from here  while theres still time  lord varys  if he wants me to leave he can tell me himself  keep up  i dont think i can my lord  its not easy being drunk all the time  everyone would do it if it were easy  leave  so enjoying married life  an unhappy wife is a wine merchants best friend  she doesnt deserve this  deserve  be careful with that  start trying to work out who deserves what  and before long youll spend the rest of your days  weeping for each and every person in the world  theres nothing worse than a lateblooming philosopher  will you be facing your marriage to ser loras  with the same philosophical spirit  i wont be marrying ser loras  i seem to remember saying something similar  about my own marriage  youre not me  you want to make things better for sansa  give her a child  so you can tell father it was you  who finally talked me into it  so she can have some happiness in her life  you have children  how happy would you say you are  not very  but if it werent for my children  id have thrown myself from the highest window in the red keep  theyre the reason im alive  even joffrey  even joffrey  he was all i had once  before myrcella was born  i used to spend hours  looking at him  his wisps of hair  his tiny little hands and feet  he was such a jolly little fellow  you always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies  we should have known even then we should have known  its nonsense  whenever he was with me he was happy  and no one can take that away from me  not even joffrey  how it feels to have someone  someone of your own  how long does it go on  until weve dealt with all our enemies  every time we deal with an enemy  we create two more  then i suppose it will go on for quite a long time  im telling you thats what she did  sounded like a cow in heat   aye not for long  thats right  black walder shut her up right quick  none of the starks had much to say about the end of that meal  ill tell you what though  the hardest thing was getting that wolfs head to stay on the body   you sewed it on  i did  i bet there were 1000 men claiming they were the one  it was me  and malcolm and talbott  well the thing was so heavy it fell off the first time  took the skin right with it  what we ended up having to do was hook the needle  right under the collarbone  give it a nice firm mooring and  what do you want   mind if i keep warm  fuck off  but im hungry  does fuck off mean something different where youre from  ive got money  what kind of coin is that  its worth a lot  sorry  little shit  fool  where did you get the knife  from you  is that the

credit  i have faith and my faith has been rewarded  your grace the world has got so far bent  ive seen things crawl out of nightmares  but my eyes were open  i dont know if robb stark died because of the red womans sorcery  or because at war men die all the time  but i do know that uniting the seven kingdoms  with blood magic is wrong  it is evil  and you are not an evil man  do you know who had this table carved and painted ser davos  aegon targaryen  and do you know how aegon targaryen conquered westeros  on the back of his dragon balerion the dread  he had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced  and a smaller army but he had three dragons  dragons are magic ser davos  my enemies have made my kingdom bleed  i will not forget that  i will not forgive that  i will punish them with any arms  at my disposal  you do not need to burn the boy  if what you say is true  a drop of his blood killed robb stark  and our king is still no closer to the iron throne  a great gift requires a great sacrifice  his name is gendry  hes a good lad  a poor lad from flea bottom  who happens to be your nephew  what is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom  everything  the boy must die   what
