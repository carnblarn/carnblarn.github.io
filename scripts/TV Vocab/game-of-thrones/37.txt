                theme music playing   i made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head  on your ungrateful neck a little while longer  tyrion im sorry what am i grateful for  the opportunity to live and die at the wall  as punishment for a crime i did not commit  you threw your life away you threw it away  its not a joke you understand that dont you  of course its a joke just not a very funny one  i couldnt  i couldnt listen to her  standing there telling her lies  i couldnt do it  you fell in love with a whore  yes i fell in love with a whore  and i was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me  that deal you made  it was everything father wanted  you do see that  he gets you back as his heir  the future lord of the rock  and he ships me off to castle black  out of sight at last  all so perfect  it felt good to take that from him  he knows im innocent and hes willing to sacrifice me anyway  hes willing to sacrifice any of us  not you  youre the golden son  you could kill a king lose a hand  fuck your own sister youll always be the golden son  careful  im the last friend youve got  at least i got to tell them what they really are  yes brilliant speech  theyll be talking about it for days to come  i thought you were a realist  didnt realize youd die for pride  dont give up on me just yet  i survived one trial by combat  even though you werent there to save me  i cant save you this time either  my training has proved  that i cant beat a stable boy with my left hand  wheres your sense of adventure  even if you lose imagine the look  on fathers face when you fall   chuckles  our family name snuffed out  with a single swing of the sword  it is tempting  laughs  well  bronn fought for me once hell do it again  if he wins  i expect ill be in his debt  for the rest of my life  if he wins  will you find him for me  who does cersei plan on naming as a champion  i hope its ser meryn trant  id enjoy watching bronn disembowel that pompous child beater  no  not ser meryn  shouting  gasping  guard go on move it  and you  come on  shouting  mercy  please  please mercy  grunting  shouts  ser gregor welcome to the capital  thank you for riding here so quickly  you seem to be in good form  who am i fighting  does it matter  could be food  could be soldiers  man groaning  you shouldnt be sitting out here like this  where else to sit  tried to walk back to my hut  hurt too much  then i remembered they burned my hut down  who were they  i stopped asking a while ago  thats not gonna get better  doesnt seem so  a bad way to go  havent you had enough  of what  i know  time to go  take matters into my own hands  groans  the thought has occurred to me  so why go on  habit  nothing could be worse than this  maybe nothing is worse than this  nothing isnt better or worse than anything  nothing is just nothing  who are you  my name is arya  arya stark  you her father  her captor  bringing her to her aunt for ransom  a fair exchange that is  always held to the notion of fair exchange  in all my dealings  you give me i give you  fair  a balance  no balance anymore  groans  could i have a drink  dying is thirsty work  wish it were wine  so do i  grunts  thats where the heart is  thats how you kill a man  grunting  neck snaps  groaning  the fuck you doing  theres a price on your head  guess thats what the king does when you tell him to fuck off  the kings dead  he drank poisoned wine at his own wedding  the bounty on you is for killing lannister soldiers   and you thought you were going to collect it  didnt think very hard did you  you were yorens prisoners when he was taking me to the wall  he told me hed fuck me bloody with a stick  this days really not working out the way you planned  he on your little list  he cant be  i dont know his name  whats your name   rorge  thank you  gasps  youre learning    horn blows  man rangers returning  hammering metal  man they return    rangers returning  greetings  man didnt think id see you again  all right jon  welcome back brother  men shouting  lord snow  ghost barks  this is no place for wild beasts  lock him away  or ill let hobb throw him in tonights stew  men shouting  come on ghost  mances army was closing in on crasters keep when we left  we saw their campfires from osrics hill  theyll reach the wall before the next full moon  im surprised you didnt ride over and say hello  the kingbeyondthewall is your old friend isnt he  we need to prepare  weve been preparing  we should seal the tunnel  men murmuring  plug it with rocks and ice  flood it and let it freeze  alliser and how would we range north   we wouldnt  man coward  you would cut off our legs  pluck out our eyes  leave us cowering behind the wall  hoping for the storm to pass  we cant defend the gate against 100000 men  this castle has stood for thousands of years  the nights watch has defended her for thousands of years  and in all those centuries we have never sealed the tunnel  have you ever seen a giant ser alliser  i have  the bars on those gates are four inches thick  coldrolled steel  they wont stop them  remind me which order you belong to lord snow  the stewards  are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel  no  who would that be   the builders  ah the builders  first builder yarwyck  lord snow here recommends sealing the tunnel  leaving us unable to carry out our duties  as sworn brothers of the nights watch  do you agree with him  no  alliser given your deep knowledge of the wildling army lord snow  you and tarly will take night duties atop the wall  until the full moon  men laughing  moving on  first builder well need 100 barrels of pitch brought atop the wall  yarwyck aye  door opens  footsteps  my lord  you have new clothes  do you like em eh  gloves are doeskin  softer than a virgins thighs  i sent for you days ago   ive been a bit busy  doing what  my lonesome bachelor days are over  im to wed lollys stokeworth  lollys stokeworth  she doesnt strike me as your sort of girl  i wouldnt say i had a single sort of girl  shes dimwitted  if i wanted wits id marry you  when my sister arranged this love match  did she mention that lollys has an older sister  falyse  aye i did know about the older sister  and you understand the rules of inheritance  falyse is 40 and barren  she still gets castle stokeworth when her father dies  she does  unless she happens to perish before her father  then lollys gets the castle  what ladies fall from their horses  and snap their pretty necks all the time  you and my sister deserve each other  why did you bother to come here  you once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out  youd double their price  is it two wives you want or two castles  one of each will do  but if you want me to kill the mountain for you  itd better be a damn big castle  im a bit short on castles at the moment  but i can offer you gold and gratitude  i have gold  what can i buy with gratitude  you might be surprised  a lannister always pays his debts  your sisters a lannister too  my wife is heir to winterfell  if i emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders  i may one day rule the north in her name  i could carve you out a big piece of it  if and may and could  its bloody cold up north  lollys is soft and warm  and close  if i gave you the choice between fucking lollys  and fighting the mountain youd have your britches down  and your cock out before i could blink  does he frighten you so much  id be a bloody fool if he didnt frighten me  hes freakish big and freakish strong  and quicker than youd expect for a man of that size  maybe i could take him  dance around until hes so tired  of hacking at me he dropped his sword  get him off his feet somehow  but one misstep  snaps fingers and im dead  why should i risk it  because youre my friend  aye im your friend  and when have you ever risked your life for me  i like you  pampered little shit that you are  i just like myself more  i understand  im sorry it has to be this way  why are you sorry  because youre an evil bastard  with no conscience and no heart  thats what i liked about you in the first place  we had some good days together  yes we did  bangs on door  what will you do  i suppose ill have to kill the mountain myself  wont that make for a great song  i hope to hear them sing it one day  bird screeching  how did you get in here  your door is well guarded  but your window is not  i swam to an island a mile offshore for these  dont do that again  never met a woman who didnt like wildflowers  these are my private quarters  if i want you here i will summon you  forgive me my queen i live to serve you  tell me why youre here  i came to ask a favor  i only have two talents in this world  war and women  you are staying here in meereen to rule  that is a wise decision i respect it  but here in meereen i cannot pursue my talents  ive ordered the second sons to patrol the streets  to stop the revenge killing  youve ordered us to be night watchmen  and as for women  there are thousands in meereen you can pursue  there is only one  and she does not want me  you swore me your sword  my sword is yours till the day i die  so if i command you to stay in meereen  and patrol the streets  ill stay in meereen and patrol the streets  send me to kill your enemies  any enemy anywhere  let me do what i do best  very well  do what you do best  take off your clothes  knocks  oh  come in my queen please  i didnt mean to disturb you my lady  you could never disturb me  i just wanted to speak with you before we left  could you bring me that vial over there  the blue one  no no no not that one  you dont even want to touch that one  next to it  thats the one  inhales  when i looked into the flames this morning  the lord spoke to me  he said  tonight you will have your last good bath in a long while  make it count  a joke  not a very good one im afraid  it was i  humor isnt my strength  thats because most jokes are lies  and youre devoted to the truth  if theyre lies my lady arent they best avoided  not always  most of these powders and potions  are lies  deceptions to make men think they witnessed our lords power  once they step into his light they will see the lie for what it was  a trick that lead them to the truth  a pinch of this powder in a bonfire  will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky  and this one creates a black smoke  that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear  and a drop of this in any mans wine  will drive him wild with lust  did you use it with stannis  no  dont be upset  men never crave what they already have  its only flesh  it needs what it needs  no act done in service of the lord  can ever be called a sin  i thank god every day for bringing you to us  and stannis to you  he wants to bring shireen with us  i think that would be illadvised  my daughter has heretical tendencies as youre well aware  i dont know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me  but whichever the case she should stay home  i understand how you feel  hmm  but that is impossible  why  you dont need powders and potions my queen  you dont need lies  you are strong enough to look into the lords light  and see his truth for yourself  however harsh it is  however hard for us to understand  you dont need my help  but i will need yours soon  when we set sail your daughter must be with us  the lord needs her  jorah the andal  are you here to see our queen  shes in a good mood  khaleesi   youre here early  later than some  you dont approve  its not a question of approval its a question of trust  you neither approve nor trust  why would i the mans a sellsword  didnt you fight for the golden company  before pledging your sword to my brother  i did  i trust you  daario naharis killed his captains  and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands  how could you ever have faith in a man like that  i could never have faith in a man like daario  thats why ive sent him and the second sons to retake yunkai   you have  i have  without you there to rule khaleesi  i fear the masters will simply bide their time  wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control  that is why ive ordered daario to execute every master in yunkai  the masters tear babies from their mothers arms  they mutilate little boys by the thousands  they train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men  they treat men like beasts as you said yourself  herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands  is also treating men like beasts  the slaves you freed  brutality is all theyve ever known  if you want them to know something else  youll have to show it to them  and repay the slavers with what kindness  a fine a stern warning  its tempting to see your enemies as evil all of them  but theres good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought  let the priests argue over good and evil  slavery is real  i can end it i will end it  and i will end those behind it  i sold men into slavery khaleesi  and now you are helping me show them to freedom  i wouldnt be here to help you if ned stark had done to me  what you want to do to the masters of yunkai  the man who came to me the other day about burying his father  hizdahr zo loraq  he will accompany the second sons  and serve as my ambassador to yunkai  he will tell the masters what has happened in meereen  he will explain the choice they have before them  they can live in my new world  or they can die in their old one  well go and catch daario before he leaves  tell him i changed my mind  yes khaleesi  no  tell him you changed my mind  hound grunts rat cunts  fucking whore  youre doing it wrong  you need to burn away that horrible bit there  otherwise its gonna get infected and fester  i know you dont like fire but if you dont do it right  no fire  itll only take a second   it wont hurt that much  no fire  shut up about it  shut up about everything  thanks to you im a walking bag of silver  anywhere the lannisters hold sway  which is everywhere between where we are now  and where were going  im as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village  getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten  no reward is worth this much trouble  wish id never laid eyes on you  you say your brother gave you that sword  my brother gave me this  it was just like you said a while back  pressed me to the fire  like i was a nice juicy mutton chop  why  thought i stole one of his toys  i didnt steal it i was just playing with it  the pain was bad  the smell was worse  but the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it  my father who protected him  told everyone my bedding caught fire  you think youre on your own  let me wash it out  and help you sew it up at least  brienne bit of comfort never hurt anyone  weve been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks  i think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night  and a hot meal not cooked by you  couldnt agree more my lady  just dont start expecting silk underclothes  not working for your former lord any longer   yes my lady  dont get drunk  no my lady  hot pie can i get you anything else  no this will do nicely thank you  kidney pie is wonderful  thanks  i do my best  a good kidney pie is all about the ingredients  flour lard water eggs milk  easy enough but the meat  peacetime or not getting your hands on a good bottom round steak  and calves kidneys is not easy  i mean some people settle for plain old beef kidneys  got no right to cook anything them  oh and the gravy  dont get me started on the gravy  very difficult to get right  see a lot of people give up on the gravy  you cannot give up on the gravy  no gravy no pie  simple as that  thats nice armor are you a knight  no  oh its just people with armor are usually knights  generally speaking from kings landing though arent you  from there myself originally flea bottom born and bred  what brings you to these parts  were looking for someone  someone in particular maybe they came in here  a lot of people come in here just the other day we had 17  a girl tall red hair very pretty  her name is sansa stark but she may be using a different name  starks  what like them lot from winterhell  no aint seen anyone like that  i heard they was all traitors  dont need no traitors in here  i pledged my life to their mother catelyn stark  i swore to her id bring her daughters home  sure i cant get you a bit more kidney pie  what  its nothing my lady  you wouldnt be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing  dont want to offend my lady truly i dont  youre not interesting enough to be offensive  the lannisters want lady sansa  the lannisters have money  people kill for money  i dont think we should be telling people  were searching for lady sansa  my lady my lord could i have a word  what about not kidney pie  you seem like a proper lady  someone who could be trusted  i never met no sansa stark  but i know her sister  arya  no ones seen arya stark since her father was beheaded  shes presumed dead  she werent when i last spoke to her   when was that  heading up north with the nights watch  she was all dressed up as a boy  like your ladyship only without the armor  going by the name arry   so what happened to her  well  the quick version  the lannisters took us prisoner  we escaped  the brotherhood took us prisoner  they sold me to the innkeep  they were gonna sell arya to her mother at riverrun  along with another prisoner  big ugly fellow foul mouth  and a face like a halfburnt ham    not friendly  the hound  thats the one  if you find her could you give her this  she liked the last one i gave her  but well this one turned out better  um you were saying  brienne her mothers dead grandfathers dead  walder frey is the new lord of riverrun  the brotherhood isnt going to riverrun  theyll take her to the eyrie my lady  why the eyrie  her aunt lysa arryn  catelyn starks sister  shes aryas last living relative with money  she hates the lannisters  lord tyrion made sure i knew  which house married which and who hated who  sansa could be there too  aye my lady  could be  you sure about this  no  door opens  i imagined youd be back at the brothel at this hour  i did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day  mm do tell  ive got every kind of filth down here  except the kind i like  your sister  oh  cersei approached me  we spoke a great deal about her daughter  how worried your sister is about her  she was trying very hard to pretend  she had not come to sway me against you  i think she may have even believed it herself  making honest feelings do dishonest work  is one of her many gifts  it was difficult for her to hide her true intentions  it is rare to meet a lannister  who shares my enthusiasm for dead lannisters  she desperately wants to see you killed  she didnt need to bother you  it looks as though ive taken care of that myself  the joy she will feel  when my head leaves my neck  shes wanted this for a long time  yes i know  we met you and i  many years ago  i think i would have remembered that  unlikely you had just been born  our father brought me and my sister elia with him  on a visit to casterly rock  my first time away from dorne  i didnt like anything about the rock  not the food not the weather  not your accents  nothing  but the biggest disappointment  you  you and my family have more in common than you might admit  the whole way from dorne  all anyone talked about was the monster  that had been born to tywin lannister  a head twice the size of his body  a tail between his legs  claws one red eye  the privates of both a girl and a boy  that would have made things so much easier  when we met your sister she promised she would show you to us  every day we would ask  every day she would say soon  then she and your brother  took us to your nursery and  she unveiled the freak  your head was a bit large  your arms and legs were a bit small  but no claw  no red eye no tail between your legs  just a tiny pink cock  we didnt try to hide our disappointment  thats not a monster i told cersei  thats just a baby  and she said he killed my mother  and she pinched your little cock so hard  i thought she might pull it off  until your brother made her stop  it doesnt matter she told us  everyone says he will die soon  i hope they are right  he should not have lived this long  well  sooner or later cersei always gets what she wants  and what about what i want  justice  for my sister and her children  if you want justice  youve come to the wrong place  i disagree  ive come to the perfect place  i want to bring those who have wronged me to justice  and all those who have wronged me are right here  i will begin with ser gregor clegane  who killed my sisters children  and then raped her with their blood still on his hands  before killing her too  i will be your champion  exhales  hello robin  what are you doing  im building my home winterfell  at least i think i am  i havent been back there in a very long time  why did you leave  its a long story  i stay here in the eyrie  mother says its dangerous on the roads and i have to keep myself safe  because im the lord of the vale  and the lord of the vale is a very important person  yes you certainly are  when will you go back  probably never  my family doesnt live there anymore  and someone burned it down  oh  does winterfell have a moon door  no im afraid not  its not high up in the mountains its down on the ground   that sounds dangerous  chuckles   how do you make people fly  we dont  what do you do with all the bad people  and the scary people and the people you dont like  i never did anything with them at all  girls didnt take part in that where i came from  well im lord of the vale  when i grow up ill be able to fly anybody who bothers me  or you when we get married  you can tell me if you dont like somebody  and then we can bring them back here and whoosh  right through the moon door  i like the sound of that  lets put a moon door in your winterfell  all right  it can go in here in this big tower  careful youve ruined it  now im going to have to rebuild the whole thing   i didnt ruin it  you did  it was already ruined because it didnt have a moon door  i was fixing it  knocking things down isnt fixing them   its ruining them  i didnt ruin it   youre being stupid  i didnt ruin it  grunting  gasps   crying  robin im sorry i  littlefinger children    i hit him  yes i saw  i shouldnt have done that  no his mother should have  a long time ago  consider it a step in the right direction  if he tells aunt lysa  let me worry about aunt lysa  i was trying to remember what everything looked like  ill never see it again  a lot can happen between now and never  if you want to build a better home  first you must demolish the old one  why did you really kill joffrey  tell me why  i loved your mother more than you could ever know  given the opportunity what do we do to those  whove hurt the ones we love  in a better world  one where love  could overcome strength and duty  you might have been my child  but we dont live in that world  youre more beautiful than she ever was  lord baelish  call me petyr  wind whistling  you wanted to see me aunt lysa  come here sansa  do you know how far the fall is  no  neither do i precisely  hundreds of feet  its fascinating  what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height  the impact breaks them right apart  like eggs dropped on the floor  sometimes pieces remain intact  youll find the head sitting on its own  every hair in place  blue eyes staring at nothing  i know what you did  im so sorry aunt lysa  i never should have hit robin i know it i promise it wont happen  dont be coy with me you little whore  you kissed him you kissed petyr   i didnt you dont understand  i saw you  you cant lie to me because i saw it with my own eyes   he kissed me i pulled away  liar   whimpering  whore he is mine  my father my husband my sister  they all stood between us and now theyre all dead  thats what happens to people who stand between petyr and me  look down  look down look down look down  littlefinger lysa  let her go  you want her  this emptyheaded child  let her go  shes just like her mother shell never love you  i lied for you  i killed for you  why did you bring her here why  ill send her away  i swear on my life  i swear to all the gods  let her go lysa  crying  whimpering  sobbing  oh my sweet wife  my sweet silly wife  i have only loved one woman  only one  my entire life  your sister  screaming
