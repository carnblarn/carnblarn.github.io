                1 this march is a distraction  my grandfathers funeral is not a distraction   are we riding to battle at riverrun  no  then its a distraction   theyre growing fast  not fast enough  i need an army  well be in astapor by nightfall  some say the unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world  the greatest slavesoldiers in the world   who are you  thoros of myr   who do you fight for  the brotherhood without banners  the lords of westeros want to burn the countryside  were trying to save it   your sister sent me  yara  ill come for you tonight when the castle sleeps  i have been searching for you daenerys stormborn  to ask your forgiveness  i am barristan selmy kingsguard to your father  i will not fail you again   whats wrong with him  hes a warg  he can enter the mind of animals see through their eyes  hes scouting for us  orell where were you this time  the fist of the first men   what did you see  dead crows  get up tarly i forbid you to die  youre responsible for him  make sure he gets back alive  so good to see you again clegane  girl  what in seven hells  are you doing with the stark bitch  get up  ah  let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want  enough to buy me a new head   if i may nephew  i encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants  at the stone mill which may have some bearing  why dont you shut your mouth about that damned mill  and dont call him nephew he is your king  robb knows i meant him no disr  youre lucky im not your king  i wouldnt let you wave your blunders around  like a victory flag  my blunder sent tywins mad dog  scurrying back to casterly rock with his tail between his legs  i think king robb understands were not gonna win this war  if hes the only one winning any battles  no theres glory enough to go around  its not about glory  your instructions were to wait for him to come to you  i seized an opportunity  what value was the mill  the mountain was garrisoned across the river from it  is he there now  of course not we took the fight to him  he could not withstand us  i wanted to draw the mountain into the west  into our country where we could surround him and kill him  i wanted him to chase us  which he would have done because he is a mad dog  without a strategic thought in his head  i could have that head on a spike by now  instead i have a mill  we took hostages  willem lannister martyn lannister  willem and martyn lannister are 14 years old  martyn is 15 i believe  tywin lannister has my sisters  have i sued for peace  no  do you think hell sue for peace  because we have his fathers  brothers greatgrandsons  no  how many men did you lose   but for every man we lost the lannisters  we need our men more than tywin needs his  im sorry   i didnt know  you would have  right here today at this gathering if you had been patient  we seem to be running short of patience here  you know who isnt  tywin lannister  intimate lovely table  better chairs than the old small council chamber  conveniently close to your own quarters i like it  what news of jaime   have known about his escape for weeks  collectively you control more spies and informants  than the rest of the world combined  do you mean to tell me that none of you  has any notion of where he is   we are trying my lord  try harder  what do we have then  robb stark and most of his bannermen are in riverrun  for the funeral of his grandfather lord hoster tully  in starks absence roose bolton holds harrenhal  which would seem to make him lord of harrenhal   in practice if not in name  well let him have it  the name suits our purposes  far more than that useless pile of rubble  the lord of harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow arryn  for which i am extremely grateful to you my lord  lady arryn and i have known each other since we were children  she has always been  positively predisposed toward me  a successful courtship would make lord baelish  acting lord of the vale  titles do seem to breed titles  youll leave for the eyrie as soon as possible  and bring lysa arryn into the fold  then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list  of people who have taken up arms against him  far be it from me to hinder true love  but lord baelishs absence would present certain problems  the royal wedding may end up  being the most expensive event in living memory  summer has ended hard days lie ahead  not a good time to leave the crowns finances unattended  fully agreed  which is why im naming you new master of coin  master of coin  it would appear to be a position that best suits your talents  im quite good at spending money  but a lifetime of outrageous wealth  hasnt taught me much about managing it  i have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge  hear hear  he lifted her high in the air   he sniffed and roared and smelled her there   she kicked and wailed a maid so fair   but he licked the honey from her hair   from there to here from here to there   all black and brown and covered with hair   he smelled that girl in the summer air   the bear the bear and the maiden fair   i hope youre pleased  if you had armed me they never would have taken us  you were armed when we were taken  i was in chains if you recall  our little match would have ended quite quick  if my hands werent bound  all my life ive been hearing jaime lannister  what a brilliant swordsman  you were slower than i expected  and more predictable  ive been sitting in a muddy pen  wrapped in chains for the past year  and im a woman i was still beating you  you were not beating me  maybe you were as good as people said  once  or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name  when we make camp tonight youll be raped  more than once  none of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman  youd be wise not to resist   would i  theyll knock your teeth out  you think i care about my teeth  no i dont think you care about your teeth  if you fight them they will kill you  do you understand  im the prisoner of value not you  let them have what they want what does it matter   what does it matter  close your eyes  pretend theyre renly  if you were a woman you wouldnt resist  youd let them do what they wanted  if i was a woman id make them kill me  but im not thank the gods  if i had a proper forge i could make it good as new  doesnt have to look pretty  it just has to keep the arrows out of my heart  why are you helping him  he takes us prisoner and now hes our friend  youre not our prisoner little lady   what am i  our guest  no ones put any chains on you  so i can walk away then  these woods arent safe for ned starks daughter  youre lucky we found you  you think youre good with that bow you little twat  better than anyone youve ever met  a cowards weapon  i like to fight up close  i like to see a mans face when i put the steel in him  why so you can kiss him  you remember the last time you were here  looks like every other shit inn on the road  now apologies but youre one ugly fucker  and id rather not see you no more  watch your head  off we go  walk up  what are you doing were about to leave  im staying  youre what  i baked some brown bread for the innkeep  and she said she never had better  told thoros shes keeping me as a payment  for all the free meals shes given him  anyway its not me the brotherhood wants  my brother aint no king  im not a stark of winterhell  winterfell   you sure  im sure  well i made you something  what is it  its a wolf  yes it is  thats the tail  yeah  well be safe  yeah you too  dont get stabbed  you dont  burn your fingers  goodbye hot pie  goodbye arry  up you go little lady  hey hot pie  its really good  a person could almost be forgiven  for forgetting were at war  it often comforts me to think that even in wars darkest days  in most places in the world  absolutely nothing is happening  ive missed you uncle  father missed you too  from the day you left  maybe he never said it in so many words  maybe  your father was a stubborn old ox  i was surprised when he died  didnt think death had the patience  im glad you were with him  i wish to the gods i had been  did you make peace in the end  after 30 years of fighting  i dont think he remembered what started it  he asked me to stop calling myself blackfish  he said it was an old joke  and it was never funny to begin with  i told him people had been calling me blackfish  for so long they dont remember my real name  every time he would leave for the capital  or fight in a campaign  id see him off  wait for me little cat hed say  wait for me  and ill come back to you  and i would sit at this window  every day when the sun came up waiting  i wonder  how many times did bran or rickon  stare across the moors of winterfell  waiting for me to return  i will never see them again  you mustnt think it  we dont know the truth  they could be in hiding  robb believes theyre alive  and he must go on believing  hes got to remain strong if hes to prevail  and you must remain strong for him  youre robb starks wife  hold still  is it true what they say about him  i dont know what do they say about him  that he can turn into a wolf at night  true  and he eats the flesh of his enemies  true  youre a lannister arent you  martyn lannister  martyn lannister  youve nothing to fear  my husband doesnt eat children  unless its a full moon  its not a full moon tonight is it  see  nothing to fear  always the artists  its only horses  no men  you said there was dead crows  there was  how many men were here  about 300  and you know what those men are now  were all the same to them meat for their army  do you think anyone got away  its not impossible  you dont go far betting against mormont  but dead or alive  he took a big gamble coming north  and he lost  his best fighting men are dead  and whether hes lord commander of the nights watch  or a blueeyed corpse  hes a long way from home  tormund  climb the wall  take orell and 20 good men  and take this one  he knows castle blacks defenses better than any of us  and if hes useful good if not  throw him off the wall  see if crows can fly  were finally going to war old friend  hide near castle black  when i give the signal hit them in the night  theyve got a big old wall to hide behind  but it only guards one side   well meet again  aye   if you do your job  ah  how will we see your signal  send your eagle above the wall every night  when its time im going to light the biggest fire  the north has ever seen  ghost  what have we here frozen crows  weve come a

fear of whats out there  when the white cold comes  your swords and cloaks and bloody fires wont help you  the only ones left will be those who are right with the gods  the real gods  go tell her she can bite down on a rag  or she can bite down on my fist  women  that sow right there gave birth  to a litter of eight  barely a grunt  and shes almost as fat as this one here  now why dont you dine on him  carve off what you need as you go  well look at him hes a walking feast  here we are  sharpen these for me would ya  i see the head push  thats it  youre nearly there  one more push should do it  what is it what is it  keep quiet  if you cant ride we dont stand a chance  i can ride  youre sure  ride east follow the rising sun  your sisters waiting for you  ill make you a lord of the iron islands for this  were not in the iron islands   go  come on  come on come on  come on come on  come on back  you refuse to tell me where youre going  i dont know yet the fires will show me   how long will you be gone  i dont know  youre abandoning me  i will never abandon you  you are the son of fire   i am sworn to serve you  then serve me  when i return you will understand  my enemies think

im not so easily killed men have been trying for years  i want you  your fires burn low my king  there is another way a better way  you told me your magic requires a kings blood   yes  im the one true king  you are  but there are others with your blood in their veins  you will sit on the iron throne  but first there must be sacrifices  the lord of light demands it  the walk of punishment is a warning your grace   to whom  to any slave who contemplates doing  whatever these slaves did  give me your water  khaleesi this man has been sentenced to death  here drink  leave this place your grace  leave tonight i beg you  and what is she to do for soldiers  we can find sellswords in pentos and myr  is it we already ser barristan  if you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built you must win it  that will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done  the blood of my enemies not the blood of innocents  how many wars have you fought in ser barristan   three  have you ever seen a war  where innocents didnt die by the thousands  i was in kings landing after the sack khaleesi  you know what i saw butchery  babies children old men  more women raped than you can count  theres a beast in every man  and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand  but the unsullied are not men  they do not rape  they do not put cities to the sword unless theyre ordered to do so  if you buy them the only men theyll kill are those you want dead  do you disagree ser barristan  when your brother rhaegar led his army into battle at the trident  men died for him because they believed in him  because they loved him  not because theyd been bought at a slavers auction  i fought beside the last dragon on that day your grace  i bled beside him  rhaegar fought valiantly rhaegar fought nobly  and rhaegar died  did you know him well ser barristan  i did your grace finest man i ever met  i wish i had known him  but he was not the last dragon  all  did this ones ears mishear your grace  they did not i want to buy them all  _  _  _  _  there are 8000 unsullied in astapor  is this what you mean by all  yes 8000  and the ones still in training as well  _  _  master greizhen says they cannot sell halftrained boys  if they fail on the battlefield  they will bring shame upon all of astapor  i will have them all or take none  many will fall in battle  ill need the boys to pick up the swords they drop  _  master kraznys says you cannot afford this  _  your ship will buy you  because master kraznys is generous  the gold you have left is worth 10  but good master kraznys will give you 20  the dothraki you have with you  _  the dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed  but master kraznys will give you three unsullied  for all of them  _  master kraznys asks how you propose to pay  for the remaining  i have dragons ill give you one  you will win the throne with dragons not slaves your grace  khaleesi please  three dragons   one  two  one  they want the biggest one   done  done  ill take you as well now  youll be master kraznys gift to me  a token of a bargain well struck  _  _  khaleesi a dragon is worth more than any army  aegon targaryen proved that  youre both here to advise me  i value your advice but if you ever question me  in front of strangers again  youll be advising someone else  is that understood  do you have a name  this ones name is missandei your grace  do you have a family a mother and a father  youd return to if you had the choice  no your grace no family living  you belong to me now it is your duty to tell me the truth  yes your grace lying is a great offense  many of those on the walk of punishment were taken there for less  i offered water to one of the slaves dying on the walk of punishment  do you know what he said to me let me die  there are no masters in the grave your grace  is it true what master kraznys told me  about the unsullied about their obedience  all questions have been taken from them  they obey that is all  once they are yours they are yours  they will fall on their swords if you command it  and what about you you know that im taking you to war  you may go hungry you may fall sick  you may be killed  valar morghulis  yes all men must die  but we are not men  a surprising place to keep the royal ledgers  im surprised youre surprised  this is the safest place in the city  not for bastards  thats all of them my lord  thank you my dear pod  pod take them outside   ill be there in a moment  yes my lord  i hear you owe that boy a significant debt  only my life  not all that significant im afraid  you should have him knighted  if only the master of coin had such power  if only  i owe you a significant debt  our redheaded friend  you secured her release when the queen detained her  oh that  of course a simple misunderstanding  apparently her grace believed  that you two had some sort of special relationship  we dont i did fuck her once   i know  but we dont  i know  but how would the queen get that idea  why dont you ask her  any advice for me on my new position  keep a low profile  if i had a gold dragon  for every time i heard that joke id be richer than you are  well you are richer than i am  good point  theyre only numbers numbers on paper  once you understand that its easy to make them behave  trivial even  you want a real challenge  try whores  ive tried quite a few  well lots of work to do  enjoy the eyrie  come on im here later  come on  tonight then  looks like dull reading  you think all reading is dull reading  its an opinion i share with some of the finest men i know  the secret history of the seven kingdoms is written in these pages  unless lord twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers  to hide what hes really up to  unless he made it all up yes   podrick do keep up  yes my lord   podrick  yes my lord  after a long consultation with my colleague ser bronn  i finally found a suitable reward  for the services youve provided over and above  what might be considered reasonable  tell me pod  have you ever been with a woman   no my lord  wonderful  genna specializes in firsttimers  shes not bad with secondtimers either  uh my lord  a fair enough repayment for putting your spear  through my wouldbe killers face wouldnt you say  now as it happens  marei  is quite the spear handler herself  shes here to thank you for staying by my side  as the battle raged all around me  hes handsome  you didnt tell me he was handsome  kayla is famous from here to volantis  in certain circles  one of four women in the world  who can perform a proper meereenese knot  my lord i dont even  shes here to thank you  for being a thoroughly respectful fellow  whos never once failed to address me as my lord  be back in time for my supper  pace yourself lad  for years ive heard that littlefinger  is a magician  whenever the crown needs money he rubs his hands together  and poof mountains of gold  let me guess hes not a magician  no   hes stealing it  worse hes borrowing it  whats wrong with that  we cant afford to pay it back thats whats wrong with it  the crown owes millions to my father  seeing as its his grandsons ass on the throne  i imagine hell forgive that debt  forgive a debt my father  for a man of the world youre strangely naive  ive never borrowed money before  im not clear on the rules  well  ahem  the basic principle is  i lend you money  and after an agreed upon period of time  you return it with interest  and what if i dont  well you have to  but what if i dont  this is why i dont lend you money  anyway its not my father im worried about  its the iron bank of braavos  we owe them tens of millions  if we fail to repay these loans the bank will fund our enemies  one way or another they always get their gold back  ah the return of the conquering hero  does he have a little jaunt in his step  the lads practically skipping  you were gone a long time  i trust you got your moneys worth  or should i say my moneys worth  oh it was a gift podrick  this is more than i give you in a year  hes a squire you dont pay him  oh then its much more than i give you in a year  they wouldnt take it my lord  maybe theyre trying to curry some favor  with the new master of coin  have you ever known a whore to turn down gold  they were happy enough to take it when i gave it to them  what did you tell them  i didnt tell them anything   what did you do to them  lots of things  and they seemed to like these things  yes my lord  of course they seemed to like it  theyre paid to seem to like it  only they werent paid  what are you saying these ladies enjoyed him so much  they gave him the time for free  is that what youre telling us  sit down podrick  were going to need details  copious details  come on come on  come on

end of your days  and your sons will be rich men  and their sons after them  lands titles  youll have them all  the north cant win this war  youre a smart man you understand that  we have the numbers we have the gold  aye you have both  fighting bravely for a losing cause  is admirable  fighting for a winning cause  is far more rewarding  hard to argue with that  now that were speaking together man to man  i wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree  im not asking to be freed from my constraints  but if i could sleep lying down  my back would thank you for it  im not as young  and resilient as i was once  none of us are  unchain ser jaime from the tree  come on men  suppose youll be wanting something to eat  im famished actually  i think weve got a spare partridge on the fire
