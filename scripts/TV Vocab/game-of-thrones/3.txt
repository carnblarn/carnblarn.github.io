                2 welcome lord stark  grand maester pycelle has called a meeting of the small council  the honor of your presence is requested  get the girls settled in ill be back in time for supper   and jory you go with them  yes my lord  if youd like to change into something more appropriate  thank the gods youre here stark  about time we had some stern northern leadership  about glad to see youre protecting the throne  sturdy old thing  how many kings asses have polished it i wonder  um whats the line  the king shits and the hand wipes  very handsome armor   not a scratch on it  i know  people have been swinging at me for years but they always seem to miss  youve chosen your opponents wisely then  i have a knack for it  it must be strange for you coming into this room  i was standing right here when it happened  he was very brave your brother  your father too  they didnt deserve to die like that  nobody deserves to die like that  but you just stood there and watched  and watched  all the great knights of the seven kingdoms  you think anyone said a word lifted a finger  no lord stark  was silent as a crypt  except for the screams of course  and the mad king laughing  and later  when i watched the mad king die  i remembered him laughing as your father burned  it felt like justice  is that what you tell yourself at night  youre a servant of justice  that you were avenging my father when you  shoved your sword in aerys targaryens back  tell me  if id stabbed the mad king in the belly instead of the back  would you admire me more  you served him well  when serving was safe  lord stark  lord varys  i was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the kingsroad  we are all praying for prince joffreys full recovery  a shame you didnt say a prayer for the butchers son  renly youre looking well  and you look tired from the road  i told them this meeting could wait another day but  but we have a kingdom to look after  ive hoped to meet you for some time lord stark   no doubt lady catelyn has mentioned me  she has lord baelish  i understand you knew my brother brandon as well  all too well i still carry a token of his esteem  from navel to collarbone  perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with  it wasnt the man that i chose my lord  it was catelyn tully  a woman worth fighting for im sure youll agree  i humbly beg your pardon my lord stark  grand maester  how many years has it been   you were a young man  and you served another king  oh how forgetful of me  this belongs to you now  should we begin   without the king  winter may be coming  but im afraid the same cannot be said for my brother  his grace has many cares  he entrusts some small matters to us  that we might lighten the load  we are the lords of small matters here  my brother instructs us to stage a tournament  in honor of lord starks appointment as hand of the king   mmm how much  40000 gold dragons to the champion  20000 to the runnerup   can the treasury bear such expense  ill have to borrow it the lannisters will accommodate i expect  we already owe lord tywin 3 million gold whats another 80000  are you telling me the crown is three million in debt  im telling you the crown is six million in debt  how could you let this happen  the master of coin finds the money  the king and the hand spend it  i will not believe jon arryn  allowed robert to bankrupt the realm  lord arryn gave wise and prudent advice  but i fear his grace   doesnt always listen  counting coppers he calls it  ill speak to him tomorrow  this tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford  as you will but still wed best make our plans  there will be no plans  until i speak to robert  forgive me my lords im   i had a long ride  you are the kings hand  lord stark we serve at your pleasure   ow  please its nearly healed   its ugly  a king should have scars  you fought off a direwolf youre a warrior like your father  im not like him i didnt fight off anything  it bit me and all i did was scream  and the two stark girls saw it both of them  thats not true you killed the beast  you only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father  i didnt i  when aerys targaryen sat on the iron throne  your father was a rebel and a traitor  someday youll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it  do i have to marry her  yes  shes very beautiful and young  if you dont like her you only need to see her on formal occasions  and when the time comes to make little princes and princesses  and if youd rather fuck painted whores youll fuck painted whores  and if youd rather lie with noble virgins so be it  you are my darling boy and the world will be  exactly as you want it to be  do something nice for the stark girl   i dont want to  no but you will  the occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road  we allow the northerners too much power  they consider themselves our equals  how would you handle them  id double their taxes  and command them to supply   a royal army  why should every lord command his own men  its primitive no better than the hill tribes  we should have a standing army of men loyal to the crown  trained by experienced soldiers  instead of a mob of peasants whove never held pikes in their lives  and if the northerners rebel  id crush them  seize winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm  as warden of the north uncle kevan maybe  and these 10000 northern troops would they fight for you or their lord   for me im their king  mmhmm  but youve just invaded their homeland   asked them to kill their brothers  im not asking  the north cannot be held not by an outsider  its too big and too wild and when the winter comes  the seven gods together couldnt save you and your royal army  a good king knows when to save his strength  and when to destroy his enemies  so you agree  the starks are enemies  everyone who isnt us  is an enemy  enough of that young lady eat your food   im practicing  practicing for what   the prince  arya stop  hes a liar and a coward and he killed my friend  the hound killed your friend  the hound does whatever the prince tells him to do   youre an idiot  youre a liar and if you told the truth   mycah would be alive  enough  whats happening here  arya would rather act like a beast than a lady  go to your room well speak later  thats for you love  the same dollmaker makes all of princess myrcellas toys  dont you like it  i havent played with dolls since i was eight   may i be excused  youve barely eaten a thing  its all right go on  war was easier than daughters   go away  ned arya open the door  may i come in   whose sword is that  mine  give it to me  i know this makers mark this is mikkens work  where did you get this  this is no toy   little ladies shouldnt play with swords  i wasnt playing  and i dont want to be a lady  come here  now what do you want with this  its called needle  oh a blade with a name  and who were you hoping to skewer with needle  your sister  do you know the first thing about sword fighting  stick em with the pointy end  thats the essence of it  i was trying to learn  i asked mycah to practice with me  i asked him   it was my fault  no sweet girl  no no you didnt kill the butchers boy  i hate them i hate all of them  the hound the queen and the king  and joffrey and sansa  sansa was dragged before the king and queen  and asked to call the prince a liar  so was i he is a liar  shh darling listen to me  sansa will be married to joffreys someday  she cannot betray him  she must take his side even when hes wrong  but how you can let her marry someone like that  well  look at me  youre a stark of winterfell you know our words  winter is coming  you were born in the long summer  youve never known anything else  but now winter is truly coming  and in the winter we must protect ourselves  look after one another sansa is your sister  i dont hate her  not really  i dont want to frighten you  but i wont lie to you either  weve come to a dangerous place  we cannot fight a war amongst ourselves  all right  go on its yours  i can keep it  try not to stab your sister with it  if youre going to own a sword  youd better know how to use it  dont listen to it crows are all liars   i know a story about a crow  i hate your stories  i know a story about a boy who hated stories  i could tell you about ser duncan the tall  those were always your favorites  those werent my favorites  my favorites were the scary ones  oh my sweet summer child what do you know about fear  fear is for the winter  when the snows fall a hundred feet deep  fear is for the long night  when the sun hides for years  and children are born and live and die  all in darkness  that is the time for fear my little lord  when the white walkers move through the woods  thousands of years ago there came a night  that lasted a generation  kings froze to death in their castles  same as the shepherds in their huts  and women smothered their babies  rather than see them starve  and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks  so is this the sort of story that you like  in that darkness  the white walkers came for the first time  they swept through cities and kingdoms  riding their dead horses  hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds  what are you telling him now  only what what are the little lord wants to hear  get your supper i want some time with him   one time she told me  the sky is blue because we live inside the eye  of a blueeyed giant named macomber  maybe we do  how do you feel  you still dont remember anything  bran  ive seen you climb a thousand times  in the wind in the rain  a thousand times   you never fall  i did though  its true isnt it  what maester luwin says about my legs  id rather be dead   dont ever say that  id rather be dead  fewer eyes back here my lady  but still too many  its nine years since ive set foot in the capital  and no one knew who i was the last time i came either  my lady  welcome to kings landing lady stark would you mind following us  i would weve done nothing wrong  weve been instructed to escort you into the city  instructed  i dont know whos providing your instructions but  follow me lady stark  cat go on  go upstairs  you little worm  you take me for some backalley sally  you can drag into a  pssst  i meant no disrespect  to you of all people  how dare you bring me here  have you lost your mind  no one will come looking for you here isnt that what you wanted  im truly sorry about the locale  how did you know i was coming to kings landing  a dear friend told me   lady stark  lord varys  to see you again after so many years is a blessing  your poor hands  how did you know i was coming  knowledge is my trade my lady  did you bring the dagger with you by any chance  my little birds are everywhere  even in the north  they whisper to me the strangest stories  valyrian steel  do you know whose dagger this is  i must admit i do not  well well this is an historic day  something you dont know  that i do  theres only one dagger like this in all of the seven kingdoms   its mine  yours  at least it was until the tournament on prince joffreys last nameday  i bet on ser jaime in the jousting  as any sane man would  when the knight of the glowers unseated him  i lost this dagger  to whom  tyrion lannister  the imp  grenn show him what you farm boys are made of   if that were a real sword youd be dead  lord snow here grew up in a castle  spitting down on the likes of you  pyp  do you think ned starks bastard  bleeds like the rest of us  next  next  well lord snow  it appears youre the least useless person here  go clean yourselves up  theres only so much i can stomach in a day  a charming man  i dont need him to be charming  i need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways  into men of the nights watch  and hows that going commander mormont  slowly  a raven came  for ned starks son  good news or bad  both  lord stark  i meant to give you this earlier  so forgetful these days  a raven from winterfell this morning  good news  perhaps youd like to share it with your wife   my wife is in winterfell  is she  woman yes im looking at you  i thought that shed be safest in here  one of several such establishments i own  youre a funny man  huh a very funny man  ned  ah the starks  quick tempers slow minds  you broke my nose bastard  its an improvement  if we threw you over the wall i wonder how long it would take you to hit  i wonder if theyd find you before the wolves did  whatre you looking at half man  im looking at you  yes  youve got an interesting face  hmm very distinctive faces  all of you  and what do you care about our faces  its just i think they would look marvelous  decorating spikes in kings landing  perhaps ill write my sister the queen about it  well talk later lord snow  everybody knew what this place was  and no one told me  no one but you  my father knew  and he left me to rot at the wall all the same  grenns father left him too  outside a farmhouse when he was three  pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese  his little sister hadnt eaten in three days  he was given a choice his right hand or the wall  ive been asking the lord commander about them  fascinating stories  they hate me because im better than they are  its a lucky thing none of them were trained  by a masteratarms like your ser rodrik  i dont imagine any of them have ever held a real sword  before they came here  oh  your brother bran  hes woken up  the mere suggestion that the queens brother  tried to kill your boy would be considered treason  we have proof we have the blade  which lord tyrion will say was stolen from him  the only man who could say otherwise has no throat  thanks to your boys wolf  petyr has promised to help us find the truth  hes like a little brother to me ned  he would never betray my trust  ill try to keep you alive for her sake  a fools task admittedly  but ive never been able to refuse your wife anything  i wont forget this  youre a true friend  dont tell anyone i have a reputation to maintain   how could you be so stupid  calm down  hes a child   what were you thinking  i was thinking of us  youre a bit late to start complaining about it now   what has the boy told them  nothing  hes said nothing he remembers nothing  then what are you raving about  what if it comes back to him  if he tells his father what he saw  well say he was lying well say he was dreaming  well say whatever we like  i think we can outfox a 10yearold   and my husband  ill go to war with him if i have to  they can write a ballad about us  the war for cerseis cunt   let me go  never   let me go  the boy  wont talk  and if he does ill kill him  him ned stark the king the whole bloody lot of them  until you and i are the only people  left in this world  i wish i could see the girls   its too dangerous  just for a moment  until we know who our enemies are  i know they did it ned the lannisters  in my bones i know it  littlefingers right  i cant do anything without proof  and if you find the proof  then i bring it to robert  and hope hes still the man i once knew  you watch yourself on the road huh  that temper of yours is a dangerous thing  my temper gods be good  you nearly killed poor littlefinger yesterday  he still loves you  does he  off with you  yes its been a long time  but i still remember every face  you remember your first  of course your grace  who was it  a tyroshi   never learned the name  hmm  howd you do it  lance through the heart  quick one  lucky for you  mine was some tarly boy at the battle of summerhall  my horse took an arrow so i was on foot  slogging through the mud  he came running at me this dumb highborn lad  thinking he could end the rebellion  with single swing of his sword  i knocked him down with the hammer  gods i was strong then  caved in his breastplate  probably shattered every rib he had  stood over him hammer in the air  right before i brought it down he shouted wait  wait  they never tell you how they all shit themselves  they dont put that part in the songs  stupid boy  now the tarlys bend the knee  like everyone else  he could have lingered  on the edge of the battle with the smart boys  and today his wife would be making him miserable  his sons would be ingrates  and hed be waking three times in the night  to piss into a bowl wine  lancel gods what a stupid name  lancel lannister  who named you some halfwit with a stutter  what are you doing   its empty your grace  what do you mean its empty   theres no more wine  is that what empty means  so get more  tell your cousin to get in here  kingslayer  get in here  surrounded by lannisters  every time i close my eyes i see their blond hair  and their smug satisfied faces  it must wound your pride huh  standing out there like a glorified sentry  jaime lannister son of the mighty tywin  forced to mind the door while your king  eats and drinks and shits and fucks  so come on  were telling war stories  who was your first kill not counting old men  one of the outlaws in the brotherhood  i was there that day  you were only a squire  you killed simon toyne with a counter riposte  best move i ever saw  a good fighter toyne but he lacked stamina  your outlaw  any last words   i cut his head off so no  hmmm  what about aerys targaryen  what did the mad king say when you stabbed him in the back  i never asked  did he call you a traitor  did he plead for a reprieve  he said the same thing hed been saying for hours  burn them all  if thats all your grace  do the dothraki buy their slaves  the dothraki dont believe in money  most of their slaves were given to them as gifts   from whom  if you rule a city  and you see the horde approaching you have two choices  pay tribute or fight  an easy choice for most  of course sometimes its not enough  sometimes a khal feels insulted by the number of slaves hes given  he might think the men too weak or the women too ugly  sometimes a khal decides his riders havent had a good fight in months   and need the practice  kash qoy qoyi thira disse  tell them all to stop  you want the entire horde to stop  for how long  until i command them otherwise  youre learning to talk like a queen  not a queen  a khaleesi  annakhas dozgosores   you dare  you give commands to me to me  you do not command the dragon i am lord of the seven kingdoms  i dont take orders from savages  or their sluts do you hear me  hash shafka zali nharees zhey khaleesi  rakharo ask if you want him dead khaleesi  no  ishish chare acharoe hash me nem jervae   nharesoon  rakharo say you should take ear   to teach respect  please please dont hurt him  tell him i dont want my brother harmed  khaleesi vos zalo meme nem azisa  huh   shafki  mormont kill these dothraki dogs  i am your king  shall we return to the khalasar khaleesi  uh uh uh uh uh  you walk  i wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time   im leaving this morning  youre leaving  im the first ranger  my job is out there   there have been disturbing reports  what kind of reports  the kind i dont want to believe  im ready i wont let you down  youre not going  youre no ranger jon   but im better than every  better than no one  here  a man gets what he earns  when he earns it  well speak when i return   a bears balls  oh youre joking  and his brains and his guts his lungs and his heart  all fried in his own fat  when youre a hundred miles north of the wall  and you ate your last meal a week ago you leave nothing for the wolves  and how do a bears balls taste  a bit chewy  and what about you my lord whats the strangest thing youve eaten  do dornish girls count  so you roam the seven kingdoms  collaring pickpockets and horse thieves  and bringing them here as eager recruits  aye  but its not all of ems done bad things  some of ems just poor lads looking for steady feed  some of ems highborn lads looking for glory  they have a better chance finding feed than glory  the nights watch is a joke to you is it  is that what we are lannister  an army of jesters in black  you dont have enough men to be an army  and aside from yoren here none of you are particularly funny  i hope weve provided you with some good stories to tell  when youre back in kings landing  but something to think about  while youre drinking your wine down there  enjoying your brothels  half the boys youve seen training will die north of the wall  might be a wildings axe that gets them  might be sickness  might just be the cold  they die in pain  and they do it so plump little lords like you  can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort  do you think im plump  listen benjen may i call you benjen  call me what you like  im not sure what ive done to offend you  i have great admiration for the nights watch  ive great admiration for you as first ranger  you know my brother once told me  that nothing someone says before the word but  really counts  but  i dont believe that giants and ghouls and white walkers  are lurking beyond the wall  i believe that the only difference  between us and the wildlings is that  when the wall went up our ancestors happened  to live on the right side of it  youre right  the wildlings are no different from us  a little rougher maybe  but theyre made of meat and bone  i know how to track them and i know how to kill them  its not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights  youve never been north of the wall  so dont tell me whats out there  are you going below   keep well keep warm  enjoy the capital brother  oh i always do  i think hes starting to like me   going below  aye  into the tunnel  and out the other side  hell be north of the wall for a month or two  so youre heading down to kings landing too  aye day after tomorrow  i get about half of my recruits from their dungeons  lets share the road i could use some decent company  i i travel a bit on the grubby side my lord  not this time well be staying at the finest castles and inns  no one turns away a lannister  at jakar  athjahakar  ath ja haker  athjahakar  athjahakar  yes khaleesi  oh what are you doing  when was last time you bleed khaleesi  you change khaleesi  for a man on horseback the curved blade  is a good thing easier to handle  its a good weapon for a dothrakan  but a man in full plate  shori tawakof  the arakh wont get through the steel  thats where the broadsword has the advantage  designed for piercing plate   armor  armor  armor make a man   vroz  slow   slow  its true  but it also keeps a man alive  he still is  a man of great honor  and i betrayed him  i dont think she wants to eat dog  the khaleesi have baby inside her  it is true she does not bleed for two moons  her belly start to swell   she does not want to eat horse  ill have the boys butcher a goat for supper  i need to ride to qohor  uh we ride for vaes dothrak  dont worry ill catch you  the hordes easy to find  dont stand so still  its harder to hit a moving target  except for you you move too much  i could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me  how many winters have you seen lord tyrion  eight no nine  all of them brief  they say the winter of my birth was three years long maester aemon  this summer has lasted nine  but reports from the citadel tell us the days grow shorter  the starks are always right eventually  winter is coming  this one will be long  and dark things will come with it  weve been capturing wildlings  more every month theyre fleeing south  the ones who flee say theyve seen the white walkers  yes and the fishermen of lannisport say they see mermaids  one of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions  he swore it right up to the moment  ned stark chopped his head off  the nights watch is the only thing  standing between the realm  and what lies beyond  and it has has become an army  of undisciplined boys and tired old men  there are less than a thousand of us now  we cant man the other castles on the wall  we cant properly patrol the wilderness  weve barely enough resources to keep our lads armed   and fed  your sister  sits by the side the king  tell her we need help  when winter does come  gods help us all if were not ready  im sorry to see you leave lannister  its either me or this cold  and it doesnt appear to be going anywhere  will you stop at winterfell on your way south  i expect i will  gods know there arent many feather beds  between here and kings landing  if you see my brother bran  tell him i miss him  tell him id visit if i could  of course  hell never walk again  if youre going to be a cripple  its better to be a rich cripple  you take care snow  farewell my lord  you are late boy  tomorrow you will be here at midday  who are you  your dancing master  syrio forel  tomorrow you will catch it  now pick it up  that is not the way boy  this is not a greatsword that is needing two hands to swing it   its too heavy  it is heavy as it needs to be  to make you strong  just so  one hand is all that is needed  now you are standing all wrong  turn your body sideface  yes  so  you are skinny that is good  the target is smaller  now the grip let me see  yes  the grip must be delicate  what if i drop it  the steel must be part of your arm  can you drop part of your arm no  nine years syrio forel was first sword to the sealord of braavos  he knows these things you must listen to me boy  im a girl  boy girl you are a sword  that is all  that is the grip  you are not holding a battleaxe   you are holding  a needle  ahhh  just so  now we will begin the dance  remember child  this is not the dance of the westeros we are learning  the knights dance  hacking and hammering  this is the bravos dance  the water dance  it is swift  and sudden  all men are made of water  do you know this  if you pierce them  the water leaks out and they die  now you will try to strike me  ha  up  ha  ah  dead  oh  dead   hup  very dead  come  ah ah ah   hup  again faster  ah
