made of valyrian steel  only one maester in 100 wears it on his chain  it signifies that i have studied the higher mysteries  and all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells  i was no different  i was young  and what boy doesnt secretly wish for hidden powers  to lift him out of his dull life into a special one  but in the end for all my efforts  i got no more out of it than 1000 boys before me   chuckles  come on  all right  maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world  but not anymore  the dragons are gone  the giants are dead  and the children of the forest forgotten

your son marched against tywin lannister yet  i do not sit on my sons war councils  and if i did i would not share his strategies with you  if robb stark wants a pact with us he should come himself

back  while hes tangling with the lion in the westerlands  the north is ripe for the taking  the ironborn will reave and pillage as it was in the old days  all along the northern coast  well spread our dominion across the green lands  securing the neck and everything above  every stronghold will yield to us one by one  winterfell may defy us for a year but what of it  the rest shall be ours  forest field and hall  yara my daughter youll take 30 longships  to attack deepwood motte  ive always wanted a castle  and whats my role in all this  youll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the stoney shore  a ship  you give her 30 and i get one  the sea bitch we thought shed be perfect for you  im to fight fishermen  be careful of their nets  father i fought with robb stark i know his men  he wont give up the north so easily  they wont even know were there until its too late  what do you know of it woman  im a proven warrior  your brothers were warriors both of them dead  at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect  im not protecting anyone  i just wonder if its not wiser to wait  why risk going against the north if they would be our allies  rise up against them and they could destroy us  but if we pledge fealty to them  theyll give us casterly rock  what are our words  our words   we do not sow  we do not sow  we are ironborn  were not subjects were not slaves  we do not plow the fields or toil in the mine  we take what is ours  your time with the wolves has made you weak  you act as if i volunteered to go  you gave me away if you remember  the day you bent the knee to robert baratheon  after he crushed you  did you take what was yours then  you gave me away  your boy  your last boy  you gave me away like i was some dog you didnt want anymore  and now you curse me because ive come home  youd have our father bow down to your other family  i have no other family  dont you  make your choice theon and do it quickly  our ships sail with or without you  you wont let me leave this room   you wont let me  shh shh keep your voice down  why you think your father can hear me  hes 300 miles away   sighs   i dont intend for you to stay here  i might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens  again only temporary  every man who has tasted my cooking  has told me what a good whore i am  but you wouldnt be a cook  youd pose as a scullion  scullion what is a scullion  kitchen wench   a kitchen wench  yes but  cleaning pots  is that how my lion wants to see me  your lion wants to see you alive  weve come to a dangerous place  my sister wants to hurt me  shell look for any weakness she can find  she cant know about you  im the weakness  its a compliment my lady  how is being a weakness a compliment  language can be a bit tricky here  oh im too stupid to understand  the stupid foreign girl  i am not a kitchen wench  when will joffrey and sansa be married  soon darling when the war is over  mother says ill have a new gown for the ceremony  and another for the feast  but yours will be ivory since youre the bride  the princess just spoke to you  pardon your grace  im sure your dress will be beautiful myrcella  im counting the days until the fighting is done  and i can pledge my love to the king in sight of the gods  is joffrey going to kill sansas brother  he might  would you like that  no i dont think so  even if he does sansa will do her duty  wont you little dove    knocking    gasps  come in   door opens   who are you  im shae my lady your new handmaiden  i didnt know i needed a new handmaiden   youre not from here  no  what are you doing  waiting for you to tell me what to do  i shouldnt have to tell you to do things  you should just do them  what things  change my linens wash my clothing  scrub the floor empty my chamber pot brush my hair   no  you said to brush  not now  your chamber pot is empty  clean the table  have you ever been a handmaiden before   yes  for whom   lady zuriff  lady zuriff  lady zuriff  there is no lady zuriff in this city  she wasnt in this city  well i dont know how they did things in that city  but in this city handmaidens wait on ladies  not the other way around  and i dont have time to answer 1000 questions  and teach you how to do your job  do you want me to leave  just brush my hair  oh thank the gods  i havent had a proper shit in six days  ive encountered this problem before my lord  the stresses of power often have this  insalubrious effect  two drops with water daily  right im so grateful to have a man  of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side   please  thank you my lord  i can trust you pycelle can i not  why yes of course my lord  these are perilous times  and the crown must forge new alliances  and these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony  matrimony huh  yes  im trusting the council with these plans  but the queen mustnt know  we cant have her meddling in affairs  that could determine the future of the realm  theres too much at stake  oh yes yes indeed yes  i shall be silent as the grave  im brokering an alliance with house martell of dorne  princess myrcella will wed their youngest son  when she comes of age ensuring their loyalty  and their army should we need it  myrcella sent away to dorne  but remember the queen mustnt know  ooh the queen mustnt know  i love conversations that begin this way  i plan to marry princess myrcella off  to theon greyjoy  theon greyjoy  forgive me my lord  he grew up a ward of winterfell  he fights for robb stark  precisely theons father loathes the starks  and will convince the boy to come to our side  greyjoy can destroy the northern army from within  and we can have his fathers ships  but remember you must tell no one  tell no one what  i plan to wed princess myrcella to robin arryn of the vale  lysa is not fond of me  but perhaps the promise of a royal match  will convince her to let bygones be bygones  she imprisoned you  she tried to execute you  and you offer her son a princess  for men in our position holding grudges can be  an encumbrance dont you think  and i suppose you want me to broker this agreement  who better  yes i could sing this song to lysa  if i cared to  whats in it for me  the gratitude of the people of westeros  for helping to end this war  the adoration of the king for bringing the vale back into the fold  and harrenhal  harrenhal is cursed  never took you for a superstitious man  by all means tear it down and rebuild  youll be able to afford it  i plan to make you lord of the riverlands  with a single stroke youd make me one of the  greatest lords in the realm  you served my family well in the matter of the succession  so did janos slynt and he was given harrenhal too  until you snatched it away  i need you to deliver lysa arryn  i didnt need janos slynt  its settled then  good  oh and remember  the queen mustnt know   breathing heavily   that must hurt   groans   what  what is it   scoffs   a member of the kingsguard  as if i wasnt humiliated enough already   sighs   brienne is a very capable warrior  and shes devoted to me  youre jealous  jealous  of brienne the beauty  dont make me laugh   ill make it up to you  no your grace  not tonight  theres another tyrell who requires your attention  you didnt win my fathers support  or his army on charm alone  your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back  brides arent usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night  and margaerys a virgin  officially  shall i bring her to you  i should warn you  ive had quite a bit of wine  as is your right you are a king  you look very beautiful  thank you your grace   its a lovely gown  you think so  i cant decide how i like it better  this way  or this way  you certainly dont need it  although  some say that beauty most desired  is the beauty concealed  must be the wine  here let me   shudders   im sorry  do you want my brother to come in and help   what  he could get you started  i know he wouldnt mind  or i can turn over and you can pretend im him  i dont know what youre talking about  theres no need for us to play games  save your lies for court youre going to need a lot of them  your enemies arent happy about us  they want to tear us apart  and the best way to stop them  is to put your baby  in my belly  we can try again later  you decide how you want to do it  with me with me and loras  however else you like  whatever you need to do  you are a king  cersei you monster  myrcella is my only daughter  do you really think ill let you sell her like a common whore  myrcellas a princess  some would say she was born for this  i will not let you ship her off to dorne  as i was shipped off to robert baratheon  dorne is the safest place or her  are you mad the martells loathe us  thats why we need to seduce them  were going to need their support in the war  your son started   shell be a hostage  a guest  you wont get away with this  you think the piece of paper father gave you keeps you safe  ned stark had a piece of paper too   its done cersei  no   you cannot stop it  no  just how safe do you think myrcella is if this city falls  do you want to see her raped butchered like the targaryen children  make no mistake  theyll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours  get out get out  theon of the house greyjoy  you would this day consecrate your faith to the drowned god   i would  kneel  let theon your servant  be born again from the sea as you were  bless him with salt  bless him with stone  bless him with steel  what is dead may never die  what is dead may never die  but rises again harder and stronger  stand   dog barking    footsteps approaching   i dont appreciate being made a fool of dwarf  if myrcella marries the martell boy  she cant very well marry robin arryn can she  no afraid not sorry about that  and harrenhal  i suppose thats off the table as well  yes i fear so sorry about that too  leave me out of your next deception  oh thats a shame  you were to be the centerpiece of my next deception  my brother jaime rots in a northern stockade  i would see him released  thats where you come in  robb stark will never release the kingslayer  no he wont but his mother might  how would you like to see your beloved cat again   footsteps approaching    find him  oh aye  and he has company  filthy old stoat almost hate to interrupt   no you dont  no i dont    door bursts    gasps   what is the meaning of this  no please please  you disappoint me grand maester  i am your loyal servant  so loyal that you told the queen about my plans  to send myrcella to dorne  no never  its a falsehood i swear it  it wasnt me  ah varys  it was varys the spider  see i told varys that i was giving the princess to the greyjoys  i told littlefinger that i planned to wed her to robin arryn  i told no one that i was offering her to the dornish  no one but you  the eunuch has spies everywhere  cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats   no no no  there are no goats halfman  well make do   whimpering   how long have you been spying for my sister  all i did i did for house lannister  always your lord father ask him  ive always been his servant  since the days of the mad king   i dont like his beard  what  what oh no no   whimpering   how many hands have you betrayed pycelle  eddard stark jon arryn  lord arryn he knew   stammering  he knew the truth about the queen  and well he planned to act  to tell king robert  so you poisoned him  no never  but you let him die made sure he succumbed  lannister i always served lannister  get him out of my sight throw him in one of the black cells  oh no no no no no please  dont you cant do this to me  for your trouble   pycelle shouting   youll be pleased to know our mutual friend  is doing quite well in lady sansas service  good one of my better ideas  and it seems the grand maester  has found his way into a black cell  well played my lord hand  but should i be worried  janos slynt pycelle  the small council grows smaller every day  the council has a reputation for serving past hands poorly  i dont mean to follow ned stark to the grave  power is a curious thing my lord  are you fond of riddles  why am i about to hear one  three great men sit in a room  a king a priest and a rich man  between them stands a common sellsword  each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two  who lives who dies  depends on the sellsword  does it he has neither crown  nor gold nor favor with the gods  he has a sword the power of life and death  but if its swordsmen who rule  why do we pretend kings hold all the power  when ned stark lost his head  who was truly responsible  joffrey the executioner  or something else  ive decided i dont like riddles  power resides where men believe it resides  its a trick  a shadow on the wall  and a very small man  can cast a very large shadow   crickets chirping    horse whinnies    snoring    door opens   you should be sleeping  tomorrows a long
