tywins castle from him  the lords of westeros will realize hes not invincible  take his home  take his gold take his power  why are you telling me  you begged me not to send theon  to negotiate with his father and i ignored your advice  now winterfell is burnt to the ground  the north is overrun with ironborn  and bran and rickon are gone  so casterly rock  im asking your advice  we have enough men  if walder frey cooperates  if walder frey cooperates  if reinforcements arrive from kings landing  before we take the castle  well be caught between tywins army and the sea  well lose the war and

light of the seven  we thank you for your hospitality my lord  i have come to make my apologies my lord  and to beg your forgiveness  dont beg my forgiveness your grace  it wasnt me you spurned it was

pledged to marry one of you and i broke that vow  the fault is not with you  any man would be lucky to have any one of you  i did what i did not to slight you  but because i loved another  i know these words cannot set right  the wrong i have done to you and your house  i beg your forgiveness  and pledge to do all i can to make amends  so the freys of the crossing and the starks of winterfell  may once again be friends  very good  there she is  come closer  let me have a look at you  still cant see you  old eyes  love  thats what the starks of winterfell call it eh  very honorable  i call it a pretty face  mmm very pretty  prettier than this lot thats for sure  very shapely as well  oh you try to hide her under that dress  if you wanted to hide her  you shouldnt have brought her here in the first place  i can always see  whats going on beneath a dress  been at this a long time  i bet when you take that dress off  everything stays right where it is  doesnt drop an inch  your king says he betrayed me for love  i say he betrayed me for firm tits  and a tight fit  and i can respect that  when i was your age id have broken 50 oaths  to get into that without a second thought  well ive enough room in the hall for you lot  well set up tents outside  with food and ale for the rest of your men  thank you my lord  well lets get ready  the wine will flow red  and the music will play loud  and well put this mess behind us  where  there  there its a back gate  my men use it when they visit yunkais bed slaves  your men but not you  i have no interest in slaves  a man cannot make love to property  this is where we enter the city  very few guards they know me  they let me inside  were not gonna sneak an army through a back gate  i kill the guards i take your two best men  and lead them through the back streets which i know well  and open the front gates  then comes the army  once the walls are breached the city will fall in hours  or perhaps youll lead grey worm and me to the slaughter  cutting the head off our army  the masters of yunkai will pay you your fee  and you wont have to split it three ways  cause youve already slaughtered your partners  you have a very suspicious mind  in my experience only dishonest people think this way  you command the unsullied  what do you think  _  _  _  you leave tonight  very good  well prepare  ser jorah  you can use an extra sword  youre the queensguard ser barristan  your place is by the queen  if we are truly her loyal servants  well do whatever needs to be done  no matter the cost no matter our pride  were west of castle black  but the nightforts closest to us  it was the first castle on the wall  the watch abandoned it during the reign of king jaehaerys i  too big impossible to maintain  other than castle black itself  the nightforts the perfect castle for us  its got a secret sally port  the black gate as old as the wall itself  no ones used it in centuries most likely  it leads through the wall  right down into the nightfort  if one knows how to find it  which it just so happens i do  how do you know all that  i read about it in a very old book  you know all that  from staring at marks on paper  yes  youre like a wizard  our father used to tell us  that no wildling ever looked upon the wall and lived  here we are  alive  remember what happens to children who run  im your father and ill do the talking  the roads have gone right to hell havent they  cracked three spokes this morning   need a hand  need about eight hands  oh  got to get this salt pork to the twins  in time for the wedding  many thanks  dont  dont kill him  dead rats dont squeak  youre so dangerous arent you  saying scary things to little girls  killing little boys and old people  a real hard man you are  more than anyone you know  youre wrong i know a killer   a real killer  that so  youd be like a kitten to him  hed kill you with his little finger  that him   no  good  dont kill him  please  please dont  youre very kind  someday itll get you killed  where are we  the gift i think  brandon the builder gave all this land  south of the wall to the nights watch  for their sustenance and support  maester luwin taught me that  doesnt seem to be supporting anyone at the moment  its good land and theres no war up here  why leave  wildlings  sorry  but they come over the wall and raid  steal carry off women  old nan said they turn your skull into a cup  and make you drink your own blood from it  thats what old nan said  theres a storm coming  i dont see any  its as good a place to shelter as any  we can drink some blood while we wait  i dont need much  only one old man and eight good horses  whats one old man doing with eight horses  he breeds them for the watch  hows he keep folks from stealing them  the watch protects him  not today they dont  hes selling horses hes got some gold in there   and proper steel  lets carve him up  we just take the horses and go  the old mans no threat  i keep telling you  hes an old man  a spear through the hearts a better way to die  than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear  the watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief  theyll send a lot more to hunt down murderers  i hope so  killing crows in their castle is tough  killing them out here in the open  thats what we do  spread out  surround the hut and move in  ygritte  clear the barn  no ones going to believe youre a hog farmer if you eat them all  best part of the animal  dont worry theyre still there  i know theyre still there  you check every five minutes  like youre afraid theyre gonna move  im not afraid  of course you are  youre almost there  and youre afraid you wont make it  the closer you get the worse the fear gets  no point in trying to hide behind that face  i know fear when i see it  seen it a lot  i knew fear when i saw it in you  youre afraid of fire  when berics sword went up in flames  you looked like a scared little girl  and i know why too  i heard what your brother did to you  pressed your face to the fire  like youre a nice juicy mutton chop  that give you some ideas  might do  go ahead then  you might get away  might even make it there on your own  theyre just over the river  the closest youve been to family  since ilyn payne snipped your daddys neck  someday im gonna put a sword through your eye  and out the back of your skull  how are we going to get past the wall  my uncle said its 700 feet high  how did you get past it  got in a boat and rowed past the bay of seals  it would take us two months to get to the bay of seals  some climb straight up the ice  even hodors not strong enough to climb the wall with me on his back  hodor    only three are still manned  hodor  one of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through  my uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone  when the castles were deserted  well well have to open them up again   whoa whoa whoa  theres a rider out there  just one   theres more  hodor  shh shh   its just thunder sweet giant  hodor  i yield   i yield  wildlings  wheres shaggydog and summer  hunting  hodor   shh quiet hodor  hodor  make him shut up if they hear us   hush hodor no no more hodoring  hodor   hodor  hodor calm down   you need to keep quiet  theyre gonna hear us  hodor be quiet   ah hodor  hodor calm down   hodor hodor  hodor be quiet  what did you do  nothing  i dont know  whats that  thats a horse dying  bring them over here  that was the last of them the rest are dead  i heard shouting up there  thunder  i know the difference between shouting and thunder  maybe its ghosts  that wont help you grandpa  where you riding  doesnt matter now does it  no it doesnt matter now  cut his throat or hell tell the crows were here  you understand  let me stand at least  let me go with a bit of dignity  make the crow kill him  youre one of us now prove it  the wolves are out there  i cant do it by choice  i dont know how it happens in my dreams  youre a warg bran  its in your blood  i cant  you just did with him  a wolf is nothing compared to that  she looks sharp  do it  do it  i told you hes still one of them  go on boy  go on  hes a crow  hell always be a crow  and heres his crow wife guarding him  hell stab us in the back first chance he gets  kill him   hes one of them  no  do you hear me  youre not gonna die for one of them  do it  theyll find us if you dont  you were right the whole time  hyah  when you hear a songbirds whistle you come  im a great whistler the greatest in the land  daario naharis  that one was quick   there may be others  i doubt it  the yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them  thats what you call a few guards  come on what do you got huh  lord edmure  i hope im not a disappointment to you  youre a delight to me my lady  you may now cloak the bride  and bring her under your protection  in the sight of the seven  i hereby seal these two souls  binding them as one for eternity  look upon each other and say the words  father smith  warrior mother  maiden crone stranger   i am hers  i am his   and she is mine  and he is mine  from this day until the end of my days   is that safe  theyre long gone  you were right  i can get inside summers mind whenever i want  of course you can  north of the wall there are wildlings  who can control all sorts of animals  but you did a lot more than that  you got inside hodors mind  they cant do that north of the wall  no one can do that  anywhere  when i was looking through summers eyes   i saw jon  where  he was with the wildlings  they tried to kill him but he got away  hell be heading back to castle black then  thats where we should go  for all we know castle blacks already under attack   if this many wildlings got through  i already told you  im not going north of the wall  everything jojen told me is true  you saw what i did to hodor  i have to find the threeeyed raven  listen to me little lord  dont worry  im not asking you to come with me  it wont be safe for rickon  me im coming with you  no  you and osha and shaggydog head for the last hearth  the umbers are our bannermen theyll protect you  im coming with you  im your brother  i have to protect you  right now i have to protect you  robbs at war and im going beyond the wall  if something happens to us  youre the heir to winterfell  would you know how to find the last hearth  you southerners build your big castles and you never move  youre easy to find  were not southerners  and i dont want to leave you  shh shh come here little soldier  you and me were gonna have some adventures  you dont have to do any of this  your family took me in  and was good to me when they had no cause to be  shh  well be fine you and me  the umbers are great warriors  even i heard about them growing up  theyll teach you how to swing a sword  i know how to swing a sword  youre leaving now its the middle of the night  i learned to walk in darkness  say your goodbyes little man  keep this one safe  he means the world to me  weve been waiting a long time  havent we  i dont know you tell me  how long does it take to sack a city  it was just as you said  they did not believe until it was too late  their slave soldiers  threw down their spears and surrendered  and daario naharis  the city is yours my queen  theyre good arent they  they ought to be because they cost enough  look at the crowd there  he complained about this marriage  the entire ride from riverrun  and now look at him  the gods love to reward a fool   uncle  what  hes my nephew i love him  and hes a damned fool  dont you drink lord bolton  never do my lady dulls the senses  thats the point  didnt you marry one of these frey girls  aye  lord walder let me choose any of his granddaughters  and promised me the girls weight in silver as a dowry  so i have a fat young bride  i hope she makes you very happy  well shes made me very rich  pardon my lord my lady  i need to find a tree to piss on  my mothers alone with roose bolton  i should rescue her  your mother is less in need of rescue  than any woman ive ever met  be kind  shes finally starting to like you  and i like her  but if she had her way i would be back in volantis  playing my harp and you would be sitting over there  eating blackberries out of roslin freys hand  perhaps ive made a terrible mistake  striking your king is an act of treason  no dont  dont insult them  your grace  the septon has prayed his prayers  some words were said  and lord edmure  has wrapped my daughter in a cloak  but they are not yet man and wife  a sword needs a sheath  and a wedding needs a bedding  what does my sire say  to bed to bed to bed  if you think the time is right lord walder  by all means let us bed them  to bed to bed to bed  go on  oh careful now ladies  once you set that monster free  theres no caging him again  to bed to bed to bed  poor girl  every bride suffers the same  im sure you endured yours with grace  oh ned forbade it  he said it wouldnt be right if he broke a mans jaw on our wedding night  that is a very strange custom  i suppose it does seem strange  from a foreigners perspective  it seems normal to you  its a tradition  without the bedding ceremony theres no real proof  the lord and lady consummated their marriage  but there are other ways of providing proof  boy or girl  i dont know  but if its a boy i know what we should name him  oh do you  it seems to me the father should have some say in his sons naming  eddard  dont you want to teach little ned stark  how to ride horses  i do  go on line em up  whoa whoa whoa whoa  where are you going  got salt pork for the feast  the feast is over  doesnt sound like its over  if i tell you its over its over  turn this cart around and get the hell out of here  got pigs feet too  are you soft in the head  turn this cart around  your grace  i feel ive been remiss  in my duties  ive given you meat and wine and music  but i havent shown you  the hospitality you deserve  my king has married  and i owe my new queen a wedding gift  robb  you ready to head home to winterfell right  feast over yet is it  aye its over  follow him  aim  its too late  the king in the north arises  lord walder  lord walder enough  let it end  please  he is my son  my first son  let him go and i swear that we will forget this  i swear it by the old gods and new  we will take no vengeance  you already swore me one oath right here in my castle  you swore by all the gods your son would marry my daughter  take me for a hostage but let robb go  robb get up  get up and walk out  please  please  and why would i let him do that  on my honor as a tully  on my honor as a stark  let him go  or i will cut your wifes throat  ill find another  mother  the lannisters send their regards
