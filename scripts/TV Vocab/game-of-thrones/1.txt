them but  i saw what i saw  i saw the white walkers  people need to know  if you can get word to my family  tell them im no coward  tell them im sorry  forgive me lord  in the name of robert of the house baratheon   the first of his name  dont look away  king of the andals and the first men  father will know if you do  lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm  i eddard of the house stark  lord of winterfell and warden of the north  sentence you to die  you did well  you understand why i did it  jon said he was a deserter  but do you understand why i had to kill him  our way is the old way  the man who passes the sentence  should swing the sword  is it true he saw the white walkers  the white walkers have been gone for thousands of years  so he was lying  a madman sees what he sees  what is it  mountain lion  there are no mountain lions in these woods  its a freak  its a direwolf  tough old beast  there are no direwolves south of the wall  now there are five  you want to hold it  where will they go  their mothers dead  they dont belong down here  better a quick death  they wont last without their mother   right give it here  no  put away your blade  i take orders from your father not you   please father  im sorry bran  lord stark  there are five pups  one for each of the stark children  the direwolf is the sigil of your house  they were meant to have them  you will train them yourselves  you will feed them yourselves  and if they die you will bury them yourselves  what about you  im not a stark  get on  what is it  the runt of the litter that ones yours snow  as your brother i feel its my duty to warn you  you worry too much   its starting to show  and you never worry about anything  when we were seven and you jumped off the cliffs at casterly rock   and you were never afraid  there was nothing to be afraid of until you told father  were lannisters  lannisters dont act like fools  what if jon arryn told someone  but who would he tell   my husband  if he told the king both our heads  would be skewered on the city gates by now  whatever jon arryn knew or didnt know it died with him  and robert will choose a new hand of the king someone to do his job  while hes off fucking boars and hunting whores  or is it the other way around  and life will go on  you should be the hand of the king  thats an honor i can do without  their days are too long  their lives are too short  all these years  and i still feel like an outsider  when i come here  you have five northern children  youre not an outsider  i wonder if the old gods agree  its your gods with all the rules  i am so sorry my love   tell me  there was a raven from kings landing  jon arryn is dead  a fever took him  i know he was like a father to you   your sister the boy  they both have

would be good to have you on the field  the competition has become a bit stale   i dont fight in tournaments  no  getting a little old for it  i dont fight in tournaments  because when i fight a man
