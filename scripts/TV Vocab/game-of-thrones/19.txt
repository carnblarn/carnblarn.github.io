our order does not deal in pig shit  king stannis is my god he raised me up  and gave you a future i could never have imagined  and you think a fire god commanded all that   it was stannis  stannis is my king but hes only a man  dont tell him that  does it give you joy to scare people  no it gives me joy to kill people  killings the sweetest thing there is  you shipped off my only daughter and now you want  to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die  he needs to be out there  the men will fight more fiercely seeing their king  fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mothers skirts  stannis two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep  scouts assure us robb stark wont risk  marching on casterly rock until hes at full force  hell risk anything at any time  well ride at nightfall  the stark forces are distracted now is the time to strike  my dear nephew you do understand stannis  baratheon sails this way  they say stannis never smiles ill give him a red smile  if the wind holds well reach kings landing in a day  will it hold  cant make promises for the wind your grace  stannis knows kings landing  he knows where the walls are strongest  and he knows which gates are weakest  mud gate thats where hell land  and if stannis does attack the mud gate what do we have   theme music playing   game of thrones 2x09  blackwater original air date on may 27 2012

fleets at the moment  not after tonight when the sun rises  stannis will sit on the iron throne  and you will be his hand   gods be good  god  father there is only one and he watches over us   but not over them  over all of us  the people of kings landing did not choose the false king  joffrey baratheon  they will be glad to see his head on a spike  well first we have to put it there  our ships outnumber theirs 10 to one  our army outnumber theirs five to one  those walls have never been breached  and the men guarding the walls  when they see you they dont see a liberator  they see a stranger come to set their city on fire  i have faith in the lord of light  i have faith in our cause  and i have faith in my captain   thunder crashes   are you afraid my lion  if the city falls stannis will burn every lannister he can find  of course im afraid  i wont let them hurt you  im a lannister  i dont have a choice in all this  but its not your war  it is now  you cant fuck your way out of everything  i have so far  do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent  that i should make love to you like it was your  last day on this earth  pycelle as you know your grace  it is not only the sworn duty of a maester  to carry out the wishes of the house he serves  but also to offer guidance  and counsel in times of war  your words are always wise and measured   if you could  if anything  a maesters duties become more urgent  in times of war and turmoil  i remember back in the days of king  you brought me something  yes  essence of nightshade  is as dangerous as it is efficacious  a single drop in a cup of wine  suffices to soothe ragged nerves  three drops will bring on a deep  and dreamless sleep  10 drops however  i know what 10 drops will bring   your grace if i may ask  you may not  you must have a lot of work to do  im sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon  yes a siege is very  be careful on the stairs grand maester there are so many   sighs  your grace   men singing  and so he spoke   that lord of castamere   but now the rains   weep oer his halls   with no one there to hear   yes now the rains   weep oer his halls   and not a soul to hear    to the boys  lannisters  whered you learn the lannister song   drunk lannisters   men laugh   youve got a pretty voice  thank you very much  and i like your nose  how many times you break it

 aye  slaps   i expect he will someday    bell tolling   man here we are   chatter   one more drink before the war  shall we  ive always hated the bells  they ring for horror  a dead king a city under siege   a wedding  exactly  podrick is that it  is that it nice touch  as if you dont know the name of every boy in town  im not entirely sure what youre suggesting  im entirely sure youre entirely sure what im suggesting  do you trust him  oddly enough i do  good  the map you asked for  there must be 20 miles of tunnels beneath the city  closer to 50  the targaryens built this city to withstand a siege  and to provide escape if necessary  im not escaping  strange as it sounds im the captain of the ship  and if the ship goes down i go with her  that is good to hear  though im sure many captains say the same  while their ship is afloat  you look well suited for battle my lord  well im not  for all our sakes i hope you are wrong  my little birds tell me that stannis baratheon  has taken up with a red priestess from asshai  what of it  you dont believe in the old powers my lord  blood spells curses shapeshifting what do you think  i think you believe in what you see  and in what those you trust have seen  you probably dont entirely trust me  mm dont take it personally  i dont entirely trust myself  and yet i have seen things  and heard things  things you have not things i wish i had not  i dont believe ive ever told you how i was cut  no i dont believe you have  one day i will  the dark arts have provided lord stannis with his armies  and paved his path to our door  for a man in service to such powers to sit on the iron throne  i can think of nothing worse  and tonight  i believe you are the only man who can stop him   tolling continues   theyre welcoming the new

battle plans with stupid girls  im sorry your grace youre right im stupid  of course youll be in the vanguard  they say my brother robb always goes  where the fighting is thickest  and he is only a pretender  your brothers turn will come  then you can lick his blood off hearteater too  some of those boys will never come back  joffrey will  the worst ones always live  shh come my lady   men

 no signal no plan  no plan and stannis baratheon sacks this city  takes the iron throne puts your pinched  little head atop a gate somewhere  it might be quite amusing  except that my head would be

what you had for breakfast three days ago  there are no surprises here  if its true there is dissension in their ranks  maybe their sailors have mutinied  maybe   babies crying   i dont know why she wants me here  shes always saying how stupid i am she hates me  maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else  i doubt it  maybe shes jealous of you  why would she be jealous  sansa  i was wondering where our little dove had flown  you look pale child  is your red flower still blooming  yes  fitting isnt it  the men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here  pour lady sansa some

the battles first traitors  have ser ilyn see to them  put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning  the only way to keep the small folk loyal  is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy  remember that if you ever hope to become a queen   door closes   you said he was here to protect us  he is  traitors are a danger to us all  more wine    distant drums beating    men shouting   there they are   archers to their marks  archers to your marks  man archers  nock your arrows  man nock arrows   hold fast  man hold fast  what are you doing we need to attack them

courage inspired them  lifted their spirits  and if the city should fall  youd like that wouldnt you  the red keep should hold for a time  long enough for me to go to the walls  and yield to lord stannis in person  if it were anyone else outside those gates  i might have hoped for a private audience  but this is stannis baratheon  id have a better chance of seducing his horse  have i shocked
