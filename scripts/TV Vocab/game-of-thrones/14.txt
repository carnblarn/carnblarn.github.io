oozing out of your mouth  i dont want you in my tent one minute more than necessary  so tell me why are you here  renly you can trust brienne  her loyalty comes without charge  you still have many friends at court your grace  many who believe ned stark erred  by not supporting your claim  now i understand  you know i have the numbers  you know im marching on kings landing  when i take the throne you hope to retain your position  and your head  i would give priority to my head  i understand that you dont like me  and while that saddens me greatly  i did not come here today seeking your affection  when you march on kings landing  you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or  open gates  your grace  lord baelish  all of these tents look the same to me   would you be so kind  it would be my pleasure  it took me weeks to learn way around the camp  twice i walked in on officers in stages of undress  and the moment i learn which tent is mine  were on the move again  your tent  not our tent  the king snores perhaps  or simply prefers solitude  pressures of command no doubt  four kings vying for the throne  i am not tutored in warfare  but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers  if war were arithmetic  the mathematicians would rule the world  but i did notice your brother entering his graces tent the just now  the place of a kingsguard is by the kings side  and on the night of the your wedding  who was by the kings side then  you seem quite interested in our marriage  your marriage is quite interesting  not only to me but to the realm  the marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest  if nothing else  youve never married have you  ive been unlucky in my affections sadly  that is sad  though perhaps its for the best  the whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you  so allow me to explain  my husband is my king and my king is my husband  here is your tent lord baelish good night   hoofbeats    horse whinnies    speaking dothraki   what do you know of this place  only that the desert around their walls  is called the garden of nes  every time the qartheen shut their gates on a traveler  the garden grows    man

seize the moment  i trusted you my husband trusted you  and you repaid our faith with treachery   no my lady  get out  cat ive  ive loved you since i was a boy  it seems to me that fate has given us this chance  have you lost your mind get out  do you want to see your girls again  sansa more beautiful than ever  and arya just as wild as ever  you have arya too  both girls are healthy and safe  for now  but you know the queen and you know joffrey  i fear for their longevity  if they remain in the capital   knife clinks   what do you want  the lannisters will trade your daughters for the kingslayer  of course they will  jaime lannister for two girls  robb will never agree to those terms  im not bringing these terms to him  im bringing them to you  you think id keep secrets from my son  robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle  but hes not a mother  consider it cat  you may not get another chance   ive brought you a gift  i dont want your gifts  a token of tyrion lannisters goodwill  he wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners  is offered in good faith  good faith  whats this  your husband was an honorable man  he should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath winterfell   you may not believe  get out   groans     men shouting   man get up you dogs   wood banging   thats him the one who picks  the mountain  what are you doing  he told me he stares at him every day  thats why he doesnt get picked  you  man move boy  move   liquid trickling   tickler is there gold and silver in the village   i dont know  gems  i didnt see any   where

find you in the stormlands  i had not thought to be here lord stannis   can that truly be you  who else might it be  when i saw your standard i couldnt be sure   whose banner is that  my own  i suppose if we used the same one  the battle would be terribly confusing  why is your stag on fire  the king has taken for his sigil  the fiery heart of the lord of light  ah you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about  mm brother  now i understand why you found religion in your old age  watch yourself renly  renly no no im relieved  i never really believed youre a fanatic  charmless rigid a bore yes  but not a godly man  you should kneel hes the lords chosen  born amidst salt and smoke  born amidst salt and smoke  is he a ham  stannis thats twice ive warned you  listen to yourselves  if you were sons of mine i would knock your heads together  and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered  that you were brothers  it is strange to find you beside my brother lady stark  your husband was a supporter of my claim  lord eddards integrity cost him his head  and you sit beside this pretender and chastise me  we share a common enemy  the iron throne is mine by right  all those that deny that are my foes  the whole realm denies it from dorne to the wall  old men deny it with their death rattle  and unborn children deny it in their mothers wombs  no one wants you for their king  you never wanted any friends brother  but a man without friends is a man without power  for the sake of the mother who bore us  i will give you this one night to reconsider  strike your banners  come to me before dawn  and i will grant you your old seat in the council  ill even name you my heir  until a son is born to me  otherwise i shall destroy you  look across those fields brother  can you see all those banners  you think a few bolts of cloth will make you king  no  the men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king  we shall see renly  come the dawn we shall see  look to your sins lord renly  the night is dark and full of terrors  would you believe i loved him once  i thought we were welcome  if you heard a dothraki horde was approaching your city  you might do the same khaleesi  horde  my name is daenerys  daenerys stormborn of the house targaryen  you know me my lord  only by reputation khaleesi  and im no lord merely a humble merchant  they call you the mother of dragons  and what should i call you  oh my name is quite long  and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce  i am simply a trader of spices  but we are the thirteen  charged with the governance and protection of qarth  the greatest city that ever was or will be  the beauty of quarth is legendary  qarth  qarth  might we see the dragons  my friend  we have travelled very far  we have no food no water  once i see my people fed i would be honored  forgive me mother of dragons  but no man alive has seen a living dragon  some of my more skeptical friends  refuse to believe your children  even exist  all we ask is the chance to see for ourselves  i am not a liar  oh i dont think you are  but as ive never met you before  my opinion on the matter is of limited value  where i come from  guests are treated with respect  not insulted at the gates  then perhaps you should return to where you come from  we wish you well  what are you doing  you promised to receive me  we have received you  here we are and here you are  if you do not let us in all of us will die  which we shall deeply regret  but qarth did not become  the greatest city that ever was or will be  by letting dothraki savages through its gates  khaleesi please be careful  thirteen  when my dragons are grown  we will take back what was stolen from me  and destroy those who have wronged me  we will lay waste to armies  and burn cities to the ground  turn us away and we will burn you first  ah  you are a true targaryen  only as you said a moment ago  retreating in fear from a little girl  is unbecoming of the greatest city  that ever was or will be  the discussion is over xaro xhoan daxos  the thirteen have spoken  i am one of the thirteen  and i am still speaking  the girl threatens to burn our city to the ground  and you would invite her in for a cup of wine  she is the mother of dragons  do you expect her to watch her people starve  without breathing fire  i believe we can allow a few dothraki  through our gates without dooming our city  after all here i am  a savage from the summer isles  and qarth still stands  our decision is final  very well  i invoke soumai  i will vouch for her her people  and her dragons in accordance with the law  be it on your head  welcome to qarth my lady  mountain you  tickler is there gold or silver in the village   im not from the village  where is the brotherhood  i dont know what that is   squeaking    horses neigh   man you two take lord lannisters things to his quarters  whats this  we werent expecting you till tomorrow lord tywin   chuckles  evidently not  why are these prisoners not in their cells  mountain cells are overflowing my lord  polliver this lot wont be here long  dont need no permanent place  after we interrogate em we usually

lungs out boy  hell do no such thing  this ones a girl you idiot  dressed as a boy   why  safer to travel my lord  smart  more than i can say for this lot  get these prisoners to work  bring the girl

will you take a cup with me  i find that mulled wine helps me sleep  i am here at her graces behest  not to drink with you imp  if my sister was so concerned for pycelle  i would have thought shed come herself  instead she sends you  what am i to make of that  i dont care what you make of it  so long as you release your prisoner immediately  and youve received these instructions directly from cersei  as i said several times  and youve waited this long to deliver the information  when the queen regent gives me a command i carry  it out without delay  cersei must have great trust in you  allowing you into her chamber  during the hour of the wolf  the queen regent has a great many responsibilities  she often works from dusk till dawn  she must be very glad to have you helping her  from dusk till dawn  ah lavender oil  she always loved lavender oil even as a girl  i am a knight  an anointed knight yes  tell me did cersei have you knighted  before or after she took you into her bed  what nothing to say  no more warnings for me ser  you will withdraw these filthy accusations  have you ever given any thought  to what king joffrey will have to say  when he finds out youve been bedding his mother  its not my fault  did she take you against your will  can you not defend yourself knight  your own father lord tywin when i was named the kings squire  he told me to obey her in everything  did he tell you to fuck her too  i only meant i did as i was bid  hated every moment of it  is that what youll have me believe  a high place in court a knighthood  my sisters legs spreading open for you at night  oh yes it must have been terrible  wait here his grace will want to hear this  mercy mercy my lord i beg you  save it for joffrey he loves a good grovel  my lord it was your sisters bidding  the queen  ill leave the city at once i swear   no i think not  my lord  you heard me  my father told you to obey my sister  obey her  stay close to her side keep her trust  pleasure her whenever she requires  no one ever need know  as long as you keep faith with me  i want to know what cersei is doing  where she goes who she sees  what they talk of everything  and you will tell me  yes my lord i will  i swear it as you command  oh rise rise  let us drink to our understanding  oh you dont have a cup oh well  smile cousin my sister is a beautiful woman  and its all for the good of the realm  go back and tell her that i beg her forgiveness  that i want no more conflict between us  and that henceforth  i shall do nothing without her consent  but her demands  oh ill give her pycelle   you will  yes ill release him in the morning  cersei can keep him as a pet if she wants  but i will not have him on the council  i could swear that i had not harmed a single hair on his head  but that would not strictly speaking be true   wood creaking    waves crashing   man stay within one table length  your grace  do your knucklebones bring you luck  well lifes been good since you hacked them off your grace  and its four less fingernails to clean   fewer  pardon  four fewer fingernails to clean  never understood why you had to wear them  it reminds me of where i come from and where i am now  it reminds me of your justice  it was an honest punishment  and you were good with the cleaver  you were a hero and a smuggler  a good act does not wash out the bad  nor a bad the good  a lesson ive tried to teach my son   does he listen  to me  gods no  but if your red woman told him to leap from the crows nest  she has a name  i trust youve not forgotten your smugglers tricks  ive lived within the law for 17  i want you to be a smuggler this time  any shore any night  what am i bringing ashore  the red woman  no one must know what you do  and well not
