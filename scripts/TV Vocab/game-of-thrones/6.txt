army   and you have all three  i need a large army  im the last hope of a dynasty mormont  the greatest dynasty this world has ever seen  on my shoulders since i was five years old  and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent  never  not a piece of it  how can i carry what i need to carry without it  hmm  who can rule without wealth or fear or love  oh you stand there all nobility and honor  you dont think i see you looking at my little sister hmm  dont think i know what you want  i dont care you can have her  she can be queen of the savages and dine  on the finest bloody horseparts  and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like  but let me go  you can go  you cant have the eggs  you swore an oath to me  does loyalty mean nothing to you  it means everything to me  and yet here you stand  and yet here i stand  mord  mord  mord  mord  mord  noise again   about the gold  no gold   no gold  listen to me  listen to me  sometimes possession  is an abstract concept  when they captured me they took my purse  but the gold is still mine  where  where i dont know where  but when they free me  you want free  go be free  have you ever heard the phrase  rich as a lannister  of course you have  youre a smart man  you know who the lannisters are  i am a lannister  tyrion son of tywin  and of course you have also heard the phrase  a lannister always pays his debts  if you deliver a message from me  to lady arryn i will be in your debt  i will owe you gold  if you deliver the message  and i live which i very much intend to do  what message  tell her i wish to confess my crimes  you wish to confess your crimes  yes my lady  i do my lady  the sky cells always break them  speak imp  meet your gods as an honest man  where do i begin my lords and ladies  im a vile man  i confess it  my crimes and sins are beyond counting  i have lied and cheated  gambled and whored  im not particularly good at violence  but im good at convincing others to do violence for me  you want specifics i suppose  when i was seven i saw a servant girl  bathing in the river  i stole her robe  she was forced to return to the castle  naked and in tears  if i close my eyes  i can still see her tits bouncing  when i was 10 i stuffed my uncles boots with goatshit  when confronted with my crime  i blamed a squire poor boy was flogged  and i escaped justice  when i was 12  i milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew  i flogged the oneeyed snake  i skinned my sausage  i made the bald man cry  into the turtle stew  which i do believe my sister ate  at least i hope she did  once i brought a jackass and a honeycomb   into a brothel  silence  what happened next  what do you think youre doing  confessing my crimes  lord tyrion you are accused  of hiring a man to slay my son bran in his bed  and of conspiring to murder my sisters husband  lord jon arryn the hand of the king  oh im very sorry  i dont know anything about all that  youve had your little joke  i trust you enjoyed it  mord take him back to the dungeon  but this time find a smaller cell  with a steeper floor  is this how justice  is done in the vale  you accuse me of crimes  i deny them so you throw me into a cell  to freeze and starve  where is the kings justice  i am accused and demand a trial  if youre tried and found guilty  then by the kings own laws you will pay with your life  i understand the law  we have no executioner in the eyrie  life is more elegant here  open the moon door  you want a trial my lord lannister  very well  my son will listen to whatever you have to say  and you will hear his judgment  then you will leave  by one door or the other  no need to bother lord robin  i demand a trial by combat  you have that right  my lady i beg the honor  let me be your champion  the honor should be mine  for the love i bore your lord husband  let me avenge his death   ill fight for you my lady  itll be my honor   the honor should be mine  make the bad man fly  ser vardis  youre quiet  dont you want to avenge my husband  with all my heart my lady  but the imp is half my size  it would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice  agreed  you demanded a trial by combat  now i demand a champion i have that right same as you  my lady  i will gladly fight the imps champion for you  i wouldnt be too glad ser  i name my brother jaime lannister  the kingslayer  is hundreds of miles from here  send a raven for him im happy to wait  the trial will be today  do i have a volunteer  anyone  anyone  i think we can assume that no one is willing  ill stand for the dwarf  more wine your grace   what was i saying  renly simpler time  it was it was youre too young to remember  wasnt it simpler selmy   it was your grace  the enemy was right  in the open  vicious as you like all but sending you a bloody invitation  nothing like today   it sounds exhilarating  exhilarating yes  not as exhilarating as those balls  and masquerades you like to throw  you ever fuck a riverlands girl  once i think  you think i think youd remember  back in our day you werent a real man  until youd fucked one girl from each of the seven kingdoms  and the riverlands   we used to call it making the eight  those were some lucky girls  you ever make the eight barristan  i dont believe so your grace  those were the days  which days exactly  the ones where half of westeros fought the other half and millions died  or before that when the mad king slaughtered women and babies  because the voices in his head told him they deserved it  or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground  easy boy  you might be my brother but youre speaking to the king  i suppose it was all rather heroic  if you were drunk enough and had some poor riverlands whore  to shove your prick inside and make the eight  more wine your grace  they burned most everything in the riverlands  our fields our granaries  our homes  they took our women then they took em again  when they was done they butchered them  as if they was animals  they covered our children  in pitch  and lit them on fire  brigands most likely  they werent thieves  they didnt steal nothing  they even left something behind your grace  its the kings hand youre addressing not the king  the king is hunting  fish the sigil of house tully  isnt that your wifes house tully my lord hand  these men were they flying a sigil   a banner  none your  hand  the one who was leading them  taller by a foot than any man ive ever met  saw him cut the blacksmith in two  saw him take the head off a horse  with a single swing of his sword  that sounds like someone we know  the mountain  youre describing ser gregor clegane  why should ser gregor turn brigand  the man is an anointed knight  ive heard him called tywin lannisters mad dog  im sure you have as well  can you think of any reason  the lannisters might possibly have  for being angry with your wife  maester pycelle if the lannisters  were to order attacks on villages  under the kings protection   it would be  that would be almost as brazen  as attacking the hand of the king in the streets of the capital  well  i cannot give you back your homes  or restore your dead to life  but perhaps i can give you justice  in the name of our king robert  lord beric dondarrion  you shall have the command assemble 100 men   and ride to ser gregors keep  as you command  in the name of robert of the house baratheon  the first of his name  king of the andals and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms  and protector of the realm  i charge you to bring the kings justice  to the false knight gregor clegane  and all those who shared in his crimes  i denounce him  and attaint him  i strip him of all ranks and titles  of all lands and holdings   and sentence him to death  my lord  this this is a drastic action  it would be better to wait for king roberts return   grand maester pycelle  my lord  send a raven to casterly rock  inform tywin lannister that he has been summoned to court  to answer for the crimes of his bannermen  he will arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown  and a traitor to the realm  a bold move my lord and admirable  but is it wise to yank the lions tail  tywin lannister is the richest man in all the seven kingdoms  gold wins wars not soldiers  then how come robert is king  and not tywin lannister  hold   attack attack  come on ser vardis  attack  stand and fight coward  yes  enough ser vardis finish him  what are you doing get up  get up get up get up  raise your sword raise it  get up man   on your feet  get up  get up and fight ser vardis  no have mercy  is it over  you dont fight with honor  no  he did  can i make the little man fly now  not this little man  this little man is going home  i believe you have something of mine  a lannister always pays his debts  you wear your hair like a real southern lady now  well why shouldnt i were in the south  its important to

comes to visit  with a big belly and a little prick  and he cant get it up so he knocks all your teeth out  and what will happen to me if i stay here  will i become lady greyjoy   mistress of the iron islands  dont be a fool  i hear jaime lannister attacked lord stark  in the streets of kings landing  every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon  and most of them will never come
