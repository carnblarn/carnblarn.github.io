with honor  and they repaid me with treachery  you treated them with honor by butchering them  before i had to kill them i treated them  you seized their home as is your right   were ironborn we take what we need  exactly  then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away  is that treachery  id call it bravery  they made me a promise  your little boy prisoners made you a promise  and you got mad when they broke it  are you the dumbest cunt alive   dont call me a  a cunt  a dumb cunt who killed the only two starks in winterfell  you know how valuable those boys were  if i hadnt

this lot  youre not ive come to bring you home   father wants a word  is this a joke  winterfell is the heart of the north  aye it is hundreds of miles from the sea  were islanders baby brother  had you forgotten that  our power comes from our ships  and now that youve decorated your walls  with the bodies of the stark boys  every man in the north wants to see you hanged  when robb stark finds

mance want with a dead mans bastard  i dont know  i think hell want to decide for himself  he runs ill chop his balls off  he runs ill do it meself  were even now jon snow  i couldnt do it  i had the

her first name  im sure youll be very happy   both laugh   and youre marrying her for a bridge   an important bridge  ah  it was before they killed my father  i still thought i could march south and rescue him in time  but only if i crossed that bridge  when i speak to people from the north  they all loved your father  he was the best man i ever met  i know children always think that about their fathers but  children do not always think that about their fathers  believe me  he once told me that being a lord is like being a father  except you have thousands of children  and you worry about all of them  the farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect  the charwomen scrubbing the floors yours to protect  the soldiers you order into battle  he told me he woke with fear in the morning  and went to bed with fear in the night  i didnt believe him  i asked him  how can a man be brave if hes afraid  that is the only time a man can be brave he told me  i wish i could have met him  he would have liked you  most lords worry more about their gold  and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors  he didnt care much about gold or glory  and you  you think im fighting this war so theyll sing songs about me  i want to go home  i want the men following me to go home  then why dont you  because well never be safe until the lannisters are defeated  and because i believe in justice  chopping off joffreys head you mean  that would be a start   horse neighs hoofbeats approaching   your grace milady  the kingslayer he escaped in the night  how  how  tell me this isnt true  why   for the girls  you betrayed me   robb  no  you knew i would not allow it  and you did it anyway  bran and rickon are captives in winterfell  sansa and arya are captives in kings landing  i have five children and only one of them is free  i lost one son fighting by your sons side  i lost another to the kingslayer  strangled with a chain  you commit treason  because your children are prisoners  i would carve out my heart  and offer it to the father if he would let my sons  wake from their graves and step into a prison cell  i grieve for your sons my lord  i dont want your grief i want my vengeance  and you stole it from me  killing jaime lannister  would not buy life for your children  but returning him to kings landing  may buy life for mine  jaime lannister has played you for a fool  youve weakened our position  youve brought discord into our camp  and you did it all behind my back  make sure shes guarded day and night  robb  how many men did we send in pursuit of the kingslayer   send another 40 with our fastest horses  robb   neighing   whoa oof   groans   damn  youre much uglier in daylight  whats your name  im jaime lannister of casterly rock  son of tywin  a captive

men like you into the dust  if youre so confident unlock my chains  lets see what happens  do you take me for an idiot in  i took you for a fighter  a man pardon woman of honor  was i wrong  youre afraid  maybe one day well find out kingslayer  kevan kings landing will fall an hour  after stannis lands his force  its not too late for king joffrey and cersei  and the court to ride west to safety  surrender the iron throne  better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates  stannis will execute them all  no a king who runs will not be king for long  hes a lannister hell stand and fight  stannis two days from the capital  and the wolf at my doorstep  the scouts assure us robb stark remains north of ashemark  ha the last time the scouts assured us  of starks movement he lured us into a trap  which is why my son is his prisoner  too close to casterly rock  he sent a splinter force  to recapture winterfell  the greyjoys have done us a great favor  stark wont risk marching on casterly rock  until hes at full force  hes a boy and hes never lost a battle  hell risk anything at any time  because he doesnt know enough to be afraid  well ride at nightfall  i want a full nights march before he knows were on the move  clegane youll maintain a garrison here at harrenhal  track down this brotherhood and destroy them  the girl has proven herself a good servant  shell stay on with you  see that he doesnt get drunk in the evenings  hes poor company when hes sober  but hes better at his work  youve got some questions to answer  man who killed ser amory   man 2 i dont know  give me the name   man 2 please  man 3 take this one out for the crows  man 2 i told you i dont know  please  look its yorens little cunt  used to be a boy now its a girl    man laughs   wheres jaqen  dont care  wheres your stick now bitch  i promised to fuck you with it  guard come on time to kill some wolves   men shouting   you need sour cherries to make it right  and the secret is you dry the stones and then you  break them with a mallet  thats where the real flavor is  you crush em up real fine  and then when youre finished you sprinkle them over the piecrust   wheres jaqen  how would i know  i need him now  lord tywins marching tonight   you need him  hes helping me   hot pie i saw him  where   where  ow  where  they went riding out the gates a few hours ago  on patrol let go of my ears   horses neighing men shouting   what do you want with him anyway   men shouting    wind howling   qhorin mance is gonna march on the wall  when he does one brother inside his army  will be worth 1000 fighting against it   theyll never trust me  they might   if you do what needs to be done  what  how does it feel knowing those men all died  so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl  i didnt  i should have known better trusting a traitors bastard  hes not yours to kill crow  do you have to do that here  i like to keep me hands clean  yes but do you have to do it here  you should start wearing the gold cloak  i dont want to wear a gold cloak  youre commander of the city watch  you shouldnt be dressed like a common sellsword  a cloak slows you down in a fight  makes it hard to move quietly  and the gold catches the light  so youre nice and easy to spot at night  well youre not sneaking through alleyways any longer  youre supposed to stand out  we had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasnt part of it  fine fine  no gold cloak   what  what  what what why are you staring at me   scoffs  you dont want me cleaning me nails  you dont want me looking your way  why am i here  to help me plan the defense of kings landing   laughs   stannis will be here any day   sighs   and one of these explains how to beat him  an history of the great sieges of westeros  by archmaester shevelathin  shevelatesh  chevalteesh  id swap all your books for a few good archers  my lord hand commander  i must compliment you  on the gold cloaks performance these last few weeks  did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery  i did not know  and how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery  me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves  for questioning  uh no  its just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now   we talked about this  aye we talked about it  have you ever been in a city under siege  maybe this parts not in your books  see its not the fighting that kills most people  its the starving foods worth more than gold  noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes  things get bad enough  the poor start eating each other  the thieves they love a siege  soon as the gates are sealed they steal all the food  by the time its all over theyre the richest men in town  given the circumstances my lord  i believe extreme measures are warranted  ah  the great sieges of westeros  thrilling subject  shame archmaester chvyalthan wasnt a better writer  stannis knows kings landing  he knows where the walls are strongest  and he knows which gates are weakest  the mud gate  a good ram will batter it down in minutes  and its only 50 yards from the water  thats where hell land  and if stannis does attack the mud gate  what is our plan  we could throw books at his men  we dont have that many books  we dont have that many men either  what do we have  pig shit   wind howling    chatter    panting   im not cut out for this sort of work  i always imagined meself doing something much worse  were digging latrine pits at the end of the world  i cant imagine anything much worse  dolorous edd you lack imagination  sam where do you think jon is right now  he went off with the halfhand he didnt come back  a betting man would go with dead  hes not dead  no jons a great fighter  well hes better than me  and a lot better than you  hes got a valyrian steel sword  so did his father  and qhorin halfhand is the greatest ranger alive  great rangers never get old is the problem  shit ones neither  its them in the middle that last a long time   clangs   what in seven hells is that  the first men made these marks  help me with it   straining   look  if you find something youre not supposed to  best thing to do is pretend youve never seen it  thats a nights watch cloak  its been here a long time  oh must be dragonglass  grenn dragonglass  the maesters call it obsidian  why would a brother hide it here  i expect its cause he wanted somebody to find it  mind where youre going  im sorry ill   where were you  a man has patrol duty  tywin lannister was right here  and now hes gone  a girl owes one more name  the red god demands it give the man a name  how long after i give you the name  does it take you to kill someone  a minute an hour a month  death is certain the time is not  hes taking his army to attack my brother  i need him dead right now  this a man cannot do  you promised youd help me  help was not promised lovely girl  only death there must be others  give a name any name  and youll kill them  anybody  by the seven new gods and the old gods beyond counting  i swear it  all right  jaqen hghar  a girl gives a man his own name   thats right  gods are not mocked   this is no joking thing  im not joking  a man can go kill himself   unname me  no  please  ill unname you  thank you  if you help me and my friends escape  this would require more than one life   this is not part of our bargain  fine jaqen hghar  a girl lacks honor  if i do this thing a girl must obey  a girl will obey  a girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight  thank you podrick  odd little boy  i have a certain sympathy for odd little boys  you and varys both  excellent lamprey pie  were you slaving away in the kitchen all day  i hear joffrey plans on fighting  an inspiration for the troops  the young king in his shining armor  fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel  hes only a boy  younger boys are off fighting his war  hes not ready  what is he 17   remember jaime at 17  better than you  some men have a gift for this sort of thing  some dont  his place is not on the battlefield  its not on the throne either  sadly for all of us  do you think im an idiot  no id say you possess above average intelligence  you shipped off my only daughter  and now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die  hell have his kingsguard protecting him  he has the finest armor gold can buy  he needs to be out there  the men will fight more fiercely seeing their king  fighting beside them  instead of hiding behind his mothers skirts  any dessert  do you know why varys is so dangerous  because he has thousands of spies in his employ  because he knows everything we do before we do it  because he doesnt have a cock  neither do you  perhaps im dangerous too  you on the other hand  are as big a fool as every other man  that little worm between your legs  does half your thinking   its not that little   laughs   why are you smiling  because im happy  and why are you happy  because i have your little whore  i thought you preferred blondes  such a droll little fellow  tell me have you married this one yet  no  oh good father will be so pleased  why do you care who i fuck  because a lannister always pays her debts  you stole my only daughter  you plot to have joffrey killed  this is madness stannis will be here in days   you need me  for what  your skill in battle  pretty thing your whore  lovely body  the bruises will heal in time  where did you find her  varys isnt the only one who hears whispers  really a lannister lion necklace  you need to hide your secret whores more carefully  youve forgotten the most important thing about whores  oh  well youre the expert  tell me  you dont buy them you only rent them  youre usually a better liar baby brother  this one you like  you like her very much  could it be love  dont worry shell be treated gently enough  unless joffrey is hurt  and then every wound he suffers shell suffer too  and if he dies  there isnt a man alive who could devise  a more painful death for your little cunt  and how do i know you havent killed her already  would you like to see her  i thought you might  ser mandon bring in my brothers whore  im sorry they hurt you  you must be brave  i promise i will free you  dont forget me  never   door opens closes   i will hurt you for this  a day will come when you think youre safe and happy  and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth  and you will know the debt is paid  get out  shae  ive been waiting all night  what is wrong  youre beautiful  then why do you look sad  we have to be more careful  dont be afraid i can take care of myself  there are people who want to hurt me  i know i wont let them  ill cut off their faces i will  i would kill for you do you know that  i expect ill have to before this is over  youre mine  im yours  promise me  im yours and you are mine  robb still no word  weve sent a dozen ravens  none have returned  my bastard is only a few days from winterfell   once he captures the castle  theon has my brothers   if we storm the castle  he wouldnt dare hurt the boys  theyre his only hope of escaping the north with his head  send word to your son  any ironborn who surrender  will be allowed to return safely to their homes  a touch of mercy is a virtue your grace too much  any ironborn with the exception of theon greyjoy  he betrayed our cause  he betrayed me  and we will hunt him down no matter where he runs  i expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute  they hear the offer  your pardon my lord your grace  my lady  how are you  how am i  ive had to arrest my mother  the lannisters have my sisters  the man i considered my closest friend  has seized my home and my brothers  im fighting a war and i dont know if i should march south or north  im sorry it was a stupid question   im sorry  no  forgive me  youre being kind i have no right  you have every right  youre a king  thats not the kind of king i want to be  what kind do you want to be  i dont know the good kind  most kings grew up as princes  they spend their whole lives preparing for the crown  i was raised to be lord of winterfell  i was raised to be a proper little lady  to play the harp and dance the latest steps  and recite valyrian poetry  id like to hear you play the harp  no no you would not   laughs   how did you go from reciting valyrian poetry  to sawing off mens feet  when i was 12  my mother and father went to a wedding  weddings in volantis last for days you know  and they left me with my little brother  the second afternoon they were gone  was the hottest day in the threeyear summer  we couldnt bear to be inside so we ran down to the rhoyne  every child in volantis was in the rhoyne that day  the rich the poor we were all there  naked screaming racing to the little islands  drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank  i was treading water  talking to a friend  when i realized i hadnt seen my brother  i called his name  then i started screaming his name  and then i saw him  floating facedown  my heart just stopped  i was  i dragged him from the water  my friend helped me i think  i dont even remember  he was so little  then we pulled him onto the riverbank  and i screamed at him  and i shook him  and he was dead  just dead  a man ran over  he had a fish tattoo on his face  in volantis the slaves have tattoos  so you know what they are without having to talk to them  and this man worked on a fishing boat  and he pushed me out of the way  you have to understand  for a slave to push a highborn girl  thats death for the man a terrible death  but he pushed me out of the way  and he started pressing on my brothers chest  again and again and again  until my brother spat out  half of the rhoyne  and cried out  and the man cradled his head and told him to be calm  i decided two things that day  i would not waste my years  planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies  and when i came of age  i would never live in a slave city again   sighs  im sorry your grace  you told me of your problems and ive blathered on  i dont want to marry the frey girl  i dont want you to marry her  but you needed that bridge  i hope its a very beautiful bridge   laughs   hot pie the sour cherries was all crushed up and ready  gendry shut up  probably in the piecrust by now  in the oven the nice warm oven  shut up what did you bring  the cheese could be better  i did get some nice sausages  what did he want us to do about those guards  he didnt say  he just said walk through the gates  gendry what about the guards  he didnt say anything about the guards  what he left that bit out  its a pretty important part dont you think   we have to trust him  trust him  you trusted him to fight with us and you set him free   and he ran  i want to go back to the kitchens  shut up stay here if youre afraid  hot pie arry dont  away reset  if the wind holds well reach kings landing in a day  will it hold  cant make promises for the wind your grace  man again pull  i admire you ser davos  i thank you your grace pleased to hear it  some highborn fools call you onion knight  and think they insult you  so you take the onion for your sigil  sew it on your coat fly the onion flag  my son wishes me to change it  three mermen with tridents something like that  i understand why the older families look down at me  do you why   my father was a crabber  and  well sons of lords dont like to break bread with sons of crabbers  our hands stink  and where were those lords when storms end starved  many fought bravely for your brother  many fought for the mad king  you defend these men who insult you behind your back  some are happy to do it to my face  we were forgotten  robert and ned stark they were the heroes  the glorious rebels marching from battle to battle  liberating towns from the yoke of the mad king  while i held storms end with 500 men   no one has forgotten your grace  no robert did  he gave storms end to renly after the war  renly never fought a day in his life   he was only a boy  then whyd he give him storms end  first we ate the horses  we werent riding anyway not with the castle surrounded  we couldnt feed them so fine the horses  then the cats never liked cats  so fine i do like dogs  good animals loyal  but we ate them then the rats  the night before you slipped through  i thought my wife was dying  she couldnt speak anymore she was so frail  and then you made it through the lines  slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions  and potatoes some salted beef i believe  every man in storms end wanted to kiss you that night  i was relieved they did not  robert told me to hold storms end so i held it  then he told me he was giving it to renly  so i gave it up  insult or no i gave it up  because robert was my older brother and he was the king  and ive always done my duty  but now im the rightful king by every law of westeros  and when i sit the iron throne youll be my hand  your grace  i pray i serve you well  i expect youll be the first crabbers son to wear the badge  youre the master of whisperers  youre supposed to know everything  no man can be in all rooms at all times  i have many little birds in the north my lord  but i havent heard their songs  since theon greyjoy captured winterfell  the stark forces are distracted  now is the time to strike  to strike  my dear nephew you do see these men  preparing the walls for siege  you do understand stannis baratheon sails this way  if my uncle stannis lands on the shores of kings landing  ill ride out to greet him  a brave choice your grace  im sure your men will line up behind you  they say stannis never smiles  ill give him a red smile  from ear to ear  imagine stanniss terror  i am trying  youre an intelligent man  id like to think im an intelligent man  oh no one disputes that my lord  not even the multitudes who despise you  i wish we could converse as two honest intelligent men  i wish we could too  what do you want  tell me  if were going to play  youll have to start  my brother was the youngest kingsguard in history  my sister became queen at the age of 19  when i reached manhood  my father put me in charge of all the drains  and cisterns in casterly rock  a most highborn plumber  the water never flowed better  and all the shit found its way to the sea  i never expected to have any real power  so when my father named me acting hand  youre quite good at being hand you know  jon arryn and ned stark were good men  honorable men  but they disdained the game and those who played   you enjoy the game  i do  last thing i expected  and you play it well  id like to keep playing it  if stannis breaches the gates the game is over  they say he burns his enemies alive  to honor the lord of light  the lord of light wants his enemies burned  the drowned god wants them drowned  why are all the gods such vicious cunts  where is the god of tits and wine  in the summer isles  they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats  we should sail there immediately  this morning i heard a song  all the way from qarth beyond the red waste  daenerys targaryen lives  a girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems  she has three dragons  but even if what they say is true  itll be years before they are fully grown  and then there will be nowhere to hide  one game at a time my friend   men shouting   jorah careful khaleesi  xaro owns this city and the warlocks have 1000  eyes watching for you  i found one  a ship with a good captain  she leaves for astapor tomorrow   astapor  we cannot stay here  they have my dragons  a mother does not flee without her children  theyre not your children  i know they call you the mother of dragons  and i know you love them but you didnt grow them in your womb  they didnt suckle at your breast they are dragons khaleesi  and if we stay in qarth well die  you should sail to astapor im sure youll be safe there  you know i would die for you  i will never abandon you  im sworn to protect you to serve  then serve me  if my dragons are in the house of the undying  then take me there  thats what the warlock wants  he told you so himself  if you enter that place you will never leave again   his magic is strong  and what of my magic  you saw me step into the fire  you watched the witch burn what did the flames do to me  do you remember  until my last breath i will remember  after i have forgotten my mothers face  they are my children  and they are the only children i will ever have  take me to them  we should bury them  id leave em up a few more days  sends a message  if they havent got the damn message yet  a few more days wont help  as you say  but it dont hurt to let em rot a while longer  whats this  gold for the farmer  for his trouble  his troubles are done  hes feeding the crops now  his wife too  you want to keep a man silent you silence him  got as far as the farm and then doubled back  walked through the stream to throw off the hounds  hoped this would be the last place theyd think to look  youre right  so far  who was that out there  hung up the gates  must have been the farmers boys  he killed them and burned them  and passed them off as the little lords  shh shh shh  they mustnt know  bran would blame himself  osha theyll never hear it from me  the little lads have suffered
