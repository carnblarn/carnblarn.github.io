                 theme music playing     wind blowing    men shouting   what was she like  she  she had red hair  oh   how big were her feet  what do you want me to say  i want you to tell me what it was like to have someone  to be with someone  to love someone and have them love you back  were all gonna die a lot sooner than id planned  youre the closest ill ever get to knowing  so you and gilly never  no  she just had a baby  and she never offered  but if she had  you would have  youd have broken your vows  the interesting thing is  our vows never specifically forbid  intimate relations with women  what  i shall take no wife yes thats in there theres no denying that  i shall father no children its very specific  but what do our vows have to say about other  activities is open to interpretation  i dont think ser alliser cares much for interpretation  anyway theres nothing for him to interpret  we didnt  so whats it like  its  theres this person this whole other person  and youre wrapped up in them and theyre wrapped up in you  and you  for a little  for a little while youre more than just you  youre i dont know im not a bleeding poet  no youre really not  what did i get for it  an arrow six inches from my heart  therell be arrows for all of us soon i imagine  there will  theyve already done the worst thing to me they could ever do  go get some sleep sam  ill take this watch   screeches    screeches   did i ever tell you about her   my sheila  yes  that was a night to remember  of course id had a good bit to drink   chuckles   her fangs were sharp  but she knew how to use them  and she was nice and soft down below  no she was no ordinary beast  many is the man who  i know you never fucked a bear  you know you never fucked a bear  right now i dont want to think about the bear you never fucked  right now all i want to think about  is each one of these arrows finding its way into a crows heart  we could be waiting here a while  good  the longer we wait the more arrows ill have  they came up here to our land  and put up a big wall and said it was theirs  then they started hunting us down  this time were the ones doing the hunting  youve got a lot to say about killing  even more words than arrows  back in those villages i killed just as many of them as you did  more i reckon  yes but none of those were your crow lover  i probably killed him already  styr so youve said  and if not  the only thing left of him is gonna be his fun bits hanging around my neck  styr more words  know what i think you do when you see him  serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge   men laughing   you been thinking about that ginger minge  wondering what maybe i have  jon snow is mine  anyone else tries to kill him  ill have an arrow for them  and not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me  and what is it that couldnt wait until morning tarly  maester aemon   how did you know  that it was you  who else but samwell tarly  would be wasting candles  to read in the middle of the night   let me help you  oh no need  i know my way around this library  better than any other place in castle black  thousands of books  and no eyes to read them  old age is a wonderful source of ironies  if nothing else  but you didnt answer my question  what are you reading  maester faull  ah the wildlings  i can assure you that the closest maester faull  ever got to a wildling was this very library  but what he says about what they do  its all true  its exactly what the survivors of their raids report  yes imagine the stories wildlings tell about us  love is the death of duty  i told that to your friend jon snow once  he didnt listen and neither did you  which is why youve abandoned your watch atop the wall  to come here and read about the terrible things  that may have happened to the girl you love  i dont love her   yes you do  no  yes you do  heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me  i remember how it sounds  i was in love once  you were  you can imagine all manner of horrors  befalling that poor girl and her child  is it so difficult to imagine  that an old person was once  more or less like you  im sorry maester  i didnt mean it like that  do you know who i was before i came here  what i could have been if id only said the word  of course you do  i met many girls when i was aemon targaryen  a future king always does  some of them were quite forward  in their attempts to win my affections  one of them succeeded  i was very young  who was she  ah  i could tell you everything about her  who she was  how we met  the color of her eyes  and the shape of her nose  i can see her  right in front of me  shes more real than you are  we could spend all night trading tales of lost loves  nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit  than the prospect of imminent death  go to bed tarly  pyp  sorry i cant open the gate for anybody orders  gilly  you dont understand they killed everyone  everyone but
