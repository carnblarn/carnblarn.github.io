kneeling before the kingbeyondthewall  if im a traitor then you are too  why do you want to join us jon snow  i want to be free  no i dont think so  i think what you want most of all  is to be a hero  ill ask you one last time  why do you want to join us  we stopped at crasters keep on the way north  i saw  you saw what  i saw craster take his own baby boy  and leave it in the woods  i saw what took it  youre telling me you saw one of them  and why would that make you desert your brothers  because when i told the lord commander  he already knew  thousands of years ago the first men  battled the white walkers and defeated them  i want to fight for the side that fights for the living  did i come to the right place  well need to find you a new cloak  what if you took off that bit there  dont you want to leave something to the imagination  trouble is ive never had much imagination  i want you to take it off  mouth  ser bronn ser bronn  i didnt hear that   apologies ser  back away  keep backing away till youre outside this establishment   then back away some more  lord tyrion sent me  i will murder you boy  he said it was a matter of life and death   pod  its your sister  the queen  what are they doing here  protecting me i assume will you let me in  no i dont think so  if i wanted to kill you do you think  id let a wooden door stop me  they stay outside  im not afraid of you little brother   why are you here  i wanted to see your face  they said youd lost your nose but its not as gruesome as all that  the man who cut me lost more than his nose  i should hope so  the rebels came for joffreys head they lost their own  thanks to father  thanks to father  of course it wasnt a rebel who tried to kill me  no curious  bit of a comedown from chamber of the hand  but then i dont suppose you need much room  grand maester pycelle made the same joke  you must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees  youre meeting father today  how do you know that  because i have hundreds of spies in my employ  the master of whisperers owes me a favor or two  father told me what do you want from him  what do i want from him hes my father  do i need to want something  im sure he loves me dearly  as any father loves his child  his baby boy  yet he hasnt come to visit once  since arriving in kings landing  i lay here my face split in half  but father never came  youre going to make me cry  why do you care what i want from him  because youve slandered me to father before  slandered when  you told him i had my guards  beat that servant girl at casterly rock  you did have your guards beat her  a girl of nine i believe  i was nine too  she lost an eye if i remember correctly  if i remember correctly  she never stole a necklace again  its not slander if its true  and whats this truth you plan on telling him today  why are you so nervous  about what im going to say to father  because youre a liar  i expect youll tell lies about me about joffrey  any lies in particular  youre a clever man  but youre not half as clever as you think you are  still makes me more clever than you  oh look at these two shining warriors  ser taryn mant and  ser whosit of whocares  ser meryn trant  ser bronn of the blackwater   youre no knight  pod  ser bronn of the blackwater  was anointed by the king himself  youre an upjumped cutthroat  nothing more  thats exactly who i am  and youre a grub in fancy armor  whos better at beating little girls than fighting men  now i have an appointment with lord tyrion  you put your hand on that door  you lose the hand  as much as i appreciate a walk in the sunshine your lordship  i am wondering why you sent for me  a number of people in this city want to kill me  youre here to protect me  ive been doing that for a while now  do you grow bored protecting me  i grow poor protecting you  poor poor  under my patronage youve become a knight  youve served as commander of the city watch   briefly  im sure you filled your pockets  and now my pockets are empty  youve given me a taste for the finer things  and if you want me to carry on protecting you  youll need to pay more   i thought we were friends  we are  but im a sellsword i sell my sword  i dont loan it out to friends as a favor   how much  double   double  im a knight now  knights are worth double  i dont even know how much im paying you now  which means you can afford it  here here  help me  who are you  i was in the battle at blackwater  i was a captain and a knight  aye ser and serving which king  the one true king of westeros  stannis baratheon  i thought you were dead  everyone thought you were dead  and your son  he may have swam ashore as you did  no the wildfire took him i saw it  im so sorry my friend  i too have lost a son  there is nothing worse in this world  but davos you were a good father  if i was a good father hed still be here  stannis lives  he licks his wounds at dragonstone  will you take me there  there is nothing for me at dragonstone  this war is not over  not for you maybe  but for salladhor saan the war is over  were both sworn to king stannis  i am sworn to no man  i promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory  i delivered the ships  stannis never gives up never   now he will regroup  hes a broken man  his fleet lies at the bottom of blackwater bay  they say he sees no one  not his generals not even his wife  only the red woman  whispering in his ear  telling him what she sees in the flames  and burning men alive  what  they built a great fire when stannis returned  all those who spoke against her she called  servants of darkness  they say she sang to them as they burned  im a pirate  youre a smuggler  servants of darkness  im thinking dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid  take me back there please  you cannot turn stannis against her  maybe not but i could carve her heart out  you could try  if you fail they will burn you  if you succeed theyll burn you  and youve only just come back to life  stay alive a little longer my friend  you call me friend you drank with me on my wedding day  and you drank with me on four of my wedding days  but i dont ask you for favors  i have to stop her  please do this for me  when you are dead  i will gather your bones in a little sack  and let your widow wear them around her neck  we should set the siege lines  there wont be a siege the mountain cant defend a ruin  i imagine the mountain will defend  whatever tywin lannister tells him to defend  the lannisters have been running from us since oxcross  id love a fight the men would love a fight  i dont think were going to get one  slaughtered like sheep  the debt will be repaid my friend  for them and for your sons  will it  they rot in the ground  while their killer runs free  the kingslayer wont remain free for long  my best hunters are after him   a mallister  ser jeremy  my fathers bannerman  find her a chamber that will serve as a cell  shes your mother  she freed jaime lannister  the lannisters robbed them of their sons  and she robbed them of their justice  water  water  this needs to be cleaned and closed  whats your name friend  qyburn  youre lucky to be alive  lucky  the badge looks good on you  almost as good as it looked on me  are you enjoying your new position  am i enjoying it  i was very happy as hand of the king  yes  i heard how happy you were  you brought a whore into my bed  it wasnt your bed at the time  i sent you here to advise the king  i gave you real power and authority  you chose to spend your days  as you always have  bedding harlots  and drinking with thieves  occasionally i drank with the harlots  what do you want tyrion  why does everyone assume i want something  cant i simply visit with my beloved father  my beloved father who  somehow forgot to visit his wounded son  after he fell on the battlefield  maester pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal  i organized the defense of this city  while you held court in the ruins of harrenhal  i led the foray when the enemies were at the gate  while your grandson the king  quivered in fear behind the walls  i bled in the mud for our family  and as my reward  i was trundled off to some dark little cell  but what do i want  a little bloody gratitude would be a start  jugglers and singers require applause  you are a lannister  do you think i demanded a garland of roses  every time i suffered a wound on a battlefield  hmm  now i have seven kingdoms to look after  and three of them are in open rebellion  so tell me what you want  i want what is mine by right  jaime is your eldest son heir to your lands and titles  but he is a kingsguard forbidden from marriage or inheritance  the day jaime put on the white cloak  he gave up his claim to casterly rock  i am your son and lawful heir  you want casterly rock  it is mine by right  well find you accommodations  more suited to your name  and as a reward for your accomplishments  during the battle of blackwater bay  and when the time is right you will be given a position  fit for your talents  so that you can serve your family  and protect our legacy  and if you serve faithfully  you will be rewarded with a suitable wife  and i would let myself be consumed by maggots  before mocking the family name  and making you heir to casterly rock   why  why  you ask that  you who killed your mother to come into the world  you are an illmade spiteful little creature  full of envy lust and low cunning  mens laws give you the right to bear my name  and display my colors since i cannot prove that you are not mine  and to teach me humility the gods have condemned me  to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion  that was my fathers sigil and his fathers before him  but neither gods nor men  will ever compel me to let you turn casterly rock  into your whorehouse  go now  speak no more of your rights to casterly rock  go  oh one more thing  the next whore i catch in your bed ill hang  dorne its going to dorne   why dorne  its carrying silk  and its supposed to bring back wine in exchange  but its not coming back  the captains tired of risking his life  so kings landing lords and ladies  can get drunk on better wine than they deserve  hes going to stay in dorne  wait out the winter where its beautiful and warm  i met some people in dorne who werent so beautiful and warm  dont ruin the game  i told you i dont want to play  what about that one there  that one  its going to volantis  why  because when i got on a ship in volantis  it looked like that one  thats not how the game works  youre not supposed to just blurt out the right answer  youve got to invent a story  about where the ship is going and why  why should i make up a story when i know the truth  because the truth  is always either terrible or boring  lovely day for it  watching the ships  lord baelish  might i speak with lady sansa  alone for a moment  i saw your mother not long ago  shes very eager to see you  and your sister  aryas alive  you said youd take me home  you said kings landing was your home  you are the property of the crown  stealing you would be treason  if you were to tell just one person   i wont tell anyone  how do i know  because im a terrible liar  you said so yourself  please lord baelish tell me what to do tell me when  im waiting for word on an assignment  that will take me far away from the capital  when i set sail  i might be able to take you with me  but youll need to be ready to leave on a moments notice  youre her handmaiden  yes and youre his  i help manage his affairs   hes an important person  so is she  i grew up in the shadow of her fathers castle  the day she was born they rang the bells  from sunrise till sunset  weve both done rather well you and i  yes  given where we started  and where is that  its not easy for girls like us  to dig our way out  watch out for her  i always do  watch out for her with him  theyre growing fast  not fast enough  i cant wait that long  i need an army  well be in astapor by nightfall  some say the unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world  the greatest slavesoldiers in the world  the distinction means a good deal to some people  do those people have any better ideas  about how to put you on the iron throne  its too beautiful a day to argue  youre right  another lovely day on the high seas  dont mock them  theyre the first dothraki who have ever been on a ship  they followed me across the poison water  if theyll do it others will  and with a true khalasar  the dothraki follow strength above all khaleesi  youll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong  and not before  your grace  i heard you were dead  not yet  i had hoped to speak to you alone your grace  we are alone  your grace you are the rightful king  not only by blood  youre an honorable man a just man  and there is still a war to fight  i am fighting  by burning prisoners alive  how would you punish the infidels ser davos  i do not judge people for the gods they worship  if i did id have thrown you in the sea  before you ever set foot on dragonstone   im not your enemy  you are my enemy  was it me you fought on blackwater bay  did i set your ships ablaze  i wasnt there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands  i could have saved those men  you would have taken the city  stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne  and you would stand beside him  but i wasnt there  because you convinced your king to leave me behind  do you hear them screaming  all those burning men in the water  crying for their mothers  for their gods for help  until the moment the blackwater swallowed them  dont despair ser davos  what i told your son is true  death by fire  is the purest death  this woman is evil  shes the mother of demons  take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell   your grace  come on  youve chosen the darkness ser davos   she will destroy us all  i will pray for you  your grace  halt down  halt down  why have we stopped  its lady margaery your grace  what is she doing who gave her permission  my lady we should have guards my lady  why  pardon me  stop my lady youll ruin your dress  i have others  would you like to speak with her your grace  no  he was a soldier  he went to fight on the walls  when the ships came into blackwater bay  he never came back  and your mother  she died when she had me  bad men wanted to come into this city  and do terrible things but your father stopped them  whenever you look at this knight  i want you to remember your father  he wasnt a knight  he was just a soldier  and what do knights swear to do  protect the weak and uphold the good  your father did that be proud of him  was your father a soldier too  you should be proud too  under king joffreys leadership  your fathers saved the city  they saved us all  from now on were going to take care of you  all of you  come to me for whatever you need to feed them  clothe them or house them  directly to me   your grace  your grace  please sit sit  i do apologize my lady  small council meetings  at what point does it become treason  to waste the kings time  thats a lovely gown my lady  yes it suits you perfectly  i imagine you might be rather cold  the climate is a bit more forgiving back in highgarden your grace  shall i have them bring you a shawl my lady  i am touched by your concern your grace  luckily for us tyrells our blood runs quite warm   doesnt it loras  yes  loras isnt the queens gown magnificent  the fabric the embroidery the metalwork  ive never seen anything like it  you might find a bit of armor quite useful  once you become queen perhaps before  joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at flea bottom  on your way back from the sept this morning  yes i paid a visit to an orphanage  the high septon told me about  margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in highgarden  the lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance  and approach them with an open heart  an open heart is what youll get in flea bottom  if youre not careful my dear  not long ago we were attacked by a mob there  we had a full complement of guards that didnt stop them  the king barely escaped with his life  my mothers always had a penchant for drama  facts become less and less important to her  as she grows older  our lives were never truly in danger  youre right of course  but you are your fathers son  we cant all have a kings bravery  hunger turns men into beasts  im glad house tyrell has been able to help in this regard  they tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the reach  wheat barley apples weve had a blessed harvest  and of course its our duty to assist the capital  in time of need  well as ser loras said  lady margaery has done this sort of  charitable work before  im sure she knows what shes doing  im sure she does  the unsullied have stood here for a day and a night  with no food or water  they will stand until they drop  such is their obedience  they may suit my needs  tell me of their training  they begin their training at five  every day they drill from dawn to dusk  until they have mastered the shortsword  the shield and the three spears  only one boy in four survives this rigorous training  their discipline and loyalty are absolute  they fear nothing  even the bravest men fear death  my master says the unsullied are not men  death means nothing to them  he begs you attend to this carefully your grace  tell the good master there is no need  my master points out that men dont need nipples  to win his shield  an unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark  find a newborn and kill it before its mothers eyes  this way my master says we make certain  there is no weakness left in them  you take a babe from its mothers arms  kill it as she watches and pay for her pain with a silver coin  my master would like you to know that the silver is paid  to the babys owner not the mother  how many do you have to sell   master kraznys asks that you please hurry  many other buyers are interested   the unsullied are a means to an end  once i own them these men  theyre not men not anymore  once i own an army of slaves what will i be  do you think these slaves will have better lives  serving kraznys and men like him or serving you  youll be fair to them  you wont mutilate them to make a point  you wont order them to murder babies  youll see theyre properly fed and sheltered  a great injustice has been done to them  closing your eyes will not undo it  the warlocks  i owe you my life ser  the honor is mine  my queen  you know this man  i know him  as one of the greatest fighters the seven kingdoms has ever seen  and as the lord commander  of robert baratheons kingsguard  king robert is dead  i have been searching for you daenerys stormborn  to ask your forgiveness  i was sworn to protect your family  i failed them  i am barristan selmy  kingsguard to your father  allow me to join your queensguard  and i will not fail you again
