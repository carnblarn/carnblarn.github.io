                1 game of thrones 1x09  baelor original air date on june 12 2011   youve seen better days my lord  another visit  it seems youre my last friend  no no many still love you  sansa came to court this morning  to plead for your life  on her knees begging for me hmmm  did you laugh with the others  you do me wrong my lord  your blood is the last thing i want  i dont know what you want  ive given up trying to guess  when i was still a boy  before they cut my balls off with a hot knife  i traveled with a group of actors through the free cities  they taught me that each man has a role to play  the same is true at court  i am the master of whisperers  my role is to be sly obsequious and without scruples  im a good actor my lord  huh can you free me from this pit  i could  but will i  no  as i said im no hero  what do you want tell me  no riddles no stories tell me what do you want  peace  did you know that your son is marching south  with an army of northmen loyal lad  fighting for his fathers freedom  robb  hes just a boy  boys have been conquerors before  but the man giving cersei sleepless nights  is the kings the late kings brother  lord stannis has the best claim to the throne  he is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy  stannis baratheon is roberts true heir  the throne is his by rights  tsk tsk sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life  it would be a shame to throw it away  cersei is no fool  she knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one  you want me to serve the woman who murdered my king  who butchered my men who crippled my son  i want you to serve the realm  tell the queen you will confess your vile treason  tell your son to lay down his sword  and proclaim joffrey as the true heir  cersei knows you as a man of honor  if you give her the peace she needs  and promise to carry her secret to your grave  i believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days  on the wall with your brother and your bastard son  you think my life is some precious thing to me  that i would trade my honor for a few more years of  of what  you grew up with actors  you learned their craft and you learned it well  but i grew up with soldiers  i learned how to die a long time ago  pity  such a pity  what of your daughters life my lord  is that a precious thing to you  its a birthday message to his grandniece walda  or so walder frey would have you think  keep shooting them down we cant risk lord walder  sending word of your movements to the lannisters  hes grandfathers bannerman we cant expect his support  expect nothing of walder frey and youll never be surprised  look  father rots in a dungeon  how long before they take his head  we need to cross the trident and we need to do it now  just march up to his gates and tell him youre crossing  weve got five times his numbers you can take the twins if you have to  not in time tywin lannister marches north as we speak  the freys have held the crossing for 600 years  and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll  have my horse saddled and ready  enter the twins alone and hell sell you to the lannis  or throw you in a dungeon or slit your throat  my father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing  whatever it took  if im going to lead this army  i cant have other men doing my bargaining for me  i agree   ill go  theon you cant  i have known lord walder since i was a girl  he would never harm me  unless there was a profit in it  what do you want  it is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years my lord  oh spare me  your boys too proud to come before me himself  what am i supposed to do with you  father you forget yourself lady stark is here  who asked you youre not lord frey yet  not until i die do i look dead to you  father please  i need lessons in courtesy from you bastard  your mother would still be a milkmaid  if i hadnt squirted you into her belly  all right you come forward  there now that ive observed the courtesies  perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths  is there somewhere we can talk  were talking right now  fine  out all of you  you too  you see that   a little flower  and her honeys all mine  im sure she will give you many sons  huh your father didnt come to the wedding  he is quite ill my lord  didnt come to the last one either  or the one before that  your family has always pissed on me   my lord i  dont deny it you know its true  the fine lord tully  would never marry any of his children to mine  im sure there were reasons why  i didnt need reasons i needed to get rid  of sons and daughters you see how they pile up  why are you here  to ask you  to open your gates my lord  so my son and his bannermen may cross the trident and be on their way  why should i let him  if you could climb your own battlements  you would see that he has  theyll be 20000 corpses when tywin lannister gets here  dont try and frighten me lady stark  your husbands in a cell beneath the red keep  and your sons got no fur to keep his balls warm  you swore an oath to my father  oh yes i said some words  and i swore oaths to the crown too if i remember right  joffreys king now which makes your boy  and his corpsestobe nothing but rebels it seems to me  if i had the sense the gods gave a fish  id hand you both over to the lannisters   why dont you  stark tully  lannister baratheon  give me one good reason  why i should waste a single thought on any of you  and engage  when does aemon think youll be able to use that hand   soon he says  good  youll be ready for this then  i thought a wolf was more appropriate for you  than a bear  so i had a new pommel made its called longclaw  works as well for a wolf as a bear i think  this is valyrian steel  it was my fathers sword  his father before him  the mormonts have carried it for five centuries  it was meant for my son jorah  he brought dishonor to our house  but he had the grace to leave the sword  before he fled from westeros  my lord you honor me but i cant  oh you can and you will  i wouldnt be standing here if it wasnt for you and your beast  a bloody dead man tried to kill me  so youll take it ill hear no more about it   is that understood  yes my lord  right now dont think this means  i approve of this nonsense  with you and alliser thorne  thats a mans sword  itll take a man to wield it  ill apologize to ser alliser tonight  no you wont  i sent him to kings landing yesterday  the hand that your wolf  tore off that things wrist  ive ordered thorne to lay it at the feet of this  boy king  that should get young joffreys attention  and it puts a thousand leagues  between you and thorne  now go and put your sword somewhere safe  and bring me my supper  yes my lord   well done  well done  you earned that snow  well done  go on lets have a look   at what  grenn the sword show us the sword  sword sword sword sword   lets have a look  piss off  get off of it piss off  come on i want to have a look at it in the light  give it here  what is it   i  look at its eyes   give it  i cant  you cant what  i im really not supposed to say  and yet you really want to say  you want to say that  there was a raven  i read the message to maester aemon  its your brother robb  what  what about him  hes heading south  to war  all his bannermen have rallied to his side theyll keep him safe  i should be there  i should be with him  if we do that theyll never get back across  well  what did he say  lord walder has granted your crossing   his men are yours as well  greatjon huh  less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing  against any who would pursue you  and what does he want in return  you will be taking on his son olyvar as your personal squire   he expects a knighthood in good time  fine fine  and  and arya  will marry his son waldron   when they both come of age  she wont be happy about that  hmmm  and  and  when the fighting is done  you will marry one of his daughters  whichever you prefer  he has a number he thinks will be suitable  i see  did you get a look at his daughters  i did  and  one was  do you consent  can i refuse  not if you want to cross  then i consent  sam said you wanted to see me  i did indeed  perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me  tell me did you ever wonder  why the men of the nights watch  take no wives and father no children  no  so they will not love  love is the death of duty  if the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose  between honor on the one hand  and those he loves on the other  what would he do  he would do whatever was right no matter what  then lord stark is one man in 10000  most of us are not so strong  what is honor  compared to a womans love  and what is duty  against the feel of a newborn son in your arms  or a brothers smile  sam told you  were all human  oh we all do our duty when theres no cost to it  honor comes easy then  yet sooner or later  in every mans life  there comes a day when it is not easy  a day when he must choose  and this is my day  is that what youre saying  oh it hurts boy oh yes   i know  you do not know  no one knows  i may be a bastard  but he is my father and robb is my brother  the gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows  they waited till i was old  what could i do when the ravens brought the news from the south  the ruin of my house the death of my family  i was helpless  blind frail  but when i heard  they had killed my brothers son  and his poor son  and the children  even the little children  who are you  my father was maekar  the first of his name  my brother aegon reigned after him  when i had refused the throne  and he was followed by his son aerys  whom they called the mad king  youre aemon targaryen  im a maester of the citadel  bound in service to castle black and the nights watch  i will not tell you to stay or go  you must make that choice yourself  and live with it for the rest of your days  as i have  drogo  sajo anni  hyah hyah  our scouts tell us  the stark host has moved south from the twins  with lord freys levies in tow  theyre a days march north  the boy may lack experience and sense  but he does have a certain mindless   provincial courage  ah  oh do continue didnt mean to interrupt  i do hope your savages are going to be of some use  otherwise weve wasted good steel on them  the great hairy one insisted he must have two battle axes  heavy black steel doublesided  shagga likes axes  when the battle commences you and your wildlings  will be in the vanguard   the vanguard  mmhmm  me and the tribesmen on the front lines  they do seem rather ferocious  ferocious last night  a moon brother stabbed a stone crow over a sausage  three stone crows seized the moon brother and opened his throat  bronn managed to keep shagga from chopping off the dead mans cock  which was fortunate but even still  ulf is demanding blood money  which shagga and gunthor refuse to pay  when soldiers lack discipline the fault lies with their commander  surely there are ways to have me killed  that would be less detrimental to the war effort  therell be no more discussion on the matter  it appears im not hungry after all  excuse me my lords  where did you find one so pretty at this hour   i took her  took her   from whom  from uh  ser whats his name  i dont know ginger cunt three tents down  and he didnt have anything to say about it  he said something  well the odds of me living long enough  for him to retaliate just dropped drastically  well be at the vanguard tomorrow  oh well  i think ill go and find myself one  who are you  who would you like me to be  what did your mother call you  shae  what did your mother call you  my mother died giving birth to me  is that why im here so we can talk about our mothers   what sort of accent is that  foreign  for  what do you want from me  what do i want from you  i want you to share my tent  i want you to pour my wine laugh at my jokes  rub my legs when theyre sore after a days ride  i want you to take no other man to bed  for as long as were together  and i want you to fuck me like its my last night in this world  which it may well be  and what do i get  safety  no one will hurt you for as long as youre mine  the pleasure of my company  which i have heard is spectacular  who told you this women you paid  and three more gold  than you can spend if you lived a thousand years  do you accept my proposal  lets start with your last night in this world  doth dothrae  ki ha hammi  ish nokitta  qanath  khaleesi  come  hes very strong  no one understands how strong he is   he will die tonight khaleesi  he cant  he cant i wont let him  even a queen doesnt have that power  we must go quickly ive heard theres a good port in asshai   i wont leave him  hes already gone khaleesi  doth  even if  even if he dies  why would i run  i am khaleesi  and my my son will be khal after drogo  this isnt westeros where men honor blood  here they only honor strength there will be fighting  after drogo dies  whoever wins that fight will be the new khal  he wont want any rivals  your boy will be plucked from your breast  and given to the dogs  i wont leave him  the wound has festered  i think you should wear your armor tonight ser  i think youre right  youve saved me once more  and now you must save him  hes beyond the healers skills  all i can do is ease his path  save him and i will free you i swear it  you must know a way  some  some magic  there is a spell  some would say death is cleaner  do it  save him  there is a price  youll have gold whatever you want  its not a matter of gold this is bloodmagic  only death pays for life  my death  no not your death khaleesi  bring me his horse  khaleesi do not do this thing   let me kill this witch  kill her and you kill your khal  this is bloodmagic it is forbidden  i am your khaleesi i tell you what is forbidden  go now   take her and leave  huhuh  take her  irriya  you must go also lady  once i begin to sing no one must enter the tent  the dead will dance here tonight  no one will enter  bring him back to me  what have you done  i have to save him  we could have been 10 miles away from here by now on the way to asshai  you would have been safe  jnith vos eo  mra qothoon vosaan  khaleesi  are you hurt   the baby  hmm  is coming   fetch the midwives  they will not come  they say she is cursed  theyll come or ill have their heads  the witch she can bring baby  i hear her say so  are you in agony my lion   no  you look like youre in agony  the fire is burning your pretty soft skin  ahhh  damn you woman are you immune to pain   just used to it  drink  lets play a new game  theres a braavosi knife game i could teach you  does it involve the potential for losing fingers   not if you win  no  no more fire games no knife games  lets do something im good at  what are you good at  i happen to be a great judge of character   this sounds like a boring game  its not  heres how it works i make a statement  about your past if im right  you drink if im wrong i drink  and no lying ill know if youre lying  i dont want to play this game  fine bronn first  your father beat you  but my mother hit harder  you killed your first man before you were 12  it was a woman  she swung an axe at me  youve been north of the wall  what brought you up there  work  and  you once loved a woman many years ago  but it turned out badly so youve never let yourself love again  oh wait thats me  your turn my mysterious foreign beauty  i dont want to play  its fun look at the fun were having  your mother was a whore  drink  all right  your father left the family when you were very young   never to return  drink  and weve established the rules about lying  drink  mmmm  you wanted a different life  you came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere  the whole shitstained world could drink off that one  so specifics  you wanted to be elsewhere but how would you get there  i dont believe the life of the silent sisters is for you  so whats a lowborn girl to do  drink   are you sure  drink  and dont talk about my mother and father ever  or i will carve your eyes from your head  my dear lady if i have offended you i apologize  my turn  fine fine  ask away  try to penetrate the enigma that is me   who were you in love with  thats not how the game works  i dont care the way the game works  our lord here used to be married   married  how did you hear that  you hear lots of things playing dice with lannister soldiers  another night perhaps  not another night this night  its not a pleasant story   or maybe i will cry  im guessing the lady and i  can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship  so  i was 16 my brother jaime and i were riding  when we heard a scream she ran out onto the road  clothes half torn off with two men on her heels  jaime scared away the men easily enough while i wrapped her in my cloak  she was too scared to send off on her own  so while jaime hunted down the rapers  i took her to the nearest inn and fed her  her name was tysha  she was a wheelwrights orphan  and she was hungry  together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine  impossible as it seems there was a time when i was unaccustomed to wine  i forgot how afraid i was around girls  how i was always waiting for them to laugh at me  or look away embarrassed  or ask me about my tall handsome brother  i forgot about everything but tysha  and somehow i found myself in her bed  for three chickens i should hope so  it didnt last long i didnt know what the hell i was doing  but she was good to me  she kissed me afterwards  and sang me a song  and by morning i was deep enough in love to ask for her hand  a few lies a few gold coins one drunken septon  and there you have it man and wife  for a fortnight anyway until the septon sobered up  and told my father  i imagine that was the end of all that  not quite  first my father had jaime tell me the truth  the girl was a whore you see  jaime had arranged the whole thing  the road the rapers all of it  he thought it was time i had a woman  after my brother confessed  my father brought in my wife  and gave her to his guards  he paid her well a silver for each man  how many whores command that kind of price  he brought me into the barracks and made me watch  by the end she had so much silver  that the coins were slipping through her fingers  and rolling onto the floor  i would have killed the man who did that to me  you should have known she was a whore  really  i was 16 drunk and in love  a girl who was almost raped  doesnt invite another man into her bed two hours later  as i said i was young and stupid  you are still young and stupid  hyah  what is it what do you want  youre sleeping through the war   what  they stole a nights march on us  theyre a mile north   get my squire  you dont have a squire  if i die weep for me  youll be dead how will you know  ill know  watch out move  out of the way   move aside   neighs  stay low  stay low  if youre lucky no one will notice you  i was born lucky  tribesmen of the vale  gather round  stone crows  black ears burned men   moon brothers  man and painted dogs  and painted dogs  your dominion over the vale begins now  onward to claim what is yours  half man half man  half man half man  half man half man

more use to us alive than dead  take him away and put him in irons  we could end this war right now boy  save thousands of lives  you fight for the starks i fight for the lannisters  swords or lances teeth nails choose your weapons  and lets end this here and now  if we do it your way kingslayer  youd win  were not doing it your way  come on pretty man  i sent 2000 men to their graves today  the bards will sing songs of their sacrifice  aye but the dead wont hear them  one victory does not make us conquerors  did we free my father  did we rescue my sisters from the queen  did we free the north from those who want us on our knees  this war is far from over  could i have one  a lemon one or any of them  three coppers  how about a nice fat pigeon  piss off now go on  do you have any
