                   may the warrior grant him courage  may the smith him grant him strengths times  that he might bear this heavy burden  and may the crone  she that knows the fate of all men  show him the path he must walk  and guide him through the dark places that lie ahead  in the light of the seven i now proclaim tommen  of the house baratheon first of his name  king of the andals and the first men  and lord of the seven kingdoms  long may he reign  long may he reign  special day  your grace  your grace   your grace  your grace  your grace  there he is  long may he reign  long may he reign  he sits the throne like he was born to it  yes he wasnt though was he  no he wasnt  you still mourn for joffrey  he was my husband my king  he would have been your nightmare  your grace i feel  you knew exactly what he was  i did too  you never love anything in the world  the way you love your first child  doesnt matter what they do  and what he did it shocked me  do you think im easily shocked  no  the things he did shocked me  hes only a boy  a good boy a decent boy  he always has been  who was the last decent king i wonder  he could be the first man who sits on that throne  in 50 years to actually deserve it  it would be some consolation wouldnt it  for all the horror that put him there  he will need help  if hes going to rule well  he has you  a mother is not enough  youre still interested in being queen i take it  oh  after all thats happened  it sounds strange i know but i am  i havent even given any thought to it  what comes next  it would be a great honor of course  but i will have to speak to my father about it  yes speak to your father  ill speak to mine  we may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon  i wont even know what to call you  sister  or mother  hmm  king joffrey baratheon is dead  murdered at his own wedding  and we have taken the meereenese navy your grace  the second sons took the meereenese navy  who told you to take the navy  no one  so why did you do it  i heard you liked ships  how many ships   how many men can they carry  not counting sailors  would that be enough to take kings landing  the lannisters have more  theyve been fighting joffreys wars for years  theyre tired dispersed  and now their king is dead   sailing into blackwater bay  and storming the gates without warning  its hard to say it could be enough  but were not fighting to make you queen of kings landing  cant conquer westeros  the old houses will flock to our queen  when she crosses the narrow sea  the old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win  as they always have  theres other news  from yunkai  without the unsullied to enforce your rule  the wise masters have retaken control of the city  theyve reenslaved the freedmen who stayed behind  and sworn to take revenge against you  and in astapor  the council you installed to rule over the city  has been overthrown by a butcher named cleon  whos declared himself his imperial majesty  please leave me  not you jorah  it appears my liberation of slavers bay  isnt going quite as planned  you could sail for westeros  and leave it all behind  a boy sits on the iron throne  a boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it  theyve never been more vulnerable  you counseled me against rashness once in qarth  i didnt listen  that all worked out well  how can i rule seven kingdoms  if i cant control slavers bay  why should anyone trust me  why should anyone follow me  youre a targaryen  youre the mother of dragons  i need to be more than that  i will not let those i have freed slide back into chains  i will not sail for westeros  what then  i will do what queens do  i will rule  pull up your hood  a memorable shade  but how would they know  you know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most  ones about rich girls theyll never meet  is this the only way into the eyrie  the mountains are impassable  if you want to get to the eyrie  you need to go through the bloody gate  it doesnt matter how large your army is  if you attack this gate you do it on this road  three men abreast  and get slaughtered like goats  the first lords of the vale didnt have much  but they had these mountains  and they knew how to use them  and the fortress they built here has never been overcome  not once in 1000 years  know your strengths use them wisely  and one man can be worth 10000  who would pass the bloody gate  lord petyr baelish and his niece alayne  stand to   stand to  stand to  welcome back lord baelish  uncle petyr  my lord  oh  i have brought you a gift  lord baelish  my lady  look what uncle petyr brought me  a beautiful gift for a beautiful boy  its a pleasure to make your acquaintance lady arryn  my name is al  oh do take down that hood child  dont you think know who you are  you think id let my intended  leave the eyrie on urgent business  without knowing what that business was  i let him go so he could bring you here to me  my flesh and blood  its wonderful to meet you aunt lysa  you mustnt call me that in front of anyone else  of course i understand  no one can know youre here  it would put us in a very precarious position  i would never say a thing  the lannisters want to destroy us  theyve been trying for years  now they know what it feels like  mummy said they killed your mother  and they chopped off your brothers head  they did and my fathers  they killed my father too with poison  i wanted to make the little lannister baby man fly  but mother said i couldnt  make him fly  through the moon door  and on top of everything else  they made you marry that filthy troll  they did they made us both  lord tyrion didnt want to  i dont believe that for a moment  did he force himself on you  no   we never good  robin this is your cousin sansa  but youre not to call her sansa in front of anyone  but uncle petyr and myself do you understand  sansa this is my son robin  its a pleasure to meet you robin  robin show sansa to her chamber  take the back stairs  go well speak soon  what took you so long  arranging for the ascension of king tommen i  extricating sansa getting her here alive  shes here  weve spent more than enough time on her for one evening  lets get married tonight  ought we not  inform the lords of the vale about the ceremony  theres only one lord of the vale  the others can all hang  lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards  the moment my husband died trying to get their claws in me  i do think that we could wait until  im done waiting petyr  we had our wedding night many years ago  or dont you remember  like it was yesterday  what wife would do for you the things ive done for you  what wife would trust you the way ive trusted you  when you gave me those drops  and told me to pour them into jons wine  my husbands wine  when you told me to write a letter to cat  telling her it was the lannisters  the deed is done  faded into nothing  only speaking of it can make it real  tonight it is then  let me bathe and dress for the occasion  once im presentable ill call on the septon immediately  im warning you  im going to scream when my husband makes love to me  im going to scream so loud  theyll hear me clear across the narrow sea  when will the wedding take place in your mind  as soon as decency permits  after weve allowed tommen th appropriate time to mourn his brother  and margaery to mourn her husband   a fortnight  that seems reasonable  no jugglers no jousting dwarves  no 77course meals  and your wedding to loras  shortly after tommens   shortly  a fortnight  i know you dont like them  i didnt like your husband  used to pat me on the back a lot  i didnt trust him  we had that in common  you dont need to make formal alliances with people you trust  then whom can we trust  ourselves alone  the tyrells  are our only true rivals  in terms of resources  and we need them on our side  robert wasnt particularly rich  robert had me funding him  wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth  i suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one  do you know how much gold was mined in the westerlands this past year  havent a clue  go on your best guess  pounds tons ounces  doesnt matter the answer is the same  that cant be  our last working mine ran dry three years ago  then how do we pay for anything  the crown owes the iron bank of braavos  a tremendous amount of money  how much  a tremendous amount  there must be someone at the iron bank  you can speak to come to some arrangement  the iron bank is the iron bank  there is no someone  someone does work there it is comprised of people  and a temple is comprised of stones  one stone crumbles and another takes its place  and the temple holds its form for 1000 years or more  thats what the iron bank is a temple  we all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it  you cant run from them you cant cheat them  you cant sway them with excuses  if you owe them money and you dont want to crumble yourself  you pay it back  vesting the tyrells in the own  will help a great deal in this respect  its for the good of the family i understand that  im not sure my brothers do  i know youre building a strong case against tyrion  and as a mother that is your right  but as a judge i cannot discuss the trial with you  i respect that  we dont need to discuss it  the lannister legacy is the only thing that matters  youve started wars to protect this family  turned your back on jaime  for refusing to contribute to its future  what does tyrion deserve  for lighting that future on fire  joffrey  cersei  walder frey  meryn trant  tywin lannister  the red woman  beric dondarrion  thoros of myr  ilyn payne  the mountain  would you shut up  i cant sleep until i say the names  the names of every fucking person in westeros  only the ones im going to kill  hates as good a thing as any to keep a person going  better than most  we come across my brother  maybe we can both cross a name off our list  if he were here

your handsome arrogant cruel uncle brandon  he almost killed petyr in a duel  and your mother loved him anyway  and now petyr is risking his life to save you  the daughter of a woman who didnt love
