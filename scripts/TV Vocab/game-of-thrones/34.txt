                 my name  is grey worm  i come from  the summer ills  isles  summer isles  summer isles  i am from an island called naath  when they took you  when did they take me  i was five years old  you remember your home  i remember when they rowed us away from shore  how white the beaches were  how tall the trees  and i remember my village burning  smoke rising into the sky  do you remember your home  unsullied  always unsullied  before unsullied nothing  thats not true  perhaps one day you will return to the summer isles  i dont want return  kill the masters  kill the masters  how are the lessons coming  very well your grace  missandei is teacher good my queen  youll have to continue later  its time                                                                    mhysa mhysa mhysa  mhysa mhysa mhysa mhysa  mhysa mhysa  remind me ser jorah  how many children did the great masters nail to mileposts   yes that was it  your grace may i have a word  the city is yours  all these people theyre your subjects now  sometimes it is better to answer injustice  with mercy  i will answer injustice with justice  what the hell was that  that was me knocking your ass to the dirt  with your own hand  youre a rare talent  when youre fighting cripples anyway  you learned to fight like a good little boy  ill bet that thrust through the mad kings back was pretty as a picture  you want to fight pretty or you want to win  you talk to my brother this way  all the time  he got used to it  do you think he did it  no  oh he hated the little twat sure  but who didnt  and poisons not his style  or murder for that matter  you want to know for sure why dont you ask him  you havent been to see him yet eh  were done for today  your brother ever tell you how i came into his service  you stood for him in his trial by combat at the eyrie  aye  but only when lady arryn demanded  the trial take place that day  you were his first choice  he named you for his champion  because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him  you gonna fight for him now  to tell you the truth this isnt so bad  four walls a pot to piss in  i was chained to a wooden post  covered in my own shit for months  is that supposed to make me feel better  maybe a bit  im sorry i didnt come sooner  its complicated yes   so how is our sister  how do you think  her son died in her arms  her son  dont  you know whats coming  my trial for regicide yes i know  i know the whole bloody country thinks im guilty  i know that one of my three judges  has wished me dead more times than i can count  and that judge is my father  as for cersei  well shes probably working on a way  to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed  now that you mention it she did ask  so should i turn around and close my eyes  depends  did you do it  the kingslayer brothers  you like it i like it  youre really asking if i killed your son  are you really asking if id kill my brother  how can i help you  well you could set me free  you know i cant  then theres really nothing else to say  what do you want me to do kill the guards  sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart  im the lord commander of the kingsguard  sorry id forgotten  id hate for you to do something inappropriate  inappropriate  youre accused of killing the king freeing you is treason  except i didnt do it  which is why were having a trial  a trial  if the killer threw himself before the iron throne  confessed to his crimes and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt  it wouldnt matter to cersei  she wont rest until my heads on a spike  not just yours  shes offering a knighthood to whomever finds sansa stark  sansa couldnt have done this  she had more reason than anyone in the seven kingdoms  do you think its a coincidence she disappeared the same night joffrey died  no but  sansas not a killer  not yet anyway  where are you taking me  im getting married to your aunt lysa  shes waiting for us at the eyrie  youll be safe there  did you kill joffrey  did i kill joffrey  ive been in the vale for weeks  i know it was you  and who helped me with this conspiracy  well there was ser dontos  you used him to get me out of kings landing  but you would never trust him to kill the king   why not  because youre too smart to trust a drunk  then perhaps it was your husband  no  how do you know  i just do  youre right  he wasnt involved in joffreys death  but you were  do you remember that lovely necklace dontos gave you  i dont suppose you noticed that a stone was missing  after the feast  the poison  i dont understand  the lannisters gave you wealth power  joffrey made you the lord of harrenhal  a man with no motive is a man no one suspects  always keep your foes confused  if they dont know who you are or what you want  they cant know what you plan to do next  i dont believe you  if they catch you theyll put your head on a spike  just like my fathers  youd risk that just to confuse them  so many men they risk so little  they spend their lives avoiding danger  and then they die  id risk everything to get what i want  and what do you want  everything  my friendship with the lannisters was productive  but joffrey  a vicious boy with a crown on his head  is not a reliable ally  and who could trust a friend like that  who could trust you  i dont want friends like me  my new friends are predictable  very reasonable people  as for what happened to joffrey  well that was something my new friends wanted very badly  nothing like a thoughtful gift  to make a new friendship grow strong  i cant believe youre going  leaving me alone here with these people  the time has come my dear  theres nothing more tedious than a trial  except perhaps these gardens  if i have to take one more leisurely stroll  through these gardens ill fling myself from the cliffs  have you been to see tommen yet  no  have they even agreed to the match  no one tells me anything  i wasnt originally meant to marry your grandfather luthor you know  he was engaged to my sister  your greataunt viola  i was to be given to some targaryen or other  marrying a targaryen was all the rage back then  but the moment i saw my intended  with his twitchy little ferrets face  and ludicrous silver hair  i knew he wouldnt do  so the evening  before luthor was to propose to my sister  i got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson  and happened upon his chamber   how absentminded of me  mmhmm  the following morning luthor never made it down the stairs  to propose to my sister cause the boy couldnt bloody walk  and once he could the only thing he wanted  was what id given him the night before  i was good  i was very very good  you are even better  but you need to act quickly  cersei may be vicious but shes not stupid  shell turn the boy against you as soon as she can  and by the time youre married itll be too late  luckily for you the queen regent  is rather distracted at the moment  mourning her dear departed boy  accusing her brother of his murder  which he didnt commit  well he could have done  he could have done but he didnt   you dont know grandmother  but i do know  you dont think id let you marry that beast do you  what i dont understand  shh dont you worry yourself about all that  you just do what needs to be done  bring it through  and again  very nice good  a lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand  first thing you want to do  is disarm them to try and even the odds  lets see what you can do  olly you just watch for now  i can fight  have you ever held a sword before  i was the best archer in our hamlet  i was  i believe you  well go hunting for rabbits one day  right now watch and learn  you two  take it slow try and disarm each other  you know how to fight  you could have gone easier on him  he wouldnt have learned anything that way  lord snow  what do you think youre doing  grenn and i were helping them  grenns a ranger youre a steward  maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch  but i didnt  someone has to train them  and that someone isnt you  go find a chamber pot to empty  go on do it  you traitors bastard  give me an excuse  mormonts not here to protect you now  get back to work  now  i said now  the bastards wellliked youre not  you think i care if they like me were at war  for now  but you cant be acting commander forever  there will be a choosing  the old maester will insist on it  you might reconsider  his request to march on crasters  let the mutineers take care of snow  or you might be taking orders from him  the rest of your life  a bastard eh  took you for highborn  my father was highborn  my mother wasnt  names locke  jon snow  you fight well  what brought you up here  a sense of duty  i wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm  i was a game warden in the stormlands  fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids  i was stupid enough to get caught  chose the wall over losing my hand  figured i wouldnt have to suck up to any highborn cunts here  come on get on with it  what are you waiting for summer  guess i was wrong  you sent for me your grace  your grace  how formal of you  how many kingsguards are posted outside tommens door  ser boros is on duty tonight   tomorrow i believe   so one  you have one man guarding the future king  i promise you tommens safe  were protecting him  the way you protected joffrey  why did catelyn stark set you free   what  ive been wondering for months  ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital  why did she set you free  you know why shed hoped id send her daughters back to her  she hoped or did you promise  i swore by all the gods  that if her daughters were alive id return them to her  so you made a sacred vow to the enemy  i wanted to get back to you  should i have told her to fuck off  you didnt mean it then  you have no loyalty to catelyn stark  catelyn starks dead  so if i told you to leave the capital right now and find sansa  if i told you to find that murderous little bitch  and bring me her head  would you do it  i know you went to see tyrion  that creature who murdered our son  i had to see him  i had to know for myself  and  he didnt do it cersei  youve always pitied him  our poor little brother  abused by the world  despised by his father and sister  hed kill us all if he could  i want four men at tommens door day and night  that will be all lord commander  ser pounce  how did you get past the kingsguard  kingsguard  i dont think youre supposed to be here  mother doesnt allow me to have visitors at night  im not a visitor your grace  word has it im to be your bride  did you know that people in arranged marriages  often never meet until their wedding day  before we decide to spend our lives together  we ought to get to know one another  dont you think  yes  but if my mother found out  it can be our secret hmm  if were going to be man and wife  well have a few secrets from her i hope  so your grace  yes  tell me a secret  hello arent you a proper fellow  thats ser pounce  very handsome  joffrey didnt like him  he threatened to skin him alive  and mix his innards up in my food  so i wouldnt know i was eating him  thats very cruel  you dont strike me as cruel  no  i dont think i am  thats a relief  because you know what happens when we marry  we say our vows in front of the high septon  and after the ceremony theres a feast  when we marry i become yours  forever  its getting late  i should go  may i come and visit you again  all right then  remember  our little secret  ser jaime lannister  knighted and named to the kingsguard in his 16th year  at the sack of kings landing  murdered his king aerys ii  pardoned by robert baratheon  thereafter known as the kingslayer  its the duty of the lord commander to fill those pages  and theres still room left on mine  valyrian steel  mmm  its yours  i cant accept this  it was reforged from ned starks sword  youll use it to defend ned starks daughter  you swore an oath to return the stark girls to their mother  lady starks dead  aryas probably dead too  but theres still a chance to find sansa and get her somewhere safe  ive got something else for you  i hope i got your measurements right  ill find her  for lady catelyn  and for you  i almost forgot  i have one more gift  i dont need a squire  of course you do  hell slow me down  my brother owes him a debt hes not safe here  youre keeping him from harm its chivalry  i wont slow you down ser  my lady  i promise ill serve you well  see hes a good lad youll get along  compliments of lord tyrion  his axe from the blackwater  what are you waiting for a kiss  ready the ladys horse  they say the best swords have names  any ideas  oathkeeper  goodbye brienne  come on move  i should never have taken her away   she wasnt safe here  shes not safe out there  i should have known  you told us there were wildlings south of the wall  if theyre raiding the smaller villages moles town could be next   castle black could be next  i should go back for gilly  we have orders no ones to leave the castle  i remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help robb  and i remember who came after me and brought me home  i know how hard it is sam believe me  when you told me about bran going beyond the wall  all i could think about was getting my strength back so i could go and find him  i wish i could have convinced him to come back with me  i tried really i did  how fast could they travel  a crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton  i dont know  theyd pass wildling villages  they could try to find shelter at one of them  the wildlings have joined up with mance  every village or sheltered place will be deserted  except  crasters  you think bran might have found  snow  i dont mean to interrupt  thorne wants to see you  your foray to crasters keep  ill sanction it  but i wont order anyone to go with you  volunteers only  thank you ser alliser  ahem brothers  im going beyond the wall to crasters keep  im going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them  im asking for volunteers to come with me  theres 60 miles of wilderness between here and crasters  and mance rayder has an army bearing down on us  but we have to do this  our survival may depend on  us getting to these mutineers before mance does  they know the wall they know our defenses  if mance learns what they know were lost  but if thats not enough  then consider this  if the nights watch are truly brothers  then lord commander mormont was our father  he lived and died for the watch  and he was betrayed by his own men  stabbed in the back by cowards  he deserved far better  all we can give him now is justice  who will join me  i cant let a recruit come north of the wall  then let me say my vows  if its a fight youre heading for then you need men who know how  thank you brothers  no dont  dont please  please dont ow  youre hurting me  karl tanner from gin alley  drinking wine from the skull  of jeor fucking mormont  any command for us lord commander  whats that  fuck em till theyre dead  did you hear that
