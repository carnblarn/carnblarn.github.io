lord took them did you see  lord florent was your brother by law  he was an infidel  he worshipped the gods of his fathers  and their fathers before him  they were the gods of your fathers too  i ordered him to tear down his idols  he disobeyed  how many ships did he bring to your cause  how many men  a good deal more than you  did you see ser davos  theyre with our lord now  their sins all burned away did you see  im sure theyre more than grateful my queen  meats off  our larders are almost empty  serve fish then were on an island  you hate fish  i hate a good many things but i suffer them all the same  when storms end was under siege and i was starving  stannis boiled soup for me from books  the binding glue is made from horses  one morning he shot two seagulls on the beach  ive never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull   do you remember  of course i remember  have you ever known true hunger my lady  its all i knew when i was a child  until you found the lord of light  until he found me  i fear for our daughters soul  every mother should fear for her childs soul   shes a stubborn little beast  shes a child  you barely know her  you think shes sweet because she smiles when you visit  shes sullen and stubborn and sinful  why else would the lord of light have seen fit to mark her face  she needs the rod  shes my daughter you will not strike her  as you command  perhaps the lady melisandre could speak with her  come in  were you sleeping princess  did you watch the ceremony on the beach  i heard it  and it frightened you  ser axel was my uncle  he was always kind to me  theyre in a better place now princess  the fire cleansed them of the sins of the world  but they screamed  women scream when they give birth  afterward they are filled with joy  afterward they arent ash and bone  you have so many questions dont you  so did i when i was a child  i was much like you  only i wasnt a princess  and you didnt have this  no  but i suffered in other ways sweet girl believe me  what do you know of the gods  i read the sevenpointed star  lies and fables  septons speak of seven gods  there are but two  a god of light and love and joy  and a god of darkness evil and fear  eternally at war  there are no seven heavens and no seven hells  theres only one hell princess  the one we live in now  hodor  why did you wake me  youve been gone for hours  i was hungry  were all hungry  i was just eating  summer was eating  your body cant live on the food your wolf consumes  spending too much time in summers skin is dangerous  youre not a direwolf bran  must be glorious though  to run to leap to hunt  to be whole  i know thats tempting  but if youre trapped in summer for too long  youll forget what it was to be human  youd forget us bran  youd forget your mother and father  youd forget your brothers and sisters  youd forget winterfell  youd forget you  and if we lose you we lose everything  hodor take me to the tree  look for me  beneath the tree  he saw us  north  i know where we have to go  let it be known that margaery of house tyrell  and joffrey of the houses lannister and baratheon  are one heart one flesh one soul  cursed be he  who would seek to tear them asunder  with this kiss i pledge my love  we have a new queen  better her than you   bit much wouldnt you say  it feels proportionate   proportionate to what  the expected extravagance  people who spend their money on this sort of nonsense  tend not to have it for long  you ought to try enjoying something before you die  you might find it suits you  not now mace lord tywin and i are speaking  anyway i dont know what youre complaining about  im paying my share  shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies  to commemorate your generosity  no your heartfelt thankyou is its own reward  i would imagine id be hearing it again before long  wars are rather expensive  the iron bank will have its due  how they love to remind everyone  almost as much as you lannisters with your debts  im not worried about the iron bank  we both know youre smarter than that  come tywin let us celebrate young love  all taken care of   you saw her board the ship  aye shes on it  you saw the ship sail away  no one knows shes there but you me and varys  how do you know  because if someone follows me without an invitation  im the last person they ever follow  theres someone following you  shes gone  i know you dont want to believe it but she is  now go drink till it feels like you did the right thing  hello   hello  not you  you look exquisite child  the wind has been at you though  i havent had the opportunity to tell you  how sorry i was to hear about your brother  war is war but killing a man at a wedding  horrid  what sort of monster would do such a thing  as if men need more reasons to fear marriage  my lady my lady  lord tyrion you see not as bad as all that  perhaps if your pauper husband  were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes  he might be able to afford to bring you to highgarden for a visit  now that peace has come and all is right with the world  it would do you good to see some of it  you must excuse me its time i ate  some of this food i paid for  a coat of gold   or a coat of red   a lion still has claws   and mine my lord   very good very good off you go  my love why dont we make the announcement  everyone  the queen would like to say a few words  we are so fortunate  to enjoy this marvelous food and drink  not all among us are so lucky  to thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end  king joffrey has decreed that the leftovers  from our feast be given to the poorest in his city  youre an example to us all  ser jaime im very sorry  ser loras its quite all right  your sister looks very beautiful  as does yours  so looking forward to your wedding  yes very much  our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect  they certainly are  perhaps they should get married  if you were to marry cersei  shed murder you in your sleep  if you somehow managed to put a child in her first  shed murder him too  long before he drew his first breath  luckily for you none of this will happen  because youll never marry her  and neither will you  your grace my king   my queen  lady brienne  so good of you to come  im no lady your grace  did you just bow  apologies your grace  i never did master the curtsy  youre the one who put a sword through renly baratheon  thats not true my love brienne had nothing to do with it  a shame  id knight the man that put an end to that deviants life  i just wanted to congratulate you both  and wish you good fortune  the country has been at war too long  i hope your reign is long and peaceful   yes yes  thank you  i hope we see more of you  lady brienne  youre lord selwyn tarths daughter  that makes you a lady whether you want to be or not  as you say your grace  i owe you my gratitude  you returned my brother safely to kings landing  in truth he rescued me your grace  more than once  did he  havent heard that story before  not such a fascinating story im afraid  im sure you have many fascinating stories  sworn to renly baratheon sworn to catelyn stark and now my brother  must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next  serving whichever lord or lady you fancy  i dont serve your brother your grace  but you love him  your grace  no no come to my chambers and i will examine you personally   shell do no such thing  oh your grace  yes well this young lady sought my advice  you should see qyburn hes quite good   your grace  qyburn deplorable man  brought shame on the citadel with his repugnant experiments  more repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girls thighs  your grace i am a man of learning  my little brother had you sent to the black cells when you annoyed him  what do you think i could do to you if you annoyed me  i never meant to annoy anyone  but you are you annoy me right now  every breath you draw in my presence annoys me  so heres what i want you to do  i want you to leave my presence  leave this wedding right now  go to the kitchens and instruct them  that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels  your grace queen margaery  the queen is telling you  the leftovers will feed the dogs  or you will  a gold dragon to whoever knocks my fools hat off  youre in rather a good mood   i suppose i am  i wont ask why   small pleasures  your grace lord tywin  prince oberyn  i dont believe you have met ellaria  this is the lord hand tywin lannister  and cersei lannister the queen regent  i suppose it is former queen regent now  lord hand and lady cersei   ellaria sand  my lord my lady  charmed  cant say ive ever met a sand before  we are everywhere in dorne  i have 10000 brothers and sisters  bastards are born of passion arent they  we dont despise them in dorne  no how tolerant of you  i expect it is a relief lady cersei  giving up your regal responsibilities  wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked  i suppose youll never know prince oberyn  its a shame your older brother couldnt attend the wedding  please give him our regards  with any luck the gout will abate  with time and he will be able to walk again  they call it the rich mans disease  a wonder you dont have it  noblemen in my part of the country  dont enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in dorne  people everywhere have their differences  in some places the highborn frown upon those of low birth  in other places the rape and murder of women and children  is considered distasteful  what a fortunate thing for you former queen regent  that your daughter myrcella has been sent  to live in the latter sort of place  everyone silence clear the floor  theres been too much amusement here today  a royal wedding is not an amusement  a royal wedding is history  the time has come for all of us  to contemplate our history  my lords  my ladies  i give you  king joffrey  renly

my face  i think you should fight him  this was but a poor imitation  of your own bravery on the field of battle  i speak as a firsthand witness  climb down from the high table  with your new valyrian sword  and show everyone how a true king wins his throne  be careful though  this one is clearly mad with lust  it would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue  hours before his wedding night  a fine vintage  shame that it spilled  it did not spill  my love come back to me  its time for my fathers toast  well how does he expect me to toast without wine  uncle you can be my cupbearer  seeing
