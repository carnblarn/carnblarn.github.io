third  i will also invite you to sit on the small council  i never realized you had such respect for dorne  what good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love  you can avenge them  you really believe tyrion murdered your son  youre still interested in being queen i take it  it would be a great honor  but i will have to speak to my father about it  i will speak to mine  you started wars to protect this familys future  tyrion deserves for lighting our future to fire  what kind of knight beats a helpless girl  the kind who serves his king  the next time ser meryn speaks kill him  how many hands have you betrayed pycelle   i am loyal servant  throw him in one of the black cells  oh no no no no  there are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat  the king wont give you any honors but we will not forget  the city is yours all these people are your subjects now  sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy  i will answer injustice with justice  find a special gift  theons favorite toy  he cried when i took it away from him  im going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet  and im going to bring him home  we need to look east for ships and men   soldiers win wars  we dont have any gold  im running out of time ser davos which means youre running out of time   your grace if youd like to sit im sure that  weve been here since midday  easterners have a difference sense of time ive often found  once i was waiting for salladhor saan here in braavos  together we were going to run  three shiploads of the finest  welcome to the iron bank  please sit  what can we do for you lord stannis  this is stannis of the house baratheon  king of the andals and the first men  lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm  the iron throne is currently occupied  by tommen of the house baratheon  king of the andals and the first men  lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm  he shares no blood with me  he is a bastard born of incest  as was his brother before him  yes we have heard this story  its not a story its the truth  the kings grandfather tells a different story  a story about a jealous uncle  whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king  cost the seven kingdoms dearly in blood and gold  gold you loaned him  and you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold  more than any man living  across the narrow sea your books are filled  with words like usurper and madman  and blood right  here our books are filled with numbers  we prefer the stories they tell  more plain  less open to interpretation  how many fighting men remain loyal to you   and how many ships do you have  the ones still afloat ser davos  not at the bottom of blackwater bay   and how much wheat and barley and beef  and pork do you produce on dragonstone  to feed your 4000 men on your 32 ships  none  you can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up  to a happy ending from our perspective  im afraid we must respectfully  decline your request  but we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit  my lord  im not a lord ser davos seaworth  you would not be either here  in braavos  thieves are not rewarded with titles  well strictly speaking i didnt do the thieving  that would be the pirates  i just moved what they stole from one place to another  this is the payment that was demanded  by king stannis for my crimes  i consider it an honest accounting  hes an honest man and hes your best chance  to get back the money youve sunk into westeros  which is a lot i imagine wars are expensive  the war is over  as long as stannis lives the war is not over  whos the real power in kings landing   ser davos  humor me    tywin lannister  how old is tywin lannister   67  67 and when he dies whos in

do you back  that is a problem for another time  begging your pardon i think its a problem for now  theres only one reliable leader left in westeros  stannis  hes got the birthright  hes in his prime  hes a tried and tested battle commander  and he doesnt just talk about paying people back  he does it  the lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way  the captain shouts to his first mate  bring me my red shirt  the first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on  and when the pirates try to board  the brave captain leads his men to victory  a few days later the lookout screams  two pirate ships  the crew is shivering like scared mice  but the courageous captain hollers  bring me my red shirt  after the battle the first mate asks  captain why do you call for your red shirt before battle  the captain replies  so that if i am stabbed you will not see me bleed  the next morning the lookout screams  10 pirate ships  we are surrounded  the crew goes silent  they all look to their brave captain  waiting for his usual command  calm as ever the captain bellows  bring me my brown pants  you think they ever met a pirate who didnt tell them that joke  davos  i heard you were rotting

 he says he prayed for your victory against the slave masters  i thank him for his prayers  it was your dragons he says  they came this morning for his flock  he hopes he has not offended your grace  but now he has nothing  tell this man i am sorry for his hardship  i cannot bring back his goats  but i will see he is paid their value three times over  send the next one in      queen daenerys  tales of your beauty were not exaggerated  i thank you  mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in meereen  then it is my honor to receive you  my father one of meereens most respected  and beloved citizens oversaw the restoration  and maintenance of its greatest landmarks  this pyramid included  for that he has my gratitude  i should be honored to meet him  you have your grace  you crucified him  i pray youll never live to see  a member of your family treated so cruelly  your father crucified innocent children  my father spoke out against crucifying those children  he decried it as a criminal act but was overruled  is it justice to answer one crime with another  i am sorry you no longer have a father  but my treatment of the masters was no crime  youd be wise to remember that  whats done is done  you are the queen and i am a servant of meereen  a servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated  and what traditions do you speak of  the tradition of funeral rite  proper burial in the temple of the graces  my father and 162 noble meereenese  are still nailed to those posts  carrion for vultures rotting in the sun  your grace i ask that you order these men taken down  so that they might receive proper burials  and what of the slave children these noble meereenese crucified  they were rotting in the sun as well  would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial  your grace i cannot defend the actions of the masters  i can only speak to you as a son who loved his father  let me take his body down  let me have him brought to the temple  and buried with dignity  so that he might find peace in the next world  bury your father hizdahr zo loraq  thank you my queen  how many more  there are 212 supplicants waiting your grace   send the next one in  these meetings arent always going to be this early are they  i was up late last night  so does this mean i am a master of something now  coins ships  lord tywin and i already determined  that i shall be the master of ships long before you  lord tywin its a great honor  to have been granted a seat on this council i  the trial begins this afternoon  we only have the morning for affairs of state  shall we begin  sandor clegane has been spotted  in the riverlands my lord  a coward and a traitor  my birds tell me the hound slaughtered five of our soldiers  i believe the phrase fuck the king was uttered  disgraceful  what would it take to make the common soldier  stupid enough to try his luck with the hound  seems a generous bounty  make it 100 what else  more whispers from the east my lord  the targaryen girl  daenerys has taken up residence in meereen  she has conquered the city and rules as its queen  conquered with what  she commands an army of unsullied my queen  some 8000 strong  she has a company of sellswords  the second sons  she has two knights advising her  jorah mormont and barristan selmy  and she has three dragons  baby dragons  larger every year your grace  mormont is spying on her for us  no longer he appears to be fully devoted to her  as for ser barristan it would seem  he took his dismissal from the kingsguard  a bit harder than anticipated  hes an old man  he wasnt fit to protect my son  joffrey didnt die on his watch  dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid  dont tell me youre worried about a child halfway across the world  a child with two seasoned warriors counseling her  and a powerful army at her back your grace  lord varys is right  i have been to essos and seen the unsullied firsthand  they are very impressive on the battlefield  less so in the bedroom  dragons havent won a war in 300 years  armies win them all the time  she must be dealt with  how my lord  by force  eventually if it comes to that  can your little birds find their way into meereen  most certainly my lord hand  mmm lord tyrell be a good man  fetch my quill and paper  prince oberyn  lord varys  only varys im not actually a nobleman  no one is under obligation to call me lord  and yet everyone does  you seem quite knowledgeable about the unsullied  did you spend much time in essos  five years  may i ask why  tis a big and beautiful world  most of us live and die  in the same corner where we were born  and never get to see any of it  i dont want to be most of us  most of us arent princes  you are from essos  where lys  i have an ear for accents  ive lost my accent entirely  i have an ear for that as well  how did you get here  its a long story  one you dont like telling people  people i trust  my paramour ellaria she would find you very interesting  you should come to the brothel and meet her  we brought our own wine not the swill they serve here  we have some lovely boys on retainer but  you did like boys before  really  girls hmm  i hope you wont be offended when i say i never would have guessed  not at all  but i was never interested in girls either   what then   nothing  everybody is interested in something  not me  when i see what desire does to people  what its done to this country  i am very glad to have no part in it  besides the absence of desire  leaves one free to pursue other things  such as  let me guess ive been pardoned  really  fathers orders  well we mustnt disappoint father  kingslayer  i tommen of the house baratheon  first of my name  king of the andals and the first men  and lord of the seven kingdoms  do hereby recuse myself from this trial  tywin of the house lannister hand of the king  protector of the realm will sit as judge in my stead  and with him prince oberyn of the house martell  and lord mace of the house tyrell  and if found guilty  may the gods punish the accused  tyrion of the house lannister  you stand accused by the queen regent of regicide  did you kill king joffrey  no  did your wife the lady sansa  not that i know of  how would you say he died then  choked on his pigeon pie  so you would blame the bakers  or the pigeons just leave me out of it  the crown may call its first witness  once wed got king joffrey safely away  from the mob the imp rounded on him  he slapped the king across the face  and called him a vicious idiot and a fool  it wasnt the first time the imp threatened joffrey  right here in this throne room  he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit  compared his grace to the mad king  and suggested hed meet the same fate  and when i spoke in the kings defense  he threatened to have me killed  oh why dont you tell them what joffrey was doing   silence  pointing a loaded crossbow at sansa stark  while you tore at her clothes and beat her  silence  you will not speak unless called upon  youre dismissed ser meryn  basilisk venom  widows blood  wolfsbane  essence of nightshade  sweetsleep  tears of lys  demons dance  blind eye  i think you have made your point grand maester  you have a lot of poison in your store  had prince oberyn  my stores were plundered  by whom  by the accused tyrion lannister  after he had me wrongfully imprisoned  grand maester  you examined king joffreys corpse  was it without question poison that killed him  without question  this was found on the body of dontos hollard  the kings fool  he was last seen spiriting sansa stark  the wife of the accused away from the feast  she wore this necklace  the day of the wedding  residue of a most rare  and terrible poison was found inside  was this one of the poisons stolen from your store  it was the strangler  a poison few in the seven kingdoms possess  and used to strike down the most noble child  the gods ever put on this good earth  i will hurt you for this  a day will come when you think you are safe and happy  and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth  and you will know the debt is paid  your own brother said this to you  shortly before the battle of blackwater bay  i confronted him about his plans to put joffrey on the front lines  as it turned out when the attack came  joff insisted on remaining at the battlements  he believed his presence would inspire the troops  tyrion said  and you will know the debt is paid  what debt  i discovered hed been keeping whores  in the tower of the hand  i asked him to confine his salacious acts  to the brothel where such behavior belongs  he wasnt pleased  thank you your grace  for the courage of your testimony  do you remember the precise nature of this threat  im afraid i do my lord  he said perhaps you should speak more softly to me then  monsters are dangerous  and just now kings are dying like flies  and he said this to you at a meeting of the small council  yes  after we received word of robb starks death  he didnt seem gladdened by the news  perhaps his marriage to sansa stark  had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause  youre excused lord varys  father may i ask the witness one question  one  you once said  that without me this city would have faced certain defeat  you said the histories would never mention me  but you would not forget  have you forgotten lord varys  sadly my lord  i never forget a thing  we will adjourn for now  toll the bells in an hours time  clear the court  youd condemn your own son to death  ive condemned no one the trial is not over  this isnt a trial its a farce  cersei has manipulated everything and you know it  i know nothing of the sort   youve always hated tyrion  he killed his king  as did i  do you know the last order the mad king gave me  to bring him your head  i saved your life so you could murder my brother   it wont be murder itll be justice  justice  im performing my sworn duty as hand of the king  if tyrion is found guilty he will be punished accordingly   hell be executed  no hell be punished accordingly  once you said family is what lives on  all that lives on  you told me about a dynasty that would last 1000 years  what happens to your dynasty when tyrion dies  im a kingsguard  forbidden by oath to carry on the family line  im well aware of your oath  what happens to your name  who carries the lion banner into future battles  your nephews  lancel lannister  others whose names i dont even remember  what happens to my dynasty  if i spare the life of my grandsons killer  it survives through me  ill leave the kingsguard  ill take my place as your son and heir  if you let tyrion live  done  when the testimonys concluded and a guilty verdict rendered  tyrion will be given the chance to speak  hell plead for mercy ill allow him to join the nights watch  in three days time hell depart for castle black  and live out his days at the wall  youll remove your white cloak immediately  you will leave kings landing  to assume your rightful place at casterly rock  you will marry a suitable woman  and father children named lannister  and youll never turn your back on your family again  you have my word  and you have mine  not going well is it   youre going to be found guilty  oh you think so  when you are you need to enter a formal plea for mercy  and ask to be sent to the wall  fathers agreed to it  hell spare your life and allow you to join the nights watch  ned stark was promised the same thing  and we both know how that turned out  father is not joffrey hell keep his word  how do you know  do you trust me  keep your mouth shut no more outbursts  this will all be over soon  the crown may call its next witness  state your name  shae  do you swear by all the gods  that your testimony will be true and honest  i swear it  do you know this man  yes tyrion lannister  how do you know him  i was handmaiden to his wife lady sansa  this man stands accused of murdering king joffrey  what do you know of this  i know that hes guilty  he and sansa planned it together  silence  continue  she wanted revenge for her father  her mother her brother  she blamed their deaths on the king  tyrion was happy to help  he hated joffrey he hated the queen  he hated you my lord  he stole poison from the grand maesters chamber  to put in joffreys wine  how could you possibly know all this  why would he reveal such plans to his wifes maid  i wasnt just her maid  i was his whore  i beg your pardon  you said you were his  his whore  how did you come to be in his service  he stole me  i was with another man  a knight in your lordships army  but when tyrion arrived at the camp  he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent  he broke the knights arm and brought me to lord tyrion  you belong to me now he said  i want you to fuck me like its my last night in this world  silence silence  and did you  did i what  fuck him like it was his last night in this world  i did everything he wanted  whatever he told me to do to him  whatever he felt like doing to me  i kissed him where he wanted  i licked him where he wanted  i let him put himself where he wanted  i was his property  i would wait in his chambers for hours  so he could use me when he was bored  he ordered me to call him my lion so i did  i took his face in my hands and said  i am yours and you are mine  shae  please dont  i am a whore  remember  that was before he married sansa  after that all he wanted was her  but she wouldnt let him into her bed  so he promised to kill king joffrey for her  i wish to confess  i wish to confess  you wish to confess  i saved you  i saved this city  and all your worthless lives  i should have let stannis kill you all  tyrion  do you wish to confess  yes father  im guilty  guilty is that what you want to hear  you admit you poisoned the king  no of that im innocent  im guilty of a far more monstrous crime  i am guilty of being a dwarf  you are not on trial for being a dwarf  oh yes i am  ive been on trial for that my entire life  have you nothing to say in your defense  nothing but this  i did not do it  i did not kill joffrey  but i wish that i had  watching your vicious bastard die  gave me more relief than 1000 lying whores  i wish i was the monster you think i am  i wish i had enough poison for the whole pack of you  i would gladly give my life  to watch you all swallow it  ser meryn ser meryn  escort the prisoner back to his cell  i will not give my life for joffreys murder  and i know ill get no justice here  so i will let the gods decide my fate  i demand a trial by combat
