brutish as this life is  i suppose it is preferable to beheading  what did ned stark want you for  buying from a slaver  selling to one  some poachers i caught on my land  under my reign you wont be punished for such nonsense  you can rest assured of that  betterlooking bitches than youre used to uncle  my mothers been looking for you  we ride for kings landing today  before you go you will call

stand the wailing of women  one word and ill hit you again  im telling mother  go tell her  but first you will get to lord and lady stark  and you will fall on your knees in front of them  and tell them how very sorry you are that you are at their service  and that all your prayers are with them do you understand  you cant  do you understand  the prince will remember that little lord  i hope so  if he forgets be a good dog and remind him  ah time for breakfast  bread and two of those little fish  and a mug of dark beer to wash it down  and bacon burned black  hyah   little brother  beloved siblings  is bran going to die  apparently not   what do you mean  the maester says the boy may live  its no mercy letting a child linger in such pain  only the gods know for certain  all the rest of us can do is pray  the charms of the north seem entirely lost on you  i still cant believe youre going  its ridiculous even for you  wheres your sense of wonder  the greatest structure ever built the intrepid men of the nights watch  the wintry abode of the white walkers  tell me youre not thinking of taking the black  and go celibate the whores would go begging  from dorne to casterly rock  no i just want to stand on top of the wall  and piss off the edge of the world  the children dont need to hear your filth  come  even if the boy lives hell be a cripple a grotesque  give me a good clean death any day  speaking for the grotesques id have to disagree  death is so final whereas life  ah life is full of possibilities  i hope the boy does wake  id be very interested to hear what he has to say  my dear brother  there are times you make me wonder whose side youre on  my dear brother you wound me  you know how much i love my family  please  oh i would have dressed your grace  this is your home im your guest  handsome one isnt he  i lost my first boy a little blackhaired beauty  he was a fighter too  tried to beat the fever that took him  forgive me  its the last thing you need to hear right now  i never knew  it was years ago  robert was crazed beat his hands bloody on the wall  all the things men do to show you how much they care  the boy looked just like him  such a little thing  a bird without feathers  they came to take his body away and robert held me  i screamed and i battled but he held me  that little bundle  they took him away and i never saw him again  never have visited the crypt never  i pray to the mother every morning and night  that she return your child to you  i am grateful  perhaps this time shell listen  a sword for the wall   i already have one  good man   have you swung it yet  of course i have  at someone i mean  its a strange thing the first time you cut a man  you realize were nothing but sacks of meat  and blood and some bone to keep it all standing  let me thank you ahead of time  for guarding us all from the perils beyond the wall  wildlings and white walkers and whatnot  were grateful to have  good strong men like you protecting us  weve guarded the kingdoms for 8000 years  is it we already  have you taken your vows then  soon enough  give my regards to the nights watch  im sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force  and if not  its only for life  thank you nymeria  septa mordane says i have to do it again  my things werent properly folded she says  who cares how theyre folded  theyre going to get all messed up anyway  its good youve got help  watch  nymeria gloves   impressive  shut up  nymeria gloves  i have something for you  and it has to be packed very carefully  a present  close the door

choice  and youve made it  cat  i cant do it ned   i really cant  you can  you must  youve said goodbye to bran  hes not going to die i know it  you starks are hard to kill  my mother   she was very kind  good  next time i see you youll be all in black  it was always my color   farewell snow  and you stark  theres great honor serving in the nights watch  the starks have manned the wall for thousands of years  and you are a stark  you might not have my name  but you have my blood  is my mother alive  does she know about me where i am where im going  does she care  the next time we see each other  well talk about your mother  huh  i promise  gods this is country  ive half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going  ive half a mind to go with you  what do you say just you and me  on the kingsroad swords at our sides  a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight  you should have asked me 20 years ago  there were wars to fight women to marry  we never had the chance to be young  i recall a few chances  there was that one oh what was her name  that common girl of yours  becca with the great big tits you could bury your face in  bessie she was one of yours  bessie thank the gods for bessie  and her tits  yours was aleena  no you told me once meryl  your bastards mother   wylla  thats it  she must have been a rare wench  to make lord eddard stark forget his honor  you never told me what she looked like  nor will i  we were at war  none of us knew if we were gonna go back home again  youre too hard on yourself you always have been  i swear if i werent your king youd have hit me already  the worst thing about your coronation  ill never get to hit you again  trust me thats not the worst thing  there was a rider in the night  daenerys targaryen has wed some dothraki horselord  what of it should we send her a wedding gift  a knife perhaps a good sharp one  and a bold man to wield it  shes little more than a child  soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding   tell me were not speaking of this  oh its unspeakable to you  what her father did to your family that was unspeakable  what rhaegar targaryen did to your sister  the woman i loved  ill kill every targaryen i get my hands on  but you cant get your hands on this one can you  this khal drogo  its said he has 100000 men in his horde  even a million dothraki are no threat to the realm  as long as they remain on the other side of the narrow sea  they have no ships robert  there are still those in the seven kingdoms who call me usurper  if the targaryen boy crosses with a dothraki horde at his back   the scum will join him  he will not cross  and if by chance he does well throw him back into the sea  theres a war coming ned  i dont know when  i dont know who well be fighting  but its coming  sit  youll be fed  untie them  ah rapers  they were given a choice no doubt castration or the wall  most choose the knife  not impressed by your new brothers  lovely thing about the watch  you discard your old family and get a whole new one  why do you read so much  look at me and tell me what you see  is this a trick  what you see is a dwarf  if id been born a peasant they mightve left me out in the woods to die  alas i was born a lannister of casterly rock  things are expected of me  my father was the hand of the king for 20 years  until your brother killed that king  yes until my brother killed him  life is full of these little ironies  my sister married the new king  and my repulsive nephew will be king after him  i must do my part for the honor of my house wouldnt you agree  but how  well my brother has his sword  and i have my mind  and a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone  thats why i read so much jon snow  and you  whats your story bastard  ask me nicely and maybe ill tell you dwarf  a bastard boy with nothing to inherit  off to join  the ancient order of the nights watch  alongside his valiant brothersinarms  the nights watch protects the realm from  ah yes yes against grumpkins and snarks  and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about  youre a smart boy  you dont believe that nonsense  everythings better with some wine in the belly  its time we reviewed the accounts my lady  youll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us  talk to poole about it  poole went south with lord stark my lady  we need a new steward  and there are several other appointments that require   our immediate attention  i dont care about appointments  ill make the appointments  well talk about it first thing in the morning  very good my lord  my lady  when was the last time you left this room  i have to take care of him  hes not going to die mother  maester luwin says the most dangerous time has passed  what if hes wrong   bran needs me  rickon needs you  hes six  he doesnt know whats happening he follows me around all day   clutching my leg crying  close the windows  i cant stand it please make them stop  fire  you stay here ill come back  youre not supposed to be here  no one is supposed to be here  its a mercy hes dead already  no   have you ever seen a dragon  dragon gone khaleesi  everywhere even in the east  no dragon brave men kill them   it is known  it is known  a trader from garth told me that dragons come from the moon  the moon  he told me the moon was an egg khaleesi  that once there were two moons in the sky  but one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat  out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons  and they drank the suns fire  moon is no egg  moon is goddess wife of sun   it is known  it is known  leave me with her  why did the trader from garth tell you these stories  men like to talk when theyre happy  before your brother bought me for you  it was my job to make men happy   how old were you  i was nine  when my mother sold me to the pleasure house  nine  i did not touch a man for three years khaleesi  first  you must learn  can you teach me how to make the khal happy   yes  will it take three years  no  welcome  what i am about to tell you must remain between us  i dont think bran fell from that tower  i think he was thrown  the boy was always surefooted before  someone tried to kill him twice  why why murder an innocent child  unless he saw something he wasnt meant to see   saw what my lady  i dont know  but i would stake my life the lannisters are involved  we already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown  did you notice the dagger the killer used  its too fine a weapon for such a man  the blade is valyrian steel the handle dragonbone  someone gave it to him  they come into our home and try to murder my brother  if its war they want  if it comes to that you know ill stand behind you  what is there going to be a battle in the godswood  huh  too easily words of war become acts of war  we dont know the truth yet  lord stark must be told of this  i dont trust a raven to carry these words   ill ride to kings landing  no  there must always be a stark in winterfell   i will go myself  mother you cant  i must  ill send hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you  too large a party attracts unwanted attention  i dont want the lannisters to know im coming  let me accompany you at least  the kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone  what about bran  i have prayed to the seven for more than a month  brans life is in their hands now  no khaleesi  you must look in his eyes always  love comes in at the eyes  it is said that irogenia of lys could finish a man  with nothing but her eyes  finish a man  oh  kings traveled across the world for a night with irogenia  magisters sold their palaces  khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours  they say a thousand men proposed to her  and she refused them all  well she sounds like an interesting woman  i i dont think  that drogo will like it with me on top  you will make him like it khaleesi  men want what theyve never had  and the dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch  are you a slave khaleesi  then dont make love like a slave  very good khaleesi  out there he is the mighty khal  but in this tent he belongs to you  i i dont think  that this is the dothraki way  if he wanted the dothraki way  why did he marry you  no  no  ajjalan anha zalat vitiherat yer hatif  pardon me ser  do i frighten you so much girl  or is it him there making you shake  he frightens me too  look at that face  im sorry if i offended you ser  why wont he speak to me  he hasnt been very talkative these last 20 years  since the mad king had
