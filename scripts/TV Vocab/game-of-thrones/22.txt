bastard got to winterfell  the ironborn were gone  they massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch  and bran and rickon have not been found  they may have escaped  or theon may have taken them back to the iron islands as hostages  have you received any demands    have you heard anything from theon at all   gasps    shivering   where am i  who are you  what do you want  i want to do this   screaming   do you know how long its going to take us  to get to kings landing walking through fields and forests  yes   sheep bleating   so how shall we pass the time  by putting one foot in front of the other  its going to be a very dull walk  im here to take you to kings landing  and bring back lady starks daughters in exchange  dull is fine  you know it doesnt matter how loyal a servant you are  no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute  trust me on this  people have been serving me since i was born  you think lady stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank  following her around for the rest of her life  a weeks journey with you and shell order you to fall on your sword  if lady stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service  im sure shell let me know  shes an honest woman  all the good its done her   moans   how did you come into lady starks service  theres something we can talk about  not your concern kingslayer  it had to be recently  you werent with her at winterfell  how would you know  because i visited winterfell  i would have noticed your dour head  smacking into the archways  move   were you pledged to stannis  gods no  ah renly  really  he wasnt fit to rule over anything  more important than a 12course meal   shut your mouth  why  i lived with him at court since he was a boy dont forget  could hardly escape the little tulip  skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks  i knew him far better than you  i knew him as well as anyone  as a member of his kingsguard  he trusted me with everything  he would have been a wonderful king  sounds like you quite fancied him  i did not fancy him  oh gods you did  did you ever tell him  no of course not  you werent renlys type im afraid  he preferred curlyhaired little girls like loras tyrell  youre far too much man for him  im not interested in foul rumors  unless theyre about me  its all true about renly  his proclivities were the worst kept secret at court  its a shame the throne isnt made out of cocks   theyd have never got him off it  shut your mouth  i dont blame him  and i dont blame you either  we dont get to choose who we love   horse snorts    where are you headed then  jaime south   you  riverrun  staying off the kingsroad are you  they get you no matter where you go   you cant win  no you really cant  looks like youre safe enough though  meaning no offense my lady but   laughs  i wouldnt tangle with you   laughs    seven blessings to you  and you  jaime he knows who i am   he doesnt  maybe youre right  but what if youre not what if he tells someone  were not doing it  hes an innocent man  more innocent than lady starks daughters  make it tighter here  thats better  it makes you look very strong  no flowers  i said no flowers  all these are wrong bring others  yes your grace  bloody flowers  on the king  looks like a tyrell rose  give it to margaery for her wedding gown  should be more than enough fabric  tell me what you think of her  who  margaery  shes an ideal match  with the tyrells beside us  well crush the northerners  hang their lords burn their strongholds  sow their fields with salt  and no one will think of rebelling for another century  it is a good match but what do you think of her  shes beautiful and intelligent  yes she is  her concern with the wellbeing of the common people is interesting  not to me   chuckles   i only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself  this is becoming one of the most boring  conversations ive ever had  margaery tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason  she dresses like a harlot for a reason  she married a traitor and known degenerate  like renly baratheon for a reason  she married renly baratheon because she was told to  thats what intelligent women do  what theyre told   you need to ask yourself  i dont need to do anything   sighs   better  much better  i still dont believe it  he didnt he didnt want anything  he just takes an interest because he loved my mother  men only want one thing from a pretty girl  littlefingers not in love with me  love is not the thing he wants  hes too old  they never see it that way  he didnt ask you to do something for him  spy on someone or  no  if he does ask you for anything  or try anything  or touch you i want you to tell me  why what will you do  i will make him stop   knocks   guard ser loras tyrell my lady  send him in  lady sansa  ser loras  my sister margaery invites you to take  the air with her and our grandmother  the lady olenna in the gardens  may i escort you to them  i believe you grow more beautiful every day lady sansa  you are too kind ser loras  you probably dont remember the first time we met  at the hands tourney you gave me your favor  a rose a red rose  of course i did  margaery its more your color   you take

good of you to visit me  and my foolish flock of hens  were very sorry for your losses  and i was sorry when i heard of lord renlys death lady margaery   he was very gallant  gallant yes  and charming and very clean  he knew how to dress and smile  and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king  renly was brave and gentle grandmother  father liked him and so did loras  loras is young and very good  at knocking men off horses with a stick  that does not make him wise  as to your fathead father  grandmother what will sansa think of us  she might think we have some wits about us  one of us at any rate  it was treason i warned them  robert has two sons and renly has an older brother  how could he possibly have any claim  to that ugly iron chair  we should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me  but once the cows been milked  theres no squirting the cream back up her udders  so here we are to see things through  what do you say to that sansa  shall we have some lemon cakes  lemon cakes my favorite  so weve been told  are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death  here sansa  come sit with me  im much less boring than these others  do you know my son  the lord of highgarden  i havent had the pleasure  no great pleasure believe me  a ponderous oaf  his father was an oaf as well  my husband the late lord luthor  he managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking  they say he was looking up at the sky  and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him  and now my son is doing the same  only this time hes riding a lion instead of a horse  now  i want you to tell me the truth  about this royal boy this joffrey  i i  you you  who else would know better  weve heard some troubling tales  is there any truth to them  has this boy mistreated you  has he ripped out your tongue  joff king joffrey  he his grace is very fair  and handsome and as brave as a lion  yes all lannisters are lions  and when a tyrell farts it smells like a rose  but how kind is he how clever  has he a good heart a gentle hand  im to be his wife  i only want to know what that means   footsteps approaching   bring me some cheese  the cheese will be served after the cakes my lady  the cheese will be served when i want it served  and i want it served now  are you frightened child  no need for that  were only women here  tell us the truth no harm will come to you  my father always told the truth  yes he had that reputation  and they named him traitor and took his head  joffrey  joffrey did that  he promised he would be merciful and he cut my fathers head off  and he said that was mercy  then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it  go on  i i cant i never meant  my father was a traitor  my brother as well i have traitors blood  please dont make me say anymore  shes terrified grandmother   just look at her  speak freely child  we would never betray your confidence i swear it  hes a monster  ah  thats a pity  please dont stop the wedding  have no fear the lord oaf of highgarden  is determined that margaery shall be queen  even so we thank you for the truth  ah here comes my cheese   panting   karstark were at war  this march is a distraction  my grandfathers funeral is not a distraction   are we riding to battle at riverrun  no  then its a distraction  my uncle edmure has his forces garrisoned there  we need his men  unless hes been breeding them  he dont have enough to make a difference  have you lost faith in our cause  if its revenge i still got faith in it  if you no longer believe  i can believe till it snows in dorne  dont change the fact that weve got half the men  you dont think we can win  may i speak my mind your grace  have you not been speaking your mind lord karstark  i think you lost this war  the day you married her   horse whinnies   whoa whoa  your grace  youre afraid of her   and she knows it  im not afraid of her   snorting   may i help you lady stark  no  im sorry i shouldnt have  you cant help because a mother  makes one for her children to protect them  only a mother can make them  youve made them before  twice  did they work  after a fashion  i prayed for my son bran to survive his fall  many years before that  one of the boys came down with the pox  maester luwin said if he made it through the night hed live  but it would be a very long night  so i sat with him all through the darkness  listened to his ragged little breaths  his coughing his whimpering  which boy  jon snow  when my husband brought that baby home from the war  i couldnt bear to look at him  i didnt want to see those brown  strangers eyes staring up at me  so i prayed to the gods take him away  make him die  he got the pox  and i knew i was the worst woman who ever lived  a murderer  id condemned this poor innocent child  to a horrible death  all because i was jealous of his mother  a woman he didnt even know  so i prayed to all seven gods  let the boy live  let him live  and ill love him  ill be a mother to him  ill beg my husband to give him a true name  to call him stark and be done with it  to make him one of us  and he lived  and he lived  and i couldnt keep my promise  and everything thats happened since then  all this horror thats come to my family  its all because i couldnt love a motherless child  was it hard for you to kill the halfhand  yes  you liked him  i like you but if youre playing us false  it wont be hard for me to kill you  ive got wildling blood in my veins   these are my people  i understand  well how could you understand  you want to protect your people  do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans  half of whom want to massacre the other half  for one insult or another  they speak seven different languages in my army  the thenns hate the hornfoots  the hornfoots hate the iceriver clans  everyone hates the cave people  so you know how i got moon worshippers  and cannibals and giants  to march together in the same army  no  i told them we were all

shes a whore  yes well we shouldnt be judgmental about these things   you fucked her  oh please  all right yes i fucked her once  twice  but since i met you my lady  ive been with no one else  and was she good did you like her  not as much as i like you obviously  or shed be the one torturing me right now  what did she say about littlefinger  that sansa shouldnt trust him  is there an idiot in any village  who trusts littlefinger  we have to protect her  we cant  now that the lannisters have discarded her  sansa will have many suitors  a great beauty with a very old name  a great beauty oh a great beauty  yes she is objectively very  her face is quite pleasing  to other men and to women  people in general  but not to me of course  i only have eyes for you  you pervert you want her   this child  i dont even want to talk about her   but you are  only because youre making me   chuckles  i didnt force you to open your mouth  and make words come out  this is cruel and unfair cruelly unfair

 dangerous people  moans     knocks   guard lady tyrell my king  send her in  you wanted to see me your grace  im leaving on a hunting trip  i just wanted to make sure  you had everything you need before i left  thats very thoughtful your grace  i have everything i could want  good good  how are you finding life in the capital  it must be quite a change after renlys camp  a welcome one  a military encampment is no place for a lady  and the bedside of a traitor  is that a place for a lady  your grace  i tried to do my duty as a wife that is all  what was your duty to this traitor as you saw it  the duty of any wife to any husband  to provide him with children  you failed to do this   why  i  i would not speak ill of the dead your grace  you think one ought to speak kindly  of a traitor merely because hes had a sword put through his heart  no  i do beg your pardon  the subtleties of politics are often lost on me  renly  i dont believe he was interested  in the company of women  what makes you say this  whenever i wanted to make a child with him  he  he had so many excuses  so many latenight war councils  he never wanted to try  except one evening  after hed had far too much wine to drink  he suggested something  something that sounded very painful  and couldnt possibly result in children  maybe the fault was with me  no he was a known  degenerate  its such a relief to hear you say so your grace  mmm  ive considered making his perversion  punishable by death  as is your right  you must do whatever you need to do  you are the king  yes  i am  do you like it  i just had it made  probably one of the finest weapons in the seven kingdoms  its beautiful  will you show me how it works  its a new design  much easier to load theres no crank  you use this lever to draw the string  the bolt goes here  and then you just aim  and   laughs   would you take me hunting sometime  forgive me your grace  i know a hunt is no place for a woman  its not unheard of  my father would never let me before  you no longer belong to him  do you want to hold it  may i please  i imagine it must be so exciting  to squeeze your finger here  and watch something die over there  could you do it  could you  kill something  i dont know your grace do you think i could  yes  would you like to watch me  yes   screams  stop stop   tell us the truth  about what   screams  i dont know what you want  i want the truth  what truth  whyd you take winterfell  i took it to i took it   who gave the orders  no one   i took it on my own  why  to take the north while it was vulnerable  what were you going to do once you took it  hold it rule it  good thats very good   screams   why did you do that i told you  why did you take winterfell  i took it to bring glory to my house and my father  wait wait wait wait  i took it because i hated the starks  i hated them for holding me prisoner  i wanted to hurt them  what are you doing  please   screaming   ill tell you anything  just

his eyes  only when im asleep  thats how it begins until you learn to control it  youre a warg  its not just wolves  sometimes in my dreams theres a   a threeeyed raven  youve seen it  we saw him together you havent forgotten  does it have anything to do with warging  no the raven is something different  something deeper  the raven brings the sight  seeing things that havent happened yet  or things that happened long before you were born  or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away  whats he telling him  why dont you ask  isnt he ashamed your brother  needing you to protect him  wheres the shame in that  any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him  is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting  some people will always need help  that doesnt mean theyre not worth helping  when my father died i dreamt it  you didnt dream it you saw it  so did i  you have the sight too  when i told my father about your father  for the first time in my life i saw him cry  your father is howland reed  yeah  he saved my fathers life during the rebellion  your father told you about the rebellion  mine never did  but i saw that too  what else have you seen  only one thing that matters  you   men laughing   thoros i never liked the skinny ones  like drinking from a puddle  not that im averse to drinking from a puddle  every now and again you understand  i dont drink ale  theres no story so good a drink wont make it better   yeah  you see  theyve all suffered through my bouts of sobriety  its very tedious for all concerned  now how did three children  were

hells  are you doing with the stark bitch  jaime its a tough decision  take the bridge and risk being seen  or cross the great water   silence kingslayer  anyone can see us on the bridge  but cross by water and the current could take us  or i could escape down the river  good luck  its wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas  which will she choose  gambler at heart  wouldnt have guessed

knights felt the need to carry two swords   sighs   ooh  you move well  for a great beast of a woman  you shouldnt grimace before you lunge  it gives away the game  bit of a quandary for you  if you kill me you fail lady stark  but if you dont kill me  im going to kill you  youre good  graceless but good  see if you were willing to hurt me  you might have had me there   grunting    grunts    panting    groans coughs    jaime breathing heavily    horse neighs   looks like your womans getting the better of you  if you can call that a woman  we enjoy a good fight  gets our juices flowing
