least i have the courage to face my enemies  what do the stone crows do  hide behind rocks and shiver  when the knights of the vale ride by  are those the best weapons you could steal  good enough for killing sheep  if the sheep dont fight back  lannister smiths shit better steel  you think you can win us over with your trinkets  that trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns  but if

lord father taught me it was death to bare steel  against your liege lord  but doubtless the greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me  your meat  is bloody tough   what is it whats happened  shh its

beyond the wall theyre the only gods  even slaves are allowed to pray  youre not a slave  well your friend did put a knife to my throat  im not complaining little lord  just telling truths  what did you mean about hearing the gods  you asked them  theyre answering you  shh  open your ears  its only the wind  who do you think sends the wind  if not the gods  they see you boy  they hear you  your brother will get no help from them where hes going  the old gods have no power in the south  the weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago  how can they watch when they have no eyes  well theres a big man  he has giants blood in him or im the queen  go back and find your clothes hodor  go dress  hodor  are there really giants beyond the wall  giants and worse than giants  i tried telling your brother  hes marching the wrong way  all these swords they should be going north boy  north not south  the cold winds are rising  they were touched by white walkers  thats why they came back  thats why their eyes turned blue  only fire will stop them  how do you know that  i read about it in a book  a very old book in maester aemons library  what else did the book say  the white walkers  sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years  and when they wake up  and when they wake up what  i hope the wall is high enough  summer snows my lady  robbs brought the north with him  the river lords are falling back  with jaime lannister at their heels  and lord tywin is bringing around a second lannister army from the south  our scouts confirm its even larger than the kingslayers  one army or two the kings in the north  threw back hosts  mother  you look well  lady catelyn youre a welcome sight in these troubled times  we had not thought to meet you here my lady  i had not thought to be here  i would speak with my son alone  i know you will forgive me my lords  you heard her move your asses  come on out  you too greyjoy are you bloody deaf  have no fear my lady  well shove our swords up tywin lannisters bunghole  and then its on to the red keep to free ned   you old devil rodrik  jon  youre not wasting away are you  i remember the day you came into this world  redfaced and squalling  and now i find you leading a host to war   there was no one else  no one  who were those men i saw here   none of them are starks  all of them are seasoned in battle  if you think you can send me back to winterfell  oh would that i could  there was  a letter  from sansa  from the queen you mean   theres no mention of arya  no  how many men do you have   if i go to kings landing and bend my knee to joffrey  you would never be allowed to leave no  our best hope our only hope  is that you can defeat them in the field  and if i lose  do you know what happened to the targaryen children   when the mad king fell  they were butchered in their sleep  on the orders of tywin lannister  and the years have not made him kinder  if you lose  your father dies  your sisters die  we die  well that makes it simple then  i suppose it does  from here it might be best if bronn and i continue alone  best for tyrion son of tywin  not best for me  if the half man betrays us  shagga son of dolf will cut off his manhood  and feed it to the goats yes  all right then  time to meet my father   tyrion  uncle  father  the rumors of your demise were unfounded  sorry to disappoint you  and who are these  companions of yours  this is shagga son of dolf  chieftain of the stone crows  timett son of timett ruler of the burned men  this fair maid is chella daughter of cheyk  leader of the black ears  and here we have bronn son of  you wouldnt know him  may i present my lord father  tywin son of tytos of house lannister  lord of casterly rock and warden of the west  kind of you to go to war for me  you left us no choice  the honor of the house was at stake  your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly  we have our differences jaime and i  hes braver im better looking  hes been covering himself in glory  jaime smashed the river lords at the golden tooth  and now lays siege to riverrun catelyn starks homeland  and the starks lord eddard  is our hostage he will lead no armies from his dungeon cell  how did my sweet sister persuade the king  to imprison his dear friend ned  robert baratheon is dead joffrey rules in kings landing  my sister rules you mean  starks son has called his banners   he moves south with a strong host  a green boy  one taste of battle and hell run  back to winterfell wi his tail between his legs  maybe  though the boy does have a certain belligerence  youd like him  while were on the subject of war  i made promises to my friends here  and a lannister always pays his debts  we shall require 3000 helms and shields  plus swords pikes  gorgets maces  if it please my lord  ser addam bids me report that the northmen  have crossed the neck  the wolf rushes into the lions jaws  so be it kevan command the drummers beat assembly  and send word to jaime that i am moving against robb stark  at once my lord  it is said that the men of the mountain clans are great warriors  ride with me against my enemies  and you shall have all my son promised you and more  only if the half man fights with us  until we hold the steel he pledged us  the little lions life is ours  the scouts report lord tywin moves north  we need to get him on broken ground  put his knights at a disadvantage  no we need to get around him  and break jaime lannisters siege of riverrun  do that and the river lords will join us  to do either we need to cross the river  and the only crossing is at the twins  lord frey controls that bridge  your fathers bannerman  the late lord frey my father calls him  at the trident he didnt appear until the battle was done  some men takes their oaths more seriously than others  robbs right we need that bridge  so whats it going to be  do we move against jaime or lord tywin  your pardon my lords  weve captured a lannister scout  dont worry lad he wont b leaving this tent with his head  where did you find him  in the brush above the encampment  he looked to be counting  how high did you get  maybe more  you dont have to do this yourself  your father would understand  my father unrstands mercy when there is room for it  and he understands honor  and courage  let him go  robb  tell lord tywin winter is coming for him  to find out if he really does shit gold  yes my lord  thank you my lord  are you touched boy letting him go  you call me boy again  go on  oi  it is also the wish of his grace  that his loyal servant janos slynt   commander of the city watch  ser aron  be at once raised to the rank of lord   lord gyles  and granted the ancient seat of harrenhal  and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor  after him until the end of time  in the place of the traitor eddard stark  it is the wish of his grace that tywin lannister  lord of casterly rock and warden of the west  be appointed hand of the king  lastly  in these times of treason and turmoil  it is the view of the council  that the life and safety  of king joffrey  be of paramount importance  ser barristan selmy  your grace i am yours to command  rise ser barristan  you may remove your helm  you have served the realm long and faithfully  every man and woman in the seven kingdoms owes you thanks  but it is time

death relieves us of our sacred trust  whose death ser barristan yours or your kings  you let my father die  youre too old to protect anybody   your grace  the council has determined  that ser jaime lannister will take your place  as lord commander of the kingsguard  the man who profaned his blade  with the blood of the king he had sworn to defend  careful ser  we have nothing but gratitude  for your long service good ser  you shall be given a stout keep beside the sea  with servants to look after your every need  a hall to die in  and men to bury me  i am a knight  i shall die a knight  a naked knight apparently  even now i could cut through the five of you like carving a cake  here boy  melt it down and add it to the others  if any man in this hall has other matters  to set before his

your grace  do you deny your fathers crime  no my lords i know he must be punished  all i ask is mercy  i know my lord father must regret what he did  he was king roberts friend and he loved him  you all know he loved him  he never wanted to be hand until the king asked him  they must have lied to him lord renly or lord stannis  or somebody they must have lied  he said i wasnt the king  why did he say that  he was badly hurt  maester pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy  he wasnt himself otherwise h never would have said it  a childs faith such sweet innocence  and yet they say wisdom oft comes  from the mouths of babes  treason is treason  anything else  if you still have any affection in your heart for me  please do me this kindness your grace  your sweet words have moved me  but your father has to confess  he has to confess and say that im the king  or therell be no mercy for him  he will
