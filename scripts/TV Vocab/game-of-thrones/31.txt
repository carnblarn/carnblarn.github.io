nameday  youll be my new fool  thank you your grace  do you know what it takes  to unite  i told them we were all going to die  if we dont get out  let us go my father will pay you whatever you want  enough to buy me a new head  we need to find sansa stark a husband  tyrion will do as hes bid and will marry ser loras   i am not some brood mare  youre my daughter  my feelings for you have not changed  im not your lady im you whore  hes a crow hell stab us in the back  kill him  thats a fine little blade  maybe ill pick my teeth with it  something wrong with your leg boy  you got to carry me  robb  the lannisters send their regards  too late  you know i didnt have a choice  you know nothing jon snow  your home     magnificent  mmhmm  looks freshforged  it is  no ones made a valyrian steel sword  since the doom of valyria  there are three living smiths  who know how to rework valyrian steel  the finest of them was in volantis  came here to kings landing at my invitation  where did you get this much valyrian steel  from someone who no longer had need of it  youve wanted one of these in the family for a long time   and now we have two  two  the original weapon was absurdly large  plenty of steel for two swords  well thank you its glorious  youll have to train your left hand  any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands  youll never be as good  no  but as long as im better than everyone else  i suppose it doesnt matter  you cant serve in the kingsguard with one hand  wheres that written i can and i will  the kingsguard oath is for life  the war is over the king is safe  the king is never safe  how many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike  other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner  they will continue to do so when you go home   home  youll return to casterly rock  and rule in my stead  you are the lord of casterly rock  i am the kings hand my place is here  i dont expect to see the rock again before i die  you know what they call me  kingslayer oathbreaker  man without honor  now you want me to break another sacred vow  you wont be breaking anything  there is a precedent to relieve a kingsguard of his duties  the king will exercise that prerogative   no  no  no  i dont believe i asked you a question  theres my answer  if you think your bloody honor comes before  my bloody honor is beyond repair  but my answer is still no i dont want casterly rock  i dont want a wife i dont want children  what do you want  supper would be nice  for 40 years ive tried to teach you  if you havent learned by now you never will  go  if serving as a glorified bodyguard  is the sum of your ambition go serve  i suppose you want the sword back  keep it  a onehanded man with no family needs  all the help he can get  how many dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat  please dont  seems to me the smart place  to meet travelers is in a tavern  that way one party is late  the other party can drink some ale inside  this is the prince of dorne were waiting for  not one of your sellsword friends  if hes so damned important how come they sent you to meet him  theres bad blood between the martells of dorne  and the lannisters of casterly rock has been for years  and just in case the martells of dorne  are looking to spill some lannister blood   it may as well be yours eh  no need for cynicism  i happen to be an accomplished diplomat  oh  ah here we are  can you read the sigils  yellow balls  wild lemons on a purple field  house dalt of lemonwood  a vulture grasping a baby in its talons house blackmont  a crowned skull the manwoodys of kingsgrave  boy knows his dornish houses  i need a sigil  and house martell a red sun pierced by a spear  i dont see it my lord  well met my lords  his grace king joffrey welcomes you in his name  my lord father the kings hand sends his greetings as well  i am tyrion lannister of casterly rock  master of coin  forgive me  i dont see prince doran in your company  the princes health forces him to remain at sunspear  he sends his brother prince oberyn  to attend the royal wedding in his stead  yes the king will be delighted to enjoy the company  of a warrior as renowned as prince oberyn  at his wedding feast  will he  and where is prince oberyn  arrived before dawn  not a man for welcome parties  our prince  very well my lords these fine men from the city watch  will escort you to your quarters in the red keep  you must be weary after such a long journey  some accomplished diplomacy that was  now where  we must find prince oberyn before he kills somebody  or several somebodies  how do you plan on finding a single dornishman in a city this big  youre famous for fucking half of westeros  you just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads  where would you go  id probably go to sleep but im getting old  look at this one  how lovely is she  beautiful  but pale  they like them pale in the capital  shows they dont work the fields  do i frighten you  you like  timid timid bores me  youre a bit of mischief arent you  i think she likes you  she has good taste  youre not timid are you  not timid  do you like women  when they look like her my lord  this one will do nicely  very good my lady  oh im not a lady  a term of courtesy in this establishment  a lie anywhere  why not use the right words  im a bastard  she is a whore and youre what  a procurer  any of the others  the two girls can leave  you stay  im afraid im not an offer my lord  everyone who works for littlefinger is an offer  take off your clothes well be here a while   my lord  i am a prince boy  have you ever been with a prince  cant say i have  im wildly expensive  take off your clothes  which way do you like it  my way  and so he spoke and so he spoke   that lord

for staring  i dont see many lannisters where im from  i dont see many dornishmen in the capital  we dont like the smell   come with me lover  gods look at this one  sirs if you follow me ill arrange for a private room  why are you wasting a woman like this on a dornishman  bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil  do you know why all the world hates a lannister  you think your gold and your lions  and your gold lions make you better than everyone  may i tell you a secret  youre not a golden lion  youre just a pink little man  who is far too slow on the draw  longsword is a bad option in close quarters  when i pull my blade your friend starts bleeding  quite a lot im afraid so many veins in the wrist  hell live if you get him help straightaway  so decisions  prince oberyn forgive the intrusion  we heard there might be  trouble  apologies my love  im here to welcome you to the capital  ellaria sand my paramour  the kings own uncle imp  tyrion son of tywin lannister  if

the king is very grateful that you traveled all  this way for his wedding  let us speak truth here joffrey is insulted  i am only the second son after all  well speaking as a fellow second son  i have grown rather used to being the family insult  why did you come to kings landing prince oberyn  i was invited to the royal wedding  i thought we were speaking truth  the last time i was in the capital was many years ago  another wedding  my sister elia  and rhaegar targaryen the last dragon  my sister loved him she bore his children  swaddled them rocked them fed them at her own breast  elia wouldnt let the wet nurse touch them  and beautiful noble rhaegar targaryen  left her for another woman  that started a war  and the war ended right here  when your fathers army took the city  i wasnt actually present  and butchered those children  my nephew and niece  carved them up and wrapped them in lannister cloaks  and my sister you know what they did to her  im asking you a question  ive heard rumors  so have i  the one i keep hearing is that gregor clegane the mountain  raped elia and split her in half  with his great sword  i wasnt there i dont know what happened  if the mountain killed my sister  your father gave the order  tell your father im here  and tell him the lannisters arent the only ones who pay their debts  shh  shh shh  theyre dragons khaleesi  they can never be tamed  not even by their mother   ser barristan  your grace  wheres daario naharis  wheres grey worm  gambling your grace  gambling  mhysa mhysa mhysa  how long have they been at it  since midnight

direwolfs head onto his body  and my mother  they say they cut her throat to the bone  and threw her body in the river  what happened to your family was a terrible crime  i didnt know your brother  he seemed like a good man but i didnt know him  your mother on the other hand  i admired her  she wanted to have me executed  but i admired her  she was a strong woman  and she was fierce  when it came to protecting her children  sansa  your mother would want you to carry on  you know its true  will you pardon me my lord  id like to visit the godswood  of course of course prayer can be helpful i

more practical  elegant i think  thank you for your help with the other matter   the symptoms have abated  gone completely  i am in your debt maester qyburn  not a maester your grace but happy to help  whenever i can  odd little man  ive grown rather fond of him  hes quite talented you know  what symptoms  symptoms that are not your concern  you let him touch you  you jealous  im surprised  you never let pycelle near you  you think id let that old lecher  put his hands on me  he smells like a dead cat  im not sure ive ever smelled a dead cat  well they smell like pycelle  you drink more than you used to   yes  why  lets see you started a brawl in the streets with ned stark  and disappeared from the capital  my husband died in a tragic hunting accident  it must have been traumatic for you  my only daughter was shipped off to dorne  we suffered through a siege  a rather short siege  a rather short siege that i didnt expect to survive  and now im marrying my eldest son  to a wicked little bitch from highgarden  while im supposed to marry her brother  a renowned pillow biter so  father disowned me today  he cant disown you youre all hes got  youre forgetting tyrion  you dont really plan on staying in the kingsguard do you  staying in the kingsguard means i live right here  in the red keep with you   not now  i want  not now when ive been back for weeks   somethings changed  everythings changed  you come back after all this time with no apologies  and one hand and expect everything to be the same  what do you want me to apologize for  for leaving me  you think i wanted to be taken prisoner  dont know what you wanted you werent here  you left me alone  every day i was a prisoner i plotted my escape  every day i murdered people so i could be here with you   you took too long  i   what are you saying  im saying you took too long   come in  go away  forgive me your grace  you told me to come at once if there was anything important  you plan on killing all the crows yourself  do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter  we wait for mances orders  you sent a man over the wall at the full moon  if hes not back yet hes not coming back  and what is it you want  march on castle black with just this lot  your pretty crow said 1000 men are nesting there  yeah well hes a liar  he is  shouldnt it be he was  you said you put three arrows in him  i did  ive seen you slip a shaft through a rabbits eye at 200 yards  if that boys still walking its cause you let him go  thenns  i fucking hate thenns  mance sent you  how did you find us  you came from the south not the north  took a detour  got some supper from a village down that way  why does the meat down here taste so much better  than it does on our side of the wall  help yourself  maybe everythings just better fed down here  fat and lazy  easier for us hmm  you didnt see us coming  lost your warg  and that baby crow you had with you  lost him too  ill answer to mance  i wont answer to you  she yours  im not anybodys  too scrawny  not like those crows at castle black  think of them stuck in their larders  stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage  and stew getting nice and fat  and marbled  i know weve had our differences tormund  but just one time before you die  you really ought to try crow  draw  loose  last time i saw him  he was in the courtyard at winterfell  he said next time i see you  youll be all in black  i was jealous of robb my whole life  the way my father looked at him  i wanted that  he was better than me at everything  fighting and hunting  and riding  and girls  gods the girls loved him  i wanted to hate him but i never could  sometimes i want to hate you  well youre better than me at everything  except reading  theyre theyre ready for you  hes wanted to hang me for a while nows his chance  no ones going to hang you  youve done nothing wrong  ive done plenty wrong  so you admit you murdered qhorin halfhand  i didnt murder him  no you put your sword  through a brother of the nights watch  what do you call that  he wanted me to kill him  a bastard son of a traitor  what would you expect  the halfhand believed our only chance  to stop mance was to get a man inside his army  dont talk about the halfhand as if you knew him  he was my brother  then youd know hed do anything to defend the wall  the free folk would have boiled him alive but letting me kill him  the free folk listen to him  he even talks like a wildling now  aye i talk like a wildling i ate with the wildlings  i climbed the wall with the wildlings i  i laid with a wildling girl  you admit to breaking your vows then  i do  the law is the law the boy must die  if we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl  the wall would be manned by headless men  theres a difference between sneaking off  to the moles town brothel and sleeping with the enemy  while we sit here  debating which rules i broke  mance rayder marches on the wall with an army of 100000  impossible  you cant get  before they start killing each other  hes united the thenns  the hornfoots the iceriver clans  he has giants fighting for him  giants  have you ever been beyond the wall ser  i commanded the city watch of kings landing boy  and now youre here  you must not have been very good at your job  how dare you  theres a band of wildlings south of the wall already  led by tormund giantsbane  i killed their warg and three others  they shot me full of arrows  their orders are to attack castle black from the south  when mance hits it from the north  the signal for the attack will be a bonfire  mance said it would be the greatest fire  the north has ever seen  thats the truth  all the truth  do you intend to execute me or am i free to go  none of us are free  we are men of the nights watch  but we wont be taking your head today jon snow  go on  i am acting commander here maester aemon  yes you are  and i dont trust the bastard  he told the truth  and you always know when a mans telling a lie  how did you acquire this magical power  i grew up in kings landing  no no  youre a queen not an ox  your grandfather gave me a necklace  just like this one for my 51st nameday  the wedding is in a fortnight grandmother  you cant say no to everything  nonsense my little dears  go and speak to the jewelers of kings landing  tell them who you are tell them who sent you  the one who brings me the best necklace  will get to keep the next best  the margaery tyrell who walks into the sept  a fortnight from now will inspire 1000 songs  now how sad it will be if shes wearing rubbish
