looking for me  youre in command here  youre a long way from home  i asked you a question  aye you did  you asked without manners  and i chose not to answer  i have a royal warrant  for one of these gutter rats youre transporting  well the thing is  these gutter rats belong to the nights watch now  that puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens  its a funny thing  people worry so much about their throats  they forget about whats down low  now i sharpened this blade before breakfast  i could shave a spiders arse if i wanted to  or  i could nick this artery in your leg  and once its nicked theres no one around here who knows how to unnick it  well just keep that  good steel is always needed on the wall  seems you have a choice  you can die here at this crossroads a long way from home  or you can go back to your city and tell your masters  you didnt find what you were looking for  were looking for a boy named gendry  he carries a bulls head helmet  anyone turning him over will earn the kings reward  well be back with more men  and ill be taking your head home along with that bastard boy  tyrion whistling  woman laughing  my lord  you make me wait a long time  and your friend keeps me company  we were just speaking of your bravery  in the victory against the stark auxiliary forces  it was quite a battle  i heard you suffered a terrible head wound  the northerners are such fearsome warriors  and i tell him the story of how we meet  to find such a lovely creature working in your fathers kitchen  it almost beggars belief  strange things do happen  you should taste her fish pie  i dont think lord varys likes fish pie  how can you tell  i can always tell  men like lord varys and i cant let our disadvantages get the best of us  well make a fisherman of him yet  i am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital  friends are such an important part of life  unfortunate that your father didnt want her to come  but rest easy my lord  i am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends  your discretion is legendary  where your friends are concerned  how unspeakable of me to go on and on when all you want to do is rest  i will leave you  welcome to kings landing my dear  the city is made brighter by your presence  we have a council meeting my lord  i dont like threats  who threatened you  im not ned stark i understand the way this game is played  ned stark was a man of honor and i am not  threaten me again and i will have you thrown into the sea  you might be disappointed in the results  the storms come and go  the big fish eat the little fish  and i keep on paddling  come my lord  we shouldnt keep the queen waiting  from this time until the end of time we are not part of your realm  but a free and independent kingdom of the north  he has more spirit than his father ill give him that  youve perfected the art of tearing up papers  give him his fathers bones back at least as a gesture of good faith  youll give the starks our reply cousin  i will your grace  did you see my brother when you were the starks guest  i did  they have not broken his spirit your grace  if you speak with him  tell him hes not been forgotten  i will your grace  safe travels cousin  you have a deft hand with diplomacy  if thats everything  a raven flew in this morning from castle black  trouble with the wildlings  thats why theyre called wildlings  somewhat less wild these days  it seems theyve stopped killing each other and started following this  kingbeyondthewall  another king how many is that now five ive lost count  lord commander asks that we send more men to man the wall  perhaps hes forgotten were fighting a war we have no men to spare  cold winds are rising and the dead rise with them  the northerners are a superstitious people  according to the commander one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers  mormont doesnt lie  how do you kill a dead man  apparently you burn him  one trip to the wall and you come back  believing in grumpkins and snarks  i dont know what i believe  but heres a fact for you  the nights watch is the only thing that separates us  from what lies beyond the wall  i have every confidence the brave men of the nights watch will protect us all  night sir  the gods wanted us to have dignity  wouldnt make us fart when we died  we fart when we die  my blessed mother was holding her own when she left this world  she farted so hard the whole bed shook  farting noises  seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives  we were having a serious discussion  wouldnt two or three be enough for him  would you look at that  nothing like the sight of a woman walking away  i prefer watching them come towards me  im sure thats nice too  well there was a milkmaid  named violet on the next farm over from where i grew up  and we were wrestling together from the time we were six years old  and then we got older  the wrestling uh changed  you were with her  how many times  well as many

 you dont need to see this  he is blood of my blood  who did this  khal pono perhaps  khal jhaqo  they dont like the idea of a woman leading a khalasaar  they will like it far less when im done with them  is it as you remember my lord  looks smaller  everything looks bigger when youre a child  i remember my fathers cabin felt like a palace when i was little  now look at it  theyll be waiting for me on the docks  who will  anyone who matters  this is a big day for them  they havent had much to get excited about since i left  its a hard place the iron islands  always has been  its cold and its wet  i love the cold and wet  they say hard places breed hard men  and hard men rule the world  then youll be king before long  try smiling with your lips closed  hmm better  my father doesnt trust you iron islanders  i dont blame him  he says that youre all reavers and rapers  and that no matter how many women you have  youll never be satis  quit talking about your father  hes right about us  our wives from the iron islands  theyre for breeding thats not enough for us  thats why we take saltwives from the women we capture  capture me take me with you when you go ashore   make me your saltwife  your place is on this ship  not after you leave  father will punish me hell call me a whore  i havent paid you  i barely touched her  and you charge twice as much as every other brothel   and this is what i get crying  one moment my friend  a moment  please accept my sincerest apologies  ramka will take good care of you   sorry my lord  shhh  did he hurt you  not my lord   its megan  who  she works for you  shes the one the girl whose they killed her baby  ah yes that was poorly handled  sometimes those with the most power have the least grace  cant stop thinking about it  i cant sleep  her poor little baby  you know you remind me of another girl  a lovely thing i once acquired from an elysium pleasure house  beautiful like yourself  and intelligent as yourself  but she wasnt happy  she cried often i asked her why but  we didnt have the kind of rapport that you and i have  yes it was quite sad  girls from elysium pleasure houses are expensive  extremely expensive  and this one wasnt making me any money  i hate bad investments  really i do  they haunt me  i had no idea how to make her happy  no idea how to mitigate my losses  a very wealthy patron he offered me a tremendous amount of money  to let him transform this lovely sad girl  to use her in ways that never occur to most men  and you know what occurs to most men  i wouldnt say he succeeded in making her happy  but my losses were definitely mitigated  take tonight off tomorrow megans child  will see you tomorrow  better be happy  that makes me happy  more wine   damn it boy  apologies my lord  leave us podrik  i believe we know how to pour our own wine  is that your new squire could have found you a proper lad  myself i prefer the improper ones  hmm thats a good red   dornish  you know your wines my lord  that i do  a fine dinner my lord  call me tyrion please  im sure youre getting used to fine dinners now that youre a lord  maybe ill hire this cook of yours  wars have been started for less  i heard there was some trouble  in littlefingers brothel the other night  hmm nasty business had to be done  yes of course  city watch must keep the peace  only i hadnt realized peace depended on killing babies   orders are orders  quite right  especially the queens orders  i never said they were the queens orders  no but who else would want to murder king roberts bastards   shes always been a jealous woman  you know your sister better than i do  youve heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister  i dont listen to filth  thats good of you but you have heard them  i suppose people who do believe that filth  consider roberts bastards to be better claimants  to the throne than cerseis children  joffrey is my king the rest doesnt interest me  i appreciate your loyalty  tell me  when your men slaughtered ned starks men in the throne room  did you give the order  i did  and i would again  the man was a traitor he tried to buy my loyalty  the fool  he had no idea you were already bought  are you drunk  ill not have my honor questioned by an imp  im not questioning your honor lord janos  im denying its existence  you think ill stand here and take this from you dwarf  dwarf  you should have stopped at imp  and yes you will stand here and take it from me  unless youd like to take it from my friend here  i intend to serve as hand of the king until my father returns from the war  and seeing as you betrayed the last hand of the king  well i just wouldnt feel safe with you lurking about  what are you  my friends at court will not allow this  the queen herself  the queen regent  and youre a fool to believe shes your friend  we shall hear what joffrey has to say about this  no we shant  theres a ship leaving for east watch by the sea tonight  from there im afraid its rather a long walk to castle black  i hope you enjoy the wall  i found it surprisingly beautiful  in a brutal horribly uncomfortable sort of way  the lads will escort you  the streets arent safe at night my lord  these men are under my command  i command you to arrest this cutthroat  his name is bronn and he is the new commander of the city watch  boys  i have friends at court  powerful friends  the king himself made me a lord  to the new commander  if i told you to murder an infant girl say still at her mothers breast  would you do it without question  without question no  id ask how much  if they come back i say we yield  gendrys the one they want  i dont want to get caught in the middle of a battle  im not afraid of no battles  if you got within a mile of a battle youd fill your pants  ive seen lots of battles   i saw  liar  i saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in flea bottom  stabbed him right in the neck  two men fighting isnt a battle  they had armor on  so  so if they got armor on its a battle  no it isnt  whats a dyers apprentice know about battles anyway  gendrys an armorers apprentice  hot pie tell gendry what makes it a battle  its when theyve got armor on  i already told you that  a knight  howd you know he was a knight  well cause they got armor on  you dont have to be a knight to have armor  any idiot can buy armor  howd you know  cause i sold armor  what do the goldclips want with you  no idea  youre a liar  you shouldnt insult people that are bigger than you  then i wouldnt get to insult anyone  no one gets to insult anyone  no goods ever come of those questions  no goods ever come  youve asked questions before  how can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass  were you asked questions  the hand of the king the hands of the king  lord arryn came first a few weeks before he died  and then lord stark came a few weeks before he died  lord stark  see asking me questions is bad luck  youll probably be dead soon  what did they ask about   my mom  whos your mom  just my mom  worked in a tavern died when i was little  and who was your father  he could be one of those goldhatted bastards for all i know  what about you anyway  i thought they were after you  why  did you kill someone or is it just because youre a girl  im not a girl  yes you are  you think im as stupid as the rest of them  stupider nights watch doesnt take girls

youre a lady  no  i mean yes  my mother was a lady and my sister  you were a lords daughter and you lived in a castle  look all that about cocks i should never have said that  ive been pissing in front of you and everything  i should be calling you milady  do not call me milady  as milady commands  well that was unladylike  what you carrying  pears and oranges  wine from the arbor  and the heir to pyke of the iron islands  the only living son of balon greyjoy  me  dont like wine  womans drink  i need to get to pyke  ill find you a horse  im heading that way  i can take you there  i bet you can  you been at sea long  or were there just no women where you came from  none like you  you dont know what im like  you dont know what youre like  you need someone to teach you  know who i am  you think i offer free rides to every man in jewelry  lord greyjoy  have my things sent up to the castle  you should give me the reins im a better rider than you  ive been on horseback for the last nine years  nine years you still know your way around a ship  have these hands ever touched a rope  dont you worry about my hands  the seas in my blood  youll never be in the sea if i dont watch where im going  i have a proposal for my father  one that will make him king again  and me after him  you may stay at the castle tonight if youre lucky  is that an offer from my future king  an order from your future king  you can tell your grandchildren about this night  i dont imagine it will be a story fit for children  father  nine years is it  they took a frightened boy  what have they given back  a man   your blood and your heir  we shall see  stark had you longer than i did  lord stark is gone  and how do you feel about that  whats done is done  ive brought you a proposal from robb stark  who gave you those clothes  was it ned starks pleasure to make you his daughter  if my clothes offend you i will change them  it will  that bauble around your neck  did you pay the iron price for it or the gold  i asked a question  did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made  or did you buy it to match your fine clothes  iron or gold  gold  ill not have my son dressed as a whore  my fears have come true  the starks have made you theirs  my blood is salt and iron  yet the stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven  clutching his message  the offer he makes is one i proposed  he heeds your counsel  ive lived with him hunted with him fought at his side  he thinks of me as a brother  no not here not in my hearing you will not name him brother  this son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword  or have you forgotten your own blood  i forget nothing  i remember my brothers  and i remember when my father was a king  i see  i destroy robb starks enemies for him  and he will make me king of the iron islands once again  i will lead the attack myself  oh you will  im your son your only living heir  who else  i told you to wait outside  how did you get past the guards  anything with a cock is easy to fool  my dear   yara  so good to see you brother  this is a homecoming ill tell my grandchildren about  she cant lead an attack  and why not  youre a woman  youre the one in skirts  this isnt winterfell boy  your sister took over command of your eldest brothers ship  after your new father killed him  whats dead may never die  the only night shes spent off these islands has been spent on the sea  shes commanded men shes killed men  she knows who she is  no man gives me a crown  i pay the iron price  i will take my crown  that is who i am  that is who we have always been  you wont stand a chance against the lannisters on your own  who said anything about the lannisters  youll have your gold when we take the treasury at kings landing  all these kings fighting for the throne and this stannis has the smallest army  why would i bet on the man with the worst chance  because youre a smart gambler  stannis has proved himself in war twice  his baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield  neither has the false king joffrey  and yet they both have larger armies  stannis has just begun the fight  his bannermen will rally to his cause  theres no man in the seven kingdoms more honorable than stannis baratheon  or more worthy of loyalty  what is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings   mind your words pirate  matthos  you think im insulted  i am a pirate im an excellent pirate  i dont sail for promises  of course you do  every time you leave harbor youre leaving on a promise  a promise that somewhere on the seas  somebodys got some gold and you can take it from them  thats a promise that always comes true  as is mine  youre not the young man salladhor  and correct me if im wrong most pirates dont grow old  only the clever ones  you want to spend your last few years on the sea  stealing from pentoshi cheesemongers and midanese silk merchants  then go  theyre out there waiting for you  thats easy  what im offering you is hard  come with me and plunder the greatest city in westeros  youll be the richest man in lysene and the most famous  theyll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing  salladhor saan is a good name for songs  it is   one thing i want the queen  the queen  cersei i want her  ill sail with your fleet all 30 of my ships  and if we dont drown at the bottom of blackwater bay  i will fuck this blonde queen and i will fuck her well  this war isnt about you  were not attacking kings landing so that you can rape the queen  im not going to rape her im going to fuck her  as if she would just let you  you dont know how persuasive i am  i never tried to fuck you  stannis is the rightful king  and the lord of light  the one true god  ive been all over the world my boy  and everywhere i go people tell me about the true god  they all think they found the right one  the one true god is whats between a womans legs  and better yet a queens legs  i never thought youd have a true believer for a son  hes young yet  i promise you the gold  i promise you the glory i cannot promise you the queen  you believe your king can win  he is the one true king  you westerosers are funny people  a man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him  ill sail with you davos seaworth  you are the most honest smuggler i ever met  make me rich  get me to the gates of kings landing and i will  when will the king have a sail  as soon as his god wills it  hes my god too and yours  but you were too blind to see   let me teach you how to read  oh you and your mother  it wont take long you already know the letters  the holy books are much more persuasive than i can be  i wish i had a god truly  im not mocking you but ive seen men  pray to every god there is pray for wind pray for rain pray for home   none of it works  but you always came home  i wasnt praying you know  but i was  every night that youre at sea  i lit a candle and i prayed for you  you want me to have a god fine  king stannis is my god  he raised me up and blessed me with his trust  he gave you a future  i could never have imagined  you know how to read youll be a knight someday  you think your fire god commanded all that  it was stannis  only stannis  stannis is my king but hes only a man  dont tell him that  lord janos slynt was commander of the city watch  you had no right to exile him  i have every right i am the kings hand  youre serving as the kings hand until father gets here   i am queen regent  listen to me queen regent  youre losing the people   do you hear me  the people  you think i care  you might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead  half the city will starve when winter comes the other half will plot to overthrow you  and goldplated foes just gave them the rallying cry  the queen slaughters babies  you dont even have the decency to deny it  it wasnt you who gave the order was it  joffrey didnt even tell you  did he tell you  i imagine that would be even worse  he did what needed to be done  you want to be the hand of the king  you want to rule  this is what ruling is  lying on a bed of weeds  ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep  im no king but i think theres more to ruling that that  i dont care what you think  youve never taken it seriously  you havent jaime hasnt  its all fallen on me  as has jaime repeatedly according to stannis baratheon  youre funny  youve always been funny  but none of your jokes will ever match the first one will they  you remember  back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death  she was my mother too  now theyre gone  for the sake of you  theres no bigger joke in the world than that  your grace your grace  how did it fare with your pirate  salladhor saan will join our fleet   in my experience pirates prefer fighting unarmed men   does seem the wiser choice  it wont be a choice this time  do you trust him  salladhor saan is an old friend ive known him 30 years  ive never trusted him  now once he gets the smell of gold he never stops  well if he does his job hell have his share  leave us  at once your grace  the lord of light shines through you young warrior  come  what did you say to him  i told him death by fire is the purest death   why  because it is true  youre troubled my king  yeah  these armies are but toys for the lord of light  tell your lord to burn them then  i tell him nothing  i pray for his commands and i obey  my little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts  men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me   you must have faith  faith  in a real war the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten  then we must be the ten  i cannot defeat my brother in the field  and i cant take kings landing without the men he stole  i have seen the path to victory in the flames  at first you must give yourself to the lord of light  ive said the words damn you  i burnt the idols  you must give all of yourself  i have a wife  i took a vow  shes sick  weak  shut away in the tower  she disgusts you  and shes giving you nothing  no sons  only stillborns  only death  i will give you  a son my king  a son
