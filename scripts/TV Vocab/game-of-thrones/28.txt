hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie  you have 8000 unsullied  youre very young to be a captain  hes not a captain hes a lieutenant  even if your numbers are right  you must admit the odds dont favor your side  the second sons have faced worse odds and won  the second sons have faced worse odds and run  or you could fight for me   mero laughs   weve taken the slavers gold

your own life  quite little your grace  verging on none  you could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow  but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife  because you knew id counsel restraint  you came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself  youre not a man who slaughters innocents  for gain or glory  when my son was five he said to me  i dont ever want to die  i wanted to say to him you wont child you wont ever  i hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark afraid  i think mothers and fathers made up the gods  because they wanted their children to sleep through the night  i saw a vision in the flames  a great battle in the snow  i saw it  and you saw whatever she gave birth to  i never believed but when you see the truth  when its right there in front of you  as real as these iron bars  how can you deny her god is real    horse neighs    people chatting   little dragon bitch she talks too much  you talk too much  she wont talk so much when

the whore who doesnt like whores  i like them very much i just refuse to pay them  and im no whore my friend  she sells her sheath and you sell your blade   whats the difference  i fight for beauty  for beauty  we fight for gold  the gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die  the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked  and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you  youll die young  prendahl what do we do about the dragon girl  we cant beat 8000 unsullied on the battlefield  there wont be a battle and we dont have to deal with her eunuchs  we only have to deal with her   shes well guarded  mero tonights a new moon  one of us slips into her camp past her unsullied and her knights  which one of us  close your eyes love  three coins  a coin from meereen  a coin from volantis  and a coin from braavos  the braavosi does the deed  one for each of us darling  no peeking  do you hear me  follow my voice im right here  you have something for me  valar morghulis   knock at door    sighs   lady sansa  you look very handsome my lord  oh yes  the husband of your dreams  but you do look glorious  perhaps we could have a moment alone  do you mind  podrick could you escort lady starks handmaiden  my lady  i want you to know  i didnt ask for this  i hope i will not disappoint you my lord  no dont  you dont have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore  you wont be a prisoner after today  youll be my wife  i suppose thats a different kind of prison  i just wanted to say  im just trying to say very badly  i just  just want to say i know how you feel  i doubt that very much my lord  youre right  i have no idea how you feel  and you have no idea how i feel  but i promise you one thing my lady  i wont ever hurt you  do you drink wine  when i have to  well today you have to  margaery you look radiant your grace  radiant why radiant  its the word that came to mind   chuckles   were going to be sisters soon  we should be friends  youre a musical girl arent you  i imagine you have a lovely voice  a better dancer than a singer im afraid  ah but you know the song the rains of castamere  of course they play it so often here at court  so you know the story of house reyne of castamere  not as well as you im sure  house reyne was a powerful family  very wealthy  the second wealthiest in westeros  arent the tyrells the second wealthiest family in westeros now  of course ambitious climbers dont want to stop  on the second highest rung  if only you could take that final step  youd see further than all the rest  youd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you  so lord reyne built a castle  as grand as casterly rock  he gave his wife diamonds  larger than any my mother ever wore  and finally one day  he rebelled against my father  do you know where house reyne is now  gone  gone  a gentle word  why not say slaughtered  every man woman and child  put to the sword  i remember seeing their bodies hanging  high above the gates of casterly rock  my father let them rot up there all summer  it was a long summer  and now the rains weep oer their halls  and not a soul to hear  if you ever call me sister again  ill have you strangled in your sleep   doors open   what are you doing  your fathers gone  as the father of the realm  it is my duty to give you away to your husband  you may now cloak the bride  and bring her under your protection   light laughter    snickers    laughter    laughter stops   could you  thank you  your grace your grace  my lords my ladies  we stand here in the sight of gods and men  to witness the union of man and wife  one flesh one heart one soul  now and forever  have you ever seen one like it  ive never seen anything like any of this  not in my life  its shocking isnt it  the first time you encounter real wealth  when i was your age i lived on one bowl of stew a day  and stew is a kind word for it  in flea bottom we called them bowls of brown  wed pretend that the meat in them was chicken  we knew it wasnt chicken   liquid pouring   here taste this  you think im trying to poison you  thats good  thats really good  where do you think its from  i couldnt even guess  doesnt matter does it  its the real thing or its not  you only need a tongue to tell the difference  go on have some more  you still dont trust it  you think this is all a mistake  and that youll have to pay somehow for every bite you take  that thought had crossed my mind yeah  there are no mistakes  not for us  im a mistake  im only here because my father grabbed my mother  instead of the girl next to her in the tavern  your father chose your mother because the lord of light willed it  he willed it so you could be here right now  with a power inside you  you cant even begin to understand  and he brought me here to draw it from you  and birth it into the world  were both a part of his plan  he wants this for us  no he demands this of us  i dont understand this  this doesnt seem very religious  according to whom  the silent sisters  with their stern looks  muzzled mouths and driedup cunts  what have their gods done for you  hmm  when you pray to them  whats their answer  a god is real or hes not  you only need eyes to see  death is coming for everyone and everything  a darkness that will swallow the dawn  and we can stop it you and i   breathing heavily   let me show you what you have inside you  come fight death with me   both moaning   what are you doing  you have to trust me  what  get it away  get it off me  dont fight dont fight they wont take much  why are you doing this  i told you theres power in the blood of kings  and you have so much blood  no no no no no  not there not there  you can blame ser davos  he didnt believe in the power of kings blood  he wanted a demonstration  gendry please please your grace  my lord   cries out   the usurper robb stark  the usurper balon greyjoy  the usurper joffrey baratheon    music playing    people chatting   so their son will be your nephew  after youre wed to cersei of course  and you will be the kings stepfather  and brotherinlaw  when you marry the king  joffreys mother will become his sisterinlaw  and your son will be loras nephew  grandson im not sure  but your brother will become your fatherinlaw  that much is beyond dispute   snorts   will you pardon me my lord  of course of course en enjoy  perhaps you could talk to your bridetobe instead  ive got a lifetime for that  stay  you seem rather drunk  rather less than i plan to be  isnt it a mans duty to be drunk at his own wedding  tywin this isnt about your wedding  renly baratheon had a wedding  your wife needs a child  a lannister child as soon as possible   and  if youre going to give her one  you need to perform  what did you once call me  a drunken little lustfilled beast   more than once  there you have it  nothing to worry about  drinking and lust  no man can match me in these things  i am the god of tits and wine  i shall build a shrine to myself  at the next brothel i visit  you can drink you can joke  you can engage in juvenile attempts  to make your father uncomfortable  but you will do your duty  well  my father once told me  nobody cares what your father once told you  congratulations my lady  thank you your grace  well youve done it youve married a lannister  soon youll have a lannister baby  its a dream come true for you isnt it  what a glorious day  yes your grace  i suppose it doesnt really matter  which lannister puts the baby into you  maybe ill pay you a visit tonight  after my uncle passes out  howd you

tradition uncle  come everyone  pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed  get rid of her gown she wont be needing it any longer  ladies attend to my uncle hes not heavy  there will be no bedding ceremony  there will be if i command it  then youll be fucking your own bride  with a wooden cock  what did you say  what did you say  i believe we can dispense with the bedding your grace  im sure tyrion did not mean to threaten the king   laughs   a bad joke your grace  made out of envy of your own royal manhood  mine is so small  my poor wife wont even know im there  your uncle is clearly quite drunk your grace  tyrion i am  guilty  but  but it is my wedding night  my tiny drunk cock and i have a job to do  come wife  i vomited on a girl once  in the middle of the act  not proud of it  but i think honesty is important  between a man and wife dont you agree  come ill tell you all about it  put you in the mood  is that wise my lord  tyrion sansa  my name is tyrion  is that wise tyrion  nothing was ever wiser  astoundingly long  what  neck  you have one  how old are you exactly   well talk wont make you any older  my lord father has commanded me  to consummate this marriage  stop  i cant  i could i wont  but your father  if my father wants someone to get fucked  i know where he can start  i wont share your bed  not until you want me to  what if i never want you to  and so my watch begins   thuds     horse neighs    chatter    yes your grace  how can anyone speak 19 languages  it only took your grace a year to learn dothraki reasonably well  yes well it was either learn dothraki  or grunt at my husband and hope  what do you mean reasonably well  dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master  so guttural and harsh  _  _  athjahakar  athjahaka  athjahakar  athjahakar  well i suppose im a bit out of practice  your high valyrian is very good your grace  the gods could not devise a more perfect tongue  it is the only proper language for poetry   missandei gasps   no screaming or she dies  what do you want  you  let her go  dont scream lovely girl  you were sent here to kill me   chuckles   so why havent you  i dont want to  what do your captains have to say about that  you should ask them  why  we had philosophical differences   over what  your beauty  it meant more to me than it did to them  youre a strange man  im the simplest man youll ever meet  i only do what i want to do  and this is supposed to impress me  yes  why would i trust a man who murders his comrades  they ordered me to murder you  i told them i preferred not to  they told me i had no choice  i told them i am daario naharis  i always have a choice  they drew their swords  and i drew mine  will you fight for me  swear to me  the second sons are yours and so is daario naharis  my sword is yours my life is yours  my heart is yours   door opens    door closes   you really ought to knock  i brought your breakfast   door opens closes    wind howling    baby fusses    cawing   its
