song  oh all right  lets see  oh ahem  the fathers face is stern and strong   he sits and judges right from wrong   he weighs our lives the short and long   and loves the little children   the mother

looks of it  you grow up north of the wall  you learn the proper way to handle game  i didnt see any game before i got here  if i had a bow i could have shot a dozen rabbits  well i made this bow

there  thats about far enough  we come as friends  begging your pardon mlady  but well be the judge of that  valar morghulis  valar dohaeris  my friends here dont speak high valyrian  why are you here my lady  forgive my manners  i dont see many ladies these days  lucky for the ladies  how many times has the lord brought him back  six  ive always been a terrible priest  drank too much rum  fucked all the whores in kings landing  its a terrible thing to say  but by the time i came to westeros i didnt believe in our lord  i decided that he that all the gods  were stories we told the children to make them behave  so i wore the robes and every now and then id recite the prayers  but it was just for show  a spectacle for the locals  until the mountain drove a lance through this ones heart  i knelt beside his cold body  and said the old words  not because i believed in them but  he was my friend  and he was dead  and they were the only words i knew  and for the first time in my life the lord replied  berics eyes opened  and i knew the truth  our god is the one true god  and all men must serve him  youve been to the other side  the other side  there is no other side  i have been to the darkness my lady  he sent you to us for a reason  you have someone he needs  bodkin point  penetrates plate at 200 yards  can you make em  yeah nothing tricky about it  just need decent steel  ill get you the steel  come on  i dont like that woman  thats cause youre a girl  what does that have to do with anything  forgive me lad  what are you doing let go of him   tell them to stop  come on  he wants to be one of you  he wants to join the brotherhood stop them  we serve the lord of light  and the lord of light needs this boy  did the lord of light tell you that or did she  youre not doing this for your god  youre doing it for gold  were doing it for both girl  we cant defend the people without weapons  and horses and food  and we cant get weapons and horses and food without gold  you told me this was a brotherhood  you told me i could be one of you  you are more than they can ever be  theyre just foot soldiers in the great war  you will make kings rise and fall  youre a witch youre going to hurt him  i see a darkness in you  and in that darkness eyes staring back at me  brown eyes  blue eyes green eyes  eyes youll shut forever  we will meet again  you staring at my ass jon snow  you all right  just seeing if you can take a hit lad  sorry were you sleeping  wa  wa wa  water  you want some water  i wish i had some for you  so lets play a game  which body part do you need the least   please  please is not a body part  ill tell you everything please  but youve already told me everything  remember  your daddy was mean to you  the starks didnt appreciate you  one good bit though  the stark boys  theyre still alive  wouldnt that be a hunt to remember  you failed but im a better hunter than you  now  how about your little finger  you dont use that for much do you  no good lets start with that  youve been wondering why youre here  havent you  where you are  who i am  why im doing this to you  so guess  if you guess right  ill tell you  by the old gods and the new i swear it  you win the game  if you can figure out who i am  and why im torturing you  and i win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger  if i win youll let me go  if you think this has a happy ending  you havent been paying attention  please  you say please again and youll wish you hadnt  you first  where are we   the north  too vague  deepwood motte  terrible guess  now where  last hearth  do i look like a fucking umber to you  karhold  karhold  how did you know that  did you see any banners flying when we came in  no  it was just a guess  very good lord theon  and who am i  torrhen karstark  hes dead  strangled by the kingslayer  he was your brother  your father is lord rickard karstark   you swore to tell me if i  youre right  lord rickard karstark is robb starks bannerman  i betrayed robb  thats why youre torturing me  yes  you win  of course you forgot to ask one question  you forgot to ask if im a liar  im afraid i am  everything i told you is a lie  this isnt happening to you for a reason  well one reason i enjoy it  please cut it off cut it off cut it off  i win  thank you for riding here so quickly  i know travel isnt easy in these times  the roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits  but when the king of the north summons us we come  our father has instructed us to tell you  that his alliance with the north can continue  if his terms are met  lord frey requires a formal apology  for your violation of your sacred oath  to marry one of his daughters  of course he deserves as much i was in the wrong  as restitution for this betrayal  he demands harrenhal and all its attendant lands   i dont think thats  we are fighting for the north  harrenhal is not in the north  it is his once the war is over  and we have no further strategic need for it  and theres something else  we will do whatever we can to give lord frey what he needs  not what whom  what  no  our father requires lord edmure to wed  one of his daughters roslin  how old is she   could i see her first  you want to count her teeth  we depart for the twins in the morning  we need an answer before we leave  and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter  or this alliance is at an end  your father does realize were in the middle of a war  father is old  it will put his heart at peace  if he could see her wed to a good husband  and his recent experience has made him wary  of long engagements  he has every right to be  please excuse us while we discuss it  why should i let that old ferret choose my bride for me  at the very least i should be offered the same choice you were  im his liege lord  hes a proud man and weve wounded him  i didnt wound him  my answer is no  listen to me  and listen very carefully you  the laws of gods and men are very clear  no man can compel another man to marry  the laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth  its all right you heard him  if you refuse our alliance with the freys is dead  hes wanted me for one of his daughters since i was 12  hes not gonna stop wanting it now  when i say no he will come back  and offer me a daughter of my choosing  youre willing to risk our freedom  and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife  i have a war to fight  we cant win it without them  i have no time to haggle  you said you wanted to make amends for the stone mill  you recall that heroic engagement  i had something less permanent in mind  ive won every battle  but im losing this war  if we dont do this and do it now  were lost  ill marry her  youre paying for my sins uncle  its not fair or right  ill remember it  i see my men have finally found you  something appropriate to wear  yes most kind of them  youre a stark bannerman lord bolton  i am acting on lady starks orders  to return jaime lannister to kings landing  when king robb left harrenhal his mother was his prisoner  if she wasnt his mother  hed have hanged her for treason  i should send you back to robb stark  you should  but instead youre sitting here  watching me fail at dinner  why might that be  wars cost money  many people would pay a great deal for you  we both know who would pay the most  or make you pay the most  if he found out you had captured me  and sent me back up north for a summary execution  youre right  perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies  it would be  if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it  king robb is keeping your father quite busy  he doesnt have time for anything else  hell make time for you  as soon as youre well enough to travel  i will allow you to go to kings landing  as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made  and you will swear to tell your father the truth  that i had nothing to do with your maiming   shall we drink on it  i dont partake  you do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people  very well  my lady  may our journey continue without further incident  oh she wont be going with you  i am charged with bringing ser jaime to  you are charged with abetting treason  im afraid i must insist  youre in no place to insist on anything  i would have hoped youd learned your lesson  about overplaying your position   impossible  why  my grandson is the pride of highgarden  the most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms   your daughter  is rich  the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms  and the mother of the king  old  old  old  im something of an expert on the subject  her change will be upon her before long  ill spare you the details of what will happen then  you men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter  but this is another matter entirely  the years punish us as well i promise you that  my stomach remains quite strong however  the only thing that might turn it  are details of your grandsons nocturnal activities   do you deny them  oh not at all  a sword swallower through and through  and a boy with his affliction  should be grateful for the opportunity  to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms  and remove the stain from his name  did you grow up with boy cousins lord tywin  sons of your fathers bannermen  squires stable boys  of course  and you never  no  not once  not in any way  never  i congratulate you upon your restraint  but its a natural thing two boys having a go  at each other beneath the sheets  perhaps highgarden has a high tolerance  for unnatural behavior  i wouldnt say that  true we dont tie ourselves in knots  over a discreet bit of buggery but  brothers and sisters  where i come from that stain  would be very difficult to wash out  i will not breathe further life  into a malicious lie by discussing it  lie or not  you must admit many people find it quite convincing  convincing enough to put swords in their hands  and send them off to kill lannisters  and tyrells thanks to our new affiliation  i dont care what people believe  and neither do you  as an authority on myself i must disagree  now if the rumors about my children were true  then joffrey is no king at all  and house tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt  and if cersei is too old to give loras children  were throwing another prized flower into the dirt  it is a chance we simply cannot take  the uncertainty makes you uncomfortable  all right  ill remove it for you  if you refuse to marry loras to cersei  i will name him to the kingsguard  im sure youre familiar with the kingsguard vows  he will never marry   he will never have children  oh  the tyrell name will fade  and highgarden will go to the children  of joffrey and margaery  you would have your grandson protected  by someone who disgusts you  i would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior  who takes his vows seriously  so shall i draw up the order  or do you consent to this marriage  its a rare enough thing  a man who lives up to his reputation  no  weve gotta cut them loose  no  take my hand  thats a wonderful pin  oh its more of a brooch really  though i suppose a brooch is a sort of pin so  im very happy about  uh yes  ii am as well  i feel like im in a dream  yes me too definitely  ive dreamed of a large wedding since i was quite young  the guests  the food the tournaments  and the bride of course  the most beautiful bride in the world  in a beautiful gown of gold  and green brocade with fringed sleeves  have you ever been to highgarden my lady  no i had never left winterfell  before i came to kings landing  but it sounds wonderful  i cant wait to see it  and to leave this place  its terrible isnt it  the most terrible place there is  i dont suppose theres anything we can do about this  we can have them both killed  its hard to say which of the four of us  is getting the worst of this arrangement  probably sansa  though loras will certainly come to know  a deep and singular misery  father doesnt discriminate  were all being shipped off to hell together  on a boat you built  the tyrells were plotting to undermine our family  i did what i did to protect our family  im your family  a member of your family  who has actively contributed to that familys survival  whether or not you or father  or anyone else wants to admit it  i do admit it  if it werent for your trick with the wildfire  stannis would have sacked the city before father got here  our heads would still be rotting on the city gate  trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you  there are two people in kings landing  who can give an order to a kingsguard  did you or did you not order ser mandon  to kill me during the battle of the blackwater  the impulse i understand  he hates me because im the only one  who tells him what he really is  so fair enough he wants me dead  but his stupidity  he could have had me poisoned and no one would have known  but the king orders a kingsguard  to murder the hand of the king  in full view of his own army  the boys an idiot  what do you want me to say  i want you to tell me if my life is still in danger  probably  but not from joffrey  he wont do anything now fathers here  seven kingdoms united in fear  of tywin lannister  not the tyrells  soon they wont need to be afraid of him  joffrey will belong to margaery  the little doeeyed whore  and so will his children and their children  history will be taken from our hands  you may escape at least  once jaime gets back  ser loras may come down with a terrible case  of sword through bowels  when jaime gets back yes  but when do we think thats going to be  hes out there somewhere  jaime or not im truly fucked  whos going to tell her  do you think people will like it  i dont think they will even notice it  youre right its not my wedding  anyway from what i can tell  the dressmakers in highgarden will be far superior  to the ones in kings landing  theyd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding  loras likes green and gold brocade  im sure he does  will they let me invite my family  they havent asked my opinion  but do you think they will  no  lady sansa lord tyrion to see you   should i  i beg your pardon my lady  good afternoon lord tyrion  i was just trying on a gown for king joffreys wedding  yes it should be quite a wedding  i need to speak with you lady sansa  of course  alone if i may  why do you need to speak to her alone  shae  please excuse her lord tyrion  shes not from here  but i trust her  even though she tells me not to  sometimes we think we want to hear something  and its only afterwards when its too late  that we realize we wished wed heard it  under entirely different circumstances  its all right really  how to begin  its this  this this is awkward   taken from the hands of aegons fallen enemies  forged in the fiery breath of balerion the dread  there arent  there arent even 200  ive counted  ha im sure you have  ugly old thing  yet it has a certain appeal  the lysa arryn of chairs  shame you had to settle for your second choice  early days my friend  it is flattering really  you feeling such dread  at the prospect of me getting what i want  thwarting you has never been my primary ambition  i promise you  although who doesnt like to see their friends fail now and then  youre so right  for instance  when i thwarted your plan  to give sansa stark to the tyrells  if im going to be honest  i did feel an unmistakable sense  of enjoyment there  but your confidant  the one who fed you information about my plans  the one you swore to protect  you didnt bring her any enjoyment  and she didnt bring me any enjoyment  she was a bad investment on my part  luckily i have a friend  who wanted to try something new  something daring  and he was so grateful to me for providing  this fresh experience  i did what i did for the good of the realm  the realm  do you know what the realm is  its the thousand blades of aegons enemies  a story we agree to tell each other over and over  till we forget that its a lie  but what do we have left once we abandon the lie  chaos  a gaping pit waiting to swallow us all  chaos isnt a pit  chaos is a ladder  many who try to climb it fail  and never get to try again  the fall breaks them  and some are given a chance to climb  but they refuse  they cling to the realm  or the gods  or love  illusions  only the ladder is real  the climb is all there is
