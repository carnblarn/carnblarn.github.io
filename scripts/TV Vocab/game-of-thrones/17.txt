me crow   im a free woman  youre a free woman  i might be your prisoner but im a free woman  if youre my prisoner youre not a free woman  thats what prisoner means  and you think youre free  you swore some stupid oath  and now you can never touch a girl  it was my choice to say the words   so you dont like girls  of course i like girls  but you chose never to touch them  thats the price you pay if you want to be a man of the nights watch  so instead of getting naked with a girl  youd prefer to invade our lands  invade your lands  wildlings raid our lands all the time  some of them tried to kill my little brother a crippled boy  theyre not your lands  weve been here the whole time  you lot came along and just put up a big wall  and said it was yours  my father was ned stark  i have the blood of the first men  my ancestors lived here same as yours  so why are you fighting us  go on  now i want you to tell me what happened   guard come on this way   man screaming   come on speak up speak up   sniffs   wolfsbane  a rare substance  this is no common assassin  we hanged 20 men last night  i dont care if you hanged 100  a man tried to kill me  i want his name and i want his head  mountain we think it was an infiltrator  from the brotherhood without banners  pretentious name for a band of outlaws  we cant allow rebels behind our lines  to harass us with impunity  we look like fools and they look like heroes  thats how kings fall  i want them dead every one  killing them isnt the problem  its finding them  have you gone soft clegane  i always thought you had a talent for violence

grow  hmm  this will be my last war  win or lose  have you ever lost before  do you think id be in my position if i had lost a war  but this is the one ill be remembered for  the war of five kings theyre calling it  my legacy will be determined in the coming months  do you know what legacy means  its what you pass down to your children  and your childrens children  its what remains of you when youre gone  harren the black thought this castle would be his legacy  the greatest fortress ever built  the tallest towers the strongest walls  the great hall had 35 hearths   look at it now  a blasted ruin  do you know what happened  dragons  yes dragons happened  harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land  a million men could have marched on these walls  and a million men would have been repelled  but an attack from the air with dragon fire mm  harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls  aegon targaryen changed the rules  thats why every child alive still knows his name   aegon and his sisters  mm  it wasnt just aegon riding his dragon  it was rhaenys and visenya too  correct  a student of history are you  rhaenys rode meraxes  visenya rode vhagar  im sure i knew that when i was a boy  visenya targaryen was a great warrior  she had a valyrian steel sword she called dark sister  hmm  shes a heroine of yours i take it  arent most girls more interested  in the pretty maidens from the songs  jonquil with the flowers in her hair   most girls are idiots  ha  you remind me of my daughter  where did you learn all this stuff  about visenya and her valyrian steel sword  from my father  he was a wellread stonemason  cant say ive ever met a literate stonemason  have you met many stonemasons my lord  careful now girl  i enjoy you but be careful  take that back to the kitchen  eat what you want  and girl  mlord  lowborn girls say mlord  not my lord  if youre going to pose as a commoner  you should do it properly  my mother served lady dustin  for many years my lord  she taught me how to speak proper properly  youre too smart for your own good   has anyone told you that  yes  go on  i beg pardon ser  i should have come to you after  to thank you for saving me   you were so brave  brave  a dog doesnt need courage to chase off rats  does it give you joy to scare people  no it gives me joy to kill people  spare me you cant tell me  lord eddard stark of winterfell never killed a man  it was his duty he never liked it  is that what he told you  he lied  killing is the sweetest thing there is  why are you always so hateful  youll be glad of the hateful things i do  someday when youre queen and im all that stands  between you and your beloved king  ive demanded a meeting of the thirteen  one of them did this or knows who did  you are one of the thirteen  if i wanted your dragons i would have taken them   they mean nothing to me on their own  nothing  theyre more valuable than anything in the world  shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons  would buy me i cannot buy already  we will get them back  there is no we  so why would you help me get them back  i took you under my protection  in front of the rulers of my city  a man is what others say he is and no more  if they say that xaro xhoan daxos is a liar  my word is worth nothing  i cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof  but it did happen under your roof  khaleesi many times in my life i have been  i dont care where youve been  you think were savages because we dont live in stone castles  we cant make steel as good as yours its true but  were free  if someone tried to tell us we couldnt lie down  as man and woman  wed shove a spear up his ass  we dont go serving some shit king  whos only king because his father was  no no you serve mance rayder  the kingbeyondthewall  we chose mance rayder to lead us  he was a crow same as you  but he wanted to be free  you could be free too  you dont need to live your whole life  taking commands from old men  wake up when you want to wake up  i could show you the streams to fish the woods to hunt  build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night  youre a pretty lad  the girls would claw each others eyes out to get naked with you  walk  i could teach you how to do it  i know how to do it  you know nothing jon snow   chatter   and what did she say  she admired your spirit your grace  and what then  she uh  if every man were held accountable  for the actions of every distant relative  ser alton wed all hang  she tore the paper in half your grace  youve acted with honor  i thank you for it  lord karstark see that ser altons pen is clean  and give him a hot supper  ser altons pen is occupied your grace  the prisoners from the yellow fork  too many prisoners

woman children come inside quick  hurry up    dog barking   man cant find anything ser   theyve lost the scent  try again  weve circled this farmhouse twice  theres no sign of them  we could start the search fresh in the morning my lord  im looking at spending the rest of life  being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people  ask yourself is there anything i wouldnt do  to stop that from happening  the hounds will find the scent again  ill beat them until they do  ill whip every man here  until i have both those boys in hand  and once ive got them the pampered little shits  its better to be cruel than weak  prince theon   where are they  who mlord  the stark boys where are they  i dont know i seen no one  oh  think harder  i swear mlord i dont know  my lord over here  i think ive

slaughterhouse  i should have been here  you went to find me a ship  my place is by your side  i shouldnt have left you alone with these people  these people  they are not to be trusted  and who is to be trusted  who are my people  the targaryens  i only knew one my brother  and he would have let  if it had got him the crown  the dothraki  most of them turned on me the day that khal drogo  fell from his horse  your people are in westeros  the people in westeros dont know im alive   they will soon enough  and then what  theyll pray for my return  theyll wave dragon banners and shout my name  thats what my brother believed and he was a fool  you are not your brother  trust me khaleesi  there it is  trust me  and its you i should trust ser jorah  only you  i dont need trust any longer  i dont want it and i dont have room for it  you are too young to be so  and you are too familiar  forgive me khaleesi  no one can survive in this world without help  no one  let me help you please  tell me how  find my dragons  ygritte how long till we get back to your crows  were close  what a day a halfday  you dont know do you   do you even know where they are  were close  what do you think theyll say when they hear about you and me  nothing happened between you and me  i swear it old master king crow ser  we were only close together for warmth  and then i felt it  right up against me backside like a club  i can show you the bruise on me tailbone  and before i knew what was where his his  well it was all out in the open all angry as you like  and i didnt want to want it but oh i did  and he spread me legs and ruined  the shame of it  now i can never marry a perfumed lord  what will me poor savage father say  turn back around  and i thought that we were done but he said   deep voice  turn back around   normal voice  ill tell you what jon snow  since its going to be your word against mine  and since you cant talk about it without blushing  we may as well just  what right here in the muck  ill keep you warm enough  are you that afraid of it  thats enough  oh its nice  and wet and warm  enough  it dont have teeth  all right  all right  gods youre dull   grunting    sword rings    ygritte whistles   should have took me while you had the chance   sansa crying    sansa crying  no no    screams    laughs    screams   no oh no   whimpering   its all right give me that  if the queen sees i can have joffreys children now  help me flip it over   where are you going  to tell her grace  youll say nothing to anyone  do you understand  your mother might have prepared you  you flowered my dear no more  my mother told me but i thought it would be different  in what way  i thought it would be less  less messy  wait until you bear the child  youre a woman now  do you have any idea what that means  im fit to bear children for the king  a prospect that once delighted you  bringing little princes and princesses into the world  the greatest honor for a queen  joffrey has always been difficult  even his birth i labored a day and a half  to bring him into this world  you cannot imagine the pain  i screamed so loudly i was sure  robert would hear me in the kingswood  his grace was not with you  robert was hunting  that was his custom  whenever my time was near  my royal husband would flee to the trees  with his huntsmen and his hounds  and when he returned he would present me  with some pelts or a stags head  and i would present him with a baby  not that i wanted him there mind you  i had grand maester pycelle an army of midwives  and i had my brother  when they told jaime he wasnt allowed in the birthing room  he smiled and asked which one of them  proposed to keep him out  joffrey will show you no such devotion  you may never love the king  but you will love his children  i love his grace with all my heart  thats so very touching to hear  permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you  on this very special day  the more people you love the weaker you are  youll do things for them that you know you shouldnt do  youll act the fool to make them happy to keep them safe  love no one but your children  on that front a mother has no choice  but shouldnt i love joffrey your grace  you can try  little dove   chatter   who did you say your mother was again  cinda lannister  is she the fat one  well perhaps shes gotten a little larger than she  no no theres only one fat lannister  if she was your mother youd know it  i i squired for you once you know  when  the tournament the day of willem freys wedding  i went to willem freys wedding  you did  your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he  he threw up on his horse  on the way to the tourney grounds   what was his name  bryan   laughs  poor lad  that was my brothers doing i seem to recall  i remember you  you had never squired for anyone before  thats right i ran up and volunteered  let me my lord let me  my father was furious  afraid id embarrass our family  in front of the family  you didnt though   you really remember  mm  you knew when you were needed and when to go away  its a rare talent  most of my squires they mean well  but young men with big jobs they tend to overdo them  well when i think back to that day   hisses   you were saying  i  never mind its embarrassing  more embarrassing than being chained to a post  covered in your own shit  i remember everything about that day  your helmet your horse  the rake line in the dirt along the list  where the sun was in the sky  when you knocked balon swann from his horse  and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me  ill remember it all until i die  that was the best day of my life  and i remember being on the field after it was over  all the competitors were done  i was the last one out there  and i couldnt leave  i couldnt bring myself to go and sit with my family  at a table so far on the edge of the feast  you could barely even see the bride  and i couldnt bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you  when i knew that they could never have the faintest idea  what i was talking about  i understand completely  how could you  ssorry i i didnt mean to doubt you   its just that i  i was 16 once  i also had to replace someones squire on short notice  which knight was it  barristan selmy  the fight against the kingswood outlaws  before your time  what was he like   sighs   he was  a painter  a painter who only used red  i couldnt imagine being able to fight like that  not back then  and to help him do that to be a part of something  that perfect  i dont need to explain how that felt not to you  its hard to put into words  its like stepping into a dream  youve been dreaming for as long as you can remember  and finding out that the dream  is more real than your life  leaving that battlefield was  like being dragged off to prison   did you squire for him again  no  i didnt have your gift  he couldnt take a step without stepping on me  i was awful a complete liability  until one of the outlaws  decided to take on a 16yearold squire  its a good thing i am who i am   chuckles  id have been useless at anything else  im not wellsuited for imprisonment  shocking i know  some men are  ned stark i imagine he made  an excellent prisoner right up until the end  but me though my life has left me  uniquely unfit for constraint  have you thought about  of course   every day  and  good prisoners breed good jailers apparently  the starks are very careful  but there is a way i think  it wasnt possible until now  what is it   its actually quite simple  well let me help you  youll only have to do one thing  tell me  youll have to die   crunching    choking    bone breaks    bird screeching   jorah the andal  this man must sail past old valyria  all who travel too close to the doom must have protection  i didnt come here for lessons  no you came for the dragons  you have them  where are they  draw your sword  see what your steel is worth  you want to please the mother of dragons  you love her  where are the dragons  will you betray her again jorah the andal  will you betray her again  never  the thief you seek  is with her now  spice king i did not leave the comfort of my home  to come to yours and be called a thief  no one is calling you a thief  who is she to accuse us  please theyre my children   im begging you  begging us  it wasnt very long ago you were threatening us  without me the dragons will die  it will be for the best  your dragons will bring the world  nothing but death and misery my dear  if i knew where they were i would not tell you  pyat pree you are cruel my friend  the mother of dragons is in the right  she must be reunited with her babies   i will help you khaleesi  how  i will take you to the house of the undying  where i have put them  you have my dragons  when i learned you were coming to our city  i made an arrangement with the king of qarth   laughter   he procured them for me   but there is no king of qarth  xaro there is now  that was the other half of the arrangement  you would keep your gates and your minds closed  to everything outside your walls  but qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was  if it refuses to change  i will open qarth to the world  as i have forced it to open itself to me  your ambition is an inspiration  but like all upstarts you overreach  three dragons the size of cats  and an alliance with a charlatan  do not make you a king  an upstart and a charlatan  empires have been built by less  those on the margins often come to control the center  and those in the center make room for them  willingly or otherwise  the mother of dragons will be with her babies  she will give them her love  and they will thrive by her side  forever  a mother should be with her children  where will you run to daenerys stormborn  your dragons wait for you in the house of the undying  come see them   lady stark  no farther  keep your hands off me woman  dont enter without an invitation man  forgive me lady stark   catelyn what is it  they caught the kingslayer   men shouting    kill the fucking kingslayer  hang him   men shouting   youll die today  justice for the karstark  gut him  get back i want his head  any man who stands between a father  and his vengeance asks for death  lord karstark  this man is our prisoner  this monster killed my son  and crippled mine  he will answer for his crimes  i promise you but not here  i will have his head and if you try and stop me  you will strike me down  have you forgotten me ser  i am the widow of your liege lord eddark stark  i am the mother of your king   and where is our king now  you know very well  he has gone to the crag to accept the surrender  aye gone to the crag but not to negotiate  he brought that foreign bitch with him  how dare you  threatening my lady is an act of treason  treason  how can it be treason to kill lannisters  i understand your grief my lord  better than most i understand it  but in the name of my son the king in the north  stand down  when your son returns  i will demand this murderers head  wise men do not make demands of kings  fathers who love their sons do  i will have his head  thank you for fighting on my behalf lady stark  i would have come to your defense but  take him to the stockades  bind him with every chain you can find  youve become a real shewolf in your later years  theres not much fish left in you  and gag him  since when do you light your own candles  since i decided that i cant stand to look  at any of my handmaidens for another instant  how many times can you read one raven scroll  stannis baratheons fleet has been spotted sailing north  past tarth 200 ships   more than we have  yes thats more than we have  hell be at our gates within five days  four if he has the wind  we have strong high walls  well rain fire down on them from above  rain fire on them from above  youre quoting father arent you  why not  he has a good mind for strategy doesnt he  we call it tactics not strategy  but yes he does have a good mind for it  the best mind some would say  sadly hes not here  its just you me and joffrey  the lord of the seven kingdoms  and protector of the realm  im sure youll make a point eventually  he needs to start acting like a king  this war you started is coming to our doorstep  and if the entire city wants joffrey dead  im not the one giving the boy whores to abuse  i thought the girls might help him   did you  i was wrong  if we cant control him  do you think i havent tried  he doesnt listen to me  its hard to put a leash on a dog  once youve put a crown on its head  i always hoped hed be like jaime  he looks like him  in a certain light  the boy is more robert than jaime  robert was a drunken fool but he didnt enjoy cruelty  sometimes i wonder  what  if this is the price  for what weve done for our sins  sins  the targaryens  wed brother and sister for hundreds of years  i know  thats what jaime and i would say to each other in our moments of doubt  its what i told ned stark when he was stupid enough to confront me  half the targaryens went mad didnt they  whats the saying  every time a targaryen is born the gods flip a coin  youve beaten the odds  tommen and myrcella are good decent children  both of them   crying    why wait  were sworn to the king   theres not a king  thats treason  so is saving lannisters yeah   back off you  no i wont  your son returns at dawn my lady  so they say  brienne the kingslayer wont last the night  the more they drink the angrier theyll get  and when the karstarks draw their swords  who wants to die defending a lannister  come  i need to be alone with him   my lady our orders  your orders which i just gave you  are to leave me alone with him  come to say goodbye lady stark  i believe its my last night in this world  is that a woman  do you hear them out there  they want your head  well old lord karstark doesnt seem to like me  you strangled his son with your chains  oh oh  was he the one on guard duty   sighs   he was in my way  any knight would have done the same  you are no knight  you have forsaken every vow you ever took  so many vows  they make you swear and swear  defend the king obey the king  obey your father  protect the innocent defend the weak  but what if your father despises the king  what if the king massacres the innocent  its too much  no matter what you do youre forsaking one vow or another  where did you find this beast  she is a truer knight than you will ever be  kingslayer  kingslayer  what a king he was  heres to aerys targaryen the second of his name  lord of the seven kingdoms protector of the realm  and to the sword i shoved in his back  you are a man without honor  do you know  ive never been with any woman but cersei  so in my own way  i have more honor than poor old dead ned  what was the name of that bastard so in he fathered   brienne  no that wasnt it  snow a bastard from the north  now when when good old ned  came home with some whores baby  did you pretend to love it  no youre not very good at pretending  youre an honest woman  you hated that boy didnt you  how could you not hate him  the walking talking reminder  that the honorable lord eddark stark  fucked another woman  your sword  i told you what would happen  all of you  i told you what would happen if you served me loyally  and what would happen if you did not  what are you doing what have you done  if theres any who still question whether your new lord  means what he says  here is the answer to your question   crowd gasps murmurs   no   theme music playing
