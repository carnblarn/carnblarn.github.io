hes going to die  ser loras rides well  such a shame littlefinger  it would have been so nice for you to have a friend  and tell me lord renly  when will you be having your friend  loras knew his mare was in heat  quite crafty really  ser loras would never do that  theres no honor in tricks  no honor and quite a bit of gold  sword  leave him be  stop this madness in the name of your king  let him go  i owe you my life ser  im no ser  remove his hood  on that eve the captive imp   downwards from his horse did limp   no more would he preen and primp   in garb of red and gold   this isnt the kingsroad  you said we were riding for winterfell  i did often and loudly  very wise  theyll be out in droves  looking for me in the wrong place  words probably gotten to my father by now  hell be offering a handsome reward  everyone knows a lannister always pays his debts  would you be so good as to untie me   and why would i do that  why not  am i going to run  the hill tribes would kill me for my boots  unless a shadowcat ate me first  shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns  ah the eastern road  were going to the vale  youre taking me to your sisters  to answer for my imagined crimes  tell me lady stark when was the last time you saw your sister  five years ago  shes changed  she was always a bit touched but now  you might as well kill me here   i am not a murderer lannister  neither am i  i had nothing to do with the attempt on your sons life   the dagger found  what sort of imbecile  arms an assassin with his own blade   should i gag him  why  am i starting to make sense  rodrik  my lady this way  untie me  if i die whats the point  ah  rodrik  ill be fine my lady  theres no need to bloody yourself  your first  you need a woman  nothing like a woman after a fight  im willing if she is  bran  the iron islands  a kraken  we do not sow   lords  the greyjoys  famed for their skills at archery  navigation and lovemaking  and failed rebellions  a stag  a crowned stag now that roberts king   good  words ours is the fury   lords the baratheons  mmhmm  the westerlands   sigil a lion  mmm  a lannister always pays his debts  no  a common saying but not their official motto  the lannisters   were still on their words  i dont know them  you do know them think  unbowed unbent unbroken   thats house martell  righteous in wrath   house hornwood  family duty honor  those are tully words your mothers   are we playing a game  family duty honor   is that the right order  you know it is  family comes first  your mother had to leave winterfell  to protect the family  how can she protect the family  if shes not with her family  your mother sat by your bed  for three weeks while you slept  and then she left  when you were born i was the one  who pulled you from your mother  i placed you in her arms  from that moment until the moment she dies  she will love you  absolutely   fiercely  why did she leave  i still cant tell you   but she will be home soon  do you know where she is now  today  no i dont  then how can you promise me shell be home soon  sometimes i worry youre too smart for your own good  ill never shoot another arrow  and where is that written   you need legs to work a bow  hmm  if the saddle lord tyrion designed actually works  you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback  really  dothraki boys learn when theyre four years old  why shouldnt you  shh keep it down  youre not supposed to be inside the castle walls  i thought you were supposed to be an important person around here  important enough for the likes of you  youre not the only nobleman in my life you know  who the imp  id call him half a nobleman  jealous  why should i be jealous  anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night  whats a dwarf like down below  ive always wondered   might surprise you  hmm  hes good with his fingers too  and his tongue  generous tipper  i guess gold is cheap for a lannister  you are jealous  im a greyjoy  weve been lords of the iron islands for 300 years  theres not a family in westeros that can look down on us  not even the lannisters  and what about the starks  ive been lord starks ward since i was eight years old  a ward thats a nice word for it  your father rebelled against king robert   and if he does it again  my father fought  for the freedom of his people  what did your father do fucked a cook and whelped a whore  youre a very serious boy   im not a boy  oh yes you are  a serious boy with a serious cock  i dont want to pay for it  then get yourself a wife  come on  im not gonna hurt you  how is your son my lord  hell never walk again  but his mind is sound  so they say  a blessing then  i suffered an early mutilation myself  some doors close forever  others open in the most unexpected places  may i  if the wrong ears heard what im about to tell you  off comes my head  and who would mourn poor varys then  north or south they sing no songs for spiders  but there are things you must know  you are the kings hand and the king is a fool  your friend i know but a fool  and doomed unless you save him  ive been in the capital a month  why have you waited so long to tell me this  i didnt trust you  so why do you trust me now  the queen is not the only one  who has been watching you closely  there are few men of honor in the capital  you are one of them  i would like to believe i am another  strange as that may seem  what sort of doom does the king face  the same sort as jon arryn  the tears of lys they call it  a rare and costly thing  as clear and tasteless as water  it leaves no trace  who gave it to him  some dear friend no doubt but which one  there were many  lord arryn was a kind and trusting man  there was one boy  all he was he owed to jon arryn  the squire ser hugh  pity what happened to him  just when his life seemed to be going so nicely  if ser hugh poisoned him  who paid ser hugh  someone who could afford it  jon was a man of peace  he was hand for 17 years   why kill him  he started asking questions  mans voice hes found one bastard already  he has the book  the rest will come  man 2 and when he knows the truth what will he do  the gods alone know  the fools tried to kill his son  whats worse they botched it  the wolf and the lion will be at each others throats   we will be at war soon my friend  what good is war now  were not ready  if one hand can die why not a second  this hand is not the other  we need time  khal drogo will not make his move until his son is born  you know how these savages are  delay you say move fast i reply  this is no longer a game for two players  it never was  the first to arrive and the last to leave  i admire your industry  you do move quietly  we all have our qualities  you look a bit lonely today  you should pay a visit to my brothel this evening  first boy is on the house  i think youre mistaking business with pleasure  am i  all those birds that whisper in your ear  such pretty little things  trust me  we accommodate all inclinations  oh im sure  lord redwyne likes his boys very young i hear  im a purveyor of beauty and discretion  both equally important  though i suppose beauty is a subjective quality no  is it true that  ser marlon of tumblestone prefers amputees  all desires are valid to a man with a full purse  and i heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord  with a taste for fresh cadavers  must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination  the logistics alone  to find beautiful corpses before they rot  strictly speaking such a thing  would not be in accordance with the kings laws  strictly speaking  tell me does someone somewhere  keep your balls in a little box  ive often wondered  do you know i have no idea where they are  and we had been so close  but enough about me how have you been  since we last saw each other  since you last saw me or since i last saw you  now the last time i saw you  you were talking to the hand of the king   saw me with your own eyes  eyes i own  council business  we all have so much to discuss with ned stark  everyones well aware of your enduring fondness  for lord starks wife  if the lannisters were behind the attempt on the stark boys life  and it was discovered that you helped  the starks come to that conclusion  to think a simple word to the queen   one shudders at the thought  ooh  but you know something i do believe that i have seen you  even more recently than you have seen me   have you  yes  earlier today i distinctly recall  seeing you talking to lord stark in his chambers  was that you under the bed  and not long after that  when i saw you escorting a certain  foreign dignitary  council business  of course you would have friends from across the narrow sea  youre from there yourself after all  were friends arent we lord varys  id like to think we are  so you can imagine my burden  wondering if the king might question my friends sympathies  to stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend  turning right loyalty to the realm   oh please  to find myself in a position  where a simple word to the king  what are you two conspiring about  well whatever it is youd best hurry up  my brother is coming  to a small council meeting  disturbing news from far away  havent you heard  off with you no begging  im not a beggar i live here  dyou want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing  i want to see my father  i want to fuck the queen for all the good it does me  you want your father boy  hes lying on the floor of some tavern  getting pissed on by his friends  my father is hand of the king  im not a boy im arya stark of winterfell  and if you lay a hand on me my father  will have both your heads on spikes  now are you going to let me by or do i need to smack you  on the ear to help with your hearing  you know i had half my guard out searching for you  you promised me this would stop  they said they were going to kill you   who did  i didnt see them   but i think one was fat  oh arya  im not lying they said you found the bastard  and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage  something about the savage   where did you hear this  in the dungeons  near the dragon skulls  what were you doing in the dungeons  chasing a cat  pardon my lord  theres a nights watchman here begging a word  he says its urgent   your name friend  yoren if it please  this must be your son he has the look  im a girl  did benjen send you  no one sent me my lord  im here to find men for the wall  see if theres any scum in the dungeons  that might be fit for service  oh well find recruits for you  thank you my lord  but thats not why i disturb you now  your brother benjen his blood runs black  makes him as much my brother as yours  its for his sake i rode here so hard  i damn near killed my horse  there are others riding too  the whole city will know by tomorrow  know what  best said in private my lord  go on well talk more later  jory take her safely to her room  come along my lady you heard your father  how many guards does my father have  here in kings landing 50  you wouldnt let anyone kill him would you  no fear on that count little lady   well  its about your wife my lord  shes taken the imp  youre far from home lady stark  to whom do i speak  ser vardis egan knight of the vale  is lady arryn expecting your visit  there was no time to send word  may i ask my lady  why he is with you  thats why there was no time   he is my prisoner  he doesnt look like a prisoner  my sister will decide what he looks like  yes my lady  she will at that  the eyrie they say its impregnable  give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes  ill impregnate the bitch  i like you  lord stark your presence has been requested  in the small council chamber a meeting has been called  i need to see the king first alone  the king is at the small council meeting my lord  he has summoned you   is it about my wife  no my lord  i believe it concerns daenerys targaryen  the whore is pregnant   youre speaking of murdering a child  i warned you  this would happen back in the north i warned you  but you didnt care to hear  well hear it now  i want em dead mother and child both  and that fool viserys as well  is that plain enough for you  i want them both dead  you will dishonor yourself forever if you do this  honor  ive got seven kingdoms to rule  one king seven kingdoms  do you think honor keeps them in line  do you think its honor thats keeping the peace  its fear fear and blood  then were no better than the mad king  careful ned careful now  you want to assassinate a girl  because the spider heard a rumor  no rumor my lord the princess is with child  based on whose information  ser jorah mormont  he is serving as advisor to the targaryens  mormont you bring us the whispers  of a traitor half a world away and call it fact  jorah mormonts a slaver not a traitor  small difference i know to an honorable man  he broke the law betrayed his family fled our land  we commit murder on the word of this man  and if hes right  if she has a son  a targaryen at the head of a dothraki army   what then  the narrow sea still lies between us  ill fear the dothraki  the day they teach their horses to run on water  do nothing  thats your wise advice  do nothing till our enemies are on our shores  youre my council counsel  speak sense to this honorable fool  i understand your misgivings my lord  truly i do it is a terrible thing  we must consider a vile thing  yet we who presume to rule must sometimes  do vile things for the good of the realm  should the gods grant daenerys a son  the realm will bleed  i bear this girl no ill will  but should the dothraki invade  how many innocents will die  how many towns will burn  is it not wiser kinder even  that she should die now  so that tens of thousands might live  we should have had them both killed years ago  when you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman  best close your eyes get it over with  cut her throat be done with it  i followed you into war  twice  without doubts  without second thoughts  but i will not follow you now  the robert i grew up with  didnt tremble at the shadow of an unborn child  she dies  i will have no part in it  youre the kings hand lord stark  youll do as i command or ill find me a hand who will  and good luck to him  i thought you were a better man  out out damn you  im done with you  go run back to winterfell  ill have your head on a spike  ill put it there myself you fool  you think youre too good for this too proud and honorable  this is a war  ill go ahead with my daughters  get them ready do it yourself   dont ask anyone for help  right away my lord  lord baelish is here for you  his grace went on about you at some length  after you took your leave  the word treason was mentioned  what can i do for you  when do you return to winterfell  why what do you care  if youre still here come nightfall  ill take you to see the last person jon arryn  spoke with before falling ill  if that sort of thing still interests you  i dont have the time  it wont take more than an hour but as you please  round up all the men we have  and station them outside the girls chambers   who are your best two swords  heward and wyl  find them and meet me at the stables  you bring him here without permission  you pollute my home with his presence  your aunt has done a bad thing robin  a very bad thing  you remember her dont you  isnt he beautiful  and strong too jon knew it  his last words were the seed is strong  he wanted everyone to know  what a good strong boy his son would grow up to be  look at him the lord of all the vale  lysa  you wrote me about the lannisters   warning me  to stay away from them  not to bring one here  mommy   is that the bad man  it is  hes little  hes tyrion the imp of house lannister  he killed your father  he murdered the hand of the king  oh did i kill him too  ive been a very busy man  you will watch your tongue  these men are knights of the vale  every one of them loved jon arryn  every one of them would die for me  if any harm comes to me  my brother jaime will see that they do  you cant hurt us  no one can hurt us here tell him mommy   tell him  shh shh shh my sweet boy  hes just trying to frighten us  lannisters are all liars  no one will hurt my baby  mommy  i want to see the bad man fly  perhaps you will my little love  this man is my prisoner  i will not have him harmed  ser vardis  my sisters guest is weary  take him down below so he can rest  introduce him to mord  you go sleep dwarf man  sleep good little dwarf man  lord starks lucky he still has a head  robert will rant for a few days but he wont do anything  he adores the man  youre jealous  are you sure this wont hurt  only if i slip   and youd prefer me like this  mmhmm  if you want hairless maybe you should find a little boy  i want you  my brother thinks that anyone who hasnt been to war isnt a man  he treats me as if im a spoiled child  oh and youre not  loras tyrell the knight of the flowers  how many wars have you fought in  oh and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours  hold still  all i ever hear from robert and stannis is how im not tough enough  how i squirm at the sight of blood  you did vomit when that boys eye was knocked out in the melee  his eye was dangling out of the damn socket  he shouldnt have entered the melee if he didnt know how to fight  easy for you to say  not everyone is such a gifted swordsman  its not a gift no one gave it to me  im good because i work at it  every day of my life since i could hold a stick  i could work at fighting all day every day  and still never be as good as you  yes well i guess well never know   everywhere  everywhere  so how did it end up  the targaryen girl will die  it needs to be done unpleasant as it is  roberts rather tasteless about it  every time he talks about killing her  i swear the table rises six inches  its a shame he cant muster the same enthusiasm for his wife  he does have a deep abiding lust for her money  you have to give it to the lannisters  they may be the most pompous ponderous cunts  the gods ever suffered to walk the world  but they do have outrageous amounts of money  i have an outrageous amount of money  not as much as the lannisters  but a lot more than you  roberts threatening to take me hunting with him  last time we were out there for two weeks  tramping through the trees in the rain day after day  all so he can stick his spear into somethings flesh  oh but robert loves his killing   and hes the king  hmm   how did that ever happen  because he loves his killing  and he used to be good at it  do you know who should be king   be serious  i am  my father could be your bank  ive never fought in a war before but id fight for you  im fourth in line  and where was robert in the line of royal succession  joffrey is a monster   tommen is eight  stannis  stannis has the personality of a lobster  hes still my older brother   what are you doing  look at it  you cut me  its just blood weve all got it in us  sometimes a little spills  if you become king youre going to see a lot of this  you need to get used to it  go on look  people love you  they love to serve you because youre kind to them  they want to be near you  youre willing to do what needs to be done  but you dont gloat over it  you dont love killing  where is it written that power  is the sole province of the worst  that thrones are only made  for the hated and the feared  you would be a wonderful king  im sorry your marriage to ned stark didnt work out  you seemed so good together  im glad i could do something to make you happy  without a hand everything will fall to pieces  i suppose this is where you tell me  to give the job to your brother jaime  no  hes not serious enough  ill say this for ned stark  hes serious enough  was it really worth it losing him this way  i dont know  but i do know this  if the targaryen girl convinces her horselord husband to invade  and the dothraki horde crosses the narrow sea  we wont be able to stop them  the dothraki dont sail every child knows that  they dont have discipline they dont have armor  they dont have siege weapons  its a neat little trick you do  you move your lips and your fathers voice comes out  is my father wrong  lets say viserys targaryen lands  with 40000 dothraki screamers at his back  we hole up in our castles  a wise move only a fool  would meet the dothraki in an open field  they leave us in our castles  they go from town to town looting and burning  killing every man who cant hide behind a stone wall  stealing all our crops and livestock  enslaving all our women and children  how long do the people of the seven kingdoms stand behind  their absentee king their cowardly king  hiding behind high walls  when do the people decide that viserys targaryen  is the rightful monarch after all  we still outnumber them  which is the bigger number five or one  five  five  one  one army a real army  united behind one leader with one purpose  our purpose died with the mad king  now weve got as many armies  as there are men with gold in their purse  and everybody wants something different  your father wants to own the world  ned stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow  what do you want  we havent had a real fight in nine years  backstabbing doesnt prepare you for a fight  and thats all the realm is now  backstabbing and scheming  and arselicking and moneygrubbing  sometimes i dont know what holds it together  our marriage  ah so here we sit   holding it all together  dont you get tired  every day  how long can hate hold a thing together  well 17 years is quite a long time  yes it is  yes it is  what was she like  youve never asked about her not once  why not  at first just saying her name even in private  felt like i was breathing life back into her  i thought if i didnt talk about her  shed just fade away for you  when i realized that wasnt going to happen  i refused to ask out of spite  i didnt want to give you the satisfaction  of thinking i cared enough to ask  and eventually it became clear that my spite didnt mean anything to you  as far as i could tell you actually enjoyed it  so why now  what harm could lyanna starks ghost do to either of us  that we havent done to each other a hundred times over  you want to know the horrible truth  i cant even remember what she looked like  i only know she was the one thing i ever wanted  someone took her away from me  and seven kingdoms couldnt fill the hole she left behind  i felt something for you once you know  i know  even after we lost our first boy  for quite a while actually  was it ever possible for us  was there ever a time ever a moment  no  does that make you feel better or worse  it doesnt make me feel anything  she looks like him dont she my lord  she has his nose his black hair  aye  tell him when you see him my lord  if it please you tell him how beautiful she is  i will  and tell him ive been with no one else  i swear it my lord by the old gods and new  i dont want no jewels or nothing  just him  the king was always good to me  when jon arryn came to visit you  what did he want  he wasnt that sort of man my lord  he just wanted to know if the child was happy  healthy  he looks healthy enough to me  the girl shall want for nothing  brothels make a much better investment than ships  ive found  whores rarely sink  what do you know of king roberts bastards  well he has more than you for a start   ned how many  does it matter  if you fuck enough women some of them will give you presents  and jon arryn tracked them all down why  he was the kings hand perhaps robert wanted them looked after  he was overcome with fatherly love  come   jory  my lord  such a small pack of wolves  stay back ser this is the hand of the king  was the hand of the king  now im not sure what he is  lord of somewhere very far away  whats the meaning of this lannister  get back inside where its safe  im looking for my brother  you remember my brother dont you lord stark  blond hair sharp tongue short man  i remember him well  it seems he had some trouble on the road  you wouldnt know what happened to him would you  he was taken at my command  to answer for his crimes  my lords  ill bring the city watch  come stark  id rather you die sword in hand   if you threaten my lord again  threaten  as in im going to open your lord  from balls to brains and see what starks are made of  you kill me  your brothers a dead man  youre right  take him alive kill his men  yah  my brother lord stark  we want him back
