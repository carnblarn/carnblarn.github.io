                 theme music playing    you did this you did this   we have to leave  cersei take him take him  where is his wife  wheres sansa  find her bar the gates of the city  seize every ship in the harbor   where is she  no one leaves the capital  no one   bells tolling    get in  where are we going  somewhere safe  up you go my lady  youll be fine  youre stronger than you know   gasps    lord baelish  petyr  are you hurt my lady  good good  im sure youve had quite a fright rest easy   the worst is past  dontos lord baelish   i promised id get her to you safely  softly my friend  voices carry over water  i should get back before someone thinks to look for me  first youll want your pay   10000 was it  10000   snaps fingers   wait  groans    screams   littlefinger  shh  you dont want the queen to hear do you  are searching for you  and if they found you  how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king   i didnt murder anyone  i know i know  but you must admit it looks suspicious  the king who executed your father  who tormented you for years  and you fled the scene of his murder  why did you kill him  because he was a drunk and a fool  and i dont trust drunk fools  he saved me  saved you my lady he followed my orders  every one of them and he did it all for gold  money buys a mans silence for a time  a bolt in the heart buys it forever  he was helping me because i saved his life  yes and he gave you a priceless necklace  that once belonged to his grandmother  the last legacy of house hollard  i had it made a few weeks ago  what did i once tell you about the capital  were all liars here  come my lady  i know youve had a difficult day  but youre safe now  i promise you that  youre safe with me  and sailing home  so am i the queen  more than you were with renly  less than you would have been if joffrey had done you the courtesy  of consummating the marriage before dying  in any case this would not be an opportune moment  to press the issue  clawing at his own throat  looking to his mother to make it stop it was horrible  the world is overflowing with horrible things  but theyre all a tray of cakes next to death  they brought me your grandfathers body when he died you know  made me look at it  what was it like  they took me to the great hall and there he was  the man id married  and suffered to father my children  a great doughy lump id sat next to  at endless dinners and tedious gatherings  there he was  lying on a table  one of my husbands preferred the company of men  and was stabbed through the heart  another was happiest torturing animals  and was poisoned at our wedding feast   i must be cursed  nonsense  your circumstances have improved markedly  you may not have enjoyed watching him die  but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed  being married to him i can promise you that  but i would have been the queen  our alliance with the lannisters  remains every bit as necessary to them  as it is unpleasant for us  you did wonderful work on joffrey  the next one should be easier  tywin your brother is dead  do you know what that means  im not trying to trick you  it means ill become king  yes you will become king  what kind of king do you think youll be  a good king  mm i think so as well  youve got the right temperament for it  but what makes a good king hmm  what is a good kings single most important quality  this is hardly the place or the time  holiness  hmm  baelor the blessed was holy  and pious  he built this sept  he also named a sixyearold boy high septon  because he thought the boy could work miracles  he ended up fasting himself into an early grave  because food was of this world  and this world was sinful  justice  yeah  a good king must be just  orys i was just  everyone applauded his reforms  nobles and commoners alike  but he wasnt just for long  he was murdered in his sleep  after less than a year by his own brother  was that truly just of him  to abandon his subjects to an evil  that he was too gullible to recognize   no  no   what about strength  yes  strength  king robert was strong  he won the rebellion  and crushed the targaryen dynasty  and he attended three small council meetings  in 17 years  he spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking  until the last two killed him  so we have a man who starves himself to death  a man who lets his own brother murder him  and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing  what do they all lack   wisdom  yes  wisdom is what makes a good king  yes  but what is wisdom hmm  a house with great wealth and fertile lands  asks you for your protection  against another house with a strong navy  that could one day oppose you  how do you know which choice is wise and which isnt  youve any experience of treasuries and granaries  or shipyards and soldiers   no  no of course not  a wise king knows what he knows and what he doesnt  youre young  a wise young king listens to his counselors  and heeds their advice until he comes of age  and the wisest kings  continue to listen to them long afterwards  your brother was not a wise king  your brother was not a good king  if he had been  perhaps hed still be alive  now as the king you will have to marry  do you understand why  tommen a king needs a queen  tywin yes but why  to further the family line   do you know how that happens  yes  yes but has anyone explained the details to you  i dont think so  its all relatively straightforward   how are you  im all right  you are you will be  ill see to that  please give the queen a moment alone with her son   yes my lord  all of you   snaps fingers    doors echo shut   it was tyrion  he killed him  he told me he would  a day will come when you think you are safe and happy  and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth  thats what he said to me  you saw it  you saw joff point at him just before he  i dont know what i saw  avenge him  avenge our son  kill tyrion  tyrions my brother  our brother  therell be a trial well get to the truth of what happened  i dont want a trial  hell squirm his way to freedom given the chance  i want him dead   crying  please jaime

stranger not to kill us  in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all  im so sorry   slurping loudly   really good   did you fight at the twins  call that a fight  slaughtering livestock more like  the red wedding theyre calling it  walder frey committed sacrilege that day  he shared bread and salt with the starks he offered them guest right  guest right dont mean much anymore  it means something to me  the gods will have their vengeance  frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did  things were different when hoster tully ruled the riverlands  we had good years and bad years same as anyone  but we were safe now with the freys  raiders come plundering steal our food steal our silver  i was gonna send sally north to stay with my brother  but the norths no better the whole countrys gone sour  you got any ale  afraid not  how can a man not keep ale in his home  you look like you could really swing that sword  a real warrior with proper training  those raiders wouldnt stand a chance against you  how would it be if you stayed on till the new moon  i could use a man to help with the farmwork  sally does what she can  but she cant lift a bale of hay  and if any thieves came looking for easy pickings  one look at you id bet theyd run the other way  meaning no offense  whatll you pay  i dont have much  but i have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits  fair wages for fair work  fair wages for fair work   chickens clucking    faint voices arguing      punch lands     man groans    girl screams    man groaning    what did you do   get your horse saddled

want to protect you  ill get these to hobb  keep an eye on little sam   door closes    thunder rumbling   your grace  youre a literary man now what do you make of that   joffrey  the usurper joffrey baratheon  i said those words when i tossed a leech into the fire  a leech filled with bastard blood  a bastard you set free  i am now faced with a great opportunity  and i am powerless to take advantage of it  i will find you an army your grace   ive been working day and night  what progress have you made  ive rallied house peasebury to your cause  house peasebury   house musgood  house musgood   and house haigh  house haigh   pieces clatter   they dont have enough men between them to raid a pantry  westeros is not the world your grace  we need to look east for ships and men  fight for the golden company   the golden company  theyve never broken a contract  theyre sellswords  were willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne  but were not willing to pay men to fight  now the red womans magic is real  her visions and prophecies may be too  but ive never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war  soldiers win wars soldiers on the ground  its dirty on the ground  we dont have any gold  not yet  if i do not press my claim  my claim will be forgotten  i will not become a page in someone elses history book  im running out of time ser davos  which means youre running out of time   knocking   youre late  im sorry princess  i thought you werent coming  the hand of the king doesnt have much leisure time  you wont be a very good hand if you see the word knight and say kanigit  that happened once weeks ago  youre your fathers daughter no mistake  bloody relentless the both of you  its a new one today lots of tricky words  but i think you can manage  youll never read well if you move your lips  thats how children do it  the life and adventures of elyo grivas  first sword of braavos    claps   thank you very much  i like this one its full of sword fights and pirates  you were a pirate once  no i was never a pirate i was a smuggler  whats the difference  well if youre a famous smuggler  youre not doing it right  my father says a criminal is a criminal  your father lacks an appreciation  of the finer points of bad behavior  so do the braavosi   youve sailed to braavos  of course  almost got beheaded by a first sword of braavos  i tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers  but he didnt seem any more interested in the distinction than your father  i suppose if you work for the iron bank of braavos  and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom  you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction   what was that for  i need you to write a message  you should write it yourself its good practice  its too important for me  i need a smart person to do it go on  to the offices of the iron bank of braavos  from stannis baratheon the one true king of westeros  but thats not you  i need to get their attention  go on write   baby cooing   hes seen some adventures hasnt he   people laughing chatting    precious little thing  thank you   whats his name  sam  lovely  that the daddy  no  wheres

crying   you have to trust me  its for the best  best for you  oh gilly  please dont   baby crying    moaning   greedy  no  im sorry youre lovely  i just never acquired the taste  youre calling my beauty an acquired taste  thats quite all right lover its more for you  your loss  you like them both the same   boys and girls  does that surprise you  everyone has a preference  then everyone is missing half the worlds pleasure  the gods made that and it delights me  the gods made this  and it delights me  when it comes to war i fight for dorne  when it comes to love i dont choose sides  i hope i have as much stamina when im your age  what are you 25   children   chuckles   someday if youre lucky  you will wake up and realize you are old  that pretty ass of yours will sag  your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night  and gray hairs will sprout from your ears  no one will want you anymore  make sure you fucked your fill before that day  did you  he is a prince of dorne  girls and boys will line up  to fuck him till the day he dies  they will all have to line up behind you   door opens     prince oberyn  lord tywin  may we have the room  call my name if you need me lover  would you like to sit  no thank you  some wine  no thank you   door closes    im sorry about your grandson  are you  i dont believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father  or his grandfather  an awful way to die  which way is that  are you interrogating me lord tywin  some believe the king choked  some believe the sky is blue because we live  inside the eye of a blueeyed giant  the king was poisoned  i hear you studied poisons at the citadel  i did this is why i know  your hatred for my family is rather well known  you arrive at the capital an expert in poisoning  some days later my grandson dies of poisoning  rather suspicious  why havent you thrown me in a dungeon  you spoke with tyrion in this very brothel  on the day that you arrived  what did you discuss  you think we conspired together  what did you discuss  the death of my sister  for which you blame me  she was raped and murdered by the mountain  the mountain follows your orders  of course i blame you  here i stand unarmed unguarded  should i be concerned  you are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that  i am a man of reason  if i cut your throat today  i will be drawn and quartered tomorrow  men at war commit all kinds of crimes  without their superiors knowledge  so you deny involvement in elias murder  categorically  i would like to speak with the mountain  im sure he would enjoy speaking with you  he might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would  i could arrange for this meeting  but you want something in return  there will be a trial for my son  and as custom dictates  three judges will render a verdict  i will preside  mace tyrell will serve as the second judge  i would like you to be the third  why  not long ago the tyrells sided with renly baratheon  declared themselves enemies of the throne  now they are our strongest allies  well you made the tyrell girl a queen  asking me to judge at your sons trial isnt quite as tempting  i will also invite you to sit on the small council  to serve as one of the new kings principal advisors  i never realized you had such respect for dorne lord tywin  we are not the seven kingdoms until dorne returns to the fold  the king is dead the greyjoys are in open rebellion  a wildling army marches on the wall  and in the east a targaryen girl has three dragons  before long she will turn her eyes to westeros  only the dornish managed to resist  aegon targaryen and his dragons  youre saying you need us  that must be hard for you to admit  we need each other  you help me serve justice to the kings assassins  and i will help you serve justice to elias   door unlocks   podrick  apologies for the stench  i brought you some wine my lord but they took it from me  a noble effort  they didnt find the candles though  a quill some parchment  duck sausage almonds  and some hard cheese  youre a good lad  any word of shae  ive heard nothing my lord  i suppose thats a good thing  what are they saying about me out there  youre to stand trial in a fortnight  for murdering the king  do you believe i murdered joffrey  no my lord  you didnt  no gods no  the world is a better place without him  but i had nothing to do with it  i would like to think  if i were arranging a royal assassination  id plan it in such a way that i wouldnt be standing there  gawking like a fool when the king died  trial in a fortnight  have they announced the judges yet   your father  of course  mace tyrell  who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote  and prince oberyn of dorne  oberyn  give it to my father  he never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy  im supposed to get a list of names from you my lord  anyone who might testify on your behalf  oh i can call my own witnesses  how generous of them  very well my wife sansa  my lord shes gone   gone  no ones seen her since the wedding  you dont think she  no one had more cause to kill joffrey than sansa  but the girl is no assassin  whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it  and with my wifes disappearance it makes me seem that much more guilty   podrick  yes my lord   theyll be following you now  who will  i dont know they they the ominous they  the man pulling the strings or woman my father  maybe joffrey was too much work for him  sweet tommen will be so much easier to handle  whenever something bad happens to me  i assume its my sister that had a hand in it  but say what you will of cersei  she loves her children  she is the only one im certain had nothing to do with this murder  which makes it unique  as kings landing murders go  any other witnesses my lord  varys could vouch for me if he dared  hes already been called as a witness for the queen  of course fetch bronn i have a job for him  ive already asked my lord   they wont let him see you  why not  they say hes a known cutthroat and your close associate  hes under investigation himself  and my brother will they at least allow me to see jaime  ill ask my lord  theres something else my lord  a man i didnt know his face  he came to ask if id testify against you  said id be named ser podrick payne  if i told the judges youd bought a poison called the strangler  ser podrick payne  has a nice ring to it what did you tell him  i didnt tell them anything my lord  are you going to accept their offer  my lord  testifying against me wasnt a suggestion  if they cant tempt you with honey  theyll choose something less sweet  youve been good to me my lord  pod the trials in a fortnight  theyll want an answer before that  i already gave them an answer my lord  i will not have you dying on my behalf  do you hear me if i have to take  that long walk to the executioners block  i dont want to see your head already mounted   my lord  pod i am giving you an order  go and find my brother tell him i need him  and get yourself out of kings landing  before its too late  pod  this is farewell  farewell my lord   door opens   pod  there

aye aye  yarwyck  three dozen bodies with slit throats  tossed off the top of the wall   seems like that would be a good lesson  aye  if we go after them well be giving them what they want  they want to draw us out  pick us off a few at a time  we have just over 100 men  and thats including stewards and builders  and me we cant afford to lose a single man  we must remember our first responsibility  we are the watchers on the wall  theres got to be a way to protect them  youre a champion of the common people lord snow  what do you say to brother pyps proposition  mance rayder is coming  if the wildlings breach the wall  theyll roll over everything and everyone for 1000 miles  before they reach an army that can stop them  we need to shore up castle black  and we need to defend the wall  that is our job   horn blows   rangers returning  help him  thought youd have blue eyes by now  what took you so long   we were held up  by what  chains  we were guests of the mutineers at crasters keep   and the mutineers stayed  theyre not going anywhere  theyve got crasters food and his wives  dolorous edd poor girls  never thought theyd miss their daddy  karls running things now  hes the one who put a knife through crasters mouth  we need to ride north and kill them all  we just went over this boy   justice can wait  its not about justice  i told the wildlings we had over  karl and the others know the truth as well as we do  how long do you think theyll keep that information to themselves  when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off  mance has all he needs to crush us he just doesnt know it yet  as soon as he gets his hands on them he will  then hell throw his full strength at us  and even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings  theres still not a thing we can do to stop them  i dont think i can kill 100 wildlings   people murmuring   daenerys are they attacking  jorah a single rider  a champion of meereen  they want you to send your own champion against him
