                 youre wearing a black cloak again  ive been sent to negotiate with you  it appears my trusting nature got the better of me  its happened before  i was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us jon snow  truly i was  the halfhand ordered me to join your army  and bring back whatever information i could to castle black  he made me kill him so youd trust me  i was loyal  to him and to my nights watch vows  all your vows  she wasnt enough to turn you eh  were you enough to turn her  she put three arrows in me  when i escaped  did you see her again at castle black   yes  and  shes dead   your doing  no  well drink to her  of all the ways id kill you  poison would be the last   ygritte  ygritte  thats not wine  no its a proper northern drink jon snow  you did well fought hard  killed some of our strongest men  one of our giants went into your tunnel  and never came out again  mag the mighty  hes dead  he killed my friend grenn  he was their king  the last of a bloodline that stretches back  before the first men  grenn came from a farm   mag and grenn  grenn and mag  kullback could i trouble you for something to eat  i dont imagine our guest has eaten anything  for quite some time  so youre here to strike a bargain  turn your army around and go home  you know i know youre low on arrows  youre low on oil youre low on men  how many are left 50  i told tormund and orell  we have more than 1000 men  i showed you everything i had  the whole army 100000 strong  and what did you do you fired on us with everything you had  it wasnt much as soon as i saw that  i sent 400 men to climb the wall  an unmanned stretch five miles west of here  a lot of them will die climbing  but most of them will be over by the end of the day  its me being honest with you jon snow  which is more than youve ever done for me  my people have bled enough  were not here to conquer  were here to hide behind your wall  just like you we need your tunnel  now we both know that winter is coming  and if my people arent south of the wall when it comes in earnest  well all end up worse than dead  you want to strike a bargain with me  heres the bargain  you go back you open the gates to us  and i swear to you that no one else will die  refuse  and well kill every last man at castle black  ah  oh thats why youre here  i reckon you could do it before any of them could stop you  theyd kill you of course  theyd kill you slow  but you knew that when you came in here  are you capable of that jon snow  killing a man in his own tent when hes just offered you peace  is that what the nights watch is  is that what you are  riders coming   are you attacking us  no  its like you said we dont have the men  hold to me to me  stand down  i said my people have bled enough  and i meant it  round them up  stay with the horses  youre the kingbeyondthewall   do you know who i am  never had the pleasure  this is stannis baratheon  the one true king of the seven kingdoms  were not in the seven kingdoms and youre not dressed for this weather  it is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king  we do not kneel  ill have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall  have nowhere to put them have nothing to feed them  im not here to slaughter beat dogs  their fate depends on their king  all the same we do not kneel  take these men away  whats a man of the nights watch doing in a wildling camp  i was sent to discuss terms with the kingbeyondthewall  youre speaking to the one true king boy  you will address him as your grace  i know hes the king my father died for him  my name is jon snow your grace  im ned starks son  your father was an honorable man  he was your grace  what do you think hed have done with him  i was this mans prisoner once  he could have tortured me he could have killed me  but he spared my life  i think my father would have taken him prisoner  listened to what he had to say  very well then take him  your grace  if my father had seen the things that ive seen  hed also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall  all of them  i would suggest milk of the poppy  to ease his pain but he is completely insensate  bloody martells  the cause appears to be manticore venom  it is the deaths head manticore  yes ive read a great deal about it  its a horrible poison  usually mantari in origin  oh yes yes  theres nothing to be done  yes there is  may i ask what you think youre doing  saving him  your grace i wish it were otherwise  but ser gregor is beyond saving  well well beyond  this man is not even a maester  let alone grand maester  thats for the best  no maester knows how to save him  that is exactly the sort of arrogance  that had him expelled from the citadel your grace  his curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural  rightly so in my opinion  youre dismissed grand maester  but your grace this is my laboratory   not anymore   but i   you can save him  difficult to say your grace  but if my past work is any guide  we stand a chance  do everything you can  come to me for anything you need  thank you your grace  you should know  the process may change him  somewhat  will it weaken him  oh no  very well then  not another word  weve been over this the matters closed  im opening it again  you were betrothed to loras tyrell  youre still betrothed to loras tyrell  and you will marry loras tyrell  as soon as tommen marries margaery  i will not  jaime cannot marry or inherit lands  tyrions sentence will be carried out tomorrow  you have on several occasions made great claims  about your commitment to this familys future  your role in that future  is more vital now than it ever was  i dont care  i will stay in kings landing where i belong with my son the king  when you were nine years old i was called to the capital  i decided to take your brother with me and not you  you insisted that you would not be left at casterly rock  under any circumstances and if you recall  im not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories  about the time you won  this isnt going to be one of those times  do you think youll be the first person  dragged into a sept to be married against her will  when you marched into the throne room to tell me  wed won the battle of blackwater do you remember  i was sitting on the iron throne with tommen  i was about to give him essence of nightshade  thats how far i was willing to go when i thought  someone awful had come to take my son away  someone awful is coming to take him away   no  joffrey is dead  myrcellas been sold like livestock  and now you want to ship me off to highgarden and steal my boy  my last boy  margaery will dig her claws in  you will dig your claws in and youll fight over him  like beasts until you rip him apart  i will burn our house to the ground before i let that happen  and how will you do that  ill tell everyone the truth  what truth would that be  you dont know do you  you never believed it  how is that possible  what am i saying of course its possible  how can someone so consumed by the idea of his family  have any conception what his actual family was doing  we were right there in front of you and you didnt see us  one look in the past 20 years  one real look at your own children and you would have known  known what  everything they say is true   about jaime and me  no   your legacy is a lie  no no no no  i dont believe you  yes you do  jaime  you won  one fewer brother must be proud of yourself  theres really nothing you wouldnt do is there  for my family no nothing  i would do things for my family you couldnt imagine   tyrion is your family  hes not   you dont get to choose  i do so do you  you can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world  are you really mad enough to blame him for that  he didnt decide to kill her he was an infant  a disease doesnt decide to kill you  all the same you cut it out before it does  what do you decide what do you choose  the things i did to get back to you  to endure all that only to find you  i choose you   those are words  yes  like the ones i just said to father  i told him  told him what  i told him about us  you told him  i told him i wont marry loras tyrell  i told him im staying right here with tommen with you  you think hell just accept that  go and ask him  what did you say  i dont want to talk about tywin lannister  i dont choose tywin lannister  i dont love tywin lannister  i love my brother  i love my lover  people will whisper theyll make their jokes  let them  theyre all so small i cant even see them  i only see what matters  someone will walk in  i dont care                i can speak the common tongue if you wish  you speak it very well  before you freed me i belonged to master mighdal  i was tutor to his children  i taught them languages and history  they know a great deal about your family because of me  little calla is only seven  but she admires you very much  i hope i can prove worthy of her admiration  what can i do for you  when you took the city the children begged me  not to leave the house  but master mighdal and i agreed that i must  so i lost my home  now i live on the streets  i have outfitted mess halls  to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them  i do not mean to offend your grace  i went to one of these places  the young prey on the old  take what they want and beat us if we resist  my unsullied will make them safe again in short order  my friend this i promise you  even if they are safe who would i be there  what purpose would i serve  with my master i was a teacher  i had the respect and love of his children  what is it that you want from me  your grace i ask you  to let me sell myself back to master mighdal  you want to return to a man who owned you  like a goat or a chair  please your grace  the young may rejoice in the new world you have built for them  but for those of us too old to change  there is only fear and squalor  i am not alone  there are many outside waiting to beg the same of you  i did not take this city to preside  over the injustice i fought to destroy  i took it to bring people freedom  but freedom means making your own choices  i will allow you to sign a contract with your former master  it may not cover a period lasting longer than a year  thank you your grace  thank you  the masters will take advantage of this situation  the men serving them  will be slaves in all but name  approach my friend        i have brought you  he came from the sky  the black one  the winged shadow  he came from the sky and  my girl  my little girl  what was her name  zala your grace   how old was she  three  three          they came to us from white harbor and barrowton  from fairmarket and kings landing  from north and south  from east and west  they died protecting men women and children  who will never know their names  it is for us to remember them  our brothers  we shall never see their like again  and now their watch is ended  and now their watch is ended  your old blind man patched me up  why  hes sworn to treat all wounded men friend or foe  you want me alive so you can torture me  no ones gonna torture you  so

much time with us jon snow  you can never be a kneeler again  were gonna burn the bodies of your dead  do you want to say any words over them  words what kind of words  funeral words i dont know how
