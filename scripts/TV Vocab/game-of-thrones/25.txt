hold the crowns best interests at heart  i see and have you shared these suspicions with lord tywin  my fathers a practical man he appreciates facts  myself i often find them a hindrance  and he appreciates those who aid his family as you well know  hes almost as generous to those who help us  as he is unpleasant towards those who dont  you have a good working relationship with the tyrells  i thought you might look into it before you leave the capital   i shall do my best  thank you  and your best will prove better than when i asked you to locate arya stark  i assure you that it will  gods boy thats enough were not in a tavern   pardon my lady  no need to speak  are there any figs fetch some  i always take figs midafternoon  they help move the bowels  to what do i owe this summons  thank you for seeing me my lady  i had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters  i climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters  its the royal wedding  im told you had a hand in planning it  naturally  its shaping up to be a very involved affair  the word extravagant has been used  what good is the word extravagant  if it cant be used to describe a royal wedding   i understand that  good  but as master of coin it falls upon me  to calculate the cost for the crown  as of now its a huge expense  and  and were at war lady olenna  oh id nearly forgotten  yes and maintaining supply lines  i cant think how it slipped my mind  what is it  the tyrell family has supplied   2000 in support  provisions so this city might survive the winter  a million bushels of wheat  half a million bushels each of barley oats and rye  20000 head of cattle  50000 sheep  you dont have to lecture me about wartime expenses  im quite familiar with them  and we are so grateful for your contributions  which are necessary for the preservation of the realm  as is a royal wedding  the people are hungry for more than just food  they crave distractions  and if we dont provide them theyll create their own  and their distractions are likely to end  with us being torn to pieces  a royal wedding is much safer   wouldnt you say  i would  and traditionally paid for  by the royal family  i was told you were drunk impertinent  and thoroughly debauched  you can imagine my disappointment  at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper  where did you go for them volantis   my lady  oh very well  i wont have it said that house tyrell  refuses to play its part  well pay for half the expenses  and the celebrations will go on as planned   is that sufficient  quite sufficient thank you  very good then thats settled good day  give me that  what are you doing  just mending lord berics armor  why  im going to stay on and smith for the brotherhood  have you lost your mind  when the lannisters find this place you think theyll spare the smiths  theyll cave your head in with your own helmet  the lannisters wanted to kill me long before i joined the brotherhood  you dont have to do this  i want to  they need good men  robb needs good men too were leaving tomorrow   and then you  what serve him  ive served men my entire life  i served master mott at kings landing  and he sold me to the watch  i served lord tywin at harrenhal  wondering every day if id get tortured or killed  im done serving  you just said you were serving lord beric  he may be their leader but they chose him  these men are brothers theyre a family  ive never had a family  i can be your family  you wouldnt be my family  youd be my lady  willem  willem   is this a rescue  lannister filth take him  please i didnt do anything im just a squire  please  bring them in  is that all of them  it took five of you to murder two unarmed squires  not murder your grace  vengeance  vengeance  those boys didnt kill your sons  i saw harrion die on the battlefield and torrhen  was strangled by the kingslayer   they were his kin  they were boys  look at them  tell your mother to look at them  she killed them as much as i  my mother had nothing to do with this  this was your treason  its treason to free your enemies  in war you kill your enemies  did your father not teach you that boy  leave him  aye  leave me to the king  he wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free  thats how he deals with treason  our king in the north  or should i call him  the king who lost the north  escort lord karstark to the dungeon  hang the rest  mercy sire i didnt kill anyone  i only watched for the guards  this one was only the watcher  hang him last so he can watch the others die  please please no they made me do it  they made me they made me  word of this cant leave riverrun  they were tywin lannisters nephews  the lannisters pay their debts  they never stop talking about it  would you make me a liar as well as a murderer  it wouldnt be lying  we will bury them and remain silent  until the war is done  im not fighting for justice  if i dont serve justice to murderers in my ranks  no matter how highborn  he has to die  the karstarks are northmen  they wont forgive the killing of their lord  your mothers right  if you do this the karstarks will abandon you  you tended to their wounds  you brought them supper now theyre dead  and more boys will keep dying until this war is over  you need karstark men to end it  spare his life keep him as a hostage  a hostage  tell the karstarks that as long as they remain loyal  he will not be harmed  the blood of the first men flows through my veins  as much as yours boy  i fought the mad king for your father  i fought joffrey for you  we are kin  stark and karstark  that didnt stop you from betraying me  and it wont save you now  i dont want it to save me  i want it to haunt you to the end of your days  kneel my lord  rickard karstark  lord of karhold  here in sight of gods and men i sentence you to die  would you speak a final word  kill me and be cursed  you are no king of mine  joffrey  cersei  ilyn payne  ser meryn  the hound  what are you going to do with me  at first light well ride for riverrun  your brothers there now  hell make a contribution to our cause  and you can go home  im a hostage and youre selling me  dont think of it that way   but it is that way  it is   and it isnt  more is than isnt  beric admired your father a great deal you know  he wanted to refuse your ransom altogether   so why dont you  we need the gold  do i frighten you child  no  youre angry with me  and i dont blame you  but letting him go was the right thing  i have more reason than most to want him hanged   i thought he killed you  he did  but how  thoros  how many times have you brought me back  its the lord of light brings you back  im just the lucky drunk who says the words   how many times  five i think  no this makes six  six  there was the first time the mountain  show her  lance right through the chest  then i was stabbed in the belly  then it was an arrow in the back  and that axe in the side  then the lannisters caught me and executed me for treason  was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye  both fuckers couldnt decide  and the hound makes six  second time ive been killed by a clegane  youd think youd learn  its not getting any easier you know  i know  every time i come back  im a bit less  pieces of you get chipped away  could you bring back a man without a head  not six times just once  i dont think it works that way child  he was a good man ned stark  hes at rest now somewhere  i would never wish my life upon him  i would  youre alive  lord cast your light upon me  protect me in the darkness  burn away my sins  help me serve you  use me as you will  for the night is dark  and full of terrors  i have prayed day and night for you to come to me  my lady  i meant to come sooner   the battle  i know of your troubles my king  the lady melisandre has told me everything  yes of course  you mustnt despair your claim is true   you will be victorious  i believed that once  you are the one gods champion  and the finest man ive ever known  selyse  ive broken a sacred vow  ive sinned   no  ive wronged you   i have shamed you  youre doing gods work  you dont understand  the red woman  the lady melisandre  i know stannis  the lady melisandre has told me everything  no act done in service of the lord of light  can ever be a sin  when she told me  i wept with joy  oh my sweet boys  petyr tommard  edric  i thank god every day  for bringing melisandre to us  she gave you a son  i gave you   nothing  thats not true  so youve come to see her as well  there is no need  you must keep away from such distractions  shes my daughter  i want to see her  you are a king  you dont need my permission  under the sea   i know i know   oh oh oh   the birds have scales   and the fish take wing   i know i know   oh oh oh   shireen  father  youve grown since i last saw you  mother said you fought in a battle  did you win  no  did the onion knight come back with you  he did  he fought bravely  he hasnt come to visit me  he said hed bring me back a present from the capital  he wont be visiting child  why not hes my friend  look  he made this for me  but dont tell mother i have it  its a secret  mother doesnt like the onion knight  ser davos is a traitor  hes rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime  best forget him  not so hard youll scrub the skin off  what are you doing here  i need a bath  help me out of these rags  now get out  theres another tub  this one suits me fine  dont worry im not interested  if i faint pull me out  i dont intend to be the first lannister to die in a bathtub  why should i care how you die  you swore a solemn vow remember  youre supposed to get me to kings landing in one piece  not going so well is it  no wonder renly died with you guarding him  that was unworthy forgive me  you protected me better than most   dont you mock me  im apologizing  im sick of fighting  lets call a truce  you need trust to have a truce  i trust you  there it is theres the look  ive seen it for 17 years  on face after face  you all despise me  kingslayer  oathbreaker  a man without honor  youve heard of wildfire  of course  the mad king was obsessed with it  he loved to watch people burn  the way their skin blackened and blistered  and melted off their bones  he burned lords he didnt like  he burned hands who disobeyed him  he burned anyone who was against him  before long half the country was against him  aerys saw traitors everywhere  so he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire  all over the city  beneath the sept of baelor  and the slums of flea bottom  under houses stables taverns  even beneath the red keep itself  finally  the day of reckoning came  robert baratheon marched on the capital  after his victory at the trident  but my father arrived first  with the whole lannister army at his back  promising to defend the city against the rebels  i knew my father better than that  hes never been one to pick the losing side  i told the mad king as much  i urged him to surrender peacefully  but the king didnt listen to me  he didnt listen to varys who tried to warn him  but he did listen to grand maester pycelle  that grey sunken cunt  you can trust the lannisters he said  the lannisters have always been  true friends of the crown  so we opened the gates  and my father sacked the city  once again i came to the king  begging him to surrender  he told me to  bring him my fathers head  then he  turned to his pyromancer  burn them all he said  burn them in their homes  burn them in their beds  tell me if your precious renly  commanded you to kill your own father  and stand by while thousands of men  women and children burned alive  would you have done it  would you have kept your oath then  first i killed the pyromancer  and then when the king turned to flee  i drove my sword into his back  burn them all he kept saying  burn them all  i dont think he expected to die  he he meant to  burn with the rest of us  and rise again  reborn as a dragon  to turn his enemies to ash  i slit his throat to make sure that didnt happen  thats where ned stark found me  if this is true  why didnt you tell anyone  why didnt you tell lord stark  stark  you think  the honorable ned stark  wanted to hear my side  he judged me guilty  the moment he set eyes on me  by what right does the wolf  judge the lion   by what right  help help  the kingslayer  jaime  my name is jaime  onion knight  ser onion knight  princess gods what are you doing here   shh youll wake bert  bert  hes the fat one hes on guard duty tonight  he likes to drink wine and sleep a lot  go back to your room youre not supposed to be here   if your father knew  he said you were a traitor  are you  i am child  i disobeyed my king your father  and now im paying the price  i dont care youre my friend  you must get bored down here  i brought you something to read  its about aegon and his dragons  aegon used to live here did you know that   and the targaryens built this castle  aye   so they did  you can hide the book under your cloak  its a good one ill bring you more  thank you my lady im sure its a fine book  but its wasted on me  take it i have more  my lady i cant read the words  you cant  ill teach you ill come when berts on duty and teach you   no no no  its easy itll be fun   go we cant  why not  what will they do lock us in cells  i wouldnt know where to start  at the beginning  this word is aegon  when you see a e and g together like that  it sounds like egg  and the title of the whole book  is an history of aegon the conqueror  and his conquest of westeros  it was a bitch of a siege  mm you were first through the breach at pyke  the second thoros of myr went in alone  waving that flaming sword of his  thoros of myr bloody madman  robert knighted you after the battle  proudest moment of my life  one knee in the dust the kings sword on my shoulder  listening to the words  in the name of the warrior i charge you to be brave  all i could think of was how badly i had to piss  in full plate metal for 16 hours  never occurred to me till the fighting was over  i was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the kings boots  robert would have laughed  he was a good man a great warrior  and a terrible king  i burned away my years fighting for terrible kings   you swore an oath  yes  and a man of honor keeps his vows  even if hes serving a drunk or a lunatic  just once in my life before its over  i want to know what its like to serve with pride  to fight for someone i believe in  do you believe in her  with all my heart  these are the ones  yes khaleesi the officers  all unsullied boys are given new names  when they are cut  grey worm red flea black rat  names that remind them what they are  vermin  king robert wanted her dead  of course he wanted her dead  shes a targaryen the last targaryen  i suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him   i didnt sit on the small council  no  doesnt the lord commander of the kingsguard traditionally  traditionally yes but i killed a dozen  of roberts friends during his rebellion  he didnt want advice on how to govern  from a man who had fought for the mad king  cant say i minded much  i always hated the politics  yeah i imagine i would too  hours spent jabbering about backstabbings   and betrayals the world over  mmhmm  still shell have to wade through that muck  if she wants to rule the seven kingdoms  shell have good men around her to advise her  men with experience  which men do you have in mind  forgive me ser jorah for what im about to say  but your reputation in westeros has suffered over the years  it suffered for a reason  i sold men into slavery  i dont know if your presence by her side  will help our cause when we go home  our cause  forgive me ser barristan but i was busy  defending the khaleesi against king roberts assassins  while you were still bowing to the man  we both want her to rule am i wrong  you only joined us a few days ago  i cant speak to your intentions  if were truly her loyal servants  we will do whatever needs to be done  no matter the cost no matter our pride  youre not lord commander here  youre just another exile  and i take my orders from the queen   come to bed  you were right  the karstarks are gone  almost half our forces  tywin lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel  nothing  only wait  dont let him  what can i do  attack kings landing  theres nothing hed like better  hed crush us in a day  we could ride north  take your land back from the greyjoys   wait out the winter  winter could last five years  once my bannermen are home again  sitting by the fire surrounded by their families  warm and safe theyll never ride south again  when i gathered my lords together  we had a purpose a mission  now were like a band of bickering children  give them a new purpose  what  oh i dont know  i dont even know where winterfell is  here  and were here kings landing  what is it  i cant force them to meet us in the field  and i cant attack them where theyre strongest  but i can attack them where theyre not  and casterly rock cant run away  im going to take their home away from them  can you do it  i need men to replace the karstarks who marched home  there is only one person in this kingdom  with that kind of army who hasnt already sided with the lannisters  the man whose daughter i was supposed to marry  walder frey  hes such a splendid fighter  do you have any idea when we might  ill plant the seed as soon as joffrey and i are married  it should grow quickly  joffrey wont let me leave  hes got too many reasons to keep me here  and only one to let you go  because it will please me  squire  well fought ser  that was no fight i dont know you  olyver if it please you  i should like to see you spar with a proper partner ser  how did you know  know what  that i wanted to  my lord  ill have you know im to be married soon  and even my intended hasnt the slightest notion  they rarely do in my experience  you have a good deal of experience do you  with the husbands  that didnt take long  well it took long enough  it seems our knight of flowers is engaged to be wed  is he  and  whos the lucky girl  she may not be the grandest ship in the world  or the fastest  but shes mine  ive always wanted a ship  now i want a dozen   strange isnt it  what is  it doesnt matter what we want  once we get it  then we want something else  your hair is different  is it  lady margaery wears it that way  many ladies wear it this way  i have good news  ill be leaving the city soon  you still want me to come with you  its not a question of what i want  its what you want  you want to go home dont you  of course more than anything  but maybe it would be better to wait  ive been thinking how dangerous it would be  not just for me but for you  youve been so kind  id feel terrible if anything happened to you  i cant tell you how touched i am  by your concern for my welfare  i hope you know that im your friend sansa  your true friend  i do lord baelish   petyr  petyr  if you wish to stay  then of course you will stay  well speak again when i return  youre late  whats she doing here  our business concerns her too  sit  youll be pleased to learn  that after one conversation with olenna tyrell  ive saved the crown  hundreds of thousands on this wedding  never mind that now  we have something important to discuss  im master of coin saving money is important  stop that  youre making me uncomfortable  your sister has learned that your new friends the tyrells  are plotting to marry sansa stark to ser loras  very well  shes a lovely girl  missing some of loras favorite bits  but im sure theyll make do   your jokes are not appreciated  it wasnt my best but  i bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me  by trying to steal the key to the north out from under me  sansa is the key to the north  i seem to remember she has an older brother  the karstarks have marched home  the young wolf has lost half his army his days are numbered  theon greyjoy murdered both his brothers  that makes sansa stark the heir to winterfell  and i am not about to hand her over to the tyrells  the tyrell army is helping us to win this war  do you really think its wise to refuse them  theres nothing to refuse this is a plot  plots are not public knowledge  and the tyrells wont carry this one out  until after joffreys wedding  we need to act first and kill this union in its crib  and how do we do that  we find sansa stark a different husband   wonderful  yes it is  you cant mean it  i can and i do  joffrey has made this poor girls life miserable  since the day he took her fathers head  now shes finally free of him and you give her to me  thats cruel even for you  do you intend on mistreating her  the girls happiness is not my concern   nor should it be yours  shes a child  shes flowered i assure you she and i have discussed it at length  there you see you will wed her bed her and put a child in her   surely youre capable of that  and if i refuse  you wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle  sansa stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for  and it is past time you were wed  i was wed  or dont you remember  only too well  you should be thanking the gods for this  this is more than you deserve  tyrion will do as hes bid  as will you  what do you mean  youll marry ser loras   i will not  the boy is heir to highgarden  tyrion will secure the north you will secure the reach   no i wont do it  yes you will  youre still fertile you need to marry again and breed  i am queen regent not some broodmare  youre my daughter  you will do as i command  and you will marry loras tyrell  and put an end to the disgusting rumors  about you once and for all  father dont make me do it again please  not another word  my children  youve disgraced the lannister name for far too long   its always summer   under the sea   i know i know   oh oh oh   the birds have scales   and the fish take wing   i know i know   oh oh oh   the rain is dry   and snow falls up   i know i know   oh oh oh   the stones crack open   the water burns
