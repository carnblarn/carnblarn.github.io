brave man terrible judgment  attacking him was stupid  lannisters  dont act like fools  are you gonna say something clever  go on say something clever  catelyn stark took my brother  why is he still alive   tyrion  ned stark  one of our men interfered  speared him through the leg before i could finish him  why is he still alive   it wouldnt have been clean  clean  you spend too much time worrying about  what other people think of you  i could care less what anyone thinks of me  thats what you want people to think of you  its the truth  when you hear them whispering  kingslayer behind your back  doesnt it bother you  of course it bothers me  the lion doesnt concern himself  with the opinions of the sheep  i suppose i should be grateful that your vanity  got in the way of your recklessness  im giving you half of our forces   you will bring them to catelyn starks girlhood home  and remind her that lannisters  pay their debts  i didnt realize you placed such a high value on my brothers life  hes a lannister  he might be the lowest of the lannisters but hes one of us  and every day that he remains a prisoner  the less our name commands respect  so the lion does concern himself with the opinions of  no its not an opinion its a fact  if another house can seize one of our own  and hold him captive with impunity  we are no longer a house to be feared  your mothers dead  before long ill be dead  and you  and your brother and your sister  and all of her children all of us dead  all of us rotting in the ground  its the family name that lives on  its all that lives on  not your personal glory not your honor  but family  do you understand  hmm  youre blessed with abilities that few men possess  you are blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the kingdoms  and you are still blessed with youth  and what have you done with these blessings huh  youve served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings  one a madman the other a drunk  the future of our family will be determined in these next few months  we could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years  or we could collapse into nothing as the targaryens did  i need you to become the man you were always meant to be  not next year not tomorrow  now  youre in pain  ive had worse my lady  perhaps its time to go home  the south doesnt seem to agree with you  i know the truth jon arryn died for  do you lord stark  is that why you called me here to pose me riddles  has he done this before  jaime would have killed him  my brother is worth a thousand of your friend  your brother  or your lover  the targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years  to keep bloodlines pure  jaime and i are more than brother and sister  we shared a womb  we came into this world together we belong together  my son saw you with him  do you love your children   with all my heart  no more than i love mine   and they are all jaimes  thank the gods  in the rare event that robert leaves his whores  for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed  i finish him off in other ways   in the morning he doesnt remember  youve always hated him  hated him i worshipped him  every girl in the seven kingdoms dreamed of him  but he was mine by oath  and when i finally saw him  on our wedding day in the sept of baelor  lean and fierce and blackbearded  it was the happiest moment of my life  then that night he crawled on top of me stinking of wine  and did what he did what little he could do  and whispered in my ear lyanna  your sister was a corpse and i was a living girl  and he loved her more than me  when the king returns from his hunt ill tell him the truth  you must be gone by then you and your children  i will not have their blood on my hands  go as far away as you can  with as many men as you can  because wherever you go  roberts wrath will follow you  and what of my wrath lord stark  you should have taken the realm for yourself  jaime told me about the day kings landing fell  he was sitting in the iron throne and you made him give it up  all you needed to do was climb the steps yourself  such a sad mistake  ive made many mistakes in my life  but that wasnt one of them  oh but it was  when you play the game of thrones you win  or you die  there is no middle ground  come here  oh yes oh  oh yes yes yes  no no no no  is that what they teach you up in the north  and you wherever youre from  do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound  either of you understand a thing that im saying  yes my lord  lets start over shall we  you be the man  and you be the woman  well go ahead  slowly  youre not fooling them they just paid you  they know what you are  they know its all just an act  your job is to make them forget what they know  that takes time  you need to  ease into it  go ahead  ease into it  hes winning you over in spite of yourself  youre starting to like this  he wants to believe you  hes enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it  why shouldnt you he knows hes better than other men  hes always known it deep down inside now he has proof  hes so good  hes reaching something deep inside of you that  no one even knew was there  overcoming your very nature  why dont you join us my lord  im saving myself for another  what she doesnt know wont hurt her  a stupid saying  what we dont know is usually what gets us killed  she must be very beautiful  no not really impeccable bloodlines though  i do believe my lords in love  for many years most of my life really  play with her ass  and she loved me too  i was her little confidant  her plaything  she could tell me anything anything at all  she told me about all the horses that she liked  the castle she wanted to live in and the man  that she wanted to marry  a northerner with a jaw like an anvil  so i challenged him to a duel  i mean why not id read all the stories  the little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories  in the end she wouldnt even let him kill me  hes just a boy she said  please dont hurt him  so he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by   and off they went  is she still married to him  oh no  he got himself killed before the wedding  and she ended up with his brother  an even more impressive specimen  she loves him im afraid  and why wouldnt she i mean who could compare to him  hes just so  good  do you know what i learned losing that duel  i learned that ill never win  not that way thats their game  their rules  im not going to fight them  im going to fuck them thats what i know  thats what i am  and only by admitting what we are can we get what we want  and what do you want  oh everything my dear  everything there is  now wash yourselves both of you are working tonight  hmm  youre a very lucky girl do you know that  where i come from we dont show mercy to criminals  where i come from if someone like you attacked a little lord  at low tide wed lay you on your back on the beach  your hands and feet chained to four stakes  the sea would come in closer and closer  youd see death creeping toward you a few inches at a time  where is it you come from  the iron islands  they far away  youve never heard of the iron islands  trust me youve never heard where im from neither  trust me my lord  youre not living in the wilderness anymore  in civilized lands you refer to your betters  by their proper titles   and whats that  lord  why  why  what do you mean why  my father is balon greyjoy lord of the iron islands  whats that got to do with you  if your fathers lord  how can you be lord too  i will be lord after my father  so youre not lord now  no you  you having a go at me is that it  i just dont understand how you southerners do things   im not a southerner  youre from south of the wall  that makes you a southerner to me  youre an impudent little wench arent you  couldnt say my lord  dont know what impunent means  impudent it means rude  disrespectful  do you want to lose that chain  theon greyjoy  the lady is our guest  i thought she was our prisoner  are the two mutually exclusive in your experience  chances are i wont be nearby the next time that happens  im used to worse than him  im used to men who could chew that boy up  and pick their teeth with his bones  why did you come here  didnt mean to come here  meant to get much further south than this  as far south as south goes  before the long night comes  why what are you afraid of  theres things that sleep in the day   and hunt at night  owls and shadowcats and  im not talking about owls and shadowcats  the things you speak of  theyve been gone for thousands of years  they wasnt gone old man  they was sleeping  and they aint sleeping no more  i miss girls  not even talking to them i never talked to them  just looking at them  hearing them giggle  dont you miss girls  riders  the horn we have to blow the horn  why is he alone  one blast for a ranger returning  two for wildlings   three for  theres no rider  whoa boy whoa  thats my uncle benjens horse  wheres my uncle  ned  its robert we were hunting  a boar  i should have spent more time with you  shown you how to be a man  i was never meant to be a father  go on  you dont want to see this  my fault  too much wine missed my thrust  it stinks  it stinks like death  dont think i cant smell it  i paid the bastard back ned  i drove my knife right through his brain  you ask them if i didnt ask them  i want the funeral feast to be the biggest  the kingdoms ever saw  and i want everyone to taste the boar that got me  now leave us the lot of you i need to talk to ned   robert my sweet  out all of you  you damned fool  paper and ink on the table  write down what i say  in the name of robert of the house baratheon  first of you know how it goes  fill in the damn titles  i hereby command  eddard of house stark  titles titles  to serve as lord regent and protector of the realm  upon my death  to rule in my stead  until my son joffrey comes of age  give it over  give it to the council  after im dead  at least theyll say i did this right  this one thing  youll rule now  youll hate it worse than i did  but youll do it well  the girl  daenerys  you were right varys littlefinger  my brother worthless  no one to tell me no but you  only you  let her live  stop it if its not too late  i will  and my son  help him ned  make him better than me  ill  ill do everything i can to honor your memory  my memory  king robert baratheon  murdered by a pig  give me something for the pain and let me die  give him milk of the poppy  he was reeling from the wine  he commanded us  to step aside but  i failed him  no man could have protected him from himself  i wonder ser barristan  who gave the king this wine  his squire from the kings own skin  his squire the lannister boy  such a dutiful boy to make sure his grace  did not lack refreshment  i do hope the poor lad does not blame himself  his grace has had a change of heart  concerning daenerys targaryen  whatever arrangements you made  unmake them at once  im afraid  those birds have flown  the girl is likely dead already  throne  throne  cant you help me make him understand  the dothraki do things in their own time for their own reasons  have patience khaleesi we will go home i promise you  my brother was a fool i know  but he was the rightful heir to the seven kingdoms  have i said something funny ser  forgive me khaleesi but your ancestor aegon the conqueror  didnt seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right  he had no right to them he seized them because he could  and because he had dragons  ah well having a few dragons makes things easier   you dont believe it  have you ever seen a dragon khaleesi  i believe what my eyes and ears report  as for the rest it was 300 years ago  who knows what really happened  now if youll pardon me ill seek out the merchant captain  see if he has any letters for me   ill come with you  no no dont trouble yourself  enjoy the market ill rejoin you soon enough  psst jorah the andal  the spider sends his greetings  and his congratulations  a royal pardon you can go home now  virzetha gizikhven mra qora mra qora  my son already has his name but ill try your summerwine  just a taste  my lady you are from westeros  you have the honor of addressing daenerys of the house targaryen  khaleesi of the riding men and princess of the seven kingdoms   princess  rise  id still like to taste that wine  that dornish swill  not worthy of a princess  i have a dry red from the arbor  nectar of the gods  let me give you a cask uh a gift  you honor me ser  the honor the honor is all mine  huhuh huhuh  there are many in your homeland that pray for your return princess  i hope to repay your kindness someday   rakharo  huh   is something wrong  i have a thirst  open it  the wine is for the khaleesi its not for the likes of you  open it  pour  it would be a crime to drink a wine this rich  without at least giving it time to breathe  do as he says  as the princess commands  sweet isnt it  can you smell the fruit ser  taste it my lord  tell me that that is not the finest wine  that has ever touched your tongue  you first  me  im afraid i am not worthy of the vintage  besides it is a poor wine merchant who would  drink up his own wares  you will drink   khaleesi  stop him  come  you came to us as outlaws  poachers rapers  killers thieves  you came alone in chains  without friends  nor honor  you came to us rich and you came to us poor  some of you bear the names of proud houses  others only bastard names or no names at all  it does not matter  all that is in the past  here  on the wall  are all one house   tonight  youre allowed to look happy  youre going to be a ranger  isnt that what you always wanted  i want to find my uncle  i know hes alive out there  i know he is  i wish i could help you but im no ranger  its the stewards life for me  theres honor in being a steward  not much really  but theres food  here you begin anew  a man of the nights watch  lives his life for the realm  not for a king  or a lord or the honor of this house  or that house  not for gold nor glory  nor a womans love  but for the realm  and all the people in it  youve all learned the words of the vow  think carefully before you say them  the penalty for desertion  is death  you can take your vows here  tonight at sunset  do any of you still keep the old gods  i do my lord  youll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your uncle did  yes my lord  youll find a weirwood a mile north of the wall  and your old gods too maybe  my lord might i go as well  does house tarly keep the old gods  no my lord  i was named in the light of the seven  as my father was and his father before him  why would you forsake the gods of your father and your house  the nights watch is my house now  the seven have never answered my prayers  perhaps the old gods will  as you wish lad  youve all been assigned an order  according to our needs  and your strengths  halder to the builders  pyp to the stewards  toad to the builders grenn to the rangers  samwell to the stewards  matthar to the rangers dareon to the stewards  balian to the rangers  rast to the rangers  jon to the stewards  rancer to the builders  echiel to the builders  gordo to the stewards  niko to the rangers escan to the rangers  vorkoy to the builders joby to the stables  mink to the kitchens allo to the builders  nelugo to the rangers  may all the gods preserve you  rangers with me  builders  samwell you will assist me in the rookery and library  pyp you will report to bowen marsh in the kitchens  luke report to oneeyed joe in the stables  dareon we are sending you to eastwatch  present yourself to borcas when you arrive  make no comment about his nose  jon snow lord commander mormont  has requested you for his personal steward  will i serve the lord commanders meals  and fetch hot water for his bath  certainly  and keep a fire burning in his chambers  change his sheets and blankets daily  and do everything else the lord commander requires of you  do you take me for a servant  we took you for a man of the nights watch  but perhaps we were wrong in that   may i go  as you wish  jon wait  dont you see what theyre doing  i see ser allisers revenge thats all  he wanted it and he got it  stewards are nothing but maids  im a better swordsman and rider than any of you   its not fair  fair  i was singing for a high lord at acorn hall  when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock  i pushed him away and he said hed have my hands cut off  for stealing their silver  so now im here at the end of the world  with no one to sing for  but old men and little shits like you  ill never see my family again  ill never be inside a woman again  so dont tell me about fair  i thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese  for your starving sister  you think i was gonna tell a bunch of strangers  that a high lord tried to grab my cock  could you sing me a song pyp id like to hear a song  now listen to me  the old man is the lord commander of the nights watch  youll be with him day and night  yes youll clean his clothes  but youll also take his letters attend him at meetings  squire for him in battle  youll know everything be part of everything  and he asked for you himself  he wants to groom you for command  i just  i always wanted to be a ranger  i always wanted to be a wizard  what  no im serious  so youll stay and say your words with me  lord stark a moment  alone if you will  he named you protector of the realm  he did  she wont care  give me an hour and i can put a hundred swords at your command  and what should i do with a hundred swords  strike tonight while the castle sleeps  we must get joffrey away fro his mother and into our custody  protector of the realm or no he who holds the king holds the kingdom  every moment you delay gives cersei another moment to prepare  by the time robert dies it will be too late for the both of us  what about stannis  saving the seven kingdoms from cersei and delivering them to stannis  you have odd notions about protecting the realm  stannis is your older brother  this isnt about the bloody line of succession  that didnt matter when you rebelled against the mad king  it shouldnt matter now  whats best for the kingdoms  whats best for the people we rule  we all know what stannis is  he inspires no love or loyalty  hes not a king  i am  stannis is a commander  hes led men into war twice  he destroyed the greyjoy fleet  yes hes a good soldier everyone knows that  so was robert  tell me something  do you still believe good soldiers make good kings  i will not dishonor roberts last hours  by shedding blood in his halls  and dragging frightened children from their beds  you will sail to dragonstone tonight  you will place this in the hand of stannis baratheon  not his steward  not his captain of the guard  and not his wife  only stannis himself  yes my lord  now leave us  my lord protector  the king has no trueborn sons  joffrey and tommen  are jaime lannisters bastards   so when the king dies  the throne passes  to his brother lord stannis  so it would seem   unless  there is no unless  he is the rightful heir nothing can change that  and he cannot take the throne without your help  you would be wise to deny it to him  and to make sure joffrey succeeds  do you have a shred of honor  you are now hand of the king and protector of the realm  all of the power is yours you need only  reach out and take it  make peace with the lannisters  release the imp wed your daughter to joffrey  we have plenty of time to get rid of stannis  and if joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he  comes into his throne  we simply reveal his little secret  and seat lord renly there instead  we  youll need someone to share these burdens  i assure you my price would be modest  what you suggest is treason  only if we lose  make peace with the lannisters you say  with the people who tried to murder my boy  we only make peace with our enemies my lord  thats why its called making peace  no i wont do it  so it will be stannis and war  there is no other choice  he is the heir  so why did you call me here  not for my wisdom clearly  you promised catelyn you would help me  the queen has a dozen knights and a hundred menatarms  enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard  i need the gold cloaks  the city watch is 2000 strong  and sworn to defend the kings peace  look at you  you know what you want me to do  you know it has to be done  but its not honorable so the words stick in your throat  when the queen proclaims one king  and the hand proclaims another  whose peace do the gold cloaks protect  who do they follow  the man who pays them  hear my words and bear witness to my vow  night gathers and now my watch begins  it shall not end until my death  i shall take no wife  hold no lands father no children  i shall wear no crowns and win no glory  i shall live and die at my post  i am the sword in the darkness  i am the watcher on the walls  i am the shield that guards the realms of men  i pledge my li and honor to the nights watch  for this night and all the nights to come  you knelt as boys  rise now as men of the nights watch  well done well done  whats he got there  to me ghost bring it here  gods be good  what will they do to him  when the khalasar rides hell be leashed to a saddle  forced to run behind the horses for as long as he can  and when he falls  i saw a man last nine miles once  king robert still wants me dead  this poisoner was the first he wont be the last  i thought hed leave me alone  now that my brother is gone  he will never leave you alone  if you ride to darkest asshai his assassins will follow you  if you sailed all the way to the basilisk isles  his spies would tell him  he will never abandon the hunt  youre a targaryen the last targaryen  your son will have targaryen blood  with 40000 riders behind him  he will not have my son  he will not have you either khaleesi  lord stark   stop  ned no all right  its all right let him through  lord stark king joffrey and the queen regent  request your presence in the throne room  king joffrey  king robert is gone  the gods give him rest  all is accomplished the city watch is yours  good  is lord renly joining us  i fear lord renly has left the city  he rode through the old gate  an hour before dawn  with ser loras tyrell and some 50 retainers  last seen galloping south in some haste  we stand behind you lord stark  all hail his grace  joffrey of houses baratheon and lannister  the first of his name  king of the andals and the first men  lord of the seven kingdoms  and protector of the realm  i command the council to make all necessary arrangements  for my coronation  i wish to be crowned within the fortnight  today i shall accept oaths of fealty  from my loyal councilors  ser barristan  i believe no man here could ever question your honor  king roberts seal unbroken  lord eddard stark is herein named  protector of the realm  to rule as regent  until the heir come of age  may i see that letter ser barristan  protector of the realm  is this meant to be your shield lord stark  a piece of paper   those were the kings words  we have a new king now  lord eddard when we last spoke you offered me some counsel  allow me to return the courtesy  bend the knee my lord  bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son  and we shall allow you to live out your days  in the gray waste you call home  your son has no claim to the throne  liar  you condemn yourself with your own mouth lord stark  ser barristan seize this traitor  ser barristan is a good man a loyal man do him no harm  you think he stands alone  kill him kill all of them i command it  commander  take the queen and her children into custody  escort them back to the royal apartments  and keep them there under guard  men of the watch  i want no bloodshed  tell your men to lay down their swords  no one needs to die  now  i did warn you not to trust me
