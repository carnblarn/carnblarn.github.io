king renly and move south  to join our forces with his  renly is not the king  you cannot mean to hold to joffrey my lord  he put your father to death  that doesnt make renly king  hes roberts youngest brother  if bran cant be lord of winterfell before me  renly cant be king before stannis  do you mean to declare us for stannis   renly is not right  my lords  if we put ourselves behind stannis  my lords  here is what i say to these two kings  renly baratheon is nothing to me  nor stannis neither  why should they rule over me and mine  from some flowery seat in the south  what do they know of the wall or the wolfswood  even their gods are wrong  why shouldnt we rule ourselves again  it was the dragons we bowed to  and now the dragons are dead  there sits the only king  i mean to bend my knee to  the king in the north  ill have peace on those terms  they can keep their red castle  and their iron chair too  the king in the north  am i your brother now and always  now and always  my sword is yours in victory and defeat  from this day until my last day  the king in the north  the king in the north the king in the north  the king in the north  the king in the north the king in the north  the king in the north  the king in the north  the king in the north  the king in the north  the king in the north the king in the north   lady stark  i want to see him  now  leave us  you look lovely tonight lady stark  widowhood becomes you  your bed must be lonely  is that why you came  im not at my best  but i think i could be of service  you slip out of that gown and well see if im up to it  oh i do like a violent woman  i will kill you tonight ser  pack your head in a box and send it to your sister  let me show you how  hit me again over the ear  and again and again  youre stronger than you look it shouldnt take long  that is what you want the world to believe  isnt it that you dont fear death  but i dont my lady  the dark is coming for all of us why cry about it  because you are going to the deepest  of the seven hells if the gods are just  what gods are those  the trees your husband prayed to  where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off  if your gods are real and if they are just  why is the world so full of injustice  because of men like you  there are no men like me  only me  my son bran  how did he come to fall from that tower  i pushed him out the window  why  i hoped the fall would kill him  why  you should get some sleep  its going to be a long war  i cant believe were actually at war  was it this exciting last time when you were young  what does it say  have we captured robb stark yet   whats our next move  stop talking  get back into bed  they have my son  the stark boy appears to be less green than wed hoped  ive heard his wolf killed a doze men and as many horses  is it true about stannis and renly  both baratheon brothers have taken up against us  jaime captured his armies scattered  its a catastrophe  perhaps we should sue for peace  theres your peace  joffrey saw to that when h decided to remove ned starks head  youll have an easier time drinking from that cup  than you will bringing robb stark to the table now  hes winning  in case you hadnt noticed  im told we still have his sisters  the first order of business is ransoming ser jaime  no truces we cant afford to look weak  we should march on them at once  first we must return to casterly rock to raise  they have my son  get out all of you  not you  you were right about eddard stark  if he were alive we could have used him  to broker a peace with winterfell and riverrun  which would have given us more time  to deal with roberts brothers but now  madness madness and stupidity  i always thought you were a stunted fool  perhaps i was wrong  half wrong  im new to strategy but  unless we want to be surrounded by three armies  it appears we cant stay here  no one will stay here  ser gregor will head out with 500 riders  and set the riverland on fire from gods eye to the red fork  the rest of us will regroup at harrenhal  and you will go to kings landing  and do what  rule  you will serve as hand of the king in my stead  you will bring that boy king to heel and his mother too if needs be  and if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest   baelish varys pycelle  heads spikes walls  why not my uncle  why not anyone why me  youre my son  oh one more thing  you will not take the whore to court  do you understand  ser jorah  gently gently  my son  where is he i want him  where is he  the boy did not live   tell me  what is there to tell  how did my son die  he never lived my princess  the women say  what do the women say   they say the child was  monstrous  twisted  i pulled him out myself  he was scaled like a lizard  blind with leather wings like the wings of a bat  when i touched him the skin fell from his bones  inside he was full of graveworms  i warned you that only death can pay for life  you knew the price  where is khal drogo  show him to me  show me what i bought  with my sons life  as you command lady  come  i will take you to him   time enough for that later  i want to see him now  the khalasar is gone  a khal who cannot ride is no khal  the dothraki follow only the strong  im sorry my princess  drogo  why is he out here alone  he seems to like the warmth princess  he lives  you asked for life you paid for life  this is not life when will he be as he was  when the sun rises in the west sets in the east  when the seas go dry  when the mountains blow in the wind like leaves  leave us  i dont want you alone with this sorceress  i have nothing more to fear from this woman  go  you knew what i was buying and you knew the price  it was wrong of them to burn my temple   it angered the great shepherd  this is not gods work   my child was innocent  innocent  he would have been the stallion who mounts the world  now he will burn no cities  now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust  i spoke for you  i saved you  saved me  three of those riders had already  raped me before you saved me girl  i saw my gods house burn  there where i had healed men and women beyond counting  in the streets i saw piles of heads  the head of the baker who makes my bread  the head of a young boy  that i had cured of fever just three moons past  so tell me again exactly what it was  that you saved  your life  hmph  why dont you take a look at your khal  then you will see exactly what life is worth  when all the rest has gone  you cant  get out of my way sam  theyll put out the word  theyll send out ravens people will come after you  do you know what happens to deserters  better than you do  what are you going to do  im gonna find my brother  and put a sword through king joffreys throat  you cant leave us now we need you here   move  i wont let you go   move  no  hyah  hand of the king  so it would seem  and your father said you couldnt take anyone with you to kings landing  no he said i couldnt take you with me to kings landing  he was very specific on that point  he knew my name  what  he said dont bring shae with you to kings landing  i believe he used the word whore  are you ashamed of me  are you afraid that im dancing around the court with my tits out  im funny now  im shae the funny whore  my fathers probably the most powerful man in the country  certainly the richest  he has all seven kingdoms in his pockets  everyone everywhere  always has to do exactly what my father says  hes always been a cunt  i believe the ladies of the court  could learn a great deal from a girl like you  why dont you come with me  be the hands lady  because the king needs a hand and the hand  i know what a hand needs   ghost  hyah   hyah  hyah  hyah  samwell   is he dead  no hes not dead  did we get him  come on help me get him up  lucky youve got plenty of padding  were taking you back to where you belong   i belong with my brother  but were your brothers now  theyll kill you if they find out youve gone  theyll kill you if they know you came after me   go back  sam told us everything   were sorry about your father  but it doesnt matter  you took the oath you cant leave   i have to  you cant   you said the words  i dont care about  hear my words and bear witness to my vow  to hell with all of you  night gathers and now my watch begins  it shall not end until my death  i shall live and die at my post  i am the sword in the darkness  the watcher on the walls  the shield that guards the realms of men  i pledge my life and honor to the nights watch  for this night and all nights to come  when the sun  rises in the west  and sets in the east  then you shall return to me my sun and stars  kings  oh i can tell you all there is to know about kings  the thing you need to understand about kings is  for the past 67 years ive known  truly known more kings than any man alive  theyre complicated men but i know how to serve them  yes  and keep on serving them  aerys targaryen  of all the thousand thousand maladies the gods visit on us  madness is the worst  he was a good man  such a charmer  to watch him melt away before my eyes  consumed by dreams  of fire and blood  robert baratheon  was an entirely different animal powerful man  a great warrior  but alas winning a kingdom  and ruling a kingdom are rather different things  they say that  if a man goes through life with his battle visor down  he can often be blind  to the enemies at his side  now i serve his son  king joffrey  may the gods bless his reign  he is a capable young man strong military mind  stern  but sternness in defense of the realm is no vice  its far too soon to know what manner of king he will be  but i sense  true greatness on the horizon for our new king  true greatness  so whats the thing  what thing  about kings  you said the thing you need to understand about kings  what things what  when you started you never mind  let me see you out my dear   its all right no need  yes yes  till the next time  right  when you imagine yourself up there how do you look  does the crown fit do all the lords and ladies  simper and bow the ones who sneered at you for years  its hard for them to simper and bow without heads  a man with great ambition and no morals  i wouldnt bet against you  and what would you do my friend  if you found yourself sitting up there  i must be one of the few men in this city  who doesnt want to be king  you must be one of the few men in the city  who isnt a man  oh you can do better than that  when they castrated you did they take the pillar with the stones   ive always wondered  have you  do you spend a lot of time wondering whats between my legs  i picture a gash  like a womans is that about right  i am flattered of course to be pictured at all  must be strange for you even after all these years  a man from another land  despised by most  feared by all  am i that is good to know  do you lie awake at night fearing my gash  but you carry on whispering in one kings ear  and then the next  i admire you  and i admire you lord baelish  a grasper from a minor house with a major talent  for befriending powerful men  and women  a useful talent im sure youd agree  so here we stand  in mutual admiration and respect  playing our roles  serving a new king  long may he reign   my king  my king  my lords shall we begin  youre arry now hear me  arry the orphan boy  no one asks an orphan too many questions  cause nobody gives three shits  whats your name   arry  ah  we have a long way to travel and in bad company  i have 20 this time  men and boys all bound for the wall  your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons  and i didnt find no little lordlings down there  this lot half of them would turn you over to the king  quick as spit for a pardon  and the other half would do the same  except theyd rape you first  so keep to yourself and when you piss  do it in the woods alone  you stay with this lot boy  and stay  or ill lock you in the back of the wagon with these three  watch yourself midget  hes got a sword this one  whats a gutter rat like you doing with a sword   maybe hes a little squire  he aint no squire look at him  he looks like a girl  i bet he stole that sword  lets have a look  i could use me a sword like that   take it off him  give it here midget  look at him  youd better give hot pie the sword  ive seen him kick a boy to death  i knocked him down and i kicked him in the balls  and i kept kicking him until he was dead  i kicked him all to pieces   you better give me that sword  you want it  ill give it to you  i already killed one fat boy  i bet you never killed anyone  i bet youre a liar but im not  im good at killing fat boys  i like killing fat boys  oh you like picking on the little ones do you  you know ive been hammering an anvil these past 10 years  when i hit that steel it sings  are you gonna sing when i hit you  this is castleforged steel  whered you steal it   it was a gift  it dont matter now  where were going they dont care what youve done  theyve got rapers pickpockets highwaymen  murderers   which are you  armorers apprentice  but my master got sick of me  so here i am  come on you sorry sons of whores  its a thousand leagues from here to the wall  and winter is coming  ham  how many days in a row must a man be  expected to start his day with ham  bring me some beer at least  you look exhausted  was your moonlight ride that tiring  dont look so terrified  if we beheaded everyone that ran away for the night  only ghosts would guard the wall  at least you werent whoring in moles town  honor made you leave  honor brought you back  my friends brought me back  i didnt say it was your honor  they killed my father  and youre going to bring him back to life are you  no good  weve had enough of that sort of thing  beyond the wall the rangers are  reporting whole villages abandoned  at night they see fires blazing in the mountains  from dusk until dawn  a captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold  to what ends the gods only know  outside eastwatch  cotter pykes men discovered four blueeyed corpses  unlike us they were wise enough to burn them  do you think your brothers war  is more important than ours   no  when dead men and worse  come hunting for us in the night do you think it matters  who sits on the iron throne   no  good  because i want you and your wolf with us  when we ride out beyond the wall tomorrow  beyond the wall  ill not sit meekly by  and wait for the snows  i mean to find out whats happening  the nights watch will ride in force  against the wildlings the white walkers  and whatever else is out there  and we will find benjen stark  alive or dead  i will command them myself  so ill only ask you once lord snow  move out  are you a brother of the nights watch  or a bastard boy who wants to play at war  drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the night lands  sell them you can return to the free cities  and live as a wealthy woman for all your days  they were not given to me to sell  khaleesi my queen  i vow to serve you obey you  to die for you if need be  but let him go khaleesi  i know what you intend do not  i must  you dont understand  dont ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre  i wont watch you burn  is that what you fear  you will be my khalasar  i see the faces of slaves  i free you  take off your collars go if yo wish no one will stop you  but if you stay  it will be as brothers and sisters  as husbands and wives  ser jorah bind this woman to the pyre  you swore to obey me  i am daenerys stormborn  of house targaryen  of the blood of old valyria  i am the dragons daughter  and i swear to you  that those who would harm you will die screaming  you will not hear me scream  i will  but it is not your screams i want  only your life  blood of my blood
