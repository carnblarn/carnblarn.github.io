escaping the north with his head  send word to your son  any ironborn who surrender will be allowed  to return safely to their homes  with the exception of theon greyjoy  i expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer  mance is gonna march on the wall  when he does one brother inside his army  will be worth 1000 fighting against him   theyll never trust me  they might   if you do what needs to be done  what  i should have known better trusting a traitors bastard  hes not yours to kill crow  i dont want to marry the frey girl  i dont want you to marry her  if you enter

do us the great honor of joining our houses  is this what you want lady margaery  with all my heart your grace  i have come to love you from afar  tales of your courage and wisdom  have never been far from my ears  and those tales have taken root deep inside of me  well i too have heard tales of your beauty and grace  but the tales  do not do you justice my lady  it would be an honor to return your love  but i am promised to another  a king must keep his word  your grace in the judgment of your small council  it would be neither proper nor wise  for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for

wouldnt remember me if we had  i meet a lot of men  and i think you remember all of them  i think your true talents are wasted on them  youre very kind my lord  allow me to return the favor  youre afraid  why nothing dangerous down there  i know who you are  and unlike your current employer  i protect those who work for me  i dont abuse them to satisfy royal whims  or force them to abuse each other  how do you know about that  i thought you said you knew who i was  what can i do for you lord varys  littlefinger looks at you  and sees a collection of profitable holes  i see a potential partner   im afraid of him  oh you should be  hes a dangerous man  but everyone has their weaknesses  your current employer hides his very well  but not as well as he thinks  youre a virgin i take it  walk  childhood must have been awful for you  were you a foot taller than all the boys  they laughed at you called you names  some boys like a challenge  one or two must have tried to get inside big brienne   one or two tried  ah  but you fought them off  but maybe you wished one of them could overpower you  fling you down tear off your clothes  but none of them were strong enough   im strong enough  not interested  of course you are  youd love to know what it feels like to be a woman  ah they lay with lions  tavern girls id say  probably served my fathers soldiers  maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel  thats how they earned this  the glorious work of the northern freedom fighters  must make you proud to serve the starks  i dont serve the starks i serve lady catelyn  tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams   what are you doing  burying them  we shouldnt stay here we should get back on the river  i think these women would understand if  i dont care what you think  i didnt leave it here  untie me now  i gave it to you to cut the rope and now i dont  have me dagger no more  so unless it got stuck in your ass on its way to your cunt  it stands to reason that its gone whoa  whats your business here  traveling a prisoner  youre a woman a woman  well fuck me  if youve quite finished up  all right well be going  whoa whoa  who do you fight for  the starks  what did he do  apparently eating is now a crime who knew  no stealing is a crime  but its not a crime to starve thats justice for you   where are you taking him  to riverrun  why riverrun  steal from the tullys its their dungeons you rot in   why not kill him  for stealing a pig  i dont give the orders  he must be important to someone  sending him with you how important could he be  all right have it your way  mlady   do i know you  have you been to ashemark   no  then you dont know me  do you ever go to the river market at salt rock   is it near ashemark  no  ive never been there  what do you think of these beauties  i hope you gave them quick deaths  two of them we did yeah  wait  i do know you  thats jaime lannister  i wish someone had told me  i wouldnt have had to steal that pig  if this is the kingslayer i think id know about it  how do you know what the kingslayer looks like  i was at whispering wood i saw him  they dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the king  hes not the kingslayer sorry to disappoint you  if he was id only be traveling his head  i have a question for you both  and i want you to answer it at the same time  i count to three you both answer  whats his name  one  two three  two quick deaths  those were stark men  i dont serve the starks  i serve lady catelyn  i told her id take you to kings landing  and thats what im going to do  stay  walder frey is a dangerous man to cross  i know that  and you mean to do it anyway  i love her  i know that seems important to you  it is important to me  your father didnt love me when we married  he hardly knew me or i him  love didnt just happen to us  we built it slowly over the years  stone by stone  for you for your brothers and sisters  for all of us  its not as exciting as secret passion in the woods  but it is stronger  it lasts longer  and that is what would be in store for me  with one of walder freys daughters   what you and father had  why not  because shes not beautiful  because shes not exotic and exciting  now youre arguing just to argue because you arranged it  and you agreed to it  you gave him your word  treat your oaths recklessly and your people will do the same  if your father lived his life for one thing  my father is dead  and the only parent i have left has no right  to call anyone reckless  you said you saw my victory in the flames  i did   i still see it  the flames lied  and im no better than a savage  trusting in a fire god  i fought for your god in blackwater bay  i led my men to the gates of the seventh hell  as their brothers burned alive and for what  attacked from behind by tywin lannister and the tyrells  if you see so much in your flames why didnt you warn me  the lord of light only allows me glimpses  you claimed to speak for a god  will you quit the war just because youve lost a battle  you talk about war as if you understand it  ive been fighting far longer than you  have you show me how you fight  show me  wheres your god now  will he save you  where is your god  inside you  i murdered my brother  we murdered him  share the weight with me  he wasnt your brother  this war has just begun  it will last for years  thousands will die at your command  you will betray the men serving you  you will betray your family  you will betray everything you once held dear  and it will all be worth it  because you are the son of fire  you are the warrior of light  you will sweep aside this pretender and that one  you will be king  you promise these things but  you dont know  none of us know  let me show you  look into the fire my king  look  i see fire  keep looking  do you see  do you see my king  yes  i will kill that man  i dont care how many arrows they feather me with  how many spears they run through me  i will kill that hornblowing cunt before i fall  they want you to know youre surrounded  i know im surrounded  i know that because i stood on the battlements  and saw i was surrounded  they dont want you to sleep  they want to sap your spirit before  thank you wise bald man  thank you for explaining siege tactics to me  no word from my father  no  send more ravens  you killed all the ravens  the first time i saw winterfell  the first time i saw winterfell  it looked like something that had been here for  thousands of years  and would be here for thousands of years  after i was dead  i saw it and i thought  of course ned stark crushed our rebellion  and killed my brothers  we never stood a chance against a man who lives here  lord stark went out of his way to make it your home  yes my captors were so very kind to me  you love reminding me of that  everyone in this frozen pile of shit  has always loved reminding me of that  you know what its like to be told how lucky you are  to be someones prisoner  to be told how much you owe them  and then to go back home to your real father  i will kill that man  i swear it to the drowned god  the old gods the new gods  to every fucking god in every fucking heaven  i will kill that man  theon listen to me  i serve winterfell  now winterfell is yours  im bound by oath to serve you  and whats your counsel trusted friend  run  outside the walls  you have 20 men  you cant win  wait for nightfall and run  theres nowhere to run  id never make it back to the iron islands  and even if i did even if by some miracle  i slipped through the lines and made it home  id be a coward  the greyjoy who ran  the shame of the family  dont go home  join the nights watch  once a man has taken the black  hes beyond reach of the law  all his past crimes are forgiven  i wont make it to the wall  i wont make it 10 feet past the winterfell gates  there are ways  hidden passageways built so the lords of winterfell  could escape  the road will be dangerous  but with a little luck  the nights watch is an ancient honorable order  youll have opportunities there  the opportunity for jon snow to cut my throat in my sleep  the opportunity to make amends for what youve done  ive done a lot havent i  things i never imagined myself doing  ive known you many years theon greyjoy  youre not the man youre pretending to be  not yet  you may be right  but ive gone too far to pretend to be anything else  you hear that  thats the mating call of the northmen  they want to fuck us  well i havent had a good fuck in weeks  im ready for one  they say every ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland  aye   you think theyre right  aye  we die today brothers  we die bleeding from 100 wounds  with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts  but our war cries will echo through eternity  they will sing about the battle of winterfell  until the iron islands have slipped beneath the waves  every man woman and child will know who we were  and how long we stood  aggar and gelmarr  wex and urzen  stygg and black lorren  ironborn warriors will cry out our names  as they leap onto the shores of seagard and faircastle  aye   mothers will name their sons for us  aye  girls will think of us with their lovers inside them  aye  and whoever kills that fucking hornblower  will stand in bronze above the shores of pyke  aye   what is dead may never die

outside my door at all times  im afraid your friend has been relieved  of his command of the city watch  the gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father  or your sister  it varies from cloak to cloak   then my hill tribesmen  have gone home  your father paid them quite handsomely  im afraid we wont be seeing each other  for some time my lord  dont want to swim too close to a drowning man  and i thought we were friends  we are  podrick would you mind  there are many who know that without you  this city faced certain defeat  the king wont give you any honors  the histories
