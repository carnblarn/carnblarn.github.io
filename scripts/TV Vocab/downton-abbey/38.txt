                1  cora  hello rosamund  you made good time   i say  what  some man has opened a nudist colony at wickford in essex  called the moonella group  what do you mean a man has opened a colony in essex  not that sort of colony mama  its for people who want to take all their clothes off  in essex isnt it terribly damp   would that make a difference  well yes if you had no clothes on  well i think its a mad idea  oh i doubt they were aiming it at you  i wanted to come after mary told me about the farmers child  youre taking such an interest in  come to my room when youre changed   how long are you here for  about a week if im allowed  good were giving a bash for my deputy lieutenants on friday  you can stay and help  im afraid ill be away on thursday night  its another of my lord loot things  im guest of honour at a dinner for all the yorkshirebased commanding officers   youre staying the night  its in sheffield  and itll be very late so it seems sensible  youll just have to make do with cora  and edith and tom and rose  what news of your suitor  i havent heard from him lately  have you decided what answer youre going to give him yet  well i think i should tell him before i tell you wouldnt you agree  ellen terry has nothing on you when it comes to stringing out a moment   oh are you busy  no no no come in  how can i help  would you like me to leave  oh id love to think i had a secret that was too indelicate for a ladys ear but i havent  no ive got some good news for a change  an old aunts died  no thats not the good news but she made old bones   which is the main thing  well the point is  shes left me a bit of money   ah  its a few hundred quid more than ive ever saved  i am glad for you  well she was married to a baker and he did well but they had no children  how nice of her to choose you  well i think it was in memory of my dad more than anything  she and he were very close   and you want my advice on what to do with the inheritance is that it  it is  youd do better asking mr bransons advice or dr clarksons  shes asking mine  but we live so out of the way here  you need to talk to someone whos still in the game  ill give it some thought mrs patmore  and now if youll allow me i will go up and ring the gong  come and sit here and we can talk  im not going to eat you  but you are going to chew me up  why not just tell me about the dear little farmers daughter   what did mary say  no more than that  you knew id bring her back  i feared it  and i still feel very sorry for poor mrs schroder  i wrote to her she told me shes adopted another baby  then she has solved her problem  but the question remains have you solved yours  am i at least going to be allowed to see the girl   do you want to  of course  i gave up ten months of my life to make sure she came safely into the world  the trouble is the farmers wife mrs drewe  she just thinks im a nuisance  she doesnt want me to see marigold  so we have a situation of infinite danger to your reputation  which brings you no emotional reward to compensate   are we the first down  it looks like it want some  mmm  how is miss bunting still teaching daisy downstairs  she is but dont worry  i wont ask her to join us in the future  cora would overrule me in a moment if she thought it important to you  which you dont think it should be  i know you feel excluded at times an outsider in your own home  look i am very grateful to you and this family  but my vision of this country is different from yours  but not from miss buntings  i believe in reform and the moral direction of the left  and when im with her i dont feel like a freak or a fool  devoid of common sense  i would only say this tom  in your time here youve learned both sides of the argument  befriended people youd once have seen as enemies   thats true  you should be proud  five years ago would you have believed you could be friendly with my mother  chuckles im not sure id have believed it five minutes ago  dont make nothing of what youve achieved thats all  drinks before dinner wait till carson catches you   youll notice i poured them myself  chuckles  anna ive had a note from sergeant willis  he says hes going to look in this morning at 11 oclock   to see me  thats what he says   anyone else mr carson  im not sure  he says he wants to talk to anna and lady mary  lady mary why her  i dont know but could you warn her  ill tell her when i take up the breakfast tray  may i ask to what do i owe the pleasure of this visit  ill get straight down to it  you know how lord merton likes to  display his interest in all things medical  at least he likes to when in the company of mrs crawley  your confidence is a compliment  i confide in you dr clarkson because i must  only you can help   that is more flattering still  its the familys fault really  weve trained her in our ways and the earnest and intellectual bonne bourgeoise  has been replaced by a rather less definable figure  are you saying you liked her better when she was more middleclass   no i wouldnt go that far  but you understood her better  precisely now i do not know who she is  i do not know what it is she wants  well there are many who wouldnt be puzzled by the desire  to marry a lord and live in a palace  can i ask you a personal question  ive lived through great wars and my share of grief  i think i can manage an impertinent question from a doctor  do you perhaps resent the idea of a change of position for mrs crawley  im sorry i do not quite grasp your question  it bewilders me  but i will say this  do you wish to see her live a life  devoid of industry and moral worth   i do not  and when the glitter is tarnished  you know what then  a hollow existence in a large and draughty house  with a man who bores her to death   its a terrible prospect  so our duty is clear  footsteps  oh its you mlady  yes i wanted to bring my aunt to meet marigold  this is lady rosamund painswick may i introduce mrs drewe  how do you do mrs drewe were sorry for dropping in like this i expect youre very busy  i am busy mlady yes  this is marigold  oh i do see shes very sweet  lady edith seems to think so  hello  lady edith has decided to show off the baby to her aunt   lady rosamund painswick  pleased to meet you mlady  well we dont want to disturb your day  ive got to get the dinner started  yes of course  goodbye dear  remember your remember your friend rosamund   marigold starts crying  i should take her inside   oh i could always   ill take her  of course  goodbye  well  its exactly what i said would happen  she wants marigold as her toy  to be poked and prodded by every stray guest from the big house  and youve done this youve done it  what did you mean by saying to mrs patmore  we were living our lives out of the way not in the game  well we are  why does everyone talk as if we dont live in the modern world   you dont agree with that then  no  does the king not live in the world of today  does mr sargent not paint modern pictures  does mr kipling not write modern books   so what are you going to tell her  i dont know yet i shall consider  sergeant willis is asking for you mr carson  hes got a man with him from london he says  sighs   theyre in the library now  they  an inspectors come from scotland yard  what does he want with me  what does he want with any of us none of it makes any sense  by the way id like to catch the tenoclock train tomorrow  im dining with mr blake and i dont want to be in a rush  will we stay at lady rosamunds  she doesnt mind shes told mead   will you see lord gillingham  i dont think so  so you havent changed your mind  right lets get this over with  have i finished us off before we ever really got started  youve pitted yourself against them from the start  how can you retreat from that position  you mean ive made it them or me  havent you  you despise the family but i think you forget my wife was one of them  my child is one of them  where does that leave me  dont you despise them really  no i dont  id like things to change but i dont think in blackandwhite terms any more   while i do  look im not going to pretend  i havent enjoyed knowing you  in fact im relieved to know im not the only socialist left on this earth  but maybe we should call it a day before one of us gets hurt  i dont know what else to add mr vyner  i remember we had to race to catch the train  id had lunch with lord gillingham and i needed to get home  as the church fete was planned for the following day  and it was during the fete that lord gillingham arrived  with the news of mr greens death  thats right and i told anna  hmm  was it a great surprise  i think i would have called it a shock  she was very shocked  was she was she indeed   can i go now  i think lady mary has given what help she can  erm will you confirm that mrs bates was in london  on the morning that mr green died and that you dont know where  i only have to ask her  secondly you have no reason to believe  that bates was anywhere further south than york  no reason at all  i think theyd enjoy getting to know each other better  i think its a nice idea but shouldnt i do it for once  i always seem to be taking luncheon off you  no id rather  you see mrs potter likes to have people to cook for  and spratt needs something to occupy his mind  oh  we both have an inkling that my maid collins is on the way out   oh i do hope not  no i dont mean shes dying  i mean shes on her way out of my house  she keeps talking about her mother being infirm  but im infirm why doesnt she think about that  youre as infirm as windsor castle  and why does spratt mind particularly  because he likes things to be just so  but also i think collins was his creature  and does his bidding without qualm or query  he cant be sure of that in the next one  well never having had a ladys maid its not a challenge ive had to tussle with   but youll come on thursday  i will  i think it would be nice for doctor clarkson  to see beyond lord mertons position and get to know the man  i agree  oh i knew i had something to tell you  shrimpie thinks he may be on the trail of princess kuragin  oh i am pleased  yes hes heard a rumour of some russian nurses working in  wan wan chai   and thats in hong kong  well nearby i think  well it sounds much better than it might have been  yes the idea of princess irina scrubbing the sick  and emptying bedpans is a cheering one   will you tell her husband  no ill wait until shrimpie is certain  these things must be managed carefully  yes  sounds as if this must be managed very carefully  why did mr carson try to hide that you were in london on that day  i dont think he tried to hide anything he just forgot  isnt it a big thing when a member of the staff goes to london   not for a ladys maid  mrs hughes please  shes right its not a big thing for ladies maids or valets  im going tomorrow with lady mary  and you liked mr green  yes i did very much  he wasnt so fond of your husband  well theres no accounting for taste  chuckles dont go away mrs bates  youve said youll be in london ive no objection  but dont go away  im very sorry my lord i wonder if you know when we can get in here and lay the table  the police have taken over the library and i needed to spread these out   what are they for  im trying to formulate my plans for the village  and im looking into some builders  you wont use the ordinary maintenance team  it would be beyond them  have you made your choice  ill have to talk to lady mary but i like the look of this outfit  theyre based in thirsk so theyre local and their work is excellent  of course we should all invest in building  fortunes will be made over the next few years  thunder  why dont i hold the bags while you do that  oh thats frightfully nice of you are you sure  quite sure   erm i can have them back now  i shouldnt dream of it  where are you going  erm just to st mary magdalenes  you must have a very sweet tooth  laughs no theyre not for me  i give tea to some russian refugees every tuesday and thursday they love cake   i love cake  oh come and have some if you like   thunder  gasps  laughs  chuckles   are you interested in russia  not terribly  although i am very sorry for them all  of course  i should be more interested really   why  i have a bit of russian blood   how extraordinary  its true  in a way my family is russian or at least they used to be  well now i insist come and have some tea  by way of a thankyou  i suppose we ought to introduce ourselves even if it feels funny  erm rose macclare  atticus aldridge at your service  that doesnt sound very russian  well we werent called aldridge back then  chuckles  squeals  mrs patmore i think i may have a solution to your problem  oh thats good to hear  why not invest in the building trade  with the expansion thats going on everywhere youd soon see a good return  oh well thats a thought  had you any special firm in mind  what about wp moss  theyre based in thirsk theyre expanding and i hear their name everywhere  i expect you keep your ear to the ground about that sort of thing  i like to keep abreast of whats going on in the world  so can you buy shares in wp moss i mean have they gone public  well erm youll have to make enquiries  miss bunting i must confess i am surprised to see you here  rest easy mr carson ive come to say goodbye  shes leaving the school isnt she  shes leaving the school and the village because mr branson wont stand up to his lordship  you are nudging impertinence daisy  i should think carefully before you say one more word  are you going honestly  i am but the situations not quite as daisy recounted it  we already knew that  ive had an offer from a school in preston in lancashire  a grammar school no less so its quite a step up  i dithered a bit but ive decided to accept  because she gets insulted when she comes here  i am sure miss bunting is given the reception she deserves  mrs patmore  dont let daisy give up her studies shes got potential   whats going on here  all sorts  mr carsons giving me investment advice and miss buntings leaving downton  because mr branson wont stick up for her  well that seems to cover it  ill be in my room  well goodbye and good luck  goodbye  ah mrs hughes who is this mr vyner  hes the london detective looking into the death of mr green  why do they keep questioning mr and mrs bates  who says they do  this house has no secrets  then i suggest you ask mr vyner  i may just do that  who knows i might have something to tell him  dont make trouble mr barrow  are you saying i shouldnt do my duty mrs hughes  no im asking you not to make trouble  are you quite well you look as if you could do with a lie down  dont worry about me   who was that on the telephone  simon bricker  oh god what did he want  i shall answer without commenting on your tone  he wants the picture photographed for his book   when is this  he comes tomorrow and they take the pictures on friday  well you know i wont be here ive got the dinner in sheffield  since you dont like him i dont see that as a drawback   and marys in london  what difference does that make  its not that i dislike him exactly  its that this business has been dragging on  robert its a compliment by referencing our painting in his book  hell increase its value maybe by a lot is that so bad  youre not forbidden from inviting him  good because i already have  mr branson sir  hello daisy what can i do for you  you can do something for yourself youre making the biggest mistake of your life   is this miss bunting by any chance  shes an extraordinary person  clever and kind   shes all of those things  then why turn your back on her   daisy   i mean it  shes leaving tomorrow but i know she loves you  i can tell when she speaks of you  shes leaving tomorrow for good  wont you stop her youre not a crawley  you belong with us  were the future theyre the past   well i can hear her voice in that  daisy  what are you doing here  she was checking something in the dining room i held her up  get back downstairs immediately  mr carson  have any of you heard of someone called atticus aldridge  he sounds like the hero of a novel by mrs humphrey ward   im not sure any more clues  i met him today in york  marsha george told me his fathers been made lord sinderby  now wait a minute i remember this  when the title was created the locals were furious but now i cant remember why  perhaps because sinderbys a yorkshire village and theyd only just bought a house   canningford grange  oh have the wheelers sold up  you knew that i told you what does my lord sinderby do  oh i think hes a banker  i dont know really but the sons nice  oh nothing like that  barrow are you quite well  carson have you been overworking him  not that im aware your ladyship  mr barrow am i illtreating you   you are the soul of kindness mr carson  thank you mr barrow  im looking forward to your party  its very daring of the lord lieutenant to give a cocktail party  carson what do you think  well i agree with carson it seems very fast to me   well i love cocktail parties  me too  you only have to stay 40 minutes instead of sitting for seven courses  between a deaf landowner and an even deafer major general  even so theyll say youre not doing things properly any more   do you care what people think  yes  i accept change but i want to navigate it gently  i dont want to leap into it and put everyones backs up  but why do the rituals the clothes and the customs matter so much  because without them we would be like the wild men of borneo  i disagree manners and tradition are all very well  but once they start to control us theyve outlived their usefulness  well there are more important things to worry about  than whether or not carson minds serving cocktails  why is carson in the line of fire whats he done wrong  im sorry excuse me mama ive rather a headache   what was that about  rosamund you spent the afternoon together  did edith say anything was bothering her  oh shes just very tired shell be fit as a flea tomorrow  thats nice of you ill just let mr carson know  oh could you leave it for a moment  hes given me his view about my money  he says i should put it into a building firm wp moss  or if not them then into some other building opportunity   and you dont want to  its not that exactly  but i dont know about building  and i dont like to put money into something i dont understand   then why did you ask him  because hes a man i suppose  im not sure thats a good enough reason  nor am i now  but i dont want to hurt his feelings  i wish men worried about our feelings a quarter as much as we worry about theirs  you seem very thoughtful  im on the brink of a decision  i just hope its the right one  well i wont ask what its about  but remember tom  make the right choice for you and not for us  you know youre much nicer than a lot of people realise  not always good night  good night  i dont know what you mean mama  you question my motives every time i come here  its as if i werent welcome  just tell me what were you and edith discussing in such a huddle  well it is very hard   rosamund you are addressing your mother not the committee of the womens institute  im afraid youve read somewhere that rudeness in old age is amusing  which is quite wrong you know  its about the child isnt it that is the secret you share  we both know you are not leaving my house until i learn the truth  so shall i have a bed made up for you here or are you going to tell me now  bleating  mr drewe i have to see her  it was a mistake to bring your aunt here  margie feels that you want the child to be your plaything  how can she say that  the fact is i was wrong  she wont have you here not any more  you must leave us alone  if you dont stop coming shell make me give up the farm and move away  but what about marigold  what do you mean wed take her  but you cant i wont allow it  what would you suggest  we bring her up to the abbey and leave her in the library  im very sorry mlady its not what i planned  but i see no way round it  people always think how healthy we must be living out in the country  but the waters not as good as it might be   you mean the iodine deficiency  i do  i suppose you must get a lot of goitres  er quite a lot yes  its sad so few people know that the treatment is just iodine  too many suffer when the solution is simple   youve studied this  ive just read a lot   i wish i had studied it  door opens  dully luncheon is served mlady  do cheer up spratt  spratt is downcast because it is as i feared  collins has handed in her notice   you dont like change spratt  i detest it madam  well we all hate change spratt  but we have to learn to live with it  i dont hate change i find it exciting  remember  those customs and ceremonies that people think are the soul of england  were almost all invented by the victorians  quite right  the truth is theyre well suited whether we like it or not  and i dont believe hes faking his interest in medicine  im afraid i agree with you  you must be off soon  im just going to put him in his uniform and then well go  you never told me what the inspector wanted yesterday  mainly because im not sure  he asked me if i liked mr green and why he didnt like you  and what did you say  i said i dont know because i dont  i promise you this  nothing bad is ever going to happen to you again   i hope thats true  well sit by the fire  with all our children around us  and ill make certain that you are safe  i wonder  we both want it so much but do you believe itll really happen  i do with all my heart  actually im not sure about having children all around us  how many are you planning on mr bates  chuckles   you nearly missed me  you never told me you were going   who did  daisy  my champion   the school must be sorry  maybe  i think i was rather a nuisance but i hope theyll miss me a bit  i hope youll miss me a bit  ill miss you a lot  ive loved you you know  i could have loved you more if youd let me  im glad we met  youve reminded me of who i am and im grateful  and i wont lose touch with that again  but i wish wed met before you ever knew them  we need to get started if youre to catch the four oclock miss  let me   did you have a nice journey  excellent  thank you very much  hello lord grantham you look very splendid  were ships that pass in the night mr bricker  i have to go to sheffield but ill see you tomorrow  if youre still here when i get back  goodbye cora  so here we are again  im beginning to find downton quite homelike  good youre very welcome  as long as you behave  what are you doing here  in search of more cake  i wanted to see you again before i went up to london to start my new job at the bank   do you think i should buy a bowler hat  laughs  let me introduce you prince kuragin count rostov this is mr aldridge  im mr kuragin here   have you heard from aunt violet yet  even if your father finds her  what happens next to any of us  we are strangers in a strange land  talk to mr aldridge  his family were russian  but theyve started a new life in england and so can you  where did they come from  odessa  his greatgrandfather came with some of them in 1859  see i do remember what im told   and then the rest of the family followed in   1871  how brilliant thats right   he is not russian  nikolai nye nado  no hes not russian now but   they were not russian then  im sorry about that  nikolai podozhdi  i dont understand  erm i think he said were not russian  because were were jewish  well how did he know  there were two big pogroms to drive out the jews from odessa one in 1859  and 1871  but its still odd  i mean youre english now but youre still jewish  whats the difference  would you let me give you dinner when youre in london  i might  well have to see  what a treat i havent been to simpsons for ages  well go straight to the table  ive asked a friend to join us and i want you to behave  why wouldnt i  goodness i wasnt expecting you   ditto  i happily was expecting you both  what is your scheme that we now hold hands and take a house by the sea together  not quite but i have an idea that may be  as the times advertisements say to your mutual advantage  youve got to stop this youre poisoning yourself  just lay off  look at you sweating like a beast  just because her ladyship let you stay you think you can boss us all around  forgot the cream  oh miss baxter you may not think i have the right to ask  but now that her ladyship knows the truth might you tell me  if you really want me to   mr molesley now  yes mr carson right away  i dont think i can be hearing this correctly   no  no  you seem to suggest i should take the discarded leavings of lady mary crawley  dust off the fluff and put them on my own plate   thats not what charles meant  isnt it  good what a relief now we wont have to quarrel  mabel youre in love with tony gillingham you know you are  all i know is that tony broke off our engagement which i had not deserved  because mary crooked her little finger at him   it was his choice not mine  so you say  but now youre bored you want someone else to play with  so to dry his tears and keep him occupied you toss him back to me   this isnt my idea  well it certainly isnt mine  you know youre cutting off your nose to spite your face   im going  well what shall we do with your food  eat it and i hope it chokes you  that was a big success  whats your next suggestion  no i dont think we need another plan this was just a scene we had to play  can you put the fricassee there well share it  now id like my beef pink but not raw  you didnt linger very long over your port  because wed both rather be with the ladies  edith dear theres something id like to show you in the library   whats that granny  oh its just a particular book  you might find interesting  how is your fiery friend miss bunting  i notice we dont see her here as much as we used to   do you wonder at it  well its good to be disagreed with  keeps you on your toes  then lord grantham must have been on points from the moment she walked through the door  i hope you havent broken with her  shes gone she left today  oh i am sorry  what about you rose what happened to the young man you met  hes gone too hes starting a new job in london  oh dear what a sad conversation  he was interesting  he wasnt just the same old chap ones supposed to dance with his family was unusual   in what way  they came here from odessa 60 years ago  they were driven out by the pogroms but theyve done well  well yes that is interesting  i didnt tell you because i knew youd think it was a mistake  i suppose it never occurred to you that i might be right  what do you expect me to do send her back  its too late we cant get the child back to switzerland  and theres no point in keeping her here   what do you mean  that woman mrs   drewe mrs drewe  well shes at the point of explosion  we must get the child away  but where would we go  not we my dear  there are schools that will take children from any age  well find one in france where shell be properly looked after  i dare say you can even visit as long as you never reveal who you are  itll be quite manageable   and you agree with this granny  well i know it sounds very harsh  but what else are we to do  were going up  mama the cars ready whenever you want it  oh thank you cora  good night  well settle the details later  but i promise you  this is for the best  well in my eyes that makes you innocent  it makes you a victim of the crime quite as much as mrs benton  why didnt you tell me this before  because i knew youd say it proved my innocence when it does no such thing  id rather not hide from the truth thank you  dont hide then but dont punish yourself for ever either  no but i have learned  and i wont ever be controlled again  i must go   mr barrow said you wanted me  oh come in and sit down   mrs patmores got something to say  whats that  oh just how grateful i am for your excellent advice   oh
