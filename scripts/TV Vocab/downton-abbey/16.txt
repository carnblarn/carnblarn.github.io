                1  is there any news of sybil  shes still not coming she insists they cant afford it  mr travis can we move forward  if i could just ask you to come down the aisle again  can we get the troops organised  that means me  it seems rather hard on poor old travis when hes doing all the work  but the archbishop gets the glory  papa was the one who wanted a prince of the church  id have settled for travis  is there really no way we can get sybil over it seems ridiculous  on the contrary its a relief  branson is still an object of fascination for the county  well ask him here when we can prepare the servants and manage it gently  hes making a problem where none exists  noone could care less whether bransons at the wedding or not  you must think country life more exciting than it is  if you imagine people dont care when an earls daughter runs off with the chauffeur  she has run off with the chauffeur and theyll have to get used to it  mr travis are we ready any moment your grace any moment  can we please  that treacle tart just hit the spot thank you mrs patmore  so mrs hughes and anna are getting the place ready to let  that is the plan  im surprised anna held on to that house  i thought theyd confiscated the profits of murder  mr bates had the wisdom to transfer it to her before the trial  i dont think id have allowed it  then we must be grateful you were not the presiding judge  i still think its funny given that hes a convicted murderer  may i remind you mr barrow that in this house mr bates is a wronged man  seeking justice if you have any problems with that definition  i suggest you eat in the yard  i suppose you agree with robert not for the first time you suppose wrongly  the family must never be a topic of conversation  im afraid sybils already made the crawleys a permanent topic  all the more reason  if we can show the county he can behave normally  they will soon lose interest in him  and i shall make sure he behaves normally  because i shall hold his hand on the radiator until he does  i dont know this young man aside from good morning and good night  but he strikes me as a very interesting addition to the family  oh here we go and why should he be normal as you call it  i say he should come here and fight his corner  i like a man of strong beliefs  i think ill send them the money  please dont roberts expressly forbidden it hed be furious  but it cant be as bad as  look ill come and see you tomorrow  no i insist  right goodbye  papa whats the matter  nothings the matter what should be the matter  how was london we got it all done  but i couldnt have managed without my helper have you eaten  we had a bite on the train  well sit down anyway have a cup of tea  ill start on the final list for the wedding tomorrow morning  ive got the last of the wine deliveries coming on tuesday  how will you manage without a footman i agree  but i havent time to find one now  ive had a letter from my sister asking after a job for her son and  miss obrien we are about to host a society wedding  i have no time for training young hobbledehoys  her ladyship is ringing  well i dont see why not  ill ask his lordship when there you are  so ill ask you now ask me what  carsons in need of a footman and obrien has a candidate  alfred alfred nugent my lord hes a good worker  i think it sounds perfect  robert whatever you say my dear i have to go up to london tomorrow  ill be catching the early train thats very sudden  do you want them to open the house no ill come straight back  what are you going for its nothing to bother you with  its all there every entry  where did you find the book behind the bureau  we moved it out to clean and there it was  vera must have dropped it or something  so what do you want me to do  make notes on all the names  close friend relation  workmate tradesman and so on  then ill copy those and ill send them with the book to mr murray  havent you anything better to do i have not  because id rather work to get you free than dine with the king at buckingham palace  so what news have you got  what news could i have in here  oh ive acquired a new cellmate  to be honest im not sure about him  well just remember what my mother used to say  never make an enemy by accident  now do you think you can get the notes done before my next visit  i dont see what can come of it  probably nothing  and my next idea will probably lead to nothing  and the next and the next  but one day something will occur to us  and well follow it up  and the case against you will crumble  do you never doubt  for just one minute  i wouldnt blame you no  i dont doubt that the sun will rise in the east either  youre too tall to be a footman  no footman should be over six foot one  that cant be can it since hes already been taken on  well what have you done i was a hotel waiter after i was discharged from the army  but theyve cut back i think that shows real initiative  i suppose he can speak for himself  why is he on trial  this isnt an interview is it not when hes already got the job  no it is not an interview miss obrien  but he is on trial and if he cannot match our standards  he will be found guilty i mean to try mr carson  as long as you do  right go upstairs and get settled in  your aunt will hopefully find you a livery that fits  just at the start so weve a place to sleep after the honeymoon  you cant object to that  no its nice of them  though i doubt ill get used to taking you to bed with your father watching  hes so relieved were getting married he wouldnt mind if you carried me up naked  careful i might try it  i dont want to move to london or anything  im not kicking against the traces  just testing their strengths  i want us to get to know each other  to learn about who we both are without everybody being there  well its quite a big house  its a lovely house  its your home and i want it to be my home too  just not quite yet  chancery lane yes sir  ive spoken to frobisher and curran  and since i am a trustee should the estate ever need one  we felt i ought to be the one to tell you  you make it sound very serious  im expressing myself badly if you think it is not serious  why did we invest so much  lord grantham it was you who insisted we should  if you remember we advised against it  but war would mean a huge expansion of railways everywhere  every forecast was certain  rail shares were bound to make a fortune  many did but your principal holding which was very large indeed  was in the canadian grand trunk line  it was the main railway in british north america for gods sake  it wasnt just me everyone said we couldnt lose  we knew hard times were coming for estates like downton  and this investment would make it safe for the rest of time  charles hays was the presiding genius  and since he died the management has not  the fact is the company is about to be declared bankrupt  and the line will be absorbed into the canadian national railways scheme  are you really telling me that all the money has gone  im afraid so the lions share of coras fortune  i wont give in murray  ive sacrificed too much to downton to give in now  i refuse to be the failure  the earl who dropped the torch and let the flame go out  i hate to state the obvious but if theres not enough money to run it  downton must go  unless you break it up and sell it off piecemeal  i couldnt do that i have a duty beyond saving my own skin  the estate must be a major employer and support the house  or theres no point to it to any of it  morning  lady edith  hello  what are you doing here im meeting a train but im too early oh  oh i mustnt hold you up im not doing anything  i thought id get away from wedding panic  dont you like weddings dont be silly of course i do  only ive talked of clothes and flowers and food and guests  until im blue in the face  yes weddings can be reminders of ones loneliness cant they  sorry i dont know why i said that  so hows it going  is your grandmother coming over from new york for it she is  and sybil is she here yet  as a matter of fact she wasnt coming but i think she is now  mary had a letter this morning  papa doesnt know yet he will be pleased  i do hope so  so youll live at the big house when youre back from honeymoon  not live stay  well stay there until we decide where to go  itll be on the estate i should think or in the village  not here no  but i shall expect you and mrs bird to look after mrs crawley  youll not be taking me with you sir  only i thought youd be needing a proper valet once youre married  ive always thought of you as a butler who helps out as a valet  not the other way round id be happy to be a valet sir  especially in the big house we wont be at the big house for long  to be honest molesley i want to live more simply after the wedding  and besides mother absolutely relies on you  well thats very nice to hear sir thank you  you must be exhausted my lord  you cant have spent more than two hours in london  it was sufficient the new footman arrived while you were gone  what  yes he got the cable this morning and came straight over  very eager  and very tall  but when did  never mind  did you know about the new footman  of course hes already here  why did noone tell me what do you mean  we talked about it last night in my room  well nobody else must be taken on absolutely noone  until things are settled  what things  hows the wedding going i suppose its costing the earth  mary was never going to marry on the cheap  oh no nothing must be done on the cheap  i feel quite nervous dont be  youve got the skill and youve got the willingness  but he hasnt got the experience hes right  pay no attention youve a nice manner youre not vain like thomas  theyll like that  whats the matter with you im fed up  they promised me promotion she said theyd get a new kitchen maid  and id be mrs patmores assistant  if they promised you should withdraw your services  what do you mean like go on strike  but dont say i put you up to it  but what was in the letter just that sybils coming after all  shell be here on wednesday for dinner  will she be coming alone dont make trouble mother  can i do it if you wish my lady of course  are you really that tall yes my lady  i thought you might have been walking on stilts  when does grandmama arrive  she gets into liverpool on the 15th  the day before the wedding  im so looking forward to seeing your mother again  when im with her im reminded of the virtues of the english  but isnt she american exactly  can i help myself  you want to as well my lord  to be honest i think youll find that we all do it as well  what do you think youre doing youre not in a hotel now  did you train in a hotel  i did maam  that will be useful wont it carson  are you all set for the wedding  of course he is carsons motto is be prepared  im afraid badenpowell has stolen it  but you have all the help you need  well i wouldnt fight the idea of a second footman my lady  i sometimes think its time we lived in a simpler way  i agree much cattle much care  always supposing we have the choice  oh dont say that its our job to provide employment  an aristocrat with no servants  is as much use to the county as a glass hammer  i knew this would happen typical whats typical  that id wind up looking after mr matthew thats all i need  he hasnt thought it through im sorry to say but he hasnt  are you worried for your job mr molesley  me oh heavens no  no no no im essential to mrs crawley she relies on me  thats what he said essential  oh yes were all essential until we get sacked  how was it alfred was confused  he thought hed been transported to the hotel metropole  cheer up youll get the hang of it  will i oh youre still here mr molesley  i know i only walked over for a cup of tea and a chat  but ive outstayed my welcome nonsense  why not have a bite with us  they wont be leaving for a half hour or more  no id better get back i wouldnt want them to get home  and me not be there to let them in no you wouldnt  not when youre essential  then why is he coming all the way here  why not say it on the telephone i have no idea  if mr swires lawyer wants to see you and its urgent  it means hes left you something i doubt it  i would have heard long before this  anyway i hope not why  matthew do come on  the chauffeurs freezing to death and so am i  are you looking forward to the wedding  what do you think  im looking forward to all sorts of things  dont make me blush matthew  dearest papa  tell me did you send the money  please say yes what money  hello tom  welcome to downton  i hope i am welcome your ladyship of course  alfred would you take the luggage for mr branson  theres tea in the library  thank you  hello mr carson  is that mr charkham i saw leaving yes  he said to make his apologies he was late for his train  what did he have to say for himself  i dont know where to start  basically it seems that reggie swire did not wish to divide his fortune  so when lavinia died he made a new will with a list of three heirs  of which i was the third  why didnt the first name succeed  he died before reggie  in the same epidemic that killed lavinia  but at first they thought that the second heir a mr clive pullbrook  would be easy to trace  how much money are we talking about  a lot  a huge amount i had no idea  you could never have told it from reggies way of life  lucky mr pullbrook  this is it  some time before reggies death  pullbrook travelled to the east  to india to some tea plantations he owned there  and hes never been heard of since  theyve made enquiries theyve sent an agent out to visit his property  theres no sign of him  im sorry i wont and thats flat  then youll have to do it mr carson  im not dressing a chauffeur  he is not a chauffeur now  anyway you dont have to dress him  just see hes got everything he needs  im not often as one with mr barrow but no  then alfred must do it alfred  he wouldnt know what to do beyond collecting dirty shoes  well hell have to learn  is it an irish tradition  what she means not changing  of course it isnt granny it might have been  you dont change on the first night of a voyage  no my lady i dont own a set of tails  or a dinner jacket either i wouldnt get any use out of them  well i hope you own a morning coat since youre here for a wedding  no im afraid i dont we live a different kind of life papa  obviously  could you lower it a bit please mr carson  you should buy a downton wardrobe and leave it here  then you wont have to pack when you come what a good idea  im afraid i cant turn into somebody else just to please you  mores the pity oh no why should you change to please us  what is the general feeling in ireland now  that were in sight of throwing off the english yoke do you approve of the new act  would you of your country being divided by a foreign power  well wont it bring home rule for southern ireland nearer  home rule on english terms presided over by an english king  is keeping the monarchy a problem  would it be a problem for you to be ruled by the german kaiser  carson are you all right  ive been very clumsy my lord i do apologise  is it true that irish gardens have more variety than ours  oh yes dont you remember lady dufferins ball at claneboye  the gardens there were heavenly  i thought them very down on him that is because you know nothing  and wasnt he down on them  insulting our country insulting the king  i thought it was a miracle his lordship held his temper  but it must be hard mr carson  to sit up there with people he used to drive around  it is hard mrs hughes  please sit down  is there something we can do sir  i just wanted to come down to say hello  i wouldnt want you to think id got too big for my boots thats nice  i hope you and lady sybil are well  we are thank you  and weve been following the story of mr bates  mary keeps us informed  still i mustnt interrupt your dinner  thank you for coming down  hes settled into his new life  mary keeps us informed  well he knows her now whats that got to do with it  his lordship would never call her mary when talking to me never  if he wants to play their game hed better learn their rules  tomorrow lets ask the servants to come up and dine with us  to make things easier  you must get him to stop calling granny my lady and mama  we need something that doesnt sound too stiff and grand  lady grantham of course  and he can call me lord grantham  that doesnt sound stiff or grand at all  one step at a time  so what did the lawyer want i presume he turned up  he did and its rather complicated  but you were right it was about reggies will  so hes left you something  never mind that now sit down and tell me about the relations  that are coming for the wedding i want to unscramble them in my head  go to bed when youre done ill go to bed when im ready  whats happened to you have you swapped places with your evil twin  id like to know where the new maid is thats what you promised  theyve got a footman wheres the maid  i know and im sorry but i spoke to mr carson tonight  and they wont be taking anyone new on  except a footman i dont know how mr carson managed it  because his lordships put his foot down  but youre called my assistant now and youve seven shillings extra every month  youve still kept me here with a dishonest representation  oh dear have you swallowed a dictionary  somehow none of it seems to matter when were in dublin  class and all that just seems to fade away  im mrs branson and we get on with our lives like millions of others  but here he feels so patronised  and he hates it but you dont regret it  no never  hes a wonderful wonderful man  i just wish you knew him  darling we will know him  well know him and value him i promise  anyway  id best go upstairs and make sure hes not too suicidal  good night  oh by the way i dont know if mamas told you  but the whole grey familys coming tomorrow night  including larry  crikey youd better warn tom  oh and sybil i wouldnt tell papa about being mrs branson  but who are the greys  and why does it matter that theyre coming  the father lord merton is marys godfather  but larry grey used to be keen on me when we were young  were you keen on him  no i dont think so  i can hardly remember to be honest  so what are you saying nothing particularly  but we could run into ripon and find some tails  we have the money  i wont spend more of that money  all right  please dont talk about ireland all the time  i just want to make things easier for you  for me or for you  dont disappoint me sybil  not now that were here  shall i order the car  i dont think i can refuse a lift with mother  and then make the poor man go out again  ill walk it might rain  then ill get wet  now come and kiss me  so if they cant find mr pillbox what will you do with the money  pullbrook and they will find him  but if they dont  then ill decide what to do  or we will  because i cant keep it no of course not  why have you so heavily invested in one enterprise wasnt it foolish  has some of my fortune been lost  some  all  almost all  oh my dear  how terrible for you  its not so good for you  dont worry about me im an american have gun will travel  thank god for you anyway  you know what  im glad we have a wedding to celebrate  lets make sure its a great day  if its to be our last lets make it a wonderful last  enjoy our lovely home and the lovely people we spend our life among  bit early for drowning your sorrows  i thought it might be better if i moved down to the pub  youre not serious i cant go through many more dinners like last night  you dont make it easy for them  do you really think you can recruit cousin robert for sinn fein  i dont know what gets into me  i can see them staring and i know they dont want me here  well dont include me or mary  she wasnt too keen on the idea of a chauffeur for a brotherinlaw  forget that shes a pragmatist  she could be a tough fighter too lets hope shes not tested  forget this and walk back were brothersinlaw with highminded wives  wed better stick together  its all there  friends  though there werent too many  tradesmen acquaintances  but i cant see what youll get out of them  i do not believe when vera decided to kill herself  she never mentioned it to another living soul  we know she left no note  i wish to god she had  but why are you sure it was suicide and not murder  well i know you didnt kill her  whats the alternative  a thief broke in cooked an arsenic pie and forced her to eat it  its not a very likely scenario  you can see why they convicted me  im going to write to everyone in the book  in case she said or please god wrote anything  that could suggest a desire to die  how long will that take  why are you going somewhere  i should have gone into cooking i could pick it up in a trice  why didnt you then its a hard ladder for a man  for every escoffier and monsieur careme theres a thousand dogsbodies  taking orders from a cross redfaced old woman  whos this youre discussing  hello mrs patmore i didnt see you standing there  obviously not  sarah thought id be better off as a butler and thats what im trying for  i think youre right id rather be giving the orders  to a cross and redfaced old woman yes we know  there is that what you meant  yes perfect  slightly new but not too different  well see if sir anthony notices  i know they all think hes too old for me but hes not  bates is older than you and youre as happy as lovebirds  our situation is hardly ideal  but yes were very happy together  which is all that matters  as i keep telling them  ive no time to talk his lordships not come up yet  well what is it  i was hoping you could help young alfred to find his way about  as a footman you mean as a valet  hes looking after mr branson now  though i daresay a chauffeur can dress himself  but you could tell him what he needs to know give him an advantage  why whats the rush  youve heard mr matthew has turned down mr molesley  blimey you dont want much do you  can you remember what i had to go through to be a valet  of course i watched it didnt i  but young alfred is to make the great leap in one bound  well im sorry miss obrien but im not convinced  if youll excuse me  its infuriating theres nothing he can do  i dont agree i think its feeble  he should will himself not to be ill and then collapse the next day  whom will you ask instead im not sure  ive known sybil all my life  you can imagine how curious i was when i found out youd be here tonight  never thought wed meet in person  as opposed to what in spirit  well you see to us in marrying you  it seemed like sybil had left downton abbey forever  if you know what i mean  i know exactly what you mean  did they lose your suitcase on the way over how maddening for you  no my suitcase arrived safely thank you  along with my manners  hes still dressed as the man from the prudential i see  yes its nice to have someone from the real world isnt it  hello mama can i tempt you to one of these new cocktails  i dont think so  they look too exciting for so early in the evening  dont you think so carson  better avoided my lady i think so  what a pleasure it is to see you out and about sir anthony  i want to say can i be of any help but you dont seem to need any  he doesnt need help at all do you he wont let me do anything  mustnt be a nuisance you know  are you coming to the wedding of course  well if you really want me  i do i really do  you look very nice have you done something jolly with your hair  i say what the devil  what is it  dinner is served your ladyship  hows it going awkward  mr bransons well away and lady sybil doesnt like it much  hes only had one cocktail  maybe he was drinking before he came down to calm his nerves  no i dont agree and i dont care who knows it  the black and tans are there to restore order are they  why dont they just murder the entire population  and then you wouldnt hear a squeak from them  is there any way to shut him up if i knew that he wouldnt be here at all  are you interested in irish politics lord merton  i was only just saying hes interested in irish repression  like all of you look of course this stuff matters to you  yes it does matter  this stuff it matters a very great deal  whats so funny nothing  im just enjoying this vivid display of irish character  please tom we dont need to wear everyone out  why whats the matter am i not being polite enough  what a minute this was down to you wasnt it  i dont know what you mean yes you do  you put something in his drink didnt you just before we came in  thats not true is it larry what a beastly thing to do  oh come on edith thats not like you you could always take a joke  a bullys defence  listen mr grey has given mr branson something to make him appear drunk  could it be drink no not drink some horrible pill  sybil take him upstairs il ne manque que ca  tom has been the victim of a cruel prank  which i know youll all be kind enough to forget  forgive perhaps forget never is this true larry  i dont know why youre getting so hot under the collar  hes only a grubby little chauffeur  be silent this instant sir  i apologise for my son mr branson unreservedly  i only hope youll recover before the wedding  i hope so too  since i want him to be my best man  bravo well said  do you really mean it honestly  ive told you if were mad enough to take on the crawley girls  we have to stick together  thank you matthew thank you so much  that was rather marvellous of you to expose larry grey like that  you saved the day i wouldnt say that matthew saved the day  no it was you  i do hope well see a bit more of you once the weddings over  well wouldnt you like that  i should like that very much  much more than i probably ought to  edith let sir anthony go  goodnight papa  well thats the last of them  where are the others theyve gone to bed  sos edith and so should we  golly what a night for the county to feed off  it was good of matthew to show solidarity  i suppose so  were going to need all the solidarity we can muster  when will you tell the girls  i think i should tell mary now not before the wedding surely  i must theyre disagreeing about where they should live  it would be wrong for me to keep it from them  they can discuss it on the honeymoon and decide more sensibly  should we say something to your mother when she gets here no  shell go into state mourning and cast a pall over the whole proceedings  thank god she missed tonights drama or wed never hear the end of it  dont worry shell bring enough drama of her own  hm  it wont work you know  if you dont admit your guilt they wont let you go  how can i admit what isnt true  why do you have to be so pious  youre a touchy fella arent you  dont push me craig  is that a warning  yes yes it is  im warning you  im not sure about the hat  is it supposed to look crooked  dont listen to her i love it youre not to change a thing  anna i think you look lovely my lady  stop wait who is it  your longsuffering papa i suppose he can come in  whats this for going away  how does it look expensive  twice the national debt im afraid  but i know you dont mind  can i have one moment alone to give mary my blessing  thats lovely shoo everyone  go on bless me  of course but theres something i feel i ought to tell you first  i wanted to wait until you got back but i dont believe i can  that sounds rather ominous  hello mr molesley i got a message to call on mrs crawley  very good sir if youd like to give me your hat and coat sir  are you going up to the house to welcome the queen of sheba  oh i think so  are you no  ill pay homage at dinner  ive always admired the way mrs levinson is never overawed  by the setup at downton was napoleon overawed by the bourbons  come in tom  may i call you tom of course  good afternoon my lady that is lady grantham  im glad to find you here because  i want to apologise for last night  oh theres no need we know it was not your fault  you werent the first drunk in that dining room i can assure you  only the first republican  well youve got me there  why was it you wanted to see me  we asked molesley to look out matthews old morning coat  hes confident he can make it fit  thats very kind ladies  but i dont approve of these costumes  i see them as the uniform of oppression  and i should be uncomfortable wearing them  have you quite finished  i have good  please take off your coat  molesley do help him  if youll just slip it off sir  shouldnt he put the waistcoat on first  whats going on theyre forcing me into a morning coat  he has no say in it no he doesnt and nor do you  well what do you think molesley  itll need lifting a little here my lady  ill move the buttons fine  i think the shoulders look odd  mm  come war and peace downton still stands  and the crawleys are still in it  cora mother how lovely to see you  as long as it is  robert arent you going to kiss me with the greatest enthusiasm  tell me where does this come from  i hired it in liverpool why  i thought it might be a gift from the us government  to help get britain back on its feet  carson and mrs hughes the world has moved on since last we met  and we have moved on with it madam  really  it seems so strange to think of the english embracing change  mrs hughes this is my maid  reed  sybil tell me all about the arrangements for the birth  we do these things so much better in the states  edith still noone special  oh well never mind you must take a tip from the modern american girl  mary dearest mary  now you tell me all of your wedding plans  and ill see what i can do to improve them  whats the matter with you mrs patmore knows  shall i tell you mrs levinsons requirements during her stay  no tell her er yes miss reed how can i help  to start with i will need goats milk in the mornings  goats milk fancy that  she drinks only boiled water  really in england that is  shouldnt daisy do this i ought to take the tea up  ill have it ready in a moment  no fats no crab and nothing from the marrow family  do explain again how exactly  you are related to all of us mr crawley  rather distantly im afraid  my greatgreatgrandfather was a younger son of a third earl  my im going to have to write that down so i can study it  look at our page in burkes youll find matthew there  good because i would so like to understand  why he gets to inherit my late husbands money  i know its funny isnt it  not everyone shares your sense of humour  surely it doesnt matter now that theyre getting married  in fact wed better turn him out or itll be bad luck for tomorrow  quite right  you must be the chauffeur ive heard so much about  i am maam toms a journalist now grandmama  oh well well ive heard of those journeys on my side of the water  its very pleasant to hear of them happening here  its all right mama you can leave us unchaperoned  after tomorrow all things are permitted  dont embarrass me  bye matthew  get a good nights sleep  how many moments of crawley history has this room seen  and many more to come  i hope so  in fact what happened in the search for mr pumpkin  swires heir have you heard anything  yes charkham sent a telegram ive got it here actually  convincing proof of pullbrooks death stop  investigating date  what does that mean  well if pullbrook died after reggie then his heirs get the money  if he died first then i do  but thats absurd what right have his heirs to inherit anything  darling what right have i frankly what difference does it make  i shant keep it if i get it  well actually you will  because something rather terrible has happened  you see apparently papa has lost a great deal of money  enough to ruin him  enough for us to lose downton  god im sorry  im so sorry yes but surely if mr pullbrook did die before swire  then were saved  darling i dont think you understand  reggie swire put me in his will because he believed  i was his daughters one true love  so you were yes but  but i broke lavinias heart and she died he never knew that  how could i possibly allow myself to profit from her death to  to dine in splendour  because i took away a womans will to live  so youre prepared to destroy us in payment for your destroying her  darling please you know i would do anything for this family  anything except help us  except save papa from living out his days in humiliation and grief  and what about us what about our children  god matthew how can you be so disappointing  mary please no dont you see what this means  dont you see what a difference this makes  it means that youre not on our side matthew  it means that deep down youre not on our side  how are you getting on with your new companion  i dont like him but so far ive kept it to myself  so who are the bridesmaids  you dont care about all that youre wrong  its the stuff of my dreams  the panic that a dinner wont be ready or a frock isnt ironed  or a gun wasnt cleaned  do you know where youre going for the honeymoon  i want to talk about that  theyll stay in london with lady rosamund for a couple of days  just to get used to each other  and then they go to the south of france  ill hire replacements in london and then ill come home instead  lady mary wont mind ill pay  why would you do that  well to be near you of course  dont you understand  while im in here you have to live my life as well as your own  go to france see some sites get us some memories  but i wouldnt be home for a month  wont we have something to talk about  go i insist  for my sake  i was so afraid i was going to be late  ah ha ha  violet  oh dear  im afraid the war has made old women of us both  oh i wouldnt say that but then i always keep out of the sun  how do you find downton on your return  much the same really  probably too much the same but i dont want to cast a pall  over all the happiness how could you ever do that  tell me what do you think of young lochinvar  who has so ably carried off our granddaughter and our money  do you approve of him not as much as you will  when you get to know him  has he gone home to change oh no we wont see him again tonight  the groom never sees the bride the night before the wedding  nothing ever alters for you people does it  revolutions erupt and monarchies crash to the ground  and the groom still cannot see the bride before the wedding  you americans never understand the importance of tradition  yes we do we just dont give it power over us  history and tradition took europe into a world war  maybe you should think about letting go of its hand  there you are  i see youve said hello to grandmama  she is like a homing pigeon  she finds our underbelly every time  dreadful woman  no it wasnt me someone sent sybil and tom  the price for the tickets to come over  does it matter who it was it meant we could be at the wedding  of course i wish it had been you papa but i dont mind  i thank them whoever they are  well im very glad youre here but it wasnt me either im sad to say  i love a mystery who could it be  my guess is cousin isobel she always likes to stick her oar in  im going to ask her  for heavens sake it was me  you but it wasnt your writing  no smithers did it  like all ladies maids she lives for intrigue  you wanted me to come here  i wanted sybil and her husband to be here for marys wedding yes  why keep that secret  silly wasnt it  im very touched ill admit it  how democratic  makes me think maybe i have been mistaken in you  i am a woman of many parts  after all branson is i mean tom  youre a member of the family now  youll find we crawleys stick together  not always mary what is it  nothing its just  oh mary  oh there you are thats all for this course  dont you think daisy  is daisy all right mrs patmore oh yes  shes been such a big help  now i think we should check the pudding daisy  dont you agree  its nerves everyone cries at some point before their wedding  but what was the quarrel about  im not sure i know she accused him of not being on our side  oh well i hope shes wrong  that could be rather serious  of course hes on our side its ridiculous ill go and see him  no ill go im his best man i should be the one to go  what i know what it is to marry into this family  im not comparing myself to mr crawley  but he is another kind of outsider well i hardly  well why not hes the one wholl lose his job  if the weddings cancelled  i see what youre doing you know whats that then  not responding to my protest  oh not responding to my protest  very elegant i must say  whove you been talking to  thomas well  oh just give me the cloth and ill dry  suppose he never gets the money its not about the money  its that he wont save papa when he could  but he has to be true to himself  thats the point he puts himself above the rest of us  dont you see  what i see is a good man my lady  and theyre not like buses  there wont be another one along in ten minutes time  it seems big but its not big  and if it happens  i get the money  i cant do what she wants  its strange for me to be arguing about inherited money and saving estates  when the old me would like to put a bomb under the lot of you  but but youre meant to be together  ive known that as long as ive been at the house  and at first this kept you apart and then that kept you apart  but please dont risk it a third time  because ill tell you this  you wont be happy with anyone else while lady mary walks the earth  call her mary please never mind what i call her  i know what ill call you if you let this chance slip through your fingers  i just need a word no go away  im undressed you cant come in  one word come to the door  please just give him this chance  i wont look at you itd be unlucky if you did  only if we were getting married  which we are  my darling i refuse to quarrel about something that hasnt happened  and probably never will  thats what anna says  then shes right  my darling im sure we will fight about money and about downton  about how to rear our children about any number of things  then shouldnt we accept it  matthew ive been thinking  and im not angry now truly im not  but if we can disagree over something as fundamental as this  then shouldnt we be brave and back away now  no  its not because youre afraid of calling it off because im not  no  its because of something tom said  that i would never be happy with anyone else as long as you walked the earth  which is true  and i think you feel the same about me  can i kiss you  because i need to  very much no its bad luck to look at me  what about if i close my eyes and you do too  all right  but you mustnt cheat  good night  right im off to collect matthew  you look very smart i hope so because im extremely uncomfortable  branson  that is tom  i want to thank you for what you did last night im grateful i mean it  theyre both strong characters  id say we have plenty of slamming doors and shouting matches to come  forgive me i was about to be indignant  but you have a perfect right to speak as you do  i hope you mean that too  i do  now hurry up  youd ask if there was anything you wanted me to tell you  i mean im sure you know more than you did  and relax there isnt anything i need to hear now  because when two people love each other you understand everything  its the most terrific fun  careful mama or youll shock anna  im a married woman now my lady i think we should go  what about anna how are you going to get to the church  theyre waiting for me in the wagonette  ill see you there  i know mine was a wild runaway marriage darling  and yours is the one everyone wanted  whats so thrilling is that this is every bit as romantic  thank you for always being so sweet  love and position in one handsome package who could ask for more  never mind edith  well very very good luck my beautiful daughter  now youve a great big porter cab all to yourselves think of that  so well expect you to behave as if you were quite grown up  you can do that cant you  got everything you need yes  hop in then  careful with your dress  settle down  all right  dont do anything i wouldnt do bye  byebye good luck  have you got everything you need we do  now be off with you and enjoy yourself  i wish we were going  wholl get the food ready for when they come back  still fetch your coat and well see her off  right see you in a minute  were just leaving now my lord as soon as weve got anna  here comes the bride  will i do carson  very nicely my lady  thank heavens you got everything settled you had me worried  its not quite settled im afraid he wont get off that easily  but youre happy  i am  and what about you  im so happy so very happy i feel my chest will explode  its so lovely that youre here come behind us  i cant im not family but you almost are  morning thank you  molesley im very grateful to you  for keeping mr branson up to the mark  we both are arent we we certainly are  thank you sir  this is a proud day mrs hughes  i dont know if im proud but im very glad youre happy mr carson  youre next darling youll see will i  so encouraging to see the future unfurl  as long as you remember it will bear no resemblance to the past  good luck  you came  to be honest i wasnt completely sure you would  im glad to hear it i should hate to be predictable  im sorry it still seems odd to be found in your bed  isnt it dangerous to let this strallan nonsense simmer on  ask him to end it  somehow the poor chap managed to burn a hole in my tails  this is what comes of making him run before he could walk  weve 20 lords and ladies in the drawing room  and weve got no dinner to give them  let me call you sweetheart  im in love with  his lordships in trouble he thinks he may have to sell sell downton
