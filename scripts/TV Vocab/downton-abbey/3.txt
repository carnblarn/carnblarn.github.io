                  there you are mr bates its in came this morning  they said it would which isnt quite the same thing  hello  i could have posted that for you  well i prefer to do it myself  ill wait outside  what are you doing  if you must know im trying to find some space on top of the cupboard  to make life easier   so whats in it then  what  the bleedin great packing case that weighs a ton thats what  can you just leave it  no i cant and youll tell me right now   anything interesting  not particularly  its from evelyn napier  you met him with the delderfields last november   at doncaster races  is that lord branksomes boy   it is  do you like him  i dont dislike him   and whats he writing about  nothing much  hes out with the york and ainsty next week  the meet is at downton he wants some tea when hes up here  wheres he staying with friends  he says hes found a pub that caters for hunting  well we can improve on that  he must come here he can send the horses up early if he wants  hell know why youre asking him  i cant think what you mean his mothers a friend of mine  shell be pleased at the idea  not very pleased shes dead  all the more reason then  you can write a note too and put it in with mine  should i tell him about your friendship with his late mother  im sure you of all people can compose a letter to a young man  without any help from me   how much did it cost  every penny id saved  or almost  andis this the mystery lover  ive been taking a correspondence course in typing and shorthand  thats what was in the envelopes  are you any good  yes  i am actually  her ladyship wants the fawn skirt lady mary never wears  her seamstress is going to fit it to lady sybil but i cant find it  ill come in a minute  theyre waiting now one minute  im just changing my cap and apron  have you told anyone  what did your parents say  well i cant tell them till ive got a job  dad will think im a fool to leave a good place  and mum will say im getting above myself but  but i dont believe that  nor do i  its not of my doing  its all marys own work but i think we should encourage it  branksomes a dull dog but i dont suppose that matters   did you know his wife had died  he only ever talks about racing  cora is right  mary wont take matthew crawley  so wed better get her settled  before the bloom is quite gone off the rose  is the family an old one  older than yours i imagine   old enough  and theres plenty of money  really  mama youve already looked him up in the stud books  and made enquiries about the fortune dont pretend otherwise  are you afraid someone will think youre american if you speak openly  i doubt itll come to that   shall i ring for tea  no not for me  im meeting cripps at five  ill see you at dinner  you dont seem very pleased  im pleased  its not brilliant but im pleased  so  i dont want robert to use a marriage  as an excuse to stop fighting for marys inheritance  it wont make any difference  i dont think he has the slightest intention of fighting as it is  the price of saving downton is to accept matthew crawley as his heir  what about you  i dont dislike matthew  in fact i rather admire him  is that sufficient reason to give him your money  of course not then theres nothing more to be said  are we going to have tea or not  hello  id offer you a lift if i could  it was you i was coming to see  then your timing is matchless ive just got off the train  the other day at dinner  cousin isobel was saying you wanted to see some of the local churches  shes right i do  i want to know more about the county generally if im to live here  well i thought i might show you a few of the nearer ones  we could take a picnic and make an outing of it   thats very kind  nonsense ill enjoy it  its too long since i played the tourist  well it would have to be a saturday  churches work on sunday and i work all the weekdays   then saturday it is  ill get lynch to sort out the governess cart  and ill pick you up at about 11  how does it work its easy  you just press the letters and they print on the paper  get back please  they were trying to hide it so i knew it was wrong  wheres gwen now  doing the dining room with anna theyll be finished soon  then ill wait  with all due respect mr carson gwen is under my jurisdiction  indeed she is mrs hughes  and i have no intention of usurping your authority  i merely want to get to the bottom of it  why shouldnt gwen have a typewriter   mind your own business  whats that doing here  gwen come in  why is that down here whos been in my room they had no right  see in the first place none of the rooms in this house belong to you  and in the second i am in charge of your welfare   and that gives me every right  this is you isnt it  all we want is to know what gwen wants with a typewriter  and why she feels the need to keep it secret  she wants to keep it private not secret   theres a difference  amen  ive done nothing to be ashamed of  ive bought a typewriter  and ive taken a postal course in shorthand  im not aware that either of these actions is illegal  will you tell us why preferably without any more cheek  because i want to leave service  i want to be a secretary  you want to leave service   whats wrong with being in service  nothings wrong with it  and theres nothing wrong with mending roads neither  but its not what i want to do  i should remind you that there are plenty of young girls  who would be glad of a position in this house  when i hand in my notice i shall be happy to think one of them will be taking my place  what makes you think well wait till then  are you hiring and sacking now miss obrien  i thought that lay with mr carson and mrs hughes  enough of this im going to ring the dressing gong  and well have no more talk of this tonight  can i have my machine back now  very well but i wish i was sure you know what youre doing  daisy whats happened to you  i said you could go for a drink of water  not a trip up the nile  which churches will you show him  i cant decide  kirby possibly or perhaps easingwold  you dont think youre being a bit obvious  coming from you thats rich  there was a letter from mr napier in the evening post   did he accept  not yet  perhaps he thought it was too obvious  apparently hes bringing a friend with him  an attache at the turkish embassy  a mr kemal pamuk  hes the son of one of the sultans ministers  and hes here for the albanian talks   whats that  to create an independent albania  dont you read the papers im too busy living a life  since turkeys signature is vital  mr napiers been given the job of keeping him happy  until the conference begins  hes eager to try an english hunt  i shall invite this mr pamuk to stay here as well  who knows a little hospitality in an english house  may make all the difference to the outcome  and mary you will ride out with him  oh mama must i  my boots are at the menders and i havent ridden for weeks  anna please see that lady mary is fully equipped to go hunting  yes your ladyship  yes  i saw this advertisement for a limp corrector  yes  what does it do exactly  it corrects limps   does it work  well as i make it and i advertise it  is it likely id say no  could i see one  here we are  you adjust this to the right height to minimise the limp  you tighten these gradually as tight as you can stand  as the leg straightens the foot lowers to the floor  cant say its gonna be easy and you cant slack  every day all day if you mean business  all right  how much  she asks if we can both dine on saturday  there are two young men staying  so you wont be so outnumbered for once  what men  a turkish diplomat called something i cant read  and lord branksomes charming son  whos to be flung at mary presumably  when it comes to cousin mary  shes quite capable of doing her own flinging i assure you  open the door can you  i couldnt find her britches anywhere  so i asked mr bates  he looked among his lordships riding clothes  there they were  i only hope to god ive got everything  hat ill do here  gloves and crop are in the hall  gwen  whatevers the matter  hey come on sit down  hey  whats up oh  im just being silly  you should get that brushed  he wont be up for another half an hour now what is it  i suppose ive just realised that its not going to happen   what isnt  well none of it  im not going to be a secretary  im not going to leave service  i doubt ill leave here before im 60  hey whats all this  you saw their faces  and theyre right  oh look at me  im the daughter of a farmhand  im lucky to be a maid  i was born with nothing and ill die with nothing  dont talk like that  you can change your life if you want to  sometimes you have to be hard on yourself  but you can change it completely i know  mr bates are you all right  take her upstairs  dry her off  come on gwen  mr bates whats the matter  nothing not a thing im fine   let me help you  im perfectly all right thank you mrs hughes  are you sure  youre as white as a sheet  its my wonderful complexion inherited from my irish mother  take it take it dont dawdle  his lordship william  sir  very good   can you see them milady  not yet  oh wait a minute heres mr napier  i was beginning to give up on you   were moving off  we were fools not to accept  your mothers invitation and send the horses down early  my groom only got here an hour or two ago  my mounts as jumpy as a deb at her first ball  what about mr pamuk  i gather if he takes a tumble youll be endangering world peace  dont worry about kemal he knows what hes doing on a horse   well where is he  fussing  hes rather a dandy  i can see him now a funny little foreigner with a wide cheeky grin  and hair reeking of pomade i wouldnt quite say that  here he is now  lady mary crawley i presume  you presume right  sorry to be so dishevelled  weve been on a train since dawn and we had to change in a shed  you dont look dishevelled to me   lynch you dont have to stay with me  but his lordship asked me to  its a waste of your day  help mr napiers man get their things back to the house   his lordship said  dont worry ill look after her  well make it our business to keep her from harm i promise  i hope the day is living up to your expectations  its exceeding them in every way   and wheres mr napier  hes gone over the bridge look  and what about you will you follow him  or will you come over the jump with me  i was never much one for going round by the road  stay by me and well take it together  i wish we could talk a little more about you  what was it like  growing up in manchester  does it say anything about the side aisles  the side aisles were added in the  bybishop richard de warren  yes you can see that in the treatment of the stone  its wonderful to think of all those men and women  worshipping together through the centuries isnt it  dreaming and hoping  much as we do i suppose  was the screen a cromwell casualty  i daresay  i wonder how marys getting on  all right i should think   why  oh i just wondered  will she stay with the hunt the whole day  you know mary  she likes to be in at the kill  where shall we go next   not home  not yet  weve time for one more at least before we lose the light  i underestimated your enthusiasm  come on  is that one mine  home is the hunter home from the hill  heavens you have been in the wars  papa this is mr pamuk   my father lord grantham  how do you do milord   did you have a good day  couldnt have been better  this is thomas sir hell be looking after you   you remember mr napier  of course how are you  so kind of you to have us lady grantham  and this is mr pamuk   how do you do  milady  well what would you like  just baths were worn out  your cases are upstairs sir   if youd like to follow me  yes  well i hope mary hasnt left you too exhausted mr napier  no  he doesnt look turkish at all  he doesnt look like any englishman ive ever met  worse luck i think hes beautiful  is there some crisis of which i am unaware  no mr carson  i cannot think of another reason why you should congregate here  no mr carson  have you seen our visitor quite a treat for the ladies  indeed milord   are they settled in all right  i believe so  mr napiers valet seems competent fellow  and thomas knows what hes doing  why doesnt the gorgeous turk have his own chap  apparently his man speaks no english  so mr pamuk decided to leave him in london  probabily was very wise i hope thomas doesnt mind  you know thomas milord he has to have a grumble  but he cheered up when he saw the gentleman   bates is anything wrong  nothing at all milord  is that strap too tight  shall i adjust it sir  now im relying on you to see that i go downstairs properly dressed  dont worry sir  ive got sharp eyes for anything out of order  then i put yourself entirely in your hands  you do right sir  i should love to visit turkey  yes its a a wonderful country  my man always does this can you  im very attracted to the turkish culture  then i hope your chance will come to sample it  i hope so too  you forget yourself  iim sorry sir i  that will teach you to believe what the english say about foreigners  i ought to report you   i think you must ha  i mistook nothing  but i will make you an offer  later tonight i may need some help with the  geography of the house   the geography  yes  im not sure yet but i may wish to pay someone a visit  if that is the case you will help me  and i will say nothing of your behaviour  i dont understand why would she want to be a secretary  she wants a different life  but why  i should far prefer to be a maid in a large and pleasant house  than work from dawn till dusk in a cramped and gloomy office   dont you agree carson  i do milady  why are we talking about this what does it matter  it matters that the people that live and work here are content  of course we should be helping gwen if thats what she wants  i agree surely we must all encourage those less fortunate  to improve their lot where they can  not if it isnt in their best interests  isnt the maid a better judge of that than we are  what do you say mr pamuk  should our housemaid be kept enslaved  or forced out into the world  why are you english so curious about other peoples lives  if she wishes to leave and the law permits it then let her go  perhaps the law should not permit it for the common good  so you hanker for the days of serfdom  i hankerfor a simpler world  is that a crime  i do dream of a simpler world  as long as we can keep our trains and our dentistry  i wish i shared your enthusiasm   our dentist is horrid  why go to him then  he treated all of us when we were children  you know how the english are about these things   success at the grand national  yes indeed second  well the next time you feel a twinge  you must come to istanbul  wouldnt the journey be painful  sometimes we must endure a little pain  in order to achieve satisfaction  lady mary rode very well today  why did you send lynch back  i had my champions to left and right it was enough  did you enjoy the hunt today mr napier  mary said you had a tremendous run  it was like something out of a trollope novel  and what about you mr pamuk was your day successful  oh yes lady grantham i can hardly remember a better one  mary has more suitors tonight than the princess aurora  but will she judge them sensibly  noones sensible at her age nor should they be thats our role  well if youll excuse me thank you  is it fun to be back in the saddle  yes although ill pay for it tomorrow  would you ever come out with me  or arent we friends enough for that  oh i think it might be  that run reminded me of a day last month up in cheshire   we came down the side of a hill  excuse me  it seems we must brush up on our powers of fascination   i was a fool to bring him here  dont you like him  well i like him very much but so does everyone else unfortunately  excuse me  i hope i didnt wear you out today  not at all i enjoyed it  we must do it again  next time lets take my mother  she was so jealous she made me promise she could come with us  of course how nice that would be  what is it  is this picture really a della francesca  i think so the second earl brought back several paintings from  mr pamuk  let me come to you tonight please  i cant think what i have said that has led you to believe  i dont know when well meet again  so let it be tonight  mr pamuk i will not repeat your words to my father  since i should hate to see you cast out into the darkness   but can we agree to consider them unsaid  now if youll excuse me i shall rejoin my mother and sisters  you must be mad  i am i am in the grip of madness  please leave at once or ill  or youll what  ill scream  no you wont  well ill ring the bell then  and whos on duty now the hall boy  will you let him really find a man in your bedroom what a story  do you have any idea what youre asking  id be ruined if they even knew wed had this conversation   let alone if  what  dont worry youll still be a virgin for your husband  heavens is this a proposal  alas no i dont think our union would please your family  im afraid not  nor mine  but  a little imagination  you wouldnt be the first  you and my parents have something in common  you believe im much more of a rebel than i am  now please go  im not what you think i am  if its my mistake if ive led you on im sorry but   im not  you are just what i think you are  no  ive never done anything  of course not  one look at you would tell me that  oh my darling  wont it hurt  is it safe  trust me  hes dead i think hes dead  no im sure hes dead  but how  we were together and  hes dead  in your room  weve got to get him back to his own bed but how  its in the bachelors corridor miles from my room  could we manage it between us  he weighs a ton i could hardly shift him at all  well need at least one other what about bates  he couldnt lift him  william cant keep a secret  and thomas wouldnt try to  weve got to do something  who else has as much to lose as you if it ever gets out  not papa please dont say papa   i couldnt bear the way hed look at me  no not his lordship   what happened   i dont know  a heart attack i suppose or a stroke or  he was alive and suddenly he cried out and then he was dead  but why was he here at all  did he force himself on you  wellwe can talk about that later  nowwe must decide what to do for the best  theres only one thing we can do  i couldnt its not possible  if you dont we will figure in a scandal of such magnitude  it will never be forgotten until long after were both dead  ill be ruined mama ruined and notorious  a laughing stock a social pariah  is that what you want for your eldest daughter  is it what you want for the family  we must cover him up  hurry the servants will be up soon  weve got time   mama  sorry  i cant make his eyes stay shut  leave that and come away  he was so beautiful  her ladyships right  we must get back to our rooms  i feel that i can never forgive what you have put me through this night  i hope in time i will come to be more merciful  but i doubt it  you wont tell papa  since it would probably kill him and certainly ruin his life i will not  but i keep the secret for his sake not for yours  yes mama  anna  i will not insult you  by asking that you also conceal lady marys shame  let us go  i imagine youve heard whats happened  yes  a terrible thing  awful  ghastly for your parents  i dont suppose i shall ever make it up to them  well it wasnt your fault  i brought him here  if it isnt my fault whose is it  i was wondering if you might show me the gardens before i go  we could get some fresh air  i wont if youll forgive me  i ought to stay and help mama  of course  im so sorry about all this  i told your father ill deal with the embassy  they wont be any more annoyance for you  thank you  actually he was a terribly nice fellow  i wish you could have known him better  i took him on as a duty  but i liked him more and more the longer i knew him  perhaps you saw his qualities for yourself  which obviously you did  i had an uncle who went like that  finished his cocoa closed his book and fell back dead on the pillow  i dont think mr pamuk bothered with cocoa much or books  he had other interests  i meant you can go just like that with no reason  thats why you should treat every day as if it were your last  well we couldnt criticise mr pamuk where thats concerned   what do you mean  nothing  careful with that   gwen are you busy  your ladyship  i saw this it came out yesterday look  its for a secretary at a new firm in thirsk   see  what i dont understand  how did you know that you wanted to leave carson told my father   and you dont mind  why should i  i think its terrific that people make their own lives  especially women  write to them today and name me as your reference  i can give it without ever specifying  precisely what your work here has been  milady  thank you  lady grantham  ive come to say goodbye  theyre bringing the car round to take me to the station  have you said goodbye to mary  i have  will we be seeing you here again  nothing would give me more pleasure but im a little busy at the moment  i wonder if i might risk embarrassing you  i should like to make myself clear  the truth is lady grantham i am not a vain man  i do not consider myself a very interesting person  but i feel its important that my future wife should think me so  a woman who finds me boring could never love me  and i believe marriage should be based on love  at least at the start  thank you for your faith in me mr napier  your instincts do you credit  good luck to you   did mr napier get off all right  he did milord  and poor mr pamuk has been taken care of  we got grassbys from thirsk in the end  theyre very good and they didnt mind coming out on a sunday  is everyone all right downstairs  well you know  he was a handsome stranger from foreign parts one minute  the next he was as dead as a doornail  its bound to be a shock  of course upstairs or down  its been horrid for the ladies and for the female staff i expect  its particularly hard on the younger maids  indeed  dont let the footmen be too coarse in front of them  thomas likes to show off  but we must have a care for feminine sensibilities   they are finer and more fragile than our own  mr bates  i am going to have to insist that you tell me what is the matter  i thought it was for mr carson to give me orders  mr carsons no better than any other man when it comes to illness  now tell me what it is and ill see what i can do  its nothing truly  ive twisted my bad leg and walked on it too soon  itll be fine in a day or two  well if it isnt im sending for the doctor  the dowager countess  oh my dears  is it really true  i cant believe it  last night he looked so well  of course it would happen to a foreigner its typical  dont be ridiculous  im not being ridiculous  no englishman would dream of dying in someone elses house  especially someone they didnt even know  oh granny even the english arent in control of everything  i hope were in control of something if only ourselves  but were not dont you see that  were not in control of anything at all  edith go and tell mary to come back at once  and apologise to her grandmother  no leave her alone  shes had a shock we all have  just let her rest  just the ticket  nanny always said sweet tea was the thing for frayed nerves  though why it has to be sweet i couldnt tell you  what did you mean  mr pamuk lived each day as if it were his last  what i said  well how did you know  cant keep william waiting gangway  ill be asking the same question later  so youd better have an answer ready  daisy where have you hidden the flour i cant see it anywhere  its just there mrs patmore  well fetch it to me then youre all in a daze today  do you think we should have gone up there  to see how they are  i sent a note but i thought id be in the way why  i thought mary was rather struck with him last night didnt you  well it must have been frightful for all of them  but there it is  in the midst of life we are in death  i suppose mr napier will have to manage everything  i suppose he will  we all thought him a very nice gentleman  yes he is nice  will we be seeing a lot of him  i dont expect so no  because we rather hoped lady mary might have taken a shine to him  seems not  oh well  there are plenty more fish in the sea than ever came out of it  are you looking for something lady mary  i just wanted to make sure the room had been tidied up  after the after the people had left  life can be terribly unfair cant it  it certainly can  everything seems so golden one minute  then turns to ashes the next  can i ask you a question carson  have you ever felt your life was somehow  slipping away   and there was nothing you could do to stop it  i think everyone feels that at one time or another  the odd thing is i feel   for the first time really  i understand what it is to be happy  its just i know that i wont be  dont say that milady  dont raise the white flag quite yet  you can still be mistress of downton  old lady grantham hasnt given up the fight not by a long chalk  oh that  i wasnt even thinking about that  and if i may say so milady youre still very young  am i  i dont feel it  were all behind you milady  the staff were all on your side  thank you carson  youve always been so kind to me  always  from when i was quite a little girl  why is that  even a butler has his favourites milady  does he  im glad  lady mary  oh milady i thought  carson and i were just making sure  that everything was shipshape and bristol fashion  and it is  good night carson  good night milady  of all the men on earth i mean he looked so fit  dr clarkson said it was a heart attack   did you see any signs  i didnt have much chance to study the gentleman  you dont suppose theres anything sinister in it do you  every day the papers warn us of german spies  and they did say his presence was essential for peace in albania  i doubt it milord  anyone wanting to poison his food would have to get past mrs patmore  blimey thats a thought  unless of course shes a spy herself  i wish youd tell me whats wrong bates  youll be in no trouble i only want to help  i know that your lordship and i am grateful  but there is nothing i need help with   good morning mrs hughes  good morning milord  i wonder if you  now will you kindly explain what in heavens name is going on  im perfectly well mrs hughes a bit stiff thats all  just so long as you know im not leaving until you tell me  i hope you have a strong stomach  oh my god  cousin mary  hello   are we expecting you  no but i wanted to see you  i looked for you yesterday at church  i wasnt feeling up to it  none of us were  it must have been a horrible shock  yes   and he seemed a nice fellow  he was  a very nice fellow  so if theres anything i can do   please ask  there isnt but thank you  well here goes  do you not think we ought to say a few words  what good riddance  that and your promise  very well  i promise i will never again try to cure myself  i will spend my life happily as the butt of others jokes  and i will never mind them  we all carry scars mr bates inside or out  youre no different to the rest of us remember that  i will try to  that i do promise  good riddance  so he definitely went in  i saw him walk through the door  but you dont know if he went back to his own room  yes i do cos i was the one who found him there the next day  what i mean is you dont know if he went back under his own steam  i suppose not but how else would he have done it  thats what they call the big question  i dont wanna get in any trouble over this  dont worry you wont  your secrets safe wi me  you could stay if you married matthew  im a lost soul to you  what chance did he have against a champion  youre hiding behind him but hes not what you think he is  dont quarrel with matthew   why shouldnt i  one day you may need him
