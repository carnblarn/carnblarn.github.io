stay long  what about you mr bates  i dont see why not  theres lady mary  you go on ahead ill see you back at the house  right you are then  good day milady  is her ladyship all right  has she recovered from  if you think shell ever recover from carrying the body of mr pamuk  from one side of the house to the other  then you dont know her at all  well i didnt mean recover exactly just  get past it  she wont do that either  when she dies theyll cut her open and  find it engraved on her heart  what about you  what about your heart  havent you heard  i dont have a heart  everyone knows that  not me milady  you wanted to see the new chauffeur milord  yes indeed please send him in  come in come in good to see you again   branson isnt it  thats right your lordship  i hope theyve shown you everything  and delivered whatever we promised at interview  certainly milord  wont you miss ireland  ireland yes but not the job  the mistress was a nice lady  but she only had one car  and she wouldnt let me drive it over 20 miles an hour  so it was a bit  well boring so to speak  youve got a wonderful library  youre very welcome to borrow books if you wish  really milord  theres a ledger that i make everyone use  even my daughters  carson and mrs hughes sometimes take a novel or two  what are your interests  history and politics mainly  heavens  carson branson is going to borrow some books   he has my permission  very good milord  is that all milord  it is  off you go and good luck  he seems a bright spark after poor old taylor  and to think taylors gone off to run a tea shop  i cannot feel it will make for a very restful retirement can you  i would rather be put to death milord  quite so thank you carson  how about some house parties  shes been asked to one next month by lady anne mcnair  thats a terrible idea she doesnt know anyone under 100  i might send her to visit my aunt  she could get to know new york  oh i dont think things are quite that desperate  poor mary shes been terribly down in the mouth lately  she was very upset by the death of poor mr pamuk  why she didnt know him  one cant go to pieces at the death of every foreigner  wed all be in a state of collapse  whenever we opened a newspaper  oh no of course marys main difficulty  is that her situation is unresolved  i mean is she an heiress or isnt she  the entails unbreakable mary cannot inherit  no what we need is a lawyer  whos decent and honourbound to look into it  i i think perhaps i know just the man   are you going to the fair  i shouldnt think so sir  but i dont mind it i like the music  goodness whats happened to your hands   its nothing maam  they look very painful  oh no maam irritating more than painful  have you been using anything new to polish the silver or the shoes   no  may i  leave him alone mother  it looks like erysipelas   you must have cut yourself  not that im aware of  well walk to the hospital tomorrow   really maam  i insist  if youve got a cold i want you out of here  anna they are you know im out tonight  because i dont want to come home to any surprises  thatll be the day  we thought we might go to the fair later  youd like that wouldnt you daisy  now you ought to go shes been that down in the mouth  since the death of poor mr pamuk   dont say that  well she has  we could all walk down together after the servants dinner  you wont be walking anywhere  shes got minutes to live by the sound of it  go to bed at once  yes mrs hughes  ill bring up a beechams powder  right if theres anything you want to ask me  itll need to be before i go  what would i want to ask you  im preparing a meal for lord and lady grantham and the girls  noone is visiting noone is staying  well  thats settled then  im afraid dr clarksons out delivering a baby  we dont know when hell be back  no matter if you open the store cupboard  i can easily find what i need   well  you can tell the doctor  that you opened it for the chairman of the board  i assure you he will raise not the slightest objection  this should do it  tincture of steel 10 drops in water three times a day  and this is solution of nitrate of silver  rub a little in morning and night  how long before its better  erysipelas is very hard to cure  we should be able to reduce the symptoms but that might be all  oh and you must wear gloves at all times  i couldnt  wait a table in gloves id look like a footman  you may have to do  the tincture and the salve will help  try it for a week and well see  someone to see you mr crawley  well theres nothing in my diary  its lady grantham  well in that case show her in at once  cousin cora to what do i owe the  i hope im not a disappointment  i thought it might be nice to cheer it up a bit  easier said than done  perhaps a flower or a bit of veil or something  i can find you a veil if you like  i hope youre not expecting me to do it  not if youre busy of course  good  and miss obrian  ive sent anna to bed with a cold  so i need you to manage the young ladies  what all three of them im not an octopus  why cant gwen do it  because she is not a ladys maid   i am not a slave  just do it miss obrien  just do it  ill pay you the compliment that i do not believe you wish to inherit  just because nobodys investigated properly   no but  nor can mary  accuse you of making trouble  when you will suffer most from a discovery  youre right that i dont wish to benefit at marys expense   from an ignorance of the law  putting it bluntly  do you think robert has thrown in the towel prematurely  good heavens what am i sitting on  a swivel chair   another modern brainwave  invented by thomas jefferson  why does every day involve a fight with an american   ill fetch a different one  no no no no  im a good sailor  it will depend on the exact terms  of the entail and of the deed of gift  when cousin coras money was transferred to the estate  that is all i ask to understand the exact terms  is daisy going to the fair tonight with the others  why dont you ask her she needs taking out of herself   whats it to you  nothing  daisy i was hoping  would you like to go to the fair with me daisy  theres a few of us going later on  do you mean it  daisy dont let it get cold  come on come on come on  you bastard  why is sybil having a new dress and not me  because it is sybils turn  can it be my choice this time  of course as long as you choose what i choose  branson youll be taking lady sybil to ripon tomorrow   shell be leaving after lunch  certainly your ladyship  poor old madam swann  i dont know why we bother with fittings   she always makes the same frock  what do you want to make   something new and exciting  heavens look at the time  not a minute to change  and grannys invited herself for dinner  then she can jolly well wait  so womens rights begin at home i see  well im all for that  im just off mr carson  according to the wine book we should have six dozen of this  but im beggared if i can find more than four  look again before you jump  to any nasty conclusions  long time since you last took a night off   you dont think i ought to stay  certainly not be off with you  and annas in bed with a cold  so im afraid its all down to you  go  i wanted to have a go before i went home   how about you  thank you  thank you  do you know is your father doing anything this evening   hes not coming to the fair  seriously  were having dinner with his family  could i look in afterwards  may i ask why  your grandmother paid me a visit this afternoon and im  well never mind but i would like to see him  granny came to see you  is it all part of the great matter  so are you enjoying your new life  yes i think so  i know my work seems very trivial to you  not necessarily  sometimes i rather envy you  having somewhere to go every morning  i thought that may have been very middleclass  you should learn to forget what i say  i know i do  how about you is your life proving satisfactory  apart from the great matter of course  women like me dont have a life  we choose clothes and pick halls  and work for charity and do the season  but really were stuck in a waiting room  until we marry  ive made you angry  my life makes me angry not you  i never put the sauternes on ice  mrs hughes goes out for one night and we all fall to pieces  mr carlson we wondered if we could walk  down to the fair after dinner  i suppose so  but dont be too late   where do you think shes gone  none of your business  like most of what goes on round here  well caught that man though i say it myself  thanks ever so  yes   youve cheered up a bit  hes so agile int he  he could have been a sportsman  who   thomas of course  really  which sport did he have in mind  i ran into cousin matthew in the village  he wanted to call on you after dinner  apparently grannys been to see him  did you tell him shes coming here this evening  i didnt know she was  when he arrives do your best  to keep her in the drawing room  well id like to see you try  dont stay too long let them have an early night  sybil darling why would you want to go to a real school  youre not a doctors daughter  nobody learns anything from a governess  apart from french and how to curtsy  what else do you need  well theres  are you thinking of a career in banking  no but it is a noble profession  things are different in america  i know they live in wigwams  and when they come out of them they go to school  if you wait in the library ill tell papa youre here  thank you  elsie   it is elsie isnt it  it is  though theres very few left to call me that joe burns  well im flattered that im one of them  wheres thomas  im fear i let the servants go down to the fair milord  i didnt know wed have any visitors tonight  well thats all right they dont have much fun  you should join them  so what did you say to mama  i havent spoken to her since her visit  but i have looked through every source  and i cant find one reason on which to base a challenge  i could have told you that  im not quite sure how to  phrase it when i tell her  she shouldnt have put you on the spot like that  it was unkind  im afraid shell think ive failed  because i dont want to succeed  she will think that but i dont and nor will cora  of course its impossible for mary  she must resent me so bitterly  i dont blame her  yes it must have been hard for you when ivy died  it took some getting used to  what about your son do you see much of him  peter no  i would have given him a share of the farm if he wanted it  but hes joined the army  well i never  aye he seems happy but its left me on my own   shall i take your plates then  thank you   so hows life treated you  oh i cant complain  i havent travelled  but ive seen a bit of life and no mistake  i notice you call yourself missus  housekeepers and cooks are always missus  you know better than anyone i havent changed my name  well i know you wouldnt change it to burns  when you had the chance  you shouldnt have eaten with us  the chauffeur always eats in his own cottage  steady on you can cut him a bit of slack on his second day  im waiting to take old lady grantham home  even then taylor never ate with us  youre taking advantage of mrs hughes absence  what are you doing  im sorting the collars  removing the ones that have come to an end  what happens to his lordships old clothes  whats it to you  clothes are a valets perk not a chauffeurs  i get some but mostly it goes into the missionary barrel  i know its meant to be kind  but i can think of better ways of helping the needy  than sending stiff collars to the equator  i thought anna might have come down for her dinner  and show shes ready to start work again  not a chance   is she still in bed then  she is  while im sat here sewing like a  cursed princess in a fairy tale  and not down at the fair with the others  would you like me to ask branson to bring the car round milady  wheres robert  he cant have been drinking port since we left  hed be under the table by now  his lordships in the library   all alone oh how sad  no hes  we can say goodbye to papa for you granny  hes what  hes with mr crawley milady  the question is what do i say to cousin violet  dont worry about that i can handle her  really  well if you can you must have learned to very recently  anna  sr bates  can you open the door  i darent  noone can open that door except mrs hughes  just for a moment ive brought you something  i dont know what  what i dont understand in all this is you  you seem positively glad to see mary disinherited  you speak as if we had a choice  thank you branson  im worn out tell lady mary and mr crawley ive gone to bed  shall i tell them now milord  no wait until they ring  i like this one   yes sir  i ought to start back   this is very late for me  aw not yet  its a long time since ive had a  girl to show off for at the fair  so i take it you never get lonely  well thats working in a big house  though there are times when you yearn for a bit of solitude  we have a winner  thank you  right well er something to remind you of me  i dont need help to remember you  but what happens when you retire  i should think if i stay here theyll look after me  suppose they sell the estate  suppose theres a tidal wave  suppose we all die of the plague suppose theres a war  what did i tell you shes found her romeo  he might be her brother  she hasnt got one or wed know  just a sister in lytham st annes  you know everything dont you  everything my foot  youre hiding behind him  but hes not what you think he is  oh go home william  if youre gonna be such a spoilsport  all right i will  come back she didnt mean it  i must go  but its been lovely to see you again joe  really  and you know what im asking  you havent asked anything yet  but you know what it is when i do  im going to stop here at the pub until i hear from you  oh and take your time  id rather wait a week for the right answer then  get a wrong one in a hurry  think about it carefully  i will  i promise you that  to break the entail wed need  a private bill in parliament  even then it would only be passed  if the estate were in danger  which its not  and i mean nothing in all this  on the contrary you mean a great deal  a very great deal   you rang milady  yes carson  mr crawley was just leaving  do you know where his lordship is  gone to bed milady  he felt tired after he put lady grantham into the car  i bet he did thank you carson  im sorry i wish i could think of  something to say that would help  theres nothing  but you mustnt let it trouble you  it does trouble me  it troubles me very much  then that will be my consolation prize  good night cousin matthew  good night  i hope i havent kept you up too late  im afraid weve interfered with your dinner  its been rather a chopandchange evening downstairs  lady grantham got off all right  all right is an optimistic assessment sir  its very difficult carson  for her for lady mary   for everyone  it is mr crawley  but i appreciate your saying so  well thats her greatness done and dusted for the night  will have you had a good night  im off to bed  wait   what happened  nothing doesnt matter  how was your evening mrs hughes  very enjoyable thank you  the others are just behind me  so you can lock up in a minute  well ill say good night   good night mrs hughes  good night  night mrs hughes  good night mrs hughes  i was right when i said she was looking sparkly eyed  i beg your pardon thomas  he can disapprove all he likes  mrs hughes has got a fancy man  him a fancy man  dont be so nasty daisy it doesnt suit you  i reckon theres a job vacancy coming up  miss obrian do you fancy a promotion  very droll if shes got a boyfriend  im a giraffe  leave me alone mr bates  i know you mean well but let me be  what chance did he have up against a champion  well you listen  you filthy little rat  if you dont lay off i will punch your shining teeth  through the back of your skull  is this supposed to frighten me mr bates  because if it is it isnt working  im sorry but its just not working  daisy chafing dishes now  right in front of you mrs patmore  are you trying to trick me  annas still not well obrien  youll need to dress the girls this morning  all we know about lady mary  and here i am waiting on her hand and foot   will we do anything with that  maybe but not yet  what do you look like  daisy what do you think he looks like  do your buttons up  well go on then  what do you want  ive got a message for lady sybil  from her ladyship  thank you obrien ill manage now  odious woman  what does mama want  i just said that to get rid of her  this came today  i knew they would want to see you  its your reference whats done it  how am i going to get there they wont let me take a day off  youre going to be ill  they cant stop you being ill  what  noone has seen anna for a whole day  they wont notice if you vanish for a couple of hours  the only one who never sticks up for me in all this is you  why is that  you are my darling daughter and i love you  hard as it is for an englishman to say the words  well then  if i had made my own fortune and bought downton myself  it should be yours without question  but i did not  my fortune is the work of others  who laboured to build a great dynasty  do i have the right to destroy their work  or impoverish that dynasty  i am a custodian my dear not an owner  i must strive to be worthy  of the task ive been set  if i could take mamas money out of the estate  downton would have to be sold to pay for it  is that what you want  to see matthew a landless peer  with a title but no means to pay for it  so im just to find a husband and get out of the way  you could stay here if you married matthew  you know my character father  id never marry any man that i was told to  im stubborn i wish i wasnt but i am  will you have your own way do you think with the frock  only i couldnt help overhearing yesterday  and from what her ladyship said  it sounded as if you support womens rights  i suppose i do  because im quite political  in fact i brought some pamphlets  that i thought might interest you  about the vote  thank you  but please dont mention this to my father or my grandmother  one whiff of reform and she hears the rattle of the guillotine  it seems rather unlikely a revolutionary chauffeur  maybe  but im a socialist not a revolutionary  and i wont always be a chauffeur  mrs crawley how nice  youre busy we can come back later  molesley  what are you doing here are you ill  poor old mr molesley hows it going  the solution doesnt seem to make it any better  my imaginations running riot  ive got erysipelas your ladyship  i am sorry  mrs crawley tells me shes recommended  nitrate of silver and tincture of steel  why is she making a suit of armour  but i take it theres been no improvement  not really  and youre sure its erysipelas  that is mrs crawleys diagnosis  what it is to have medical knowledge  it has its uses  i see your father has been making changes at home  he has milady hes got no use for the herb garden  now my mothers gone   and youve been helping him  i have  grubbing out the old rue hedge  how did you know that  because this is not erysipelas  this is a rue allergy  if molesley wears gardening gloves  itll be gone in a week  please dont think were ungrateful  for your enthusiasm mrs crawley  but there comes a time when things are best  left to the professionals   but i  and now i really  i really must go  good day  thank you your ladyship  i hope cousin violet has recovered from last night  whatever she says my mother is as strong as an ox  its high time she let go of her  scheme for upsetting everything  time we all did  i cant deny im pleased to hear it  are you beginning to see a future here then  in a way this business has forced me to recognise  that i do want downton to be my future  im glad  you must have thought me an awful  prig when i first arrived  not a prig just a man thrust into  something he never wanted or envisaged  i could only see the absurdity of the whole thing   im sorry  well there are absurdities involved  as i know well enough  possibilities too and i was blind to them  i was determined not to let it change me  it was absurd if you dont change you die  do you think so  im not sure sometimes i think i hate change  at least we can comfort ourselves that this will still be here  because we saved it  thomas is lovely int he  hes funny and handsome   hes got such lovely teeth  hes not for you daisy  course not hes too good for me i know that  no hes not too good   what then  hes not the boy for you  and youre not the girl for him  int that what i just said  and why would he be when hes seen and done so much  and ive been nowhere and done nothing  perhaps thomas has seen and done more than is good for him  hes not a ladys man   well int it a blessed relief  daisy  thomas is a troubled soul  i dont know what you mean mrs patmore  nothing  i dont mean anything  except if i dont get the ice cream started  theyll be dining at midnight  golly my corsets tight  anna when youve done that be an angel and loosen it a bit  the start of the slippery slope  im not putting on weight  it didnt shrink in the draw  are you coming down  i dont know why we bother with corsets  men dont wear them and they look  perfectly normal in their clothes   not all of them  shes just showing off  shell be on about the vote in a minute  if you mean do i think women should have the vote  of course i do  i hope you wont chain yourself to the railings  and end up being forcefed semolina  what do you think anna  i think those women are very brave  hearhear  how did you get on with your dressmaker   find anything  i did  and she says she can have it done by friday  im sorry i couldnt come but i didnt want to put matthew off  edith were you pleased with the work on the cottages  i think theyre making a very good job of them  you must all go and see  youll restore a few every year  it was matthews idea  old crips was rather reluctant  but im pleased we went forward   i suppose its worth it  of course it is  because of the people who will live in them  i be glad to hear matthews conscience  is much more energetic than mine  excuse me im going to bed ive rather a headache  of course   should i bring you something for it  no ill be perfectly fine  if i can just lie down  mary  oh my darling  what is it  you heard him  matthew this matthew that matthew matthew matthew  oh mother dont you see  he has a son now of course he didnt argue with the entail  why would he when hes got what he always wanted  your father loves you very much  he wouldnt fight for me though  because he knew he couldnt win   youre no better  what  you dont care that matthew gets everything  because you dont think im worthy  mary  i wish youd just admit it  im a lost soul to you  i took lover with no thought of marriage a turk  oh think of that oh my dear  dont worry mama  you can go down now  everything will look better in the morning  isnt that what you usually say  i say it because its usually true  papa will wonder where you are   dont quarrel with matthew  why shouldnt i  because one day you may need him  oh i see  when ive ruined myself  i must have a powerful protector to hide behind  id tell you off   but i like to hear you play   where are they all  busy i suppose  havent you got anything to do  yes i have  of course i have  you mustnt let thomas get you down  hes just jealous  everyone likes you better than him  not everyone  then shes a foolish girl and she doesnt deserve you  though why am i encouraging you  forget all that for  youre a kind woman mrs hughes  i dont know how this house would run without you  i dont truly  stopped flannelling and get on  before i betray you to mr carson  is there anything more thrilling than a new frock  i suppose not milady  you shall have one too  i thought this would be suitable for your interview   i wont be wearing it milady  of course you will  we have to make you look like  a successful professional woman  what is it whats happened  well i wont wear it because im not going  theyve cancelled the appointment  they found someone more suited for the post   and better qualified  this time  lets face it  there will never be anyone less suited for the post  or worse qualified than i am  that isnt true  youll see were not giving up  noone hits the bullseye with the first arrow  ive put out the rundle candlesticks for dinner tonight  oh im sorry ill come back later  no stay please  ive got something id like to talk to you about  if youve a minute  before i first came here as head housemaid  i was walking out with a farmer  when i told him id taken a job at downton  he asked me to marry him  i was a farmers daughter from argyll so i knew the life  he was very nice  but then i came here and i did well  and i didnt want to give it up so i told him no  and he married someone else  she died three years ago  and last month he wrote asking to see me again  and i agreed because all this time ive wondered  go on  i met him the other night  we had dinner at the grantham arms and after he took me to the fair  and he was horrible and fat and redfaced  and you couldnt think what you ever saw in him  he was still a nice man  he is still a nice man  well he was a bit redfaced  and his suit was a little tight  but none of that matters  in the real ways he hadnt changed  and he proposed again  and you accepted  in many ways i wanted to accept  but im not that farm girl any more  i was flattered of course but   ive changed mr carson  lifes altered you as its altered me  and what would be the point of living  if we didnt let life change us  you wont be leaving then  youd better come mrs patmores on the rampage  she wants the key to the store cupboard  you know how angry she gets she hasnt got one  nor will she have not while im housekeeper here  leaving when would i ever find the time   i have to go cap in hand to mary queen of scots  whatever is holding sybil up  she was going on about her new frock  wed better go in without her  or its not fair on mrs patmore  oh is her cooking so precisely timed  you couldnt tell  i think her food is delicious  naturally  good evening everyone  why should you be burdened with marys secret  theres a rumour in london that you are not virtuous  i wish youd just come out with it  with what  whatever it is youre keeping secret  isnt it possible i should win the thing on merit  i think the appropriate answer to that is yes dear   maybe ill shine by comparison  maybe you will
