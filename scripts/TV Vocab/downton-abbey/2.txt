son mr matthew crawley  ill just give mr taylor a hand with the cases   i can  thank you molesley  i wont let them change me  why would they want to  mother lord grantham has made the unwelcome discovery  that his heir is a middleclass lawyer   and the son of a middle class doctor  upper middle class  he wants to limit the damage by turning me into one of his own kind  when you met him in london you liked him  i simply do not understand why we are rushing into this  matthew crawley is my heir  patrick was your heir he never lived here  patrick was in and out of this house since the day he was born  you saw how many of the village turned out for the service   nothings settled yet it  is settled my dearest one  whether you like it or not  i wouldnt say that  not while your mother breathes air  oh ellen  this is much better than i thought it would be   you have done well  thank you maam  would you like this in here maam or taken up to your room  in here thank you  so are you the whole of our new household  theres a local girl maam beth  shes to double underhousemaid and kitchen maid   this is ridiculous  thank you very much molesley   might we have some tea  very good maam   well he can go right now  why  because we do not need a butler or a valet if it comes to that  weve always managed perfectly well with a cook and a maid   and they cannot expect us to  what they expect matthew  is that we wont know how to behave so if you dont mind  i would rather not confirm their expectations  i have to be myself mother  ill be no use to anyone if i cant be myself  and before they or you get any ideas   i will choose my own wife  what on earth do you mean  theyll push one of the daughters at me  theyll have fixed on that when they heard i was a bachelor  lady mary

a capital offence  shes got a maid her names ellen  shes not a ladys maid  shes just a housemaid  that fastens hooks and buttons when she has to  theres more to it than that you know  daisy  we want some very precise reporting when dinners over   are we to treat him as the heir  are we eck as like  a doctors son from manchester  hell be lucky if he gets a civil word out of me  were all lucky if we get a civil word out of you  gwen parcel for you came by evening post  thank you mr carson  william  have you seen them yet mr carson  by them i assume you mean the new family in which case no  i

employer  and if it goes wrong ill be telling them why  why are they here at all when youre going to undo it  your fathers not convinced it can be undone  but youll still try  granny and i are willing to try  and papa is not  well bring him round youll see  were trying to find a lawyer wholl take it on  so what are they like  shes nice enough  but hesvery full of himself   why do you say that  just an impression  lets go down and you can decide for yourself  hello again  its a pleasure to meet you at last mrs crawley  were delighted to be here   arent we matthew  delighted  welcome to downton  thank you youve been so kind  what a reception committee  yes thank you  this is carson wed all be lost without him  mama may i present matthew crawley and mrs crawley  my mother lady grantham  what should we call each other  well we could always start with mrs crawley and lady grantham  come into the drawing room and we can make all the introductions  thank you carson  do you think youll enjoy village life  itll be very quiet after life in the city  even manchester  im sure ill find something to keep me busy   you might like the hospital  what sort of hospital is it  how many beds  well it isnt really a hospital  dont let dr clarkson hear you  he thinks its second only to st thomass  its a cottage hospital of course but quite well equipped  who pays for it  oh good lets talk about money  my father gave the building and an endowment to run it  in a way he set up his own memorial  but how splendid  and mr lloyd georges new insurance measures will help  please dont speak that mans name we are about to eat  i will hold it steady and you can help yourself sir  yes i know  thank you  youll soon get used to the way things are done here  if you mean that i am accustomed to a very different life from this  then that is true  what will you do with your time  ive got a job in ripon  i said ill start tomorrow  a job  in a partnership you might have heard of it harvell and carter  they need someone who understands industrial law im glad to say  although im afraid most of it will be wills and conveyancing  you do know i mean to involve you in the running of the estate  well dont worry there are plenty of hours in the day  and of course ill have the weekend  well discuss this later we mustnt bore the ladies  what is a weekend   why shouldnt he be a lawyer  gentlemen dont work silly  not real gentlemen   dont listen to her daisy  no listen to me  and take those kidneys up to the servery before i  knock you down and serve your brains as fritters  yes mrs patmore  i wonder what that mr molesley makes of them  poor old molesley i pity the man whos taken that job  then why did you apply for it  i thought it might help me to get away from you mr bates  im so interested to see the hospital  well you would be with your late husband a doctor  not just my husband  my father and brother too and i trained as a nurse during the war  fancy  id love to be involved in some way  well you could always help with the bringandbuy sale next month  that would be most appreciated  i should say so  shes a match for the old lady  she wasnt going to give in  what old lady are you referring to thomas  you cannot mean her ladyship the dowager countess  not if you wish to remain in this house  no mr carson  william  are you aware the seam at your shoulder is coming apart  ii felt it go a bit earlier on ill mend it when we turn in  you will mend it now and you will never again appear in public   in a similar state of undress  no mr carson  to progress in your chosen career william  you must remember that a good servant at all times  retains a sense of pride and dignity  that reflects the pride and dignity of the family he serves  and never make me remind you of it again  ill do it  and cheer up weve all had a smack from mr carson  youll be the butler yourself one day   then youll do the smacking  i could never be like him  i bet he comes from a line of butlers  that goes back to the conqueror  he learned his business and so will you  even mr carson wasnt born standing to attention  i hope not for his mothers sake  this was at the back door  thank you william  its kind of you to take an interest  im afraid its a case of the warhorse and the drum  you know my late husband was a doctor  i do im familiar with dr crawleys work  on the symptoms of infection in children  even i studied nursing during the south african war  really  very distressing  young farmer john drake tenant of lord granthams  he came in today  its dropsy im afraid   may i see him  yes by all means  is the dropsy of the liver or the heart  everything points to the heart  alright mr drake youre in safe hands now  what will happen to his wife  she may try to keep the farm on  grantham is not a harsh landlord but  her children are young  what can i do to help  if im to live in this village i must have an occupation  please let me be useful  he chooses his clothes himself  he puts them out at night  and hangs the ones hes worn  i get to take the linen down to the laundry but thats about all  thats all  ill do this he says ill take the other ill tie that  and im just stood there like a chump  watching a man get dressed  to be honest mr bates  i dont see the point of it   i thought you didnt like him  so what  i have plenty of friends i dont like  would you want mary to marry one of them  why do you always have to pretend to be nicer than the rest of us  perhaps i am  then pity your wife  whose fortune must go to this odd young man  who talks about weekends and jobs  if mary were to marry him then all would be resolved   what have you got there  nothing  what kind of nothing  you havent got an admirer  i might have why shouldnt i  dont tell mrs hughes  shell bring the vicar round to have you exorcised  how are we supposed to find husbands  if were never allowed to see any men  perhaps she thinks the stork brings them  ey lady marys in for a surprise  thomas was in the library when old violet came in from the garden  seems they want to fix her up with mr crawley  well it makes sense she was gonna marry mr patrick  would she have though when it came to it  thats the question  ah there you are dear  i was hoping youd be home in time  in time for what  ive been paid the compliment of a visit   hello  good afternoon cousin matthew  good afternoon  we were just saying how charming this room is now  mm it always seemed rather dark when my motherinlaw lived here  but then she made everything rather dark  sir no thank you   cup of tea sir  its alright ill help myself  so molesley  how do you find being home again  your father must be glad youre back  he is your ladyship   might i give you this cup  maam  im afraid we must be going  thank you  youll think about it  oh i thought no one was here  can i help mr carson  no no thank you anna  may i  i must compliment you mrs crawley  when you made your offer i thought you might be a great lady nurse  and faint at the sight of blood  but i see youre made of sterner stuff  its definitely the heart  its almost too quiet to hear at all  im afraid so  ive been thinking about the treatments that are available  considerable success has been achieved over the last few years  by draining the pericardial sac of the excess fluid  and administering adrenalin  mrs crawley i appreciate your thoroughness  but youre unwilling to try it  injection of adrenalin is a comparatively new procedure  its a while ago now but i saw my husband do it   i know how  please mrs crawley  dont force me to be uncivil  we will be setting an impossible precedent  when every villager could  could demand the latest fad in treatment  for each new cut and graze  i would remind you that were not talking of a cut or a graze  but the loss of a mans life and the ruin of his family  of course  but i beg you to see that it is not reasonable  im sorry but i have standards  ive just seen something ever so odd  if anyone thinks im going to pull my forelock and curtsey  to this mr nobody from nowhere  obrien  were you discussing mr crawley  yes mlady  is it your place to do so  ive got my opinions mlady same as anybody  can i help your ladyship  this is the button were missing from my new evening coat  i found it lying on the gravel  but i was shocked  at the talk i heard as i came in  mr crawley is his lordships cousin and heir  you will therefore please accord him the respect he is entitled to  but you dont like him yourself mlady  you never wanted him  youre sailing perilously close to the wind obrien  if were to be friends you will not speak in that way again  about the crawleys or any member of lord granthams family  now im going up to rest wake me at the dressing gong  i dont think thats fair not here in the servants hall  i agree if she was a real lady she wouldnt have come down here  shed have rung for me and given me the button  this isnt her territory we can say what we like down here   who says  the law  and parliament  there is such a thing as free speech  not when im in charge  dont push your luck thomas  now teas over back to work  youd better take this  friends  who does she think shes fooling were not friends   no  no  and youre not friends with the girls neither  were servants you and me  and they pay us to do as were told thats all   may i  i can manage  where have i put my cuff links   i thought these would make a change  where are my usual ones  i know im a disappointment to you molesley  but its no good  ill never get used to being dressed like a doll   im only trying to help sir  of course  and if ive offended you i apologise  but surely you have better things to do  this is my job sir  well it seems a very silly occupation for a grown man  look im sorry if im  im sorry  why are you so against him  aside from the fact hes planning to steal our inheritance  your inheritance  it makes no difference to sybil and me  we wont inherit whatever happens  he isnt one of us  cousin freddys studying for the bar  and so is vivian macdonald  at lincolns inn  not sitting at a dirty little desk in ripon  besides his father was a doctor  theres nothing wrong with doctors we all need doctors  we all need crossing sweepers and draymen too  it doesnt mean we have to dine with them  whom dont we have to dine with  mary doesnt care for cousin matthew  sybil be a dear and fetch my black evening shawl  obrien knows which one  and edith can you see that the drawing rooms ready  im glad to catch you alone   youve driven the others away  perhaps i have  pretty  the point is my dear i dont want you any of you  to feel you have to dislike matthew   you disliked the idea of him  that was before he came  now hes here i dont see any future in it  not the way things are  i dont believe a woman can be forced to give away all her money  to a distant cousin of her husbands  not in the 20th century its too ludicrous for words  its not as simple as that the money isnt mine anymore   it forms a part of the estate  even so when a judge hears  for once in your life will you please just listen  i believe theres an answer  which would secure your future and give you a position  you cant be serious  just think about it  i dont have to think about it  marry a man who can barely hold his knife like a gentleman  oh you exaggerate  youre american you dont understand these things  have you mentioned this to granny did she laugh  why would she it was her idea  have you been able to explore the village  indeed i have and i thought the hospital  a great credit to your fathers memory  but im afraid the good doctor and i did not see eye to eye  oh you amaze me  hes treating one of your tenants john drake for dropsy  but seems reluctant to embrace some of the newer treatments  drake is a good man and far too young to die  but i suppose the doctor knows his business  not as well as mrs crawley apparently  by the way if ever you want to ride just let lynch know  and hell sort it out for you  oh papa cousin matthew doesnt ride  i ride   and do you hunt  no i dont hunt  i dare say theres not much opportunity in manchester  are you a hunting family  families like ours are always hunting families  not always billy skelton wont have them on his land  but all the skeltons are mad   do you hunt  occasionally  i suppose youre more interested in books than country sports  i probably am  youll tell me thats rather unhealthy  not unhealthy just unusual  among our kind of people  im changing round the dessert services  were missing a sugar sifter i know i put three out  i was talking to anna earlier  why whats she been saying   whatevers the matter  what did anna say  only that she thinks thomas is bullying william  ah yes she may have a point  ill keep an eye out  here it is  ive been studying the story of andromeda do you know it   why  her father was king cepheus  whose country was being ravaged by storms  and in the end he decided the only way to appease the gods  was to sacrifice his eldest daughter to a hideous sea monster  so they chained her naked to a rock  really mary  well all need our smelling salts in a minute  but the sea monster didnt get her did he  no  just when it seemed he was the only solution to her fathers problems  she was rescued   by perseus  thats right  perseus  son of a god  rather more fitting wouldnt you say  that depends  id have to know more about the princess and the sea monster in question  i wish i could dance like that  like what  dont you know the grizzly bear  the grizzly bear as if you do  certainly i do miss obrien shall we show them  not likely  william give us a tune come on daisy  hands up  daisy daisy  stop that silly nonsense before you put your joints out  see to the range and go to bed  thank you that was beautiful  im sorry mary was rather sharp this evening  i doubt if cousin mary and i are destined to be close friends  i dont blame her  her fathers home and her mothers fortune are to be passed to me  its very harsh  well what would you say   if the entail were set aside in marys favour  i should try to accept it with as good a grace as i could muster  would you  good evening taylor   good evening mlady  thank you  ill say good night mr carson  look at that scratch  ill have to get that sorted out while theyre up in london   you can hardly see it  well ill know its there  are you alright now only you seemed a little upset earlier  yeah im sorry about that im just um   a bit tired  and no wonder did the dinner go well  oh well enough  they wont make a match between them if thats what theyre thinking  lady mary doesnt like him  and why should she like the man shes been passed over for  and why has she been   thats what id like to know  its the law  well its a wicked law  why does mr carson let you do that  because my dad was a clock maker  did you really ask him for the job with the crawleys  im sick of being a footman  id rather be a footman than wait on someone  who ought to be a footman himself  but mr carson shouldnt have told bates  how are things with lady g  same as usual  yes mlady no mlady three bags full  id like to give her three bags full preferably on a dark night  will you hand in your notice  and let her ruin me with a nasty reference  oh i think not  i dont want to exaggerate shes been very generous in many ways  generous  to instruct you in your own practice  she may even have a point  but it does not seem to me realistic  well nor is it  put an end to her meddling  i am your president and i say get rid of her  will that not be awkward  shes planning to stay in the village for the foreseeable future  no one can foresee the future doctor  not you not i and certainly not mrs crawley  you do not love the place yet   well obviously its  no you dont love it  you see a million bricks that may crumble  a thousand gutters and pipes that may block and leak  and stone that will crack in the frost  but you dont  i see my lifes work  was it ever in danger  many times  my dear papa thought the balloon would go up in the 1880s  what saved it  cora  where is everyone  theyve gone down to the village  some travelling salesman set up at the pub for the afternoon  alone at last  we shouldnt be without both footmen  does mr carson know  mrs hughes does shes gone with them  they wont be long  so you see to the girls  and youre supposed to be head housemaid  you should put in for a raise  what do you mean supposed to be  i said they shouldnt have let both footmen go  well youll have to answer it  mr carson wouldnt like a maid answering the front door  sorry to have kept you waiting sir  im here to see lord grantham   is he expecting you  no  but hell be very interested in what i have to tell him  his lordship is not at home but if you will leave your name  dont come all high and mighty with me  i dont know who you are but youre certainly not the butler  so dont try and make out you are  how do you know  because charlie carsons the butler round here  does your business concern him  it might do  excuse me for one moment sir  fetch mr carson as fast as you can  use the front door   if you would like to follow me sir  no no  if you think youre tucking me away somewhere  youve got another think coming   youll be more comfortable sir  sorry chum  oh aye  ill not mind waiting in here  bates  this gentlemen is an acquaintance of mr carson mlady  whats he doing in here  he says he has urgent business with his lordship  urgent  ive sent for mr carson to come at once  then ill stay with you  in case explanations are needed  thank you  mr carson  youre needed at once in the library  how long are you expecting me to wait  im a very busy man you know  if you could just be patient for a little longer sir  may i ask who this is and precisely what is going on  mr bates what are you  im sorry your lordship   mr bates you may go now  stay where you are  nobodys going anywhere  do i take it you know this man  dont try and deny it  no i wont deny it  i do know him my lord  but not what he is doing in the library  i tried to take him downstairs out of sight mr carson but he wouldnt come  yes thank you that was thoughtful  but who is he  will you tell him or shall i  his name is charles grigg  we worked together at one time  oh im a little more than that arent i charlie   were like brothers him and me  we are not like brothers  we were a double act  on the halls  you were on the stage  carson is this true  it is my lord  the cheerful charlies thats what they called us  we did quite well didnt we  until you couldnt keep your hands out of the till   would you like us to go mr carson  no  you know it now  you might as well bear witness to my shame  he turned up in the village with no warning some days ago  on the run asking for somewhere to hide and of course for money  god in heaven  he is wanted for some petty crime of which he is of course guilty  here steady on  he threatened to expose my past  to make me a laughing stock in this house  and in my vanity and pride  i gave him what he wanted  you did not  i put him in an empty cottage and fed him from the kitchens  i couldnt buy food in the village  it would raise to many questions  i stole  im a thief  shesaw it   ive never have said anything mr  and now my disgrace is complete  my lord you have my resignation  really carson theres no need to be quite so melodramatic  youre not playing sidney carton  so why have you come here  if he has done everything you asked of him  because he hasnt  he wouldnt give me any money  if i had how could i prevent his returning to downton  once it was spent  my dear mr grigg  oh its nice to see someones got some manners  hold your tongue  ill tell you what is going to happen  when i have given you 20 you will leave downton immediately  and we will never set eyes on you again  ill have to see about that  if you return to this area  i will personally ensure your conviction for theft and blackmail   just a minute  you will serve from five to 10 years  in his majestys custody  you think youre such a big man dont you  just cos youre a lord you think you can do what you like with me  i think it   because it is true  youll not always be in charge you know  the day is coming when your lot will have to tow the line   just like the rest of us  perhaps  but happily for carson  that day has not come yet  i take it my resignation has not been accepted  my dear fellow we all have chapters we would rather keep unpublished  to be honest carson   im rather impressed  did you really sing and dance in front of an audience  i did  and do you ever miss it  not in the least my lord  poor mr carson  well have to treat him like a god for a month to calm his nerves  hell be afraid this will change the way we think of him   then we mustnt let it  oh but it will  the cheerful charlies  for all his talk of dignity we know his story now   and admire him more because of it  maybe  but it will change the way we think of him it always does  i dont see why  i shouldnt care what i found out about you  whatever it was  it wouldnt alter my opinion one bit  but it would it certainly would  were running out of options  the lawyers i write to only huff and puff  they echo murray and say nothing can be done  or they dont want the bother of opposing him  precisely  i wish mary wasnt so confident it could all be put right  meanwhile we have to watch that dreadful woman  parade around the village as if she owned it   i think she means well  meaning well is not enough  poor dr clarkson  what has he done to deserve that termagant  i think hes in for an uncomfortable afternoon  really why  on my way here i saw her go into the hospital  she looked extremely determined  not as determined as i am  i have the adrenalin here in my hand  will you really deny the man his chance of life  i just wish it was a treatment i was more familiar with  will that serve as your excuse when he dies  nurse  will you prepare mr drake for his procedure please  well mrs crawley  i have a feeling we will sink or swim together  mr drake your heart is not functioning properly  and as a result the pericardial sac is full of fluid  i am proposing first to withdraw the fluid  and then to inject the adrenalin to stimulate the heart and  restore normal activity  is it dangerous doctor  the draining may stop the heart  and the adrenalin may not be able to restart it  mrs drake the choice is simple  if your husband endures this procedure he may life  if not he will die   hes with a patient  no let me pass  i must see the doctorat once  your ladyship  it is just as i thought  doctor clarkson  tell me you will not permit this amateur  to influence your professional opinion   amateur  my dear woman  do not let them bully you  theyll not disturb the peace of your husbands last hours  if i can help it  but thats just it my lady  i dont want them to be his last hours  not if theres a chance  please doctor  do what you must  as  steady  yep alright  nice and steady  as president of this hospital i feel i must  valve  tell you   i shall bring this to the attention of the board  youre doing very well  have you no pity  adrenalin  quickly quickly  his hearts stopped  ready  yes  oh john  my dear  you dont have to worry  she may be president but i am the patron  so youre quite safe with me please  my mother was right then  the mans life was saved  well i like to think we were both right  but im not sure lady grantham will be so easily convinced  then we must strengthen the argument  cousin isobel wants something to do very well  lets make her chairman of the board   shed like that wouldnt she  certainly she would  then my mother will have to listen to her  shes been an absolute ruler there for long enough  its time for some loyal opposition  well if youre quite certain my lord  what were you going to say  well at the risk of being impertinent  on your own head be it  about your scheme for restoring the estate cottages  you dont mind my interfering  my dear fellow i brought you here to interfere  in fact why dont you stay for dinner and well talk about it  well send down to molesley for your clothes  i better not my mothers expecting me  in fact ive been meaning to speak to you about molesley  would you find me very ungrateful if i dispensed with his services  why has he displeased you in some way  not at all its simply that hes superfluous to our style of living  is that quite fair  to deprive a man of his livelihood when hes done nothing wrong   well i wouldnt quite put it  your mother derives satisfaction  from her work at the hospital i think some sense of selfworth   well certainly  would you really  deny the same to poor old molesley  and when you are master here is the butler to be dismissed or the footman  how many maids or kitchen staff will be allowed to stay  or must every one be driven out  we all have different parts to play matthew  and we must all be allowed to play them  why must we all go to the hospital  im afraid papa wants to teach granny a lesson  poor granny a month ago these people were strangers  now she must share power with the mother and i must marry the son  you wont marry him though will you  what marry a sea monster  we shouldnt laugh thats so unkind  but he must marry someone  edith what are you thinking  you know i dont dislike him as much as you do  perhaps you dont dislike him at all  perhaps i dont  well its nothing to me ive bigger fish to fry  what fish are we talking about en  how do you know that have you been poking around in my things  of course not come on  who is he its not fair if you both know  you wont be any the wiser but his name is evelyn napier  the honourable evelyn napier  son and heir to viscount branksome  who wants an old sea monster when they can have perseus  if youre going to the ceremony i thought we might walk together  certainly im going  i want to see the old bats face when they announce it  i must try not to look too cheerful  or shouldnt i talk like that in your presence  do you find me very ridiculous mrs hughes  putting on airs and graces ive no right to  whats brought this on  nothing  except at times i wonder if im just a sad old fool  mr carson  you are a man of integrity and honour  who raises the tone of this household by being part of it  so no more of that please  come on we mustnt be late  i wondered if youd like to walk with me down to  is thomas going  well i think everyone is  sorry what were you saying  nothing doesnt matter  put this away before you go   and never mind your flirting  i wasnt flirting not with him  williams not a bad lad  hes nice enough but he isnt like thomas  no hes not  cuff links sir  those are a dull option for such an occasion  dont you agree  might i suggest the crested pair sir  they seem more appropriate if you dont mind me saying  theyre a bit fiddly i wonder if you could help me  certainly sir  oh i see you got that mark out of the sleeve how did you do it  i tried it with this and tried it with that until it yielded  very well done  thank you sir  you go in mrs hughes i want a quick word with mr bates here  mr bates  i must thank you  both for what you did and for keeping silent afterwards  it was kind of you and anna  it was nothing mr carson  well i hope you dont judge me too harshly  i dont judge you at all i have no right to judge you or any man  ladies and gentlemen welcome to this happy event  the investiture of our first chairwoman mrs reginald crawley  who has graciously agreed to share the duties of our beloved president  the dowager countess of grantham  our little hospital must surely grow and thrive  with two such doughty champions united as they are  by the strongest ties of all family and friendship  lady mary crawley i presume  mary has more suitors tonight than the princess aurora  is that one mine  i hope the days living up to your expectations  exceeding them in every way
