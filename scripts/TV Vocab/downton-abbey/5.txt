                you made me jump  daisy what is the matter with you youre all thumbs   sorry i hate this room  why  whats the matter with it  daisy  whos that from papa you seem very absorbed   your aunt rosamond  anything interesting  nothing to trouble you with  poor aunt rosamond all alone in that big house   i feel so sorry for her  i dont  all alone with plenty of money in a house in eaton square  i cant imagine anything better  really mary i wish you wouldnt talk like that  there will come a day when someone thinks you mean what you say  it cant come soon enough for me  carson ill be in the library  will you let me know when her ladyship is down   certainly milord  sybil darling this ones for you  i saw another opening for a secretary and i applied  but you never said  i didnt want you to be disappointed  i thought youd given up  ill never give up and nor will you  things are changing for women  not just the vote but our lives  but its tomorrow at ten o clock  last time we waited for weeks and weeks and this ones tomorrow  then we must be ready by tomorrow mustnt we  i thought id write to edith   to settle our promised church visit  if you want  we cant throw her over when she made such effort for the last one   its all in your head  i dont think so  then shes barking up the wrong tree  poor edith i hope theres a right tree for her somewhere  maam i was wondering if i might take some time this afternoon to help in the village hall   why whats happening  its the flower show sir next saturday           ill give my father a hand       with his stall if i may       of course you must go  and so im afraid must i  is mr carson about  i dont think so i was just looking for him myself  busy  im just trying to sort out the wretched flower show  ive had a letter from rosamond dont tell me  she wants saddle of lamb and all the fruit and vegetables we can muster  she enjoys a taste of her old home  she enjoys not paying for food  theres something else  apparently the word is going round london that evelyn napier  has given up any thought of mary  that hes going to marry one of the semphill girls  she writes as if somehow it reflects badly on mary  your dear sister is always such a harbinger of joy no  as if  as if mary had somehow been found wanting in her character  well i dont believe mr napier would have said that  neither do i really but  she ought to be married  talk to her  she never listens to me  if she did shed marry matthew  what about anthony strallan  anthony strallan is at least my age and as dull as paint  i doubt shed want to sit next to him at dinner let alone marry him  she has to marry someone robert  and if this is whats being said in london she has to marry soon  you shouldnt do that in here  i dont like being in the pantry all alone  mr carson wont mind hes gone into the village  hell mind if i tell him  thats pretty do you think so  she wants it put onto a new shirt  but its a bit oldfashioned to my taste oh no its lovely  have you recovered daisy  what from she had a bit of a turn  when we were in lady marys room  im fine thank you what sort of a turn  did you see a ghost leave her if she doesnt want to talk about it  ive often wondered if this place is haunted it ought to be  by the spirits of maids and footmen who died in slavery  but not in thomass case from over work  come on daisy what was it  i dont know i was thinking  first we had the titanic  dont keep harping back to that  i know it was a while ago but we knew em  i think of how i laid the fires for mr patrick  but he drowned in them icy waters oh for gods sake  and then theres the turkish gentleman  it just seems theres been too much death in the house  whats that got to do with lady marys bedroom  nothing nothing at all  afternoon maam  when do you put that magnificent display of prizes on show  not till the day itself  i remember a superb cup from last year  the grantham cup it was donated by the late lord grantham  for the best bloom in the village and who won it  i did  well done  and the year before  her ladyship won that one too  heavens how thrilling  and before that  youve met my father  good afternoon mr molesley what are you showing this year  oh this and that  only the finest roses in the village really  what an achievement  its a wonderful area for roses  were very lucky  well see some beautiful examples across the show  wont we mr molesley  if you say so your ladyship  whats up with you  nothing  his lordship blames mr napier for spreading gossip about lady mary  but it was you wasnt it why do you say that  because napier wasnt in on it  only four people know he was in her room that night  you me lady mary and possibly daisy  and i havent said nothing to nobody  i didnt tell about pamuk i just wrote  that lady mary was no better than she ought to be  who did you write it to a friend of mine valet to lord savident  you know what they say about old savident  not so much an open mind as an open mouth no wonder its round london  you wont tell will you im in enough trouble as it is  why whats happened  mr bates saw me nicking a bottle of wine  has he told mr carson not yet  but he will when hes feeling spiteful  i wish we could be shot of him then think of something quick  turn the tables on him before he has the chance to nail you  i thought you went to bed hours ago i was writing a note for lynch  i need the governess cart tomorrow  oh im going to malton  oh dont risk the traffic in malton  not now every tom dick and harry seems to have a motor  hardly last time there were five cars parked in the market place  and another three drove past while i was waiting  get branson to take you in the car neither of us are using it  i thought id pop in on old mrs stuart  will you tell mama if i forget  youre late this morning  the library grate needed a real going over  are any of them down yet  lady sybils in the dining room ill start with her room then  daisy  you know when you were talking about the feeling of death in the house  i was just being silly  i found myself wondering about the connection  between the poor turkish gentleman mr pamuk and lady marys room  only you were saying how you felt so uncomfortable in there  well ive  ive got to get on im late enough as it is  hello  is everything all right oh hello  i am about to send a telegram oh  papas sister is always nagging him to send supplies to london  and then we cable her so her butler can be at kings cross to meet them  its idiotic really is this lady rosamond painswick  you have done your homework  she wrote to welcome me into the family  which i thought pretty generous given the circumstances  its easy to be generous when you have nothing to lose  so are you doing any more church visiting with edith  my mothers trying to set something up  well watch out i think she has big plans for you  then shes in for an equally big disappointment  is it all right to do the fire  why are you so late i went back to my room  after id woken everyone and i just shut my eyes for a moment  ive been trying to catch up ever since  have you had any breakfast not a crumb  here  you cant take her biscuits  she never eats them none of them do  theyre just thrown away and changed every evening thanks  she wont mind anyway shes nice lady sybil  ugh  gwen  may i ask why you are sitting on lady sybils bed  well you see i had a turn  like a burst of sickness just sudden like  i had to sit down its true  youd better go and lie down i will tell mrs hughes  i dont need to interrupt her morning  im sure ill be fine if i could just put my feet up  and how many bedrooms have you still got to do just one lady ediths  and you can manage on your own  well shes no use to man or beast in that state go on  shoo  daisy may i ask why you are holding lady sybils biscuit jar  i was just polishing it before i put it back  see that you do  im sorry milady but i cant do more than my best  is there some difficulty your ladyship  dear mrs hughes as you know were giving a dinner on friday  for sir anthony strallan yes milady  it seems he is particularly fond of a new pudding  its called apple charlotte do you know it  im not sure  his sister mrs chetwood sent me the receipt  im trying to persuade mrs patmore to make it  and im trying to persuade her ladyship  that i have planned the dinner with her and i cant change it now  why not because everythings been ordered and prepared  well theres nothing here that looks very complicated  apples lemons butter  i cannot work from a new receipt at a moments notice  but i can read it to you if thats the problem  problem who mentioned a problem  how dare you say such a thing in front of her ladyship  very well well try it another time when youve had longer to prepare  well stay with the raspberry meringue  and very nice itll be too  im sure  have you taken leave of your senses  im so sorry about that milady  never mind i was asking a lot  do look after that girl  daisy shes used to it shell be all right  i wonder mrs patmore looks ready to eat her alive  i was only trying to help  like judas was only trying to help i suppose  when he brought the roman soldiers to the garden  i had to let the skirt down a little but i can put it back  no its yours  what will happen if one of the maids finds your room empty  itd only be anna and she wouldnt give me away  shes like a sister shed never betray me  then shes not like my sisters  walk on  shall i give you a hand  ah would you it takes half the time with two  i always feel a bit sorry for lady edith  me too although i dont know why  when you think what shes got and we havent  mrs hughes said she was after the other heir mr patrick crawley  the one who drowned that was different  she was in love with him  what happened she never got a lookin  he was all set up to marry lady mary  then hes a braver man than i am gunga din  sad to think about  its always sad when you love someone who doesnt love you back  no matter who you are  no i mean its sad that he died  oh  yes  very sad  he was nice  well thank you for that  much appreciated my pleasure  perhaps mr patrick did love her back he just couldnt say  why ever not  sometimes were not at liberty to speak  sometimes it wouldnt be right  take a seat  the flower show  oh i thought i was in for another telling off about the hospital  no this time its the flower show  ive been to see old mr molesleys garden  and his roses are the most beautiful ive ever laid eyes on  go on  you may not know it but i believe the committee feel obliged  to give you the cup for the best bloom as a kind of local tradition  no no i do not know that  i thought i usually won the prize for best bloom in the village  because my gardener had grown the best bloom in the village  yes but you dont usually win do you  you always win  yes i have been very fortunate in that regard  but surely when mr molesleys garden is so remarkable  and he is so very proud of his roses   you talk of mr molesleys pride  what about my gardeners pride  is he to be sacrificed on the altar of molesleys ambition  all im asking is that you release them  from any obligation to let you win  why not just tell them to choose whichever flower is best  but that is precisely what they already know  and do  im sorry milord i didnt think youd be in here  are my eyes deceiving me or is one of these missing  i dont know them well enough  no why would you  but theres a very pretty little blue one  with a miniature framed in french paste  it was made for a german prince i forget who  unless its been moved for some reason  but why would it be  can you help i shall be so grateful  our horse has cast a shoe is there a smithy nearby  aye you can try old crump in the next village  thank you  you see helps at hand  at least it happened on the way home  well theyll be worried about you  and if they check on me im finished  is her ladyship wearing that now  this is for friday night  i thought id give it a press while i had time  do you know whats happened to lady sybil  the others changes are ready but theres no sign of her  dont you start ive had her majesty on at me all afternoon  mr carson says hell fetch the police if shes not back soon  sorry miss but mr crumps staying over at the skelton estate tonight  hes working there all week is there anyone else  not that i know of  come on dragon come on  dragon if you dont move now ill have you boiled for glue  what if shes overturned  what if shes lying in a ditch somewhere  im sure shell be back in the shake of a lambs tail  the truth is theyre all getting too old for a mothers control  theyre growing up theyve grown up  they need their own establishments  im sure theyll get plenty of offers  noone ever warns you about bringing up daughters  you think its going to be like little women  instead theyre at each others throats from dawn till dusk  you look done in  ill bring you some food up later when weve finished dinner  where were you  you came up then  of course i did i had to change for the afternoon  did you cover for me what do you think  i dont suppose this had anything to do with lady sybil  oh anna it was a nightmare  i dont know how i got in without being seen  im sure i left a trail of mud up the stairs  sodid you get the job  well well have to wait and see  sorry to bother you milady  but your mother wanted you to know lady sybils back  shes changing now so dinner wont be late after all what happened  the horse went lame  is there anything else  there is something thats been troubling me  you remember the turkish gentleman mr pamuk  the one who died all sudden like  of course i remember well  its daisy milady  the kitchen maid  only shes been talking recently  as if she had ideas about mr pamuks death  what sort of ideas  well ive no proof and maybe im wrong  but ive a sense she knows something but wont say what  something involving lady mary  well how absurd  what could she know  whatever it is she wont say not to us anyway  have you spoken to lady mary about this  i didnt like to milady  it seemed impertinent somehow  but i thought someone in the family ought to know about it  quite right  bring the girl to my room tomorrow after breakfast  what did she want  nothing  just a message from mama to say that sybil had turned up alive  poor darling  she had to walk for miles  i dont think id have got down however lame the horse  no  i dont believe you would  i couldnt say milady  i dont know what miss obrien means  i didnt see nothing  well not much  obrien i wonder if you might leave us  nowits daisy isnt it  yes milady  im sure you see obrien only acted as she did because she is concerned  i suppose so milady  she seems to think that you are in possession of some knowledge  that is uncomfortable for you  because if that is the case then i dont think it fair on you  why should you be burdened with marys secret  my dear my heart goes out to you it really does  oh there there  youve been carrying too heavy a burden for too long  just tell me  and i promise youll feel better  you seem well prepared  theyll add a few more flowers before we open in the morning  but i think were nearly there  do look at mr molesleys display  hes worked so hard  theyre rather marvellous arent they  lovely  well done mr molesley thank you milady  i think everyone is to be congratulated  its splendid  but do look at these roses have you ever seen the like  my dear mrs crawley believes i am profiting from an unfair advantage  oh  she feels in the past i have been given the cup  merely as a matter of routine rather than merit  rather ungallant mother im sure when we see cousin violets roses  it will be hard to think they could be bettered  hard but not impossible  you are quite wonderful  the way you see room for improvement wherever you look  i never knew such reforming zeal  i take that as a compliment  i must have said it wrong  poor granny shes not used to being challenged  nor is mother i think we should let them settle it between them  so are you interested in flowers  im interested in the village  in fact im on my way to inspect the cottages  you know what all work and no play did for jack  but you think im a dull boy anyway dont you  i play too im coming up for dinner tonight  i suspect im there to balance the numbers  is it in aid of anything  not that i know of  just a couple of dreary neighbours thats all  maybe ill shine by comparison  mary were going  maybe you will  might i have a word  i want to say something before i ring the gong  im afraid its not very pleasant  his lordship is missing a very valuable snuff box  it appears to have been taken from the case in his room  if one of you knows anything about this  will he or she please come to me  your words will be heard in the strictest confidence  thank you  i am sorry mr bates  what an unpleasant thing to have happened  why are you picking on him  because hes the only one of us who goes in there  but dont worry im sure itll turn up  thank you for your concern  i hate this kind of thing  i hope to god they find it  better get a move on  im coming  does this brooch work  i cant decide its charming  oh dear is it another scolding  of course not youre too grown up to scold these days  heavens  then its really serious  id like you to look after sir anthony strallan tonight  hes a nice decent man  his position may not be quite like papas  but it would still make you a force for good in the county  mama not again how many times am i to be ordered  to marry the man sitting next to me at dinner  as many times as it takes  i turned down matthew crawley  is it likely id marry strallan when i wouldnt marry him  i am glad youve come to think more highly of cousin matthew  thats not the point no  the point is when you refused matthew  you were the daughter of an earl with an unsullied reputation  now you are damaged goods  mama  somehow there is a rumour in london that you are not virtuous  what does papa know about this  he knows it and he dismisses it  because unlike you and me he does not know that it is true  lets hope its just unkind gossip  because if anyone heard about  kemal  my lover kemal pamuk  exactly  if it gets around and youre not already married  every door in london will be slammed in your face  mama the world is changing  not that much  and not fast enough for you  i know you mean to help  i know you love me  but i also know what im capable of  and forty years of boredom and duty just isnt possible for me  im sorry  i do love you  and i want to help  im a lost cause mama  leave me to manage my own affairs  why not concentrate on edith  she needs all the help she can get  you mustnt be unkind to edith she has fewer advantages than you  fewer  she has none at all  open the oven  whats happened its that bloomin daisy  ive said shell be the death of me and now my words come true  come and sit down get away  get back to the stables  whatll you serve now them of course  i havent got anything else  daisy give us a hand get that cloth  whats the matter with that are you sure  shouldnt we tell certainly not  is the remove ready to go up  daisy give him a hand with the vegetables  theyre up in the servery in the warmer  im glad i dont have to eat them what the eye cant see  the heart wont grieve over  theres no doubt about it  the next few years in farming are going to be about mechanisation  thats the test and were going to have to meet it  dont you agree lady mary  yes of course sir anthony  im sure i do  are we ever going to be allowed to turn  sir anthony it must be so hard to meet the challenge of the future  and yet be fair to your employees  that is the point precisely  we cant fight progress but we must find ways to soften the blow  i should love to see one of the new harvesters  if you would ever let me  we dont have one here  i shall be delighted  i hope they find that snuff box  what happens if they dont  theyll organise a search wont they i wouldnt be mr bates  not for all the tea in china wouldnt you thomas  i dare say he feels just the same about you  whats the matter with you nothing  just a minute  i dont like to put it on earlier  it sinks in and spoils the effect  mama has released me thank god  sir anthony seems nice enough  if you want to talk farming and foxes by the hour  im rather looking forward to the flower show tomorrow  where mr molesleys roses will turn everybodys heads  but if you tell granny i said so ill denounce you as a liar  i wouldnt dare  ill leave that to my fearless mother  how are the cottages coming on wonderfully id love to show you  obviously its an act of faith at this stage  yes  good god  what on earth i do apologise lady grantham  but i had a mouthful of salt what  everyone put down your forks  carson remove this  bring fruit bring cheese bring anything to take this taste away  sir anthony i am so sorry  fains i be mrs patmores kitchen maid when the news gets out  poor girl we ought to send in a rescue party  you must think us very disorganised  no not at all these things happen  hey come on  its not that bad  nobodys died  i dont understand it  it must have been that daisy  shes muddled everything up before now but i never   dont worry daisy youre not in the line of fire  i know that pudding i chose it cos i know it  which is why you wouldnt let her ladyship have the pudding she wanted  because you didnt know it  exactly  i dont see how it happened  come on everyone lets give mrs patmore some room to breathe  you too  i dont think i should leave her mr carson knows what hes doing  dont do that  get william or the hall boy to do it its beneath your dignity  it wont kill me  now  all in your own good time  i think youve got something to tell me  havent you  i think i know where that snuff box is  where  hidden in your room  you dont think  of course i dont  you silly beggar  then  i bet thomas would like it if they took you for a thief  yes i expect he would  go upstairs now and find it  and when you have you can choose whether to put it in thomass room  or give it to me and ill slip it into miss obriens  you naughty girl  fight fire with fire thats what my mum says  poor mrs patmore do you think you should go down and see her  tomorrow she needs time to recover her nerves  i knew there was something going on  it seems hard that poor sir anthony had to pay the price  good god  as for you giggling like a schoolgirl with cousin matthew  it was pathetic  poor edith im sorry cousin matthew proved a disappointment to you  who says he has  matthew  he told me  oh sorry wasnt i supposed to know  you were very helpful edith looking after sir anthony  you saved the day  i enjoyed it  we seemed to have a lot to talk about  spare me your boasting please  now whos jealous jealous  do you think i couldnt have him if i wanted him  even you cant take every prize  is that a challenge if you like  i could almost manage for a long time  knowing the kitchen and where everything was kept  even with that fool girl  i think you might owe daisy an apology  maybe  ive had a lot to put up with i can tell you  and youve not been to a doctor  i dont need a doctor to tell me im going blind  a blind cook mr carson  what a joke  whoever heard of such a thing  a blind cook  i hope our salty pudding didnt spoil the evening for you  on the contrary  im glad you and mary are getting along  theres no reason you cant be friends no reason at all  i dont suppose theres any chance that you could sort of start again  life is full of surprises  ah ive been waiting for you  ive found a book and its just the thing to catch your interest  oh really im intrigued what could it be  well i was looking in the library and i  i was very taken by what you were saying over dinner about the   youre so right lady mary how clever you are  this is exactly what we have to be aware of  theres a section here i was rather unsure about i wonder if you  it seems we have both been thrown over for a bigger prize  heavens is that the time  youre not going the truth is my heads splitting  i dont want to spoil the party so ill slip away  would you make my excuses to your parents  excuse me sir anthony  has mr crawley left yes milady  but what about the car branson cant have brought it round so quickly  he said hed rather walk milady  thank you  mary can be such a child  what do you mean darling  she thinks if you put a toy down  itll still be sitting there when you want to play with it again  what are you talking about  never mind  mr carson  we were wondering about that snuff box  has it turned up yet im afraid not  well i think we should have a search  what it doesnt do to leave these things too long  mr carson can search the mens rooms mrs hughes the womens  and it should be right away now weve talked of it  so noone has a chance to hide the box  dont you agree mr carson  well perhaps its for the best  although im sure i wont find anything  ill fetch mrs hughes  i think ill just um id better check its tidy  the bastards hidden it in my room or yours  why did i ever listen to you in the first place  miss obrien  my my you have been busy  i was expecting you later than this  ill tell molesley to lock up thanks  good night mother  how was your evening did you enjoy yourself  quite  the thing is just for a moment i thought   never mind what i thought i was wrong  good night  my word molesley splendid roses well done thank you your lordship  all the stalls are set out very well this year  this is enchanting  do we grow this i doubt if youve got that one your ladyship  ive only just found it myself  is it a secret or could you tell mr brocket  id be glad to milady  he should come and see the rose garden he could give us some ideas  old molseleys a champion  or he would be in a fairer world  dont you start  im afraid ive been annoying cousin violet on that score  if molesley deserves the first prize for his flowers  the judges will give it to him  they wouldnt dare really robert you make me so annoyed  isnt it possible i should win the thing on merit  i think the appropriate answer to that mama is yes dear  i dont know why were bothering  well have missed the speeches as it is  dont be such a grouch  you should have punished one of them at least  they know that i know thats worth something  what do you think will happen to mrs patmore  shell muddle through with daisy for help  in the long term well have to wait for the doctor to give his opinion  i hope theres something they can do  i hope so too  but if there isnt i hope they tell her there isnt  nothing is harder to live with than false hope  i wish youd just come out with it  with what  whatever it is youre keeping secret  i cant  you dont deny it then  no i dont deny it  and i dont deny youve a right to ask  but i cant  im not a free man  are you trying to tell me that youre married  i have been married yes but thats not all of it  because  because i love you mr bates  i know its not ladylike to say it  but im not a lady and i dont pretend to be  you are a lady to me  and i never knew a finer one  if you want a lift i can take one of you but not more  one of the women  no you must go then we can all hurry and meet you there  yes all right  i mustnt slow you down  theres been too much of that already  have you recovered from our ordeal  i got a letter this morning  they must have written it as soon as i left the office  they are pleased to have met me  but i do not quite fit their requirements  so it was all for nothing i dont agree  only a fool doesnt know when theyve been beaten  then im a fool for im a long way from being beaten yet  and now  when you ran off last night i hope you hadnt thought me rude  certainly not i monopolised you at dinner  i had no right to any more of your time  you see edith and i had this sort of bet  please dont apologise  i had a lovely evening and im glad were on speaking terms  now i should look after my mother  why was cousin matthew in such a hurry to get away  dont be stupid  i suppose you didnt want him when he wanted you  and now its the other way round  you have to admit its quite funny  ill admit that if i ever wanted to attract a man  id steer clear of those clothes and that hat  you think yourself so superior dont you  ugh  well i think she who laughs last laughs longest  did that missing box of yours ever turn up  it was a fuss about nothing  they must have put it back on the wrong shelf dusting  bates found it this morning  next time have a proper look before you start complaining  im sure the servants were frightened half to death  mea culpa  and now the grantham cup for the best bloom in the village  and the grantham cup is awarded to  mr william molesley  for his comptesse cabarousse rose  bravo well done  bravo  congratulations mr molesley  thank you milady  thank you for letting me have it  it is the judges who decide these things not me  but very well done  congratulations  bravo mama  that must have been a real sacrifice and bravely borne  i dont know what everyones on about  but i all is well my dear  all is well  but you agree with everything he says i do my dear  we should see more of each other  i cant listen to your attempts to try and justify yourself  but if you expect me to disown my daughter  i cant no i was hoping that lady edith might like to accompany me  dont play with me  i took her to ripon for the count
