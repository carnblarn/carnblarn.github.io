morning my lord   is it true what they say  i believe so my lord  im afraid well know some people on it  i dont suppose there are any lists of survivors yet  i understand most of the ladies were taken off in time  you mean the ladies in first class  god help the poor devils below decks  on their way to a better life  what a tragedy  when anna told me i thought she must have dreamt it   do we know anyone on board  your mother knows the astors  at least she knows him we dined with lady rothes last month  there are bound to be others  i thought it was supposed to be unsinkable  every mountain is unclimbable until someone climbs it  so every ship is unsinkable until it sinks   good morning papa  morning   whats that  just arrived telegram   is her ladyship awake  yes my lord  im just taking in her breakfast  thank you   hello  may i come in  isnt this terrible  when you think how excited lucy rothes was at the prospect  its too awful for any words  did jj astor get off  course his new wife is bound to have been rescued  ive had a telegram from george murray  one of his partners is in new york  yes  it seems james and patrick were on board  what  but they werent going over till may  then they changed their plans definitely theyre on the passenger list  thank you obrien thatll be all for the moment  butsurely they were picked up   doesnt look like it  what  neither of them  you must tell mary  she cant hear about it from anyone else  neither were picked up thats what he said   mr crawley and mr patrick  thats what he said  her ladyship was the colour of this cloth  well its a terrible shame if its true  its worse than a shame its a complication   what do you mean  what do you think  mr crawley was his lordships cousin and heir to the title  i thought lady mary was the heir  shes a girl stupid girls cant inherit  but now mr crawleys dead and mr patrick was his only son   so what happens next  its a dreadful thing  hello  ive been waiting at the back door  i knocked but noone came  so you pushed in  im john bates the new valet  the new valet thats right   youre early  came on the milk train  thought id get to know the place start tonight  im anna the head housemaid  how do you do  and im miss obrien her ladyships maid  youd better come along with us  but how can you manage  dont worry about that i can manage  because weve all got our own work to do   i can manage  all right mrs hughes  ill take over thank you  good morning mr bates  welcome  i hope your journey was satisfactory   it was fine thank you  i am the butler at downton   my name is carson  how do you do mr carson  this is thomas first footman  hes been looking after his lordship since mr watson left  itll be a relief to get back to normal wont it thomas  i assume that everything is ready for mr batess arrival  ive put him in mr watsons old room  though he left it in quite a state i can tell you  but what about all them stairs  i keep telling you i can manage  of course you can  thomas take mr bates to his room and  show him where hell be working  thank you everyone  well i cant see that lasting long  thank you miss obrien  oh yes  i shall be comfortable here  does this mean ill have to go into full mourning  my first cousin and his son  are almost certainly dead  we will all be in mourning  no i mean with the other thing  after all it wasnt official  if youre saying you do not wish to mourn patrick as a fiance   that is up to you  well noone knew about it outside the family   i repeat it is up to you  well thats a relief  theres some cedarlined cupboards in the attic  for things that arent often worn travelling clothes and such  mr watson used them to rotate the summer and winter stuff  ill show you later  what about studs and links  do i choose them or does he  lay them out unless he asks for something in particular  these for a ball these for an ordinary dinner  these only in london   ill get the hang of it  yeah youll have to  snuff boxes he collects them  beautiful  funny our job isnt it  what do you mean  the way we live with all this  a pirates hoard within our reach  but none of its ours is it  no none of its ours  i cant believe ive been passed over for long john silver  you should have spoken up when you had the chance  dont make the same mistake next time  who says therell be a next time  is this a public holiday noones told me of  she was certainly reluctant to go into mourning  well shell have to we all will  obriens sorting out my black now  and ive told anna to see what the girls have that still fits  of course this alters everything  you wont try to deny it  you must challenge the entail now surely  cant we at least wait until we know  theyre dead before we discuss it  dont talk as if im not brokenhearted because i am  of course i have never understood why this estate must go  to whomever inherits your title  my dear i dont make the law  what is it  the dowager countess is in the drawing room   ill come now  she asked for lady grantham  i wonder what ive done wrong this time  and the new valet has arrived my lord  has he hm thank you carson  what is it  im not entirely sure that he will prove equal to the task  but your lordship will be the judge of that  id better go  tell her about james and patrick  she wont have heard  of course ive heard why else would i be here  robert didnt want you to read about it in a newspaper and be upset  he flatters me  im tougher than i look  im very sorry about poor patrick of course  he was a nice boy  we were all so fond of him  but i never cared for james  he was too like his mother and a nastier woman never drew breath   will you stay for some luncheon  thank you   ill let carson know  ive already told him  shall we sit down   do you know the new heir  only that there is one  hes roberts third cousin once removed  i have never to my knowledge set eyes on him  of course if your late husband hadnt forced me  to sign that absurd act of legal theft  my dear i didnt come here to fight  lord grantham wanted to protect the estate  it never occurred to him that you wouldnt have a son  well i didnt  no you did not  but when patrick had married mary  and your grandson been hailed as master  honour would have been satisfied  unfortunately now  now a complete unknown has the right to pocket my money  along with the rest of the swag  the problem is saving your dowry would break up the estate  it would be the ruin of everything roberts given his life to   and he knows this  well if he doesnt he will  then theres no answer  yes there is and its a simple one  the entail must be smashed  in its entirety  and mary recognised as heiress of all  theres nothing we can do about the title  no she cant have the title  but she can have your money  and the estate  i didnt run downton for 30 years  to see it go lock stock and barrel  to a stranger from god knows where  are we to be friends then  we are allies my dear  which can be a good deal more effective  downton is a great house mr bates  and the crawleys are a great family  we live by certain standards  and those standards can at first seem daunting  of course  if you find yourself tonguetied in the presence of his lordship  i can only assure you that his manners and grace  will soon help you to perform your duties to the best of your ability  i know  bates my dear fellow  i do apologise i should have realised youd all be at luncheon   not at all my lord  please sit sit everyone  i just want to say a quick hello to my old comradeinarms  bates my dear man welcome to downton  thank you sir  im so sorry to have disturbed you all please forgive me  you never asked  thomas take that up  leave it daisy hes a grown man  i suppose he can lift a meat pie  now put that apple tart in the lower oven  oh and take that away  mr lynch shouldnt have left it there   what is it  salt of sorrel  i asked him for some to clean the brass pots  so put it somewhere careful its poison  it seems like a lot of food  when you think theyre all in mourning  nothing makes you hungrier or more tired than grief  when my sister died god rest her soul  i ate my way through four platefuls of sandwiches at one sitting   and slept round the clock  did it make you feel better  not much but it passed the time  oh my lord what was this chopped egg supposed to be sprinkled on   was it the chicken  it was take it upstairs now   i cant go in the dining room  i should think not  find thomas or william and tell them what to do  for heavens sake get a move on before they get back from church  well weve given them a memorial in london and a memorial here  i prefer memorials to funerals theyre less dispiriting  we could hardly have held a funeral without the bodies  i gather theyre putting up a stone  to mark those whose bodies were never found  in fact i hear the canadians are making quite a thing  of the titanic cemetery im surprised at the number they found  youd think the sea would have taken more of them  so murray what have you to tell me about the lucky mr crawley  nothing too terrible i hope  ive only made a few enquiries but no theres not much to alarm you  matthew crawley is a solicitor based in manchester  manchester  his special field is company law  his mother is alive and he lives with her  his father obviously is not he was a doctor  i know  it does seem odd that my third cousin should be a doctor  there are worse professions  indeed  do me a favour this must be sprinkled on the chicken   isnt there more to go up  please it wont take a moment  go on then give it here  we ought to talk about the business of the entail  as you know on your death the heir to the title inherits everything  except for the sums set aside for your daughters and your widow  yes  owing to the terms of her settlement  this will include the bulk of your wifes fortune  it has been our sole topic of conversation  since the day the ship went down  of course it must seem horribly unjust to lady grantham  but that is how the law stands  is there really no way to detach her money from the estate  even to me it seems absurd  your father tied the knots pretty tight id say its unbreakable  i see  really edith  do you have to put on such an exhibition  shes not  i was supposed to be engaged to him for heavens sake not you  and i can control myself  then you should be ashamed  dont tell me youve not sent up the egg yet  oh god help me please god help me  what on earths the matter  run upstairs to the dining room   and find william i beg you  i cant do it now  youve got to ill be hanged if you dont   what  daisy is that you  is it the chicken in a sauce or the chicken with sliced oranges  oh thank you blessed and merciful lord thank you  its the chicken in the sauce  ill never do anything sinful again i swear it not till i die  mr murray how lovely to see you do come in  youre very kind lady grantham but i must get back to london   but youll stay for luncheon  thank you but no  ill eat on the train  in fact if youd be so good as to ask for the motor to be brought round  but didnt you want the afternoon to talk things through  i think weve said everything we have to say havent we my lord  for the time being yes thank you murray  its given me a good deal to think about  mary try to get everyone into the dining room  edith make sure old lord minterne sits down   theyve all gone  they have thank the lord   what about the lawyer  he was the first away  didnt even stay for the luncheon  i wish theyd make their minds up  gwens put clean sheets on the blue room bed  now shell just have to strip it again  cant you leave it for the next guest  well only if you dont tell  so has it all been settled  no i dont know if anythings been settled  theres a fellow in manchester with claims to the title i gather  but its all a long way from settled  you mustnt take it personally  oh i do take it personally mrs hughes  i cant stand by and watch our family  threatened with the loss of all they hold dear  theyre not our family  well theyre all the family ive got  i beg your pardon  do you ever wish youd gone another way  worked in a shop or a factory  had a wife and children  do you  i dont know  maybe sometimes  williams laid tea in the library but her ladyship hasnt come down  shell be tired take a tray up to her bedroom   is thomas back  not yet mr carson  he asked if he could run down the village i didnt see why not  its iniquitous  they cant expect you to sit by silent  as your fortune is stolen away   cant they  his lordshipd never let it happen  hows bates working out  well  i dont like to say  only it seems unkind to criticise a man for an affliction my lady  even if it means he cant do his job  how are you settling in  very welli think  unless your lordship feels differently  no complaints  if i had any i should take them to mr carson my lord not you  youre probably right  and the house hasnt worn you out with the endless stairs and so on  i like the house my lord i like it as a place to work   what happened  its only the old wound  after i left the army i had a spot of bother  and just when id got through that about a year ago  my knee started playing up  a bit of shrapnel got left in or something and it moved  but its fine its not a problem  and youd let me know if you felt it was all too much for you  i would but it wont be  thomas   and where have you been  the village  to send a telegram if you must know  oh pardon me for living  well murray didnt stay long  does her ladyship know how they left it  no they talked it all through on the way back from the church  if i was still his valet id get it out of him  bates wont say a word  he will not  id bet you a tanner hes a spy in the other direction  i wanted that job  we were all right together his lordship and me  then be sure to get your foot in the door when bates is gone  we cant get rid of him just because he talks behind our backs  theres more than one way to skin a cat  perhaps she misunderstood  no it was quite plain  obrien told her bates cant do the job properly   why was he taken on  oh he was lord granthams batman  when he was fighting the boers  i know that but even so   i think its romantic  i dont  how can a valet do his work if hes lame  hes not very lame  there  anything else before i go down  no thats it thank you  oh i hate black  its not for long  ma says we can go into halfmourning next month   and to colours by september  still a lot for a cousin  but not a fiance  he wasnt really a fiance  no  i thought that was what you call a man youre going to marry  i was only going to marry him if nothing better turned up  mary what a horrid thing to say  dont worry edith would have taken him wouldnt you  yes id have taken him  if youd given me the chance id have taken him like a shot  i just think you should know its not working mr carson  do you mean mr bates is lazy  not lazy exactly but he just cant carry  he can hardly manage his lordships cases  you saw how it was when they went up to london for de memorial  he cant help with the guests luggage  and as for waiting at table forget that   and what do you want me to do  its not for me to say  but is it fair on william to have all the extra work  i dont believe youd like to think  the house was falling below the way things ought to be   i would not  thats all im saying  im going down coming  in a moment you go  i know youre sad about patrick whatever you say i know it  youre a darling  but you see im not as sad as i should be  and thats what makes me sad  thank you   ill do that  no no thank you my lord   i can do it  im sure  i hope so my lord i hope you are sure  bates we have to be sensible  i wont be doing you a favour in the long run if its too much for you   whatever weve been through it has to work  of course sir  i mean my lord   do you miss the army bates  i miss a lot of things  but you have to keep moving dont you  ha you do indeed  ill show you my lord i promise i wont let you down  weve managed so far havent we  yes we have of course we have   you look very nice  thank you darling   did murray make matters clearer  yes im afraid he did  by the way obrien says bates is causing a lot of awkwardness downstairs   you may have to do something about it  shes always making trouble  is that fair when she hasnt mentioned it before now  i dont know why you listen to her  it is quite eccentric even for you to have a crippled valet  please dont use that word  did he tell you he couldnt walk when he made his application  dont exaggerate  doesnt it strike you as dishonest not to mention it   i knew hed been wounded  you never said  you know i dont care to talk about all that  of course i understand what it must be like  to have fought alongside someone in a war   oh you understand that do you  certainly i do  you must form the most tremendous bonds  even with a servant  really even with a servant  oh robert dont catch me out  im simply saying i fully see why you want to help him  but  butis this the right way to employ him for a job he cant do  is it any wonder if the others noses are put out  i just want to give him a chance  mama im sorry noone told me you were here  oh dear such a glare  i feel as if i were on stage at the gaiety  were used to it  i wish youd let me install it in the dower house its so convenient  the man who manages the generator could look after yours as well  no i couldnt have electricity in the house  i wouldnt sleep a wink  all those vapours  even cora wont have it in the bedrooms  she did wonder about the kitchens but i couldnt see the point  before anyone joins us im glad of this chance for a little talk   i gather murray was here today  news travels fast  yes i saw him and hes not optimistic  that theres anything we can do  i refuse to believe it  be that as it may its a fact  but to lose coras fortune  really mama you know as well as i do  that coras fortune is not coras fortune any more  thanks to papa it is now part of the estate  and the estate is entailed to my heir  that is it that is all of it  robert dear i dont mean to sound harsh  you may not mean to but i bet you will  against my wishes for her money  give it away now and what was the point of your peculiar marriage in the first place  if i were to tell you shed made me happy   would that stretch belief  its not why you chose her  above all the other girls who could have filled my shoes so easily  if you must know when i think of my motives for pursuing cora  im ashamed  theres no need to remind me of them  dont you care about downton  what do you think  ive given my life to downton  i was born here and i hope to die here  i claim no career beyond the nurture of this house and the estate  it is my third parent and my fourth child  emotional do i care about it yes i do care  i hope i dont hear sounds of a disagreement  is that what they call discussion in new york  im glad youre fighting im glad somebodys putting up a fight  youre not really fighting granny are you and papa  your grandmother merely wishes to do the right thing and so do i  dinner is served my lady  does anyone else keep dreaming about the titanic  i cant get it out of my mind  not again give it a rest  daisy its time to let it go  but all them people  freezing to death in the midnight icy water  oh you sound like a penny dreadful  i expect you saw worse things in south africa eh mr bates  not worse but pretty bad  did you enjoy the war  i dont think anyone enjoys war but  there are some good memories too  im sure there are  mr bates could you hand me that tray   blast  ill do it  the ladies are out weve given them coffee  and his lordships taken his port to the library  anna gwen go up and help clear away  daisy tell mrs patmore well eat in 15 minutes  i keep forgetting does this go next door or back to the kitchen  those go back but the dessert service and all the glasses   stay in the upstairs pantry  put it on here  what is it  her ladyships told him she thinks mr bates ought to go  she said to me if only his lordship had been content with thomas  did she really   what are you doing up here  its a free country  well im going for my dinner  you two can stay hereplotting  so the young duke of crowborough is asking himself to stay  and we know why  you hope you know why  that is not at all the same  you realise the duke thinks marys prospects have altered   i suppose so  theres no suppose about it  of course this is exactly the sort of opportunity  that will come to mary  if we can only get things settled in her favour   is robert coming round  not yet  to him the risk is wed succeed in saving my money but not the estate  he feels hed be betraying his duty if downton were lost because of him   well ill write to murray  he wont say anything different  well we have to start somewhere  our duty is to mary  well give him a date for when marys out of mourning  noone wants to kiss a girl in black  oh do stop admiring yourself  hes not marrying you for your looks  thats if he wants to marry you at all  he will   i think you look beautiful  thank you sybil darling  we should go down  theyll be back from the station at any moment  lets not gild the lily dear and mary try and look surprised  are you all ready  very well we shall go out to greet them   and me mr carson  no daisy not you  can you manage mr bates or would you rather wait here  i want to go mr carson  theres no obligation for the whole staff to be present  id like to be there  well its certainly a great day for downton  to welcome a duke under our roof  help me with the luggage dont go running off   ill give you a hand  i couldnt ask that mr bates  not in your condition  how long do we have to put up with this mr carson just so i know  welcome to downton  lady grantham this is so kind of you  not at all duke  were delighted you could spare the time  you know my daughter mary of course   of course lady mary  and edith  but i dont believe youve met my youngest sybil   ah lady sybil  how do you do  come on in you must be worn out  oh lady grantham i have a confession to make  which i hope wont cause any bother  my man was taken ill just as i was leaving so i  oh well that wont be a problem will it carson  certainly not  i shall look after his grace myself  oh no i wouldnt dream of being such a nuisance  surely a footman  i remember this man  you served me when i dined with lady grantham in london   i did your grace  ah there we are  we shall do very well together wont we   thomas your grace  thomas  thomas good  i hope you had a pleasant journey  bates are you all right  perfectly my lord i apologise  mr bates  thats better  please dont feel sorry for me  what shall we do what would you like to do  i think id rather like to go exploring  certainly gardens or house  oh house i think  gardens are all the same to me  very well  we can begin in the hall   one of the oldest  no  not all those drawing rooms and libraries  well what then  i dont know the  the secret passages and the attics  it seems a bit odd butwhy not   ill just tell mama  no dont tell your mama   but theres nothing wrong in it  no indeed  im only worried the others will want to join us  marys settling him in  cora dont let mary make a fool of herself  by the way ill be going up to london next week  do you want to open the house  no no ill just take bates and stay at the club  i wont be more than a day or two  i see are things progressing  what things  its just a regimental dinner  it was a pity bates spoiled the arrival this afternoon  he didnt spoil anything he fell over  it was so undignified carson hates that kind of thing  i dont care what carson thinks  a message from the dowager countess my lady  she says she wont come to tea but shell join you for dinner  carson i hope you werent embarrassed this afternoon  i can assure you the duke very much appreciated his welcome  im glad   is bates all right  i think so my lord  it must be so difficult for you all the same  dont stare  do you realise this is the first time weve ever been alone  then youve forgotten when i pulled you into the conservatory at the northbrooks   how sad  no i havent  its not quite the same with 20 chaperones hiding behind every fern  and are you pleased to be alone with me my lady  oh dear if i answer truthfully youll think me rather forward  i dont think we should pry   it feels ratherdisrespectful  nonsense  its your fathers house isnt it  youve a right to know what goes on in it   where does this lead  to the mens quarters  with the lock on the womens side  only mrs hughes is allowed to turn it  mrs hughes  and you   in here  a footman i imagine   should you do that  why not  im making a study on the genus footman  i seek to know the creatures ways  someones coming   can i help you my lady  we were just exploring  you look for thomas your grace  no as lady mary said weve just been exploring  would you care to explore my room my lady  of course not bates im sorry to have bothered you  we were just going down  why did you apologise to that man its not his business what we do  i always apologise when im in the wrong its a habit of mine  the plain fact is mr bates through no fault of his own  is not able to fulfil the extra duties expected of him  he cant lift he cant serve at table  hes dropping things all over the place  on a night like tonight he should act as a third footman  as it is my lord  we may have to have a maid in the dining room  cheer up carson there are worse things happening in the world  not worse than a maid serving a duke  so youre quite determined  its a hard decision your lordship  a very hard decision  but the honour of downton is at stake  dont worry carson  i know all about hard decisions when it comes to the honour of downton  dont i boy  william you mustnt let thomas take advantage  hes only a footman same as you  its all right mrs hughes  i like to keep busy  takes your mind off things  what things have you got to take your mind off  if youre feeling homesick theres no shame in it  no  it means you come from a happy home  theres plenty of people here would envy that  yes mrs hughes   will that be all my lord  yes  that is not exactly  have you recovered from your fall this afternoon  im very sorry about that my lord  i dont know what happened  the thing is bates  i said i would give you a trial and i have  if it were only up to me  its this question of a valets extra duties  you mean waiting at table when theres a large party  that and carrying things and  you see that carson cant compromise the efficiency of his staff  i do my lord of course i do  might i make a suggestion  that when an extra footman is required  the cost could come out of my wages  absolutely not i cant allow that  because i am very eager to stay my lord  very eager indeed  i know you are  and i was eager that this should work  you see it is unlikely that i shall find another position  but in a smaller house where less is expected of you  its not likely  i mean to help until you find something  i couldnt take your money my lord  a take wages for a job done thats all  very good my lord  ill go at once  theres no need to rush out into the night  take the london train tomorrow it leaves at nine  youll have a months wages too that i insist on  its a bloody business bates but i cant see any way round it  i quite understand my lord  im afraid were rather a female party tonight duke  but you know what its like trying to balance numbers in the country  a single man outranks the holy grail  no im terribly flattered to be dining en famille  what were you and mary doing in the attics this afternoon  i expect mary was showing the duke the house werent you  are you a student of architecture  absolutely  then i do hope youll come and inspect my little cottage  it was designed by wren for the first earls sister   the attics  yes  mary took the duke up to the attics  whatever for  why was this dear  we were just looking around  looking around  what is there to look at but servants rooms   what was the real reason  dont be such a chatterbox edith  i think well go through   i still dont understand  will you hold your tongue  how long do you think theyll be im starving   have you settled the ladies  yes mr carson  then it wont be long once they go through  do you think hell speak out  do you think well have a duchess to wait on imagine that  you wont be waiting on her  there is no reason why the eldest daughter and heiress of the earl  should not wear a duchesss coronet with honour  heiress mr carson has it been decided  it will be if theres any justice in the world  well well know soon enough  what are you doing anna  i thought id take something up to mr bates  him not being well enough to come down  you dont mind do you mrs hughes  i dont mind not this once  no take him whatever he might need  mr bates is leaving without a stain on his character  i hope you all observe that in the manner of your parting  i dont see why he has to go  i dont mind doing extra  its not up to you  ill take care of his lordship shall i mr carson  not while youre looking after the duke you wont  ill see to his lordship myself  mr bates  are you there  i brought something up in case you were hungry  thats very kind  im ever so sorry youre going  ill be all right  of course you will  theres always a place for a man like you  oh yes  somethingll turn up  tell uswhen youre fixed  justdrop us a line  else ill worry  well we cant have that  we must go and let the servants get in here  id be grateful if we can stay a minute more  i have something to ask you  i was terribly sorry to hear about your cousins  you said  did you know them not well  i used to see patrick at the odd thing  i imagine it will mean some adjustments for you all  to lose two heirs in one night is terrible   indeed it was terrible  awful  but then again its an ill wind  at least lady marys prospects must have rather improved  have they  havent they  i will not be coy and pretend i do not understand your meaning  though you seem very informed on this familys private affairs  but you ought perhaps to know that i do not intend to fight the entail  not any part of it  you cant be serious  it pains me to say it but i am  youll give up your entire estate  your wifes money into the bargain to a perfect stranger  you wont even put up a fight  i hope he proves to be perfect but i rather doubt it  very odd thing to joke about  no odder than this conversation  so there you have it  but mary will still have her settlement  which you wont find ungenerous  iim sorry  i only meant that her portion  when she marries  will be more than respectable   youll be pleased i promise you  oh heavens  i hope i havent given the wrong impression   you know the  my dear lord grantham  dont my dear lord grantham me  you knew what you were doing when you came here  you encouraged mary all of us to think  forgive me but i came to express my sympathies and my friendship  nothing more  lady mary is a charming person  whoever marries her will be a lucky man  he will not however be me  i see and what was it that you asked me to stay behind to hear  i forget  arent you coming into the drawing room  iim tired i think ill just slip away  please make my excuses  im afraid ive worn you out   tomorrow we can just  im leaving in the morning  good night  oh you might tell that footman   thomas  thomas  you might tell him ive gone up  so he slipped the hook  at least im not fishing with no bait  i dont believe that  well believe what you like  he wont break the entail  the unknown cousin gets everything and  and marys inheritance will be the same as it always was  how was i to know when the lawyer  you werent to you did the right thing to telegraph me   its just not going to come off  so what now  well you you know how im fixed  i have to have an heiress  if it means going to new york to find one  what about me  youyou will wish me well  you said youd find me a job if i wanted to leave  and do you  i want to be a valet im sick of being a footman  thomas i dont need a valet  i thought you were getting rid of the new one here  ive done it but im not sure carsons  going to let me take over  i want to be with you  i just cant see it working can you  we dont have the basis of a servantmaster relationship do we   you came here to be with me  among other reasons  andone swallow doesnt make a summer  arent you forgetting something  what  are you threatening me  because of a youthful dalliance  a few weeks of madness in a london season  you wouldnt hold that against me surely  i would if i have to  and whod believe a greedy footman over the words of a duke  if youre not careful youll end up behind bars  ive got proof  do you mean these  you know my mothers always telling me never put anything in writing  and now thanks to you i never will again  how did you get them you bastard  no need to be a bad loser thomas  go to bed  unless you want to stay  i think ill turn in  no big announcement then  no nor likely to be hes off on the nine oclock train  he never is  and when weve had a turkey killed for tomorrows dinner   i wonder what she did wrong  she did nothing wrong  not from the way his lordship was talking  so his grace turned out to be graceless   good night mrs hughes  goodnight mr carson  if you knew that was your decision why put mary through it  but i didnt know it was my decision my final decision until tonight  but i find i cannot ruin the estate  or hollow out the title for the sake of mary  even with a better man than that  i try to understand i just cant  why should you downton is in my blood and in my bones its not in yours  and i can no more be the cause of its destruction  than i could betray my country  besides how was i to know he wouldnt take her without the money  dont pretend to be a child because it suits you  do you think she would have been happy with a fortune hunter  she might have been  i was  have you been happy  really have i made you happy  yes  that is since you fell in love with me  which if i remember correctly was about a year after we were married  not a year not as long as that  but it wouldnt have happened for mary  why not  because i am so much nicer than the duke of crowborough  ill be the judge of that  just dont think im going to let it rest robert  i havent given up by any means  i must do what my conscience tells me  and so must i  and i dont want you to think ill let it rest  my lord would it be acceptable for bates to ride in front with taylor  otherwise it means getting the other car out  he and his grace are catching the same train  perfectly acceptable  and if his grace doesnt like it he can lump it  youve been so kind lady grantham thank you  goodbye duke  youll make my farewells to your delightful daughters  theyd have been down if theyd known you are leave so soon  alas somethings come up which has taken me quite by surprise  obviously  well grantham this has been a highly enjoyable interlude  has it and i feared it had proved a disappointment  not at all not at all  my stay in your lovely house has driven away my cares  we ought to go my lord if his grace is to catch the train  goodbye bates and good luck  good luck to you my lord  wait  get out bates  i really mustnt be late  get back inside and well say no more about it  it wasnt right carson  i just didnt think it was right   first post maam  thank you ellen   one for you  oh thank you mother   its from lord grantham  really  what on earth does he want  he wants to change our lives  welcome to downton   why are you so against him  he isnt one of us  i stole im a thief you have my resignation  for once in your life will you please just listen  noone can foresee the future doctor  not you not i and certainly not mrs crawley  oh no youre far too busy and i wouldnt want to push in
