                 dawnton abbey season 2 episode 3  should we give them some more space between the beds  well we could give them not much  im determined to defend the library as a recreation room  where are we to sit we can screen off the small library  is that all i suppose or we could leave you the boudoir  i wanted to put the intermediaries in there but we dont have to  how kind  why will we only have officers surely all wounded men need to convalesce  the hospital is for officers the whole idea  is to have a complimentary convalescent home  of course but i dont know if we can make that an absolute rule  if the world were logical i would rather agree with you  which comes as no surprise  you would not i imagine  you imagine right  what these men will need is rest and relaxation  will that be achieved by mixing ranks and putting everyone on edge  granny  different ranks can relax together it has been known  well dont look at me im very good at mixing  we always danced the first waltz at the servants ball didnt we carson  it was an honour my lady its a lot to ask when people arent at their best  im searching for lady mary carson will you tell her im in the library  dont loiter edith theres plenty to be done  of course but im not quite sure  sybil i wanted to have a quick word  im going down to the village this afternoon if anyone wants anything  some stamps would be kind ill get you the money  id like to thank you all for your work this morning  its so strange to see the rooms converted into dormitories but good  it was wrong for our life to chug along as if  the war were only happening to other people  how will it be though are we all working for mrs crawley now  we are not  im sure the chain of command will be sorted out soon  or therell be blood on the stairs  thank you miss obrien  but what do you think it meant  really granny lavinia swire knows richard carlisle so what  one knows lots of people in london  i dont know many people whod threaten me behind the laurels  aunt rosamund said herself she didnt know what to make of it  i still think its a peculiar way for a gentleman to speak to a lady  at least you think him a gentleman  the point is do you think hes a gentleman  im not sure it matters much to me  well im going up to london to stay with rosamund for a day or two  i think well have lavinia for tea  you sound as if youre going to gobble her up  if only we could  but where are they going to eat  i understand from mrs crawley that theyll share the  dining room with the officers who are almost well  so am i running a canteen now  william says hes got time off between  the end of his training and going overseas  hell be with his father surely  hes going home first but wants to come here for his last night  you wouldnt mind that would you mr carson certainly not  id be glad to wish him well on his way  oh for you mr branson  why do you think hes coming here  to see us all and say goodbye whats wrong with that  but suppose its something more  suppose hes got plans  well you have to deal with that when it happens and mind you deal fair  now go and grate that suet before i grow old and die  who will be in charge  cousin isobel thinks itll be her  all i know is that shell drive us mad before the end  im going up to change i just want to finish this  arent you going to the hospital not yet  im on a night shift ill walk down after dinner  and please dont start lecturing me i wont  the truth is i envy you  do you ever miss helping out on the drakes farm  thats a funny question  why no reason  its just you seemed to have such a purpose there  it suited you  it did suit me  i enjoyed it but now i feel like a spare part  trust me  you have a talent that none of the rest of us have  just find out what it is and use it  its doing nothing thats the enemy  the truth is my lady mrs crawley has forgotten this is your house  and we need a friend in charge of the daytoday management  because if mrs crawley gets one of her toadies in to run things  shell have her nose in every pie before you can say jack robinson  but who  what about thomas my lady  hes hospital trained and hes always had a soft spot for downton  thomas the footman  managing downton abbey  but hes not a footman now is he  hes a corporal with real battle experience as a medic  could dr clarkson spare him  well  i suppose hell have to spare somebody  are you all right  you seem a bit preoccupied  i had a  no never mind  what  it was this afternoon in the village  i thought i saw mr bates  bates  isnt he in london  i might have been wrong i walked over to  where he was standing there was no sign of him  do you know his address in london  as long as hes still there why  ill telephone sir richard and ask him to look into it  but what would he know he works in newspapers  a world of spies tipoffs and private investigators  i promise you he can find out whatever he likes  all right then if you think he can help  good  ill ring him tonight  not bad try to fit in a bit of practice  weve plenty of time to get it right  before theres anyone to see me who matters  i only know sir richard because he is or was  a friend of my fathers and of my uncle jonathan swire  the liberal minister thats it  but im afraid theyve fallen out  oh  this room is so pretty has the house always been the painswicks london home  theres no always about the painswicks my dear  they were invented from scratch by my soninlaws grandfather  we bought the house when we were married  you make mr painswick sound rather a rough diamond lady grantham  marmaduke wasnt a rough diamond was he mama  no he was just cut and polished comparatively recently  carsons told papa youve been called up  theres no need to look so serious  youd think me rather heartless if i didnt  im not going to fight  youll have to i will not  im going to be a conscientious objector theyll put you in prison  id rather prison than the dardanelles  when will you tell them  in my own good time  i dont understand  ill go to the medical ill report for duty  when im on parade ill march out front and ill shout it loud and clear  if that doesnt make the newspapers then im a monkeys uncle  but youll have a record for the rest of your life  at least ill have a life  i know the popular fantasy is that we can feed six strong men  from a single seed cake but you and i know better  have we got the flour for any more go and check now  cheer up  its not as bad as that  whats the matter mr lang  tell me i wont bite  i sometimes feel im the only one who knows whats going on over there  you all wander round ironing clothes  and cleaning boots and choosing whats for dinner  while over the channel men are killed  and maimed  and blown to pieces  we know more than you think the war hasnt left us alone  it hasnt left me alone however it may look  have you any idea  how scared they are  how scared they all are  i lost my nephew  my sisters boy  he was shot  for cowardice  thats what they said  but i knew him and hed never have done such a thing  if he hadnt have been half out of his mind with fear  dont blame him  it was him but it could have been me  it could have been any of us  suppose i dont want to come back  to be in charge telling mr carson what to do  why whats in it for you  all right its to stop mrs crawley bossing her ladyship about  she behaves as if she owns the place  youve changed your tune  when i were last here youd have given money to see her ladyship eat dirt  well like you say ive changed my tune people do  not without a reason ive got my reasons  youve also got her ladyship wrapped round your little finger  maybe thats my business  but ill not hurt her and ill not let anyone else hurt her neither  thats all ive got to say  youre a queer one and no mistake  so will you come if i can fix it  why not  i like the idea of giving orders to old carson  i go away for five minutes and everythings settled  nothings settled  for a start which rooms will we live in  the small library and the boudoir  if cousin isobel can find somewhere else for the intermediaries  theres always the boot room im sure youll have use of that  and where are we supposed to eat  you can share the dining room with those officers  no we all have to make sacrifices  no  then well have tables set up in the great  hall for the mobile officers and the nurses  and lady grantham i know youll be happy about one decision  lady grantham asked that the house management  might be put into the hands of corporal barrow  your former footman thomas  thomas in charge of downton  no thats what i thought at first but he isnt a footman now hes a soldier  hes worked in medicine  someone has to run the place whos had medical training but i feel  the men wont accept the authority of a corporal ive thought of that  i told my commanding officer that lady grantham had asked for corporal barrow  hes prepared to have him raised to the rank of acting sergeant  but can you spare him we can  ive gone to some trouble to do so  sergeant barrow will manage the daily running  of downton and i shall be in overall charge  arent we missing a tier there should be someone  here permanently under you but over thomas  thats correct and i will make a decision before long  until then  i do assure you corporal barrow is very efficient  i say good  if someone is to manage things let it be our creature  why are you planning to divide his loyalties  i wouldnt say i was planning it  william has asked to stay here my lord just for a night  on his way to active duty in france  good i should like to see him  i dont suppose theres any way we can keep him from harm  him being an only child and all  wed hate for anything to happen  thank you lang i can do the rest  very sorry my lord  to get back to the notion of thomas as the manager of downton  he wont be a manager in that sense  but her ladyship fixed it all with clarkson and  she was so pleased i didnt know what to say  i cannot have him working here because he is a thief  you know shes ignorant of thomass crimes  we agreed at the time that would be best  and anyway  is it honourable in us to hold thomass sins against him  when he has been wounded in the service of the king  and who is to be in charge over thomas  you mean under dr clarkson  well we asked today but he hasnt decided  so we just make it up as we go along  unless youve got a better idea  are you still here mr branson stay and have something to eat  mr bransons been telling us the news from russia what news is that  kerenskys been made prime minister but he wont go far enough for me  lenin denounces the bourgeoisie along with the tsar  he wants a peoples revolution and thats what im waiting for  it wont be long now and whats happened to the tsar  imprisoned in the alexander palace with all his family  what a dreadful thing  they wont hurt them why would they  to make an example give them some credit  this is a new dawn a new age of government  noone wants to start it with the murder of a bunch of young girls  you dont know that nobody knows wholl get killed when these things start  look at her nephew shot for cowardice  whod have guessed that when he was saying hello to the neighbours  or kissing his mother good night can you look at the crumble  i think it should come out but its five minutes earlier than you said  im sorry i never thought  then you should think mr lang  youre not the only member of the walking wounded in this house  why are you coming in this way  im the manager here now mr carson  or had you forgotten  no i had not forgotten  and will you be moving into your old room  or should we prepare a guest bedroom  ill sleep in my old room thanks  so  are we ready for the big invasion  cos theyll be here at teatime  well have to be ready wont we thomas  we will mr carson  and its sergeant barrow now  acting sergeant i believe  how many are there altogether   quick as you can gentlemen  driver when youve finished unloading here go straight back  this way please gentlemen  mustard gas  dont worry well get you seen to quickly  major bryant youre in the armada bedroom do you mind the stairs  it depends what i find at the top  hes handsome handsome and offlimits  itll be nice to have the house full of men full of officers  officers arent men not where were concerned  oh speak for yourself i speak for you too if you know whats good for you  im very sorry but i  matthew what in the world are you doing here  we start our tour of yorkshire and lancashire tomorrow  general strutt knew you lived up here so hes given me a few hours off  what a lovely lovely surprise  mrs crawley how can we separate the hospitals linen from our own  you go well talk later  as soon as ive done this ill take your orders for books  i hadnt cast you as florence nightingale  we cant leave all the moral high ground to sybil  she might get lonely there  how are you i know i mustnt ask you what youre doing  you can ask what im doing in downton  weve finished in the midlands tomorrow we  start on the camps in the northern counties  will we see something of you my general ought to come here  its exactly the sort of thing people like to read about sybil come  edith can do that  dear mother she does love a bit of authority  i suppose shes driving cousin cora mad  no names no pack drill  breathe in and out  im surprised they didnt get to you before now  some people have all the luck sir  you can get dressed  shall i report for duty in richmond  youll be told what to do  but i must supervise the medical staff overseen by me  carson im relying on you to make sure that that is so what is going on  i was arranging the household duties  where they overlap with the duties of the nursing staff  shall we continue this upstairs well ive made up some charts  of course  did you say you were the manager or the referee  you see what were up against dont worry well find a solution  you take over every room you bark at me like a  sergeant major and you give orders to my servants  cora im sure  im sorry are you in the middle of something  were discussing the arrangements oh good  weve had a letter from evelyn napier hes in a hospital in middlesbrough  hes heard that were a convalescent home now  and wonders if he can come here once hes released  of course he can come here just a minute  the middlesbrough general will have their own  arrangements for where their patients convalesce  im afraid mrs crawley is right  downton must function as part of the  official system or it cannot function at all  now i think perhaps i should make one thing clear  downton is our house and our home and we will  welcome in it any friends or relations we choose  if you do not care to accept that condition  then i suggest you give orders for the nurses and patients and beds  to be packed up and shipped out at once  thank you lord grantham for making your position so clear  oh just one more thing the dog  what should we do to stop isis getting into the patients rooms  i can answer that  absolutely nothing  ah  anna there you are ethel could you leave us for a moment  that was sir richard on the telephone  it might have been bates you saw in the village  really  hes working up here at a pub  the red lion in kirby moorside  thats odd  mr bates in a pub  the question is whatll you do with the information now youve got it  could you just take this into the hall for me yes of course  are you waiting for papa do you want me to go and find him  they turned me down  the army  why  apparently i have a heart murmur  or to be more precise  a mitral valve prolapse is causing a pansystolic murmur  i dont know what to say is it dangerous  only if youre planning to humiliate the british army  i suppose youre glad  youre not going to be killed or go to prison of course im glad  dont count your chickens if i dont get them one way ill get them another  why do you have to be so angry all the time  i know we werent exactly at our best in ireland  not at your best  not at your best  i lost a cousin in the easter rising last year  you never said well im saying it now  he was walking down north king street one day  and an english soldier saw him and shot him dead  when they asked why he was killed the  officer said because he was probably a rebel  so dont say you were not at your best  sorry to keep you waiting but were going to have to step on it  im not sure about marryat not to worry i know weve got lots of ga henty  and i havent forgotten about your tobacco   just as soon as i can get into the village  i think a bit of it might have come loose  is that better much  but i may need some more tucking very soon  well noone tucks better than i do  ethel  go back inside please  there are still more bedrooms to be done  rosamunds going to find out  she knows some of those feebleminded idiots on the liberal front bench  poor lavinia i feel sorry for her  shes an obstacle to your happiness dear and must be removed  when its done you can feel as sorry as you wish  but even if matthew does break it off with her  why should he propose to me again  with your permission dear i will take my fences one at a time  any plans for your afternoon off  major bryant wants me to go to the pictures in york with him when hes allowed out  but youll say thats stupid  not stupid insane  oh he really likes me though  he says he wants to get to know me better  has he told you how hes planning to achieve it  spoilsport  what are you up to  just practising with these for lady mary i promised her i would  thats one and eight altogether  might i have a glass of cider  thank you  i dont know if ive dreaded this moment or longed for it  well either way its happened  im glad im in time for tomorrows state visit  i gather lavinia will be there we must seize the opportunity to challenge her  i dont really see on what basis  she stole secrets from her uncle jonathan swire  and gave them to carlisle to publish swire told me  the papers showed that half the cabinet were trying to get rich  by buying shares before a government contract was announced  would you rather we were kept in ignorance  it wasnt lavinias business to make it public  without her the marconi scandal would never have happened  the politicians broke the law lavinia did nothing wrong  she drags the chancellor of the exchequers  honour through the mud and you say its nothing  it was only lloyd george  but why did she betray her uncle to sir richard in the first place  because they were lovers  exactly  and now it is down to you to save matthew from the clutches of a scheming harlot  really rosamund theres no need to be so gleeful  you sound like robespierre lopping off the head of marie antoinette  it was me  i knew you used to go into the village on a wednesday  i so longed for a glimpse of you  but why are you up here at all  and why didnt you tell me because i want to get things settled first  you see ive discovered that vera has been unfaithful to me  ive got proof  we cant criticise her for that  no but it means i can divorce her  ive had to leave the house to prove that it has broken the marriage  so i came up here to be nearer you  but what if she fights it she cant  for her to divorce me she needs something beyond adultery  cruelty or suchlike  for a husband adultery is enough  thats not very fair to women  i dont care about fairness i care about you  the point is i can get rid of her  if she goes quietly i will give her money and plenty of it  if not she leaves emptyhanded  and when will this be i need to get her to accept it first  shes made threats about selling stuff to the papers  what stuff  dont worry they wont offer what i will  youve changed your hair  i was trying out lady marys new curling iron  what do you think  i think i would love you however whatever whenever  we dont have to wait you know  if you want me to throw up everything and come with you i will  gladly  i cant marry you yet not legally and i wont break the law  its not against the law to take a mistress mr bates  i know you anna smith and i love you and that is not the right path for you  it wont be long now  so youre not going to war then  apparently not  is it true about mr crawley bringing a famous general here  captain crawley  but yes why  no reason  if they arrive at five well walk him round the  wards then show him the recovering men at play  after that a fairly grand dinner ill tell them to bring mess kit  that is my challenge my lord  how to make the dinner sufficiently grand with no footmen in the house  plenty of people give dinners without footmen  not people who entertain sir herbert strutt hero of the somme  im sure hell have seen worse things at the front than a dinner with no footmen  carson only wants to show the general proper respect  we will not criticise him for that  indeed we will not  i think lord granthams plan is a good one with or without a footman  matthew writes miss swire is coming down from london for it  really  he never said so to me does he need your permission  i think i should go round with him  you and lady grantham will both come with us  but wont he want to talk about the treatments  the treatments and the house  miss  its captain smiley isnt it  we havent met yet but im edith crawley  and tomorrow i can show you where everything is  its just that id like to write a letter to my parents  of course theres paper and envelopes in the library  no you see ive not written before  i didnt want to worry my mother with the different handwriting  im lefthanded hows that for luck  im surprised your school didnt force you to use the right  my mother wouldnt let them but now i wish they had  ive asked the others and they say youre the one to help me  of course i will  id be happy to  thats what they said  if you can just  find a way to tell her  well both find a way  together i promise  mr carson might i have a word  im busy with this dinner for tomorrow night  well thats just it i dont expect youll be using mr lang not after last time  i will not  so i wondered if i might be any help  ive waited at table before do you mean it  i know ive no right to ask it of a chauffeur  we have to keep up the honour of downton dont we  im very grateful mr branson ill not hide it very grateful indeed  you know where to find a livery i do  and i gather you wont be leaving us after all  who knows what the future will bring  aaaaaargh  aaaargh  mrs hughes what is it  who is that shouting  whats going on its mr lang  what in heavens name is happening  no no i cant do it  mr lang i cant do it  wake up youre having a bad dream youre having a dream  its the soldiers mr carson soldiers but i cant  i cant go back no matter what they  noone is asking you to go back mr lang  just to put a sock in it dont worry youve had a bad dream thats all  is it a dream  thank god  oh thank god  thank god youre all right lets get you back into bed  youre all right  im sorry its all right mr lang  im sorry youre all right  is it any wonder when hes been to hell and back  up  up  my cousin lord grantham very kind of you lord grantham  welcome lady grantham  and this is major clarkson who runs our hospital here  and i am captain crawleys mother and will accompany you on your tour  and explain the different levels of care we practise here  lady grantham and mrs crawley will both accompany us as we go round sir  makes a nice change from the craggyfaced warriors im usually surrounded by  id like to think that were true please come this way  theres a large recreational room i dont believe  poor mother how she longs to hold all the reins  crawley  i should go if only to keep our respective mothers apart  im afraid mrs crawley is none too pleased to play second fiddle sir  well i hope she doesnt spoil things  well thats just what ive been meaning to talk to you about sir  im trying to run a tight ship  whats the matter with your aunt  we should follow them in or mama will say were unsupportive  tell me what it is please  all right  i know hes going to propose well then youre going to accept  did you get that picture taken i did yeah  then fetch it  if you think im going to stand by and watch that boys dreams  stamped in the dust youve got another think coming  you can take back your promise when the wars over and not before  but its a lie  dont make him give up when hes off to face the guns  youd never forgive yourself if owt happened  do you remember when aunt rosamund found you  and richard carlisle together in the garden  i knew id hear more about that she thought he was threatening you  and now shes decided  that you were behind the marconi share scandal in 1912  the chancellor and other ministers were involved including your uncle  i remember the marconi scandal  no lets forget it its absurd  but lady rosamund is right  i did steal the evidence for sir richard to print  i did start the scandal  the trouble is aunt rosamund cant understand  why you would do such a thing  unless you and sir richard were  were lovers mary you must come  the ground floor rooms are for those men who need the most care sir  yes of course  general strutt sir  oh right yes  tell me about this officer who is that man  i hope hes not complaining oh no thats captain smiley  he hasnt an unkind bone in his body  how do you know  matthew listen to this everything all right sir  what on earth is that about oh dont worry  major holmes can be a little waspish but he wouldnt want to get us into trouble  how do you know so much about a pack of strangers  theyre not strangers to me  this is all very impressive lady grantham  the nurses and your own staff are to be congratulated  i believe they are  i wouldnt say i was scared  im nervous of course i am  but not scared  i think im ready  dont mind me  only im thinking of what your dear mother would say  well i wish she was here to see me off  oh shed be so proud  why when we waved off our archie i remember  what do you remember mrs patmore  ill tell you  you remember a fine young man who enlisted before he had to  and who gave his life for his country  because hed be alive and well today if he hadnt chosen to go to war  shes right  happen she is  come on daisy back to the grindstone  what is it i just want a word with daisy  im needed in the kitchen  theres plenty of time later on  lets see what my aim is like  and again  you must be enjoying your respite from the front  actually im struggling a bit  ive just lost my soldier servant and i havent managed to replace him yet  so when will you tell matthew  dinner is served my lady  dont waste the opportunity  why must she be so savage its my broken heart  it was her advice that wrecked it in the first place classic rosamund  shes never more righteous than when shes in the wrong come on  everything all right mr branson i think so mrs hughes  wheres mr branson hes just taken up the soup why  read that  theyll have arrested me by now but im not sorry  the bastard had it coming to him  oh  what in gods name read this  where is he now oh my god  thinking of renovating the entire stable  im sorry to hear about your servant  pneumonia not a bullet  no  yes  i dont envy you  a decent servant can change your war  get downstairs now  all right all right theres no need to be so rough  theres every need to stop a murder murder what do you mean murder  you were going to assassinate the general kill the general i was not  eurgh i was going to throw that lot all over him  what is it oil and ink and a bit of a cowpat all mixed with sour milk  hed have needed a bath right enough but not a coffin  i thought youd taken the soup up but you left it in the pantry  well use this its not been heated but the hell with that  well decide what happens to you later  never mind later what about now how do we keep this dinner going  ill serve mr carson i dont mind  and who knows when ill have the chance again  what was going on with the soup  it came it went nothing to worry about my lord  branson was taken ill so william volunteered to be footman one last time  you dont mind do you oh not a bit its very kind of him  our footman william is leaving us tomorrow to join his regiment  thats why hes not in livery youre are a credit to this house and this country  there is no livery so becoming as a uniform  sir  lady rosamund mary all of you have been so kind to lavinia  well naturally were all curious to know more of miss swire  if she is to reign over downton as queen  dear me i hope you havent unearthed anything too fearful  you must ask mary  one thing i am still not quite clear about  who precisely is in charge of downton when youre not here  ive given it some thought sir and it seems to be only fair  that mrs crawley  and lady grantham should share that responsibility  capital well said  the fact is i have been more than gratified by my visit here today  and i thank captain crawley for arranging it  hear hear  you are all to be praised for your response to our national crisis  but ive been talking and ive been listening  i feel there is one among you  whose generosity is in danger of going unremarked  it seems the daily cares and needs of the patients  are being dealt with quietly and efficiently  by lady edith  or thats what the officers tell me  so let us raise our glasses  and drink her health  edith darling lady edith  edith dear  we were never lovers not ever  you dont have to explain anything  not to me but i want to  you see  my father owed sir richard carlisle a lot of money  enough to bankrupt him  and sir richard offered to waive the debt  if you gave him the evidence of the ministers guilt  papa was terrified  and i knew i could get into my uncles office and find the proof  what is it  he threatened to tell you all about it and now ive told you anyway  my uncle was guilty  they all were  sir richard didnt make it up  i believe you  but thats not why i did it  it was entirely to save papa from ruin  ill just go in and check that everything is ready  have you got that picture for me  i might have  because  you know what im going to ask you so will you  william youre not sure  you cant be sure  i am sure  and so is she arent you daisy  isnt this just what you told me you hoped would happen  its like a fairy story  is she right daisy are  are we engaged  because if we are  i know i can tackle whatever may come  go on then  william  do you want to go up top  the general is leaving and mr carson likes a full complement  no daisy not you  the war has not changed everything  the general is just about to leave im  afraid he doesnt have time to come in here  i hope its all been a success  cousin violet said you had something to say to me about lavinia  what is it  i havent the slightest idea oh  what a relief she was hinting you had uncovered some horrid stain  the only evidence ive uncovered is that shes a charming person  what a testimonial  the truth is were very much alike so naturally i think shes perfect  we all do  dont we aunt rosamund  quite perfect  is there any chance you might take our footman william for your servant  i can pull some strings get him transferred to your lot  if youd like me to of course but i cant promise to keep him safe  i know but hed have someone looking out for him  oh my god  lang are you all right old chap  come come man  things cant be as bad as all that  carson mr lang whats happened  sir  the general and all these officers  i dont have to go back with them do i because i cant sir no  the general is looking for you my lord excuse me  its been a great pleasure  if i dont see you again before i have to go back be safe  you too  come inside  up  here weve earned it  ah  so what will you do with him  branson or lang  not mr lang  he isnt well but hes not a bad man  no not at all but he doesnt belong at downton  i meant mr branson  hm its a delicate business mrs hughes  would we really be right to tell the police and cause a furore  and bring a riot down on our heads  and all because he wanted to pour a pot of slop over a mans head  from your phrasing i gather the answer you want from me is no  would it help mrs hughes  thats all im asking would it help  wheres mr branson mr carson sent him back to his cottage to stew in his own juice  will we see you in the morning william to wish you luck  oh yes  but ive got something id like to say now if you dont mind dont not yet  they must know sooner or later  daisy and i are going to be married  you never are when  after the war  im not sure i can wait that long  i see what i had planned to say is already superfluous mr lang  you got there before me  ive let you down mr carson for that im sorry  we let you down  you werent suited for work and i should have spotted that  youll have two months wages and please tell us how you get on  and when youre ready for work again  you may rely on a good report from me  thats kind  thank you  it was nice of william to serve tonight he didnt have to  im going to arrange for him to be matthews servant  with any luck itll keep him out of trouble  matthew and mary looked so natural together did you notice  talking and laughing  but i suppose lavinia is a nice girl  weve dreamed a dream my dear but now its over  the world was in a dream before the war  but now its woken up and said goodbye to it  and so must we  ill stay until you want to run away with me  am i to see if sir richard carlisle has a brother  one whos even richer than he is whats the matter with you  im on your side then be on my side  if i am not appreciated here i will seek some  other place where i will make a difference  good  i am a woman mary i can be as contrary as i choose  watch yourself mr bates thomas is in charge now  we dont need anyone with us  matthews missing
