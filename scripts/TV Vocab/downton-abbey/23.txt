                 i think its held up very well all things considered  especially after all that rain  hows the house team coming on  because were taking this very seriously in the village  nobody takes it more seriously than his lordship dad  whatever he likes to pretend  mr bates has had his rest now and wants to get back to work  its time to draw a line under this whole unfortunate episode  so i go out the window  i cannot hide that i find your situation revolting  but whether or not you believe me i am not entirely unsympathetic  you have been twisted by nature into something foul  and even i can see that you did not ask for it  i think it better that you resign quietly  citing the excuse that mr bates has returned  i will write a perfectly acceptable reference  and youll find that theres nothing about it thats hard to explain  i see  what about tonight  its nearly time to change  so you should dress him tonight and let mr bates take over tomorrow  im not foul mr carson  im not the same as you but im not foul  yes well  weve spoken enough on this subject  now if youll excuse me ill ring the gong  come along miss obrien stop eavesdropping and do some work  i dont know what you  how are you getting on with the cricket team we should be all right  weve still got thomas thank god wont he be leaving soon  not before the match if ive got anything to do with it  one of the gardeners told anna their team is in terrific shape  its so unfair the outside staff play for the village  why dont you support the house and the village you own both  but im captain of the house team  if i were you id be captain of the village they always win  not always usually but not always  mary you look as if youre in a trance  what were you doing in london its worn you out  maybe ill try and rest tomorrow  crikey  id better go before you do  a little bird tells me mr carson has made up his mind to deal with thomas after all  its about time  if you want to register your anger at how thomas treated you now is the hour  im not sure im still disgusted by the whole thing obviously  obviously  but if you dont speak out  people might think you werent disgusted at all  now you must excuse me i ought to be upstairs  anna what are you doing out here  her ladyships with lady mary sir im afraid shes going to be late  let me see whats happening  you couldnt be in better hands than dr ryders truly  i hope to god youre right  annas worried youre getting late heavens you made me jump  i must go obrien will scold me  anna  what were you talking about nothing  womens stuff  your ears must have been burning earlier papa was discussing the cricket match  the village thrashed us last year  i suppose ill have to play you suppose right  because of last year hes absolutely determined to win this time  bates must count himself lucky to be out of it  i think hed like to walk normally sir  even if playing cricket was the price he had to pay  of course he would im so sorry that was stupid of me  its quite all right sir i was only joking  oh theres no question that some people have a feel for it  i think crickets like anything else  when you learn it as a child  theres an understanding that is hard to come by later  and with a father like mine  i was brought up with cricket in my blood  why have you never played in a match before how could i i didnt work at the house until this year  i could hardly play for the village team  well have to start a fan club wont we  thats kind ivy but i just want to do my best for the house  thats all the reward i seek  your modesty is an example to us all mr molesley  what is that youre so glued to this weeks column  ive got to send it off tomorrow whats it about  the poor soldiers how many are reduced to begging on the streets  and some officers are working as dance partners in nightclubs  after the trenches even the embassy club must seem an improvement you shouldnt make fun of them  shes forgetting that you were in the trenches and she wasnt  she must be 18 by now little rose 18 yes how scary  hello  its quite a responsibility well i couldnt say no  her mother is my niece and my godchild and she asked it as a special favour  apparently she hates london  and they cant get to scotland until july  poor shrimpie his work keeps him nailed to his desk  she hates london so shes coming to a greataunt in yorkshire to have a good time mmhm  how original  dont be silly of course you will no i wont  id like to help but ive never played a game of cricket in my life  oddly the game was never a part of my childhood  didnt you play last year no nor the year before that  the fact is ive never played cricket but couldnt you try  robert stop being such a bully lets just have a nice dinner  im afraid ive heard mr carsons going to let him off  what can i do about it say you wont tolerate it  unless hes going to give him a bad reference youll tell the police  i couldnt do that could i why not  and wont you have to  if you dont want folk to think theres something funny about you  its a good job thats supposed to be eaten cold  are you sure about rose wouldnt it be better if she stayed here  no no no im quite looking forward to it  i couldnt manage an 18yearold these days i wouldnt know what she was talking about  my husband was a great traveller  so ive spent many happy evenings without understanding a word  the thing is to keep smiling  and never look as if you disapprove  so bates ill see you on duty tomorrow  good night barrow you do know i wish you every good fortune  i believe so thank you mlord  to the victor the spoils  what will you do oh whats it to you  youre right its nothing to me  if we can buy out simpson and tucker quite a chunk of the estate will be back in hand  well be operating a real business  thats why i think the cricket may have come at rather a good time  why because you think if you get a few runs and catch someone out  papa will accept all this gladly  i think the cricket will show him  it doesnt mean we cant keep up the old traditions as well  and im to help persuade him  of course youre on my team now  you can kiss me but thats it  why havent you missed me  desperately  but london seems to have tired me out  come  mr carson is it true mr barrows leaving  yes and  for what its worth  i think he was genuinely mistaken over the er incident  and hes sorry now which of course is no excuse  i want to be sure youll give him a bad reference  im sorry  i cant let a man like that go to work in innocent peoples houses  i will write him the character i think he deserves  can i read it certainly not  because ive been thinking i ought to report him to the police  what its my duty  i know today thinking is much more liberal now just a minute  ive never been called a liberal in my life and i dont intend to start now  but i do not believe in scandal  mr barrow will go and when he does i would like him to go quietly  for the sake of the house the family  and for that matter you  im sorry mr carson  but i cant stay quiet if my conscience prompts me differently  i wont turn a blind eye to sin  ive asked ethel to bring us some coffee  oh im not supposed to drink coffee my mother doesnt approve  would you like something else absolutely not  after all she wont find out unless you tell her  how is lady flintshire incredibly busy  daddy works harder than a slave  so she has to manage everything else by herself  i doubt he works harder than a slave  cousin isobel is very literal  now i have something for you  shall i pour maam  no thank you ill do it  these  the first answers to the advertisement  cousin violet is trying to find a new job for my cook  that sounds rather inconvenient  cousin violet has never let a matter of convenience stand in the way of a principle  as the kettle said to the pot  im to leave with no reference  after working here for ten years  im afraid my hands are tied  ill never get a job now mr carson  does his lordship know about this no  then im going to tell him  and how would you do that without telling him the rest of it  this wasnt jimmys idea somebodys put him up to it  he wouldnt be so unkind not left to himself  im almost touched that you will defend him under such circumstances  but there it is  well can i stay here for a day or two while i come up with some sort of plan  yes i think i can allow that  but thats the best i can do  thank you mr carson  at least it doesnt smell damp  i think its nice  or it will be when its got a lick of paint  i can do that  i can  youre not climbing any ladders  but yes  together i think we can make it really comfy  what do they call extreme optimism  they call it making the best of things  and that is what we will do  you being in this room is enough to make it nice  come here  we should think of some things to do while youre here  edith you should take rose to whitby market on wednesday shed enjoy that  i cant im going to london on wednesday  oh well could i come  oh but youve only just got here  i thought you hated london who told you that susan  oh darling mummy  well should i correct her oh no shes right really but  im planning a surprise for her  and i need to go to london to arrange it  you wont give me away will you  wont you stay with your parents i cant it would spoil everything  you can stay with me  aunt rosamund wont mind and theres plenty of room  i dont even know where youre going to see my editor to discuss my article  i think i might come up with you to london  ill ring the office in the morning i can stay at my club  dont do that aunt rosamund would love to have you  and i suspect ill need help controlling rose  why do you say that im not sure  instinct  when your mother finds out will she mind no shell be delighted  and so grateful to all of you for helping with my secret  besides with edith as my chaperone what harm can i come to  but how can i help  if our plan works well be farming a third of the estate directly  and you can manage that we think so  but we need you to think so too because lord grantham definitely wont  are you drawing up the battle lines poor robert  the postwar world has not been kind to him  how are you getting on with the agents house  i hope jarvis didnt leave it a wreck no not at all  but the furniture was his so ill have to begin in a state of trappist simplicity  im sure theres some stuff in the attics here well have a look  what about sybbie  wont it be lonely for her  just you and nanny and nobody else for company  i think its right for both of us  mr barrow  what in heavens name are you doing out here  i know youre leaving but things cant be as black as all that  youre trained now you can apply for a position as a butler  you dont know everything then  then will you tell me everything  im afraid if i dare do mrs hughes that  it will shock and disgust you  shock and disgust my my i think i have to hear it now  come on  lady grantham  the dowager that is  has been concerned that your history here has left you lonely  shes kind to concern herself its not just that  she believes youve made this house a local topic of unwelcome conversation  ah  so shes placed an advertisement for you  and shes got some replies  the point is you would go to your new position with references from me  and from mrs hughes  and you would not have to refer to your earlier life  in effect youd be washed clean  yes  is the new maid working out no not really  i dont think shell stay  i miss anna  what do you call her now shes your maid  anna im afraid  i cant very well call her bates  no  whats this about  well  you know matthew wants to come with you to london  why shouldnt he  i just need to check which train youre planning to come back on  the three oclock on thursday why  can you promise not to let him catch an earlier one  of course not what reason would i give  you can think of something please  oh all right  but why is everything always so complicated  well talk about it when matthews back from london cant i have a clue  he should tell you its his idea god it sounds ominous what does  matthew has some ghastly scheme for the estate and toms too frightened to say what it is  i need a drink  you cannot allow him to blackmail you like this  and before you ask thomas has told me the whole story  im only sorry you had to listen to such horrors  why do you think thomas is the first man of that sort that ive ever come across  well i would hope so well he isnt  and ill tell you something else i think james may have led him on  what  i cannot listen to such allegations calm down  i dont mean deliberately but hes a vain and silly flirt  he may have given thomas the wrong impression without meaning to  i can hardly believe were having this conversation  maybe not but i wont sit by and let that young whippersnapper  ruin a man for the rest of his life  not a man who was wounded in the service of king and country  we may have no choice  these practices with which youre apparently so familiar  are against the law  i know that very well then  if we stand up to james and he goes to the police  it will only put thomas in prison which he will not thank you for  inspecting the love nest  just fetching some coal  i envy you  whatever you say  no i mean it  the happy couple and everyones so pleased for you  cant imagine what thats like  perhaps you should try being nicer  its being nice that got me into trouble  what do you mean  never mind  ill be gone soon  and now youre here  youll be glad of that  yes i will be  i assume i can count on you mr molesley  oh ill say theres not much i dont know about cricket  you make me quite nervous  so with you me james alfred both you hall boys  that makes six from down here  i cant play mr carson but i can keep score  good very good  so with his lordship mr crawley and mr branson were already ten  what about you mr barrow  i think ill be gone by then  yes you will  wheres mary i was looking for her but anna said shed gone out  shes away for the night shell be back tomorrow oh  cora is everything as it should be between them  between mary and matthew  oh  yes i think so why do you ask  well i find im rather impatient to get the succession settled  robert its still early days  luncheon is served my lady  is it just us yes  toms on the far side of the estate so he said hed eat in the pub hes hiding from me  until matthews told me the worst probably  may i take the opportunity to bring your lordship up to date with the team are we in good shape  i reckon that with three family players and seven from downstairs were only one short  two short branson wont play  mr branson is busy at the moment  is he my lady  might i point out that were all busy  but we still find time to support the honour of the house  yes but that is not the right road to travel carson  if we want to remain in her ladyships good graces  i know you all have lots of things to do so just run about and do them  ill go and change but i thought wed all have dinner together and have a proper catchup  if youd like but please dont let me be a nuisance we could  i insist a good family gossip will be my payment in kind  then of course wed be delighted good we dine at half past eight  hello operator  knightsbridge 4056  ive been through those replies to her ladyships advertisement  i dont think theres one where i should be happier than here  thats very flattering  there was a nice letter from a mrs watson  but it was near cheadle  cheadles very close to where mr and mrs bryant live oh i see  and you feel that would defeat the purpose  if the goal is to leave your past behind you  dont you maam yes im afraid i do  its a pity if it was the only one that was appealing  so it looks as if ill be staying on  im sorry if it makes trouble between you and the dowager oh dont worry about that  if youd gone shed have found some other bone for us to fight over  you look very pretty today  im not sure how professional it is of me to point that out  well its jolly nice of you  so er business  now ive read your piece  the plight of exsoldiers is not an obvious topic for a womans column  i know it isnt very feminine  but i felt so strongly about it i thought it was worth a try  no no you misunderstand me  i like the idea of a woman taking a position on a mans subject  dont be afraid of being serious when it feels right  really really  no i think were on to something new here  the mature female voice in debate  i dont like the sound of mature no erm  balanced yes lets go with balanced  are you in town tonight and by any chance looking for something to do  i am but sadly im spoken for  thats a pity  but you will let me know when youre up in london again  why are you bothering with thomas  hes going good riddance  i dont know something he said  i feel funny taking his job  you havent taken his job  he filled in for you while you were away thats all  mm  i might ask mrs hughes she usually knows whats going on  oh  which is more than you do  taxi  warwick square please  now i understand  youre not too shocked then no  but why is mr carson its not as if none of us knew  i think the point is we didnt know officially  thats what mr carson finds hard  he cant avoid the subject any longer  because its lying there on the mat  and he cant stand up to jimmy he says hes powerless  and its true we wont help thomas by putting him in prison  i wouldnt wish that on any man  imagine me feeling sorry for thomas  life is full of surprises  you dont think we should have waited  no why should your delicious dinner be spoiled just because rose forgot the time  its my fault i shouldnt have let her out of my sight  nonsense you had stuff to see to  talking of which how did you get on with your editor  oh quite well i think  how about you matthew i was only running errands  my main thing is tomorrow  mead what is it  come on  this is the driver who took up lady rose from outside the house milady  i came back because she left her scarf in the back of my cab  how very good of you  go on tell them why they sent you up to the dining room  i know where she is maam your maid downstairs said you might like to hear  and she was right where did she go  first to warwick square  to pick up her friend  and then you took her on somewhere  eventually i was sat outside for the best part of two hours  how very expensive  when they came out they said they wanted to go to a club  the blue dragon on greek street  and what sort of club is that  well you know  thats the point i dont  this is like the outer circle from dantes inferno the outer circle  there she is heavens what a transformation  and that presumably is the friend she spent two hours with in warwick square  lets not start down that track  oh my  how on earth did you find me  how do you do im a cousin of roses mother  lady rosamund painswick  and this is terence margadale  how do you do please sit down  can you bring some more glasses  tell me where is mrs margadale shes in the country at the  erm  er terence used to work for daddy  so hes more of a family friend really  oh so cousin shrimpie will be pleased to hear about him  no please why dont we dance  now look i think i can get rosamund and edith to keep their mouths shut  if you come with us now and have nothing more to do with this man  at least not until youre out of our charge  but hes hes terribly unhappy and its not his fault  his wife is absolutely horrid married men who wish to seduce young women always have horrid wives  i suggest you meet mrs margadale before you come to any final conclusions  youre wrong hes in love with me he wants to marry me as soon as he can get a divorce  and when will that be  well its terribly difficult yes i thought it might be  now will you accept my conditions or do i throw you to lady rosamund  why are you helping me  im on the side of the downtrodden  excuse me  i rather like warwick square  a sort of belgravia without the bustle  we havent been there very long  rose is feeling rather tired so were leaving  wont you at least stay for a  well no no im glad shes staying  but one forgets about parenthood  the onandonness of it  were you a very involved mother with robert and rosamund  does it surprise you a bit  id imagined them surrounded by nannies and governesses  being starched and ironed to spend an hour with you after tea  yes but it was an hour every day  i see yes  how tiring  after the money turned up from mr swire  things went back to normal  mr carson may i have a word  ill leave you just  well  whens mr barrow leaving  im not sure  hes lost his job why cant he just go i find it very awkward  he made a mistake youre still in one piece  why do you have to be such a big girls blouse about it  im sorry mr carson but i wont change my mind  i suppose you know whos put him up to this mr carson  that mr bates is gobby isnt he  why do you say that  everyone talked about him as if he could walk on water  but hes got a mouth on him  what did he say  he was sticking up for mr barrow  is this because of mr carson not giving him a reference  i dont think its right do you yes i bloody well do think its right  you know nothing about it  whats happened  what did i say  i shouldnt get involved dear  if youll take my advice i should stay out of it  has there been any progress with ethel  no im sorry to disappoint you but she doesnt want to go  not one of them was right one a mrs watson  but the house was near where the bryants live  and to be honest i suspect that was the reason  a chance to see little charlie from time to time  well i cant blame her for that of course not  but the bryants would be bound to find out  which would only lead to more heartbreak  ill write to you as soon as i hear  but its extremely unlikely there is anything wrong at all  this may prove an expensive journey for you  may i ask you a question dr ryder  has my wife been to see you  im not aware of treating a mrs crawley  but even if i had i could not possibly comment on it of course  its only i cant bear to think of her being worried  when i know very well that if anyones to blame its me  im not sure blame is a very useful concept in this area  please believe me that probability and logic  indicate a crawley baby yowling in its crib before too long  thank you  goodbye goodbye  mrs levenson for dr ryder  this should buck you up  why did you go without saying when i knew all along it was me  you know nothing of the sort  in fact it was me  what do you mean  there was something wrong with  actually i cant talk about this sort of thing even to you  you sound like robert well i am his daughter  the fact is  it meant a small operation  what  its all right it was weeks ago  thats why ive been keeping you at arms length  i thought youd gone off me  anyway today was just to see if all is well and he says it is  he says im to get in touch with him in six months time  but that ill be pregnant before then  so now we can start making babies  i feel very guilty not telling susan about last night  mummy wouldnt understand nor do i  what were you thinking  a respectable wellborn young woman going out with a married man  rose knows it all depends on her behaviour for the rest of her stay  one false step and i shall personally telephone lady flintshire  very well  but i dont approve  rose youve obviously read too many novels about young women admired for their feistiness  do you think they will keep quiet  i expect so as long as you stick to your side of the bargain  even cousin rosamund she didnt like being made to keep the secret  probably because she knows that granny will be furious  you see how i turn it  first this way  and now that  alfred whats the matter  im not easy about this business with mr barrow  well why not take a turn with mr moseleys bat  thatll put a smile on your face  is mr carson really not giving mr barrow a reference  what will he do if he hasnt got a reference  he could always go abroad he might do well in america mr barrow  seems a bit drastic why should he go abroad keep your nose out of it  why wont someone tell us whats going on because you wouldnt understand it  i very much hope  why didnt carson tell me hes the one whos being undermined  its a very difficult subject for him to discuss i can imagine  but its not as if we didnt all know about barrow  thats what i said to mrs hughes  if i shouted blue murder every time someone tried to kiss me at eton id have gone hoarse in a month  what a tiresome fellow its not the boys fault my lord  hes been whipped up told if he doesnt see it through  wed all suspect him of batting for the same team  crikey but whod do that  whos got it in for barrow  miss obrien  obrien i thought they were as thick as thieves  not now my lord  now ive spoken to your mother  she has a new plan for when you leave here  but arent i going back to london oh no its so horrid and dusty  what is mummys plan  theyre opening duneagle early youre to go there  on my own no your aunt agatha will keep you company  alone in scotland with aunt agatha  she cant be serious  i know lady agatha isnt much of a party person i admit  this is all because i went up to london to see terence isnt it  how did she find out who gave me away  i dont know who terence is  of course its not your fault aunt violet but they promised  dont shoot the messenger im only relaying your mothers orders  youre to stay for the cricket match and head north the next day  perhaps ill run away  not this time  my maid will travel with you  so you have someone to talk to on the journey  i wont be held a prisoner forever  no one day youll be older and out of our power  but not yet  prisons changed you  there was a time when nothing was too bad for me as far as you were concerned  prison has changed me  you do know miss obrien is behind it  i knew someone was  jimmyd never think of it for himself  doesnt it bother you that shell get away with it  not really  without a reference  after ten years here  youll never work again  not in england  but elsewhere maybe  a cousin in bombay i might go there  i like the sun  you must know something about miss obrien you can use against her  youve heard of the phrase to know when youre beaten  well im beaten mr bates  im well and truly beaten  then give me the weapon and ill do the work  what can i say that will make her change her mind  it is not how we do things  many of the farmers families have been at downton as long as we have  we need to see more profits from the farm here we go profit profit profit  we cannot go forward with no income  but why not tackle it gradually  perhaps buy some time by investing your capital  i hear of schemes daily thatll double whatevers put into them or treble it or more  many offer high rewards very few deliver them  theres a chap in america er charles ponzi  who offers a huge return after 90 days  harry stoke has gone in with a bundle  then harry stoke whoever he is is a fool but if i could find out  last time you took an interest in investment you ruined the family now look here  as captain of this ship roberts entitled to some respect  he didnt mean any disrespect he does a marvellous impression of it  were giving the farmers a choice thats all  if they sell the larger units will let us meet the challenges of the modern world  we need to build something that will last not stand by and watch it crumble into dust  what about the tenants  what about the men and women who put their trust in us  is this fair to them i dont believe so  but isnt the most important thing for them or us  to maintain downton as a source of employment  so youre against me too  it seems to me your plan adds up to carrying on as if nothings changed  to spend matthews money keeping up the illusion  then when weve fallen into a bottomless pit of debt well sell up and go  so yes i believe matthew is right  i see  you seem to be agreed that theres no place for me in all this  so obviously its time for me to take a back seat  hello is that the daily telegraph information desk  i want to find out about a london editor  michael gregson of the sketch  just some general stuff  his education what hes done since then  and a little about his private life  but why here  i dont like the idea of her being our first visitor  i want to be away from the others  i dont know why youre doing this you dont even like thomas  because i know what it is to feel powerless  to see a life slide away and theres nothing you can do to stop it  quite the orator  have you thought about standing for parliament  oh yes very nice  itll be even better with a bit of money spent on it  can i get you some tea  if im staying long enough  i dont know what it is mr bates wants to see me about  youll have time for tea  will that be all maam there is one thing  there was a letter delivered by hand this afternoon  its from the dowager she wants us to call on her in the morning  but why would she want me no doubt well find out in the morning  well i am surprised to find that youre a fan mr oscar wilde  youve known about mr barrow all along so whats changed now  perhaps ive come to my senses  you mean youve found a way to be even nastier than usual  get back in the knife box miss sharp  i want you to persuade jimmy to let mr barrow have a reference  so when he leaves here he can start again  why would jimmy listen to me  i wont do it i think you will  im going sort it out by this evening  or or youll find your secret is no longer safe with me  im just saying i think youve made your point  to let it go now would be the gentlemanly thing to do  you said that if i let it go  theyd think i was up to the same thing  that i wasnt a proper man  if youd done nothing yes  but this way youll come across as merciful and not vindictive do you see  i never wanted to push it this far  then youll be glad to stop it  youre sure i wont be made to look a fool  far from it  i think theyll hold you higher in their estimation  ah james upstairs please  may i have a word with you please mr carson before we go up  but why london youve only just got back  ive had some bad news thats all what sort of bad news  never mind its not our business  hows the cricket team coming along were still two short  and youre still determined not to play  its not that i wont play i cant play i dont know how  stop twisting his arm  any news on the move tom were going to miss you both so much  you told matthew not to twist his arm now youre doing exactly the same  i just think children are happier in families im sorry but i do  well im glad thats settled  but i suppose barrow will have to go  my lord  hes so good at cricket  i know we were soundly beaten last year but he got most of our runs  i thought we just wanted him to have a reference so he could find work when he leaves  i know but now that i think about it carson ought to insist that he stays on  he needs to reestablish his authority over james  couldnt mr barrow just stay till after the match and then go  that seems rather unkind wouldnt we be using him  he might not want to stay my lord after the unpleasantness  i think he will  but dont forget the cricket  i wont my lord  see how my grip is firm  but tender  cherish the ball dont crush it  right gabriel have a try  is it true youve given in and let mr barrow get away with it  it was dragging on and on at least this way well be rid of him  i heard his lordship wants him to stay for the cricket match it wont be for much longer  then hell get his reference and go  and good riddance  im going over to windmill farm  to see what we can do with the outbuildings  would you like to come with me im sure you can manage on your own  arent you going ill meet him there later  hes putting a good face on it  but you know he wants you with him on this more than anything  i should not serve him well  i dont have the instincts for what he wants to do  you mean youre not a tradesman your word not mine  shall i tell you how i look at it  every man or woman who marries into this house every child born into it  has to put their gifts at the familys disposal  im a hard worker and ive some knowledge of the land  matthew knows the law and the nature of business which i do not  you understand the responsibilities we owe to the people round here  those who work for the estate and those that dont  it seems to me if we could manage to pool all of that  if we each do what we can do  then downton has a real chance  youre very eloquent  youre a good spokesman for matthews vision  better than he has been recently  so youll give us your backing  ill think about it  on one condition  you play cricket for the house  we all have to do what we can do  for gods sake if it means that much to you  oh  you didnt expect to find me here no  i thought the only person who could tell us with any accuracy  the bryants response to ethels working nearby  were the bryants themselves  lady grantham wrote to me explaining your wish  well it was only that mrs watson had answered the advertisement  i know the circumstances  just as i know that you would like to see how charlies getting on  as it happens ive been uncomfortable  about keeping a mother from her son  although i would not want to confuse him until hes much older if then  you wouldnt have to confuse him ive already worked it out  im his old nanny employed by you when he was first born  but what about when he talks about you to mr bryant you will please leave mr bryant to me  now ethel you must write to mrs watson today and get it settled  and ill be able to see charlie  it wont be easy  itll be easier than not seeing him  very much easier  and if mr barrow is to stay on what would he be my valet  you can make him underbutler then your dinners will be grand enough for chu chin chow  and he can apply to be a butler when he does leave  but that would make him my superior  oh i dont know underbutler head valet theres not much in it  the question remains  how do we convince james  well  its his lordship who wants mr barrow to stay on  so i think his lordship can bring it about  is this worth it  ive no time to learn anything  couldnt i just trust to beginners luck certainly not  i want you to profit from my skills in gratitude for bringing robert round  not completely not yet  elbow up  you wont make a gentleman of me you know  you can teach me to fish ride and shoot but id still be an irish mick in my heart  so i should hope  there see youre getting the hang of it  im sorry if this is inconvenient  its unexpected not inconvenient  i suppose id better just say it  please do  i had the impression on my last visit that you were flirting  giving signs that you found me attractive  if im wrong then i apologise  youre not wrong  but since then i have discovered that you are in fact married  yes  im afraid i find the idea of a married man flirting with me wholly repugnant  so i must hand in my resignation at once  no its true i am married but i hope youll allow me to explain  explain what i am familiar with the institution of marriage  yes but not with this one  my wife is in an asylum and she has been for some years  lizzie was a wonderful person i loved her very much  it took me a long time to accept that the woman i knew was gone  and wouldnt be coming back  then why havent you got a divorce  i cant a lunatic is not deemed responsible  shes neither the guilty nor the innocent party  it means that im tied for the rest of my life to a  a madwoman  who doesnt even know me  i cant begin to tell you how much it cheers me to read your column  and to meet when we do  i hope very much youll consider staying on  heads ah well there we are  yes  im glad everythings settled with ethel  but i trust you can find another cook without too much difficulty  preferably one with a blameless record  so my house ceases to be a topic of gossip which is really what this is all about  well if ethel wants to be part of her sons life even a little part  who are we to stand in her way  if youd had to sell charlie to the butcher to be chopped up as stew to achieve the same ends  you would have done so  well happily it was not needed  howzat  well shot sir  well played barrow thank you excellent innings  i thought i was helping him get out of our lives for good  now he ranks higher than i do  ive been a damned fool  by the way what was that phrase he gave you to say to miss obrien  you can tell me now surely  if you keep it under your hat  it was her ladyships soap what  i cant make any sense of it either but thats what he said  her ladyships soap  and it worked  its down to you molesley last man in  were in good shape thanks to barrow but we could do with a bonus  dont worry ill show them a thing or two thats the spirit  well done papa i did my best well just have to hope its enough  anna says we are to expect great things of molesley ah  out  well bowled  as usual our expectations are disappointed  lets have some tea  who gave me away  was it you certainly not  in case you dont know im being sent north tomorrow with a monster for a jailer  well what did she expect  carrying on with a married man as if her home were in a tree  granny who told you  how could you have done that after you promised  but mama said you told her i just filled in the details  i never said a word  have you tricked me mama tricked im not a conjurer  i only did what was necessary to preserve the honour of the family in other words you tricked me  james  you put up a very good show out there well done thank you mlord  as a matter of fact i wanted to thank you for your generosity with barrow  letting him stay on shows a real largeness of spirit  stay on  mr barrows staying on as underbutler  i was given the impression youd allowed it  i allowed him to have a decent reference when he left  but you wont mind too much will you  oh by the way congratulations on your appointment as first footman  what  thank you mlord very much  lord grantham i believe  the same  looking for a mr alfred nugent my lord  and you are inspector stanford and sergeant brand york police  alfred cant have got into trouble with the police thats not possible  hes made a complaint concerning a mr thomas barrow  making an assault of a criminal nature on another of your employees  that is a very serious allegation  serious enough to bring us here to interrupt your cricket match  if youd point out the young gentleman hes over ill fetch him  well go with you i think its better to leave it to his lordship  im sure he can get to the bottom of it  but i know what i saw and it werent right  im not asking you to abandon your beliefs alfred  just to introduce a little kindness into the equation  am i not to stand up against evil evil  thomas does not choose to be the way he is  and what harm was done really that his life should be destroyed for it  well let he who is without sin cast the first stone  are you without sin alfred for i am certainly not  sorry about your son mr molesley dont be  he talks such a lovely game he could always talk a good game of cricket  he just couldnt play it  just as i thought theres been a mixup  alfred here witnessed some roughhousing between two of the staff and misinterpreted it  why did you make the telephone call without checking your facts  im very much afraid to say he was a bit squiffy werent you alfred  i made the call before i knew what i were doing  id been at the cider youd what  oh i think we can overlook it this once  dont you carson  so theres nothing to investigate im terribly sorry to have wasted your time  would you care to have some tea  no thank you lord grantham i think weve got the measure of it  good luck with your match  where is nanny  gone to get some baby paraphernalia  shall i tell her youre looking for her  no

wouldnt move out until shes older  would you mind i should be delighted  and i know its what sybil would want  i think youre right  tom says roberts ready to get behind the plan  im glad  so well be building a new kingdom while we make our little prince  im looking forward to both enormously  right gentlemen times up  were about to start again  i hope i can count on you not to laugh when i drop the ball  you can always count on me  i know that  i didnt think it was possible to love as much as i love you  matthew hurry up youre keeping everyone waiting  ive got to go of course you have  tom
