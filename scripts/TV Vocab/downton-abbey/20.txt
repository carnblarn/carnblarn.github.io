                the pains have stopped nothing will happen yet  everything is fine he sighs with relief  you mean it was a false alarm not exactly  these early labour pains show that the womb is preparing itself for birth  dr clarkson im afraid lord grantham doesnt enjoy medical detail  the point is can we all go back to bed  you can  and so can i ill see you out  sir philip tapsell will be here tomorrow of course  if you think it advisable  there really is nothing wrong nothing at all  she a healthy young woman going through a very normal and natural process  i think id rather be in the city if i were having a baby  where theyve got all the modern inventions  far away from everyone you know and trust i dont think i would  what are you talking about having babies for ivy  i think we can leave that for a little further down the menu  its always an idea to be prepared  i expect youre always prepared i try to be mr barrow  i dont like the direction this conversation is taking  could we all begin the days tasks please  and remember  lady sybil is in a delicate condition so no noise on the gallery  its exciting though int it to have a baby in the house  it wont make much difference to you  now get back in the kitchen and do as youre told  well i think that message got through  we cant risk her welfare to soothe clarksons feelings  i know i like the old boy but he did misdiagnose matthew  and he did miss the warning signs with lavinia  thank you obrien  is that fair  he didnt wanna get matthews hopes up when it wouldnt make any difference  with lavinia the disease moved like lightning  i know i know but even so  sir philip tapsell may have delivered many lords and royal highnesses  but he doesnt know us  ill ask him to include clarkson in his deliberations will that satisfy you  i suppose so  you look a bit puzzled i am mr carsons asked me to wind the clocks  you must be doing well in this house that marks  you out as first footman more than anything could  thats just it i said thank you right away but i know nothing about clocks  youd better ask mr barrow hes the clock expert  he used to wind them but of course  its quite wrong for a valet to do it  mr barrow wont mind oh no  i can see he likes you and thats good since hes got the ear of his lordship  yes i suppose he would have  id keep in with him if i were you i will  thank you think nothing of it  im the size of a house  my back hurts  my ankles are swelling  and my head aches  honestly i cannot recommend this to anyone  i am listening but of course im dying to start one of my own  so youre not waiting waiting for what  i dont know but i did wonder  mary you know what i said about the baby being catholic  ive just realised that the christening will have to be here  in downton  blimey  i wanted the whole thing done in dublin  out of sight out of mind  but we cant wait forever  we cant not christen it the poor thing  you dont have to do this its your baby too  i dont mind  i mean i do believe in god but all the rest of it  vicars feast days  and deadly sins  i dont care about all of that  i dont know if a vicar knows any more about god than i do  and i love tom so very very much  ill let you rest  and dont worry ill fight your corner with travis if it comes to it  there you feel a slight increase in the resistance  i think so thats what youre watching for  never go past the point where the clock is comfortable  you make it sound like a living thing  clocks are living things my dad was a clockmaker  i grew up with clocks i understand them  never wind them in the early morning before a room has warmed up  nor too late when the night air cools them down  find the time when the familys out of the room  anna but i dont understand why was i kept away from you until now  whatever the reason its over the point is someone has to question mrs bartlett  you wrote and said she saw vera on the evening of the day of her death  thats right  she went for a walk the door was open and she went in  she saw vera was cutting pastry from under her nails  i wrote that because it was such a strange detail for her to remember  she was making the pie that she ate that  night when i was on the train back to downton  so vera planned this  she meant for you to be imprisoned and hanged for her suicide  it was her revenge  and what a revenge for both of us  but theyll say you poisoned the milk  or the flour or something to catch her after youd gone  they tested everything in the kitchen  they said it was in the pastry where i couldnt have put it  sighs  oh i hope shes burning in hell  dont go down that road  once you do theres no way off it  ive been thinking about you since we last met  and wanted to know how you were living  ive not gone back to  doing what i was doing if thats worrying you  ive no charlie to feed so now if i starve i starve alone  id rather starve than do that  you seei thought you might work here for a while  helping mrs bird  it would mean that when you moved on you will have had a respectable job  with a respectable reference  are you sure youve thought about this maam  what will mrs hughes reaction be or lady granthams  and old lady grantham  i cant wait to hear what she has to say about it  dont you want to come  its not that maam  youre offering a return to a wholesome world and i am very very grateful  well then  but i think its going to be a lot more complicated than you allow  then we shall have to face those complications together shant we  ill take him from here sir  bates seems very cheerful is he  he has a visit from his wife earlier she must have brought him some good news  it hardly seems fair does it  youve got an extra year and ive got a formal reprimand  and mr bates whos done it all whos  made all the trouble for us gets good news  what do you think it is  she cant be pregnant he was arrested a year ago  she might be but he wouldnt be very happy about it  so what do you wanna do um  itll need some thought first what does this good news consist of  when you shared with him where did he keep his letters  quite a few of the cottages have been renovated  thanks to you maybe a little thanks to me  but many of the farms have been left entirely to their own devices  coulter hasnt farmed this properly for 20 years  he struggles to pay the rent which is too low anyway  theres been noinvestment  papa would say you cant abandon people just because they grow old  i agree but it would be cheaper to give him a free cottage  and work this land as it should be worked  i see and you dont think papa understands that  maybe he harks back to a time when money was abundant  there wasnt much need to keep on top of it  i think he equates being businesslike with being mean  or worse middleclass like me  the middle classes have their virtues and husbandry is one  we ought to get back sir philip thingys due on the seven oclock train  you ought to be there to hold toms hand  poor fellow  hes so terrified and so thrilled at the same time  as i would be  as i will be  the dear duchess of truro is full of your praises sir philip  then of course you know that  she had quite a time when she was first married but i said to her  never fear duchess ill get a baby out of you one way or another  and so you did  three boys and as a result a secure dynasty im glad to say  but you see no complications here  none at all lady sybil is a perfect model of health and beauty  we told our local doctor wed send a message  to him when it looks as if the babys coming  dr clarkson has known us all since we were girls  yet whats needed here lady mary is a knowledge of childbirth nothing more  but if it soothes you then of course  hes most welcome  im going to check on sybil  sorry to trouble you my lord but i wondered if i might have a word  come into the library  matthew will you take sir philip to the drawing room  shall we go in  sir philip i was rather hoping to have you to myself for a moment  do you know that i was injured during the war  i think i did hear something about it from lady grantham  my spine was very severely bruised  and for a time it seemed id lost the use of my legs  and  everything else  but the bruising reduced and you recovered i have heard of this  well how relieved you must have been  yes but i wonder now whether the injury might have  affected my  i suppose i mean my fertility  if it may have limited my chances of fathering a child  well isis everything working as it should  yes  then um  why do you think there may be a problem  were anxious to start a family  weve been married for a few months without anyresults  my dear mr crawley  may i point out the word that gives you away  anxious  anxiety is an enemy to pregnancy  dont whatever you do feel anxious  i can run a test if you wish but i would urge you  not to bother for some time yet  there you are we were wondering what had happened to you  this is extraordinary  why did the police miss it so completely  mrs bartlett never spoke to them she never spoke to anyone  except to you  she didnt think the truth would make any difference now  she thought it was only further proof of his guilt  the difficulty is she may not want to accept bates innocence  doesnt she have to not necessarily  she may think he drove his wife to suicide and deserves to rot in prison  in short she may not wish to tell the truth to set him free  then we need to get a statement from her  before she finds out it could overturn the case  ill telephone murray tonight he can come up here and talk to you and see bates  you were right though  the proof was out there and you found it  the editor of the sketch wants me to write for him  he saw my letter to the times and wants to give me a regular column  how regular  and what about  once a week and i can write about whatever i like  it would be the problems faced by a modern woman  rather than the fall of the ottoman empire but even so  will you write under your own name  i hadnt thought  you wont have an option thats what hes buying  thats what he wants  your name and title  i dont know i thought ediths letter to the times was very interesting  dont bother matthew  im always a failure in this family  im sad to hear this mrs bird  and im sad to say it madam but its kept me awake all night  and i know i cannot work alongside a woman of the  a woman who has chosen that way of life  but miss parks has changed  maybe she has and maybe she hasnt  but if i tolerate her i would be tarnished by it  suppose people come to think that id followed the same  profession as what she has  nobody could look at you and think that mrs bird  well i hope not because im a respectable woman  i may not have much but i have my good name  and i must protect it  youll have a months wages in lieu of notice  where will you go back to manchester  i can stay with my sister  she says theres plenty of work for a plain cook these days  and they will find one in you  goodbye mrs bird and good luck  anything else you need to know about having babies ivy  honestly if i told mrs patmore the things  you two say to me youd be up before mr carson  what are you doing with your afternoon off  none of your business id like to make it my business  have you greased the cake tins yes  what about the pastry  its in the larder get started on the vegetables for tonight  she doesnt want much does she she doesnt like me  why not i dont know  she just doesnt  well anyone who doesnt like you needs their head examining  i hope you agree with him jimmy  thatd be telling  are we the first down  how is sybil sleeping thank god  shes been restless all afternoon i dont think itll be long now  im sorry it couldnt have been in dublin  we know how much it meant nothing means more than she does  and youre sure you have everything you need quite sure  hello granny youre here how nice  your grandmother will be with us every night until the babys born  i hate to get news secondhand  well you wont have long to wait  i thought id bring up dr clarkson after weve eaten  yes ive been talking to lord grantham about the good doctor  sir philip feels the room would be too crowded  it might be better to leave old clarkson out of it for the time being  but i said id telephone  well it really isnt necessary  ive given him my word  why dont i run down in the car after dinner and fetch him  the hollandaise for the fish put it in the sauce boats and do the souffles  as soon as  will you just do it  out of my way quick  what are you doing  havent you done it oh my god  whats happened its curdled and its got to go up in a minute oh my lord  ivy can manage it go on with what youre doing can you really  i can  now what give me an egg quick  dribble it in but its ruined do what i say  how does that work  its magic its one of the tricks of the trade  how have you done that justone of the tricks of the trade  well go and take it up well done ivy you played a good one there  thank her daisy yes thank you  that didnt hurt at all did it  ill tell you what daisy alfred wont like  you any better for being rough on her  i should have the fish ill do it  sighs theres nothing more tiring than waiting for something to happen  edith have you written back to your editor yet  whats this edith has had an invitation to write a newspaper column  when may she expect an offer to appear on the london stage  see  oh god is it beginning  dinners suspended so to speak  yes but suspended cancelled or suspended keeping it hot  what should i do about dinner down here  i couldnt tell you  but  what do you mean concerned  lady sybils ankles are swollen she seemsmuddled  what sort of muddled not quite there not quite in the present moment  and what do you think it means it means shes having a baby  a word dr clarkson  excuse me  sir philip mustnt bully him into silence  my dear this is just clarksons professional pride  like barbers asking who last cut your hair  they always want to be better than any other practitioner  but we must listen to what he has to say  i quite agree i dont want to hurt sir philips feelings  if theres one thing that im quite indifferent  to its sir philip tapsells feelings  you are upsetting these people for no reason at all  i am not  i think she may be toxaemic with a danger of eclampsia  in which case we must act fast there is no danger whatsoever  judging by my experience lady sybil is behaving perfectly normally  do you not find the baby small not unusually so  and the ankles  maybe she has thick ankles lots of women do  but she does not  im warning you doctor if you wish to remain  you must be silent  i cannot allow you to interfere  sighs  oh  dont be burnt  screams  are you all right ethel only i heard a shout  fine maam everythings fine  its a kidney souffle maam  a kidney souffle isnt that a bit adventurous  ive seen mrs patmore do it a hundred times  yes but she cant have begun her career as a cook by making a kidney souffle  shall i try something else maam  no if were to avoid a midnight feast its  too late to turn back  is everything all right  i think so ive just come to fetch some warm milk in case she fancies it  mr carson  im glad ive caught you  ive had a letter from mrs bird who used to work for mrs crawley  i didnt know shed gone well thats the point  ive been thinking about what we should do  you know i have a brother in liverpool and there might be an opening there  itd mean working with cars again  no  were not going backwards you must promise me that  groans  god i wish there was something i could do  just be here  we can just lie back and look at the stars  gasps  is she  its all just as it should be  now what  i want to test the latest sample of her urine oh for heavens sake  just give the order to the nurse please sir philip  hows the young mother doing am i on duty dr clarkson  what only i swear im not on duty otherwise i wouldnt be lying here  no no youre not on duty  she moans  hyperventilates  mrs crawley has hired a prostitute to manage her house  and thats why mrs bird felt she had no choice but to hand in her notice  nor did she poor woman mr carson this is ethel were talking about  our ethel  and mrs crawley was just trying to give her a helping hand is that so wrong  i do not criticise her for her charity but she hasnt considered her actions  no respectable person  certainly no respectable woman   can now be seen entering her house  but ethels given all that up  i didnt think she was running a brothel in mrs crawleys kitchen  cant we say nothing for now  mrs birds gone and i dont remember ethel as any great cook  so it may sort itself out  sighs  very well  we shall keep silent for the moment  but i dont want the maids going into that house on any pretext whatsoever  is that clear  quite clear mr carson  or the footmen  its my belief that lady sybil is at risk of eclampsia  what is that a rare condition from which she is not suffering  tell him why you think she may be  her baby is small she is confused and there is far too much albumen   that is protein  in her urine  dr clarkson please have you forgotten my mother is present  please a woman of my age can face reality far better than most men  the fact remains if i am right we must act at once and do what  get her down to the hospital and deliver the child by caesarean section  but is that safe it is the opposite of safe  it would expose mother and child to untold danger  she could pick up any kind of infection in a public hospital  an immediate delivery is the only chance of avoiding  the fits brought on by the trauma of natural birth  it may not work but  honesty at last  even if she were at risk from eclampsia which she is not  a caesarean is a gamble which might kill either or both of them  i think we must support sir philip in this  but its not our decision  what does tom say  tom has not hired sir philip  he is not master here and i will not put sybil at risk on a whim  if you are sure sir philip i am quite quite certain  youre being ridiculous obviously we have to talk to tom  dont look at me cora is right  the decision lies with the chauffeur  how are things going im not sure  the doctors are arguing thats never a good sign  is everything all right unfortunately it seems it is not  could we get her to hospital to move her would be tantamount to murder  sir philip admit youre beginning to detect the symptoms yourself  you can see her distress can you yes lady sybil is in distress  shes about to give birth  lord grantham mr branson time is running out  wed be at the hospital by now if wed acted at once the baby would be born  if she has the operation now do you swear you can save her  i cannot swear it no  but if we do not operate and i am right about her condition then she will die  if if lord grantham can you please take command  tom dr clarkson is not sure he can save her  sir philip is certain he can bring her through it with a living child  isnt a certainty stronger than a doubt  i dont mean to insult sir philip but dr clarkson knows sybil  hes known her all her life so youd take her to the hospital  i wouldve taken her an hour ago screaming  god help us  screaming continues  any news from the house maam  not yet  matthew said he would try and telephone if its not too late  lady sybil was always kind to me  yes shes a very dear girl  what  whats in this  some honey was that not right  its perfectly fine for now ethel  but perhaps not another time  would you like anything mama no  just good news of the baby and a car to take me home  i dont suppose i shall get either before long  what about you tom  i just feel so helpless  we men are always helpless when a babys in the picture  door opens  you can come up its a girl  and theyre both theyre fine  oh thank god  and hallelujah  shes so beautiful  oh my darling  i do love you so much  i just want to sleep really  of course you do youve earned it  shes a wonderful baby  i think we should let her sleep  very well done thank you  mama  yes my darling  tom is thinking of getting a job in liverpool  going back to being a mechanic but it wouldnt be right for him  he needs to move forward  well talk about it tomorrow  you dont need to worry about it now  i think  papa may see it as some kind of answer  and   your father loves you very much  i know  i know and i love him terribly  but will you help me do battle for tom and the baby if the time comes  of course lady grantham  now sleep darling  im sorry we doubted no  as to that lady grantham its always a good idea  to forget most of what was said during the waiting time  and simply enjoy the result  is there anything more to be done  not really  the nurse will stay with her and so i suggest we all get some sleep  and meet again refreshed in the morning  show us a card trick jimmy  its your move  thats it the baby is born  its a girl  fantastic now you can all go to bed  good news do you like lady sybil  i do we worked together in the hospital during the war  so i know her better than all of them really  shes a lovely person like you  anything the matter no  no but mr barrows so familiar all the time isnt he  im glad to hear it thats a very good sign  if hes taken to you hell definitely put in a good word with his lordship  id like to tell him to keep his distance  do you want to get your marching orders then  why what are you implying  nothing unseemly i hope  no  no nothing like that  good night  mama wake up its sybil  hyperventilating  tries to speak  can you hear me darling its tom i should be getting up  darling all you need to do is rest  she cries out  sybil  my head  my head sybil let me bathe your forehead  it hurts  whats happening  oh god  oh god  god no no what the hell is happening  sybil she cant hear me  sybil sybil its mary can you hear me  it looks as if   it looks as if what this is eclampsia  sybil  it cannot be sir philip you were so sure  she cant hear me this is unbelievable  darling somebody do something  the human life is unpredictable but you were so sure  what can we do help her help her please  sybil hyperventilates  oh god no dr clarkson shall we take her to the hospital  theres nothing that can be done its not possible not these days  once the seizures have started theres nothing to be done  you dont agree do you  please dont leave me help her help her please  she cant breathe please just breathe  there has to be something worth trying  please come on come on breathe love  come on sybil listen its me my darling all you need to do is breathe  weve given her morphine and atropine  whats happening  please breathe love  please  she cant breathe  tom sobs  cora oh no no  please  oh no  tom please love  no no please wake up  please dont leave me  please wake up love please dont leave me  please dont leave me love  she gasps  no oh god  tom please love  tom sobs  but this cant be  shes 24 years old  this cannot be  cries of baby  is there anything we should do mr carson  carry on daisy  as we all must  thomas  i dont know why im crying really  she wouldnt have noticed if id died  you dont mean that  no no i dont  in my life i can tell you not many have been kind to me  she was one of the few  oh dont mind me  the sweetest spirit under this roof is gone  and im weeping myself  are you all right mr carson  i knew her all her life you see  ive known her since she was born  well look after them  well look after them both  dont you worry about that  its time to go to bed mama  youll need some rest to face tomorrow  not just yet this is my chance to say goodbye to my baby  you go  ill be all right i promise  i could stay or would you prefer to be alone  alone i think but thank you  and mary  could you ask your father to sleep in the dressing room tonight  because you were my baby  you always will be always  my beauty my baby  ive asked carson to bring anna here mr murray  but i dont think itll be possible for you to see lord grantham  not today im sure you understand  of course  i should have guessed there was something wrong when there was no car at the station  what a dreadful dreadful thing  door opens  ill leave you to it  mr murray i wonder if i might have a word with you before you go  its not the best day for it but theres no knowing when you might be up here again  of course mr crawley  i am very sorry to trouble you on a day like this mrs bates  you werent to know none of us could have known  the men from grasbys have arrived  to take her away  yes  and we must let them  goodbye my darling  she was the only person living who always thought you and i were such nice people  oh mary  do you think we might get along a little better in the future  i doubt it  but since this is the last time we three will all be together in this life  lets love each other now as sisters should  you see what i have discovered is quite simple mr murray  its proof of my husbands innocence  that seems a good place to start  yes but the key to his innocence  depends on the word of a woman who hates him  and may want him to stay in prison whatever the truth  why not tell me everything you know  of course this isnt the right time  but youre here and its not a subject for the telephone  no but i must confess to you mr crawley that  even at this sad hour your words are music to my ears  testing times are coming for these estates indeed  theyve already arrived and many great families will go to the wall  over the next few years  its never been more vitally important to maximise the assets of a place like this  and run it with a solid business head  what are you talking about  mr crawley and i were discussing the management of the estate  he was outlining some interesting plans for the future  and do you intend to involve my father in these fascinating plans  of course  then i cannot think this a very appropriate moment  to be deciding the destiny of downton mr murray  when my sisters body has just been removed from the house  and my father is quite unable to see or speak to anyone  im really only here to talk to mrs bates about her new evidence  naturally if id known  no no thats quite different  none of us would wish to keep bates in prison for an hour longer than necessary  shall i fetch her ive already seen her  now im on my way to york to visit bates  and learn what he has to say about it  then thank you so much for coming all this way  lady mary please tell your parents how very sorry i am  of course  mr murray is just leaving  im sorry darling forgive me i wasnt thinking  its just murray was in the house  papa has lost his youngest daughter  i think thats enough  or does he have to lose control of his estate on the same day  and the challenge is to get a statement from  mrs bartlett before she realises its significance  thats it  i cant stop thinking about lady sybil  a lovely young woman at the height of her happiness  if i had any beliefs that would shake them  make your way out now  ill keep you informed mr bates  ill do my very best for you  thank you mr murray  i suppose thats his lawyer  lord granthams lawyer more like  i dont care if hes lawyer to the prince of wales  hell get a shock when he contacts mrs audrey bartlett  oh carson good afternoon my lady  weve seen some troubles you and i  nothing worse than this nothing could be worse than this my lady  she gasps  mama  oh my dears  youll be glad to know theyve found a nurse for the baby  she is already here good good  wheres tom  hes upstairs ive asked if he wants anything  he says no  he wants his wife back but thats what he cant have  i must write to dr clarkson and have it sent down before dinner  darling theres no need for that i should i want to  i have to apologise for our behaviour  mary what  why  because if wed listened to him sybil might still be alive  but sir philip and your father knew better and now shes dead  why why did she say that  because there is some truth in it  my dear when tragedies strike  we try to find someone to blame  in the absence of a suitable candidate we usually blame ourselves  you are not to blame noone is to blame  our darling sybil has died during childbirth  like too many women before her  and all we can do now  is cherish her memory  and her child  nevertheless there is truth in it  i thought i might move back in here tonight  i think id rather sleep alone for a while  we should think about the christening shell be catholic  shes irish and will be catholic like her father  what were you doing at crawley house this morning who says i was there  i saw you coming out oh i see  you look very nice this morning dont flirt with me robert not now  what do we do next  anna you mustnt do anything stupid  promise me  you wont win over the christening not if youre against me  im never against you but youve lost on this one
