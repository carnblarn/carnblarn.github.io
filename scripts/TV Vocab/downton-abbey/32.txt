                i assume drewe knows were coming  yes i sent a note yesterday  have the pigs recovered do you think  they look in good shape to me after the shock of their arrival  but why didnt he check to see   they all had water before he left for the night  maybe he thought a full trough was enough  he wasnt to know theyd kick it over  mr branson is right he should have made sure  you would have done  where did you learn about pigs  weve always had pigs at yew tree mlady  not many but enough to learn their ways  thank heavens you did  so have you found a man to take over  not yet  first wed like to know if youd want the job  me you mean im to manage the pigs for the estate as well as my farm  its asking a lot  i can do it if youre sure  lets give it a try see how we get on  im very grateful mlady  this is the second good turn ive received from your family  and i just hope i can pay back a favour one day  how nice of you  i dont know if its much of a favour  were giving you a lot of work works like old age mlady  the worst thing in the world except for the alternative  its only me  i always feel that greeting betrays such a lack of self worth  how are we today  my dear please stop talking to me as if i were a child past hope  very well how are you feeling  like doctor manette  if i dont get out of this house soon  i shall remember nothing but my number  then why dont we walk to the abbey this afternoon if its fine  hear how roberts getting on in america  is it really called the tea pot dome scandal  it seems so unlikely whats it about  what is it always about bribery and corruption  taking money to allow private companies  to drill for oil on government land  mr levinson has one of these companies  i assume so  have you ever met him once at the wedding  and once was quite enough  i cant tell you how thrilling that sounds ill be waiting for you  well have such a lovely day  who was that noone just a friend  you have to pull your weight with the bazaar  it seems to have crept up on me  does cousin robert usually do it  he does half the village hates the other half  and only he can stop them tearing each others throats out  i admire that its a real skill  mr molesley erm is it true that you were a valet  for the late mr crawley  and butler to his mother before that  ive come down in the world you can climb up again  maybe but life kicks the stuffing out of you sometimes doesnt it  oh ive had my stuffing kicked out more than once  ive woken and wondered if there was any point to it  yet here i am ladys maid to a countess  so it can happen  now youve made me curious  im curious about something and you could help me  do you know if mr and mrs bates have had a falling out  mr and mrs bates that doesnt sound very likely  can i ask you to put that machine away  well be laying for tea in a minute of course  is everything ready for the servants tea  oh is it just me or do we have twice the bills we used to  ivy this is for you  did you find those oyster shells for the kettle  ive put them in about time it were full of scale  what in gods name was that about  dont rise to it she just wants us to think her lifes interesting  anything interesting im reading about county politics  theyre looking for candidates for the local council  why dont you put yourself forward  but what are my politics these days im not sure  you could always read a bit about it  you wont find many books on the liberal ideals in this room  and nothing at all about socialism  if youre serious about driving me to thirsk tomorrow  perhaps we might find some then  are you better now granny  if youd been to see me youd know  dont bully me im not up to it  no rosamund told me  when what did she say  only that you needed a little cherishing thats all  so mr drewes accepted your officer  im so pleased  the drewes have been at yew tree farm for many years  i suppose you think thats sentimental bosh mr blake  dont be too hard on him granny  mr blake has a softer side than we first gave him credit for  im relieved to hear i am redeemed before we leave for london  i hope im forgiven too  i know you thought me very snobbish when you first arrived  i dont blame you given my work i came as an envoy of the enemy  are we too early bring them in nanny  i dont think anyone will mind  your papa might but he isnt here to complain  one moment darling while mummy puts away her cup  oh here let me hello there  oh its all right  hes turning into quite a bruiser  yes and i must go stay and have some dinner mama  you neednt change no thank you my dear but no  you should change and i should go  when you go down can you give a message to mrs hughes  of course  lord gillingham telephoned today  he wants to break his journey home  tomorrow night  hell be here again  youre right i shouldnt encourage him  but i couldnt think what to say to persuade him not to  do you think me very feeble  its not that mlady  then what is it  anna  its nothing to bother you with please bother me  if i did youd have to promise to do nothing about it  but how does this concern lord gillingham  it doesnt mlady its nothing to do with lord gillingham himself  but then its his man mlady  his servant mr green who travels with him  oh my god  but the police ought to  no  i must tell lord gillingham no mlady you promised  mr bates doesnt know it was him  but the more he comes here  the more likely it is that mr bates will find out  then ill telephone him and tell him not to come or not to bring green  im frightened every time mr green and mr bates are in the same room  you think if he guesses hell do something  and if he does theyll hang him  or lock him up and throw away the key  jimmy the savouries can go in and daisyll bring up the sauce  and now perhaps you can explain why  you have apparently been under hypnosis since dinner began  i dont know what you mean yes you do  mooning about like a sloth under water  well  you know i had a letter earlier  it were from alfred it seems his father died  and alfreds coming up for the funeral  oh i am sorry thats not all  he says he wants to marry me  what just like that  he says the way i behaved towards him when he were last here  made him hope that things had changed between us  well you were very friendly thats not all  he wants me to leave downton and go up to london  he says he can find me a job blimey  he puts a lot in a letter does alfred  theyre serving the savouries well talk about it later  now er put the water on for the coffee  thats enough for one day surely you can finish them tomorrow  shall we walk back to the cottage the others are going to bed  what were you saying to mrs hughes  just that lord gillinghams asked himself for the night again  he cant stay away  yes its a bit of a tangle  do you think shes sweet on him  theyre sweet on each other but its not as simple as that is it  then theres mr blake i thought she didnt like him  she didnt at first  anyway they can sort it out between them  and mr green  hell be coming back  have you gone off him  why do you say that  you liked him so much when he first came  you thought he was funny did i  i cant remember  so youre pleased with mr drewe  i am and im very pleased with the pigs too theyre a grand addition  when theyve settled you ought to consider dairy  another job for the splendid mr drewe  i think he is rather splendid  he seems to want to make farming at downton his lifes work  thats very lyrical  lady rosamund painswick is on the telephone mlady  do you have anything planned for today  some shopping thats all  do you think i should write and give him my answer  if youre sure about it i dont want to marry alfred  then theres no more to be said  even if i did i wouldnt care to tie myself down yet  how do i know what life has in store  youre a very optimistic generation ill say that  what are you talking about nothing  i wish youd say cos its clear as day youre up to something  none of us know when papas coming back  but yes we must tell her before then  in fact ive had an idea  well if youre sure then why not  weve already got friends of mary staying ring with the train time  byebye dear  who was that aunt rosamund  shes coming to see how granny is why are you down so early  ive got to check some figures with tom before he goes into thirsk  quite the businesswoman  we must rise to lifes challenges  yes i suppose we must  lets meet in the book shop in ten minutes  ive got some letters to post ill see you there  thank you  good day  dont dont do that  you mustnt be so selfconscious  a black singer with the daughter of a marquess in a yorkshire town  why should we attract any attention well thats their problem  it doesnt have to be ours  im terribly puffed that you made the journey  me too but but what  i hope were brave enough for this of course we are  isnt it time people knew there are bigger and better values  than the meanspirited ones they live by  does lady grantham know youre out for the day  it wont matter as long as im back for dinner  are you playing tonight i wouldnt be here if i were  i can stay for as long as you want  well i want you to stay forever but six oclock will do  youre not very talkative whats the matter  i was thinking about a couple of people  who are in a situation which will cause trouble  will it make them unhappy  its hard to say  itll make some people unhappy  i thought i might make some coffee would you like a cup  no thank you  its just coffee you wont have to surrender any of your independence  er you win  er milk but no sugar  miss baxter  i do know what its like to feel fragile  ive felt fragile my whole life  youll have realised by now that down here  we dont much care for mr barrow which may offend you  im notoffended  but i wish youd give us credit for making up our own minds about you  hello  this is miss bunting sarah bunting  and this is mrs crawley  i met miss bunting at the political meeting you sent me to in ripon  ah so that was the reason why do you say that  he wasnt exactly enthralled to the cause of the liberals  though im not now convinced by his socialism why not  i didnt know then that you were the land agent and soninlaw  of our local milord im surprised im so famous  wont you defend your principles  no not now  then i will mr branson is a keen political thinker  he proves this by not being afraid to question his own beliefs  very eloquent id stay to argue but im late  do you live around here  i work here  at the school  it was nice to see you again  hello miss hello  she knows her own mind yes i think she does  apparently he left the dalrymples straight after breakfast  so i missed him when i telephoned  you did your best i am so sorry  come in  no tails you know grannys coming  oh god is she i didnt realise  no dont change its time she learned about the real world  a phrase with more than one definition  can i have a word  ive seen something  and im not saying theres anything wrong about it  but id feel uncomfortable if i kept it to myself  im all ears  this morning in thirsk i saw rose  yes she was shopping  no she was not shopping  she wasmeeting a man  i saw her as she reached up to stroke his cheek  oh golly who is it this time  it was jack ross  the singer with the band  who came up for your fathers party  well thats it ive told you and i have nothing more to add  anna  shes told you then  dont give me away mrs hughes please  i can get through it  my maid said you were waiting in here  everyone else is in the drawing room  i know but i thought youd want to hear  i think i know how i can keep the baby  what how  theres a tenant farmer  whose family has been at downton for years im sure he can be trusted  this is very reckless  well what would you suggest  id suggest that we go away  you and me on an extended trip tosomewhere  then the baby can be adopted by a childless couple in that country  wherever it may be and they are made very happy  and the baby is happy and you are  well if not happy at least free  but i wouldnt be part of its growing up  you wouldnt be part of its life  why is my idea so reckless  oh my dear where shall i start  suppose the farmer talks  suppose youre seen visiting his home  which i presume is the idea  suppose the baby looks like you and people in the village notice  suppose you talk  i left a list somewhere that i need for mrs patmore  you know lord gillingham is here  er yes we were just chatting were coming now  im desperately trying to take control of the bazaar  talk about herding cats ill stay and help if you want  you may regret saying that  and while im here we can discuss a plan that id like to get settled  ive always wanted to speak better french than i do  so i thought id take a few months off go toswitzerland  and really learn it i see not france  you know what the french are like  while switzerland is so clean  and they have wonderful hospitals in case we get ill  we i wondered if edith might like to come keep me company  ill pay  what do you have to say about that  id like to  goodness oh wellwhy not  golly life is full of surprises  but id better check to see that the young men are keeping the peace  so we wont have to tell her  i dont think we need to do you  can you really afford to spend four months reading novels in the alps  why ask the question when the decision has been made  come on we ought to join the others  have you been wandering round scotland since we saw you  i have i was on the spey  i did a tour of the cousinage then a wedding in ayrshire  ive enjoyed myself it gave me time to think for once  oh what about particularly  my life i suppose  everyone should from time to time  oh i cant agree in my experience its a dangerous occupation  dangerous well no life appears rewarding  if you think too much about it  i gather youve launched into pigs these days  yes and their arrival was quite the adventure  in which mr blake and mary were the hero and heroine  is this what you wouldnt tell me when i was last here  only because i didnt want to make too much of it  lady mary was perfectly splendid lady mary is perfectly splendid  really charles are you a pig expert as well  he was that night thank heaven  rosamund and edith have some exciting news  whats that  were going on a sabbatical so we can really improve our french  the only thing i ever learned from my governess was how to say  please thank you and i have a temperature  very useful if one were travelling  do you remember her mama she was always in tears  oh poor mademoiselle her life was full of complications  i think she quite enjoyed it though  but why you you dont want to learn french  or is this an incognito search for the missing mr gregson  dont tease her its much more serious than that  thank you tom  if you must know i fancy getting away for a bit  oh like lord gillingham  thinking his way around the highlands  i like scotland me at least i would if id ever been there  well ive had a bellyful of heather and no mistake  arent you going to fight back mrs hughes  mr green can think what he likes  so youre glad youre on your way to london  itll be all i can do to stop singing when i get in the car  where do you live when youre there his lordships got a set at albany  is that handy for the west end youre joking  piccadilly one end saville row the other  oh you lucky tyke i am a lucky tyke  do you like london miss baxter not particularly  i lived there at one time but it didnt work for me  what about you anna do you fancy a taste of mr greens life  im happy where i am thank you  rose was badgering me about going up to london again  but shes been enough lately dont you think i certainly do  after all shes got to have some novelty when we bring her out  quite right she can help with the bazaar  thatll take her mind off things  trouble is parenting an adult   especially when its someone elses daughter   is really a matter of mutual agreement  theres a limit to how much one can simply forbid  sshh here she is actually i want a word with her  rose darling can i drag you into my room for a moment  anna could you leave us for a minute  of course  this is early for you to go to bed i had rather a tiring day  so i heard  well i heard you had an interesting day  whether or not it was tiring you know better than i  who told you  my dear all i want is for you not to lose control of your life  i love him  and i wont listen to any imperialist nonsense  about racial purity  and how he should be horsewhipped for daring to dream  dont you know me better than that  im going to marry him mary  i dont care what it costs and i wont keep it a secret  not once ive told mummy  i want to see her face crumble when she finds out  rose  i feel were driving you away  oh hardly were in grave danger of outstaying our welcome  if tony hadnt offered us a lift wed be here forever  i hope youll be back soon good luck with your bazaar  cant you stay and lend me a hand dont tempt me  im so grateful for your advice and wisdom  and not least for the very practical and muddy pig rescue  glad to be of service mlady  are you going straight there we might stop for some lunch  its kind of you to give them a lift  pure self interest i couldnt leave charles here alone with you  will you let me see you when youre next down south  what would be the point tony  im never going to be your mistress  thats not me at all  ive made up my mind to call off the engagement  does mabel know not yet  i havent been in london since and i must tell her face to face  of course you must but i wish youd think seriously before you do  you mean youre going to turn me down again  ive told you im not on the market tony  im not free  sometimes i almost wish i were but im not  and thats all there is to it  oh you have been incredibly kind to put up with us for so long  well miss you the house will seem rather empty  if it were my choice i should never be away from here  can i ask you one thing how do you feel about your man  im still not very keen on him why  wed better get started so this really is goodbye  not for long i hope  you took the words right out of my mouth  im sorry to see them go not as sorry as mary  whats a group noun for suitors  what do you think a desire  a desire of suitors very good  if youre going to talk nonsense i have better things to do  ive posted the letter well hell probably still come  hes got to be in yorkshire for the funeral whatever you said  whatever she said to who  oh just tell me i know youve got a secret  and if youre trying to spare my feelings its not working  alfreds written  his fathers died so hes coming for the burial  he wants to look in and see us all see us all or see her  alfreds asked me to marry him but shes turned him down  so his hearts broken properly this time are you satisfied now  why dont we leave the subject there we dont want to fall out  we cant fall out weve never fallen in  so they got off in good order  i wonder how long itll take for them all to propose to mary  isnt lord gillingham engaged  hes supposed to be but he still seems as keen as mustard  well that is very interesting  but its not why i asked you here  oh no  i want to know what you were doing at downton  i dont understand  why shouldnt i come to downton i grew up here  i see ill have to take the slow path  you telephone to say edith is to be cherished  but you dont say why  didnt i no  next you invite yourself to downton and reveal at dinner  that you and edith are retreating to the continent for several months  so you can improve your french yes  rosamund has no interest in french  if she wishes to be understood by a foreigner she shouts  thats not fair  isnt it time one of you told me the truth  if i told you the truth granny you would never speak to me again  then you have told me the truth  but i would like to hear it enunciated more clearly  right now we must all look lively  theyre starting to set up the stalls for the bazaar today  and her ladyship will need all hands on deck  james mr molesley if you could both keep an eye on things  do we get paid extra no  but if you play your cards right youll avoid a clip round the ear  ill ask mrs patmore for some refreshment for the village people  this is an early warning that theyre coming to set up the stalls for saturday  so wed better have sandwiches and beer at the ready  as i feared alfreds looking in on saturday on his way back to london  so hell be here for the bazaar  he does know theres no hope with ivy  well thats why hes written to me but he says he wants to see her  its not going to be very easy for daisy  i thought id give her the day off you wont mind will you  if you think it best its you wholl do the extra work not me  what a nightmare  the man selling ices is ill so ive got to find another  the grocers from easingwold and malton cant be side by side  and ive got to decide the house menus with mrs patmore  ill do that tend to the bazaar  are you sure because if you are im sure  whens cousin robert coming back i dont know i wish i did  weve had no word from him in days  what is it  ive got to tell someone or ill just explode  tell someone what oh mary  what do you think  im engaged  but what was so urgent  first can you join me for luncheon today  well i suppose so i ought to go back and tell mrs field why  ive got lord merton coming  marys godfather  mm it was fixed years ago but now roberts off on his travels  cora is too busy and marys chucked  for what reason suddenly she has to be in london  i think rosamunds still here oh no she cant stand him  i could ask edith she might be free  oh i hope so  im a feeble substitute for the entire crawley family  mmm yes but youre better than nothing  how warming you make that sound  oh im ever so glad to find you can you help me do these  whats the rush  lady mary has to go to london  why im not sure  but she wants me to go with her of course  when will you be back tomorrow evening but well be late  its not fair  i stop you going to new york and then i set off for london  dont be silly  come in  mr carson id like to go into york tomorrow i hope you dont mind  youve got no duties here why should i mind  ill set off first thing if youve no objection  be my guest mr bates  i still dont understand why youre not in new york  so i can hardly object to york  enjoy yourself  very good well done ladies  can i have a go its not ready yet  anyway youre a bit of a shrimp arent you  im a shrimp with muscles me  well find that out on saturday  ive never had a go on one of those its not your sort of thing  more sandwiches and more beer its like a plague of locusts  busy mr molesley i like the bazaar  i always enjoy it i hope you will  cant you help her to mr molesley  oh get off with you you cheeky devil  alfreds coming saturday int he how do you know that  i heard you and mrs hughes talking well i i were going to mention it  because i wondered if youd rather be away  what about all the work oh its mostly done by then  if youd rather avoid him i wont mind  could i go and see mr mason  thats a good idea  stay away as late as you like just to be safe  but why the urgency  i cant explain but i swear if you knew youd approve  what this whats happened mary has to go to london  its no big thing ill be back tomorrow night  can i come no  well why not because mama needs you here  goodbye then bye rose  do you want to stay at the house ill telephone if you do  could you youre an angel  i told mead he could visit his sister in swindon  but theyll do the best they can thank you  how mysterious  is anything wrong  the cars packed in my friends gone for help  would you like me to have a look i dont want to hold you up  ive no appointment i was on my way to skipton  to see some suppliers and compare prices  how impressive  i thought that when the agent was a cousin or soninlaw  he had free shooting for life but others did the work  to quote my wifes grandmother  youve been reading socialist newspapers again  you should know  is this wise  youve heard some of my story but not all of it  i came to downton to be the chauffeur  now  that was a splendid luncheon  quite a change for me oh i cant believe that  its true i eat nothing but nursery food  perhaps you need a new cook its not her fault  i never know what to order  a husband is told so often hes going to die first  you never think youre going to have to manage on your own  i doubt doctor crawley would have managed any better  im so interested he was a doctor  i wanted to study medicine myself but my father didnt really  didnt see it as a profession for a gentleman  i dont believe hed have gone that far  but he didnt think it quite suitable for a peer no  i must try and find an example to rebut that  well i must be going  let me take you my cars outside  i can easily walk  id like to please  thenthank you  i should go too granny  no stay  i want to speak to you  so were you still the chauffeur when you married  thats a long story  everything with yous a long story  that one had a happy ending  for a time anyway  i know she died  im so sorry  she must have been a very unusual and independent person  you could say that again  its nice that they asked you to stay to make your life here  i have a little daughter and it seemed the right thing  still it makes me take a kinder view of the family  oh what do you have against them  nothing  but as a rule i dont really warm to their type  i dont believe in types  i believe in people  now give it a try  i really am very grateful thank you  i dont often say it  but rosamund is right  i do not know this mrmr drewe  but even if he is everything you say  to keep the child here  would be like a permanent sword of damocles inches from your head  but i cant bear the thought of giving it away  and is it right that it should grow up swiss  well switzerland has everything to offer  except perhaps conversation  and one can learn to live without that  and if michael turns up  well if you want my advice start again  now i will pay for everything  aunt rosamund said she would  youll be quite enough in her debt as it is  take any more  and shell start exacting annual tribute  what do your sons do i assume they do something  remember i met larry at that dinner  ah dont remind me  they do work  larrys in banking and tims in the diplomatic  so nothing very startling there what about yours  matthew was a lawyer  oh has he given it up  hes  hes dead  i thought you would know that  oh good god  im terribly sorry i id forgotten for a moment who you were  dont worry please  how is mary i do wish i could have seen her today  well slow to start with but now shes on her way which im glad of  i heard they were well suited yes  they were happy which makes the parting worse  but gives you strength in the end as we know  you maybe not me  lady merton and i were not exactly meant to be together  we struggled on of course as everyone did in those days  but im not sure now how sensible it was  i envy you your wonderful memories but i cant pretend to match them  is mr ross here yet  who shall i say is calling roses cousin   dadadadada   dadadada   dabadabada   dadadada   dadadada   dadadeedeedee   dadadada   dada   lady mary huh  i was wondering if it would be you  how did you know someone was coming  rose telephoned  she said shed told you we were about to set the date  i just made some tea would you like a cup  thank you  i suppose youre here to say that lord flintshire  would find the prospect of a black soninlaw preposterous  and your father would agree  to be fair to papa hed find your being a band singer  even harder to swallow than your colour  mr ross are you sure about this  marriage is a challenge even when everyone wants it  even if everyone prays youll be happy  you mean in our case theyll all be trying to pull us apart  every hour of every day  tell me do you think she loves you  dont you believe in us  i believe in you im not so sure about her  she may love you a bit but mostly id say  she wants to shock her mother whom incidentally she hates  thats what my mother said  she said rose must be proving some point  you and my mother have a lot in common  tell me honestly do you think you can survive what theyll do to you  because i dont believe rose could  it may come as something of a relief for you to hear that  i will not be marrying rose  you wont no  ive enjoyed her dreams  i think shes more than you allow  but  i dont want to spoil her life  i dont want to watch while people point at her and jeer  i love her  i want her to be happy  so youll end it  yes  i should probably have stopped it sooner but at any rate  im stopping it now  so will you tell rose or shall i ill tell her  ill write to her  shell get it tomorrow  it doesnt mean i think its right  i wouldnt give in if we lived in even a slightly better world  it may surprise you mr ross  but if we lived in a better world i wouldnt want you to  ive been downstairs mlady theyre making dinner for you now  i dont want a lot ive told them that  how are you  much as i was yesterday  much as i will be tomorrow  anna  ive decided to see lord gillingham  im sorry but i must do something  ill telephone and suggest we meet for luncheon  then ill ask him straight out to dismiss his valet  i wont say why  that makes me so nervous dont be  noone needs to know the reason  green simply wont be back at downton again  is bates going to challenge lord gillingham  as to why he has a different valet  i suppose not  so you have nothing to fear if he pays us a visit  and will he mlady  er dinners on the table mlady  im not sure mead would have put it like that but thank you  so we decorate the stalls today you all know the drill  and remember  anything shabby shows downton in a bad light  and we cant have that no mrs hughes we cant  will you come  itll give you a chance to meet a few people from the village  is it not just the estate workers oh no no  the whole area gets behind the church bazaar  youre very lucky you know  nobodys ever called me that least of all myself  to grow up in a village where people know and like you  where your familys respected plenty would give an eye for that  im not used to feeling lucky  well you should be  are we trying for a colour scheme  goodness i thought id be down before anyone  oh no this is one task that demands an early start  the tents up for the tea theyre fetching tables and chairs from the barn  dont let them mess up the grass when they drive them back  rose one two three lift  oh i can manage  rose should you be doing this  why what are you afraid of that ill lose the baby  so theyve made you a beast of burden now  thats right and theyre not taking advantage  are they ready for these give me those james  could you take these to the tent please  may i present miss bunting  she teaches at the village school im very interested in the school  you know lady grantham  of course its nice to meet you  but im afraid i must get on  so thats the great countess of grantham  it is another beast of burden  ill sack him if you insist but tell me why its only fair  i dont know if its fair or unfair but i cant  not even a hint ive said what i can  hes done something youd findabhorrent  well you win  but it does seem mean even if i dont like him very much  you wouldnt think it mean if you knew the truth  well i believe you  i love you and i believe you  have you spoken to mabel  i have but i wasnt going to bring it up  why not i dont want to twist your arm  and i know that you wont make a decision until it suits you  how did she take it im so pleased you asked  i think the answer is with real style  well im glad  and now can you get the bill im terribly late  i must catch the last train its the church bazaar tomorrow  i wont give up mary  not until you walk down the aisle with another man  and very possibly not even then  i find that both irritating and beguiling in equal measure  should i take comfort from that take what you like  im going  and do what i ask with green  and please let me know when youve done it  you sent for me  i wouldnt put it like that  i just wondered if you might be free  oh your wish is my command  these came this morning from lord merton as a thank you  that was kind of him but what part do i play in it  theyre for you  for me surely not  yes he sent me some too these came with them  i read the card  he asks forgiveness for his tactlessness  was he tactless he didnt mean to be tactless  how nice mmm  very nice  quitequite surprising but very nice  im just going up to see if they need anything more  can you leave these for one of the hall boys  ill do them mr carson i dont mind  you took your time in york  yes it was quite a long day  what were you up to oh this and that  one two three go  lovely to see you again thank you very much  you got his letter then  youre so disappointing mary  i thought you understood and youre just like my mother  no im not but i understand this   if youre going to complicate your life do it for the right reasons  james im putting the tea tent in your charge  make sure they dont run out of anything  but her ladyship said we were to enjoy ourselves  let us consider this  she wants you to enjoy yourself i want you to run the tent  now which of us can make your life more uncomfortable  mr molesley  mr molesley mr molesley  tell those people where theyre supposed to park  wait a minute its his lordship his lordships back  tell the others his lordships back  james  how can you be here  why didnt you send a message  we would have made such a fuss youre a beast  oh not quite a beast i hope  i wanted to surprise you and i think i have  papa you should have let us know when did you get in  this morning id forgotten about the bazaar  i was right not to distract you all from your labours  what happened to uncle harold a reprimand but nothing more  so it was worth your going  i dont think i made a bit of difference but lets hold on to that fiction  how was it interesting  very modernand very interesting  hows it been here  not very interesting and not very modern  carson hello bates have you missed me  because ive certainly missed you  good to see you back mlord  youre back  i cant believe it  if you knew how many times id imagined this scene  this is a treat its been a while  im sorry if ive stayed away  nay no apologies not from you not here  youre my daughterinlaw  youre all that ive got left of my son  whether you come here or not this is your home  i do love it when i come im glad  thats it  oh there you are alfred nice to see you have a glass of this  is ivy about im just here  thank you  how was the funeral was well attended  so thats something for my mother to hold on to  i read your letter  im sorry if i hurt your feelings no im sorry  i got the wrong end of the stick when i were last up here  but it were my mistake  all you did wastry and give me a nice welcome  and you cant feel sorry for that  we can part as friends  we can as far as im concerned  is daisy here  i wanted to see if she and i could be friends an all before i go  shes gone to mr masons farm for the day  she wont be back till late oh  daisy are you here to avoid seeing alfred  ivys turned him down again so he wont come back after today  what does mrs patmore say about it  to stay away so i dont meet him  i would advise against that but why  i thought youd be glad if i stayed a bit longer  i wish youd stay and never leave and i hope you will one day  but mrs patmores wrong  daisy there wont be too many people that you love in your life  and hes one  i dont know what i feel about him not now  even so you need to say goodbye to this young man  with nothing jagged  nothing harsh between you  i couldnt think of the words  well find them together  and er well get you back to downton in time  are you bearing up  in here  im never going to see michael again am i  if you want to go out there and look for him ill support you  theyve already done all that  police and private detectives and everything  well then you must be patient  sometimes i feel that god doesnt want me to be happy  my dear all life is a series of problems  which we must try and solve  first one then the next and the next  until at last we die  why dont you get us an ice cream  yes that should sort it out  isnt that lord gillingham what it cant be where  what does miss lane fox think about it thats what i wonder  i agree hes the most unconvincing fiance ive ever come across  perhaps she doesnt know  if we know she knows you can count on that  green but how could he be dead  im only telling you what they told me  that he was in piccadilly and he  slipped or stumbled and fell into the road  i dont know what to say  it just seemed so odd after our conversation yesterday  that i felt that i should bring you the news myself  can you explain to me now why you wanted him sacked  no  hello tony heavens  what a gathering of the clans todays turning out to be  would you excuse me for a moment  i dont suppose its a good sign to find you back at downton  not really not this time  you mean he fell into the road and he was hit yesterday  by a bus or lorry apparently  and someone saw this  the pavement was crowded lots of people saw it  thats a relief what do you mean  nothing i dont mean anything  mary  did your mother warn you i was coming  she did  why are you back in yorkshire so soon  id no sooner got back than i was despatched to a tenant farmers convention in whitby  but its over now so ill go home from here  can i ask you something of course  its an odd question go on  if you thought a man was involved in a crime or an incident  but you didnt blame him  in fact you thought right was on his side  what would you do  its a bit theoretical for an opinion  but you dont believe he was wrong no  well im guessing in the dark buti suspect i would say nothing  that isnt fair its weighted  go on you have a go mr molesley  no no i wont manage it if jimmy cant  try i want to see it  well done  that was cheating  well itits in the arms  its all to do with the swing and the swing is in the arms  so miss baxter  anything to tell me about life since ive been away  no nothings happened  ill find out if it has you know  leave her alone mr barrow  we dont want any bullying brought back from overseas  do we miss baxter  now are there any stalls youd still like to see  god what a relief to be able to drink in public  without a policeman pouncing down with prohibition  you cant mean you never had a drink all the time you were there  harold has his uses  i suppose he does  and let us hope they both leave us in peace  a slim hope im afraid  martha wants to bring him over next summer for roses coming out ball  why  she says she wants to see another london season before she dies  oh  youre still here thank goodness  i caught an early bus but it was delayed i thought id missed you  im off to the station now daisy  and i wont be back  my dads gone and mothers moving to crewe to be nearer my sister  so im glad youre here to say goodbye i really am  ive brought you a present  mr masons made you a basket full of things  rolls and cheese and ham and jams and pickles  and hes put some cider in too to keep you going on the train home  that was kind of him daisy are you sure it wasnt meant for you  no he did it for alfred  i told him we were old friends so he did it for you  you know ivy turned me down i do yes  i think ive been a bit blind where shes concerned  love is blind  maybe but i wonder now ive not been a fool  youve always been so good to me daisy so true  but i could never see it  thats kind of you to say and good to hear  i loved you alfred ill not deny it  but thats done with now and what i felt wont come back  its time for you to go your way and me to go mine  but you wish me well oh i do alfred yeah  so well so very well  friends forever  friends forever daisy  right now this really is goodbye  are you all right daisy  ill just get this off and pop in the pantry for my apron  well thats that then  do you know when you brought up that basket  i were so proud of you i felt like crying out  if you were my own daughter  i couldnt be prouder than i am now  you do know why i came today to see the bazaar  to see you  i find  perhaps to my surprise  that since i left  i cant think of anything but you  to your surprise and my surprise  im only asking for a chance  was there really a conference in whitby  of course not  im flattered charles and even moved  but rather than add to the list of men ive disappointed  it might be kinder to refuse you now and let you off the hook  hmm im afraid i couldnt allow that  not without putting up a fight  what are you still doing here  i wish i knew what you were up to yesterday  why did you go i wanted to get away  youd never do anything foolish would you  youd never risk everything weve built together  certainly not you know me  when i do a thing i like to have a very good reason for doing it  where have you two been hiding  in plain view where all good tricksters hide  look what ive found tom will you see  if there are some clean glasses on that table  well done my dear a real triumph  i hope so  ive told them they can clear up the rest tomorrow  i thought that was the best bazaar ive known here  certainly at least since your father and i were running it  and now as the prodigal husband home from the sea  let me raise a glass to my extraordinary wife  who can clearly manage far better in my absence cora  lady grantham cora mama  very well done lady grantham and now im afraid i should be going  it was so kind of you to come  i dont suppose i could ask you for a lift this time i came by train  but id much rather drive certainly  ill see you off  what sort of menage has that turned into while ive been away
