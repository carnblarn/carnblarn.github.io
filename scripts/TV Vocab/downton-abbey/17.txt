                  who will groan first when they see it granny or papa  i should think theyll howl at the moon in unison  what in gods name is this  well i never where did this come from  i ordered it in london picked it up on the way back  its an ac well at least its english  welcome back my darling  how was the honeymoon my eyes have been opened dont i know it  anna get back all right yes  whos that for why are you doing it down here  its for mr matthew it was creased im ironing it  youre never looking after him what about mr molesley  hes staying at crawley house why wasnt i asked  mr carson thought it best did he i wonder how that came about  if youre learning your job never open a shirt in a room  where it might be marked let alone put studs in it  do that in a dressing room and nowhere else thank you  yes youre always trying to be so very helpful  how did you enjoy the south of france it was lovely  but almost too hot even now  its a shame they close things in the summer i love the sun  so we can see you couldnt be in cannes in summer its unbearable  i could just how long is she here for  who knows no guest should be admitted  with no departure date settled  you wont get any argument from me  theres a hideous pile of post ive put it on the hall table  dont look at it tonight what have you been up to  ive found myself a new occupation  but violet doesnt think its appropriate  can we talk about it afterwards  are there still forbidden subjects in 1920 i cant believe this  i speak of taste rather than law  well its not my taste  what about you cora i agree with mama  some subjects are not suitable for every ear  oh pas devant les domestiques  come on my dear carson and alfred  know more about life than we ever will  cant we stop this how shes like a runaway train  shall we go through  what about poor old strallan have you seen him  why do you call him poor or old hes neither  isnt it dangerous to let this strallan nonsense simmer on  to be fair i dont think its coming from him ask him to end it  hell be more effective than if we try  ooh she ate it then  never sure about americans and offal  shell eat whatever you put in front of her what a gob  mr carson was going to put a bag over her head  oops mrs levinson knows you make fun of her  because she makes fun of you were all square then  its not drying properly the ovens not hot enough  a bad workman always blames his tools  are you busy no were eating in half an hour but its all done  well if you could spare a minute  this is very good you didnt open it for me certainly i did  to welcome you into this house as my son  i cant tell you how glad it makes me  i want us always to feel we can be honest with each other  of course because marys told me about your present difficulties  oh she was right  losing downton will affect you both more than anyone  has she told you about the will of lavinias father  yes your father told me all about it  but i cannot understand why so much money was put into one company  i couldnt agree more now were to be turned out of downton  even lloyd george cant want that  im not sure hes a good example  the point is have we overlooked something  some source of revenue previously untapped  if only we had some coal or gravel or tin  i can think of someone whos got plenty of tin  so you help women who have fallen over  not quite isabelle helps women who have to degrade themselves  to survive theres a centre in york  no addresses please alfred will make notes  what do you do for these women first we like to send them away  to rest i should think they need it  and then we try to find them alternative employment  the war destroyed many households thousands of bread winners died  so you want me to contribute  you dont have to give money after every conversation no  isnt that what the english expect of rich americans  why cant you benefit from the will youve done nothing wrong  he didnt know id broken his daughters heart  it was to reward my fidelity  when in fact id betrayed her  if i kept that money id be no better than a common criminal  i see  if thats how you feel theres no more to be said  im ever so sorry my lord i thought you were out of here  we should be please were going now  its a lump theres no point dithering about that  what are you going to do about it i dont know  tomorrow youll make an appointment with the doctor and see what he says  but what if its if it is and im not saying it is  its best to know now  i suppose so  now look youll not be alone for a minute if you dont want to be  but we have to get it seen to  then theres expense  if you must pay money better to a doctor than an undertaker  if thats an example of your bedside manner mrs patmore  i think id sooner face it alone  it seems shocking for anna to find me en deshabille  im made of stout stuff sir dont worry about that  are you seeing bates today i am and i cant wait  give him our best wishes  it still seems odd to be found in your bed  but very nice oh as nice as nice can be  im going to see jarvis today  and find out what houses are available do you have to  these are our last days here i thought something mightve turned up  while we were away but it seems it hasnt  would you rather wait till we have to go and find a new house then  after all darling youre the one whos pushing us out  not for me thank you  but marys only just got back from honeymoon  its her family time but you are  stop saying im family when im not  ill be there for the big dinner next week  what is it i know you dont mean to hurt me but  of course i dont thats the last thing id wish to do  then why do you shove me away i dont want to not at all but  if youre going to talk about your wretched arm again i wont listen  its not just my arm im too old for you  you need a young chap with his life ahead of him  your lifes ahead of you if you knew how much i want to believe that  then its settled  youre not going to push me away any more  and you are coming for dinner tonight thats all there is to it  how did you get on with veras book  i had a few answers waiting for me when i got back  and two returned address unknown  who from let me see one was a mr harlip i think  and the other was mrs bartlett  he doesnt matter he was a cousin in the north she never saw him  but mrs bartletts a shame  she lived on the corner she was very friendly ill find her  tell me about france  did you eat frogs legs and dance the cancan  no but i bought a garter  youve had no other symptoms  not that im aware of  youre not feeling ill or tired  i cant swear to not feeling tired  but nothing out of the ordinary  very well  im going to conduct a preliminary examination  do you mind if i stay  i should prefer it  what have you got there mr matthews tailcoat  what do you think that is hard to say  ive tried everything but i cant shift it  ill give you a tip if you like would you really yeah  keep it to yourself dont want to give away all my secrets  oh there you are my dear good morning granny  ive been looking for you  now i want to know if were serious  about getting that woman about asking your other grandmother  to come to our aid shes made of money  and theres only mama and uncle harold to share it when shes gone  we cant wait that long shell bury us all  no we must act now  we must make her feel it is her duty to save downton  but how what can we do get her to sense its value  its vital role in the area  youre her granddaughter  this will be your house if it survives  surely you can make something of that if she has a heart at all  well come for tea this afternoon  then we can begin  there are several stages to go through before a cause for despair  what stages when you come back in a day or two  ill remove fluid from the cyst  with luck itll be clear and that will be that  how will you do it with a syringe  will it hurt since he has to do it whether it hurts or not  theres no point to that question  what i want to know is what happens if the fluid is not clear  itll be sent away for analysis because it may be cancer  it may be cancer but im fairly certain it is not  there you are its very very unlikely isnt it doctor  if the doctor treats me like an adult  why do insist on treating me like a child  does this seem slow to you not really  mrs levinsons going to the dower house with the others for tea  i think he likes me  hes being friendly thats all  are you all right you seem to have been slaving away for hours  i want to be up to date before i get back to the office  anything from mr swires lawyer  you can read it if you like  so you are definitely reggies heir  looks like it but if they have to get a death certificate  out of the indian authorities it wont be settled by tuesday good  why is it good the delay may give you time to change your mind  stop punishing me mary please  if i accepted the legacy id take money under false pretences  id be stealing your father understands now why cant you  he doesnt understand he just doesnt want to beg  anyway im off to grannys for tea see you later  i do love you so terribly much  yes i know you do  so whats harold doing now  his idee fixe is yachts  bigger yachts faster yachts  something with yachts  is he happy hes much too busy to find out  it always seems so strange to me that cora has a brother why  if theres a boy the daughters dont get anything  theres no such thing as an english heiress with a brother  why do we never see him  harold hates to leave america  curious he hates to leave america  i should hate to go there  you dont mean that granny  when were both so drawn to america  indeed indeed we are never more than now  when the bond between the crawleys and levinsons is so strong  thats nice if you mean it mama  i do  it is marvellous the way our families support each other  you mean you needed the levinson cash to keep the crawleys on top  im not sure wed put it that way  im quite sure we would not but i hope you feel mamas fortune  has been well spent in shoring up an ancient family hm  you gotta spend it on something  what happened here i  i just  you just what there was a mark i know there was a mark  but you didnt need to burn it away what have you done  ill go down in my dinner jacket send it to my tailor in the morning  come on nobodys died just find the dinner jacket  there dont seem to be any glasses for the pudding wine  are they having one tonight its on the menus  i dont write them for my own amusement i dare say not  i am trying and so far failing  to persuade his lordship to bring the staff levels back up to snuff  but until he does it is vital that you pull your weight  newports not a jungle not at all  but it is a little less formal  matthew obviously wants you to feel at home in his play clothes  dont blame me alfred and i had a disaster earlier  what happened he managed to burn a hole in my tails  dont worry it can be mended careful carson  i beg your pardon my lord  i like dinner jackets sometimes its nice to be informal  especially when a couple is alone  people like us should lead the fight to keep tradition going  if you mean we can never change i cant agree nor me  accepting change is as important as defending the past  the role of houses like downton is to protect tradition  thats why theyre so important to maintain dont you agree  we must do everything in our power to keep downton going sure  if you think its worth it whos coming to dinner next week  locals we thought youd like to see downton on parade  thats right im glad weve planned a dinner  we can show you the real point of downton  i dont know what to say mr carson  whats going on here alfred has embarrassed the family  he forced mr matthew to appear downstairs improperly dressed  you make it sound quite exciting i will not tolerate vulgarity  im sure alfred didnt mean to hm  i asked thomas hey whats this the stuff you gave me  burned a hole in the tails i gave you some soda crystals  if you use them wrongly its not my fault  this is what comes of making him run before he could walk  if you want me to stay away from her i will  i know it sounds harsh  please i understand completely  ediths your daughter you dont want her seeing an old cripple  now youre the one whos harsh  the trouble is she calls round regularly  i can hardly ask her not to be admitted  i suppose i could write to her  i hope you wont feel we cant be friends after this  lets leave it for a while ill duck out of the dinner next week  it might be best thank you  thats the one you shouldve taken soda crystals  but he didnt give me that he pointed to this one i promise  you dont have to promise i believe you  so you think hes not ready  hes just a lad my lord  he can see to the odd visitor but permanent valet to mr matthew  its too much im pretty sure mr crawleyd rather manage on his own  they wouldnt like that downstairs my lord  i was afraid youd say that  so what would you suggest  ask mr molesley to join us  itd be kinder to alfred in the long run  kinder than asking more than he can give  how is that poor footman i thought carson would eat him alive  very glum to be honest he has been a clot  ill have to send the coat to london get it done quickly  this dinner has to be the grandest of the grand  what do you hope to show her why downton matters  why it mustnt fall apart  hasnt cora had her share of levinson gold  whats left is headed for your uncle  hes as rich as croesus as it is  so you mean to fleece her since you could get us out of this hole  i wont take any criticism thank you  will she do it granny will make her or die in the attempt  now stop talking and kiss me before i get cross  you heard him youll know at once  i wish you could get those maids under control  theyve broken one of the serving dishes this time  were short of a footman a kitchen maid and one house maid at least  thats if annas to be a proper ladys maid what lady mary wants  naturally she likes things done properly  we cant do things properly until his lordship allows us the staff  or until you and the blessed lady mary  come down from that cloud and join the human race  i can only suppose you are overtired good night  you see she good night mr carson  we will discuss the dinner in the morning  hm  and no mrs patmore you may not tell him  oh have you finished with mr matthew  i have hes in the dining room you wont need  to attend to him again mr molesley is coming up from the village  has mr matthew complained its not your fault  weve hurried you along too fast you mustnt feel badly  this is thomass doing but dont you fret  ill make him sorry  im on your side  im glad somebody is  no mary shes a married woman now so she can have breakfast in bed  hm im sorry about your tails  carsons sending them up on the london train this morning  theyll have to put a new panel in  we thought wed get molesley to come and look after you  he knows your ways im perfectly happy  i think it best if he comes i must talk to you about the staff we need  not now carson send for molesley if mrs crawley has no objection  edith  oh papa how could you  crawley do you know what that was  im afraid i probably do  im sorry but enough of my fathers money  has already been poured into downton  why should harold lose half his inheritance for our folly  so its all papas fault it isnt my mothers or brothers  i dont see why they should pay for it well still ask  what are you so afraid of if we sell we move to a smaller house  and a more modest estate we dont have to go down the mine  you dont understand mary a lot of people live in smaller houses  than they used to which shows youre american and im english  i shall be countess of grantham one day and the countess of grantham  lives at downton abbey  what job might you be suited to  were not here to give you food we want you to find your place in life  do you want to speak to me  yes mrs crawley i do  have you come for our help youre very welcome if you have  wait a minute i know you  you were the maid who brought your child  into the dining room at downton sorry this has been a mistake  i thought i was ready to ask you but im not im not ready  ask me what  im sorry to keep you waiting ladies  its not quite as simple  oh my god mrs patmore will you please leave the hysteria to me  im afraid the test was inconclusive  i had hoped the fluid from the cyst would be clear but theres blood  not enough to confirm the presence  of cancer but too much to exclude it  so what happens now  i send it away for analysis and this stage will take some time  how much time anything up to two months  oh my  until then try to take it more easy  sit down and put your feet up if you can  chanced be a fine thing  would you like me to say something to lady grantham  no thank you doctor ill speak to her myself if i need to  thank you  my darling girl whats this  i think you know since you asked sir anthony to write  edith you understand i only want whats best for you  and youre the judge of that in this  sybil marries a chauffeur and you welcome him here  but when i love a gentleman you cast him out she has a point  strallan is certainly a gentleman besides which he has a house  he has money a title everything that you care about  you make me sound very shallow arent you  when you make me give him up because he has a bad arm  hes quarter of a century too old  did she tell you that your daughter is sad and lonely  now i dont mean to interfere dont you  if you ban him from downton ill only go to his house  i dont believe hed see you ill wait outside until he does  how can you not like him because of his age  when almost every man we grew up with is dead  do you want me to spend my life alone i do like him very much  so do i papa so do i  please ask him back  he writes hes not coming to mamas dinner please make him  please please please  oh all right then  i found mrs bartlett  i wrote back to the tenant of the house explaining  and they sent me a forwarding address  i dont know why they didnt before  but it doesnt mean shell talk to you why not  audrey bartlett was the nearest thing vera had to a friend  thats why i want to meet her she wont see the real anna bates  shes doesnt have to like me i need her to be honest  im going to write and ask for a meeting  i can get to london and back in a day  she wont agree  ive the rent from the house i can make it worth her while  why do you think vera  didnt go and see her instead of sending that letter eh  when vera was frightened about your visit  she wrote that letter saying how scared she was instead of seeing her  maybe she did both  so  whats the news at home  i shouldnt tell you really  i havent told any of the others  its breaking the code of a ladys maid  his lordships in trouble  it seems he may have to sell  what sell downton  that makes me sad  i wouldnt have thought much could touch me in here but that does  it hasnt come they promised and promised and i thought  it was sure to be on the 7 oclock but its not  ill just have to wear a black tie  but lady mary surely  these things dont matter as much as they did lady mary knows that  thank you i know im early  granny come and see what weve done oh  what do you think  nothing succeeds like excess  when shall we tackle her after dinner  well get her on her own she wouldnt want to see all this go  now its for her granddaughter  never mistake a wish for a certainty lets hope she wont  mrs patmore what is it now its smoking the range  the winds in the wrong direction rake it through  wheres alfred in the servants hall  where are they his what his bloody evening shirts  where have you put them i havent touched them why would i  have you done this why would i know anything about his shirts  when i find out keep your histrionics to yourself hurry up  her ladyships in the drawing room his lordships not even dressed  you cant have lost them all i havent lost any of them  theyve been taken by someone stolen  why would they do that to get at me  are you not popular downstairs  i wouldnt say that my lord  but you know how people can be  they like a little joke this is quite unacceptable  if you uncover the culprit refer them to me  but for now what are we going to do  good evening sir john  it cant be going out there must be a block in the flue  the dinners not cooked we havent put in the souffles  therell be no souffles tonight what on earth is going on  weve 20 lords and ladies in the drawing room  waiting for dinner and weve got no dinner to give them oh my god  why are you not in white tie  im afraid they never sent my tails back  you are not in white tie either what have you come as  im sorry thomas has lost my dress shirts why is he still here  i thought you gave him his marching orders i had  my dear motherinlaw intervened ive a good mind to tell her  no she must have it all her own way tonight  you two are dressed for a barbecue i feel like a chicago bootlegger  that sounds almost as peculiar as you look  come quickly what is it the ovens broken down  it cant have what does that mean  it means we have no food oh  funny clothes and no food should be quite an evening  thank you mother  nothings cooked and nothings going to be cooked  but surely shall we tell them to go home  no theyve come for a party well give them a party  clear the table go down to the larders  bring up bread fruit cheese chicken ham  were going to have an indoor picnic  theyre going to eat whatever they want wherever they want  are you quite sure madam its not how we do it  how you used to do it it might be fun i agree  well all pull together and itll be great fun yes  i know what we need does anyone play the piano  this is so not what we wanted it to be  if its the end of your undignified campaign i wont be sorry  we cant just give up certainly not  do you think i might have a drink  oh im so sorry i thought you were a waiter  slice that finely fetch some parsley cut the dry bits off  can i lend a hand i dont mind helping  i think its good to do other things sometimes i know you do  theres not much left of this cut it in squares put it with ham  youre very smart in your valets outfit  alfred check the meat larder  bring anything back you think a human being could swallow  chop chop mrs hughes we can rest later but not yet mr carson  mr carsons right theres not a minute to lose  psst  do you want to know a secret the shirts thomas thinks he stole  i saw who took them and i know where they are  who did take them never mind that  but i followed ill show you if you want  why are you being so nice to me  because i like you and you can say it just like that  im an american alfred and this is 1920  time to live a little  i thought you was trying to find something about for mrs levinson  find out what when she reads them like the palm of her hand  she wont help you know help with what  never mind just kiss me again  now all of you find whatever it is that you want to eat  and take it wherever you want to sit  anywhere anywhere  if you have ever wanted to explore downton this is your chance  im sorry if its all a bit casual its exciting  i feel like the bright young people they write about  thank you lady mellendorf cheer up she wont be here forever  how much damage will be done before she goes  let me call you sweetheart  im in love with you  let me hear you whisper  that you love me too  keep the lovelight glowing  in your eyes so true  let me call you sweetheart  im in love  with  you   is there anything for our supper  ive taken a veal and egg pie  oh i wish youd let me talk to mr carson  i dont want to be a sick woman in his eyes for the next two months  or a dying one in the months to come after that  shh i know itll be all right  no you dont  but i appreciate the sentiment  are you sure you wont wake up in ten years  and wonder why youre tied to this crippled codger  only if you keep talking like that  do you know how much you mean to me  you have given me back my life  thats more like it  you wont wait to give you the chance to change your mind  dont worry i can get it organised in a month  shall we tell them tonight  no no ill come back in the morning  can i ask you something why do you like that american girl  steady who says i do dont you  i suppose i do and it doesnt matter that shes fast  or that you wont see her again after shes gone home  she made me feel good about myself for the first time here alfred  hurry up i need you to take around the claret  wont they spill it on the floor  if you ask me we are staring into the chaos of gomorrah  but we have to give them more wine and you are going to help  whats that i have to take it upstairs for his lordship  well be quick about it  ill help you any way i can thank heavens  it seems our family owes downtons survival  to the levinsons not once but twice  no im so sorry but youve misunderstood me  i cannot rescue downton its a shame if it has to go  but i cant but why not  because your grandpa tied the money down  he felt the crawley family had quite enough  but you said youd help us  i can entertain all of you in newport and in new york  and i can add to coras dress allowance but thats all  my income is generous but i cannot touch the capital  besides mary the world has changed  these houses were built for another age  are you sure you want to continue with the bother of it all  quite sure if i knew i was going to lose it id look on the sunny side  both of our husbands tied the money up tight before they were taken  lord grantham wasnt taken  he died  i suppose its scraps for the servants tonight  mrs patmores kept something by  who put them back  what the shirts who put them back  theyre back you mean you overlooked them in the first place  dont tell me what i mean  im warning you you sound like tom mix in a wildwest picture show  stop warning me and go lay out his lordships pyjamas  what are you laughing at those missing shirts went for a walk  and now theyve come home really have they  you didnt see nothing i agree  cos if you did ill cut ya  oh  dont ever threaten me  i forgot i was sharing a cell with a murderer  dont forget it again  this evening has made me homesick for america  its time to go  i dont suppose you want some whisky to take to bed  oh but id love one no water  thank you  im sorry i cant help you keep downton robert  thats what mary wanted  ah  i thought there was something  you know the way to deal with the world today  is not to ignore it if you do youll just get hurt  sometimes i feel like a creature in the wilds  whose natural habitat is gradually being destroyed  some animals adapt to new surroundings  it seems a better choice than extinction  i dont think it is a choice  i think its whats in you  lets hope that whats in you will carry you through these times  to a safer shore  is everything all right  certainly  was there something you wanted  the kitchen managed well tonight in difficult circumstances  his lordship sent his thanks  was the evening a success  the odd thing is i think it was  for me everyone sprawled on the floor  eating like beaters at a break in the shooting isnt a party  its a works outing  wheres the style mrs hughes wheres the show  perhaps people are tired of style and show  well in my opinion to misquote dr johnson  if youre tired of style you are tired of life  hm good night mr carson  youd say if anything was wrong wouldnt you  i know ive been a bit crabby but i am on your side  thank you for that  youve just missed an admirer mr carson says you did well tonight  oh did you tell him  no  what is there to tell  one day i will die  and so will he and you  and every one of us under this roof  you must put these things in proportion mrs patmore  and i think i can do that now  something happening in this house is about me  strallan is the traditional choice  edith is beginning her life as an old mans drudge  this is the moment you receive a huge fortune to save downton  and you give it away i hope you can understand im trying  downton place where am i to go we still own the village  i could open a shop fashionably late is one thing  so it is cancer dont say anything  shed hate to think the doctor told you
