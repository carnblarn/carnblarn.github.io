                thats the last of the equipment gone  the maids have put the drawing room back to normal  im walking down to the village i want to have a word with travis  richard will be here any moment  thats why im telling you give him my excuses ill see him at dinner  is there any news on the bates situation  not that im aware of  so you still want to keep him on  cora batess wife has committed suicide its very sad of course  but not when i last looked a reason to sack him  theyve taken the rest of the beds  so thats the finish of it not quite we still have matthew  and i wanted to ask you isnt it time he went home  i see you want to throw him out  robert i want him to learn to be as independent as he can  and i want mary to get on with her life whats wrong with that  is there something youre not telling me what do you mean  about mary and matthew some element you havent told me  of course not youre being silly  if thinking that trying to protect mary with a  ring of steel is silly then yes i am very silly  you shouldnt be doing that  let us hope the end of the war brings the return of the footman mr crawley  do you think they will return i certainly hope so  im sure sir richard can buy you a dozen when you get to haxby  let me no mlord i can manage  the handle broke  arent we feeding you theyre from my mothers apple store  she always loads me up  hows your boy doing freddie  yes freddie hes doing very well  i wrote to the headmaster of ripon grammar i said to look out for him  that thats so kind mlord  i hope it works i dont see why it should but you never know  i suppose you miss your husband very much  of course  but i have freddie  and when you think of what some families have gone through i know  almost 30 dead on this estate alone  and the elcots down at longway lost three out of four sons  mrs carters only boy was killed a month before the end of the war  poor william  and then theres matthew  do you ever wonder what it was all for  id better go in mlord  the train was late  welcome to the new world  when a war is over the first emotion is relief  the second disappointment  how sad  but how true  come in and have some tea  will you miss the extra staff mrs patmore  not really when push comes to shove id rather do it myself  though god knows what im to feed them on  theres nothing out there to be had well  the lord tempers the wind to the shorn lamb  what about you thomas how much longer will you stay  well now the last of the invalids have gone i suppose im finished  ill report to major clarkson but he wont be taking anyone on  i suppose the hospital will revert to the way it was before the war  where will you go whats it to you  where will you go ill tell you where im going  into business its all set up  do you mean black market business  dont look so surprised  ive found a dealer and as soon as i make  the payment ill have the supplies  where will you keep them ive got a shed in the village  and ill get a banger to deliver the stuff  ill be well fixed as soon as word gets out you heard her  there are shortages all around  isnt it dangerous i dont think so  i dont think the police are bothered about rationing now the wars over  it wont last forever but by the time its done  i should have enough to go into business properly  so thats your future settled as a plutocrat  in the meantime have you found somewhere to live  not yet but theres no hurry  im sure they wont object if i stop here for a week or two  i shouldnt bet on it  i nearly put out the new dinner jacket mlord  but then mr carson said the dowager was dining here quite right  mustnt frighten the horses  by the way her ladyship was asking if there was any more news about mrs bates  i dont think so mlord  theyd like to know why she did it but i dont suppose we ever shall  youd think shed leave a note  perhaps it was a spur of the moment decision it cant have been  wouldnt she have to get hold of the stuff  please forgive me i was thinking aloud well drop the subject  anna  it is anna isnt it yes sir  i want to ask a favour of you of me sir richard  you ive been waiting for you  i wonder if you could step into my room for a moment  you attend lady mary and her sisters dont you  in addition to your other duties  i do sir yes  you must be kept very busy i hope its worth your while  because i would be very willing to increase your stipend  if this is about coming with lady mary when you marry  its very good of you sir but you see  my fiance mr bates works here and i dont think i  no its not that although its a pity  lady marys very fond of you  thats kind  you see im anxious to make lady mary happy  of course you are sir and to that end i feel i need to know  a great deal more about her than i do  our customs are so strange in this country  a couple is hardly allowed a moment alone  together before they walk down the aisle  im not sure i understand sir  id like to know more about her interests  where she goes whom she sees what she says to them  excuse me sir do you mean you want me to give you  a report of lady marys actions  it will be extra work but im happy to pay  im sure  but im afraid i wouldnt have the time thank you sir  its your choice of course  id be grateful if you didnt mention this to lady mary  i wouldnt want her to think i was checking up on her  i nearly came down in a dinner jacket tonight  really well why not a dressing gown  or better still pyjamas  thats why i didnt  i like the new fashions shorter skirts looser cuts  the old clothes were all very well if one spent the day  on a chaise longue but if one wants to get anything done  the new clothes are much better  ill stick to the chaise longue  granny you dont want things to go back to the way they were surely  of course i do and as quickly as possible  what about you papa  before the war i believed my life had value  i suppose i should like to feel that again  have you seen the boys haircuts the women are wearing in paris  i hope you wont try that  i might  im not sure how feminine it is  im not sure how feminine i am very im glad to say  carson i keep forgetting to tell mrs hughes  weve had a letter from major bryants mother  she and her husband are in yorkshire on friday  and she wants to pay us a visit why  the last time they saw him alive it was here i can understand  will they be staying my lady no but well give them luncheon  that way they can talk about the major with all of us who knew him  that lets me out thank heaven  you look very fine  everything i own is from my season before the war  im trying to wear them out  where have you been all day nowhere ive just been busy  i envy you  i feel so flat after the rush and bustle of the last two years  they were sighing for the old days at dinner  but all i could think about was how much  more i want from life now than i did then  does this mean that youve made up your mind at last  no not quite but almost  what do you mean how did she say it  mr and mrs bryant are coming for luncheon on friday  how are things over at haxby pretty good  building materials are in short supply  but sir richard knows how to get around that  i bet he does  well you should see some of the gadgets in the kitchens  and the bathrooms  oh goodness me  theyre like something out of a film with theda bara  im surprised you know who theda bara is  i get about mrs hughes i get about  but will you be happy there thats what i want to be sure of  if youre asking whether ill regret leaving downton  i will regret it every minute of every day  i thought i would die here  and haunt it ever after  well then  you see i think i can help her  in those early years when its important to get it right  and if i can help her then i must  i wish i could understand  to me lady mary is an uppity minx  whos the author of her own misfortunes  you didnt know her when she was a child mrs hughes  she was a guinea a minute then  i remember once she came in here  she cant have been more than four or five years old  she said mr carson ive decided to run away  and i wonder if i might take some of the silver to sell  well  i said that could be awkward for his lordship  suppose i give you sixpence to spend in the village instead  very well  says she but you must be sure to charge me interest  and did you  she gave me a kiss in full payment  then she had the better bargain  i wouldnt say that  there you are mrs hughes they said you were in here  might i have a word of course shall we go to my room  theres no reason mr carson shouldnt hear it  in fact i think he probably should  you see ive had a request from sir richard that you ought to know about  youve done this before  bates can i ask you something  if i started to feel a tingling in my legs  what do you think that might mean  have you told dr clarkson  yes he says its an illusion  memory of a tingling or something  but i mean i do know my back is broken  i understand that i wont recover but  i do keep feeling it or i think i do  i should wait and see  if something is changing it will make itself known  now will that be all yes thank you  bates  please dont tell anyone  i couldnt bear it if miss swire or mother or  or anyone started to hope  i wont say a thing  good night sir  morning  morning  i dont know why im doing this i must be out of my mind  because you know its my last chance thats true they wont be back  not after this trip so what should i do  come to the house but stay outside in the game larder  ill leave some food there and a blanket  and then ill try and find a moment alone with mrs bryant  and tell her about little charlie  and then if she asks  only if she asks mind you  ill bring her out to see the child what about him  if either of them are in the least interested itll be the mother  and do you think shell help me she might  suppose she wont see him  then youre no worse off than you are already  look i shouldnt be doing it so if youre not keen  then for heavens sake lets forget all about it no  ill be there i promise  doesnt it feel odd to have the rooms back  and only us to sit in them  i suppose well get used to it i dont want to get used to it  what do you mean  i know what it is to work now  to have a full day to be tired in a good way  i dont want to start dress fittings or paying calls  or standing behind the guns but how does one escape all that  i think ive found a way to escape nothing too drastic i hope  it is drastic theres no going back once ive done it  but thats what i want no going back  i dont want to go back either  then dont  youre far nicer than you were before the war you know  where did you get it all i told you this bloke from leeds  where did he get it  somes army surplus somes from america  and ireland everywhere  hes got contacts all over thats what im paying him for  how much have you paid him a lot  but im not worried ive taken nothing perishable  this lot will last for months  ill be sold out long before any of its gone off  starting with mrs patmore  but carson if youre abandoning me  i think i deserve to know the reason why  i do not believe that sir richard and i would work well together  but there must be more to it than that  you knew what sir richard was like  we were to educate him together you and i wasnt that the plan  sir richard offered anna a sum of money  to report your activities to him  whom you saw what you said  he wanted her to spy on me naturally he used a different word  naturally  and she refused  she refused and she reported the offer to mrs hughes and me  well i wish shed come to me first  so you mean youd be uncomfortable  working for a spymaster  how disappointing of you  and i always thought you were fond of me  there you are  what about a quick walk before dinner we ought to change first  will that be all my lady yes carson thank you  i think that will be all  carson has decided not to come with us to haxby  im sorry is there anything i can say to change your mind  im afraid not sir  what a shame  not really butlers will be two a penny  now theyre all back from the war  i gather carson was looking for me  shall i go and find him mlord  its all right tell him ill be in the dressing room  has he done the red wine yet its over here mlord  im pleased its a new one on me  i had some at a dinner in london and ordered it  carson thought we might try it tonight  well id better go up  you made me sad yesterday wondering what the war was for  dont listen to me  im a foolish man whos lost his way  and dont quite know how to find it again  im terribly sorry  please try to forgive me  i do forgive you  mr carson  his lordship said you were looking for him  and  and well i was to say that youd find him in the dressing room  whats the matter with you nothing  i wrestled with it mlord i dont mind admitting  and i wanted to be there to help lady mary and  and protect her from sir richard  well i wouldnt quite have put it like that but yes i suppose  only only you felt you couldnt work for a man  who would offer a bribe that is correct mlord  are you quite sure you wont regret it  i know how fond you are of lady mary  but i couldnt work for a man that i dont respect  and i certainly couldnt have left downton for him  i shall take that as a compliment for myself and for my house  i still dont see why you didnt tell me first  im sorry mlady but i didnt want to add to your troubles  well you have done whether you wanted to or not  nobodys down yet they wont be long  look theyve cleared the tea but forgotten to take that tray  ring the bell ill do it theyll be busy getting dinner ready  its too heavy for you no its not look out  heavens that was a near thing  my god  mary girls  cora come at once robert wait  everyone come at once what is it whats happened  come and see this  is it true is it true what lavinia says  i dont believe it its so wonderful  it is but dont tire yourself out  sit down now and well send for dr clarkson  shes right edith go with branson  get clarkson but fetch mama and cousin isobel as well  i dont care what theyre doing tell them to come now  my dear chap  i cannot begin to tell you what this means to me  its pretty good news for me too  there is only one possible explanation  it starts with my own mistake  every indication told me that the spine was transected  which would have been incurable  but when sir john coates came to see matthew he agreed with you  well he didnt not entirely  he thought that it could conceivably be a case of spinal shock  that is um intense bruising  which was sufficiently severe to impede the leg mechanism  but which would heal  why didnt you tell us  because i didnt agree with him  and i didnt want to raise captain crawleys hopes to no purpose  i understand and i dont blame you  you must take it slowly rome wasnt built in a day i know  and im afraid you will carry a bruise on your spine for the rest of your life  but i will have a life yes  i think we can say that you will have a  normal life and it wont be long in coming  my darling boy  my darling boy  excuse me mlord but mrs hughes is  wondering what she should do about dinner  youll all stay for dinner wont you  im afraid im not dressed never mind that who cares about that  what about you mama certainly  all this unbridled joy has given me quite an appetite  there you are i wondered what had happened to you  its wonderful news isnt it wonderful are you busy  im just going up to help in the dining room why itll keep  no tell me ive got time  its just something his lordship said recently i cant get out of my mind  how vera must have bought the poison and taken it home with her  yes i suppose she must  and its a terrible thing to think of  but she didnt i did  what months ago before i left  vera said we needed rat poison and i bought it  it was arsenic ive been thinking thats what she must have taken  have you told the police no tell them  if you dont and they find out itll look bad  but wouldnt i be asking for trouble you are if you stay silent  anna were starting sorry mr carson  tell me how are things progressing at haxby  quite well ive put in a condition  so the builders are fined for every day they go over  does that make for a happy atmosphere i want it done  they can be happy in their own time  why the rush  i like everything i own to be finished and ready to sell  youre not thinking of selling haxby surely  depends well have to see if it suits us to be so close to downton  i i want to tell you all something  as you know during this well i think i can say horrible time  lavinia has proved to be the most marvellous person  hear hear indeed  i never thought we would marry for all sorts of reasons  but she wouldnt accept that and so now i am very pleased to say  that shes been proved right  lavinia and i will get married my dear fellow  isnt it wonderful as soon as im well enough to walk down the aisle  dr clarkson can help us with when not long now  and she feels we ought to marry here at downton  to bury forever the memories of what i hope has been  the darkest period of my life   of course  are you sure  i know it should be at my home in london  but weve been through so much here  wed be delighted bravo excellent news  mary isnt that excellent news  just excellent  youre very late wont they worry  theyre all so excited they wont care where i am  im pleased i like mr matthew  he announced at dinner that he wants to get married at downton  somehow it made me feel more than ever  that the war is really over and its time to move forward  do you mean youve made your decision  yes  my answer is that im ready to travel  and youre my ticket  to get away from this house away from this life  me  no uncle tom cobley  im sorry  but ive waited so long for those words  i cant believe im hearing them  you wont mind burning your bridges mind  fetch me the matches  yes you can kiss me but that is all until everything is settled  for now god knows its enough that i can kiss you  what a day i cant stop smiling  no but another time please ask me before you agree to host a wedding  what im fond of matthew of course  but you do realise this means marys marriage will be delayed  i cant help that mary is our first priority robert  and just because matthews been lame  matthews been lame  can you hear the words coming out of your mouth  can you hear how stupid and selfish they are  because i can  dont bother me with it now  ive enough on trying to make a luncheon that looks worth eating  but thats what im saying everythings in short supply now  short supply no supply more like  talk about making a silk purse out of a sows ear  i wish we had a sows ear itd be better than this brisket  thats just it thomas has come by some groceries and such  and hes prepared to let them go for the right price  hes prepared to let them go is he  and how did he come by them thats what id like to know  well theyre not stolen in case youre worried  im not worried youre the one who should be worried  tell you what im making a wedding cake now for mr crawley  ill finish it early and feed it with brandy  so if i give you a list of ingredients can you get them  i can and then well see  now will you leave me and let me get on with this travesty  why are you here  mr bryant mrs bryant welcome  were so pleased to be here  this is so kind of you lady grantham  it is but we ought to make it clear we cant stay long  i wasnt sure we had time to come at all  luncheon is quite ready  we must eat and run im afraid we have to be at maryport by six  were all so terribly sorry about the reason youre here  if we could see charless room shall i take mrs bryant up  no ill do it well all do it  my cousin mrs crawley who looked after major bryant  and my daughters who nursed him will join us how thoughtful  but we cant be long ive told our chauffeur to stay in the car  will i take him something to eat leave him be hes quite happy  please come and see where major bryant lived while he was with us  im afraid its not going to work why  theyre in the dining room and getting  straight into the car when theyve finished  i tried to speak to her on my own but there was never the right moment  your grandaddy is a bit of a bully  but i must see them ive come all this way  of course its a disappointment  you said yourself there wouldnt be another chance we cant know that  maybe you should write to them after all  youve nothing to lose no they have to see him they must see charlie  well maybe they will sometime in the future  i hope so  youd better go now  this wedding cake can i make it  you wouldnt know how to start  but you can tell me  and if i make it early then you can make another if its no good  if i say yes will you do as youre told  daisy theres a wretched chauffeur at the front  whos not allowed to get out of the car  so can you make him a sandwich and take him up a bottle of pop  weve some ham and my god  who was that wasnt that ethel  did you see what she was carrying no  then just lets leave it at that  im afraid downton will be a place of pilgrimage for a while  were glad to be if we can help to bring some peace of mind  theres no point in wallowing in it what good does it do  leave me alone ethel  i tried to stop her what on earth  ethel i know what this is  mrs hughes i dont think its quite the right  im stopping  until ive had my say  this is charlie your grandson  hes almost a year old  what proof have you  what i say what proof have you  if my son was the father of this boy where is your proof  have you any letters any signed statement  why would there be letters we were in the same house  i think shes telling the truth im not interested in think  i want proof that my son acknowledged paternity of this boy  if what you say is true then he would have known  of the boys existence for months before he  before he was killed  yes he knew  so what did he do about it  nothing  he did nothing thank you  thats the proof i was looking for  if charles was the father he would never  have shirked his responsibilities never  well he did i wont listen to any more slander  now will you please go and take that boy with you whoever he is  you are upsetting mrs bryant i would like  i say you are upsetting mrs bryant  lord grantham are you going to stand by while this woman holds us to ransom  this isnt doing much good ethel youd better come with me  come on  she thinks were a soft touch  they hear of a dead officer with money behind them  and suddenly theres a baby on every corner  but if shes telling the truth  if charles had fathered that boy he would have told us  now id say shes done her homework and discovered he was an only child  she thinks wed be ripe for the plucking  you knew her was she one of the nurses when he was here  she was a housemaid  were you aware no  noone told me major bryant was your only son  thats right just charles  matthew is my only son and he nearly died  i think i know what youre going through he seems such a nice  i think thats cast rather a shadow over the proceedings  so i dont see any point in prolonging it  daphne come on were leaving  hes afraid of his own grief thats why he behaves as he does  hes terrified of his own grief  if thats what hes like i dont want his help i dont want it  i doubt youll have the option youre a dark horse  how did you keep it a secret all this time  maybe when hes thought about it hell feel differently you never know  anna will you kindly go upstairs and help in the dining room  ethel please take the child and leave  how did you get here i caught the bus and walked up from the village  then can you reverse the process as quickly as possible  shes very badly shaken mr carson shes lost everything  are you all right for the fare yes thank you  hes their only grandchild there can never be another  even if ethel is telling the truth i believe she is  even so theres no legal reality to it  the child is her bastard and has no claim on them  steady on sir the ladies have had enough shocks for one day  i just dont see the point in pretending something can be done when it cant  what about you mother cant one of your refugee charities help  shes not a refugee and we have more claims on our funding than we can meet  the truth is ethels made her choice and now shes stuck with it  that seems a little hard does it  arent all of us stuck with the choices we make  candied peel well well i never thought youd find that  i hope youre pleased mrs patmore  course she is arent you theres stuff  here we havent seen since before the war  i cant wait to get started  i wont ask where you got it from because i dont want to know  i keep saying theres nothing wrong so what id like to know is  when will he get paid when im satisfied  and when will that be oh mighty one  when daisys baked the cake and im pleased with it  he understands  he knows this is just the sprat to catch the mackerel  i really ought to walk to the library  no need to rush it sir youre getting better every day  cousin matthew may i come in please  no no no no stay where you are thank you  no doubt you will regard this as rather unorthodox  my pushing into a mans bedroom uninvited  well erm its just i dont want us to be disturbed  im sure you know how pleased i am that you will recover after all  thank you  just as i am delighted that you can once more look forward to a  to a happy married life  im very lucky  now this may come as a surprise  but i feel i must say it all the same please do  mary is still in love with you what  i was watching her the other night when you spoke of your wedding  she looked like juliet on awakening in the tomb  mary and i have always had  of course i suspected long ago  that the flame hadnt quite gone out  but then there was no chance of your recovery  and it seemed best to let her try for happiness where she could  i quite agree and sir richard is  no now lets not muddy the pool by discussing sir richard  the point is you loved her once  are you sure you cant love her again  cousin violet  please dont think i mind your speaking to me in this way  i quite admire it but consider this  lavinia came back against my orders determined  to look after me for the rest of my life  which meant that she would wash me and feed me and  do things that only the most dedicated nurse would undertake  and all with no hope of children or any improvement  yes its all very admirable and i give her full credit  and giving her that credit do you think it would be right for me  to throw her over because i can walk  to dismiss her because i no longer have need of her services  spoken like a man of honour  and we will not fall out over this  but you dont agree  i would just say one thing  marriage is a long business  theres no getting out of it for our kind of people  now you may live 40 50 years with one of these two women  just make sure you have selected the right one  will it be april or may  i should steer clear of may marry in may rue the day  i think its april matthew should be walking normally by them  spring weddings are the prettiest of all  all this talk of weddings is making me impatient  i dont think we can go into competition with matthew and lavinia do you  after then in the summer lets settle it before i return to london  you must be looking forward to travelling again  i know i am  very well the end of july  then we can be out of england for august  you dont sound very excited  to quote you thats not who we are  theres something ive been meaning to ask you heres the hero  here we are  why did you try to bribe anna  she told you did she she didnt not me  but why did you do it  next time if you want to know anything just ask me  well done very well done  all right then i will once and for all are  you still in love with matthew crawley  of course not  would i ever admit to loving a man who preferred someone else over me  wheres sybil shes not feeling well  she told anna she wouldnt be down for dinner  what is it i heard from my lawyer today  apparently vera wrote to a friend just before my last visit  why are they telling you now it was only delivered a few days ago  and do you know what the letter says they sent me a copy  john has written and hes coming here tonight  his words sound as angry as ive ever heard him  and you know how angry that is  i never thought id say this but im afraid for my life  what did you write to her  i said i was coming that evening and i meant to have it out with her  i may have said she was being unreasonable but so she was  will it change anything think about it  before veras death she had taken all my money  and she had wrecked the divorce now as her widower  i inherit everything and we can marry whenever we like  anna theyre going in  you look as if youve got the cares of the world on your shoulders  not the whole world mrs hughes but quite enough of it  sybil  sybil i just want to say goodnight  mrs hughes can i borrow the duplicate keys for upstairs  why lady mary says one of the bathroom keys isnt working  she thinks it must have got swapped  ill come  no no theres no need ill bring them back in a jiffy  youve done enough for one day  my god shes eloped  shes on her way to gretna green  they must stop at some point it wont be open before morning  they wont expect us to follow until tomorrow  theyll stay somewhere on the road we hope  everyone keep an eye out for the motor  daisy what in gods name are you doing down here at this hour  i just wanted to check it were all right  that it hadnt you know caved in or anything caved in  its a cake not a souffle  i know but ive never made a wedding cake before  is that the one for tasting yes mrs patmore  well bring it out well give it a try  what in gods name do you call this  i dont know i did everything that you said i promise  but didnt you taste the mixture  well then im afraid its time to look at thomass ingredients  well its two thirds plaster dust wheres the peel  yuk this were old when adam were a boy  so thomas was happy to let it go was he  well it wont go anywhere near me in future  chuck the whole bally lot out and well have to think again  isnt that the car  how did you find us how did you know  never mind that at least nothings happened thank god  what do you mean nothings happened  ive decided to marry tom and your coming after me wont change that  this isnt the way shes right  of course mama and papa will hate it why should they  pipe down  sybil cant you let them get used to the idea  take your stand and refuse to budge but allow them time  that way you wont have to break up the family  they would never give permission you dont need permission youre 21  but you do need their forgiveness if youre not  to start your new life under a black shadow  dont listen shes pretending to be reasonable to get you home  even if i am even if i think this is mad  i know it will be better to do it in broad daylight  than to sneak off like a thief in the night  go back with them then  if you think they can make you happier than i will  am i so weak you believe i can be talked out  of giving my heart in five minutes flat  but marys right i dont like deceit and our parents dont deserve it  so ill go back with them  believe it or not i will stay true to you  ill return the car in the morning  youre confident you can bring her round arent you fairly  ill certainly try  do you want some money for the room  no thank you mlady i can pay my own way  where are the girls  i suppose sybils still ill and the others just havent appeared  i hope theyre not coming down with anything  the stories of this spanish flu are too awful  no its nothing of the sort why are you up so early  im meeting isobel she wants me to help with her refugees  i thought the whole point of mama arranging  that was to keep her out of your hair i know  but now the soldiers have gone i do have a lot  of time on my hands and maybe i can be useful  why is it different from before the war  i dont know exactly it just is  maybe the wars changed me  i guess its changed everybody  not me dont be too sure  if im not back before luncheon dont wait  ill take this down to keep it hot mlord  i wanted to catch you alone  yes you see i think you might be happier if i tended my resignation  what id hate you to be uncomfortable in your own house  i wont hear of it but i know  you will not be deprived of your livelihood  because i behaved in an ungentlemanly manner  the fault was entirely mine you will not pay the price  is this yours moseley found it in your dressing room  its not one of your old toys is it because i dont recognise it  no it was given to me as a charm i think to take to the front  well youre home and safe now  shall i put it in the barrel for the village children no  you never know it might be bad luck not to keep it  luncheon will be ready soon  its all rubbish its all bloody rubbish  cant you ask for your money back  yes of course i can ask and a fat lot of good thatll do  you must challenge him how  i only ever met him in a pub i wouldnt know where to find him  but surely  dont you understand woman  ive been tricked  ive been had  ive been taken for the fool that i am  how much did he get from you  every penny i had  and then
