                1 mary the men are arranging the concert now  and they are so anxious for us both to be in it  or therell be no girls at all please say you will  do i have to yes you do  keeping their spirits up is an important part of the cure and so very little to ask  whats going on the men are putting on a concert  can i help edith has it under control  i do if marys willing oh all right one song and thats your lot  what time is doctor clarksons round its already happened  without me why im not very late  we didnt see the need to wait mrs hughes i need to steal you for a minute  i have to check the linen books but i went over them last week  very good mlady ill get started surely i can  anna can you tell mrs patmore itll be easier for me to go through the menus this afternoon  of course your ladyship  cousin cora  please can it wait ive a mountain to get through  theres a parcel for you thank you  theres a little one for you  this one looks as if its been opened but it hasnt  ethel have you nothing to do  i was keeping her talking you mustnt blame her i dont  what a lovely day  are you quite sure about lavinia she wasnt sir richards mistress  she gave him the evidence to settle a debt of someone she loved  and this is your beau is it  a man who lends money then uses it to blackmail the recipient  he lives in a tough world and will you be joining him there  richard carlisle is powerful hes rich and getting richer  he wants to buy a proper house you know  with an estate  he says after the war the market will be flooded and we can take our pick oh  and you can dance on the grave of a fallen family  they will fall lots of them  some wont rise again but i dont intend to be among them  that leaves matthew thats done now granny finished  its time to move forward  what about sybil does she have anyone in her sights  not that i know of are you sure she has no chap in mind how odd  i had an endless series of crushes at her age i dont think so  not even some man she doesnt care to mention what do you mean  well war breaks down barriers  and when peacetime reerects them  its very easy to find oneself on the wrong side really granny  how can you say that im too worldly but sybils not worldly enough  you cannot be so contrary im a woman mary  i can be as contrary as i choose  but i dont understand the patients are always served their luncheon at 1230  well today theyll be served at one is this something i can help with  mrs patmore seems to be disobeying my instructions and i cant get to the reason why  if you mean the patients new lunchtime  her ladyship felt it made the staff luncheon unreasonably early  she moved it so they could eat at noon but that will interfere with the nurses shifts  oh no shes altered those too has she indeed  well well see about that  it was always a question of when  may i have a word can it wait no it cannot wait  ive just come from downstairs  where i learnt that my timetable has been wantonly disregarded  if you mean the new lunchtime  the wretched servants were having to eat at 11 and then starve until their tea at six so i  youve also torn up the nurses timetable i havent torn up anything  it would be foolish to accuse you of being unprofessional  as youve never had a profession in your life now just a minute  you may think you have the right to ordain the universe  but in this field  no not in this field  in this house yes i do have the right  given me by doctor clarkson and by the law of the land  this is my house and i am in charge right alongside you  if you would stop your bullying  thats enough i will not listen to this  if i am not appreciated here i will seek some other place where i will make a difference good  i mean it i cannot operate where i am not valued you must see that  certainly  i shall go i will  perhaps it would be best  i repeat  i mean it  im sure you do  and so do i  why did you promise carson not to stage any more protests  when you wouldnt promise me i had my reasons  but you wont be content to stay at downton forever will you  tinkering away at an engine instead of fighting for freedom  i thought youd join the rising in dublin last easter  i might have if it hadnt been put down in six short bloody weeks  but dont fret the real fight for ireland will come after the war and ill be ready for it  the truth is ill stay in downton until you want to run away with me  dont be ridiculous youre too scared to admit it  but youre in love with me  branson could you take me into ripon at three  im getting some things for mama is there anything you want  nothing you can find in ripon  well it is her house does that mean shes suddenly received a medical training  no  or are you like everyone else in thinking that because shes a countess  she has acquired universal knowledge by divine intervention  mrs crawley convalescent homes are not about medical training  they are far more to do with good food fresh air and clean sheets  very well ive had a letter from a cousin in paris  who is working for the wounded and missing enquiry department  theyve opened a branch in northern france under the aegis of the red cross  i shall offer them my services well thats thats very drastic  i have to go where i am useful  and that place im afraid is no longer downton abbey  youll be missed by you possibly  i hope so anyway  but not i think by lady grantham  if you were the only girl in the world  and i were the only boy   i wish we had a man  amen it would sound so much richer  but all the volunteers are spoken for  hows it going all right i suppose  if you dont mind singers who cant sing and actors who cant act  it helps to keep their spirits up so they say although i cant think why  i had a letter this morning from sir richard carlisle oh  he  he tells me he proposed when he was staying here  he apologises for not asking my permission but hes asking it now  have you decided is that why hes written  no but i have made the decision  which is i think i should take him  do you really my darling i wish i could believe in your motives  why what were your motives when you married mama  your mother has made me very happy  perhaps sir richard will make me very happy  what about matthew not you too poor matthew  what must he do to persuade you hes in love with lavinia  open his chest and carve her name on his heart  write to him tell him of your plans with carlisle you owe him that  i dont think i owe him anything  but ill write to him if you like  ill try to send you an address  but you can always get me through the red cross very good maam  ill try to contact captain crawley explain to him whats happened  if he does get leave hell probably come to me or stay in london  but if i miss him and he turns up here i know youll look after him  of course i will maam cook him what he likes  not whats good for him  you dont know when youll be back i dont think one knows anything in wartime  ill try to give you warning in the meantime look after yourselves  now i mustnt miss my train  so what now  ah anna said you were honouring us with your presence at dinner  its easier here than the hospital  i can always get changed back into my uniform if i need to  what were you talking to branson about when i came into the yard  nothing  then why were you there  why were you there because i was ordering the motor  that is why one talks to chauffeurs isnt it  to plan journeys by road  he is a person he can discuss other things  im sure he can  but not with you what do you want from me  am i to see if sir richard carlisle has a younger brother  one even richer than he is  darling whats the matter with you im on your side  then be on my side  so there we have it i look forward to introducing the two of you  just as soon as you are next at home  which naturally i trust will be very soon indeed  please be glad for me as i will always be for you  your affectionate cousin mary  we dont need anyone with us the sergeant knows what were doing but what are we patrolling for  youve been taking those logic pills again this is the army mason  were going on a patrol because were going on a patrol  has mary set a date yet for the wedding she doesnt say  i think shes hoping the war will be over soon and they can set a date then  she couldve waited and told you when she saw you she doesnt know im due back  did you warn daisy or will it be a surprise no ive told her were coming to downton first  then ill visit my dad and go back to see her for a day at the end  fresh yorkshire air followed by london and miss swire all right for some sir  youd never swap though would you no id never swap  bates in a pub i cant see that i think your pals mistaken  he met him here twice before the war listen  i said to him hello mr bates and he walked off and wouldnt serve me after  next thing you know well have anna running across the county and dragging him back by his stick  im surprised he isnt here of his own accord  with his lordship having no valet since the loony went  dont speak ill of mr lang youre a funny one  talk about sweet and sour  better get back  want a cup  not really  what were you doing oh let me see  ive tidied the study  twice  and ive rearranged the coats in the hall  i might check his clothes for moth what about you  weve cleaned everything three times over  and ive sent beth into the village for some eggs to pickle  though the mistress doesnt really like them  well she never eats properly anyway not on her own  a butler cant do much with supper on a tray  beg your pardon for troubling you only the door was open  but the front gate was not no  what do you want have you got any spare food  spare food whats that when its at home  hang on hang on wait  from around here not far  i used to work on the farms but er not any more  did you get that in the war dont pity me im one of the lucky ones  i might have something for you  come on  hello mr molesley they told me you were up here  i hope you dont mind my bothering you not a bit what can i do for you  well actually mr carson ive been thinking there might be something i can do for you hm  that brushing for instance  i dont like having nothing to do  what with captain crawley away at the war and his mother in france alongside him  and then his lordships without a valet and and your plate is piled so high  i am quite occupied its true  so i thought id look in and give you a hand  brushing mending cleaning shoes  whatevers needed  thats kind of you mr molesley  we shall have to watch ourselves or else his lordship will want to pinch you off captain crawley  but he said hed be here by now and hes not you mustnt worry about him daisy  im not worried like that exactly but this is william i think we should all be worried  anything might have happened maybe his leave was cancelled  at times like these people vanish and turn up again in the strangest places  like mr bates in that pub  working in a public house thats what he said i thought theyd have told you  it doesnt seem likely that a trained valet like mr bates  would be content to work in a public house  well thats what he said have you mentioned this to anna  i havent said anything to anyone i thought you all knew  perhaps you should ask thomas oh i will ask thomas dont you worry about that my girl  didnt it occur to you that we might be interested to hear it not particularly  as far as i knew mr bates had left your employment you didnt think to tell carson  i am not under mr carsons command now your lordship  shoo daisy go to bed before you strain your eyes  thank you daisy for telling mr carson all about my private letter  i didnt know it was a secret sorry if i was wrong  theres no if about it  why answer his lordship at all  what did you want me to do tell him to get knotted  he doesnt pay your wages i see  well i wont put you down for a career in diplomacy then  whats he after to get bates back  if mr bates wanted his job back hed have written for it himself  why would he want his job back hes like you he got away  hes not very like me thank you but youre both free  of all the bowing and scraping and yes mlord and no mlord  i envy him i envy you  cos im ready for a new adventure and i dont care who hears me  be careful what you wish for  the truth is ill stay in downton until you want to run away with me  ah good morning anna you sent for me mlord  i did come in  i have something to tell you but i hope im right  carson didnt want you to be troubled with it  is this about mr bates mlord yes it is  i have no wish to upset you but it seems he may be back in yorkshire working in a public house  we dont yet know where  the red lion in kirby moorside  oh  youve seen him then i have yes mlord  and hes well he is  hes not been back to downton for two reasons  hes hoping to settle certain matters first with mrs bates  and does he think he can he believes so mlord  very good  and what is his second reason for avoiding us  he says he parted with your lordship on bad terms  he felt it might be embarrassing yeah  it is for me to feel embarrassed  i had to get out of that kitchen if im not to be found dead under the table  its like cooking a banquet three times a day  it is a lot of extra work whatever they say  even with the helpers  dont think they lighten the load  mrs bird whats going on  i knew id be found out sooner or later at least its you  found out doing what what does it look like  i dont know what it looks like except some kind of soup kitchen  youd better come inside  one at a time  now take a piece of bread  right daisy stand there give them a bowl and a spoon  when did all this start  that fella turned up asking for food  then he came back next day with a friend and here we are  what does mrs crawley say she doesnt know yet  i suppose shell put a stop to it when she gets back from france i hope not  to be honest mrs patmore im not sure i can manage much longer  how often do you do it i planned to get it down to once a week  and give them only the cheapest cuts  but it is my money and i dont know how much  now hold it right there  if we cant feed a few soldiers in our own village  them that have taken a bullet or worse for king and country then i dont know what  sorry about this mlady only theres no footman to do it now  i dont mind but youd better run before mrs hughes sees you  mlady could i ask something  only william who was in service here  i know william  well hes missing  that is he was supposed to be back on leave but he never turned up  he wrote he was coming home for a few days with captain crawley  is william your beau i wont say that no mlady  were all very fond of william downstairs of course you are  well im sure its nothing but ill see what i can find out  thank you  how do you know they didnt change their plans well of course i dont  but the poor girl seemed quite certain  just when isobels away and none of us know where she is typical  i suppose matthew might have heard from cousin isobel and decided to meet up in france instead  but that wouldnt explain why william isnt here  ill do what i can  no dont stop stirring the bottom will burn  you can leave those to daisy  thats it daisy put them in the special storage area  what do you want can i borrow some baking soda  borrow why are you planning to give it back  i might go over to malton tomorrow agatha spenlow is madly promoting her charity fair  do you need the motor im afraid i do can you get pratt to take you in the other car  it doesnt matter i can go on monday but why  im told bates is working at a public house in kirby moorside  i want to investigate  i cant decide which part of that speech is the most extraordinary  why cant someone else go because i want to go myself  so sybil what are you up to dear  nothing much working i dont have time to get up to anything else  only mary and i were talking about you the other day  oh  yes you see sometimes in war  one can make friendships that arent quite appropriate  and it can be awkward you know later on  i mean weve all done it i just want you to be on your guard  appropriate for whom well dont jump down my throat dear  im only offering friendly advice why do you want to see bates  to give him his old job back not entirely  i mainly want to see him because we parted badly  telephone call for you mlord if you did im sure its his fault  no it was mine  oh really its like living in a secondrate hotel  where the guests keep arriving and noone seems to leave  i see  yes thank you for letting me know  are you all right papa  that was the war office  matthew and william went out on a patrol a few days ago and they havent been seen since  oh my god lets not fall to pieces quite yet  it happens all the time apparently  and the men turn up in one field hospital or another  but they are treating them as missing in action its too early for that  there could be lots of things to explain it  you mean they could have been taken prisoner its possible  dont say anything to mary or your mother  or anyone in fact  not yet i shouldnt really have told you  what about cousin isobel i dont know how to contact her  anyway shes in france she may hear before we do  im not accusing her of anything  but i did wonder if you were aware of this special storage area  i daresay mrs patmore has her own system like we all do  right well ill say good night good night  ah mr molesley youre very late  i was doing some invisible mending on one of his coats  i got a bit carried away but im im quite pleased with the way it turned out  i dont see why you cant dress him until theres a new valet  itd be a blessing to mr carson id be happy to if itd help  keep this up and we wont be able to do without you at all  theres no reason why you should  oh er i may be wrong  but i thought i saw one of the officers by the maids staircase just now  im sure theres a perfectly reasonable explanation  lets hope so  good night  what the bloody ethel  we were only i know precisely what you were doing major  i may not be a woman of the world but i dont live in a sack  now if you would kindly take your things and go downstairs  ethel you are dismissed without notice and without a character  you will please leave before breakfast i didnt think i was  no and thats the problem  you never do  and youre not nervous  well i gather his lordship knows his own mind  but ive no difficulty with that  youll enjoy working in a big household  better than staring at me night after night  what would you say if they ask you to stay  it would be a big step up for me theres no point in denying it  because i think they might  do you really mrs bird  there goes mr molesley valet to the earl of grantham  stop it  but why  what could you have possibly done thats so terrible  have i taken everything of mine from there  would you like me to speak to her because i can  no she wouldnt listen  shes not a bad person mrs hughes  i know she can be strict but shes not  she wouldnt listen  were closed  i know ethel could be difficult mrs hughes  but she was very sorry for her mistake whatever it was  im sure its cost her her job but surely it cant  never mind why shes gone shes gone  and theres an end to it  by the way i hear mr bates is back in the county  mr carson says you know all about it  i gather his lordship has gone to see him  i know he told me he was going  why in heavens name didnt you mention any of it to me  it wasnt my secret to tell  im glad to hear it but carson said your wife made all sorts of threats  she wont carry them out  not now  since i left downton ive discovered that she was untrue to me  i may have been as bad in my heart mlord but ive done nothing to be ashamed of  the point is i can divorce her now whether she likes it or not  but whats to stop her blurting out her stories to the press  if she agrees to keep silent i will give her whatever she wants  she cant hold me now so her choice is between poverty and plenty  and what was the tale she was going to tell carson never made it clear  some silly nonsense mlord i wouldnt waste your time with it  whats the news from downton  daisy youre not to worry about william  i spoke to his lordship earlier  he says youre not to be concerned until we know more but he is missing  i mean they dont know where he is or captain crawley do they  there could be a hundred explanations yes  and one of them is that theyre dead  dont mistake me i hope very much theyre not  but we ought to face the truth what may be the truth  and what very well may not  anna do you think that mr bates will come back  thats for him to say i hope he does  he always seems a romantic figure to me  does he how do you define romantic  its no good him thinking he can turn up here without a moments notice and be cock of the walk  why is that thomas because the place is already taken  i hate the word missing it seems to leave so little room for optimism  i tell myself its too early to despair  but to be honest bates i dont think i can bear it  losing patrick was bad enough but now the thought of matthew gone  and the future once again destroyed  more than all that i loved him like a son  no i love him lets stay in the present tense while we still can  so will you come back with me  and help me through the vale of shadow  its not what i expected mlord but i will if you want me to  i misjudged you bates and i abused you when we parted  i should have had more faith im sorry  god knows youve shown more faith in me than i had any right to  there we are get this basket off my arm it weighs a ton  sybil  i never said anything to granny honestly  then why did she start talking about inappropriate friendships out of nowhere  she thinks you must have a beau and if we dont know about him then you have to be keeping him secret  its just granny being granny dont make such a thing of it  i dont deserve to be told off  not by her or by you nothings happened  why what might have happened i mean it  we havent kissed or anything i dont think weve shaken hands  im not even sure if i like him like that he says i do but im still not sure  we are talking about branson yes  the chauffeur branson oh how disappointing of you  im just trying to get it straight you and the chauffeur  you know i dont care about all of that darling dont be such a baby  this isnt fairyland what did you think  youd marry the chauffeur and wed all come to tea dont be silly  i told you i dont even think i like him what has he said to you  that he loves me and wants me to run away with him good god in heaven  hes frightfully full of himself you dont say  but i havent encouraged him i havent said anything really  you havent given him away though will you  well i wont betray him on one condition  you must promise not to do anything stupid  you must promise now or ill tell papa tonight  i promise  mr bates youre a sight for sore eyes  welcome home thank you mrs hughes  i thought it was you hello  come away in and give some substance to the gossip of your return  youll find things a bit different from when you left mr bates  downton at war precisely  theres some extra help in the kitchen all very nice people  and the nurses of course but they live down at the hospital  except for lady sybil nurse crawley please  so weve both returned you and i a couple of bad pennies  i havent thomas means hes not here as a servant  he manages the house hes a sergeant now  i take orders from major clarkson  he runs this place on behalf of the army medical corps  yet another reason to pray for peace  i heard about william from his lordship and captain crawley  im sure theyre all right  sorry im late has the dressing gong rung yet  youre not late mr molesley but er  mr bates is back and you reminded me id better ring it now  are you staying for good id need a crystal ball to answer that but ill stay for now  have you been standing in for me i was going to starting tonight yeah  then youll be relieved to see me oh tremendously  whats that  its a new kind of shoehorn i bought it for his lordship  thats very kind of you mr molesley thank you  daisy fetch me some more tea thomas ive got dinner  hot this time and its sergeant barrow to you  watch yourself mr bates thomas is in charge now  it wont do to get on the wrong side of him is there a right side  i dont believe it why would she sell food to mrs bird  it makes no sense  well i cant confirm the details of the arrangement  maybe they both sell it and divide the proceeds  either way i felt you should know  have you said anything to mrs hughes or carson ive tried with her  but theres none so blind as them that will not see  im curious next time come and fetch me  so bates is back papa must be pleased  and mr carson wont be sorry  branson theres something you ought to know  ive told mary  i see  well thats me finished then  and without a reference  no shes not like that you dont know her  she wouldnt give us away but she wont encourage us  no  why are you smiling i thought youd be angry  because thats the first time youve ever spoken about us  if you didnt care you would have told them months ago  oh i see because i dont want you to lose your job  it must mean im madly in love with you well doesnt it  you say im a free spirit and i hope i am  but youre asking me to give up my whole world and everyone in it  and thats too high a price to pay it is a high price  i love my parents  you dont know them  and i love my sisters my friends  im not asking you to give them up for ever  when they come around i will welcome them with open arms  and what about your people would they accept me  and what about my work what work bringing hot drinks to a lot of randy officers  look  it comes down to whether or not you love me thats all  thats it the rest is detail  ive written to vera spelling out the case and how she cannot win it  then ive told her i will be generous if she will cooperate  are you ready to give her everything because i am  whatever it takes i want a clean break and not an open wound  if we can just be patient a little while longer  we shouldnt be outside its cold  ill be patient and bear anything  except for you to go away again no thats done  youre stuck with me now for good and proper  theres something you ought to know  papa said not to tell you but i dont think hes right go on  matthews missing  he was on patrol and hes just sort of vanished  papa hasnt told anyone not even mama  i only know because i was there when he found out  it didnt seem right to keep you in the dark  im not trying to upset you truly  for once in my life i believe you  theyve told you then do they all know downstairs  williams missing too i think everyone knows except her ladyship  i wish edith had left it till the morning  i could have faced it all with one more night of sleep  mind out this is hot daisy spoons  unless theyre to drink directly from the bowl  do you think theres enough you could feed about 50 i reckon  go for the vegetable one the vegetable  may we come in your ladyship what a surprise  obrien seemed to think that you and mrs bird were engaged in a commercial venture of some sort  so i came to see for myself we are not your ladyship  i agree thats not what it looks like  we feed these men once a week and im not ashamed of it  ill be back before luncheon at the big house im sure  but is it true they are fed from our kitchens  only the stuff the army gives they are soldiers  what did i tell you daisys right we only use the food the army pay for  and all the men have served their country  in future i would prefer it if you would use food paid for by the house  i dont want the army to accuse us of mismanagement  youre going to let them get away with it oh more than that  im going to help them  and so are you  molesley maam if you bring that table over i suggest we divide the food  then we can form two lines and it will go faster  obrien you can manage the bread  daisy of course mlady  mmm what is it beef stew mlady  stand in a line  sergeant one moment  i hear youre becoming mighty imperious in your manner with the staff here  er daisy in particular  just because youre a poacher turned gamekeeper theres no need for rudeness no sir  so mind what i say  carry on  ive done as you asked mrs hughes  i think barrows taken it on board  hes getting grander than lady mary and thats saying something  lady grantham hello doctor clarkson  it was bates i saw him watching you  he must have gone straight to the major and sneaked on you the moment your back was turned  oh well some things never change  dont worry hes more vulnerable than when he was last here  why because we know more thats why  why havent you told me till now im not sure  perhaps i envied your ignorance  im not giving up hope not yet  nor me of course but i think we should start to prepare  isobel doesnt know  i havent been able to reach her  have you said anything to mary ediths already told me  has she well i suppose it was too tempting to resist  oddly enough i dont think she was trying to make trouble  we ought to go down its time for the concert  who cares about the stupid concert  the men do and we should too  because we have to keep going whatever happens  we have to help each other to keep going  cora tells me matthews gone missing is that true  theres no proof of anything yet i see  well i need more than that to make me anxious  im glad you would be anxious of course i would be  were used to matthew now god knows who the next heir will be  probably a chimneysweep from solihull huh  most of you wont know how rare it is  to see my sister edith and i pulling together in a double act  a unicorn if ever there was one  but in wartime we like all of you have more important things to worry about  ladies and gentlemen i give you the crawley sisters  well now ive seen everything  sometimes when i feel bad  and things look blue  i wish a pal i had  say one like you  someone within my heart  to build a throne  someone whod never part  to call my own  if you were the only girl in the world  and i were the only boy  nothing else would matter in the world today  we could go on loving in the same old way   thank god  my dear boy my very dear boy  come on dont stop for me  i would say such wonderful things to you  there would be such wonderful things to do  if you were the only girl in the world  and i were the only boy   somehow we got lost  and then we were trapped behind some germans for three days  when we got out of that we stumbled into a field dressing station  where we were immediately admitted  we werent in any danger so they didnt inform our unit  they should have jolly well told us when you got back to base  i hope you werent really worried oh you know us  we like to be sure of our hero at the front  i beg your pardon mlord but the dowager countess is leaving ah  what will you do with the rest of your leave  well since mother isnt here ill run up to london and see lavinia  i got your letter about carlisle i hope youll approve  i know you dont like him much now  i hardly know him  but im sure ill like him when i do thats if hes good to you  if hes not hell have me to answer to  whod have thought an amateur concert could be the summit of all joy  ive lived in such a fog of misery since i left you  i think id forgotten what happiness is me too  but now we must get used to feeling happy and trust it  god i want to  loves young dream i dont think  im not sure i care much  are you going soft in your old age  i dont like him  hes a patronising bastard who sneaks behind my back  but ive got other things to worry about really  thats interesting why  because obviously i hold a grudge longer than you  i knew nothing bad had happened i felt it in my waters  what about you did you have me boxed up and buried  i am glad youre all right honest you should be  its the thought of you that keeps me going  hello hello  ethel what on earth are you doing here  i had to come mrs hughes  im sorry to push in but i was sitting alone until i couldnt stand it no more  youve got to help me i havent got to do anything  but what do you mean help with what  is this about major bryant  i blame myself for not stepping in earlier  that i will admit  how long had it been going on  long enough to get me pregnant  mrs hughes im going to have a baby  i wish id not written that letter now what with everything else going on  shell come up here and make trouble  dont badger me please  sometimes a hard sacrifice must be made for a future thats worth having  the cold and careful lady mary crawley  do you still expect me to marry you knowing this  ill sell my story anyway  about lady mary the turkish gentleman miss smith here  its got nowt to do with me thats not what i heard  mlady wake up what on earth  youd better come downstairs
