                 oh heavens  this is nice its from gwen  shes married  whos gwen she used to work as a housemaid here  she left to be a secretary  thats her ladyship for you miss braithwaite  she says they kept it very quiet because his mothers ill  but she hopes she can introduce us to him in due course  well i think its lovely  we should send her a card ill get one and we can all sign it  sorry i nearly forgot this no harm done  how are you finding it have that lot got used to your promotion yet  some of them but not all eh  ill be fine i dont need to have everyone love me  nor me which is just as well  miss braithwaite  i hope you dont mind but can i give you some advice  go on mr barrow never bothered with you when you were a housemaid but he will now  i should be friendly but keep him at arms length if i were you  id better get on  what do you thinks in it  i cannot say james  its addressed to lady mary so perhaps you could question her later  mr carson  you see the box has been delivered from the late mr crawleys office yes  well ought we to give it straight to lady mary shouldnt someone else see it first  in case theres something in it to make her cry  you may be right ill take it to his lordship and he can decide  i say phyllis dares coming to the theatre royal in york  miss dare will appear in the lady of the rose which was a hit musical of the london season  whos phyllis dare only one of the dare sisters  zena and phyllis dare up here in york  what happened to the other one she married the son of lord esher then retired  oh all right for some  have you truly never heard of them why would i i dont go to the theatre  you must have been sometimes no ive never been  shes got better things to spend her money on  i dont understand you of course you must give it to her  but what if it has no legal status  i dont want to build her hopes up only to have them dashed  robert matthew intended mary to be his sole heiress  that will mean a great deal to her whether or not its legal  cant you see that but is it right to exclude george  well right or not it is what he wanted  besides its not up to you  ill send it to murray  well mary must read it before you send it anywhere  or are you trying to hide from the truth  what truth  that you would prefer to be in sole charge of the estate and not share the crown with mary  dont be silly this wont make any difference to all that  she wont want to get involved  when you talk like that im tempted to ring for nanny and have you put to bed with no supper  goodbye mr grigg thank you doctor  all he needs to put him right is some paid work  its hard for a healthy young man to find a job these days never mind poor old mr grigg  i know thank you  but mrs crawley has things in hand  my guess is that you knew what you were doing bringing him here  mrs hughes wont you come up  oh dont get up for me  what news of charlie mr carson is still very busy but he sends his best wishes  does he  how did he phrase that exactly  well he he said to tell you  he didnt say nothing did he  you have to understand he doesnt remember the days you spent together with any great nostalgia  he thinks it were all my fault but it werent  meaning what  never mind  but it werent my fault  theyre all coming tonight so we have to stretch a dinner by two places  why suddenly i dont know do i  go on about jimmy i just want ivy to know hes not interested in her  he pretends he is because he knows it annoys me how can you be so sure  he hasnt been bothered about her before now has he  sometimes people come around  you hope  i thought the fish seller might be in the village but hes not coming  ill have to go to tuttles in york i can do it  what go to york you can tell mr carson im there on your business  we dont know he can spare you he will if you ask him  hello mr molesley  how are things well as you can see not very good  i dont agree its skilled work  no it isnt not what im doing  im sure if you just wait something better will turn up  i have waited and nothings turned up  i havent earned a penny since mr crawley died and now i owe money all over the village  yes but surely with your  dont you understand im at my wits end  i apologise i should not have said that it was vulgar and selfimportant please forgive me  how much do you owe  what difference does it make 15 20 pounds  more than ive any likelihood of  mr molesley  would it be useful if mr bates and i lent you some money  when would i pay it back give it then  well give you some if you like not much butbut some  i couldnt accept that  but i thank you i do most sincerely  get back to work  anna said you wanted to see me before i go down  yes that is thank you bates that will be all  you know ive invited granny and isobel to dinner i didnt but   well the thing is  there is a letter for you from matthew  what where was it  hidden in a book in the office and so it was overlooked  they finally got round to packing up his things and brought them here this morning  who opened it it wasnt sealed  but youve read it before me yes  i would have sent it to murray to have it looked into  but your grandmother insisted you should see it first  grannys read it too and what do you mean to have it looked into  read it then youll understand  i felt so sorry for him to be in debt like that is the worst thing  molesleys not having much luck  but if he wont accept help then i dont know  im really upset by it  well we cant have that  i dont understand  did matthew leave instructions after all  he left a letter he wrote it before we went to scotland  well where has it been concealed in a book they only dropped off today  papa you read it  my darling mary we are off to duneagle in the morning  and i have suddenly realised that ive never made a will or anything like one  which seems pretty feeble for a lawyer and you being pregnant makes it even more irresponsible  hm im afraid i have to agree with that  ill do it properly when i get back and tear this up before you ever see it  but ill feel easier that ive recorded on paper that i wish you to be my sole heiress  what  i cannot know if our baby is a boy or a girl but i do know it will be a baby  if anything happens to me before ive drawn up a will  and so you must take charge  and now i shall sign this and get off home for dinner with you  what a lovely lovely thought matthew  now you see why i didnt want to read it  but surely it must be legal or do there have to be witnesses  but it was witnessed by two of his clients which is why noone in the office knew it existed  then its settled nothing is settled  this is why i wanted murray to check it first  whatever matthews intentions it is not a will  ive explained to mr carson about the fish and he says you can go  thanks  a pound to a penny hes got some trick up his sleeve youre so suspicious  there are two reasons why hes being so nice to ivy  the first is to make me angry and i dread to think about the second  and i have my reason for getting that to the dining room before midnight  i dont exactly know why but i feel very happy that matthews been allowed a last word  i agree more than i can say  i knew hed have a sensible plan  im not sure how sensible it is  if the letter is valid the estate will have to pay death duties twice before it reaches little george  but in the meantime it will have all the benefit of marys interest  i hope you intend to get stuck in  i want the right to an opinion i shall be content with that  you already have a right to an opinion do i good  most certainly you do in fact theres a question of using empty farmyards as new sources of revenue  id like to know what you feel about that  well id have to think about it   crop rotation livestock versus cereals or indeed the whole matter of the tax  there are lots of things i would like your opinion on  i assume youre trying to make some sort of point  hes trying to show that a womans place is in the home  but she knows a lot about matthews plans  that has value for me  mrs crawley what do you think  im afraid im on marys side robert if sides there must be  there are no sides not at all im pleased if youre pleased im just saying you have some work to do  that is if the letter turns out to be valid  which you very much hope it is not  whats the matter with you  im a stupid fool thats what oh lordy  how did you manage that  daydreaming i dont know what i was about shell be livid  not if you do as i tell you come on  by the way did you get that card for gwen yes why  i thought itd be nice for people in the village to sign it  the bakewells mr molesley that sort of thing  ill collect them you surprise me  why  i never think of you as social  why should i be social when i have you  you wrote to the opera house in belfast  that was enterprising i wrote to a great many theatres  but the manager at the opera house wrote back  it seems theyre in need of a stage door keeper  theyd chosen one but he dropped out he asks mr grigg to consider it  i heard about mr matthews letter i hope it wasnt too upsetting  as a matter of fact it was a relief  i felt so happy that hed finally been heard  but judging by tonights dinner it may prove a heavy mantle for lady mary  i shall keep it on my dressing table to remind me that matthew is on my side  theyre all on your side  papa gave me such a whacking at dinner  your father loves you very much  hes also very glad to have downton back under his control  he always speaks highly of mr matthew and the changes he made  im sure he is very genuine but he thinks he can manage alone now  and the question is can he  you wanted to borrow a belt mlady  lady mary wondered if any of these might suit  thank you  actually im glad that youre here as theres something i want to ask  look what i found in the village today  dont you think it would be the most terrific fun  have you asked her ladyship  shed never let me go at least not without a chaperone but lady edith will be in london  and lady marys not in the mood  but is this quite suitable it looks more like something for servants and farmworkers to me  so theyll dance the onestep wont they  ive practiced and practiced and im dying to try it  wont you accompany me  then if were found out i can say that you came with me so nothing was amiss  of course i cant mlady not without asking lady mary  but that would spoil everything shed be bound to tell lady grantham  please i know you love dancing  and mr bates may have many qualities but hes not a dancer  no mlady he isnt a dancer  but im afraid its quite impossible  but how did it happen i dont like to say mlady  i am truly vexed it was a favourite  i know mlady and im very sorry  but you wont tell me how you did it i cant  very well braithwaite i suppose youd better look me out another  what are you doing im just sorting some old papers i havent looked at these in years  why are you looking now no particular reason  ah i knew i hadnt thrown it away  who was she just a friend at one time  what was she called  alice alice neal  and you were fond of her i was but people drift in and out of your life dont they  truth to tell i felt shed treated me badly  what does it matter anyway  we shout and scream and wail and cry but in the end we must all die  well thats cheered me up  thank you now ill get on with my work  your ladyship mr bates  bates  i am very sorry to interrupt you when youre busy mlady  it concerns mr molesley the younger  you make him sound like a greek philosopher  he has fallen on hard times and i know that you have helped him in the past  are you asking me to give him some money  i am asking for money yes although hes too proud to accept it as a gift  oh how refreshing  although i think we can find a way  morning barrow  good morning mlady  is his lordship in the library he is but erm  what is it  miss braithwaite is very unhappy with good reason  yes but you see  she couldnt explain how it happened because well she didnt want to point the finger  point the finger at whom  well thats just it mlady i dare not either  im in enough trouble with mr bates as it is  youre not saying bates is to blame  not mr bates himself no  anna then but why would she do such a thing  as to that mlady who knows perhaps it was an accident  though they do say theres noone so jealous as a ladys maid  cora is that you  could i ask you something  wheres my scent here you are mlady  oh how stupid of me  that was my clumsiness no it was me  damn now the rooms going to smell like a tarts boudoir  ill clean it up  is it all gone im afraid so  it means a trip to mr roberts theres noone nearer who sells it here  its only york i could go if you like  in fact  what  lady rose asked me if id chaperone her to a the dansant in york today  she didnt want to ask her ladyship but she thought shed get away with it if i went with her  and what did you say that i couldnt go without your permission  well it is rather slow here for a girl her age  go but make sure you keep her out of trouble  go on i know gwend appreciate it  i dont see why i didnt know her that well  but you can sign it surely  and why dont you come over tonight we havent seen you in a while  youre very friendly arent i usually friendly  no youre not discourteous mr bates ill give you that  but youre not friendly except to anna of course  well i shall try to do better in future  see you tonight  mr branson your ladyship  sorry if im late i had to call on old fairclough at roundhills  youre not at all late  now i asked branson to come here because i have an idea  granny you must call him tom  i thought i could call him branson again now that hes the agent  well you cant i dont mind  no i see im beaten but oh how i sympathise with king canute  now what is this idea  well mary either you or your baby son own half of downton  i want you to have a say in the running of it  its just what you need  but didnt last nights dinner disabuse you of that scheme  well thats the point i want er tom tom to be your instructor  what well take mary you know on your rounds  let her learn the farmers difficulties  mmm  explain the crops and the live the livestock  you know let her see the problems facing the estate  and are we to do all this without telling papa  isnt that rather underhand  there can be too much truth in any relationship  mrs crawley  we werent expecting you  her ladyship is lunching with lady ingram his lordship is walking  lady marys at the dower house and lady edith is in london  as a matter of fact its you i came to see  to talk about charles grigg you know hes got a job at the opera house in belfast  hes so anxious to talk to you before he goes  then he is in for a disappointment  he says he is resolved to put his dishonesty behind him  is he now  i know its more than that  he told me hed caused you great unhappiness but he said it was not his fault  he was always a liar  i see  it seems a pity not to take the chance to end a quarrel  isnt it better than to let things fester  i dont mean to speak out of turn mrs crawley  but you will i think accept that any difference between mr grigg and me is my concern  of course it is  im sorry  thank you carson  good day  shall i make us some coffee  you are so domesticated  no not really  monk just lays it all out i only have to pour in the water  i mean it compared to papa youre a famous chef  really he cant boil a kettle  if the servants left hed be found in a passage dead arms stretched out looking for the kitchen  well i hope you can boil a kettle  life with me wont be quite what youre used to  how are things going ah well at least my lawyer thinks so  are you sure about this  the royal family convulses the nation by ceasing to be german and you want to take it up  does it matter that people will hate you for it  will you hate me i will love you more than ever  thats all right then im pretty tough  i may not be used to the splendours of downton but i do know how to look after myself  would you like to see downton where did that come from  well i was thinking if you are nearly german and nearly divorced  perhaps the family should know you a bit  it wont be settled tomorrow my darling i cant pretend it will  dont put me off  arent you curious about my childhood home  im curious about everything to do with you  but my situation would frighten them and we dont want that  i know mamas giving a house party next month why dont you come  then you can blend in and look around  without anyone asking too many questions and mama wont mind she likes you  but your father doesnt  he doesnt know you hell like you when he does  now i must gulp my coffee down and run if im to catch the three oclock  i cant persuade you to stay  but i will say this its getting harder and harder to say no  oh look well take that table  im not sure we should be here mlady it seems unsuitable to me  dont call me mlady call me rose i cant  well then dont call me anything  seen her down there yes  well it is a the dansant lets have a cup of tea all right tea  oh but perhaps with something special in mine right you are miss  listen its the onestep  oh why are they being so slow  really mlady you mustnt be so obvious why not its working  i dont suppose youd care to dance  then youd be wrong because id absolutely love to  shouldnt we be introduced the names sam thawley how do  im rosesmith  hello i hope you know how to do this  youre in luck they call me twinkle toes  hello anna jimmy what are you doing here  i was just picking up some things for mrs patmore shall we dance  wed better if only to check lady rose isnt getting in too deep  im under gardener for lord ellis near easingwold what about you  im at im at downton abbey  oh yeah what do you do are you a ladys maid  you sound posh enough do i im so pleased ive  ive worked and worked on my accent  ah youve done well you could pass for a real lady never mind a ladys maid  im not a ladys maid yet anna is the girl im with but i wonder if im clever enough  ah well you wont be a housemaid forever i expect youve got a few young farmers hanging about  i couldnt say you wont say you mean  james how how how did you find us  i saw you across the square mlady rose was saying what fun it is to be out like this  i thought id pop in to see what the craic was  its a good craic isnt it sam  well it is with you in my arms  i love the view from up here  if you know the view all the better  follow that hedge  to the left of it is oakwood farm to the right is all farmed by us  do we want to take over oakwood farm no  the olds are good tenants and hard workers  mm  there is one subject we ought to discuss  i know your position isnt settled but we should go on  the death duties if you are the heir it wont change them  theres no special treatment for widows you do not surprise me  it seems odd really that you have to pay just as much tax  as if hed left it all to mrs tiggywinkle down the road  mm but thats how it works  so what are we to do  your father believes we should sell land and pay it off in one lump  but you dont i want to know what you think  ive some good tickets for me and ivy  to see phyllis dare i dont believe you  well i have it cost a packet and no mistake  does ivy know not yet  mate lets have a dance eh  sorry im dancing with her i said let her dance with me  i dont want to dance with you  how do you know if youve not even tried it  dont tell me youre falling for her at last she will be pleased  i said leave her alone thats the idea  out the way come on then  sam are you ok get off me get off my hand  get off him sam get off get off sam get her out of here  get off him come here you james  i cant leave when hes fighting to protect me  you can or do you want to be arrested  we need to get out of here  that settles it come on go go go  mr molesley is that you come in and have a cup of tea  mr bates thought i might be welcome and so you are sit down  mr molesley im glad youre here  i was going through my desk this afternoon  and i came upon that note of mine and er if youre willing id like to pay it off now  what note well you lent me some money when i was first came here  and im sorry i havent paid it back before now but the truth is im afraid i forgot  i dont remember anything about it 30 arent you the lucky one  surely there must be some mistake  youll not deny thats your signature plain as day  how was your trip to york never mind that whats going on  mr bates has remembered he owed 30 to mr molesley what  but but but no er there you are and thank you for coming to my aid when i needed it  now i must go i have some things to do before his lordship comes up  thank you mr molesley  mr carson can i have a word certainly james  why did you do that  you have put up with so much that i couldnt change  so if there is ever the slightest thing i can make better for you then i will  but how did you manage it dont i keep telling you prison was an education  take her to the theatre it is my half day  but not hers and how do we know shed want to go shell want to go  she could change her half day oh i dont know  its turning into liberty hall round here  are we entertaining that night  im not cooking theyll all be dining with lady lawson at brough hall  very well but no lingering  you can go and give her the good news thank you mr carson  i hope he doesnt break her heart  we must all have our hearts broken once or twice before were done  true enough mrs hughes  strange to think the theatre was part of my life at one time  yours and mr griggs  you know hes going to work in belfast  i had heard hes leaving the village in the morning  the 11 oclock train whats that to me  ill tell you what it is its an open wound  i dont know why but i do know this  youd do better to stitch it up and let it heal  im sorry mlord i didnt hear the gong its all right it hasnt gone yet  i was hoping to catch you  of course i understand how tiresome it must have been for anna  when edna came back and was suddenly the senior ladys maid  mlord ask her to go easy  im sorry mlord but i dont understand what youre saying  her ladyship appears to think theres been some bad feeling between braithwaite and anna  that anna has been a little unkind not that i know of  look i dont want to make a thing of it im just asking for a little consideration thats all  and you shall have it mlord good thats all i needed to hear  ah theres the gong now  i just cant believe youre letting me go do you really mean it  no i was having you on  oh dont be so soft ive said you can go and you can go  what should i wear clothes  but i havent got anything right not for the theatre in york its not covent garden  what oh never mind well make you look presentable  now get that parsley  i dont know why shes so excited its only a bloomin play  hes just as keen on her as ever well see nothings as changeable as a young mans heart  take hope and a warning from that  ill get it  yes i was wondering if i could have a word with the housemaid rose  the housemaid rose the maid rose who works here  look chum ill deal with it mr barrow  hello mr thawley  well ill leave you to it  ive got to know shes all right  rose is a bit busy just now but ill tell her you asked  i dont mind waiting  can i er can i come in  if youll just stay there ill ill see what shes up to  anna what what is it  the man you were dancing with sam thawley hes downstairs  but why what what does he want  he says hes come to make sure that youre all right  what have you done with him left him in the yard before he asks the others any questions  but what can i say what can i do  come with me ive got an idea  this is so very kind of you i had to come  you know i had to see that you were er you know all right after that ruckus  and iand i am thanks to you  i never saw anything so brave as the way you punched that horrid man  id do more than that for you  how very flattering  where did you grow up you dont sound very yorkshire  dont i thats  thats because my lifes been sort of spent all over the place  north south east west  homes the place that i love best  what thats how the song goes  yes ii suppose it is  would you let me call on you again  well look i know im not good enough for you i can see that  but im a steady chap ask lord elliss agent  hed give me a good reference im sure but itsits something else  do you remember wondering if any of the local farmers were after me  yeah well thats the thing i  there is one farmer and i didnt want to spoil this afternoon by mentioning it  but i have rather given him my word  well thats me back in my box then i hope you understand  course i do hes a lucky bloke thats all ill say  well good luck then its been nice knowing you  you too  mr thawley sam  when you do find someone someone much nicer and better than i am  shell be a very lucky girl  what the  say nothing and ill be your friend forever  is lord grantham in the drawing room yes mlady thank you  ah here she is  oh darling ah are you only just back  we sat forever outside peterborough we never found out why  shall i change no dont bother its only us  and who are we to warrant any courtesy dont be difficult granny  wheres rose have we lost her  im so sorry im late never mind never mind  now ive got you all here and before carson comes in i have something to say  i had a letter today from murray  wait just a moment while i finish  shall i leave my lord no you might as well hear this  murray has taken matthews letter to various authorities  and their conclusion is that it demonstrates testamentary intention whats that  it means that the writer intended the document to serve as a will  so the bequest stands yes mary owns half the estate  that sounds like a very good result and now we should go into dinner before mrs patmore blows a gasket  dearest papa i hope youre not too disappointed  dont be silly not at all  perhaps the three of us can sit down tomorrow and talk properly  of course but the main problem is a simple one tax  but thats it toms told me you want to sell land to pay for it  its the only way im afraid yes but you see i dont agree  anyway lets not talk about it now we ought to join the others  if youve put her up to this  i havent put her up to anything but you wont keep her quiet not now the bits between her teeth  dont think that you will  i dont know what he meant you must have said something  but i havent said anything  i warned her off mr barrow thats all but i wasnt having a go at her  all i can tell you is that she has managed to take offence  she cant have  mr barrow what are you doing down here  will you come up this moment and help me serve the wine  sorry mr carson im on my way  whats so funny  nothing mr bates  nothing at all  good morning carson  i hope im not in the way not a bit you remember mr grigg  hello charlie good of you to come  im delighted but im not surprised  arent you because im astonished  but why did you never speak of alice when we last met before the war  what was the point she chose you all those years ago and that was it  why bring it up because it wasnt it  she chose me but it never worked  shes dead now anyway but it was never it  i didnt know she was dead five year ago  wed separated long before but i went to see her in st thomass  do you know what she said  she said charlie carson was the better man i could have loved him  i did love him really but i was a fool and couldnt see it  did she say that honestly  that she loved you aye she did  and she wanted me to tell you if i saw you again  there we are we could have made a go of it you know  as long as you know that it were her choice i never set out to take her off you  all aboard  i am sorry to interrupt but i think you must get aboard  i cant tell you how grateful i am mrs crawley very good luck  thank you  i doubt well meet again but can we shake on it  weve known some ups and downs together its true  but if this is goodbye  lets part as friends eh  all right  i wish you well likewise  charlie  mrs crawley i should be grateful  if you would let me know any expense you have been put to on mr griggs behalf during his stay with you  oh no thats completely unnecessary i should be grateful  very well carson i shall do that  good day to you  mr carson  shall we walk back together  i gather the abbey is once more to be a scene of great splendour  whos the glamorous pirate johnnie gillinghams son  stick it under my arm if you can youre an angel from above  i dont know about that is there anyone who wants to dance  what about it how can grown men throw away their fortune like that what could be more stupid  theres something about him that gets my goat he was just trying to be nice  i dont want them to spend it seems disloyal to matthew  screaming in the servants halls what a topsyturvy world weve come to
