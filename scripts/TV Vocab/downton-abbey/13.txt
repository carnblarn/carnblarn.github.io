                i shall have arms like jack johnson if im not careful  im strong enough to wheel myself  ill be the judge of that  morning  i keep thinking about william  how he should be here  not exactly instead of me  but sacrifice should be rewarded  he was the brave one  you were both brave  i dont think we can say should about things that happen in war  it just happens and we should live with it  ought i to be jealous  im sorry what were we talking about  i was asking about haxby park im taking mary over there tomorrow  our haxby park why are the russells selling  not officially but i am told theyre open to offers  sad the russells and the crawleys have been neighbours for centuries  theyre not living there any more itll be strange for mary  shes been going to that house since she was a girl in a party dress  we all have theres nowhere better near downton  im not sure how comfortable it is  itll be comfortable when im finished with it  central heating modern kitchens  bathrooms with every bedroom its all possible  sounds more like an hotel  major clarkson  good morning lord grantham  lady edith sir  weve had a request  a canadian major has asked to come here  because of a family link with the house  weve taken officers from his regiment before  but i wanted to be sure youd no objection  whats his name gordon  patrick gordon  he was with princess patricias canadian light infantry at passchendaele  caught in a blast and burned rather badly i believe  poor fellow well hes perfectly welcome  im not aware of how we are connected but you never know  sir  ive never worked in a house where a valet and a housemaid were wed  itll be unusual i agree  i hope it doesnt break us up  having you two set apart in a home of your own all special  while the rest of us muddle on for ourselves  you sound as if youre jealous  im not jealous i just dont want it to spoil things  why because weve all been such pals until now  give her time  matthews making such progress  i think so but are we doing enough for him  for all of them when it comes to rehabilitation  theyre going to have to face a very different world after the war  i agree but theyll all be leaving downton soon  leaving well turkeys about to capitulate  and robert says vittorio veneto will finish austria  so its only a matter of weeks even days before its over  we wouldnt send anyone home too soon of course  but some time in the new year we will have our house back  so you want it just to be a private house again  shouldnt she  or would you like to abolish private houses  well that life of changing clothes and killing things and eating them  do you really want it again  wouldnt you rather downton was useful the house is useful  we provide employment please  let me look into keeping it open as a centre of recovery  i could run it the house could be so much more than it was before  what about you molesley  are you looking forward to  this brave new world of mrs crawleys imaginings  im glad of my job mlady  and i should very much like to hold onto it  with mrs crawleys permission  servants are always far more conservative than their employers  everyone knows that  then i must be the exception that proves the rule  hello  my names edith craw  lady edith crawley i know  second daughter of the house  in charge of nonmedical welfare  so whatever you need in the way of errands run or books to read  then im your man  thank you  i hope this doesnt put you off  i can assure you at this stage there isnt much that puts me off  did they tell you were related  yes but im afraid im not much good at family history  although papas found an aunt in 1860 who married a gordon  perhaps thats a clue  no that isnt it  well as i say im hopeless  ii thought youd recognise my voice  but of course i sound canadian now  you mean weve met before  it was a long time ago  edith i need you  it just explains what youre entitled to  thats kind but lets face it im not a widow am i not really  of course you are no im not  how long was i married six hours seven  i shouldnt have taken his name except it were what he wanted  well ill leave it wi you  daisy  it wouldnt please william if you dont take whats owing  he wanted you to be looked after  no you made me a liar while he was alive  youll not make me be false to his memory  you can leave me brooks yes sir  mr bates said you wanted to see me sir  yes  i asked you up here because i want to offer you a job  i have a job sir  yes of course you do im sure you enjoy it  i dont mean to suggest im offering a better one  thank you  although it would mean a considerable increase in salary  lady mary and i intend to buy a home near downton  its a long way from london  but ive made enough money to please myself these days  i know she holds you in high regard  i believe she would very much appreciate your help  when she first sets up house as a bride  you mean you wish me to leave downton abbey and transfer  tomorrow we go to see haxby park  if we buy it well take on the whole 12000 acres  no doubt you will discover many interesting walks to enjoy  of course its run down  but theres nothing wrong with it that money cant fix  so what do you think  one thing i must ask  is lady mary aware that you have approached me  not yet  i wanted to surprise her  she thinks highly of you carson  i hope i wont be taking on a rival  i await lady marys instruction  i dont dislike him i just dont like him which is quite different  did he talk about haxby  hes got ghastly plans for the place of course cora doesnt agree  im an american i dont share your english hatred of comfort  downtons comfortable enough for me i cant wait to have it back  thats if cousin isabelle allows it  she turned up today with a hideous list of projects  that stretched to 1920 and beyond  surely you can put her off  i dont know how once the bits between her teeth  well change the bridle  find a cause that needs her more than downton  shes such a martyr  then we must tempt her with a more enticing scaffold  were safe weve got the decree nisi  im sure its all right  except youre not sure  not sure about what  what about you sergeant have you started planning for after the war  not really not yet  i know what you should be doing  i know what we should all be doing  yeah whats that  hoarding  it may be wrong but this rationing is starting to bite  even with everyones books  i had a battle to get enough sugar for this week  are you suggesting the black market mrs patmore  im shocked  i doubt that very much  im sorry i couldnt get down this week but weve had a house full  whos looking after the baby my neighbour  shes lent me her bike so i can get back  well youd best be off  i cant darling ive got too much work  were losing two of the nurses and they must rearrange the roster  if marys out with carlisle  and ediths going to mamas ill be on my own  what about sybil sybils on duty  i wish youd told me i couldve fixed something up for myself  you could always ask major clarkson to join you  if you really cant be on your own for one luncheon ill manage  its so empty  i didnt know theyd gone  theyve given up  you cant blame them  when billy was killed it knocked the stuffing out of them completely  whatll we do about furniture and pictures and everything  what does anyone do  buy it i presume  your lot buys it my lot inherits it  we ought to be getting back  why  whats at downton that needs your attention so urgently  so  shall we rescue it  shall we give the house another chapter  well i suppose one has to live somewhere  youre telling me weve been feeding ethel for some time  we have mlady  well supplementing her food  i didnt think youd mind what with the baby and all  but mr carson suggested youd like to be informed all the same  carson is right mrs hughes  but the girl was our employee and while she was in the wrong  indeed she was men will always be men  but for any young woman to let her judgement so desert her  shes not the first girl to be taken in by a uniform  and dont worry carson the baby will make sure she pays the price  has she tried to get the father to assume some responsibility  shes tried and failed im afraid  i wonder  if i were to write to major bryant inviting him to visit us again  maybe lord grantham can prevail on his good nature  im not sure hes got one to prevail on  satisfied i feel sorry for ethel  but i cannot condone her inability  to pronounce a simple twoletter word no  the wine delivery shouldve been here by 12  get me out of the dining room when they come  serve the main course and let jane finish he wont mind  has carson abandoned me  hes dealing with a wine delivery mlord  shall i fetch him no no i daresay well manage  i hope youre happy here  and that your family arrangements are not proving too complicated  your lordship has a good memory  all our lives are lived around our children  how old is your son   is he at the local school  he is but hes trying for a scholarship to ripon grammar  is that a realistic prospect  i think so  he has a real talent for mathematics and  his teachers believe its worth a try  well done him im impressed  perhaps i can put in a word  im sure i should say he wants to do it all by himself  but im not proud so if you can say anything mlord  then for heavens sake do  jane have you finished in here  i hope she wasnt talking out of turn mlord  not at all it was my fault i asked the questions  but surely if his lordship asks him he must do something  why what difference will it make  were not in the 14th century  but when he hears that lord grantham knows what hes done  whats he done that all young men arent anxious to do  behind the bicycle sheds every night  what am i going to do if major bryant doesnt come round  who knows  go to a big city  invent a past  youve broken the rules my girl  and its no good pretending theyre easily mended  mr bates theres a telephone call for you its your lawyer  shall i come with you  lady mary was looking for you  when was this  when she got back from her outing  were you going to keep it a secret all day  im going to fetch my button box  thank you  any letters to post  look  i know ive changed and not for the better but even so  do you really still not recognise me  i know why am i feeling so silly  its funny isnt it  i came here all the time when i was growing up  you were here  at downton  youre not saying that youre  patrick  yes i am  thats exactly what im saying  ive just been hoping youd realise without my having to spell it out  but patricks  dead drowned on the titanic  of course this must be very hard for you  thats ridiculous  no im sorry of course im not saying its your fault  its mine its all mine  yes  thank you  goodbye  shes gone and told the judge that i paid her to agree to a divorce  i suppose you did didnt you yes i bloody well did  so what does it mean  because we withheld it from the court  it means the judge can withdraw the decree nisi  it means im not divorced after all  above all it means that i am a stupid stupid stupid man  this wont change a thing  we are going to be together whether she wants it or not  if we have to leave here  if we have to leave the country  we are going to be together  i was on the titanic that much is true  but i was pulled out of the water by fifth officer lowe  the only one of them to come back  at least thats what they said later  when i properly came round theyd misidentified me as canadian  and shipped me up to montreal i dont understand  why didnt you just tell them who you were  because i couldnt remember  i dont know if it was the blow to the head  or the shock or the cold but i had no memory  as far as i knew i was canadian  so so what happened  well i had no reason to go back to england  so in the end i took my name from a gin bottle  then in 1914 i joined princess pats infantry  and what changed  i was caught in a big explosion at passchendaele  when i woke up  it all came back  suddenly i knew who i was  i began to call myself patrick again  why not your whole name  why didnt you send a message at once  i nearly did  and then i heard that downton was an officers convalescent home  i thought that if i came here and you knew me  the hard part would be over  but we didnt know you  precisely  i must talk to papa  weve matthew the new heir to think about  the new heir yes  this will be very difficult for him of course  it must be so hard for you what with mary getting married  did i love her very much  well im the wrong person to ask  because you were the one who really loved me you mean  i never thought patrick knew  well he did  ii do  its big  the staircase is prettier than the one here  but mainly its just big can we stop  id much rather see your face when we talk  so will you buy it  probably  he says he wants to steal carson to come and run it for us  i dont envy you telling your papa  suppose carson wont do it  since he would open his veins for you  i dont think theres much doubt  i dont have to marry him you know  yes you do  if i thought for a moment that i was an argument against your marriage  i should jump into the nearest river  and how would you manage that without my help  id get you to push me  seriously i can only relax  because i know that you have a real life coming  if i ever thought i was putting that in jeopardy  id go away and never see you again  you dont mean that but i do  i am the cat that walks by himself  and all places are alike to me  i have nothing to give and nothing to share  if you were not engaged to be married  i wouldnt let you anywhere near me  youd think he was in marys sole charge  i worry itll mean a big adjustment for him when we marry  i dont believe matthew has any desire  to stop her marrying richard  quite the contrary  maybe but is she as convinced as he is that they have no future  what are you saying  i suppose im asking whether you want mary to have children  because if you do  isnt it time for lavinia swire to come back into his life  i wish i knew how an engine worked  i can teach you if youd like  thats ediths territory  i thought you were avoiding me  of course not  but you havent come up with an answer yet have you  not yet im afraid  i know you want to play your part in irelands troubles  and i respect that  but i just cant think about it all until the war is over  it wont be long now  so will you wait  id wait forever  im not asking for forever  just a few more weeks  you know old ma patmores not as mad as i thought  why do you say that  ive made some enquiries and shes right  theres a big demand for rationed food if i can find it  and can you  maybe ive been given a name  ill have to come up with the money though  and can you find the money  i think so  ive a bit put by and i could borrow some  its a risk though isnt it  youve gotta speculate to accumulate  hadnt you heard  no but i know the one about neither a borrower or a lender be  what do you think  all the chaps are wearing them in london  only for informal evenings of course  im not sure youll get much use out of it when the war is over  maybe not but i can wear it when her ladyship and i are on our own  youre very preoccupied tonight  papa can i have a word now  what is it  i think youd better sit down  i knew youd be in here  making lastminute adjustments  never leave anything to chance  mlady thats my motto  mine too really  sometimes i wish it wasnt  i gather sir richards asked you about coming with us  when were married  i need to hear what you think  its a terrific idea  if anyone can keep me out of trouble its you  what about his lordship  of course hell kill me  but im sure hell understand  well  ill give you my answer when youve spoken to his lordship  itd be a huge wrench for me to leave downton  major gordon  edith has given me an account of your conversation  she said she would  i wish youd spoken to me first  obviously i need time to consider what youve said  well i can offer little proof  except that i know things only the real patrick would know  i was never fingerprinted or anything  presumably you understand that people would be seriously affected  should your story be true  you mean cousin matthew it would be very hard on matthew  of course it would but robert  ii mean lord grantham if youd prefer it  i would until we know more  when i was in hospital i had my story written down  so you can have it checked as far as thats possible  thank you  ill send it to my lawyers in london  and ill break the news to the family tomorrow  where did you learn to do that  do what  never mind  am i really a stranger  do you not recognise me at all  it feels very odd to be talking so formally  the whole situation is certainly odd that i freely admit  the war may be at an end but the upheaval is only beginning  how right you are  that is why downton abbey still has such an important role to play  dear me  theres so much to be done  when you think of all the children laid up with disease  but theyre making such advances now arent they  could we talk about the lecture programme if we must we must  if only i wasnt haunted by those women  whose jobs will be snatched from them when the boys come home  we have to find work for our heroes dont we  that must be our priority however hard that might sound  as you say  and what about those wretched refugees  what will become of them  now youve struck a chord  have i really thank heaven  what do you mean nothing  only the thought of those poor men and women  flung across europe far from their homelands  and so much in need of your help  my help why do you say that  when it comes to helping refugees  your experience renders your value beyond price  one of the organisers said those words  which organiser  i forget  but what about running downton i mean i cant do both  well i suppose you must decide what it more important  exercise classes and lectures on pottery  or helping men and women build a new life  i must go but i will think about it  are you coming to cousin roberts dinner tonight  are you well i didnt feel i could say no  he sent a note this morning and was most insistent whats it about  i have no idea but well talk there  were onto something for you  we mustnt let the iron grew cold  thank you  you know there is nothing more illbred  than to steal other peoples servants  but youre not other people and carson brought me up  what does he say that he wont do anything without your permission  which of course is so cunning  how can i refuse a man who says that  what do you say bates  i say mr carson must have the last word on where he lives and works  youre ganging up on me  youre a darling and i love you  now whats this dinner all about  wont you tell me youll find out  im sorry if its a bit of a crush  i didnt want to be overheard  are we talking financial ruin  or criminal investigation  neither ill get straight to the point  we have a patient who has been badly burned  who goes by the name of patrick gordon  but he claims to be patrick crawley  but i thought he was dead  didnt he drown on the titanic  well of course it is what we all thought until now  they never found a body  they never found lots of bodies  im so sorry but im not quite on top of this  whos patrick crawley  the man who would displace me as heir  if hes alive then i am no longer the future earl of grantham  its ridiculous  how can it be true wheres he been hiding for the last six years  in canada suffering from amnesia  he does have a story that would explain it  but im not quite sure about how to test the facts  he knows all sorts of things that only patrick  or someone very close to him would know  what a stupid thing to say  any fortune teller at a fair  comes up with a dozen details he couldnt possibly know  theres no need to be angry  this young man is either patrick of hes not  there must be a way to find out  is he like patrick to look at  he isnt like anything to look at  ive sent his account off to george murray in london to ask his advice  what a waste of time and money  whats the matter we were all so fond of patrick  you were going to marry him for heavens sake  arent you glad if he survived dear me  should i be worried certainly not  this man is a fake and an imposter  i think its a cruel trick to play when matthews been through so much  my dear dont be too quick to decide  you never know this might be a blessing in disguise  what do you mean well he seems a nice enough chap  hes not very pretty of course  but he can walk round the estate on his own two legs  and sire a string of sons to continue the line  id say thats a great improvement on the current situation  sybil could i prevail on you to take me back to my room  of course  mrs hughes weve had a letter in the evening post  from major bryants father  he must have found it hard to write for it seems  the major has been killed in the battle of vittorio veneto  how sad im sorry to hear it  i know and right at the end but there we are  im afraid its the end of our story too  what story is that mlady  a friend of mrs hughes knew the major  can you relay the news of course  will that be all yes thank you  is that the major bryant that ethel always thought so handsome mlady  too handsome for anyones good  i beg your pardon your lordship i thought everyone had gone up  not yet  is there anything i can fetch you  nothing that would help  never mind me good night  not a shock exactly but obviously it was a tremendous surprise  so what happens next  papa sent your statement up to his solicitor  what is it do you remember this place  of course i do  how we used to hide over there  wasnt there a governess none of you liked  fraulein kelder  thats it  fraulein kelder  what fun we used to make of her  do you know i do recognise you now  do you  you havent changed at all  not a jot  god knows i have  its not important  edith if you really mean it  do you think once its all settled we might talk again  but if theyve read her ladyships letter wont his parents know  i dont think so she only invited him to pay a visit  she thought the subject of the baby would come better face to face  could i write to them  you could try but wheres your proof  with him dead youve no evidence at all  then im ruined  you were ruined already my girl so dont lets us go overboard  hows that new maid getting on the lady with the little boy  very well thank you why  just thinking  everyone wants to help her to feed her to find her work  because her sons father is dead so is the father of my son  wheres the difference  the difference is jane is a respectable married woman  that some man chose to be his wife  is that enough  it is in the real world  carson now i wonder if i could be put on the london train  at 9 oclock tomorrow morning  his lordships valet is catching that one  would you object to his riding in the front with the chauffeur  not at all meanwhile have you given my proposition any thought  a great deal sir richard  ill be back on the night of 10th  perhaps you could let me have your answer then  answer to what as to whether carson will be captain of our ship  with you at the helm theres much more chance of a smooth crossing  your lordship i need to go to london tomorrow  ive spoken to mr carson he has no objection  please say this concerns property and not the former mrs bates  i only wish she was the former mlord  or better still the late  indeed  i have to reason with her ive found no other choice  shes found a reason to delay things again  no not delay  shes found a way to ruin things  be sensible bates  above all do not lose your temper  a german republic  no i dont think so mr branson  the kaiser will go ill grant you  and maybe the crown prince too but therell be a regency  mark my words  monarchy is the lifeblood of europe sorry mr carson  but i think youll find the kings and emperors have had their day  if president wilson has anything to say about it  ill have to go up to london  what will you say to her that you havent said already  i dont know but i know staying here wont make any difference  youre always going to london mr bates i have business in london  yes well judging by your expression  your business doesnt seem to be prospering  the trick of business is to mind your own  im sorry to disturb you but i  ive just heard news from the war office  and i thought youd all like to know  that the war is over  the ceasefire will begin  at 11 oclock on the morning of the 11th of november  why cant it begin now  the 11th of the 11th seems pretty tidy to me  we will mark the moment in the great hall  and i expect all of you  including the kitchen staff and hall boys  everyone to be there  and carson  its such wonderful news  is there any more glasses up there  we should make a toast together  to peace  to peace  the truth is cora there is a reason for inviting you here today  and i fear im going to be a great disappointment to you  cousin violet is in part to blame yes i usually am  it was she who drew my attention to the plight of the war refugees  i feel very guilty since i chivvied you  and now im jumping ship but i cant run downton as well  you must go where you can make a difference  this is what i think  but i hope you will consider keeping the house open without me  i must be honest with you it was your idea not ours  so i doubt very much well go on with it now  but what does that matter  when one thinks of the work youll be doing  dont you agree mama  ii cannot find the words to say how i feel  what  what do you think molesley  sometimes fate knows best mlady  i couldnt put it better myself  well  there really is something for her to do  absolutely its all set up  i had to promise to be a patron but it seemed a small price to pay  i know it was for robert and the girls  but i thank you without irony  from the bottom of my heart  and i accept your thanks my dear  with no trace of irony either  lawyers take forever to answer anything  so they can charge more  but the others dont believe me do they  not like you  i think they want to be certain  but how can they ever be  if the lawyer casts even the slightest doubt  wont that give them the excuse to cut me out and stay with matthew  if only one of them recognised me  they will do soon  no they wont theyve forgotten me  im a stranger to them now  well youre not a stranger to me  i wouldnt be vera bates  he left here at dawn with a face like thunder  i wonder if she knows what shes started  if i were you id keep out of it  wise words  how did you get on yeah it was interesting  daisy i wish youd let me tell you about it  theres no point no point in what  jane keeps making out im a war widow but im not am i  you all know that  i married william on his deathbed that dont count  course it counts i dont think so  and i wasnt good to him  he thought i loved him but i didnt not like he loved me  i should never have married him in the first place only  marrying him was a great kindness  no it wasnt kind  it was wrong  mr bates how did you get here  i walked from the station  you shouldve said wed have sent someone to meet you  i was glad of the walk i was glad of the air  i never thought youd be back tonight  how was it  worse than you can possibly imagine  whats  i assume that whatever mr murray has told you means the man is a fake  you cant have asked matthew to be here unless you know that  its very complicated  lowe was the only officer to go back to the site of the wreck  he did pull some people out of the sea  and it seems one of the men was unidentified there  one of the reports has him dying before they reached the carpathia  precisely  another witness says the man did get to new york alive  but theres no clear record of his name  which could be patrick crawley theres more  there was a peter gordon who worked with patrick at the foreign office  now he emigrated to montreal in 1913  yes and when his face was blown away  he decided every cloud has a silver lining  he was perfectly placed to impersonate his dead friend  no doubt they shared confidences so he just brushed them up  and put himself forward for a major inheritance  grannys right  all he needed was a survivor from the titanic  who was unaccounted for and he found one  but the titanic story bears out patricks version in every way  what do you think  i dont know what to think  how can you even hesitate  but mary you havent heard the things he remembers  i dont need to  i remember how we played and your pony and your birthday  and how we hid in the garden from the nasty governess  what other memories would you have of a childhood spent here  murray will continue to investigate so edith  can we be polite to the man but nothing more  the end of the war should make it easier to unearth the evidence  that is all for the time being  i thought carlisle was going to come back for our ceremony tomorrow  hes driving up hell be here in time for dinner tonight  im sorry i cant be more decisive  dont be i meant what i said the other day  itll take a man who is more than i am now to follow you  so dont think about me  my dear chap how can you say that  i never think about anything else  what do they make of this peter gordon character theyve uncovered  do they think thats who i am  do you remember him  very well  peter and i were good friends  very good friends  did you know hed moved to canada  how could i when id forgotten who i was until two months ago  of course  so what will they do now  track him down i imagine  find out what happened to him  suppose he joined the princess pat light infantry  i dont understand what are you saying  why would he  youre very sweet you know  so sweet you made me think that all things were possible  but perhaps the lesson is you cant go back  youre tired and i dont blame you but youre not to give up  i wont let you  well find this peter gordon i know we will  yes  i expect you will  theyll be going in to dinner in a minute  weve built a good cellar here you know  im not saying its legendary but its nothing to be ashamed of  youve made your mind up then  i think so yes  i think i have  but with a heavy heart mrs hughes  and just when we thought we were getting back to normal  dont tell me youll miss me  i will mr carson  very much  and it costs me nothing to say it  thank you  that means a lot to me  shall we go through with the ladies and let them get in here of course  i wonder what happened to richard  hell have started late and  i do apologise lady grantham  we got stuck in royston and a cart had overturned in baldock  hello my dear how lovely to see you  are you sure  sir richard said you were expecting me but are you  of course we are  can you take matthew into the small library are you hungry  weve finished but mrs hughes can easily put something on a tray  carson  nothings changed  but you see it has because ive changed  when i was last here  i was so bowled over that i let you send me away  but not this time  i love you  im going to look after you thats all there is to it  and if i refuse  im sorry but i mean it  you wont frighten me away whatever you do  it seems such a waste of time to drive from london  and get stuck in every town on the way  i dont agree id love to drive  and youd better agree if anthony strallen comes back into your life  before you scold me its no good pretending  mary is not too attached to matthew  so you summon lavinia  to be sacrificed like some latterday iphigenia  doomed to push his chair through all eternity  robert its quite simple  do you want marys marriage to be a success  do you want grandchildren  sometimes cora you can be curiously unfeeling  suppose he doesnt want her back have you thought of that  he needs someone to look after him yes but  youll be too busy with our new life  i know youre used to having your own way yes i am  ill say something now i hope i wont have to repeat  if you think you can jilt me or in some way set me aside  i tell you now you have given me the power to destroy you  dont think i wont use it  i want to be a good husband and for you to be happy  but dont ever cross me do you understand  never  absolutely never  whats happened to major gordon  hes gone  but he cant have  when  after breakfast  i couldnt very well stop him the wars over  he left this for you  what does it say  it was too difficult  im sorry  p gordon  p for patrick or p for peter  i know what you think but i dont accept it  we drove him away  his own family drove our cousin away  but you believed in him whoever he was  and thats worth something  i think while the clock strikes we should all make a silent prayer  to mark the finish of this terrible war  and what that means for each and every one of us  let us remember the sacrifices that have been made  and the men who will never come back  and give them our thanks  thank you everyone  remember this is not just the end of a long war  but it is the dawn of a new age  god bless you all  let me help you with that  can you get him back to his room  ill open the door  my god  is something wrong sir  no nothing  bates if i felt  if you felt what sir  it doesnt matter not yet  not until i feel it again
