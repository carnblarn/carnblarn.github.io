                 thank god yes thank god  and you  how do we speak to him normally  how do you think you speak to him  do we pretend prison never happened  i dont think thatll be necessary  welcome back mr bates  ive waited a long time to say that thank you mr carson  too long give us your coat  oh mrs patmore can you find something for mr bates to eat  i certainly can daisy ivy stir your stumps  whos ivy the new kitchen maid  thomas still here i see  mr barrow now mr bates and yes im still here  and busy as a bee  there have been some changes since er since youve been away  you will have heard about lady sybil  yes ive heard  anna took a letter from me to her ladyship  there we are thank you mrs patmore  can we all have one of those  welcome back mr bates thank you daisy  something nice  the editors written back repeating his offer  he asks if im ever in london  why not you could see rosamund and buy some new clothes  he only wants to persuade you to write for his horrible paper  still i think i will go  it seems rude not to in a way and i havent been to london for ages  excuse me  please dont encourage her  i think its a good idea  i gather youve trapped poor old jarvis into a meeting  it wont take long but he is the agent  and there are things we must get started on if you agree  well im glad you still think my agreement has a part to play  are you sure you wouldnt rather just cut and run like me  bates my dear fellow  i didnt know you were here already they let you out at dawn  thank you for sending anna in the car  oh nonsense where have they put you  in my old room mlord that wont do  ill ask jarvis how far theyve got with finding a cottage thank you  about thomas ill sort it out bates i promise  but in the meantime you just rest  stay in bed read books  but you didnt walk out of my luncheon when robert asked you to  well that luncheon was to support cora in her grief  it did not seem appropriate to let the whole thing  end in chaos and a quarrel  so you dont think i should have given ethel a second chance  i do not criticise your motives but did you really consider  ethel is notorious in the village  i dont think so i know so  you have surrounded this house with a miasma of scandal  and touched all of us by association  i think one must fight for ones beliefs  and is poor ethel to be the cudgel by which you fight your foes  ah ethel  i was just telling lady grantham how your cooking has come on  im studying mlady these days a working woman must have a skill  but you seem to have so many  i dont see how you can just sack him  hes done nothing wrong  he cant have expected to stay my valet once bates was released  ask carson hell have some ideas  poor little girl  has branson said anything more about moving out  how can he move before hes found a job how can you want him to  hes our responsibility now robert  he and the baby  we owe that to sybil  i must get on ive got this meeting with jarvis and matthew  have you got any plans mr bates  its rather early to say his lordship suggested i have a rest  i expect youll be looking for something to do mr barrow  now that mr bates is back  theyre showing a film tonight in the village hall way down east  its about a woman who survives in the wilderness  through her own wits and courage blimey theyve stolen my story  lillian gish is in it i like her  theres a late showing tonight at half past ten  for the local servants what about it  are you going jimmy sounds a bit soppy to be honest  well im not going with alfred on my own  my mum wouldnt like it she would not and nor would i  you may go if madge or alice will go with you  but not otherwise all right if mrs patmore agrees  straight there and back mind  this means the overhaul of every part of the estate we hold in hand  and some large new parcels in addition  all in an instant  but dont you see if we invest in new machinery  new methods and new techniques  the whole estate must benefit by it  and as for taking new lands in hand we wont be running it separately  well find another use for some of the farmhouses  this is ridiculous downton has existed for hundreds of years in perfect harmony  we have worked with the farmers as partners  now you want to blow it all to smithereens  of course i dont but  if i may my lord  mr crawley you are very new to our way of life here  i beg your pardon  theres no point biting jarviss head off you are new to it  must i remind you of the state the place was in a few months ago  that was nothing to do with the way we run it  the money was lost in a bad investment  and youve been bailing the place out with coras fortune you have been for years  downton must be selfsupporting if its to have a chance of survival  well youve given us plenty to think about hasnt he mr jarvis  he has indeed lord grantham  why would i persuade your father otherwise when i agree with him  how can you say that when you keep telling me to find something to do  i meant run a local charity  or paint watercolours or something  well im going to london to see the editor tomorrow  and if i like him then im going to say yes  i dont want to fall out with papa  but i dont want to be invisible either  ive had enough of it  very well im coming up tonight ill see what i can do  but i want a favour in return  ethel whats the matter  i had rather a nasty encounter in the village thats all  what sort of encounter mrs bakewell refused to serve me  in the end her husband did but it wasnt very nice  we shall take our business elsewhere  theres no need for that maam im used to it  you shouldnt have to be  are you all set for this evening  if you mean have i allowed ivy to go out when its not her half day  i have but why i could not tell you  bring them all home safe  if thats bechamel why dont you use parsley or mace  i do but i boil it in the milk beforehand  i made it last night oh leave her alone you big ninnie  theres nothing wrong with a man who can cook  some say the best cooks in the world are men  and do we think this sad beanpole will be the best cook in the world  why do you always feel the need to be so unpleasant james  whats alfred ever done to you  er you can take in the fish and meat tonight  james can follow with the sauce  but i should be the first footman of course you should  listen to her youre taller than him  youve been here longer than him  why are you taking her to the pictures when she talks like that  well ive got the tickets now so  dont get up  hows the christening going  its all arranged with the catholic church in ripon  werent you going to tell us  you and matthew  i didnt think the others would want to know  please give them a chance to behave properly  i wondered if youd be a godmother  am i allowed to be  as long as at least one of them is catholic  and my brothers coming over  hell stay in the village  no he wont hell stay here  hes a bit of a rough diamond  im very fond of diamonds  i still cant believe im here i keep pinching myself  believe  which one would be ours  well they wont move mr chirk or the tripps  but mrs bow wants to live in the village so we might get hers  none of which solves the problem of what im going to do  your job of course theyll have to give thomas his notice  mr barrow mr stickitupyourjumper  hell have to go  revenge is sweet  look at him he cant even balance it  oh leave him alone up you go  its a flipping insult just cos hes ten foot tall  youre right ive got a good mind to  dont do anything youll regret  these things can be managed but not by losing your temper  you make a cosy couple i must say  i dont think so its not what ive heard  alfred says hes always going on about you  silly sloppy stuff  alfreds sick and tired of it and no wonder  well hes making it up  have it you own way  right dont put them like that  theyve got to be able to get hold of them  thats why ive asked mr murray to come up  youve asked murray to come here without consulting me  i felt i wasnt explaining things well and i know he can  oh lovely what a treat  oh my your ladyship no no fuss no fuss  just scrape me down and get me a spare napkin  ill take that  i saw your cook in the village today isobel she seemed upset  yes mrs bakewell was rather unkind  it seems a pity that even in this pretty little village  people can be so unforgiving  some people are unforgiving others are insensitive  what time do you leave in the morning  i thought id get the ten oclock im meeting him for tea  youre not encouraging this  she hasnt agreed to anything yet  oh mama talk to her talk to all of them say something sensible  yes lets hear how a womans place is in the home  i do think a womans place is eventually in the home  but i see no harm in her having some fun before she gets there  oh granny thank you  have you changed your pills  and another thing i mean edith isnt getting any younger  perhaps she isnt cut out for domestic life  how are your plans proceeding tom  i was telling lady grantham  my brother has a garage in liverpool  hes asked me to go in with him the brother whos coming to stay  yes kieran why is he coming here  for the christening  how did he rearrange the spoons  right on the edge of my plate im not saying it was deliberate  i hope youre not cos i was trying to help  well i think alfred can manage without your help in future james  and next time will you wait to be asked before you take charge  are you still here  perhaps alfred no longer wants to go to the pictures  he may want to ponder his mistakes instead  of course theyre going are we  yes you can go i will not withdraw my permission  but as you walk you might contemplate what it is  to waste a chance when it is given  i suppose you never wasted a chance  well if i did i learnt from it and thats all i am asking from him  that and some ritual humiliation  you shouldnt have rung murray without telling papa  you berate me for not wanting to take responsibility  and now you tell me off for doing just that  you cant have it both ways  i can if i want to  whats the matter do you think i should see someone  what if theres anything wrong then its obviously my fault  you know what they told us when i was wounded  but they were wrong they said so  i wonder  darling please dont worry im sure theres nothing wrong  thats the point were not sure  it was ok but i prefer english films with english stars  they seem more real somehow  i like the american actors theyve got more youknowwhat  oh and how about ivy close in the worldlings  she makes lilian gish look like a village school maam  ivy close  its funny to think of a film star having your own name  there arent any with my name no but theres a king  the one who burnt the cakes  well i hope i wont be burning any of my cakes in future  where is everyone theyve gone to bed  except for the picturegoers theyre not back  if id thrown a bucket of slop in the old ladys lap  i wouldnt be allowed to go to the flicks  what are you saying mr carson doesnt like me  no matter what alfred does he still prefers him  its not bloody fair well i love you  well if you do youre on your own im sure im not  what about your family where are you from  i dont have any family not really cousins you know  noone else and your mum and dad  dead my dad was killed in the war  and my mother died of the flu  i havent any brothers and sisters so here we are  all on me ownsome  you must get lonely meaning  i know what its like thats all  funny were quite a pair  we both like to look very sure of ourselves  but were not so sure underneath are we  still youve no need to worry  mr carson may prefer alfred but nobody else does  dont they i wonder  sometimes i think its just jimmy contra mundi  is that latin i should try and tell mr carson  make up some points  never mind latin i need a magic spell  good night  hes a funny one isnt he  you cant pull the wool over my eyes  i know whats going on youre quite wrong miss obrien  hes a proper little ladies man  if thats how you want to play it  what are you going on about theres no need to bark  i only know what alfred tells me  well if he says jimmys interested in me hes lying  would he  is it supposed to be a secret  oh you are daft  oh ivy i love to be out with you like this  i wish we could make it a regular thing  i cant i wouldnt want you to get the wrong idea  look im sorry but jimmys just not interested  i hate to hurt your feelings like that but hes not  you dont know that he flirts with me he does  if you knew he wasnt interested would that make a difference  id have to hear it from his lips  sorry to wake you jimmy but  oh my get off just get the bloody hell off me  alfred its not what you think  dont do that please alfred doesnt matter  noone will believe a word he says hes nothing  what are you doing why are you in here  because of what you said because of all there is between us  theres nothing between us except my fist if you dont get out  and if you tell any  but what about the things you said  i said nothing except get out go on get out thomas  what is going on nothing mr carson  jimmy er james had a nightmare hes fine now  what is it whats going on  james whats the matter with you  nothing alfred  ask mr barrow its nothing really  it doesnt seem like nothing  ivy never mind the toast you look very tasty yourself this morning  what did you say cant a redblooded man compliment a pretty girl  not at breakfast for heavens sake  alfred whats happened not now  well if there is anything i ought to know  i hope i hear about it before the end of the day  this really has been so interesting  i hope this means youre persuadable lady edith  ill think about it i promise  i just felt i had to meet you and see what it would be like  i assume your father disapproves  well its the business of parents to worry isnt it  no all sorts of toffs are writing for magazines nowadays  some of them even advertise face creams cigarettes and the rest  im afraid papa would not find that reassuring  in fact if he were here hed probably just shout run  will you please make up your own mind without his advice  ill have to think about that too  are you going back to yorkshire tonight  no im staying with my aunt  ive got to look in to the offices of the lady while im here  not to write for them i trust  oh no its just something i promised to do for my grandmother  the lady thats covent garden heres an idea  lets er lets have lunch tomorrow at rules  if you accept the job well celebrate  if its a no ill drown my sorrows hows that  you seem nervous today barrow  we will get things sorted out we wont leave you in the lurch  id be grateful if you could let me know when youve made a decision  ill talk things through with carson  and well see what we can come up with  it makes no sense to retain this bit as a separate section  no sense at all  but of course jarvis wont see that because he hates change  just try to carry papa with you thats all i ask  hell be with me in the end because this is the only way forward  and at some point hes going to see that  some point in the near future i hope  whats the matter with you both you were in a dream all through dinner  nothings the matter  does mr murray want luncheon tomorrow  no hes in york all morning hell come up here afterwards  followed by toms brother for dinner  so it promises to be a day of contrast  god in heaven  what do you think tom i agree with matthew  the estate can offer proper compensation to the tenants now  while the moneys there but if we miss this chance  it may not come again so says the marxist  if you dont mind me saying so you have a narrow view of socialism  you seem to have a very broad interpretation of it  now now children  if branson is watering down his revolutionary fervour  let us give thanks tom  do you know anything about farming tom  a little my grandfather was a sheep farmer in ireland  why do you keep giving me funny looks im not  whats going on  have you both been up to something i dont know about  not both of us  are you awake  i cant seem to get to sleep i dont know why  could you credit matthew summoning murray without my permission  you keep telling everyone downtons a dual monarchy now  i never realised you didnt mean it  so youre against me over matthew the christening and edith  robert  even your mother spoke up for edith think of that  a facer i admit  shell have had some reason of her own of course  is she really so machiavellian  yes  i was afraid youd stood me up  im so sorry it took much longer than i thought  what was it about oh just family stuff  an errand for my grandmother  are you very family minded  well when you live at home with your parents youre still in the middle of all of it  i saw a picture in the paper of your elder sisters wedding she looked glamorous  people say so  am i allowed to say im rather pleased youre not married  im a little less pleased  oh dear it sounds like youre hiding a romantic secret  not too romantic  a little while ago i was jilted at the altar  which wasnt much fun oh dear i am sorry  oh please dont be  its a relief to be reminded im not an object of pity  to the entire world  ive clearly put my foot in it and now youll turn the job down  please dont i wont  not if you dont want me to  ah  surely lord grantham you dont question mr crawleys goal  of making the estate selfsufficient no  but i question his plans for the employees and tenants  in order to achieve it  cant we allow things to evolve more gently  as we did in the past the past is not much of a model  the third earl nearly went bankrupt  the fourth only saved the estate by dying  and what would you all have done in the 90s  without lady granthams money  i say murray when i asked you to say what you think  i didnt mean to be taken literally must we talk in this way  yes im afraid so  thanks to mr swire we have another chance  but we have to change our ways  all im talking about is investment increasing productivity  and reducing waste waste  yes the estate has been run very wastefully for many years  i wont listen to this now come on jarvis  if i can listen to it so can you no lord grantham i cant  am i to stand here after 40 years of loyal service  to be accused of malfeasance and corruption  nothing of the sort my dear chap think for a moment  we must both see things have to move forward  my goal is to find the way of least disruption  wont you stay and help me with that  my lord will you give me a good reference  yes of course i will  mr jarvis if i have offended you then i offer my sincerest apologies  i am the old broom mr crawley  you are the new  i wish you luck with your sweeping mlord  mr carson youd better come  may i help you this is mr bransons brother  can we fetch mr branson sir  ive already sent alfred here they are now  kieran what are you doing down here come upstairs  i dont fancy it can i not stay put and have my dinner down here  but were all so looking forward to meeting you mr branson  if you come with us you can see your room and get changed  if you want to and what would i change into a pumpkin  come on tommy come and eat down here  they seem like a nice lot whats the matter  are you too grand for them now  they know that im not  but my motherinlaw has been kind enough to invite you to stay and dine  and ill not let you snub her now get a move on  i know you always said he would bring shame on this house  no mrs hughes for once i will hold my tongue  i thought mr bransons respect for her ladyships invitation exemplary  well mr bransons done something right for a change  miracles can happen  how was it  pretty bad jarvis has resigned  what hes gone  and im going to have to make it all work or ive had it  come here  youll make me untidy  good  you see i know its right mary  i believe i can make downton safe for our children  if we ever have any  but i can only do it if youre with me  but what about papa i do love him  love him by all means  but believe in me  there will that convince you  convince me again  and dont say if we ever have any  because we will  but its been a while now  what if mr carson finds out you knew all along and you never told him  how will that look surely its for jimmy to tell  supposing hes in on it  no he started yelling at thomas as soon as i walked in  yes im sure he did as soon as you walked in  what if you hadnt walked in  im sorry alfred mr carson wont tolerate these sort of shenanigans  and hell be furious if he finds out you knew and said nothing  you need to speak up for your own good  and what exactly does this business consist of  automobile refurbishment  he means car repairs  i see and you would live nearby  weve rooms over the garage  theres a bit of a park not too far away  well thats something  i remember an evening rather like this  we were travelling back from scotland to london  when the train was suddenly engulfed by a blizzard  and we spent the night in a tradesmens hotel in middlesbrough  so whos coming to the christening all of us i expect  granny well yes if branson tom wants me to  i would be honoured robert are you coming  tom doesnt want me there and i wouldnt know what to do  all that crossing and bobbing up and down  i went to a mass once in rome it was more like a gymnastic display  i would like you to be there very much  why what difference would it make  all i know is sybil would want you there  she loved you with all her heart  and she would want you there  will you argue with that  not if you think its so important  how did you get on in london  well as a matter of fact  ive got an announcement to make  now is as good a time as any  listen everyone  you have a journalist in the family  since we have a country solicitor and a car mechanic  its only a matter of time  how was the editor in the end  oh nice very nice  so youre ready to speak out  i think youre right and i must  good he has broken all the fundamental laws of god and man  report him as you should and then stand back and enjoy his fall  i dont understand  youve placed an advertisement in a magazine  to find a job for my housekeeper i knew youd be against it  well how would you feel if i found other work for your cook or butler  granny feels that for ethels sake she should move elsewhere  oh nonsense she couldnt give tuppence about ethel  or anyone like her  youve been reading those communist newspapers again  i dont suppose theres any beer  havent you had enough of course we have beer  we must have some somewhere carson  i believe so mlady ill fetch it  whats the betting well have a chorus of molly malone  before we finish youre the one pushing tom into his brothers arms  this is not what sybil wanted for him she told me  oh carson would you ask mrs hughes to meet me in the hall please  very good mlady ill bring the beer in a moment sir  it isnt so bad here after all  i dont know she just asked if you could go up  i suppose ill have to  whats this they said we could go  theyll ring when they need the car  mr carson might i have a word well i have to take this up  oh very well then come with me  mrs hughes you have always taken an interest in ethel  do you think im wrong no  while ethel is in this village she is doomed to be lonely  but if as her ladyship suggests she can get a job far away from here  shes not a bad cook now and with a respectable reference  which of course you can give her  i cant get over how youve planned all this without a word to me  well i knew you wouldnt agree i know how you hate facing facts  i resent that im sorry but i do  mrs crawley i hope you dont see me as an intolerant person  no because i agree with her ladyship  in a new place where she can start again  ethel has far more chance of happiness  than in reenacting her own version of the scarlet letter in downton  what is the scarlet letter  a novel by nathaniel hawthorne  it sounds most unsuitable  ill talk to ethel  i dont understand what youre saying thomas was doing what  thats what i saw mr carson and what was james doing  i think he was asleep  because he just woke and he got very angry  as he should have been by god  my auntie says he might have been faking because i walked in  but it didnt look fake to me  well we can always rely on your aunt to take the ungenerous view  you will not speak of this to anyone is that clear  i dont want to hear the subject even mentioned  in the servants hall very good mr carson  the world can be a shocking place alfred  but you are a man now and you must learn to take it on the chin  beg pardon maam i was miles away thats all right  i just wanted to let you know that i was back  would you like some tea no thank you  im going straight to bed  ethel  are you happy  well i i suppose im happy compared to what i was before  you see i  never mind  good night  how can i still be here when all the young have gone to bed  the motors ready when you are when is jarvis leaving  im not sure  it seems a poor return for 40 years of service  maybe but he was your fathers man  to him you were always the young master never the chief  which does not alter the fact that now we must find someone else  but youve already found him what do you mean  well obviously the answer to a thousand different questions  is to give the position to branson  tom well if hes the agent  we can call him branson again thank heaven  thats a mad plan its not  tom and matthew can work on the new ideas together  theyre the same age but what does he know of farming  his grandfather was a farmer in a small way  which means he has more practical experience than jarvis ever had  think of the child  you cannot want your only granddaughter  to grow up in a garage with that drunken gorilla  dont we owe this to sybil  ill do it on one condition no two  first matthew must agree he will  second you will both admit it when you realise you were wrong  oh well that is an easy caveat to accept  because im never wrong  i dont need to tell you that this is a criminal offence  we hadnt done anything  but you were hoping to do something if alfred hadnt come in  its not against the law to hope dont you get clever with me  when you should be horsewhipped  do you have a defence  am i mistaken in any part of this  not really mr carson as for a defence what can i say  i was very drawn to him  and id got the impression that he felt the same way  i was wrong  it seems an odd mistake to make  when youre like me mr carson  you have to read the signs as best you can because no one dares speak out  i do not wish to take a tour of your revolting world  no  so are you saying  that james is the innocent party in all this  yes mr carson he is  i will take time to consider  we must first find out what james intends to do  hed be within his rights to report you to the police  although im quite sure it wont come to that  will you give me your word that nothing had happened  i will yes  right good night  mr barrow looks very grim faced  never mind him  human natures a funny business isnt it  now why didnt the poets come to you mr carson  theyd have saved themselves a lot of time and trouble  whats this i hope you dont mind  if you could all form a group around the father  kieran right mama do you want to go next to isobel  it seems so strange without sybil here  shes watching i know  i envy you i wish i did  ever so slightly thank you so much  you want me to take on the running of the estate its a big job  think of it as a christening present from sybil  its a wonderful idea tom im ashamed it wasnt mine  perhaps one with the grandfather holding the baby  and maybe the great grandmother with him  and what about father dominic who christened her  whats the matter robert  are you afraid youll be converted while youre not looking  im to leave with no reference after working here for ten years  are you sure about rose wouldnt it be better if she stayed here  no no no im quite looking forward to it  perhaps ill run away not this time  oh my g  i ought to report him to the police what  i never wanted to push it this far  i must hand in my resignation at once  robert the last time you made an investment you ruined the family
