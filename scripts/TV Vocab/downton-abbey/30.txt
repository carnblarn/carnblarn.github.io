                 shouldnt the hot toast come to me first daisy sorry mr carson  why is alfred getting special treatment im sure hes not  why is he getting special treatment  why do you think because hes staying here with us  oh this is nice  mr napier and mr blake are coming up in a few days  he asks if im serious about their staying here  and are you  certainly they could be useful  theyre writing a report on why estates like this are going wrong  but you dont think downtons going wrong do you my lady no  but i wouldnt mind having it confirmed  you seem brighter lately  have things sorted themselves out  not quite but  its better  yes  and youve moved back into the cottage  i have my lady  well youre obviously not going to tell me what it was about  but im glad if its resolved  nothing for me  afraid not  this is a fine kettle of fish i must say  your uncle harold is in a proper fix  why whats he done this time something to do with oil leases  whos uncle harold coras brother  i always think him rather good at business if nothing else  but it seems hes backed a very lame horse this time  why is he bothering you with it im not entirely sure whats that  its about the tamworths we had tamworths at duneagle daddy swears by them  its a new thing for us we havent done much with pigs before  i thought you were convincedi am but im allowed to be nervous  intensive farmings a big step  half past eight i must skedaddle  penny for your thoughts  youd pay twice that not to know them  if there was anything i could do i know  its not your fault its mine  your husband is a brooder  and brooders brood then brood about me  im making anchovy sauce for the fish souffle  do you want to watch no youre all right  his hearts not in it any more  oh i think it is but when you fall off a horse you need a bit of time to get back in the saddle  cousin cora i think you can call me cora now  i wouldnt dare with cousin robert you must dare with me how can i help  ii wanted to tell you that ive settled the surprise for his birthday  since you wont tell me what it is i dont know what to say good  well the thing is  i need carson to keep the secret do you think he will  its only on the day and its only till after dinner  mrs hughes is the one for a secret  yes thats true  and itll be she who has to deal with it  the second post your ladyship  thank you spratt you havent taken the netsuke carving from here  you know the one i mean the little ivory fisherman  i know it but ive not touched it  not to wash it or mend it or something  no and who else has been in this room in the last day or so  the maids of course and young pegg  he was watering the pot plants  but betty was with him watching all the time well no  she was cleaning but i wouldnt want her blamed  oh i wouldnt blame her  you know of course the netsuke is very valuable  thats the risk with little things  they fit into a pocket easily  i have a feeling most things would fit into this particular pocket  thank you spratt my lady  we have to get the sums right we must speculate to accumulate  so speaks the american half of you  will you really go to america dont worry i wont go until the pig business is up and running  we can give you masses of introductions  grandmamma and uncle harold for a start  lord grantham got a letter from him today  it wasnt good news  i shouldnt worry it only means a yachts gone aground  or a girls gone back to mother thats not what it sounded like  right ill get the car  anything to report  its nothing im sure  but lady rose seems to have some secret she wants mrs hughes to keep  thats more like it  what secret  i dont know itll be nothing  now must take this up  you were dismissed from one minute to the next  mr maley came over said i wasnt needed no more and that was that  its disgraceful  is there nothing you can do about it  no but i dont understand it  i had a good touch with the greenhouses  i did all the house plants i was working well i know i was  im sure ill see if i can get to the bottom of it  im very grateful your ladyship im not your la oh never mind  a band shh  noone must know  well get the carpets rolled up and everything set during dinner  so that when his lordship walks out of the dining room there it is  and were to hide them until then  hide them  you just have to keep them with you his lordship wont come down here  so i have to find them food and beds how many are there  six i think but ill check  and her ladyship knows about it  well not that its a band because its a surprise for her too  but she knows that there is a surprise and that youre helping me with it  very well ill see what i can do  thank you  i wondered why lady rose was down here  and im afraid you will continue to wonder  thats very mysterious mrs hughes  you know me mr barrow a woman of mystery if ever there was one  well her secret wont affect us  how can you be so sure  now you have got me worried  i am sorry to hear that mr barrow  but now you must let me get on  all i know is this  i find pegg in this room and my paper knife is gone  he comes into the room again and a very valuable piece of japanese netsuke is missing  things things things  i dont understand your position  are you saying hes justified in stealing my possessions  or do you not believe he took them  im saying you put too much importance on material objects  and not enough on justice oh really  i wonder you dont just set fire to the abbey and dance round it  painted with woad and howling  i might if it would do any good  ah well   i beg your pardon your ladyship no dont apologise  im glad to have an ally in the room  this was found in bettys cleaning bucket  it mustve rolled in there and shes just found it  oh  thank you thank you  im very relieved  relieved or irritated  if that will be all my lady  arent you going to say youre sorry certainly not  he may not have taken this  or he may have sneaked it into the maids bucket when we werent looking  how you hate to be wrong  i wouldnt know im not familiar with the sensation  so youre determined to dig in your heelsi am sorry  but whether or not he took this he certainly took the knife  that is all i have to say on the subject  edith  whatevers the matter  michaels vanished into thin air  nobodys heard from him noone can reach him  im sure its just a failure of communication  if anything had happened wedve heard  maybe  i just wish to god hed pick up the telephone  he will  come on  we ought to get changed  last post one for me and er one for you alfred  ive got it its from the ritz  one of the chosen candidates has dropped out of the course and i was next  i was fifth see jimmy i was the fifth  i never said you werent so they want you do they  yes ill

congratulate him daisy  daisy run and put the kettle on  you can leave that there  if you need anything washing give it to me tonight  and me well get you shipshape  im quite nervous now whats there to be nervous about  youre nervous because youre intelligent alfred  only stupid people are foolhardy  im ever so sorry daisy are you when youre the one thats driven him away  how do you make that out  because you wanted jimmy and not him and thats why he were forced to go  he knew that come on girls  dry your tears and lets get on with the dinner  ivy come and beat these eggs  youre back i thought you mustve missed the last train  no but i only just caught it  do you want some dinner i ate in the restaurant car  you werent very long in london  there wasnt much to do just sign some papers for a trust billy sheffield set up for his son  what will that entail mainly telling the boy to drink less and be nicer to his mother  we learned at dinner that alfreds leaving  hes got a place on the ritz cookery course after all ah  im sorry to cut and run my lord  dont worry about it were proud of you  you must return one day as a famous chef  my lord theres something i wanted to say  ive been well treated in this house and i want you all to know that im very grateful  thank you alfred  mr carson has been a kind  and wonderful teacher  much more and we shall all burst into tears  im sorry my lord come along alfred lets get back to work  hows my birthday dinner coming on  how do you know about the dinner  the coldhursts rang yesterday and said theyd love to come  werent we all sworn to secrecy god people are so hopeless  i dont mind it wont spoil it if its not a surprise not for me  there may still be a surprise so i should hope  so what about tomorrow i know youd enjoy it what are you going to see  the sheikh ooh  i like that rudolph valentino  ooh he makes me shiver all over  what a very disturbing thought  lets us go for a date we could leave when weve dressed them  and be back in time to put them to bed  lady mary wouldnt mind  why not its been a long time since we went out to dine  too long i quite agree  will you send a message to mr molesley in the morning  why should i because alfreds going  so wont you need him now  ill need a new footman yes but mr molesley has  as the saying goes had his chance and missed it  you dont mean that not when he agreed to come last time  yes he agreed much as kaiser bill agreed to abdicate  with the greatest possible reluctance  but surely  im sorry mrs hughes  young alfred gave thanks tonight  for the courtesy and kindness he has received here both from the family and from me  and that is what i like to see gratitude  i dont want someone who has to be dragged into the house by his heels  yes but mr molesley has had a lot  a lot to put up with  weve all had a lot to put up with mrs patmore  and it is not made easier by working with people who dont want to be here  it may be worse than you think they may be getting ready to lay some people off  why would that concern lady rose  not sure  but mrs hughes seems to think we could all be affected  youve got to find out more  but how youll think of something  ill arrange something tomorrow book somewhere special  if you like  i know it cant be the same as it used to be  i dont deceive myself about that  but i want to make some new memories  good memories  so its not as if all our happiness was before  im happy whenever i look at you  but youre not are you  everything is shadowed  every moment we share is shadowed  youre right  lets have one evening  when we dont think about it  we leave it all behind  thank you  tonight ill change before the gong  i have a committee meeting and then were all dining together in some frightful hotel  i should leave around six what will you wear my lady  well i dont want to insult them  i should look as if ive tried elegant but sensible i know  ill let you choose thank you  dont forget to write and good luck  i know youll get what you want do you cos i dont always  just remember youre as good as any frenchman i dont care what they say  ah youre off well all the luck in the world  dont do anything i wouldnt

someone very happy one day but it were never gonna be me  good luck i mean it  you work hard and you know what you want  i hope you do well alfred i think you will  alfred come along weve not a minute to lose  thank you daisy that means a lot to me  an awful lot  ah thank you mr carson  good morning maam  im afraid you just missed her ladyship shell be gone some time  what a shame thank you  ooh er oh my goodness  i feel a bit dizzy  might i sit down for a moment of course maam please come in  may i fetch you a glass of water no thank you spratt i just  need to sit quietly for a few minutes  certainly maam please ring if you need anything  eureka  youve been kind but im feeling much better  so ill be on my way  oh  would you give this to lady grantham  on her return  i found it down the side of the chair i was sitting in  she will be pleased she was very upset at its loss  i hope shell be pleased  im not certain that she will  but i hope so  mr molesley  what can i do for you  i was at the station this morning  were were renewing the gravel out front  and erm i ran into young alfred  hes off on his way to london yes  so er as he is going after all i thought  ill look in to confirm my willingness to return to downton  mr molesley im glad you are as you put it willing  but i cannot feel the word expresses the kind of  enthusiasm i am looking for in a new footman  what when we last discussed it  you made it quite clear that you didnt wish to plunge down the ladder of preferment  i was willing to  as you keep saying but i dont want to humiliate you  you feel youre meant for better things  and i wont contradict you  unfortunately we have no higher place to offer  in this house i know but i said  and you have your pride and i respect you for it  good day mr molesley  mrs crawley and dr clarkson your ladyship  oh to what do i owe this treat  lady grantham youve already changed for dinner  well erm well come back tomorrow  no my curiosity would not brook such a delay  did spratt give you the paper knife  yes then its quite clear that pegg did not steal it  or are you going to argue now that he sneaked it back in here when he realised what trouble he was in  well  its a thought  but a despicable one  what can i say to persuade you out of your injustice and stubbornness  cant you see the damage you do now  hold your horses mrs crawley  lady grantham has a right of reply  oh thank you dr clarkson now if you will put up your cudgels for a moment  oh spratt has the young gardener pegg brought in the vegetables yet  what hes in the kitchen now my lady  please ask him to step in here into the drawing room your ladyship  well ask him to remove his boots if that will soothe your nerves  i dont understand no if you wish to understand things  you must come out from behind your prejudice and listen  your ladyship yes could you give an account to mrs crawley  of what transpired between us this afternoon  im sorry my lady  tell her what i said to you  her ladyship sent for me so i came  she said shed been mistaken in saying that i were a thief  which she knew now to be untrue she gave me my job back  said she was sorry and asked if i could forgive her  which you have i certainly have doctor  thank you you may go  out come on  well  well id say that was game set and match to lady grantham  youre dining at the netherby  i know its quite something isnt it my lady  i dont think weve eaten in a hotel since before we were married  you dont mind do you  not at all and dont rush back  it wont kill me to get myself to bed  ill be back dont you worry  did i tell you that mr napier and mr blake will be here in time for dinner  on his lordships birthday  rather a baptism of fire  how long are they going to stay  im not sure  its openended  which granny would never approve of  bates  i dont seem to have it  could you look again because we definitely made a reservation  maybe you each thought the other had done it  i made the booking im afraid were very full tonight  the countess of grantham has a large party with her  lady granthams here among our patrons  are some of the greatest names in yorkshire society  and the countess is among them yes we know her  huh oh  these people claim to know you your ladyship  well we didnt i know them both very well indeed  youre dining here anna we were but there seems to be a mixup with the table  well im sure it can be sorted out  in a jiffy my lady in a jiffy  if you would like to wait one moment  that seems to have made a difference thank god hes a snob  my lady i promise you  im sure not but dont lets spoil the effect now  to be honest i wish i could join you  but id better get back  well if youd like to follow me  and er please excuse the little hiccup earlier  it will be the last  ah yes  i do apologise my lady but this came in the evening post  and it appears to have been overlooked  not to worry  is anything the matter  no not at all  why mr molesley how can we help you  i was wondering  if by any chance er mr carson had changed his mind  im afraid not  idve thought hed value my caution  my wanting to  weigh up the pros and cons before rushing in  so is this it then  do i just go back to mending the roads  oh dont give up so easily  now let me get some more hot water  look theres a seat over there  lets sit down were not in a hurry  if you say so  such a lovely night  look at that moon its as bright as a light bulb  so what do you make of this valentino chappy then  is he your type he is not i think hes slithery  if i were agnes idve gone straight back to london as quick as i could find a boat  so you dont like romance  well i wouldnt say that  get off will you get off me  ive been good to you ivy  ive taken you to the theatre and to the cinema ive never been that nice to any girl before  am i supposed to feel lucky its dishonest to take from a bloke without giving him in return  i dont think its playing the game  well im not playing your game  and youd better get used to that idea  heres to us  sorry  i was a fool to think we could leave it behind  dont be sorry im sorry  but you see every time i remember what youve been through  i want to murder  but im not a victim  thats not who i am  the worst part is you see me as a victim  no my darling i see you as a woman i shouldve protected  im the failure here not you  can i interrupt  i wondered if you want a lift home starks here  that seems such an imposition  not at all and it should mean you get a table here for the rest of your life  can we have our coats please the three of us  it would be my pleasure  this is very kind my lady have you had a good evening  yes yes very good thank you  well dont sound so hesitant or the maitre d will kill himself  no weve had a lovely time  he didnt hurt you no  but he asked for things no man should want before theyre married  yes i think were a bit more clear about that than they are  i suppose hes been sweettalking me so he could have his way  i thought he was so nice how many women have said that since the norman conquest  alfred would never have done such a thing he had too much respect  dont start what do you mean  you break alfreds heart so now hes alone in a city that terrifies him  you break my heart by driving him away  i dont care about your good opinion of alfred  if youd discovered it earlier youdve spared us a lot of grief  what was all that about  oh id say it was about the fact that youve had it coming  it was nice of you to give them a lift i was glad to  but  i may be mistaken but im afraid things have gone wrong between those two  thats sad to hear its not just a case of a marriage gone sour  annas been hurt somehow and bates feels he shouldve protected her  i dont want any of that to leave this room baxter  course not my lady  edith my most darling girl whats the matter  but im not your most darling girl am i  i love my children equally  i dont know why people say that when its almost never true  look if this is about michael gregson do you want me to get involved send someone over  no  his office has already done that  theres a detective in munich now working with the german police  then you just have to be patient  i want to know whats happened  if hes trapped somewhere or  falsely imprisoned  or even dead  i mean it  if the worsts happened i want to know  its just so impossible to plan in this fog  well im sure hes not dead  no you arent  because none of us can be  but how was she hurt  what happened to her  im just telling you what her ladyship told lady mary  i dont know anything else then keep your ears open  i always do  whats the matter  i dont really like telling tales  you knew the conditions when you came here  i did so whats changed  shes polite shes  considerate i dont feel shes deserved it  now listen  what you have to decide is where your first loyalties are  with her or with me  all right  have it your own way oh i intend to  thank you  its so kind of you all to have us  isnt it charles it is  were anxious to do our bit  what do you mean by that  well youre here to advise the landowners on how to get through this crisis arent you  to save the estates that need saving  im afraid evelyn may have given you the wrong impression  in what way the government is aware  that great estates are being sold in large numbers  precisely north yorkshire has a lot of these estates big and small  and many are in difficulty we will have every variety of problem to study  and youre here to help not quite  were here to analyse the situation and ask whether our society is shifting fundamentally  will it affect food production and so on  so you dont care about the owners just about food supply  if thats how you want to put it  and doesnt that seem meanspirited  mr lloyd george is more concerned with feeding the population than rescuing the aristocracy  i dont find that meanspirited you may find us disappointing guests  if you want us to stay up till two in the morning being witty  dont worry i dont expect mr blake to be witty  how long will you be here until the job is done and we can write a report  if youll have us you must be sure to get rid of us when we become a nuisance  the gong is rung at seven and we meet in the drawing room at eight  you know its roberts birthday  so you must try to be witty tonight mr blake  after that well lower our expectations  the girls will show you up  hello mr molesley theres a chair here no im not here to eat  why have you come then mrs hughes sent for me  she said you had a big party tonight and itd be useful to mrs patmore if i serve the servants tea  what mrs patmore has a lot to do  mr molesley said he would help  to serve the servants tea  hes not proud mr carson  he wants to be useful where he can be  oh all right i give in  i cannot fight a war on every front  mr carson look out a livery  you can start tonight move in tomorrow  thank you mr carson very much  and dont forget the gloves  lady rose can i help oh please dont let me disturb you  but i wanted to make a speech  mrs hughes may have told you   i havent yet well we should tell them now  as a treat for his lordship  a london band is coming to play after dinner  a london band thats the berries  from a nightclub called the lotus  a nightclub my lady really  but it must be a complete surprise  noone knows anything and they mustnt that is  her ladyship knows somethings going to happen but even she doesnt know what  and you think shell be pleased shell be thrilled  well look after your secret so until then if you can just make them comfortable  i know musicians are outside your daily round  dont worry about that my lady we can take it in our stride  we may be yorkshiremen but we do know a little of life in the city  hello uh is anyone there  i think this is where were supposed to be  welcome to downton  i thought id come up early  and spend some time with george  i told nanny id feed him but now you can do it  hed like that oh i doubt it  he probably thinks whos this funny old lady but never mind  by the way i thought id be grandmamma  and then cora can be granny  and what about sybbie what should she call you  well aunt isobel i think im not quite a real aunt but i nearly am  did i read that your friend lord gillingham is engaged  yes to miss lane fox  i hope you dont mind i should so hate for you to be unhappy  im not unhappy  im just not quite ready to be happy  when i got engaged i was so in love with reginald i felt sick  i was sick with love  literally  it seems so odd to think about it now it really does  it was the same for me  as if id gone mad or been hypnotised or something for days  weeks  all i could think about was her  and me  i was standing outside in the snow  and i didnt have a coat  but i wasnt cold because all i kept thinking was  hes going to propose hes going to propose  well  arent we the lucky ones  oh look whos here  hello sybbie hello  have you never thought of visiting africa  and why should i go to africa mr carson  im no more african than you are  well not much more  my people came over in the 1790s we wont go into why or how  oh no better left unsaid mr ross  youve uncovered something about the past that mr carson doesnt approve of well done  not so fast mrs hughes we led the world in the fight against slavery  remember lord henleys judgment of 1763  if a man sets foot on english soil  then he is free dont undo mr rosss good work  ivy when i said that i could   oh goodness is that the time  im first down i just want to check everythings on track  i gave them something to eat as theyll be playing during the servants dinner  yes that was very kind wait until carson has  everyone in their seat before you start setting up  i will  well shes quite a character  lady rose  thats one word for her  but i cant help feeling sorry for the poor pigs  do you eat bacon  yes  sausages yes  then you are a sentimentalist who cannot face the truth  im not often called sentimental  your friend seems to be putting mary through her paces  im afraid charles will take on anyone with a sense of entitlement  you mean mary feels entitled to take charge shes welcome to take charge of me  molesley glad to be back  surprised more like my lady  but i suppose ill be called joseph now  ii dont think i can manage that nor can i  carson you dont mind if we go on calling molesley molesley do you of course not my lord  why do you want to emigrate  because i realised id never fit in at downton  theyre very fond of you here i think they are  and im fond of them i love them really  though it surprises me to say it  but im not one of them  and i cannot make a life here  why not  would there be another earls daughter whod be keen to take me on do you think  oh i dont know  it would depend on her  no she wouldnt  there arent many as free as my sybil  well i agree with that  so should i bring a nice irish working girl to live here  would that make everyone comfy  isobel really appears to be coming out of the mist  im so pleased well dont be too pleased  part of her recovery is going back into battle  if shes fighting for her causes again that seems a good sign  a sign of what  that we should close the shutters and bar the door  she likes to fight for what she believes in  oh no its not a matter of what she likes it is her fuel  some people run on greed  lust even love  she runs on indignation  im catching the ladies eye  oh no rose  no were not splitting tonight  were all going out together  what on earth is she talking about what  quick  play and a one two three  happy birthday cousin robert  i say    im just wild about harry      and harrys wild about me      the heavenly blisses of his kisses      fill me with ecstasy      hes sweet just like chocolate candy      and just like honey from bees    who is this singer and how did he get here  isnt it rather odd  no i think its fun    hes just wild about me    but granny is it really suitable that rose has brought this man here  oh my dear we countrydwellers must beware of being provincial  try and let your time in london rub off on you a little hm  id love to know which estates youre going to examine  im sure you would  you mustnt be too discreet  after a while it gets a little dull  you seem to have brought a traitor into our midst  not a traitor an enemy then  hes obviously not on our side  it is a bit wild jazz at downton abbey  i think its lovely  you see tom  things can happen at downton  that noone imagined even a few years ago  take heart from that  before you throw in the towel  is this your first experience of jazz lady grantham  oh is that what it is  do you think any of them know what the others are playing  hm    hes just wild about me    did you ask me to come down i did  weve made some sandwiches for you and the others  as i doubt youll be off duty before midnight  well set a little table inside the green baize door they sound good from down here  if you like that sort of thing i thought mr ross was very nice  so did i strange to relate  though its still an odd sort of thing to be happening at downton  makes you want to jig about dunt it certainly not  i think i think weve done enough now  you know  to show that were good sports of course of course  i do think it was a brilliant idea  but it must be costing rose a fortune  shall we chip in  or pay it get the bandleader to send me the bill  ill go down at the end of the night and catch him before he leaves  im afraid i dont share your enthusiasm for her  why not shes the type who demands all this as a right  but she wants it on a plate  she won work for it and she wont fight for it  and that type doesnt deserve to survive  i dont want to make trouble  but she feels much the same about you  oh edith  i wish youd tell me whats wrong  how do you know somethings wrong  because im your mother is it michael is there any news  not really  he went to munich a few weeks ago thats all they know  well of course youre worried  well its not often that a birthday surprise really is a surprise  i just hope we havent shocked the servants too much  carson was ready to faint  although amazingly he told me that the bandleader  was a very decent fellow my lord  so perhaps well make a modern of him after alli doubt it  oh and theres no news on mr gregson hes still missing  edith told me  but im sure hell be fine  by the way did you ever read that letter from harold i did  and ive had one from mother i didnt wanna bother you  but i think hes in a deep hole  have you ever met this senator fall not that i remember  i suppose he may be innocent nothings been proved  the one thing that has been proved is that harold was a fool to get involved  dont get riled about it now  come to bed and dream of ragtime  is anyone still awake  mary  what are you doing down here  i was looking for mr ross  mr ross i wanted to thank you for a marvellous evening  and also to ask you if you would be kind enough to send the bill to his lordship  but thats not necessary he wants to  he says your present was arranging the whole thing  of course  and now its my turn to thank you  ive been so well looked after here  im glad to hear it  well goodnight  his lordship is going to america  robert must be there why my being there wont make any difference  im feeling rather ill i wanted him away before i keel over  how can two brainless dullards like us ever hope to entertain mr blake  mary that sounded a little rude  how long have you been like this  i really dont feel well at all  darling please tell me whats the matter youve seemed so preoccupied lately  i think this is the right place well it is mr gillingham  i suppose you could to shake us up again
