                 oh mr barrow youre back  im afraid youve missed luncheon but youre in time to help upstairs  maybe theres something left dont bother im not hungry  charming as ever hows your father doing  oh much better as it happens in fact hes quite well again  thats good news yes it is  you remember were meeting mr wavell at three pips corner  yes but i dont see the point in it since im not going to agree  hes driven all the way from leeds  i had a letter from your father he says hes in london for a visit  shrimpies in england have you made any plans to see him  not yet he wonders if you might let him stay here  of course whenever he wants  is susan with him no  their times up soon and she couldnt face another voyage  where will they send him do you think after bombay  how are your russians getting on  oh its so sad  they talk about the old days  dances at the winter palace picnics on the banks of the neva   but there are holes in their shoes and theyve got no money for food  this is where tom says it serves them right  well i dont approve of how things were managed in russia  but im still sorry for people who have to make a new life in a foreign land  honestly papa every time you challenge tom you sound much more unreasonable than he is  do i  hows your old beau managing mama prince thingummyjig  he is not my old beau  your father would have called out any man who said such a thing  even so i do hope you see him again poor old boy  you dont know anything about it  how far would the houses stretch  well the whole field really  but why cant they be built in a row like the other streets  theyd sell more quickly as separate dwellings and wed get a percentage of the sales  so were paid once and in return the field is lost  the village is spoiled and mr wavell moves on in search of his next victim  why didnt you tell them we were coming here today  oh theyll find out as soon as rose gets home  i didnt want to be a topic for the rest of luncheon  but what are we here for  well somethings been troubling me  oh why on earth didnt we get a taxi from the station  we must be mad  well well get a taxi home  thats for sure  its saying its in the crypt  oh isobel i didnt think it would be like this  no neither did i  aunt violet mrs crawley you never said you were coming  we wanted to surprise you  well youve succeeded  ah there he is  i must be the last person you expected to see  no i thought you would come  ive brought my cousin mrs crawley  do you remember rostov  count rostov i think  thank you yes please ladies please  im sorry i didnt say very much  thank you at downton  but i was i was so surprised  you havent changed i have  its true  then you were the young and beautiful countess of grantham  turning eyes in a ballroom or out in your carriage  now you are the great lady  imperious magnificent  but these are two sides of the same coin  your life has not much altered in half a century  it doesnt seem so to me  whereas the handsome and powerful prince kuragin  with his thousands of acres and his golden palaces  that man does not exist not any more  ah mr molesley ive put out some silver to be cleaned  id be grateful if you could see to it  very good mr carson i was looking for mr barrow  hes gone out precisely  but then i thought no this is down to mr molesley  after all he is the first footman  oh  i have thought a good deal about what you said the other day  when i asked after the princess  that i dont know how or where she is  its true  we were arrested together  and when i came out of prison i heard shed been exiled a year earlier  there must be someone in authority who  who  the soviet ambassador  do you think he cares where princess irina kuragin is presently lodged  well what about the foreign office  do they help the losing side in any revolution no  you mustnt give up hope  when you go through a storm like ours  you give up hope quite early on in the proceedings  i agree hope is a tease designed to prevent us accepting reality  oh you only say that to sound clever  i know  you should try it  i want to call on the blacksmith ill see you back at the house  mrs patmore  oh good afternoon mlord mlady  i wish i knew what that was about  and why the funny look when i asked after shrimpie at luncheon  i suspect hes come to tell rose theyre getting a divorce  are you serious im afraid so  hes hinted at it in his letters apparently  and i gather things have not been improving  thats the end of his career  well the martboroughs have survived divorce  well the martboroughs are very rich shrimpie hasnt got a bean  people will drop them like hot potatoes  will we drop shrimpie susans your cousin not him  no i wont take sides whatever susan wants  would you give me a hand with these  when are you leaving lady mary wants to get the eight oclock  shes going to a dress show with lady rosamund in the afternoon  ill miss you so i should hope  are you all right i hope you havent let the sergeant worry you  no he doesnt worry me  i just wish we could all forget about mr green  why did you want me to go with you today  oh it was just in case things turned mawkish  i prevent lord merton saying anything to embarrass you   i wanted the same protection myself  i presume you and prince kuragin were once attracted to each other  attracted to each other is that what you call it  as it happens he asked me to run away with him  but you didnt go no lord grantham gave me a frame by faberge  with two pictures of the children in it and i saw sense  lord grantham sounds rather more subtle than id realised  well like all englishmen of his type  he hid his qualities beneath a thick blanket of convention  so i didnt see who he really was at first  it was lucky you found out in time  if it was in time  i forget  daisy will you put those bally books away and come and help  and where are the pastry casings  ill make them now you should have made them before  what is all that im studying the glorious revolution of 1688  well therell be a glorious revolution down here if you dont watch it  did you hear that in there  i mean mathematics is one thing shes studying to be a revolutionary now  i hope theres no cooking going on up in your room  i should find out what hes up to im sure its nothing  lord merton  oh i er well that is  youre here  well hadnt you better come in thank you  well how can i help  i nearly flunked it  but ive put it off so many times  and as i was sitting all alone at luncheon today i just thought  no im jolly well going over there to say it  i do hope this wont be something youll regret  you may regret it i wont  very well im listening  i really should go down on one knee but i fear id never get up again  im sure you realise by now  im asking for your hand in marriage  dear lord merton you see   please please  i want to be quite dear  im not speaking out of loneliness or with a view to my comfort  im sure  no youre not  when men of my age marry thats usually the reason  but my proposal is a romantic one  i state freely and proudly isobel that i have fallen in love with you  and i want to spend what remains of my life in your company  i believe i could make you happy  at any rate i i should very much like the chance to try  well goodness lord merton  i freely admit you have taken me by surprise  not with your proposal but with your talk of love  i mean it  and before you refuse me  id like to ask you to leave it on the table so to speak  say nothing for the time being  just think about it  im not sure it would change my answer  but after such eloquence  to refuse your request would seem ungenerous  i will think about it  well  now i think ill take my leave  i suspect ordinary conversation would be difficult after that  what do you mean that man bricker is coming back why  that man bricker what has he done to deserve such a welcome  hasnt he seen what he came to see  he wants to investigate a possible link between our picture and a later work by della francesca  shrimpie is coming this week  well then he and mr bricker will get to know each other wont they  edith darling why so glum  im not glum am i  hows your prodigy child  i havent seen her for a while  i was getting rather under their feet so i thought id give them a rest  i knew that would happen  why dont you leave it for a few months  a few months i should  then theyll be pleased to see you when you do go back  any thoughts on pips corner  id love to understand the merits of the argument  you want us to do it dont you  well its capital with no outlay we have to consider it  consider it yes but its complex  do we really want to start breaking bits off the estate and selling them piecemeal  you wanted to sell land when matthew died  and i was wrong i didnt see how many owners would chip away at their land  until there was nothing viable left  anyway we can talk about it tomorrow  not me im going up to london first thing  aunt rosamunds taking me to a dress show  its good to know youve got your priorities straight  hello whos in there  please let me know whos in there  go away  mr barrow  would you like me to fetch a man to help you  mr barrow  what man  there isnt a man in this house whod help me  whats the matter with you  just mind your own business  now youre sure theres no big evening event  no and were only there one night  when are you seeing his lordship friday morning  before we catch the train home  its right to do it face to face  but of course im dreading it  daddy hello sybbie my love kiss  thank you nanny morning george  morning donk  morning sybbie morning george  do we think lady mary made the train she was cutting it fine  mr stark saw them both on board  carson may i ask you something  is mrs patmore quite happy  im afraid there is a particular matter that has upset her mlord  may i know what it is  but why make him wait  you mean i must refuse him now  well you said yourself the whole idea was ridiculous  yes but i can only tell you when it came to it he was not ridiculous  you surprise me  one kind word and your judgment takes flight  surely prince kuragin has reminded you what one kind word can do  hes asked me to think about it  and i will think about it  it was michaels office on the telephone  theres been a development  apparently theres a trial going on in munich  of the leader of a group of thugs there  ive read about this they wear brown shirts and go around bullying people  the leader tried to start a revolution  thats it it was absurd  maybe but im afraid were going to see a lot more of this sort of thing  we pushed germany too hard with our demands after the war  it seems it was this gang that got into a fight with michael  i can easily believe it theyre a horrid bunch from the sound of it  yes but we might be dose to finding out what happened to him  thats why his office telephoned  it will be very hard for you my darling  but i promise its better to know the truth  than to live in a cloud of mystery and despair  but as long as i dont know for sure then in a way im keeping him alive  i hate to let go of that  can you keep this to yourself papa  until were told for certain  i dont want to put up with marys pity any longer than i have to  she will pity you and god knows so do i  im fearfully late  where are my gloves dont worry  it will all be unpacked before you get back  youre a dream i must run  oh wait a minute could you post this  or give it to mead if he hasnt emptied the box in the hall  i never said where to meet me and kensington gardens would be nice and neutral  i thought about dining with him tonight  but midday seemed more appropriate for bad news  very good mlady  and how is edith getting on  actually shes rather gloomy at the moment do we know why  shes taken an interest in a child of one of the tenants  and now the parents are sick of her  and why this child in particular  i dont know she took a fancy to it  now she seems to have overplayed her hand  golly thatd be useful  so tell me more about this farmer and his little girl  how did you know it was a girl well you must have said  he looks after the pigs  oh yummy  good heavens theres charles blake  whats he doing here  excuse me is this right for lord gillingham  that doorway first floor  thank you  hello  nice to see you are you shopping for your trousseau  haha  oh i think you know lady mary crawley miss lane fox  oops  ive suddenly remembered the significance  try not to be an ass charles  well we dont know each other exactly  but we certainly know of each other dont we  its not often you meet the woman you were jilted for well i   dont worry i wouldnt want a man who preferred someone else  youre quite over him then absolutely  now i must go im meeting ralph kerr later  hes very tetchy if hes kept waiting  i thought you knew each other no  and i must say she wasnt at all what i imagined  what was that  i dont know someone meeker and more virtuous  i dont think mabels very meek no obviously not  how long are you in london i go home tomorrow  ill see tony in the morning and then catch the train  why what are you doing tonight nothing  then why not have dinner with me dont you have plans  none that i want to honour ill come for you at eight  nowhere too swanky i havent brought the right clothes  ill do them mrs patmore his lordship is asking for you  come up to the library please  oh my heaven what now oh lord  you look fine give me your apron  ah mr molesley just the man can you cast your eye over the dining table  i wont have time before dinner and youre the first footman  i was just going to  while youre up there  check the bedrooms for lord flintshire and mr bricker  i havent got a moment and as mr carson says you are the first footman  right im ready  go on then mr molesley it doesnt seem quite fair  you wanted to be first footman what did you think  that youd spend all day with your feet up  i thought id pop in and see how marigolds getting on  im afraid im just taking her up for a rest mlady  theyve been playing outside and shes tired  does she have to go up right away i think so yes mlady  mlady  the the trouble is margie thinks youre unsettling the child  there are laws that govern the whole business of war memorials  so mr carsons told me mlord  i appreciate how distressing this is for you and your family  do you mlord  because im not sure mr carson does  carson is as sorry about it as i am arent you carson  im sorry that mrs patmore should be distressed mlord  but youre not sorry archies names to be left off the memorial  he volunteered he didnt wait to be called up  he went to the front to fight and as for his socalled cowardice  that were like a wound in battle a wound to his brain  so he didnt know what he was doing  he were a good and decent lad  of course he was but doesnt that make him a casualty of war mlord  same as our william or any of them  he could have stayed here safe and well until they came for him  but instead he chose to fight for his country  it may surprise you to learn mrs patmore but i agree with you  even though i can do nothing about it  its not helpful but i do  no it is helpful  it helps to think that decent folk can see our archie was a victim  even if mr carson cant  thank you carson  when does shrimpie get here and your ghastly art dealer  theyre on the same train and the cars meeting them so theyll have time to change  and he isnt a dealer hes a historian  is he indeed lawks amercy  i wish i knew why he was coming  he wants to discuss the painting with you  yes is that so shocking  id better get on  oh mr molesley ive not been told  whether lord flintshire and mr bricker will be bringing valets  could you see theyre properly attended  well ive got a lot on my plate mr carson  i am sorry mr molesley but you are   yes i know i know im the first footman   well im not delirious but who is i have a pretty good life  well im glad  i was never the type to die of a broken heart you know  im sorry if that offends you  on the contrary i only hope tony feels the same  goodness i wasnt expecting that  i wish i could work you out  i wish i could work me out  when will you tell him tomorrow  im meeting him at noon  by the peter pan statue in kensington gardens  wont that make him dream of happy families  well its too late to change it now  whats he done wrong  nothing  im very fond of him ill always be fond of him  i want him to be the godfather of my children just not their father  how will he take it not as well as you  well youve got a way to soften the blow if you want to  i dont see how dont you  you seem a little subdued tonight do i granny  how strange i wonder why  i know it sounds hard but you must learn to leave things behind  i suppose you mean im to leave michael behind now  as youve already made it quite clear im to leave the baby behind  i would never suggest anything that is not in your interest  in my interest or the familys  to me they are the same  and that is where we differ  ive been thinking about your missing person  oh i dont want to be a nuisance  but arent there departments devoted to finding people who are lost  alas not at my command and the russians who were driven out  have spread to the four corners of the earth  who is this woman an old friend of yours  no shes the wife of an old friend  oh just see what you can do shrimpie  aunt violet  if i can still call you aunt violet   i ought to warn you about something  i can guess what it is you wont approve  no i dont  you may even feel the need to take sides susan is your niece  well i think youre making a serious mistake but you may rest easy on that score  i never take sides in a broken marriage  why is that  because however much the couple may strive to be honest  noone is ever in possession of the facts  are you in a hurry to leave tomorrow  not at all in fact at the risk of being a burden  i thought i might stay another night  when are you off tomorrow hes staying for a couple of days  is he well i hope weve got enough here to amuse you  come into the library excuse me  why not invite miss bunting to dinner tomorrow night  mary will be back  well be quite a party edith persuade him  i dont think papa would think it a very good idea  whats this i wanted torn to invite miss bunting to dinner tomorrow  but edith says robert wont allow it  nonsense of course you must bring her if you like i insist  so youve enjoyed bombay for the most part oh yes  its a wonderful city the gateway to the glories of the east  i felt very privileged  i gather things have not improved with susan  no  the times ive blessed you and cora for keeping rose out of it  what happens now  divorce im afraid i cant see any other way  but my dear chap is it worth it  why cant you just live apart  if youd ever been as unhappy as i am youd know why not  has molesley gone to bed  yes why  mrs patmore needs two more chafing dishes first thing tomorrow  you can tell him in the morning  youre not so pally now are you  why are you still up  i just want to get this finished  your father was never ill was he  im sorry  are you the one whos ill is that it is that why you went away  whats it to do with you im right arent i  youre ill and you went away to be treated  and now youre trying to carry on with the treatment yourself  well it has nothing to do with you so just leave me alone  robert asked why we couldnt stay together for the look of the thing  i hope you see that we cant  but daddy where are you going to live  your mother will keep upper brook street  im not sure where im going to go yet but ill find something  oh can i live with you  to be honest i think you should stay here for a while  the next part could be quite unpleasant  im learning from it though  i dont care how eligible some chap may be  im not going to be bullied  fighting talk i mean it  you all think that now im officially out its time to find my man  but im only going to marry if im totally absolutely in love  of course  when i find him will you promise to be on my side  promise you wont try to force me into a suitable marriage like you were forced  in other words youre asking for a blank cheque  yes  thats just what i want  oh my dearest one  on the subject of marriage i have no right to give advice  let alone orders  you must make haste to reach dieppe  where you are to seek out a mr avebury  he will arrange for you to be taken aboard a packet and conveyed to safety  but do not delay if you hold your mother dear  poor woman i know how she felt  as for your collection mr avebury will do what he can  but id rather every canvas or carving were tossed in the sea  to your being one extra hour in that unhappy country  im glad he didnt take her advice  he did not he brought crates and crates over  then went back after the reign of terror to buy more  and you have preserved them safely in this beautiful place  im glad you think its beautiful  i think everything about downton is beautiful including its mistress  you mustnt say such things i have to or ill burst  whats burst  i was just saying that  being allowed to touch a painting like this will make me burst  its wonderful to show it to someone so appreciative yes  noone could say youre not appreciative mr bricker  i cant be hearing this correctly im afraid you are  so you sleep with a man because he wants to marry you  but now you change your mind its insane  im sorry if you think so  well i wont let it happen i love you and you love me  at least you told me so in liverpool  i know and i thought i meant it  well whats changed i cant explain exactly  but something has thats all  am i a bad lover is that what youre trying to tell me  dont be silly its not that at all  its just i feel ive sort of woken up out of a dream  how flattering we go to bed together and you wake up  im just not sure we have enough in common to make a go of things  well i refuse to accept it  i refuse to believe that a woman like you a lady  could give herself to a man without first being certain that he was the one  so what are you saying this is something weve got to get through  and we will we will get through this together  mr molesley you wanted to see me  only to say  that im not sure i should be called the first footman after all mr carson  are you not no  well its not like the old days is it  i mean the duties of the first footman are shared between a lot of people now arent they  are they well they should be  because ive got the duties of the second and third footman to deal with  so you dont feel you need the precedence that the title first footman confers  er well not really no  very well  ill see what i can do  i wasnt sure youd want to come nonsense  im flattered to be asked  i didnt think i would be again not after last time  try to be nice to him tonight  i will be if hes nice to me  i know you dont like him or any of them much  but you forget one thing  they are good to me in their way  and i love them  i dont want you to hate them  just to realise that youre more than a retainer  i cant bear for you to waste your life propping up a system thats dying  well it wont die before dinner  someones dropped this in the passage the london magazine  does it belong to any of you mr barrow was reading it earlier  would you give it to him when he comes down miss baxter of course  where did you get this have you been in my room  of course not you dropped it in the passage mrs hughes found it  mrs hughes found it but miss baxter read it  im sorry for what youve gone through if what i think is correct  dont you pity me  dont you dare pity me  did you bring the photographs of della francescas nativity  i certainly did we can compare them to the painting tomorrow  it would be so lovely if it does turn out to be a study for it  yes it would be absolutely lovely  mr bricker one more word and i will ask you to sit somewhere else  he flatters her he keeps asking her opinion on everything  well dont you ever ask her opinion  of course i do sometimes  did you have a good time in london quite good  i set myself rather a difficult task  and its always a relief when its done isnt it   how are your lessons going  whats this  miss bunting is giving instruction to mrs patmores undercook  oh yes i heard about that  you sound as if you dont approve i approve  as long as youre not making her unsettled  you dont know her name do you  sarah please of course he does  daisy  well he knows it now i knew it before  and it sounds as if youre upsetting her and mrs patmore  i think you should drop this  why dont you send for her bring daisy in and ask her yourself  im sure shes too busy not too busy to answer a summons from you  we dont want to embarrass her  carson  this is the busiest time of their day mlord maybe it would be better   no fetch her  and ask mrs patmore to come up as well  very good mlord  your father may regret this  i wondered if you wanted a hand almost done  you could put the cases away if youve a mind  did you enjoy yourself we werent there long enough  i went to deliver a letter to lord gillingham in albany  oh yes  then i walked into piccadilly  his lordships lucky to live there  do you recall mr green saying that saying what  jimmy heard where he lived and called him a lucky tyke  he wasnt very lucky in the end though was he  no he wasnt lucky in the end  right ill take these up to the luggage room  is something wrong with the dinner mlord not at all  we apologise mrs patmore  for interfering with your duties in this strange and inconsiderate way  mrs patmore carson tells me  you feel daisys lessons have disturbed the peace of the kitchen  did you say that i dont know what i said  i was upset about that other business  i wondered if it were true daisy  well im sorry if ive made trouble downstairs  well you havent not really  but i must say this mlord  miss bunting here has opened my eyes to a world of knowledge i knew nothing of  maybe ill stay a cook all my life  but i have choices now interests facts at my fingertips  and id never have had any of that if she hadnt come here to teach me  brava well said  quite a testimonial may we go mlord  weve still got the pudding and the savouries  of course thank you  obviously the lessons have proved successful  im pleased to hear it  are you lord grantham  oh for heavens sake let it go youve proved your point  have i though all ive proved is that lord grantham  would like us serfs to stay in our allotted place from cradle to grave  there is only one thing i would like  and that i would like passionately  it is to see you leave this house and never come back  happy now  edith dear are you still writing that very interesting column  yes granny  oh you must show me some of them  what is the latest one about  what are they all about the way the world is changing  whats happening whats all the commotion  he just left the room  oh i dont mean to interrupt  no no we were just discussing the battle of little bighorn  the battle of little minx more like  to speak to his lordship in that manner in his own house  its true then i thought mr barrow might be exaggerating  it seems he wasnt for once  mr branson must be horrified to have brought her here  i dont know  i like him but sometimes i think weve forgotten the mr branson that was down here with us  spouting keir hardie between every mouthful  theyve made him one of them in a way but its not who he really is  then it makes me wonder whether downton is the place for him  a question im sure hes asked himself many times  i cant stand that woman no great surprise there  i suppose you think i made a fool of myself  what does it matter i dont see that you were much better  flirting and twinkling with that ghastly travelling salesman  go to sleep and when you wake up  make sure you get out of bed on the right side  good night tom  and cheer up you gave granny a wonderful evening  well what a todo  it seems to me your friend miss bunting is out to make trouble  shes brought me to life mrs patmore  all the same she wouldnt win a popularity contest upstairs  would you like to write a letter to the war office  oh dont be daft i mean it  if you think archies been badly treated you must protest  i wouldnt know how to write a letter like that  i can write it for you it wont do any good  his lordship says there are rules in place he wouldnt lie  no but if you protest and then over the years more and more others protest  then they might change their blessed rules  this is your learning isnt it  thats what youre trying to show me  youre not afraid  no im not  well go on then  well do it tomorrow  how can we help you this time its an odd business  since all this started theyve kept a plainclothes man on watch  at lord gillinghams set in albany  and now im told that mrs bates was seen there loitering outside  well i know why that would be  lady mary must have wanted to see lord gillingham while she was in london  no doubt anna was sent with a message to arrange a meeting  i knew youd have something sensible to say sergeant  well it seems likely  but from there mrs bates walked into piccadilly  to the spot where mr green died  theres no possibility she might have a grudge against him  that mr bates might share  not that im aware as i recall she rather liked him  mrs hughes yes she liked him so she said  they may want to question her but before they do they want me to check one thing  she was definitely here on the day of his death here at downton  i believe so surely you cant think that mrs   im not paid to think mrs hughes just to record the facts  hong kong a lot of the tsarist sympathisers ended up there  how did they survive as servants and taxi drivers  milliners and prostitutes anything they could lay their hand to  i will not suggest to which of those callings the princess kuragin was most suited  if you dislike her so much why are you going to all this trouble  because i owe it to her why  by the way susan has written to annabel  to say that shes furious that youve all taken me in  oh dear susan has been in a rage since she was playing with her dolls  i am proof against her tantrums  i would rephrase that if you want to stay neutral  i wont take sides  its true  but i dont think i could ever be described as neutral  have you apologized to tom  i never knew anyone who could provoke me into saying so many things i dont believe  but i am sorry tom please forgive me  she knows how to goad you with the precision of a surgeon  why do you go on with her since sybil died  ive forgotten what its like to be with someone who feels about things as i do  thats why or thats been why  to me its as if youd joined us and now youre backing away  what are we doing here  i want to explain why i think we should turn down wavells offer  i know we are only the caretakers of downton  but papa some things have to change  true but we mustnt destroy what were trying to protect  wavell would wreck this lovely place for ever with his ugly cheap houses  but you cant block all development i wont  i intend to expand but without spoiling  im going to make a plan and find a solid builder  who can fit in to the village and not ruin it  that may be hard to achieve it may be harder  than cashing wavells cheque but does that mean we shouldnt we  no  we will build  well even make money for the estate  but we wont destroy what people love about this place  do you think thats wrong  no its not wrong  thats all im asking  have any of you heard of someone called atticus aldridge  i should think carefully before you say one more word  im afraid youve read somewhere that rudeness in old age is amusing  margie feels you want the child to be your plaything how can she say that  and you liked mr green yes i did very much  you despise the family but i think you forget  my child is one of them
