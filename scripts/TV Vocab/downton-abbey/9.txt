                 downton abbey season 2 episode 2  letter for you william  why on earth are you doing that  well someones got to yes indeed they do  and that someone is william or one of the maids  youre making work for yourself mr carson  and ive no sympathy with that im not asking for sympathy  i dont think you should be what  for heavens sake if somethings wrong put it right  im sorry lang i dont mean to snap  not to worry my lord youve been in the trenches i have not  i have no right to criticise  im not a soldier now  youve been invalided out that is perfectly honourable  is it  people look at me and wonder why im not in uniform  then you refer them to me and ill give them a piece of my mind  hm  penny for your thoughts theyre worth a great deal more than that  what is it my papers theyve come ive been called up  oh you never have what does it mean  i report for my medical on wednesday and once  im through that i go to richmond for training  then you go to war with any luck ill be beggared if its over before i get there  if theyd listen to me itd be over by tea time  daisy i wonderwould you give me a picture to take with me  i havent got one then have one taken on your afternoon off please  thats enough let her get on with her work  hows thomas coming along  i wish he could be treated at our hospital here  well its only for officers of course  although ideally hed love to be transferred there to work  he wont be sent back to the front not with his hand the way it is  its such a pity he isnt under dr clarkson  we might have been able to influence him a bit i should hope so  without this family and all the money youve  spent his precious hospital wouldnt exist at all  perhaps ill ask his advice you never know  i was sure youd have a good idea of what to do for the best  fancy a tour in england davis  i assume youre having me on sir  not at all general sir herbert strutt  has asked for my transfer to be his adc  hes touring england to boost recruitment i know manchester and yorkshire well  it would mean a few months at home and a promotion to captain  i cant object to that  ive only got a few days before the medical my lady  then go and tell your father  you dont mind do you carson we must manage  with no footman at all from next wednesday  itll be no different if we start now and youve always got lang  we wish you every good fortune dont we darling  we certainly do  good luck william thank you my lord  so both my footmen have gone to the war  while i cut ribbons and make speeches  and keep peoples spirits up  which is very important  by god i envy them though  i envy their self respect and i envy their ability to sleep at night  mr carson doesnt like the smell of cleaning  materials in here not just before luncheon  come on mrs obrien we dont want to be unfriendly do we  you obviously dont  finish it now but dont blame me if mr carson takes a bit out of you  hello mr lang everything all right  why do you say that  no reason i only meant i hope youre enjoying yourself  i know i would be in your shoes  you never tried for the job did you i never got the chance  id no sooner heard that mr bates was gone than he arrived  what brings you here mr molesley  i was wondering if anna was anywhere around  i could find her if you like oh no no no  just give her this we were talking about it the other day  and i came across a copy inripon  elizabeth and her german garden  whatevers that about  its about an invitation to talk some more thats what  goodbye dr clarkson  lady grantham  id love to help but its not within my power  to hook men from hither and thither as i please  thats not at all what i was asking  i thought you were saying you wanted corporal barrow  to come and work here when hes fully recovered  i think it a credit to him that he wants to continue to serve in this way  after hes been wounded well thats as maybe  but its not for me to decide what happens next  mr carson are you quite well  oh leave me alone  after 24 hours it disappeared are you all right carson of course  that is perfectly all right your ladyship thank you  er no  cousin isobel says matthews coming home in a fortnight  hes touring england with some general  well have a dinner when hes here  i was going to ask richard carlisle about then for saturday to monday  be careful mary sir richard mustnt think youre after him  isnt that the truth the truth is neither here nor there  its the look of the thing that matters ask rosamund  itll take the edge off it thatll be nice  like before the war  how can we manage a prewar house party without a single footman  my dear rosamund is not a house party  shes blood  i saw mrs drake when i went into the village  the wife of john drake who has longfield farm  oh what did she have to say  apparently their final ablebodied farmhand has been called up  they need a man to drive the tractor  hasnt drake recovered from his illness i thought he was better hes much better  but he doesnt drive  so i told her i could do it  what i said i could drive the tractor  edith you are a lady not toad of toad hall  well im doing it  dont look so bewildered its simple  i will drive the tractor  well can you do that absolutely  can you hitch up the plough or whatever it is im dragging  of course when would you like me to start  id better get you something to wear  oh i like a bit of life in a house but i just  hope mr carson doesnt spontaneously combust  i had a letter yesterday  yes its my sisters boy  hes with the lancashire fusiliers  only hes gone missing  missing presumed dead they call it  oh no  how did it happen they cant find out  how it happened why it happened  whether we can be sure it did happen or he isnt lying prisoner somewhere  ask his lordship hell have friends in the war office they can dig something up  oh i dont like to bother him  why not hes got broad shoulders  thats ever so fine mr lang  how can you make those big hands do such delicate work  i expect theres no end to the things they could manage  giving you a slap for a start  that is good very good  i like to see a proper skill  blokes think they can be a valet if they can smile and tie a shoelace  but theres an art to it and i can tell youve got it  my mother taught me  she was a ladys maid like you  well she knew what she was about  oh mr lang as you know sir richard carlisle arrives later  and the crawleys are coming for dinner tonight  i really cant have maids in the dining room for such a party  so id be grateful if youd help me and play the footman  me wait at table  well its not ideal but im afraid ive no choice  the footmans liveries are in a cupboard past mrs hughes sitting room  you should find one to fit you  im not sure what i can do but im happy to try  whats his name archie  that is archibald philpotts  he was in the lancashire fusiliers  they think he was in northern france  you realise the most likely outcome is that he has indeed been killed  i understand my lord but wed rather know the worst than wonder  hm  ah oh hello mr molesley  what are you doing here i asked inside and they said you were at the laundry  lady mary is wearing this tonight i wasnt sure it was done  i wondered if youd had a chance to read that book  you only gave it to me yesterday of course of course  but when you have read it i hope we can exchange our views  thatd be nice perhaps we might bring some of the others in  we could have a sort of reading club  we could do that  or we could talk about it together just we two  heavens its later than i thought i must get on  im off to change but i wanted you to know i sent a note to clarkson  which should do the trick what did you say  that youd asked a favour and given that the estate shoulders the hospital costs  it did seem unfair if we werent allowed a few perks  quite right thank you darling  well done my lady  ready  ready  come on damn you  whoahoho yes  to the victorthe spoils  did you plant that tree  steady on it must be 40 years old  its not a flattering light  my father planted it but you have to be tough with fruit trees  not let them outstay their welcome  farming needs a kind of toughness doesnt it  theres room for sentiment but not sentimentality  beautifully put if i may say so my lady  you should be a writer thank you  how are you getting on very well i think  its not too hard for you not at all shes stronger than she looks  ive brought you something to eat my lady  im afraid its not what youre used to  hey its not for you  so it is you  ethel thought i must have a soldier fancy man  is she the new maid yes  shes a soppy sort  so tell me was dr clarkson thrilled to have your services  its major clarkson now but yes  i dont know how you did it  what about your blighty  my god its not so bad  and it lived up to its name and got me home  youd better come inside  wheres william training for the army  i thought he might have died for love of you  dont be nasty as soon as youre back  imagine carson without a footman like a ringmaster without a pony  well have none of your cheek thank you thomas  im very sorry mrs hughes but im not servant any more  i take my orders from major clarkson  whos this ethel the new maid i told you  i didnt realise i was dealing with an exfootman  im the one that got away  gives hope to us all  ethel help with the luggage theyre nearly back with sir richard  weve got a visitor mr carson ive seen him  wheres mr bates gone replaced by mr lang  so not all the changes were bad  oh were so pleased to have you here sir richard  lady grantham welcome thank you  i hope the train wasnt too tiring hello mary  not a bit no i got a lot done hello aunt rosamund  brother dear how are you  lovely to see you rosamund  hes nice isnt he he spent the entire journey reading his own papers  but im sure ill love him dearly if hell ever look up from the page  branson when youve finished unloading  go to the hospital and remind lady sybil that we expect her for dinner  and tell her i mean it  really theyre working her like a packhorse in a mine  i think she enjoys it though  please tell her to come home in time to change  i cant possibly come really mama is incorrigible  its not poor bransons fault  what is the point of mamas soirees what are they for  well im going up for dinner and im glad is that wrong  thomas  you can cover for nurse crawley cant you  i can  so youre back then safe and sound  thats not how id put it with my hand the way it is  but yes major clarksons found me a place and im grateful  can you give lieutenant courtenay his pills  of course i can be glad to  is everything under control  mr lang seems a bit nervous  stage fright but what about you  ohim a trouper  and we cant complain can we not when you think whats going on in france  stilla broken heart can be as painful as a broken limb  dont feel sorry for me mrs hughes im not  i know what real love is and there arent many who can say that  im one of the lucky ones  if you say so  so the fashion for cocktails before dinner hasnt reached yorkshire  i could get carson to make you one but i wont guarantee the result  mrs crawley captain crawley and miss swire  ah isobel  well now still in one piece  thank god touch wood i never stopped touching it  do you know sir richard carlisle my cousin captain crawley  how do you do and his fiancee miss swire  i know miss swire her uncle and i are old friends  well old acquaintances anyway  what do you think mary sees in him besides the money you mean  it must be more than that for younot necessarily for her  whats general strutt like well you know rather important  and brave he got the dso in south africa  is there any chance it might be permanent that we can count you out of danger  it would be such a relief i wouldnt want that im afraid  hes promised to get me back to france  hows your appointment with the north ridings working out  oh that w  it seems i wont be going to the front after all  i made a mistake  they only wanted a mascot  mary tells me youre in newspapers  well i own a few oh  that must be quite a responsibility  at a time like this you know in a war  when its so important to keep peoples spirits up  lady grantham my responsibility is to my investors  i need to keep my readership up i leave public spirits to government propaganda  so now youve met granny  i warn you she has very strong opinions  oh you need have no fear where thats concerned my dear  were more than evenly matched  where are the spoons for this just here  oh my god ive forgotten the sauce  mr langs bringing the sauce and the melba toast right good  now mr lang are you ready i think so  its always the left and not ladies first  no just follow mr carson  start with old lady grantham then his lordship then just go on round  you must have done this before not since the war started  i dont think i even knew that why int it just ladies first  wouldnt it be more polite thats how its done  on the continent we dont like foreign ways here  i gather your footman thomas has returned to the village no  crikey where did you see him  at the hospital seems hes working there  i wonder how he wangled that  what do you make of our plutocrat  hes an opportunity marys needs a position  and preferably a powerful one he can provide it  you dont think shed be happier with a more traditional setup  will she have the option  thank you but i already have some no no give that to me  oh i do apologise my lady  mr lang get a cl  carson carson whats the matter  now carson its all right everything will be fine  edith go with branson and fetch major clarkson  ill telephone and explain what about my dress  edith will get you a coat come  sybil will know what to do until the doctor comes  theres never a dull moment in this house  lady sybil and i will take him upstairs mrs hughes will show us the way  i can help no let me i know what im doing  im sure thats not necessary my lady  its not my lady now carson its nurse crawley  anna and ethel i must trust the dinner to you  id say the first course is a thing of the past  then clear and lay the hot plates  daisy you fetch the beef and the rest of it anna you serve the wine  mr lang you can clear up the mess  ill do that theres no need i dont mind i thank you  mr lang youd better go downstairs  well clarksons seen him  its definitely not a heart attack but he does need rest  hes working much too hard  for a start hes just got to let the maids serve in the dining room  quite right there is a war  even carson has to make sacrifices  poor lang he looked like a rabbit in front of a snake  i dont understand it he seemed so solid when i met him  even taciturn now hes a bundle of nerves  i heard what you said to matthew about the regiment  everyone else knows what a fool i made of myself why shouldnt he  i dont think youre a fool isnt that enough  no  maybe it should be but it isnt  are you all right mr lang  youre not are you  ive seen shell shock before you know  i had a brother with it  my favourite brother as it happens  and i was his favourite too  they sent him back and hes dead now  they wont send me back  im a goner as far as theyre concerned  you shouldnt be working yet i must work  i dont know what to do else  i have to work  mr lang i thought youd gone up  he wanted to hang up the livery before it got creased  well we can discuss the dinner another time  ill say good night good night mrs hughes good night  may i come in  thats very kind of you my lady but do you think you should  lets hope my reputation will survive it  and rest easy please  i gather it isnt too serious oh ive been very stupid my lady  i let myself get flustered  i regard that as highly unprofessional  it wont happen again dont be too hard on yourself  i was particularly sorry to spoil things for sir richard  knowing he was a guest of yours dont be  i think he found it all quite exciting  will we be seeing a lot of him  i dont know maybe  and captain crawley  is he happy with the changes so to speak  may i give you one piece of advice my lady  tell him whats in your heart  if you still love him let him know  then even if hes killed and he may be you wont be sorry  but if you dont tell him you could regret it all your life long  and what about miss swire  wellmiss swire  as if any man in his right mind could prefer miss swire to you  oh im so sorry my lady i didnt know you were in here  i was just going carsons been boosting my confidence  thats something id never have thought she was short of  what about you sir  what did you do before the war started  i was up at oxford  but i only ever planned to farm  farm and shoot  and hunt and fish  and everything ill never do again  you dont know that weve had cases of gas blindness wearing off  rare cases  and much sooner than this  it doesnt help me to be lied to you know  im finished  and id rather face it than dodge it  id better go  wheres rosamund shes with your mama  trying to talk her into the idea of sir richard  you dont sound very enthusiastic  are you  can we stop for a minute  dont tell me youre tired im not tired im hot  this tweed is too thick  it looks more suited to shooting than walking  i had it made for the weekend i didnt know there was a difference  it doesnt matter thats like the rich who say money doesnt matter  it matters enough when you havent got it  i know you dont care about our silly rules  youre always very clear on that score  you make me sound rude and i hope im not that  i mean to learn how to do things properly and you could help me a lot  but im not ashamed of being what they call a selfmade man  im proud of it  is the point of all this to test me in some way  maybe  are you shocked by my bold and modern values  oh sir richard you flatter yourself  it takes a good deal more than that to shock me  but mama who do you imagine is out there with more to offer  im not a romantic i should hope not  but even i will concede that the heart does not exist  solely for the purpose of pumping blood  that is charming especially from you  but mary seems to haveblotted her copybook in some way  so she needs a suitable marriage that will mend her fences  well how do we know carlisle is suitable  who is he whod ever heard of him before the war  sir richard is powerful and rich and well on the way to a peerage  of course he may not be all that one would wish  but mary can soon smooth off the rough edges  well you should know what do you mean by that  marmaduke was a gentleman  marmaduke was the grandson of a manufacturer  his mother was the daughter of a baronet maybe  but they were no great threat to the plantagenets  the point is i made up for any social deficiencies  and he provided me with a position  it was a good exchange and it worked well  how can matthew have chosen that little blonde piece  you speak so eloquently of the human heart mama  you must be aware of itsvagaries  things cannot be as they were and jack has your best interests at heart  stop  whos jack  my younger brother  he means to replace me  its what hes always wanted  yeahwell  im sorry  i mustnt bore you  dont let them walk all over you  youve got to fight your corner  what with your brain  youre not a victim dont let them make you into one  you know when you talk like that  i almost believe you  you should believe me  all my life theyve  pushed me around just cos im different  how why are you different  never mind  look  look ii dont know if youre going to see again or not  but i do know you have to fight back  how dare you threaten me how dare i  i assure i dare a great deal more than that  but you cant you wouldnt i didnt say i would  i was merely reminding you it was in my power  lady painswick lady rosamund  im sorry ill get these things sorted out before long  its not important  miss swire and i were just talking about old times  happy old times i hope  will you forgive me i want to write some letters before dinner  lets have a rest weve earned it  i should have got a glass you cant drink out of a bottle my lady  i wish youd call me edith  and of course i can drink from the bottle  would you like me to teach you to drive  not muchcos then you wouldnt come here no more  although that wouldnt matter to you  why do you say that  youre pretty and clever and fine  youre from a different world  is something wrong no just having a break  because you want to get into town to fetch the bone meal  and be back in time to feed the cows before its dark  they could always have a midnight feast  thats it sir if you move the stick fast enough you dont have to slacken your pace  check the width of the space as well as any obstruction  lieutenant courtenay well done  youre making good progress thanks to my saviours sir  so youll be pleased to hear that its time to continue your treatment elsewhere  what at farley hall  youre not ill any more all you need is time to adjust to your condition  the staff at farley can help with that  but sir these two are helping me here  nurse crawley and corporal barrow are not trained in specialist care  please dont send me away  not yet  sir surely we  lieutenantyou must know that every one of our beds is needed  for the injured and dying from arras  hm  corporal ill see you in my office  sir i only meant to say that lieutenant courtenay is depressed  i will not leave wounded soldiers freezing or sweating under canvas  because a junior officer is depressed  yes i thought you may want to know what i think  why should i  nurse crawley i may not be your social superior in a mayfair ballroom  but in this hospital i have the deciding voice  please help him prepare his belongings he leaves in the morning  anna and ethel will wait at the table i will supervise whats wrong with that  nothing except that its how a chartered accountant has his dinner served  i can think of worse insults if you say so  but i dont want lang allowed anywhere near it  oh mr bates where are you when we need you  can you bring me the wine ledgers and ill make a selection  his lordships already done that just try to rest  to rest or to feel redundant  both if itll slow you down for a minute and a half  the world does not turn on the style of a dinner  my world does  how does he know miss swire  what miss swire  they were in the garden when i came back from mamas  i suppose they met in london  would you like me to come back later my lady no come in  i was just leaving  hows carson getting on oh much better my lady  mrs hughes is having a job keeping him in bed  he gave me some advice last night  oh yes  was it good advice  it was about honesty  he thinks i should say what i really feel  sounds a bit wild for mr carson  do you think hes right  well they do say honesty is the best policy  and i think you regret being honest  less often than you regret telling lies  he must have smuggled a razor into his bed  there was nothing to be done  its because we ordered him to go we dont know that  this is a tragedy i dont deny it  but i cannot see what other course was open to me  we have no room for men to convalesce  and farley is the nearest house i can send them to  there is a solution and its staring us in the face  downton abbey would they ever allow it  or even consider it i think they would  after this i think they can be made to  but sir richard you dont have to  richard please  you see i want you to marry me  why  because i think very highly of you  very highlygoodness  i mean it i think wed do well together  we could be a good team  now that sounds better  but i cant help thinking  that tradition demands a little mention of love  oh i can talk about love and moon and june  and all the rest of it if you wish  but were more than that  were strong and sharp  and we can build something worth having you and i if youll let us  your proposal is improving by leaps and bounds  you must give me some time  but i promise to think about it properly  im counting on it  if you just go to that one over there  youre right here right to the other end down you go  her ladyship had mrs patmore make this up for you  so you could eat something during the day  dr clarkson good morning  oh matthew  im afraid im very busy as you can see yes i just want to help  right over there  is it what you thought it would be  no no its more savage and more cruel than i could have imagined but  i feel useful for the first time in my life that must be a good thing  matthew are you busy no of course not  ill just get you on to your bed  youre quite safe  so you wouldnt go back  to your life before the war  no no i could never go back to that again  lavinia  whats the matter  are you looking for matthew  i wasbut its not important  tell me what it isplease  he has to go a day early tomorrow morning in fact  only to meet his general surely not back to france  but he must go back one day  i cant imagine what id do if anything happened to him  i know hell be all right  no you dont none of us do  we say that sort of thing but we dont know  if he died i dont think i could go on living  whats doing  excuse me  lavinias a bit upset  shes awfully cut up that i have to go early  but its only to coventry  which doesnt sound too dangerous  if youre looking for mother shes at the hospital  actually its you i came to see oh how can i help  mary can you stay for luncheon  i cantbut thank you  so what was your mission  just to say  we hope youre still coming for dinner tonight  certainly we are why wouldnt we  sure itll be your last evening  why dont you want me of course i want youvery much  im sorry youve had a wasted journey not at all  i needed an excuse for a walk  ill see you at eight  ethel said you wanted me no no i just need a word with you  if its about the book im afraid  its not about the book  what is it then  i understand that mr bates has gonefor good  yes i believe thats true  so i was hoping  we might be able to see a little more of each other  mr molesley  i take this as a real compliment  but its not going to happen  no  you see  if you had a child and that child was taken from you  if the child was sent to the moon  thered never be one day when they were out of your thoughts  no moment when you werent praying for their welfare  even if you knew youd never see them again  thats you and mr bates  thats me and mr bates  but thank you  ive kept you too long you should get back or theyll be looking for you  weve done a lot havent we we have  ill have to invent some tasks or theyll be no need for you to come much more  then start inventing please  i will  cos id hate it if you were to stay away  so would i  id absolutely hate it  i cant believe ive done that im awfully glad you did  youll have me thrown in the tower  only if they give me the key  fold it in dont slap it  youre making a cake not beating a carpet  oh sorry your lordship i didnt see you there  its quite all right mrs patmore  i wonder is there somewhere we could have a word er  er why not go into my sitting room  please sit  i do have some news of your nephew  i telephoned the war office theyve just come back to me but its not good news  i knew he was dead all along  i said so to my sister i said kate hes gone and youll have to fa   mrs patmore its worse than that  what can be worse than being dead  private philpotts was shot for cowardice on 17 february  oh my god  this explains why the regiment was reluctant to supply information  mrs hughes could you come in please  mrs patmore has had some bad news her nephew has been killed  oh he never has and thats not all  it is all mrs patmore  let us make sure it is all  your sister needs to know no more than this  we cannot know the truth we should not judge  i think its a ridiculous idea  why because this is a house not a hospital  granny a convalescent home is where people rest and recuperate  but if there are relapses what then  amputation in the dining room resuscitation in the pantry  it would be the most tremendous disturbance  if you knew how chaotic things are as it is  but when so much good can be done  i forbid it  to have strange men prodding and prying around the house  to say nothing of pocketing the spoons  its out of the question i hesitate to remind you  but this is my house roberts and mine and we will make the decision  oh i see  so now im an outsiderwho need not be consulted  since you put it like that yes  what was it like at the hospital today  at the front  the men pray to be spared of course  but if thats not to be  they pray for a bullet that kills them cleanly  for too many of them today that prayer had not been answered  well eat in about 20 minutes  good and would you have any to spare for a poor traveller  william i dont believe it pinch me i am your dream come true  youre like a real soldier i am a real soldier thank you very much  now come and give me a kiss ooh  well have none of that wont you let a tommy kiss his sweetheart  when hes off to fight the hun have you finished your training  not yet but it wont be long on the eve of departure well see  but right now put her down  ill show you  what do you think there smart int it  william what a treat to see you  and how smart you look  welcome thanks supper wont be long  im just clearing the dining room shall i help  course not youre in the army now  so still full of the joys of war then  im not sorry to be part of it mr lang and i cant pretend i am  oh yes youre part of it  like a metal cog is part of a factory  or a grain of sand is part of the beach  its all right mr lang i understand  and im not saying im important or owt like that  but i believe in this war  i believe in what were fighting for and i want to do my bit  then god help you  edith seems jolly tonight  shes found her metier  farm labouring  dont be so tough on her  thats like asking the fox to spare the chicken  what about you last time you told me good news was imminent  would you be happy if it were of course  ive found someone now and i want you to do the same  if youd taken another minute to make up your mind  wed all have marched over the cliff  ill tell you something else as well  williams got more to say than a parliamentary candidate  whats the matter i know its my fault  but i wish i hadnt let him think that were like sweethearts  because were not not by my reckoning anyway  too late for second thoughts now missy  you dont have to marry him when it comes to it  but you cant let him go to war with a broken heart  or he wont come back  what a time weve had  poor sir richard must have thought hed come to a madhouse  i dont expect itll put him off  im going to accept him  do you think i should  thats not for me to say  if you love him more than anyone in the world then of course you should  its not as simple as that oh  it is for me  but then im not your ladyship  did you love bates more than anyone else in the world  i did  i do  ill never love again like i love him  ever  well there you are then  one day youll meet someone else and youll marry  perhaps itll be second best but  it doesnt mean you cant have a life  i think it doesfor me  are you sure you should be doing this weve managed well with mrs hughes  quite sure my lord  and breakfast is not a taxing assignment  edith this is a message for you mrs drake writes that theyve decided to hire a man  so they wont be needing you any more  is that all she says oh well shes very grateful  here she says she and drake send their thanks to you  for giving up so much of your valuable time  i expect its rather a relief  oh i wouldnt say that  not entirely has lady sybil gone already  she had a tray at half past six she would  carson did you know were to be turned into a hospital  a convalescent home  im afraid weve all bullied you into the whole thing  i hope youre not dreading it too much  not exactly but its a brave new world were headed for no doubt about that  we just try to meet it with as much grace as we can muster  i thought i saw mr bates isnt he in london  thomas the footman managing downton abbey  give orders for the beds the nurses and the patients  to be packed up and shipped out at once  do you remember when aunt rosamund  found you and richard carlisle in the garden  i hope you didnt unearth anything too fearful ask mary  ill get them one way or another  theres no need to be so rough  theres every needto stop a murder  are we engaged  its not against the law to take a mistress i know  you and i love you that is not the right path for you
