                 why didnt you wait for me  i wanted to finish these before breakfast is it something ive done  no not anything  nobodys done anything  blimey what happened to you  leave her alone i fell i cut my lip  now if either of you need help to carry things down just ask  alfred and james will be glad to help thats good to know  what was that james nothing mr carson  id better go up lady mary hasnt rung yet  ive things to do  how was anna when you lent her that dress last night  how should she be she told me shed fallen and cut her lip  but i wondered if it might be more serious  she always minimises things im sure i dont know anything you dont know  whats the matter with everyone this merry morn  i think theres something rather foreign about high spirits at breakfast  i shall be supervising the departure if anyone wants me  well mr gillingham i hope you havent forgotten anything  on the contrary mr carson i shall remember this visit for a long time  goodbye lord grantham and thank you for everything oh nonsense  im the one who should be thanking you  you look as if youre glad to see the back of us  no youve been kind to me  im afraid i havent been much fun to be with  griefs odd tom when the duke died it made me terribly clumsy  i kept dropping and breaking things  it was because it felt disloyal  to manage anything properly without him do you see  but you could manage yes i could  and so can you i wonder  the trouble is that im not really out and all that but it should be possible  i dont think people care about those rules like they used to well i dont  the luggage is loaded mlord  its nice to see youre well looked after  it seems rather ungrateful but i cant pretend i like him  but im lucky to have anyone nowadays  you said it  ill say goodbye to tony gillingham dont interrupt them yet  youre sure we cant meet  im sure youre much too busy and ill be chasing my tail  in other words no  im afraid youll have to get started they wont hold the train  not even for you  not for me nor for you either duchess not these days  you look very earnest  im on my way to convince the board of the merits of an out clinic  so people can come early for treatment  i dont suppose dont suppose what  i could do with some help i know you suspect me of trying to get you back into harness  but well it would leave a nurse free for other duties  ill think about it  i will  i promise  the tax people have had a cancellation so they can see us on wednesday at noon  but we should go up tomorrow i wouldnt like to risk being late  and you dont want me to come no point in you all going  are you afraid i might put the case for selling its not a question of that  they dont care how they get the money so long as they get it  ill ask how long they can give us and what scale of payment theyll accept  then ill report back and well make a decision together  but i will try to persuade you  even though youd be dragging a debt behind you for 20 years i dont care  not if downton is selfsufficient by the end of it  i can see ill spend the rest of my life paying by instalments  papa you always say were not the owners of downton but the caretakers  very well lets take care of it  aunt rosamund said we can stay with her  do you mind keeping an eye on the children mama  is this london when are you going can i come  tomorrow and i dont see why not nor me  will you meet tony gillingham while youre there  i dont think so why should i  just thought you might  dont be transparent mama it doesnt suit you  i thought you might come down to see me  after last night look edna  i blush to admit it but i was very drunk  so youre not going to deny it of course not  and if i behaved badly i am sorry  well have to put it down to our low spirits and self indulgence  i suppose youre so cold because youre ashamed of what you did  im neither cold nor ashamed but as i say  if i made a mistake then im sorry  i dare say we both are  what are you making there feuilletes  whats that puff pastry layers with asparagus  im doing the hollandaise do they really like that stuff or do they order it to show off  we dont all have to live off battered fish and meat pies  its the first thing mrs patmores trusted me with first big thing  im quite nervous so you should be  mess it up and its back to kindergarten  what are you doing  you cant treat a poor girl like this  like what to use her one minute and to cast her aside the next  ive said im sorry  yes youre sorry i know  but suppose im pregnant  what will you do then  dont be ridiculous you cant be pregnant its not as easy as that  but it is just as easy  why talk about it now you wont know for weeks  i must be sure that youll marry me if im carrying your child  i need to know that you wont cast me off that youll be a man of honour  and dont say im not good enough  if you were good enough for lady sybil crawley im good enough for you dont speak her name  you werent so severe last night  all i need is your word that youll marry me if theres a baby  dont worry if it happens i mean to make a go of being your wife  i wont hold you back  you wont have any regrets  i am already full of regrets  there is nothing but regret in me  did you enjoy the concert i did  it was a great treat to hear melba in person  hm and the evening generally  you mean did i find it hard to see mary come alive again  yes i did i confess it  but i dont think my feelings are at all defensible  they are defensible to me but its immoral  to react in such a jealous and selfish way  well if we only had moral thoughts  what would the poor churchmen find to do  im fond of mary  i love her  i dont want her to be alone and unhappy  it makes no sense even to me  i dont criticise either you or her  but i hope you find a way to make friends with the world again  when we get to london would you mind helping lady rose  we cant take madge off lady edith  anna are you all right yes  only youve been very quiet  will that be all mlady  yes i suppose so very good mlady  i telephoned rosamund  i thought mary was doing that yes but i wanted to speak to her  thats a first shell give a little dinner  what about tom she said she wont mind if he wants to be included  who could resist such a love call  shell ask that young man for rose so it wont be too obvious  itll be pretty obvious do you think something might come of it  probably not but i wouldnt mind if it did  after all being a family means welcoming new members  dont you agree braithwaite  i think anyone would be lucky to be a part of this family mlady  thats nice thank you  arent we encouraging a nation of hypochondriacs if they rush to a doctor at every twinge  i think it encourages people to look after themselves and not become a burden  so you mean to help a little  just to provide some free labour no more than that  i wish someone would provide me with some free labour oh  lloyd george would never allow it  rosamund is so looking forward to seeing you poor aunt rosamund  we use her like an hotel she enjoys it  it gives her a surrogate real life  what do you think tom do you think she minds  tom  im sorry what were you saying  id far rather know what you were thinking  let me taste it go on then  its like eating paper thank you  i mean it do you really care about this stuff  i want to be a good cook i want a skill  why shouldnt i you sound like alfred  well what do you want  to have a good time to see the world  to meet beautiful women and spend money and drink champagne  you cant make a career out of that  some people do i want a life thats fun  i wish i was more like you  i should report you to mrs patmore  report me for what you know  no he does not know and nor do i what dont you know  why everyones making a fuss over my cooking  because you did well ivy theyre not very hard  theyre hard enough for a beginner as you ought to remember  yes but ivy moves so fast for a beginner dont she  just one night well be back for dinner on wednesday  ill miss you dont  im sorry  im just tired  before you ask youve done nothing wrong i must have done something  you wont talk to me you wont look at me i cant come near you  were in each others pockets  we live together we work together  sometimes i think its just too much  theres not a lot to say  we worked in a few theatres together  she had a singing act with her sister  the lark and the dove they were called  which was she the dove i suppose  her sister had the voice  but alice was a gentle soul  a sweet and a gentle soul  and you were courting  well you know how it was then  not like today you were lucky if you got to walk them to the corner  but you wanted to marry her  so much i could taste it  i know where is that young man now so full of passion  anyway she chose charlie and that was that  but whats changed  he told me that she regretted it  that she wished shed chosen me  shes dead now so it doesnt matter but thats what she said  i disagree it matters a lot  the woman you loved loved you  but it doesnt change anything  it changes you from where im looking  youre busy no no no  ill say goodnight goodnight mr carson  what is it  when i get back from london i want to move back upstairs  what why for heavens sake  because i cant  i cant let him touch me  but whatever happened was not mr batess fault surely  of course not  he is without fault and thats the point  im not good enough for him not now  why say that because i think that somehow i  i must have made it happen  stuff and nonsense you were attacked by an evil violent man  there is no sin in that but i feel dirty  i cant let him touch me because im soiled  anna ive been thinking  we must go to the police no  but suppose youre with child what will you do then  ill kill myself i wont listen to that  no man should be able to do what he did and get away with it  and when mr bates has killed him  will you come with me to the prison when my husband is hanged  but the poor mans heart is breaking for not knowing  better a broken heart than a broken neck  so can i have a room please  you can  you must wait until theres some reason for you to give mr bates  but i wish you would decide that honesty is the best policy  in the meanwhile try to take a break from it  while youre in london  there can be no break from it  come and talk to me while im cleaning them ive got work to do five minutes  ivy can make the savoury theres only three of them itll be good practice  what about me collect the trays from the nursery and make the pancakes for pudding  put them in the steam warmer have you seen this  what theyre setting up a training school at the ritz hotel in london  in honour of monsieur escoffier  just for a few candidates how much will it cost nothing  if they pass the test they get free training a basic wage and the chance of a job after  they have two examinations a year you could do that daisy  are you trying to get rid of me wheres ivy she ought to see it  shes around here somewhere  shes in the boot room  sorry to keep you waiting but anna couldnt find   oh  i hope im a surprise and not a shock  well youre certainly unexpected  i thought id get up a small party just an informal one  you remember sir john bullock  he and lord gillingham have just been staying with us  cora said it had been a success how clever of you both to be free at such short notice  they brought your message to my club  i had an evening of cards and whisky ahead so it was a welcome change of plan  and what about you well i cancelled what i was supposed to be doing  i hope miss lane fox didnt mind  dont punish me for wanting to see you again  johns got a marvellous idea for later on havent you  after dinner i could take you all to hear the new band at the lotus club  you and mary can be my chaperones so what could be more proper  it isnt too jazzy lady rosamund just a club with a good dance band  we can keep the young in order  thats if you like the sound of it  please say yes mary do  its such eons since weve had any fun  what about you tom  ill stay here with lady rosamund oh i was thinking i might go too  that settles it tom can come as aunt rosamunds partner  well  i give in  some more champagne over here i dont need any more  nonsense how can we keep going if were not properly fuelled i can keep going  his evening of cards and whisky had already begun when he got your aunts invitation    still it holds a goodly share of bliss  i hope you dont mind my ambushing you like this  it was mama and aunt rosamund who ambushed me  and im glad you came  really absolutely  when im at downton i feel so weighed down  as if i were stuck at school for the rest of my life  but tonight youve made me play truant  and i like it    flowers    that bloom in may    so if its raining  can i see you again before you go  how the meetings at noon and then we go straight to the station  oh    its raining violets  and anyway youve told me youre engaged to be married  almost engaged  almost is good enough for me  and even if you werent the truth is  im not ready  and i wont be for some years  i dont believe that  dont misunderstand me  its been lovely here and at downton  i feel quite refreshed  but now its time to go back to real life again  and thats doesnt include me  how could it    whenever april showers come along    when i go through these i can tell ive got some big gaps  make a list and well see what we can do  youll help wont you course  i just think its a shame if alfred has to go  they might not even test me let alone offer me a place  i couldnt go to london me oh you could  if london was right for the next step in your journey  are you sure you want to be a chef not this chef business again  oh just because you have no dreams i have dreams  but they dont involve peeling potatoes  thats it im off to bed me too goodnight mrs patmore  you must help him daisy  although itll be hard  itll be better if you part friends i promise  one moment of nastiness and ill be paying for the rest of my days  maybe its good if he goes  sometimes you can spend too long on a onesided love    i see a light in your eyes  so how are you enjoying it what  being a member of the family crawley  theyve been kind to me kinder than i deserve  oh im sure thats not true it is true too true  oh oh dear er  should we sit down  aunt rosamunds gone back to the table should we go  absolutely not  um please  were making a show of ourselves then lets put on a great show  people are looking at us good let them see how its done  john oh my   are you all right oh um  hes not normally like that  oh mary  i dont think he is i dont know him that well  i should keep it that way  i really am all right now  thank you youve saved my face jack ross at your service  im rose macclare  how do you do rose  ive been sent to fetch you  well if your friends are waiting  im so sorry this is my cousin tom branson  this is mr ross he rescued me from deep humiliation  we should be going  there was no need to be rude i wasnt rude  wheres john i should think hes gone home  well have we all had enough i hope he paid the bill before he left  honestly if it hadnt have been for mr ross  you were having quite an adventure with your gallant band leader  he was terribly nice and  john had made me look such a fool    a violet renamed but still blue    the dappled dew will form in spring    no matter what you call the thing    so whats in a name    the grass is always greener    on the other side    im going up ill come with you im whacked  im assuming sir john bullock has blotted his copybook for you  oh i dont know doesnt everyone deserve a second chance not everyone no  things have come to a pretty pass when you have to be rescued by a black bandleader  i was jolly pleased anyone wanted to rescue me and so would you have been  whats the matter youve been in a glump all day  if i told you youd despise me  it may surprise you to hear that i said that to someone once  but i did confess in the end and it made things a lot better  well i couldnt say it not to you  then find someone you can tell  it will help more than you know  and on that modest note goodnight  goodnight  im glad someones cheerful  although im surprised its you  why  you were very down in the mouth when you were talking to mr branson  you think you can read me like a book dont you  i pride myself on keeping my eyes open yes  youll need to keep your eyes open and your ears too where im concerned  meaning meaning therell come a day when youll be glad you kept in with me  hello james alfred  rose anna needs to use your curling irons all right mine are broken  of course  youre back  good  how was it  all right  lady mary seemed quite pleased come here  better get on kiss me  please  or tell me whats happened one or the other dont bully me  anna youre upset youre unhappy and i dont know why  you say its not me i hope thats true but there is a reason and i need to find out what it is  i wont press you now if it makes things worse but in the end i will find out  anna could you tell lady mary lord gillingham is here  lord gillingham  but we just saw him in london well hes come back  is his valet with him  i mean is he staying shell want to know  he doesnt seem to be  now will you give her the message please  well this is a sorry tale  damn right it is and its all my fault  not all but it is partly your fault theres no point in denying that  and you expect me to help you with it  i couldnt think of anyone else to turn to  not the most flattering invitation ive ever known  the question is whats to be done  should i speak to her again should i beg  weve not quite come to that  it is you  when anna told me i thought there must be a mistake  how did you get here on the same train as you  but i was travelling in third  why because i didnt want to speak to you in a railway carriage  with you know tom and everyone else listening  would you like some tea yes if i may  i assume youre going to give me an explanation at some stage  its not complicated  i have made a long journey to ask a short question  will you marry me  tony you dont know me  how can you say that weve known each other since we were children  yes but with a very long gap in the middle  we only met properly a few days ago  and now you want to spend the rest of your life with me  yes  thats exactly what i want  i love you mary and there must be a way to convince you  ah james could you bring us some tea  very good mlady  look  i never met matthew but im sure he was a splendid chap  he was but hes dead and im alive  were good together mary  we could be so very happy if youd let us  and miss lane fox  i like mabel a lot  i even think that i could come to love her  but im not in love with her as i am with you  you fill my brain  i see you when i close my eyes  i cant stop thinking about you   where you are what youre doing  youre very persuasive then be persuaded  i only wish i could  not now if you dont want to  you take as long as you need   two years three  just so long as i know that youll marry me in the end  tony why on earth are you here did you leave something behind  no i had some business nearby so i thought id look in  are you staying er yes if if you dont mind  i brought a bag on the off chance and your man  i didnt want to make a fuss its only one night  i cant stay much longer nannys bringing down sybbie in a moment  it wont take long shes coming now  i see  what do you see  well i know now why you sent for me  youre going to gang up on me and try to pay me off  why would we pay you off  well if im pregnant  i want my baby to have a father and i wont change my mind about that  however much you offer  i wasnt planning to make an offer  because there is no child  what you cant know that  nobody can but i do know that actually  ednas not pregnant  do you think she would have let herself get pregnant before she was sure of you  and she knew how to prevent it  why else would you buy this book of instructions  marie stopes married love  though in your case it was unmarried love wasnt it dear  youve been through my things what if id agreed to marry her and there was no baby  once youd agreed she would have got pregnant  i dont know whom she would have selected as the father  but no doubt she had a candidate in mind  what proof have you got oh none at the moment  but if you persist in your lie  ill summon the doctor and have him examine you  you cant force me oh yes i can  ill lock you in this room and when hes arrived  ill tear off your clothes and hold you down if thats what it takes  you cant stop me from speaking to her ladyship  no youre right  that i cannot do  but if you want a reference  or another job during your natural lifetime youll hold your tongue  this is yours i think  but even with the book how did you know she wasnt pregnant  i didnt and the doctor couldnt have told a thing yet either  but at least we know the truth now  whats the matter with you never mind  i thought we were all about to be dancing to your tune  do you ever wonder why people dislike you so much  its because you are sly and oily and smug  and im really pleased i got the chance to tell you before i go  well if were playing the truth game  then youre a manipulative little witch  and if your schemes have come to nothing im delighted  are you leaving downton then whats it to you  oh plenty  its plenty to me  you wont believe whats happened  braithwaites handed in her notice what why  family troubles or so she says  are we living under a curse doomed to lose our ladys maids at regular intervals  anna did you know about this  is anything the matter  no mlord you seem very quiet lately  i hope bates is behaving himself  he never does anything else  will that be all mlady yes thank you  did they tell you tony gillinghams asked himself for the night they have  we must try not to read too much into it  why are you in your rompers  tony only brought black tie  he didnt think wed be changing if noone was staying  so another brick is pulled from the wall  why is lord gillingham back so soon  thats the big question but were very glad he is  not all of us i imagine  are you ready to go carson says the cars outside oh yes i think so  so youre off in the morning i am pity we didnt get edith to wait a day  why did she go to london anyway  i asked but she assumed an air of mystery  honestly papa ediths about as mysterious as a bucket  shes gone to see michael gregson  ooh thats the next thing to look forward to i dont dislike him  oh what a recommendation  goodnight dear goodnight granny  goodnight lord gillingham goodnight goodnight isobel goodnight  goodnight lord gillingham  i hope we see you up here again before too long i hope so too  that was nobly done mmhm  she is a good woman  and while the phrase is enough to set ones teeth on edge  there are moments when her virtue demands admiration  i agree although im rather surprised to hear you say it  not as surprised as i am  ah monks left the coffee  hes cleared off till the morning  does that mean we have to do the washing up no hell do that tomorrow  he comes back at eight thats quite a discipline  why do you say that  it reminds me of lady warwick  having the stable bell at easton rung at six  so everyone had to time to get to the right beds before the maids and valets arrived  isnt that apocryphal no actually  papa and mama stayed there once and said it was quite true  of course they already were in the right bed  i dont know why i said all that i hope i do  dont be silly  will you miss me of course  is it really only a week until you leave mm  is there anything i can do to keep things running whilst youre in munich  well as a matter of fact ive got something i want you to sign  it will give you some authority over my affairs  come here  whatll you do when you get there  well i thought id write a novel  or try to i always fancied myself a novelist and never had the time  now ive got nothing but  how long is it going to take im not sure  ill set the wheels in motion when i arrive  and well stop when and if we hit a rock  but the lawyers are quite optimistic  i thought lawyers were never optimistic  thats why its a good sign  are we going out tonight  rose was talking about the new band at the lotus club  hm well no i hadnt planned on going anywhere  no  no  michael i oh my darling  so i can move back in ednas room will be empty now  and if im to dress her ladyship and lady mary i think it makes sense  if thats what you really want  im sorry it didnt work out with miss braithwaite  not that i care much for her  im sorry about the disruption for her ladyship  one day ill tell you the whole story then youll be less sorry  the truth is we were mad as hatters to let her back in the house  ive got a present for you  its for your desk  what made you think of that  its good for you to be reminded you once had a heart  and itll reassure the staff to know you belong to the human race  this frame looks expensive  she was pretty though wasnt she  she was very pretty  and im sure she was very nice  and now you can look at that and remember her  youre right mrs hughes i will  the business of life is the acquisition of memories  in the end thats all there is  thank you  bates do you know anything about why braithwaite left  i dont mlord  they say she had some troubles at home  i hope its not too much for anna  bates  she wants to move back into the house mlord  she says she needs to if she is to perform her duties properly  is something wrong between you  yes  but i dont know what it is  she says its nothing ive done but i cant believe that  it must be my fault because she is incapable of fault  i dont know what to do  there is no such thing as a marriage between two intelligent people  that does not sometimes have to negotiate thin ice  i know  you must wait until things become clear  and they will  the damage cannot be irreparable  when a man and a woman love each other as much as you do  my goodness that was strong talk for an englishman  i dont really want to go back to london  but i suppose i have to hm  thats after i get your answer that is  i was wondering how long it would take you to get to the point  are you ready  what happens if i refuse  we both know i must marry  i dont need to explain to you how the system were trapped in works  please dont rush into anything  i wont make a fool of mabel it wouldnt be fair  id break up with her for you and i will credit her by saying that shed understand  she sounds rather fine  if you dont want me then  i think im honourbound to go through with it  its no good tony  i cant  im not free of him  yesterday you said i fill your brain  well matthew fills mine  still  and i dont want to be without him  not yet  can i ask one favour  and then i really will go and leave you in peace  what is it will you kiss me  please  i will never love again as i love you in this moment  and i must have something to remember  goodbye mary  my darling mary  my prayers go with you for everything that you do  may i have a word your lordship hm  if miss braithwaite is not coming back  i wondered if her replacement had been decided on not yet  i have a candidate id like to put forward who i know very well and is more than qualified  you must discuss it with her ladyship but ive no objection  shes a little older than miss braithwaite that wont hurt  why do you say that no reason  wheres tony has he gone he thought hed said all his goodbyes  and he wanted to catch the half past nine  are you ready where are you going  york for estimates to reequip the saw mill  so will we be seeing tony gillingham again  im sure we will eventually  he was telling me about mabel lane fox  apparently theyre getting engaged  i imagine hell be very taken up with that  yes i dare say  right ill get my hat  there you are  well you dont look too bad  i thought you might be a little the worse for wear  why should i be after only two hours sleep  my maid saw you come in arent you going to tell me what kept you out until six in the morning  well we  please dont say you were talking and you lost track of time  quite apart from the morality  or lack of it in this situation   you do realise you are taking a great risk  youre trusting this man with your name and your reputation  he wants to marry me of course i trust him  as you trusted sir anthony strallan  that was rather unkind  are you going to tell mama  no  youre a grown woman and im not a spy  but youre gambling with your future my dear  be under no illusions  a lot may be changing but some things will stay the same  im not a bit sorry no you dont look sorry  but you may find yourself feeling very sorry later  you seem more cheerful than you were in london i am  i took your advice i talked it over and im off the hook  so whatever it was its gone away  i think so  i envy you  why  because ive just done something which i have a sneaking fear i may regret  for a long time to come  my life is perfect and then in the space of one day it is nothing  good morning miss baxter hello mr bates  what do you make of her shes nice  how are you getting on with her ladyship that is so considerate  shell be eating out of your hand thats the intention  you owe your place to mrs crawley she would not let me go until id promised  you make me sound very fervent wars have been waged with less fervour  his forebears have been tenants since the reign of george iii  be that as it may the rents not been paid for ages  we gave your father a long time you want to farm the land yourself
