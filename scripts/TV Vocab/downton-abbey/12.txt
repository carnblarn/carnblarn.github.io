sorry  what happened i dont know i suddenly felt terribly cold  move i wont be sorry when this ones over  sir  mlady mlady wake up  what on earth youd better come downstairs  i didnt know what else to do when i saw the telegram  i knew it was urgent  so i hope it was right  quite right mrs crawley wont mind my opening it  the main thing is hes not dead  not yet anyway theyve patched him up  theyre bringing him to the hospital in downton  when do they think hell get here it doesnt say  how do we contact isobel how will she get back  one thing at a time ill ring the war office in the morning  maybe they know shes out there perhaps shes with him now  they wouldnt have sent a telegram here and shed have rung  no its the usual balls usual messup im afraid  beg pardon mlord but were all very anxious to know the news  yes of course  it appears that a few days ago captain crawley was wounded  its serious im afraid but hes alive  and on his way home to the hospital in the village  where theres life theres hope  what about william is he all right  ill find out what i can tomorrow  im not sure theres much more we can do tonight  williams father would have had a telegram if anything had happened  ill drive over in the morning  whatever you discover tell me  dont keep anything back  lady ediths back  william was caught in it  hes gone to some hospital in leeds  im very sorry  i might have known we couldnt be the only household left untouched  will he come through it her ladyship said it sounded bad  but we dont know more than that  can you walk with me to the church this afternoon if you want me to  because id like to say a prayer for them for both of them  we only cater for officers  dr clarkson i am no jacobin revolutionary  nor do i seek to overthrow the civilised world  we just need one bed for a young man from this village  and if it were within my power you should have it  sir you dont understand  williams father can not afford to leave his farm and move to leeds  im very sorry really but this is a military hospital  and its not up to me to challenge the order of things  ill nurse him im happy to do it it wouldnt add to your workload  if i were to break the rule for you how many others do you think  would come forward to plead for their sons  the answer is and must be no  it always happens when you give these little people power  it goes to their heads like strong drink  im sorry for him i am  i dont mind captain crawley hes a better man than most of them  and william too hes not a bad lad whatever you say  i wish id not written that letter to bates wife  telling her hes back here  whats that got to do with it what with everything else going on  i know shell come up here and make trouble  dont blame me it wasnt my idea  any news only that the doctor wont let william come to the village  he never its for officers only he says  and his poor father staying there with him  spending money hes not got and travelling miles to do it  its not right no it bloody well isnt  well im a working class lad and so is he  and i get fed up seeing how our lot always get shafted  i thought id take some things down to the hospital  then i can wait and sit with him when he arrives  ive read somewhere that its very important not to leave them alone  when theyre first wounded so no sign goes unnoticed  they cant spare a nurse to watch over every man  so thats what i can do  your mothers written to lavinia  good yes  im glad someones thought of that  she must stay here and not be at isobels by herself  what  nothing  you should have had a church wedding  dont be silly  no i mean it  you in a white dress me looking like a fool  id rather have the right man than the right wedding  well it wont be long now  how long  hard to say but dont worry  the decree nisi means were safe  the decree absolutes only a formality  im just sorry it cost so much  she couldve had my shoes and the shirt off my back  if it would only make her go away for good  shes gone now  i suppose i could feel guilty in my happiness  knowing the troubles theyre all facing back at home  but in another way it only makes me more grateful  lets pray lets pray together  dont worry the old ladyll sort something out  now shes got the bit between her teeth  im not worried not in that way i feel sorry for william thats all  well of course you do we all do  i expect youre glad now that you let him have his little daydream  no im not glad  i feel ive led him up the garden path with all that nonsense  and im ashamed  im so ashamed  shh  hello  mrs bates isnt it what do you want  dont sound inhospitable mrs patmore  when ive only ever known a welcome in this house  yes yes the minister  well how many marquesses of flintshire are there  yes oh  is this an instrument of communication or torture  what hello  shrimpie yes its aunt violet  yes very well very  ye and susan  ye good  good i wont beat about the bush dear  whom might we know on the board of leeds general infirmary  excuse me it is not settled it wasnt settled by me  that youd come back here and take up with your floozy again  as far as i recall that was never settled  how did you find out he was here wouldnt you like to know  what does it matter just say what you want spit it out  you thought youd got the better of me but you were wrong i never  im going to sell my story anyway  about lady mary about the turkish gentleman about miss smith here  its got nowt to do with me well thats not what i heard  you gave your word i gave you the money and you gave me your word  well guess what i was lying  if i hadnt come back to downton back to anna  would you have stuck to our agreement  well well never know now will we  youre angry because im happy  maybe  but you wont be happy long  can you drive me to the hospital  arent you needed here ive already taken lady mary down  i know i want to be with her when captain crawley arrives  they can manage without me here for a while  is she still in love with him i dont want to talk about it  why because im the chauffeur  no because shes my sister  youre good at hiding your feelings arent you all of you  much better than we are  perhaps but we do have feelings  and dont make the mistake of thinking we dont  and has lord flintshires order been acted on  it has theres an ambulance waiting  although noone quite knows how you managed it  what exactly is the matter with him  his body sustained too much damage he cannot recover  but he looks so normal  appearances can be cruelly deceptive  the force of the blast has fatally injured his lungs  but if hes lived this long  would it make any difference if he stayed here  or are you just making him as comfortable as can be  thats it theres nothing more we can do for him  so you agree with our plan  i dont know about you  but id rather die in a familiar place surrounded by familiar faces  there you are mr mason  seems we have everything settled and well be away before long  hell be forced to do better  if we can just get him back to where he knows i feel sure of it  i shouldnt  i shouldnt worry too much well know much more when hes rested  im very grateful mlady to both of you  lets get him ready  see sometimes we must let the blow fall by degrees  give him time to find the strength to face it  right theyre here  may i stay to settle him in very well  i want to help too  lady mary i appreciate your good intentions  but im concerned that captain crawleys condition  may be very distressing for you  might i suggest that you hang back  until the nurses have tidied him up a little  im not much good at hanging back im afraid  i wont get in your way i promise but i will stay  you have volunteers dont you well thats what i am a volunteer  all right  everyone to their posts  you stand there   yes this gentlemans second in  yes doctor  number two nurse crawley here  yes just here gently gently gently  take him under his feet  cousin matthew can you hear me  he is breathing but hes not been conscious since weve had him  they filled him full of morphine  thank you  what does it say  probable spinal damage  it could mean anything well know more in the morning  whats this doing here  i gave it to him for luck  he was probably carrying it when he fell  if only it had worked  hes alive isnt he  i should wash him this bit can be grim  sometimes we have to cut off the clothes theyve travelled in  and theres bound to be a lot of blood  how hot should the water be  warm more than hot and bring some towels  you should never have told her bates was here dont i know it  she was even worse after shed seen him than before  ranting on about a scandal that would bring the roof down  on the house of grantham silly mare  what scandal  i thought shed just come up and take a bite out of bates  thats what it sounded like  then you should have asked more questions  you know what they say  the devil is in the detail  well im not standing by while she brings misery and ruin on my lady  you started it  yes youre very important arent you very knowitall  with all of us at your beck and call  im sorry if youre angry but dont take it out on me  you did it  whom is she going to sell it to  she didnt say just that there was nothing we could do to stop her  mr bates has given her every last penny to keep her quiet  but shes tricked him and now hes got nothing left to bargain with  well we both know what i must do  but how can you ask sir richard for help without telling him the truth  id rather he heard it from my lips than read it over his breakfast  suppose he wont do anything  suppose he throws you over  thats a risk ill have to take  ill go up to london tomorrow afternoon  its a request that demands to be made in person  what about mr matthew  miss swire will be here to keep him company  i think i can take some time off to save my own neck  why dont you go home now mr mason and well see you tomorrow  are you sure you dont mind sitting up with him  he wont be alone not for a moment i promise  he looks so perfect lying there  but he does look perfect  are you sure theyve got it right  im afraid so if only i werent  can you feel that  mmm  what about that no  and that hmm no  nothing at all  do they know any more yet  theyre examining him now  so hes conscious just about  have they found out what happened  a shell landed near them  the explosion threw matthew against something  go on  dr clarkson thinks there may be trouble with his legs  not good news im afraid  id say the spinal cord has been transected  that it is permanently damaged  you mean he wont walk again  if im right then no he wont  its a shock of course and you must be allowed to grieve  i would only say that he will in all likelihood regain his health  this is not the end of his life  just the start of a different life  exactly  lord grantham i wonder if i might have a word  have you got a handkerchief  i never seem to have one in moments of crisis thank you  you mean there can be no children  no anything im afraid  but isnt there a chance that might change  the sexual reflex is controlled at a lower level of the spine  to the motor function of the legs  once the latter is cut off so is the former  right  give them a moment together  what was clarkson saying  nothing to worry you about  my darling  if he could only see the child  he wont ive written again and again  ive offered to bring him to any place he wants  i wasnt going to tell you this but hes coming on a visit this week  to see his old pals  help me mrs hughes let me come to downton and show him the baby  most certainly not i wont allow that  then ask him to meet me i know hed listen to you  ill give you a letter one more cant hurt  make him read it in front of you  ill ill do no such thing please  hed say it was none of my business and hed be right  besides dont think i approve of what youve done because i dont  havent you ever made a mistake  not on this scale no i have not sorry to disappoint you  so you wont do anything  im feeding you out of the house quite wrongly i might add  ive a good mind to stop that  now im the one whos sorry  now go in i dont know what to say  it doesnt matter hes dying  just say nice warm comforting things make him feel loved  you dont have to be shakespeare but  here she is come over here where i can see you  by eck it were worth it if i get to hold your hand  dont be daft  ive never slept in a room as big as this where are we  at the end of the south gallery now take this  any news of captain crawley  hes doing much better thanks to you  dadll be here in a minute can you stay for a minute  i ought to go down its not fair on mrs patmore  she wont mind  because  i did want to ask you something  daisy would you ever marry me now  and not wait for the end of the war like we said  you mustnt worry about all that for the moment now william  youre here for rest not excitement  thats right theres no need to worry about it now  first lets get you better but would you think about it  i must go theyll be sending out a search party soon just rest  it would be very unusual  i know that of course it would  but i believe i could make it work  and if your child were ill  my mother knows what shes doing shes brought up five of her own  even so and theyre only in the village  ill discuss it with mr carson  theres nothing wrong with your references  but of course they are from before you were married  im a good worker  and i must earn  matthew  are you feeling a bit less groggy  wheres lavinia  shes gone back to unpack  hows william  you know he tried to save me  he isnt too good im afraid  any sign of mother  not yet but im sure shes making her way back by now  ive still got this funny thing with my legs i cant seem to move them  or feel them now that i think about it  did clarkson mention what that might be  why dont we wait for lavinia and then we can all talk about it  tell me  youve not even been here for  nothing will have settled down yet  tell me  he says you may have damaged your spine  how long will it take to repair  we cant expect them to put timings on that sort of thing  but he did say it would get better  he said the first task is to rebuild your health  and thats what we have to concentrate on  i see  and he says there was no reason  why you should not have a perfectly full and normal life  just not a very mobile one  would you like some tea i would  thank you for telling me  i know im blubbing but i mean it id much rather know  thank you  blub all you like  and then when lavinias here you can make plans  major  might i have a word  what is it i have something for you  thank you  i wish you would read it  do you know who wrote it yes i do  and i know how anxious she is for an answer  with all due respect i dont believe its any of your concern  if youd only  if youd only see the child hes a lovely wee chap  mrs hughes the last thing i would wish to be is rude  but in this case i really must be left to my own devices  now ill say goodbye its time i was making tracks  goodbye then major  whod have thought it the cold and careful lady mary crawley  well we know better now  im surprised you havent given me some extenuating circumstances  i have none i was foolish and i was paid out for my folly  and when ive saved you if i can do you still expect me to marry you  knowing this  thats not for me to say  of course we both know that if we marry  people  your people  will think youve conferred a great blessing on me  my house will welcome the finest in the land  my children will carry noble blood in their veins  but that wont be the whole story will it not anymore  sir richard  if you think it pains me to ask this favour youd be right  but i have no choice if i am not to be an object of ridicule and pity  if you wish to break off our understanding  ill accept your decision  after all its never been announced  we may dissolve it with the minimum of discomfort  forgive me i dont mean to offend you  i am simply paying you the compliment of being honest  no in many ways if i can manage to bring it off  this will mean we come to the marriage  on slightly more equal terms  i think that pleases me  so youll do it ill try to do it yes  you must act fast  ill send a car for her as soon as youve left  please let me know what it costs  ill find a way to reimburse you  never mind that  as my future wife youre entitled to be in my debt  weve a bit of a conundrum my lord  as you may know were short of a housemaid  weve had an application from a local woman jane moorsum  but shes married and she has a child a son  but surely her husband she is a widow my lord  the late mr moorsum died on the somme  theres no other earner so she has to look for work  i said i would ask you  well if mrs hughes agrees  i think we must do what we can for the widows of our defenders  very good your lordship  what was that  were taking on a new maid he should have talked to me not you  they thought you were too busy to be bothered with it  well i am busy and that reminds me  i cant come with you to the townsends  youll have to make some excuse  but we gave them the date  youll think of something  you always said i wouldnt have to marry him when it came to it  daisy hes dying what difference does it make  all the more reason i cant lie to him at the end  dont make me be false to a dying man  what matters now is the poor lad knows some peace and some happiness  before he goes  i cant  i dont care if you cant walk you must think me very feeble  if you believe that would make a difference  i know it wouldnt  and i love you so much for saying it  but there is something else which may not have occurred to you  its just really difficult  we can never be properly married  what of course we can be married  not properly  i see  thats why i have to let you go  but that side of things its not important to me i promise  my darling its not important now  but it will be  and it should be  and i couldnt possibly be responsible  for stealing away the life you want to have  i wont leave you  i know you think im weak and i dont know what im taking on  how could you for gods sake  im not saying itll be easy for either of us  but just because a life isnt easy doesnt mean it isnt right  i wont fight with you  but i wont steal away your life  go home  think of me as dead  remember me as i was  marys telephoned shell be on a late train it gets in at 1100  all right  hows william  its so sad ediths taking care of him but theres nothing to be done  were waiting really  what is it  they shot the tsar and all of his family  how terrible  im sorry  ill not deny it  i never thought theyd do it  but sometimes the future needs terrible sacrifices  you thought that once  if you mean my politics  you know weve agreed to put that to one side until the war is won  your lot did but sylvia pankhurst was all for fighting on  dont badger me please  sometimes a hard sacrifice must be made  for a future thats worth having  thats all im saying  thats up to you  you understand it would have to be exclusive  i couldnt have you peddling  different versions of the story to my competitors  of course i understand but i cant help it  if they pick it up once youve published it  indeed you cant no more can i but i would control the timing  youd have to sign a binding contract to that effect today  i expected that  and i warn you i am unforgiving when anyone breaks a contract with me  one word out of place and youd find yourself in court  i expected that too  but im curious how did you hear about me  i know everything that goes on in this city  and whats the hurry  im a newspaper man when i hear of something good  i have to make sure of it straight away  im sorry if i rushed you  thats all right  you must dislike the crawleys very much  to want to subject them to trial by scandal  my husband works for them were not on good terms  how is he  his fathers with him now and he seems to understand the situation  poor man  daisy williams asking to see you  i cant go dont make me go  do you care so little for him  its not that im very fond of william and im very sad  but ive led him on and led him on  and made him think things that arent true  but he wanted them to be true he was happy to think they were true  but that doesnt make it all right  shall i tell him you wont come  will you leave us a moment dad  theres need to make him leave  there is a need come here  you know im dying  you dont im dying daisy  im not going to make it  and i dont have long  thats why youve got to marry me  what  no listen  youll be my widow  a war widow with a pension and rights  youll be looked after  it wont be much  but ill know  youve got something to fall back on  let me do that for you please  i cant  it would be dishonest  almost like cheating  but its not cheating we love each other dont we  wed have married if id got through it  and spent our whole lives together  wheres the dishonesty in that  hes asked you hasnt he  i knew he would  youll do it wont you  i dont think he should be bothering about it now  what else should he be bothered with  youre the most important thing on earth to him daisy  you wouldnt disappoint him would you  suppose the vicar wont do it  he may want to wait till williams well enough to go to church  but that times not coming is it  lavinia  youre back  how did you get on  all right i think  how about you  matthews told me to go home  he says he wont see me again  he feels he has to set me free as he put it  ive tried to tell him i dont care but he wont listen  then you must keep telling him  yes but you see it isnt just not walking  today he told me we could never be lovers  because all thats gone as well i didnt realise  its probably obvious to anyone with a brain but i didnt realise  no  no nor did i  and he feels it would be a crime to tie me down  to tie down any woman to the life of a childless nun  he thinks id hate him in the end  im sorry if ive shocked you but theres noone else  i could talk to about it and when you came in i  im not shocked  im just stunned  and desperately sad  ill die if i cant be with him  good god almighty  the engagement is announced between lady mary josephine crawley  eldest daughter of the earl and countess of grantham  and sir richard carlisle son of mr and the late mrs mark carlisle  of morningside edinburgh  is this why you went to see him  why didnt you say itd be in todays paper  i didnt know well surely he asked your permission  i dont think asking permission is his strongest suit  thats very highhanded  you cant let him get away with it  well its done now  what is it williams wedding my lord  if it can be arranged for this afternoon  the indoor staff would like to attend  we dont yet know if mr travis will agree to do it  im afraid he has very little time to make up his mind  this boy is in extremis  how can we know that these are his true wishes  maybe the kitchen maid somehow hopes to catch at an advantage  and what advantage would that be  some widows dole given by a grateful nation  mr travis can i remind you  william mason has served our family well  at the last he saved the life if not the health of my sons heir  now he wishes before he dies to marry his sweetheart  yes but you cannot imagine that we would allow you  to prevent this happening in case his widow claimed her dole  no but i have had an interest in this boy  i tried and failed to save him from conscription  but i will certainly attend his wedding  is that an argument in its favour  of course but  finally i would point out your living is in lord granthams gift  your house is on lord granthams land  and the very flowers in your church are from lord granthams garden  i hope it is not vulgar in me  to suggest that you find some way to overcome your scruples  but you cant have expected much more  not when those letters all went unanswered  i dont know what i expected but you cant help hoping  have you found any work  a bit of scrubbing  there arent many places i can take the baby  what do you tell them  that my husband died at the front  its funny  we have a new maid jane who really is a war widow with a child  and we respect her for it  but then we believe her story  mrs bates i really must insist  you tricked me well arent you going to deny it  certainly not i tricked you to protect my fiancees good name  thats one word for her i can think of a few others  youd better not speak them aloud if you know whats good for you  i dont want your money i dont want that contract  its too late for that  and i warn you if i so much as read her name  in anything but the court circular  i shall hound you and ruin you and have you locked up is that clear  it doesnt end here you know not for john bates  lady mary might have got away what do i care  but he wont  you tell him  thats entirely your own affair  where do we start  you tell me  your lordship ii do apologise  i thought mrs hughes said we were to clean in here  you must be the new maid  i am jane  and its very kind of you and her ladyship to take me on  not a bit we all owe your late husband a great debt  thank you  mlord theres a telephone call for  jane whatever are you doing  youre wanted in the drawing room not the library  to clean it while the men are out of it  shes very willing but shes not quite there yet i am sorry  dont be what about that call  for lady mary theyre waiting now  you might just catch her if you hurry  shes on her way to the hospital  his lordship asked mr bassett to bring these in for you  how lovely  here daisy sit down  i shouldnt be doing this its just a lie you know it is  youre doing it out of the goodness of your heart  the falseness of my heart more like  shes not quite the blooming bride  i dont think its the same when youre marrying a corpse  are you going  why not i wouldnt mind shaking williams hand before he goes  is that sentiment or superstition in case he haunts you  you look lovely dear  just to say the vicar is ready for us  lets go up then  dearly beloved we are gathered together here  in the sight of god and in the face of this congregation  to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony  which is an honourable estate  instituted of god in the time of mans innocency  signifying unto us the mystical union that is  if any man can show any just cause  why they may not lawfully be joined together  let them now speak or else hereafter forever hold his peace  have you the ring  i have a cold  you may now kiss the bride  shes better off in london  if you say so  do you know why i sent her away  i think so  then youll know i couldnt marry her  not now  i couldnt marry any woman  and if they should just want to be with you on any terms  noone sane would want to be with me as i am now  including me  god i think im going to be sick  its all right  its perfectly all right  what is it  i was just thinking it seems such a short time ago  since i turned you down and now look at me  an impotent cripple stinking of sick what a reversal  you have to admit its quite funny  all ill admit is that youre here and youve survived the war  thats enough for now  youre back hell be so pleased  youve become quite a nurse since i last saw you  no its nothing sybils the nurse in this family  its the very opposite of nothing  mother  bates whats happened hows william  hes nearly there mlady  i am so sorry  actually bates im glad ive caught you  sir richard carlisle telephoned me earlier  he says hes paid mrs bates for her story  she cannot speak of it now without risking prison  she wont do that  so i hope we can all forget it  its forgotten already mlady  thank you  im afraid she was very angry when she knew she had been silenced  i can imagine  he says she made threats against you  if i go down ill take him with me that sort of thing  im sure she didnt mean it are you mlady  well youd know better than i  lady marys back  ive just seen her she says its worked  sir richard has put a gag on vera  thank god so everything in our garden is rosy again  i hope so i certainly hope so  you must be so tired my lamb  why not let me take over for a while and go and lie down  no thank you mrs patmore ill stay with him  i wont leave him now not while he needs me  he doesnt need you no more daisy  he doesnt need none of us no more  dont tell me youll miss me i will mr carson very much  it means im not divorced after all  we will be together whether she wants it or not  sometimes cora you can be curiously unfeeling  ill wait forever im not asking for forever  i dont have to marry him you know  youve given me the power to destroy you and dont think i wont use it  how was it worse than you can possibly imagine  am i really a stranger do you not recognise me at all  if hes alive then i am no longer the future earl of grantham
