servant  any more our ears are ringing with it  trouble is im a little out of pocket at the moment  i cannot say that im sympathetic  when you dabble in the black market  i just need some more time mr carson  how long is it since the last patient left sergeant  youre trespassing on our generosity ill try to make myself useful  just find somewhere to go  yes  im here so i can see  its not such a good idea we mustnt worry granny  you asked me to come and ive come  would someone please tell me what is going on or  have we all stepped through the looking glass  your grandmother has as much right to know as anybody else  why dont i find that reassuring  how much longer is mr carson going to be its never worth  trying to make food interesting in the servants hall  youre very quiet this evening  ive had a letter off mr mason williams dad  yes what does he want  to see me youre his daughterinlaw why shouldnt he see you  i wish it were as simple i think it is but ill not reopen the wound  what do you mean you knew i hoped it would blow over  i didnt want to split the family when sybil  might still wake up youve driven me about  bowing and scraping and seducing my daughter behind my back  i dont bow and scrape and ive not seduced her  give your daughter some credit for knowing her own mind  how dare you use that tone  you will leave at once papa this is a folly  a ridiculous juvenile madness sybil what do you have in mind  mama this is hardly  no she must have something in mind  otherwise she wouldnt have summoned him here tonight  thank you granny yes we do have a plan  toms got a job on a paper  ill stay for the wedding i dont want to steal their thunder  but after that ill go to dublin  to live with him unmarried  ill live with his mother while the bands are red  and then well be married  and ill get a job as a nurse  what does your mother make of this  if you must know she thinks were very foolish  so at least we have something in common  i wont allow it i will not allow my daughter to throw away her life  you can posture all you like papa it wont  make any difference yes it will how  i dont want any money you can hardly lock me up until i die  ill say goodnight  but i can promise you one thing  tomorrow morning nothing will have changed  tom  hes not coming here  i dont want him to see this place  i wont have him pity me the question is are  you prepared to let them in to charlies life  i suppose so yes good  ill ask them to downton for monday at four  and this time itll be all above board  cant expect to live here free forever i didnt expect to get booted out  youll have to find some work  its not that easy every tom dick and harrys looking for work these days  and they all dont have a hand like a jules verne experiment  mr branson i know it wasnt easy last night  you should have spoken out long ago spoken out about what  why not  lady sybil and i are getting married  have you no shame  im sorry you feel like that mr carson youre a good man  but no i have no shame  in fact i have great pride in the love of that  young woman and i will strive to be worthy of it  i will not disgrace myself by discussing it nor will anyone else  now if you will go mr branson we will continue with our day  leave an address where we will forward what is owing to you no problem  ill be at the grantham arms until lady sybil is ready to make her departure  i bid you all a good day  is it really true please i have asked for silence  and silence i will have  what on earth is it a gramophone some cousins of mine have given it  you should stand well clear  when you light the blue touch paper  all on your own  ive left space at the front for jules  i know lavinias getting something from papa  and from me as shes so slight a real necklace would flatten her  what news of sybil papa is with her now  im afraid itll end in tears  maybe but they wont be sybils  i used to think that marys beau was a leonce but compared to this  hes practically a hapsburg  dont worry your turn will come  will it or am i just to be the maiden aunt  isnt this what they do arrange presents for their pretty relations  dont be defeatist dear its very middle class  id better go up and support your father  your threats are hollow dont you see  i wont be received in london i wont be welcome at court  how do i make you understand i couldnt care less  i do hope im interrupting something  i only wish you were i seem to be getting nowhere have you seen cora  shes lying down  and can we blame her  now sybil dear this sort of thing is all very well in novels but in reality  it can prove very uncomfortable  and while i am sure branson has many virtues  no no hes a good driver i will not give him up  dont be rude to your grandmother no shes not being rude just wrong  this is my offer  i will stay one week to avoid the impression ive run away  and because i dont want to spoil matthews wedding  then we will marry in dublin  and whoever wishes to visit is welcome out of the question  will you forbid mary and edith no no  dont say anything you may have to retract  know this there will be no more money  from here on in your life will be very different well  bully for that  i thought this might tide you over  whatevers the matter im sure ill be all  right if i can just stay still for a moment  you will not stay still not down here  get to bed this minute ill send for the doctor  i cant weve got the crawleys tonight and miss swire  what with this business of lady sybil ill deal with it  look get mr mosley to help theres no need i mean it  the war is no longer an excuse for sloppy presentation very well  ill ask him but only on condition you go to bed  are you too hot in that mlady you still have time to change  no thank you  so what do we do next god knows  this is what comes of spoiling her  the mad clothes the nursing  what were we thinking of thats not fair  shes a wonderful nurse whos worked very hard  and shes forgotten who she is  has she robert or have we overlooked who she really is  if youre turning american on me ill go downstairs  mr carson likes to serve two white wines which  you should open and decant just before they eat  a light one for the hors doeuvres a heavy one with the soup  keep that going for the fish then change to claret which you need to decant now  theres a pudding wine and after that whatever they want in  the drawing room with their coffee its a wonder they make it upstairs  they dont drink much of any of it  let me show you the decanters these four  so i dont have to receive that terrible man again  it wont be necessary  theyll meet her in here but should you be downstairs mlady  im perfectly all right thank you  why mosley i could have done it  but you always make a mountain out of not being a servant  im just trying to be helpful  im afraid being helpful is not something we associate you with  its wonderful what fear can do to the human spirit  you quite right mr mosley  yes i just want to be absolutely sure  that this is the lighter wine  what does it matter as long as its white no  i believe in starting the way you mean to go on  dont want to get off on the wrong foot  im glad youre here sybil  i was afraid youd have a tray in your room  maybe you should have done why  im not eloping like a thief in the night  i might have once but mary and edith talked me out of it  the plot thickens  after all sybils had time to think about it mother  it is not for us to have an opinion  mr mosley are you quite well  im all right thank you sir i dont believe you are  the awful truth is im not quite all right im afraid im going  to ask you to excuse me im so sorry  would you like us to call dr clarkson no its too late  hes coming for mr carson your

day  well tell noone but this you will do i cant  arent i as strong as lady sybil i dont doubt that  well then if she can do it so can we  thats what ive been thinking  i have stuck by you through thick and thin  thin and thin more like  mr bates if we have to face this then we will face it  as husband and wife and will not be moved to the sidelines  to watch from a distance with no right even

 youre ill and in all probability youll be a lot iller in the morning  how will you manage what about the wedding  im not sure therell be a wedding but i wont burden you with it  perhaps mr mosley could come on a permanent basis until im better  i doubt thats a solution mr carson  neither my patience or his liver could stand it  who is it  im sorry my lord we never settled a time  you wanted to be woken early i think  with everyone ill seven  ill breakfast at half past  very good my lord good night  this isnt fair  im placing you in an impossible situation  i want to be with you  let me  i

the way you are  thank you for that  i will cherish it  truly  what can i bring to help  ice to bring her temperature down mrs hughes  sir richard telephoned this morning hes coming down to help  can you have some rooms made ready for him and his valet  and tell mrs patmore very good mlady  i dont accept im ruining her life  nor cutting her off from her family you cut her off thats your decision  how will you look after her how can you hope to provide for her  you seem to think she can only be happy in some version of downton abbey  if she wanted that life she would not be marrying me  very well  id hoped to avoid this but i see that i cant  how much will you take to leave us in peace  what you must have doubts  you said your own mother thinks youre foolish yes she does  yield to those doubts and take enough to make a new life back in ireland  ill be generous if we can bring this nonsense to an end i see  you know your trouble my lord  youre like all of your kind you think you have the monopoly of honour  doesnt it occur to you that i believe the best  guarantee of sybils happiness lies with me  well if youre not prepared to listen to reason  im not prepared to listen to insults then ill bid you good day  and i want you to leave the village  even though shell come to me the moment i call  do you really want me to leave now when i will take her with me that same hour  there you are dr clarksons here  coras not at all well sybil and edith are with her  marys gone to meet sir richard from the train whys he coming  he wants to be useful i dont see how my lord  were two more maids down i hope you forgive  some catch as catch can in the days ahead  which maids not jane no my lord not jane  thank you what are they doing  decorations for the wedding it still hasnt been cancelled  they have to prepare for it  if anna or jane appear tell them to come  and help me do the room for sir richard  i can help with the bedroom then ill sort out a room for his man  and serve at dinner i cant pay you call it rent  the awful truth is the wedding simply cannot go ahead  dont say that i must  dr clarkson says youll be groggy for at least a week maybe longer  we have to face the facts what about my father  matthew can telephone him he cant come here while everyones ill  he has a weak chest we mustnt take the risk all right  i suppose weve made a decision then to delay  i dont think weve got any choice no im afraid we dont  at least she doesnt seem too serious no no  id say shes been lucky i am terribly sorry about the wedding  these things are sent to try us  why didnt anyone tell me she was like this  she took a turn for the worse half an hour ago  where were you out i went for a walk  there we are mlady thats better isnt it  shes been with her all night  obrien you must have a rest not just now my lord  i want to see her through the worst if i can  ill just make this cooler for you  how is she really tell me the truth  i cant yet dr clarkson says we will know more in a few hours  god almighty how can this be  my whole life gone over a cliff in the course of a single day  take care of that thank you  how are you doing im not sure  her ladyships worse im sorry  jane said you wanted to see me ive done it ive booked the registrar   when for  hes had a cancellation   so its friday afternoon  this friday  ethel what are you doing here the bryants have turned up aga  thats what  ill find mrs hughes and come back for you  i hope i havent kept you waiting no no  we have illness in the house so i hope youll excuse lord and lady grantham  its not them weve come to see is it is she here  shes just coming now  may i meet him properly  come along charlie  this nice lady is your grandmother  perhaps you could call me gran  hes a stout little chap isnt he  and so like charles i thought it when we were last here  i know what was said at the time and mr bryants sorry for it now  but i could see he was just like charles  never mind all that lets get down to business business  thats what you want from us isnt it  find out what me mean to do for little charlie in the future  what do you mean she might die what do you think  happens with a fatal illness the fairies come  if anything happens to her it wont be your fault miss obrien  ive never seen such care  i wish i could talk to her thats all but she doesnt know me  im sure she knows how hard youve worked for her its not that  theres something i nee  never mind  either i will or i wont  you never know people do you you can work with  them for 20 years you dont know them at all  what you mean give him up  never see him again those are my terms  but would it hurt if ethel were to care for him in your own house  she could be his nurse that might be possible  of course she cant be his nurse we need to bring him up as a gentleman  send him to harrow and oxford and all the  while his mothers in the servants hall  how does that work i could   no we want to raise his as our grandson  not as a housemaids bastard well he has to know the truth sometime  maybe but not for a long time  till then his father had a wartime marriage until  he died and his mother succumbed to spanish flu  a lot of people have weve quite a few upstairs  and that for many years at least is all that charlie will be told  so im just to be written out  painted over buried what matters is whats  good for charlie and whats good for you  youve got a heart i know you have you see what hes asking  ethel consider this in the world as it is compare the two futures  the first as my heir educated privileged rich  able to do what he wants marry whom he likes  the second as the bastard son   i think weve heard enough of that word for one day very well  as the nameless offshoot of a drudge  youre his mother  which would you choose for him  suppose i could be his nurse and never tell him who i am i promise that  surely  come on we all know thats a promise you could never keep  im sorry mrs hughes we need the  doctor at once her ladyships much worse  im afraid  go where youre needed weve had our say  you know how to reach us when youve made your decision  come along daphne  obrien  is that you obrien  yes mlady its me mlady  youre so good to me  youve always been so good  not always mlady so good  no  and the fact is i want to ask so much for your forgiveness  because i did something once which i bitterly regret bitterly  and if you could only know how much  so very good  how is she she slept and she seemed better  then suddenly the fever came back  obrien thank you for the way youve looked after her i mean it  im very grateful whatever comes  what a marathon but i think i got them all  everyone sends love i told your father ill telegraph him  as soon as its safe for him to come but not before  well i dont think i should leave you alone  but if you dont tell  ive been thinking about the date for the rematch and  what is it  i wonder if we havent been rather lucky  why i think weve both been very lucky  that weve been given a second chance a second chance at what  to be quite quite sure about what were doing  darling what can you mean the thing is   i might as well say it  when i came downstairs and you and mary were dancing   i heard what you said  and i saw what you did that was  no im not in a rage in a fury  in fact i think its noble of you to want  to keep your word when things have changed  but im not sure it would be right for me to hold you to it  lavinia i can explain no listen  ive had lots of time to think about it  i love you very very much  and ive wanted to marry you from the  first moment i saw you all that is true  but i didnt really know what i was taking on  its not in me to be queen of the county  im a little person an ordinary person  and when i saw you and mary together i thought  how fine how right you looked together  i dont want to hear this you must  because it isnt a sudden thing  i was starting to worry and then when you were wounded  i thought it was my calling to look after you  and care for you  and i dont think mary would have done  that quite as well as me really no no  not nearly as well  i do have some self worth  just not enough to make you marry the wrong person  this is pointless mary is marrying somebody else  is she  well see  i wont let you do this you will  we wont fight about it now  in fact im tired can i rest for a bit  well talk later of course  its good of you to come but i dont really see what you can do  i thought id better do my bit  the chauffers gone so i could drive the car  preferably over the chauffer  fathers not having an easy time of it  hows lady grantham not well  clarksons with her now  and miss swire shes  is that why youve come because i said lavinia had been taken ill  i was coming up anyway in a day or two for the wedding  well she wont be getting married on saturday  which i suppose is what youd like best  but shes not seriously ill  i see what was worrying you  if lavinia had been carried off you wanted to be  here to stop matthew from falling into my arms  on a tidal wave of grief its a tricky disease  his lordships asking for you mlady  i think we should aim at a sort of buffet dinner  then they can run in and out as it suits them  sorry to make extra work  never mind its hours like these we must all pull together  this arrived in the post daisy   tea for sir richard in the drawing room   im glad to know hes here to help  i can do it youre very obliging thomas  i can take some up to mr carson if youd like  is that from your mr mason hes not mine  what does he say he just says again we should talk about william  he wants me to go to his farm poor man  will you not visit him im not going to any farm  youre all hes got daisy  well then hes got nobody cos he hasnt got me  im sorry mlady i didnt think youd want to change tonight  i dont i just need a handkerchief  hows her ladyship not good im afraid  what is it i dont mean to bother you mlady  go on can you keep a secret  well i know you can  you see mr bates and i had a plan  to get married this coming friday what  hes worried the police havent finished with him and if hes right  then im not going through it with no  proper place in his life a brave decision  or a stupid one anyway with her ladyship ill now  and half the servants on their backs and everybody working   where is the marriage to be  just in a register office in ripon  it wouldnt take long but go ill cover for you were all here  you wont help mama by changing your plans  you better come shes worse  ive given her the epinephrine doctor no  what does that mean  its a hemorrhage of the mucus membranes  its not unusual  its all right mlady dont worry everythings going to be all right  everything is clearly not all right how bad is it  if she lasts through the night shell life  what about the others  come with me  ill be back shortly  ive given some medicine to mrs hughes  shell bring it up later i gather her ladyship is not improving  well er well know more tomorrow and miss swire  not too bad i think ill go to her when ive  seem the rest of the servants  thank you sir here we are mr carson  now have you got everything you need  mlady  i want to thank you for coming up mlady not at all  i mean it i know ive been a disappointment to you  maybe  but ive relied on your support for too long to do without it entirely  youll always have my support mlady and you mine  on which subject  i should be careful of thomas  i dont know how were to get rid of him after all this  i doubt hell want to stay a footman forever so watch out  you look very smart thomas i still have the shirt mlady  and i found my livery in the cupboard so i thought why not  i have a place for you here  hows lavinia all right i think  the illness has made her rather confused what do you mean  matthew mary  is it mama  thats whats so its lavinia  let him go to her let him be with her surely you owe her that  what happened this is how i found her  its bad im afraid  very bad  the worst i dont understand when i was with her she was fine  its a strange disease with sudden savage changes  im terribly sorry what

troubles  mr bates  weve waited long enough to be together you and i  and now that were man and wife  can that not be enough just for this one night  earth to earth  ashes to ashes  dust to dust  in

whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself  amen  amen  would you give him a moment of course maam i understand  we better get moving if were to be back before they arrive  mrs patmore and

as when young folks die  nay neednt hide your tears from me love  it does me good to see how much you loved him it does  you must tell me if theres anything i can do  anything at all thank you  but i dont think so  that night when we were dancing  lavinia came downstairs  she heard she  she saw everything  how terrible for her  im so sorry because of what she saw  she thought we should cancel the wedding  that i belonged with you  not with her  she gave up because of us she said tome when she was dying  isnt this better  i know its a cliche but  i believe she died of a broken heart because of that kiss  we were the ones who killed her  matthew i could never be happy now dont you see  were cursed you and i  and theres nothing to be done about it  lets be strong mary  lets accept that this is the end  of course its the end  how could it not be  im so very sorry about this  thank you  can i walk you up to the house or certainly you can  i want you to  so sad  why are you here to pay my respects to miss swire and to see sybil  lady sybil papa whats the point in all that nonsense  i suppose youll go to dublin now isnt that your plan in a day or two  mama is well again and i see no reason to delay  although i do so wish we could have parted friends  what about you do you want to part friends  i do although i dont expect to  all right  what  well if i cant stop you i see no profit in a quarrel  youll have a very different life from the one you might have lived  but if youre sure its what you want  i am  then you may take my blessing with you whatever that means  papa it means more than anything more than anything  if you mistreat her i will personally have you torn to pieces by wild dogs  id expect no less  will you come over for the wedding well talk about that later  and therell be some money but not much  so youve given in  she would have gone anyway  and perhaps we should let lavinias last gift to us  be a reminder of what really matters  youll think thats soft not at all  the aristocracy has not survived by its intransigence  no we must work with what weve got to minimise the scandal  but what have we got to work with  youd be surprised hes political isnt he  and a writer  i could make something out of that  and theres a family called branson  with a place not far from cork  i believe they have a connection with the howards  surely we can hitch him onto them  mr bates you all right mrs patmore im all right  there are two men waiting for you in the servants hall  are you looking for me john bates  yes you are under arrest on the charge of willful murder  you are not obliged to say anything unless you desire to do so  whatever you say will be taken down in writing and  may be given in evidence against you upon trial  i understand  no no please  do whatever is required  i love you and i love you  for richer for poorer for better for worse come along sir
