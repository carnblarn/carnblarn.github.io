                i dont know why you always wait for me theres no need  i want to be the first to greet you every day  well as i saidtheres no need  theres   theres every need  and i will keep it up until you explain to me what has gone wrong between us explain what  my life is perfect  and then in the space of one day it is nothing  to me that requires an explanation  oh good morning miss baxter hello mr bates mrs bates  i wondered if youd help me we will if we can  its my sewing machine i have no sockets in my room  and as the sewing room is in the laundry wing  i wondered if mrs hughes might let me use it in the servants hall  i should ask her if i were you yes of course  ill do that  what do you make of her  shes nice which prompts me to wonder what she sees in our friend thomas  you know the old saying  theres nowt so queer as folk  well miss breakfast if were not careful  are you happy for us to be teaching alfred to cook  its mr carson you should ask  ask me what about the kitchen staff  helping alfred to train for his test  hes been accepted for it then not yet no  but hed like to be ready if he is i suppose its all right  alfred is a hard worker ill give him that  and if cookings his chosen path  good i was just checking i wasnt inciting a revolution  there we aremy lady  i think ive remembered everything but  ill just stay here while you check  it seems perfect but whats this  well i know americans often drink orange juice with breakfast  so i thought you might like it  that is so considerate baxter  thank you  good morning my lord good morning  you look very jovial  its just baxter reminding me of times gone by  youre pleased with her i am thank heaven  whats your day looking like tom and mary have summoned me to the library  they have an idea i hope its not something youre going to fight about  how can i answer that when i dont know what it is  so if we find a job for the boy itll make a difference to his mother  oh a big difference if you really want to help mrs pegg  this will be of more use than a world of tea and sympathy  well i dont need anyone else here i know  but would you talk to the head gardener up at the abbey  or maybe even talk to lady grantham she takes her garden seriously  you dont have to tell me that  im sorry whens the funeral  tomorrow will you go  i will his forebears have been tenants since the reign of george iii  be that as it may the rents not been paid for ages  weve served all the papers its time to get on with it  you mean foreclose the lease and farm the land ourselves  thats what we discussed  its sad though  after such a long time in the hands of one family  the world moves on and we must move with it so you keep telling me  talking of the world moving on i suppose youve seen this  the engagement is announced between the viscount gillingham  and the honourable mabel lane fox  only child of the late lord osweston  well i must write and congratulate him  nowlet me get on  but its electric arent you worried itll run away with itself  and sew your fingers to the table  i certainly hope not how do you operate it  with a pedal  under my foot well i dont think it has any business in a servants hall  but theres no socket in her room she could take it to the laundry  or better still chuck it out altogether  mrs patmore is not what youd call a futurist   i think id got there already   anna ive forgotten something  you must forgive me mr bates im afraid im keeping anna too busy  would you like to have a try  anna  i dont know why you must be so hard on mr bates  at least you know now therell be no baby  no  then cant you start to get past it and  and tell him something  hed know if it wasnt the truth  he sees through me he can read me like a book  i wish he could read you  and take you out of this veil of shadows  dont you want to be honest with him  of course i do  but i know him i know what hed do  and i cant risk his future  wellits your secret and not mine  but i think its a mistake  and youre sure you have a feel for gardening  i am your ladyship im not a ladyship just mrs crawley  ii dont know much now but im a grafter  and a quick learner  i cannot make promises but i will try and find something for you  thank you very much your ladyship  will you show him out  hes going to be so disappointed when he finds out how ordinary i really am  youre part of the family thats how the village sees you  its not how the family see me  oh im not so sure about that  lord and lady grantham have always been as kind as they can be  and i appreciate it but i am not one of them and thats the end of it  lord grantham admires you very much  but if it serves you to think yourself unloved nothing i say will change that  i think thats rather harsh  lord grantham it was a very good service your father wouldve been pleased  thank you  do you have far to go im staying at yew tree farm  of course  let us know when youre ready to leave theres no hurry  the thing is my lord idont want to move out  i want to take on the tenancy  what if its still possible  im sorry to be the one to say it but i dont believe it is  the notices have been served the case is closed  you mean you want to farm the land yourself  then its all settled  mr drewe its no good painting me as simon legree  we gave your father a long time to get straight  and left him in peace at the end of his life  he never told me about the debt  or idve tried to help him  because my ancestors have farmed at yew tree since the napoleonic wars  surely thats got to mean something  it means a great deal to me  then can we talk about it my lord  please  come tomorrow morning if you wish  but i cant see what good it will do  dont take it off too soon let it bubble a bit or youll taste the flour  sois this enough id say so yeah  now put it to one side while you check your casings  my my something smells good alfreds making tarts with an egg and cheese filling oh  bouchees de fromage they could be tonights savoury  do you think i dont see why not ill fetch the eggs  well done daisy its very hard mrs patmore  i feel like im helping him to leave us and so you are  which is as it should be now hes decided to go  so whats next well add egg and cheese to the white sauce if mrs patmore doesnt mind  i dont mind at all daisy you can help him enrich the bechamel  your ladyship my lady  is that the afternoon post is there anything for me  theres just a couple for his lordship my lady  were you expecting something  not particularly  i havent heard from michael in a bit thats all  i expect hes busy  what have you been up to  i was writing to tony gillingham  give him my regards  say we look forward to knowing miss lane fox  i am surprised i thought he was rather keen on you  not for the first time youve got the wrong end of the stick  oh i thought you were robert  is he back from his funeral not yet i dont think  while hes not here shall we discuss his birthday  oh does he have a birthday soon fairly soon  do you have any plans  nothing beyond his favourite food  its not a special one why dont we have a party  to cheer ourselves up a small one thatll be fun  but maley may have a candidate of his own that he wants to bring forward  so you do need extra help  i suppose so  the last boy went off to a frightfully grand rectory  then will you take young pegg  he impressed me so favourably  you know i wonder your halo doesnt grow heavy  it must be like wearing a tiara round the clock  will you help him his mother would be very grateful  and so would i yes but your gratitude never seems to last  ive no sooner said yes than you come back with another request  will you  very well very well  but hed better turn out to be all the things you say he is  thought id get an extra  you can help me with this  sybbie says theres going to be a hurricane any moment now  a hurricane really in yorkshire  so were getting all the animals under shelter  im sure you are wheres nanny

plate  havent we all  oh bravo very good  shes right i couldnt have done better myself  now take them up and say you cooked em  i couldnt well mr carson can say it  and what are they supposed to do hang out the flags  oh dont grudge him his success i dont  i just cant see the fun in a life chained to a stove  are the savouries ready to go up  they certainly are  i say well done well be sorry to lose you alfred  but i think youll pass your test fingers crossed my lady  when is it the day after tomorrow im going up in the morning  our best wishes go with you  im going up myself tomorrow oh  just for the day to visit michaels office  ill be back for dinner  all alone i seem to be  i dont know why  how are you getting on with her ladyship  pretty welli think  youve done america and praised lady sybil have i not   you name it ive said it  shell be eating out of your hand thats the intention  no enemies downstairs neither  that was miss obriens mistake  nobody liked her so nobody told her anything  they dont like you much thats why youre here  to rectify that failing on my part  is it true youve moved into the house again  mrs hughes said so it seemed easier when i was looking after her ladyship as well as you  but she has her own maid now  why not go back to the cottage  i havent got round to it  anna if youre in difficulties i wish youd tell me  im not my lady honestly  ive come to say goodbye thank you for all your help  just keep calm you know enough to do well if you keep calm  very good luck alfred is there anything i ought to know about london  theres quite a lot you ought to know about london dear  and no time to tell it now or hell miss his train  this afternoon when her ladyship comes down  i dont want any backchat  she must see everything is in order all neat and tidy  whats happened to your apron  why what should   oh my god whats up  welli mustve caught it on a nail  my others in the wash and her ladyships due  oh dont worry miss baxterll sort that out give it here right  i thought you wouldnt mind if alfred rode in the front my lady  hes catching the same train of course i dont mind  we all wish you luck alfred im going to need it my lady  its his first trip to london how exciting  excitings one word for it  you want to reverse the foreclosure and take the lease  but you still cant pay all the arrears  it doesnt seem a very enticing offer  ill pay and it wont take long  even so  im a yorkshireman my lord  this is where i belong  weve worked this land in partnership with the crawleys  for more than a century  in partnership with the crawleys  i dont mean to be impertinent i do not hear it as impertinence  we have been in partnership  were in partnership with all our tenants or we should be  then will you let me come home  ill see what i can do  thank you my lord  ill be at the farm  mr drewe  i would prefer to report that you are prepared to repay the arrears in full  ill lend you the difference myself  youd do that for me  it wont be less than 50 ill send a cheque when im sure of the outcome  you wont regret it no  i dont think i will  do you think alfred has a chance with his cooking  i think hes got more than a chance  judging by what mrs patmore has to say on the subject  because ive got an idea that might kill two birds with one stone  well be short of a footman any day and mr molesley will be short of a job  what say we deal with the two problems together  and solve both exactly   but would he do it  would he do it   when hes been mending roads and delivering groceries  and lucky to get even that ill say hell do it  i hope youre right i know i am  you mightve talked it over with us before you made up your mind  but i havent i told him wed think about it thats all  sounds to me as if youve come to a decision  if we dont respect the past itll be harder to build our future  where did you read that i made it up  i thought it was rather good its too good  one thing we dont want is a poet in the family   would it be so bad  the only poet peer i am familiar with is lord byron  and i presume you all know how that ended  so youd let mr drewe stay on since he wants to repay the debt i think it only fair  besides he talks of the partnership between the farmers and the family and i like that  well i think its splendid says the queen of the rebels   thank you and you agree even though he has no right to renew the lease  no right legally no but we think he has a moral right  its a pity it should be yew tree it wouldve filled a hole in the land we farm  youve managed without it till now you havent said what you think  which side are you on the farmers of course  ive not abandoned all my socialism even though it feels like it sometimes  in this one and only instance i am glad to hear it  when will you tell him theres no tearing rush  weve a day or two to talk it over and then you can tell him  its strangestanding here next to you in silence  because i love you  i want to find out why you dont love me any more  youd think we could talk about it but apparently not  but i dont  im going into ripon this afternoon to get some things for lady mary  if they miss me ill be back before the gong  well  at least i know youll be back before the gong   ooh i cant get over the speed of it  i feel quite dizzy watching  i dont think itll show  show its better than it was before i bought it  aw thanks very much  her ladyships on her way down  another one roped to the chariot   im grateful for this job thomas  and we both know why but whats it all about  well theres going to be changes at downton theres bound to be  im sure  so i want to know about any plans upstairs  any detail no matter how small understand  did the other ladys maids keep you informed  miss obrien yes but we fell out  what about mrs bates is she an enemy  she knows whats going on  no shes not an enemy but shes incorruptible  so we have nothing in common  shes also silent shouldnt think ive had four words out of her since i arrived  just get them all to trust you and tell you everything  your ladyship how can i help  ive come down to persuade you i just dont see why its better than an ice box  well a refrigerator is more efficient  it keeps food fresh longer  we wont need ice to be delivered  but the papers will still be delivered and the groceries and all sorts  or are we to stop that too  mrs patmore  is there any aspect of the present day that you can accept without resistance  well my lady  i wouldnt mind getting rid of my corset  you must do everything maley tells you  i will your ladyship john is keen to learn arent you  i am maam because theres always work for a good gardener  you owe your place to mrs crawley she would not let me go until id promised  she would not relax her grip  you make me sound very fervent  wars have been waged with less fervour   well lets hope we win this one good day john  say what you like but i know you care about these things as much as i do  nobody cares about anything as much as you do  this is it  my name is arsene avignon i am the sous chef of the ritz  todayyou are going to make four dishes  is that clear then if you have no questions we will begin  in 1917 at our sister hotel in new york  the chef monsieur diat altered a soup made popular by monsieur gouffe and  the great monsieur escoffier  what did he do  he served it cold very good yes it was eaten cold  previously the name had been a simple one  leek and potato soup but  what was it called now  vichyssoise it was vichyssoise  soyou all have the instructions before you  please begin  mr napier  what  hello mary  i can still call you mary  of course you can how lovely  what brings you here  im working on a government thing and weve got some research to do in yorkshire  im on a sort of reconnoitring expedition  lucky me i was in thirsk and i suddenly thought why not take a chance  well im so glad you did  let me give you some tea  ill get them to tell mama and papa that youre here  while ive got you alone  youve been in my thoughts a great deal  since the wholeghastly business  thats nice to know which is why its lovely to see you looking so um  lovely  hello lady mary wants tea for four  illstart again hello lady mary wants tea for four in the library  its not right you know when you speak against alfred  sorry but imagine having never been to london  dearie me ive not been to london  and for me it just goes to show  he may be nervous it may be a daunting prospect but hes got ambition  it drives him and i admire that  good  because ive got plenty of ambition where youre concerned  dont be so soft  sowhat is this thing youre working on  its all to do with the rural economy very hushhush  well dont tell us if its meant to be a secret  well itsnot like that  a lot of landed estates are in difficulty  the department wants to assess the damage of the war years  are they likely to survive and so on and are they  some of them it sounds rather interesting  it is interesting and incredibly depressing  which places are you studying in yorkshire  that i cannot say it wouldnt be fair on the owners  but we have earmarked the ones in serious trouble  and youll be glad to know downtons not among them  still wed love your opinion on whether or not were doing the right things wouldnt we papa  we dont want to add to his labours  where are you staying while youre up here  we havent decided theres quite a good hotel in ripon  nonsense you must stay with us i couldnt possibly  why not  well to start with ill have my boss with me whos that  charles blake have you ever come across him  i dont think so you must both stay here  that way well get the benefit of all your knowledge for the price of a couple of dinners  what could be better than that  well mr nugent youve donequite well  i know i can do better sir if you give me a chance i know it  you havent chosen to make your living in the kitchen before now  no you see my mother was keen   you have worked instead as a footman for the earl of grantham  i have yes and this has made youunhappy  ill not say that  but i want to do more with my life  i see well we have difficult decisions ahead  but dont worry we wont keep you waiting  its good of youto let me disturb your afternoon  you see  i have to get to the bottom of whats troubling me  and i believe you can help  i doubt that the thing isi know you can  i heard you questioning anna about why she was being so hard on me  but that doesnt mean  yes it does  you know what this is about  and you believe she should have told me  well i admit  i think she should have  but it is not for me to  then i cant stay here what  i have been happy in this house  happier than i had any right to be  but that only makes my present situation all the harder to bear  i can imagine can you  can you mrs hughes because if you can  you will know why i have to leave here  my wife no longer loves me  the sight of me is torture for her which is torture for me  if you will not let me hear the truth  i will hand in my resignation now and be gone before she gets back  so be it  wait  where is anna shehad an errand in ripon  its not true anna loves you very very much  and i think the pain of coming home to find you gone would finish her  so i will tell you what happened to make you stay  and if im doing the wrong thing then i ask for the mercy of god  im sorry my lady they said you wouldnt be in here before seven  no nor would i be  but i left aletter on my desk  has anybody else  oh  has anybody else been in here  i dont know your ladyship  no  no why would you  thats all of it  you havent said whenit happened  havent i  was it the last night of the houseparty  when she told me  she faintedand hit her head  is that when it happened  yes then i know who it really was  ive told you who it was  but i dont believe you  i think it was lord gillinghams valet who teased her  and flirted with her from the moment he arrived  it was not lord gillinghams valet  i dont believe he ever left the concert it was not him  do you swear that why should i swear  you must swear it  on everything you hold dear  will you ive said  it was an outsider it was noone who was staying in the house  a man broke in and waited down here how many times must i repeat it  do you swear  very well if it makes you feel better i swear  on your mothers life she is dead on her grave  ive said i swear  because i will find out who he is  youre welcome to try  but i dont know what youve got to go on  ah there you are how did you get on  oh fine  i hear evelyn napier was here earlier im sorry to have missed him  yes he just dropped in it was a spur of the moment thing  is he still in pursuit of mary  i didnt ask him  so will you be giving a birthday party for robert  why do you really want me to  id had rather a good idea for it thats all  if i did would you give me a hand absolutely shh  so have we come to a final decision about drewe  i suppose so if it means that much to you  and toms socialism will ensure his approval of the plan  you laugh but as a matter of fact ive been thinking about it quite a lot lately  about what my beliefs i suppose im not too sure what they are any more  since the houseparty  i wont hear another word about the houseparty  somebody said something to upset you thats all it is what was this who was rude  noone hes got that wrong  i justfelt like an intruder  it made me face the fact that im living where i dont belong welcome to the club   oh stop moaning but if you went back to ireland tom would you belong there  no i dont think i would youve changed me too much  im a man without a home i am stateless  well then there is america  i have family there and theyre doing quite well  it would be a new start but youve made a new start here  but im talking about the world sybbie will grow up in  wouldnt it be easier for her to begin with a clean slate  rather than being the daughter of an uppity chauffeur  well dont do anything in a hurry  we dont want to lose you tom  what do you mean youll have to think about it  what i say i didnt mind helping you out when you were shortstaffed  how good of you  but to accept a permanent position as a footman  im a trained valet mr car im a trained butler  to acceptmy fall by taking a permanent inferior place  you keep telling me its permanent  but from where im sitting its looking less permanent by the minute  i shall give it every consideration  very generous i must say   ill let you know my answer when i have one  i shall wait with bated breath   arent you ever going to finish that  its nearly midnight  someone has to do it but it doesnt always have to be you  i know  i know what happened  mrs hughes told me i forced her to  then she was very wrong it wasnt her secret to tell  i gave her no choice anna  what did she say  how  how it happened  when it happened  i asked if it was green  who mr green  lord gillinghams valet she swore it wasnt  no it wasnt him she said a man  broke in and was waiting down here for you a stranger  thats right  because if it was the valet  he is a dead man  it wasnt him you only say that because you didnt like him  no i did not  theres no excuse to accuse him when he did nothing  would i have sat at breakfast with him next morning if itd been him  we cant know who the man was  we have no way of tracing him  why wouldnt you tell me  because i knew the suffering it would bring you  well its in the open  no more secrets  im glad of that at least  no more fear of being found out because i am found out  my shame has nowhere to hide  why do you talk of shame  i dont accept that there is any shame in this  but i am spoiled for you  and i can never be unspoiled  you are not spoiled  you are made  higher to me  and holier because of the suffering you have been put through  you are my wife  and i have never been prouder  nor loved you more than i love you now at this moment  truly  truly  morning  alfred  is that the result  i think so yes do you want me to open it  no ill do it myself good luck  well  ive not got it what  oh i am sorry it says i did well and i was nearly in the top four but not quite  i expect they say that to everyone thats enough james  and alfred  to fail at the first attempt does not mean that you wont succeed later  quite right might i have a word mr carson  certainly  ive given it a lot of thought  have you indeed  first  i needed to deal with my fathers disappointment  when he learned of my downward path  but i weighed it against the power to do good that all employment brings  did you now and you thought all that  i feel i could contain my skills and guide them  into amore modest channel without loss of dignity  just fancy  so all in all  and after mature deliberation youll be pleased to hear that i can accept your offer  what offer to replace alfred as footman  oh dear mr molesley im afraid that alfreds not leaving now  its a pity you didnt accept the job when we last talked  and then id have been stuck with you  as it is youve missed your chance  as i generally do  mature deliberation   cheer up lad  you read the letter  you were a very near miss so next time youll hit the target  i reckon jimmys right they say that to everyone who fails  well i reckon you work hard and you deserve to succeed  you just have to stick at it and you will  im not saying he took it  but i dont see who else couldve done  in other words youre saying he took it  i know he was in this room  legitimately really dr clarkson im not a witness for the prosecution  arent you well let us review the facts i have lost a valuable paper knife  given to the late lord grantham by the king of sweden  which makes all the difference   it makes the loss greater yes  i quite agree  but i cant accept theres any real proof against ermyoung pegg  well if you insist i wont sack him yet  but i will not allow him back in the house  and i will have to speak to my head gardener about it  that will do him a lot of harm well what would you prefer  that i invite the local criminals to drop in and strip the house bare  why not ask to be told when a gardener is coming inside  so that you or a servant can keep watch  then well have time to investigate the loss of the knife  or have you already scented blood as a matter of interest do you ever doubt  i dont doubt the honesty of young pegg  that is not at all what i asked  im very grateful my lady  you didnt have to do this but it determines me to prove im worthy of your faith  i cant pretend to take the credit mr drewe  it was his lordship who was determined you should stay  you owe your thanks to him  hell have my thanks my lady  and hell have the rest of the payment before hes missed it  what payment remainder of the debt  i thought youd know about it and so we do  of course we do im sorry i was being absentminded  how much is it ive forgotten  its only the last 50  he sent a cheque so i can pay off the full amount and wipe the slate clean  well thank you mr drewe im sure we have many fruitful years ahead of us  are you going to challenge him  no if papa believes enough in drewe to lend him the money  and to hide it from us then that tells me something  what exactly that you and i are in partnership with a very decent man  mrs hughes can i have a word  i know you told mr bates about me while i was out yesterday  he put me in a verydifficult  im afraid he guessed who it was  but you denied it denied it  i swore on my mothers grave it wasnt himgod help me  he seems to have accepted your word  in fact im moving back into the cottage  oh oh imim so pleased  at least if im damned for all eternity it was to some purpose  you wont be damned  mr bates has shown great generosity of spirit  as i knew he would eventually  sowere going to try and put the whole thing behind us  i hate to think of that evil man getting away scot free  but maybe its for the best  i thought youd like to know  what are you grinning about what do you think hes not going  mr bates im so glad to see you  annas told me whats gone on between you  and its made me happier than i can say  to think its all over and done with  nothings over and done with mrs hughes  but anna said  do you think i would add to her burden after all shes been through  i dont know his name so i cant tell it to you  not if you were to threaten me with a knife mr bates  i understand and i wont press you  but be aware  nothing is over  and nothing is done with  michaels vanished into thin air if anything had happened wed know  i was a fool to think we could leave it behind im the failure here not you  can i interrupt  mr napier and mr blake are here in a few days  youre here to advise the landowners on how to get through this crisis arent you not quite  you seem to have brought a traitor into our midst  not a traitor i wonder you dont just set fire to the abbey and dance round it  painted with woad and howling  i might if it would do any good  this came in the evening post is anything the matter
