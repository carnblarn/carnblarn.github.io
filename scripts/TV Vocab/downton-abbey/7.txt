                downton abbey  season 1 episode 7  hurry up girls come on  come on come on you should be done here  theyll be back from the station any second now  i havent had a chance to ask how was london  oh much as usual dirty noisy quite enjoyable  there was no need for you to come back a day early  im perfectly capable of getting the house ready  of course you are but id like to have the heavy luggage back and unpacked before they get here  i suppose steady william  this isnt a race   poor lad  but he did see her  i was worried when i took him to kings cross  yes he had time to say goodbye  how is he now  well youve only got one mother havent you  theyre here mrs hughes  hello william its good to have you back  what a relief to be home  dont listen when his lordship pretends not to enjoy the season   when in rome  will lady mary be back soon  shes staying on with my sister for a couple of weeks  so grantham house is closed  it will be by the end of this week  dear mrs hughes i hope youve had some time to yourself while weve been away  ive tackled a few jobs that get forgotten when the house is full  any local news  the main topic here is the murder of the austrian archduke  yeah here and everywhere else  im afraid we havent heard the last of that   hows william  bearing up  poor chap he has our sympathies   i think ill wash the train off before dinner  very good my lord   i can unpack while youre bathing  ill see you up there  mrs hughes have you thought about the garden party for the hospital  ive started on it but there are things we need to talk about  oh dear that sounds like trouble ill take my hat off  sybil you were a great success in london darling well done   you never say that to me  dont i  you were very helpful dear thank you  i hate to spoil her ladyships homecoming  but what are we going to do about mrs patmore  shes worse than when you left much worse  and i meant to ask  is there a decision about mr bates leaving  not yet  his lordship wants the facts and mr bates wont give them  so what are you going to say to her ladyship about mrs patmore  oh im not sure  i dont want the poor woman sacked  but things cannot go on as they are  theres nothing like an english summer is there  except an english winter  im sorry you havent received more invitations  but then after four seasons one is less a debutante than a survivor  my dear is there anything youre not telling me   no  only one hears stories  theres nothing aunt rosamund  so have you decided  whether or not to marry cousin matthew  oh theres no secret cora can keep for more than a month  youd be surprised  ive told him ill give him my answer the day i get back  well it would be very tidy at least we can say that   fancy a smoke  dont mind if i do  there they go guy fawkes and his assistant   which is which  here you are  surely if his lordship hasnt done anything until now  it means he doesnt want to take it any further  annas made me an armband mr carson  for my mother can i wear it  i daresay not when were entertaining  but otherwise  hello doctor i didnt know you were here  no lady grantham sent a message   why shes not ill is she  not ill exactly  would you mind waiting in the library   pregnant  you neednt be quite so shocked  give me a moment  you havent been pregnant for 18 years   and im pregnant now  i dont understand what weve done differently  stop right there if you want to know more go and offer the doctor some whisky  i cant take it in  but youre pleased  of course of course im pleased  i didnt think shed do it  i told you she would  i could see she was interested  now i was speaking as one ladys maid to another that means something  course we thought we had him before but hes a slippery devil  its unusual obviously  unusual its biblical  not quite  you understand that women go through a certain change  thank you i know quite as much as i need to about all that  well sometimes it can result in a  a surge of fertility for want of a better word   but the child will be healthy  theres no reason why not  how long has she  hard to be precise things had become irregular but   please  id say shes about four months gone  itll begin to show soon  and i dont suppose theres any way of knowing if its a  i do beg your pardon my lord i thought you were alone  please come in mrs hughes  im just leaving   william  well thank you doctor   id better start writing some letters  show dr clarkson out  i didnt want to bother her ladyship if shes not well  shes resting but tell me anyway  its mrs patmore my lord  the time has come when we really have to make a decision   now do you believe me  careful thomas  your position is not a strong one  dont punish us mr carson its mr bates whos wanting here  tell me mr carson do you think it right a man like that should live and work at downton  mr napier my lady  what a surprise  im afraid youve just missed my aunt  i know  i watched her leave  how are your wedding plans going  not very well  in fact weve decided to call it off  really  it seemed quite fixed at sybils ball  what a shame please   itll be better in the long run  perhaps  i know what high hopes you have of the institution  the thing is lady mary  im here today because i needed to tell you something face to face before you went to the country  face to face gracious me  ive recently heard gossip about the time when i came to downton with kemal pamuk  gossip that i believe has made life difficult for you  ive also heard it said that i am the source of these stories  it is very important to me that you should know that i am not  from that day to this i have never spoken one word on the matter  then who did  it seems to have come from the turkish embassy  from the ambassador himself in fact and his wife  but who told them if not you  this is the hard part  when i discovered the answer i debated whether i should relay it  but in the end i feel you ought to know  the suspense is killing me  it was your sister lady edith who wrote to the ambassador  that is why people accept the story  edith  its very hard to believe  harder for you than for me  i love the thought of a baby in the house but if its a boy  itll be very hard on mr crawley  i know i was no great champion when he first arrived  but it seems to me hes tried his best and hes done the decent thing  i cant see that coming off  you dont mean the engagement  but its not an engagement yet is it  shed never throw him over  mr carson lady mary crawley does not deserve you  and shes not be in touch with cousin matthew  not that im told  wonderful news of course you must look after yourself  dont worry obrien has me wrapped in silk and feathers  youre lucky  i have a horrible feeling simmons is about to hand in her notice  shes looking very fidgety lately  and i saw her hurrying to meet the postman  oh you poor thing  is there anything worse than losing ones maid  why would she want to leave me  ive been as gentle as a lamb  most of the time  i want to say ill make provision for you  if its a boy and you get pushed out  dont worry i know you cant  if any man living understands the strength of the entail its me  i can give you crawley house for life if its a help   have you heard from mary  no have you  by the way i want to ask a favour whats the name of your cook  the one you brought with you from manchester  mrs bird   ill get it mrs patmore  dont fuss me   is that everything  yeah  how are you feeling  well most peoples parents die before them and so they should  oh give it a rest your mother knew how to drag it out ill say that for her   what  thomas  get up to the servery   you gave me the wrong cloth  sit down mrs patmore  i cant when ive got the luncheon to finish  it was not a suggestion sit  daisy and i will finish the luncheon  so hell give us this house for life will he how generous  it is generous he doesnt have to  but its made me think  you must stay here if you want  but i wonder if it mightnt be better all round if i went back to manchester  it may not be a boy  oh really mother you never approved of it all anyway in the first place  if it is a boy you should see it as a release  not a disappointment  what does mary say  nothing yet  you wanted to see mrs bird sir  yes mrs bird lord grantham has rather a favour to ask of you  im surprised lord grantham knows that i exist sir   im sorry to disturb you  quite all right  mr bates its about your somewhat startling confession  as youll have surmised his lordship has yet to make a decision  his delay is generous  however it will be no surprise to you  that miss obrien has  been unwilling to let things drop  it seems that when we were in london she made a new friend  a ladys maid in the house of a colonel in your former regiment  please tell me that this account is false at least in part  i wish i could  ill have to show this to his lordship  of course you will  i do not like to play the part of pontius pilate  but im afraid i must  lord grantham will decide whats to be done  mr bates i hope you do not feel that i treated you unjustly  on the contrary mr carson i am astonished at your kindness  of all of you sybil might find joy in a cottage but not you   we dont know itll be a boy  exactly  so ask matthew to wait until the child is born  if its a girl you can wed him happily and all will be as it was before  but if i delay wont he think im only after him for his position  besides im not sure i want to put him off  even without the title  we get on so well you know and hes terribly clever  he might end up lord chancellor  and he might not  oh come along mary be sensible  can you really see yourself dawdling your life away  as the wife of a country solicitor  but why would we ever want a telephone at downton my lord  well they have their uses  you could speak to the housekeeper in london  thatd be helpful surely  i hope i have not failed in my management of the recent move  not at all but the telephone is here now  and the girls got used to it when we were in london  besides none of us know what the next few months will bring  because of the archdukes death  austria wont get what it wants from serbia  and now russias starting to rumble  well theres not much we can do about that  so will you take care of the telephone man  oh about mr bates my lord  i expect youve had time to consider the contents of that letter  yes but i find it very odd  regimental silver  i could more easily see bates as an assassin than a petty pilferer  i agree and while the letter is hard to argue with  i wouldnt put anything past thomas or miss obrien   so what did we miss  nothing much  although youd have had more invitations than i did   have you thought about matthew  of course   but aunt rosamund says  no shes written to me i should pay no attention  but granny she has got a point mary cant be completely naive   i dont need your help thank you  mary listen to me  if you take matthew now when his whole future is at risk  he will love you to the end of his days  why granny youre a romantic  ive been called many things but never that  and what happens if the baby is a boy and matthew loses everything   mary can always change her mind  but i cant do that to matthew  its not how we are together  im going upstairs to help anna unpack  ill come with you  edith why dont you go too  sir anthony strallan was at lady wrens party  he asked after you   is she really serious about him  any port in a storm  by the way i must write about my maid  shes leaving to get married   how could she be so selfish  i do sympathise  roberts always wanted me to get rid of obrien but i cant face it  anyway shes so fond of me  well i thought simmons was fond of me  what am i to do  well ill put an advertisement in the lady its always the best place to start  oh thats so kind thank you  i really must be going  now dont let mary wait for the baby before she gives matthew her answer  im sure its another girl  i know those men of the moral high ground  if she wont say yes when he might be poor  he wont want her when he will be rich  maybe we should knit something  oh yes im sure theyd love a pair of bootees knitted by you  or what about a christening mug they can buy their own silver   anything in the paper thomas  theyve arrested this princip fella with his gang  all serbian and members of the black hand   the black hand  i dont like the sound of that  i dont like the sound of any of it  war is on the way  then well have to face it as bravely as we can  thank you mr cannon fodder  dont you think a wars coming  oh therell be a war all right and its time to prepare for it   the country do you mean  no me  you never disappoint  daisy run and find mrs patmore  his lordship wants to see her in the library  his lordship wants mrs patmore to go up to the library  that is what i said  and anna youre to come too  and we thought the assassination of an archduke was a surprise  mrs patmore my lord  your lordship i know things havent been quite right for a while   but i can assure you  come in mrs patmore  i promise you my lord if i could just be allowed a bit more time  mrs patmore i have not asked you here to give you your notice   havent you  no   i understand youve had some trouble with your sight  thats just it   i know i could manage better if  please mrs patmore  let him speak   beg pardon my lord  dont apologise  now on dr clarksons recommendation  im sending you up to london to see an eye specialist at moorfields  anna will go with you and youll stay with my sister rosamund  in her new house in belgrave square  im afraid im going to have to sit in your presence my lord  of course  but how will you get on here  well mrs crawley is lending us her cook mrs bird  shes coming over tomorrow you will be good enough to show her how things work  are the crawleys to starve while im away  theyll eat here every evening  now my sisters butler will look after you  hes very nice  anna you wont mind a visit to london  no my lord thank you itll be an adventure  one with a happy ending i hope  let me get this clear at sybils ball you said youd give me your answer the day you got back   and now you say you will not  why do we have to rush into it   i need to be sure thats all  but you were sure  i know what has altered you my prospects   because nothing else has changed  no         yes  if your mothers child is a boy then hes the heir and i go back to living on my wits   youd rather not follow me  oh matthew you always make everything so black and white  i think this is black and white  do you love me enough to spend your life with me  if you dont then say no   if you do then say yes  i want to  granny told me i should say yes now  then withdraw if you lost everything  to make that work youd have to be a good liar   are you a good liar  not good enough to try apparently  how could you not have realised theyd discover the loss at once  and to keep them in your house   but you only served two years  thats right my lord  so clearly the judge thought there was some mitigating factor  i just want to know the truth  i cannot speak of it my lord  you must decide whether i stay or go on the basis of the evidence before you  i will respect that  im sorry i dont believe it  how can you say that when ive confessed to the crime  his lordship obviously doesnt think thats all there is to it  and i dont either  anna are you set for the nine oclock train tomorrow  all packed and ready  youll be met at kings cross by lady rosamunds chauffeur  which i think is generous but after that youre on your own  right i must get on im acting referee for mrs patmore and mrs bird  best of luck  will you miss me  try not to miss me itll be good practice  i expect itll be hard adjusting to this kitchen   after the one youre used to  not to worry  im sure i can have it cleaned up in no time   cleaned up  im not criticising  with your eyesight its a wonder you could see the pots at all   youll have met daisy and the others  i have  though what they all find to do is a mystery to me  are you not used to managing staff mrs bird  im used to getting it done with one kitchen maid mrs patmore  but i suppose in a house like this you expect to take it easy  do you think we should erect a ring and let them fight it out  shes all right mrs bird  shes more of a general than a trooper but you need that in a cook  mrs patmores the generalissimo  well im very sad  i thought mary was made of better stuff  dont speak against her  of course shes taken advice from someone with false and greedy values   mother  and we dont have to go too far to know who that is   ive a good mind  you do not go near cousin violet that is an order   somethings not right about it  i agree  having a silver thief in the house does not seem right at all  even if he could walk  but carson isnt keen to get rid of him either  and he normally comes down on this sort of thing like a storm of bricks   whats his reasoning  he blames thomas and obrien  he says theyve been working against bates since he got here   so i should sack obrien instead  youll hear no argument from me  this should do the trick my lady  ten years of my life thats what ive given her ten bloody years   but did she say shed sack you  its obviously what he wants   so when will they tell you  when theyve found a replacement  heaven forefend she should have to put a comb through her own hair   and if im going you wont be far behind  oh so what  sod em  theres a war coming and war means change   we should be making plans  what are you talking about  well put it like this  i dont want to be a footman any more  but i dont intend to be killed in battle neither  im not saying poison them  just make sure they dont find her food all that agreeable   by poisoning it  will you stop that  you dont want it to taste nice  i want them to be glad when i get back thats all  this will be for the family  and the one in my pantry for the staff or more precisely me  you dont know we dont provide two  then perhaps we should find another suplier  oh hold your horses  right where do you said this other telephone  here in the outer hall   good afternoon carson is lady edith in  i am i most certainly am   i was just driving past  yes  and i thought you might like to come for a spin if youre not too busy   wait till i get my coat  is it all right if i make some notes   im so sorry mr  this is mr bromidge my lady  hes here about the telephone  oh please make your notes dear mr bromidge  were so looking forward to it what an exciting business to be in   you must be expanding every day  oh we are sir  but that brings its problems  training up men for the work when many have no aptitude  i cant even find a secretary who can keep pace with the moment   what  its hard with a new concept  too old and they cant change  too young and theyve no experience  but have you filled the post yet cause i know just the woman  well she must hurry up well close the list tomorrow night  youll have her application i promise  moorfields eye hospital   this isnt bad at all is it  i dont know  no one told me thered be an actual operation  what did you think  they were just going to make magic passes over your eyes  all right mrs patmore  shell be fine thank you  and youve been sent to us by the earl of grantham   thats right  very good you can leave now  well keep her in for a week you can collect her next friday   ill be in to visit every day  what about the rest of the time  dont worry  youll be fine   bates you say  john bates  he must have left the army about eight years ago  wait here please   have you finished the soup  i think so mrs bird   and the sauce for the fish  yes mrs bird  then put them in the warmer  you dont mean john bates who went to prison for theft   thats correct  well i know who he is right enough  that was an odd business   why odd  never mind  so youre his cousin and youd like to be in touch  very forgiving  well ive got no address for him or his wife  but i have got one for his mother which should still be good  ive written it down for you  thank you for your trouble  is it true you wrote to the turkish ambassador about kemal   who told you  someone who knows that you did  then why are you asking  because i wanted to give you one last chance to deny it  and what if i did he had a right to know how his countryman died  in the arms of a slut  hows that advertisement getting on for new maid  well its only just come out  we can manage here now go tell mrs bird well have our dinner in 20 minutes  carson be sure to say to mrs bird the dinner was really delicious   so how was the drive  it was lovely  only  yes  well he said he had a question for me  he told me hed ask it at the garden party and  he hoped id say yes  you must think very carefully what your answer will be  yes i should think very carefully about a lot of things   do your neighbours have one  yes they do in london anyway  it seems very wise to get this telephone now  if there is a war it may be very hard to have one installed in a private house  let me show you where were going to put it  first electricity now telephones  sometimes i feel as if i were living in an hg wells novel  but the young are all so calm about change arent they  look at matthew i do admire him  do you   what have i done wrong now  oh please  dont pretend marys sudden reluctance  cant be traced back to you  well i shall pretend it i told her to take him  your quarrel is with my daughter rosamund not me  so put that in your pipe and smoke it  mr molesley what are you after  i want a word with mr carson im here to have my dinner   you dont want much do you  what are you doing  mr carson dropped his wallet in the passage i was replacing it  but everything seemed so settled between you at sybils ball  things have changed since then  not necessarily  i dont seem to be much good at making boys  any more than im much good at building my life on shifting sands  you do know i should be very proud to have you as my soninlaw  whatever your prospects  unfortunately sir your daughter is more practical than you   will you join us mrs bird  i dont mind if i do  im not sure mrs patmore would like that mr carson  cook always eats separate thats what she says  not in our house theres only the four of us  well youre going any minute shes advertised for your replacement  that filthy ungrateful cow  let the kitchen maids have theirs on their own  you stay with us  her ladyship said to tell you that the dinner was delicious   she cant have  daisy does that surprise you  what have you done with this you little beggar  i knew it  thats why i said it was for upstairs  come on tell us whats in it  just water and  a bit of soap  and youve put something in the fish sauce as well  only mustard and aniseed  why daisy why would you do such a thing  mrs patmore was worried than theyd prefer mrs birds cooking   and they wouldnt want her to come back  is that likely  when theyve taken such trouble to get her well  im sorry  there there  there are worse crimes on earth than loyalty  dry your eyes and fetch the beef stew i was making for tomorrow  youve not had a chance to spoil that i suppose  those going make seen some syrup of figs but ive not done it yet   but at least wed  all have been regular  carson said you were here  just checking that everythings being done right my lady  only we never heard back that is miss dawson never heard back from you  about an interview  er yes we got the young ladys letter  but the trouble is she didnt have any obvious experience of hard work   but shes a very hard worker  i couldnt find any proof of it  and she gave you as a reference when you dont run a business my lady  well not that im aware of  lily can you find gwen and tell her to come to the hall now  yes my lady  the reason gwen didnt give any more details  is because she works here as a housemaid  ah and you thought thatd put me off  but shes taken a postal course  and has good speeds in typing and pitman shorthand test her  i will if i like the look of her  ah so young lady  you thought id turn up my nose at a housemaid   well i did sir  well my mother was a housemaid  ive got nothing against housemaids  they know about hard work and long hours thats for sure  i believe so sir  right well is there somewhere we could talk  gwen take mr bromidge to the library  ill see no one disturbs you  sorry papa you cant go in there  why on earth not  gwens in there with mr bromidge shes being interviewed  i cannot use my library  because one of the housemaids is in there applying for another job  thats about the size of it  so what is it you want to know  i want to know the truth about the case against him  i want to know why the sergeant thought it was odd  i want to know what mr bates isnt saying  because you dont believe him to be guilty  no i dont  i know hes not  well  youre right of course  then who was it who was the thief  his wife vera  who do you call no one you know has got one  but they will have youll see  might i enquire why my pantry has become a common room  sorry mr carson  but do you know how it works   of course i do  could you show us  certainly not a telephone is not a toy  but a useful and valuable tool now get back to your work  she worked at the barracks sometimes helping at big dinners and so on  that night her opportunity came and she took it  they knew it was her  someone even saw her with a big carryall  but why did he confess  well  john wasnt the same man in those days  the african war had shaken him up and made him angry  hed been wounded  and he drunk a lot more than was good for him   was he violent  no no not violent  he could had hard at times with a tongue like a razor  he felt hed ruined veras life miss smith   do you agree with him  no  i thought she was a nasty piece of work but  thats why he tooks the blame   surely if everyone knew he was innocent  but he confessed  there was nothing anybody could do once hed confessed  could i ask you something sir  only i get the feeling that a wars on the way  im afraid we all do  and when it comes i want to be really useful to my country   how heartening  so ive been thinking  what could be more useful than what you do  bringing people back to health back to life  i see  well erm we are looking for volunteers to train for the territorial force hospitals   if thats what you mean  its exactly what i mean   will you not be missed here  maybe but well all be going wont we  the younger men anyway  as you wish ill make enquiries  thank you very much doctor  mr molesley walked in and there he was as bold as brass  taking my wallet out of my change coat  mr molesley would have no reason to make it up my lord  he doesnt know thomas why would he lie  so thomas has been caught redhanded  well we knew he was a thief  and now we have unimpeachable proof   im afraid he has to go  oh i hate this sort of thing  with lady granthams condition and everything  can we at least wait until after the garden party  very well my lord but then i think we must act   how long will you wear them  a week or so  but i can see much better already even with them on  thank heaven now we need to talk about the garden party   mrs bird and i have made some lists  hum mrs bird  i think we can manage without any help from mrs bird  can you  well if you want your garden party to be run by blind pugh thats your business  mrs patmore theres a lot to be done and youre only just up on your feet   we really cannot manage without mrs bird  if you say so  now ive been checking the stores  and ive ordered what youll need for the baking  thats very kind mrs hughes but i believe we should check the stores  when its convenient  mrs bird at downton abbey  the housekeeper manages the store cupboard but i think if  ive never not run my own store cupboard in my life  separate the cook from the store cupboard wheres the sense in that  how long have i been saying this oh lord  were the ones who cook it we should be the ones to order it  mrs bird i shall be very happy of your help with the garden party  im sure we can manage it easily between the two of us  hello  this is downton abbey  carson the butler speaking  hello  this is mr carson the butler of downton abbey  to whom am i speaking  im not shouting  who are you  oh mrs gaunt  no i dont want to place a call  i was practising my answer  well i daresay a lot of the things you do sound stupid to other people  ive written to your mother shes very anxious naturally  she suggested coming over   oh god  well thats what i thought  so i put her off told her to come and admire the baby   ill just run your ladyships bath  thank you obrien   oh have you had any answers about the position  quite a few   so what did they sound like  theres one i think has real possibilities

just our employers theyre not our flesh and blood   thomas dont be so unkind  there is nothing left on earth you respect  ark at im  blimey if he carries on like this for the unborn baby of a woman
