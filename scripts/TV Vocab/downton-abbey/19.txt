ways  im afraid thats the case shes been working as a prostitute  my my thats not a word you hear in this house every day no  but i think it also shows the measure of her misery  ethel has been driven into this of that i have no doubt  if only she would allow me to help her but she wont  if this letter can give a clue as to how i may help please let me know  i will maam  your sentiments do you credit  but i suspect she will be too ashamed  to face how far shes fallen  good night good night mrs crawley  so am i to answer to you both of course not  what lord grantham means  is that ive made an investment in the estate that is all  otherwise nothing has changed very good  can we bring the staff back up to snuff  i believe we can  mrs hughes is short of a house maid mrs patmore wants a kitchen maid  and i need a new footman do you really  i sometimes feel the world  is different than it was before the war  i would like to return to my duties as a butler sir  but if you prefer i continue to do the work of a second footman  in addition mr crawley does not mean that do you  certainly not that is good news its too late to get into shape  before the dinner for the archbishop of york  but itll be the last time youll have to fudge it  ill do my best with an added spring in my step  why dont you have breakfast in bed because im not married  yes but now that the others are what difference would it make  you know what i mean i prefer to be up and about  tennessee is going to ratify the 19th amendment meaning  all us women will have the vote which is more than here  they almost do  i dont have the vote im not over  its ridiculous you should write to the times  maybe i will  ask your mother if she needs any help with tonights dinner  theres nothing so toffeenosed as a prince of the church  put him next to your grandmother shell handle him  sighs  oh anna youll be happy to hear as soon as we take on a new house maid  youll be a ladys maid to lady mary at last  thats

woman with a brain  and reasonable ability  stop whining and find something to do  sighs  im going out anna ive told mrs patmore  i think everythings under control for tonight  whats the matter nothing  except  i havent had a letter from mr bates in weeks  i worry i worry that hes being gallant  and trying to set me free  that he wants me to make a new life without him  i doubt it very much  then why would he be silent like this and stop me visiting  obviously i dont know why  but i do know thered be a good reason  do you really think so  id swear to it  they know you tricked them who

bouillon which is drunk from a smaller dish  off you go now i must get on  youre taking a lot of trouble with alfred  i feel quite jealous  i dont know why he asked for help  you never did  its very hard to begin  well find a way we all have lives to lead  could you write to the bryants  to say i want them to have charlie  weve already been down this path  to no avail i know  and i know i said a mothers love was worth more than they had to give  but i said it for me not for him  my dear you mustnt do anything until youre absolutely sure  mrs hughes said we all have lives to lead but that isnt true  ive got no life  i exist but barely we know the route youve taken  its good of you to have me here i work with others like you  to rebuild their lives cant we work together  to find a way for you to keep your son with his grandparents  charlie can build a life that is whatever he wishes it to be  you and i working together could never offer him that  you want me to write to them again  but leave it vague say ethel would like them  to keep in contact with their son  i wont change my mind nevertheless thats what ill do  then theyll be no disappointment  if youll forgive me weve a big

involved they think i was part of it one of the instigators  the police are looking for you i couldnt go home  if they took me i wouldnt get a fair hearing  you gave them sybil while you saved yourself  i dont think theyll hold her but if they do  im ready to go back and face the consequences youd better be  you must see the home secretary and say what the police say  he was there he says he wasnt i didnt say i wasnt there  why were you  for the fun of seeing private property destroyed  those places are different for me  i dont see charm and gracious living  i see something horrible  its a jungle castle i rather agree mama  you are not helping but when i saw them  standing there with their children  all of them in tears watching their home burn  i was sorry i admit it  i dont want their type to govern ireland i want a free state  but i was sorry  never mind that whats happened to sybil  we agreed that i should leave at once  and that shed close the flat and follow  i got the

followed  didnt you think wed keep a check on our grandson  were not judging you im judging her  i judge her and i find her wanting  ethel weve decided to offer you some money  to make things easier

though things havent gone so well lately  i hope that you can accept our offer ethel  and that we can be friends we both wish you well dont we  i dont wish you ill ill say that  i cant accept your offer  and we wont be friends  what  not even for charlies sake  i think you love my son mr bryant  i dont think youre a nice or kind man  but i believe you love my boy  so youll be pleased by what ive come here to say  any news while i was out  no perhaps the home secretary wont see him  papa will pull some strings until he does  aha youve started on the augean task how are you getting on  not badly im beginning to get a sense of how it works  its probably best you tackle it by yourself  ah carson may we please have some tea oh of course my lady  anna said youre interviewing footmen today that is correct  have you chosen the lucky winner  not yet there were two candidates when it came down to it  one was steady but not much else  but the ladies downstairs want the other one  why is that  i dont know precisely unless its because hes more handsome  of course its because hes more handsome  do pick him and cheer us all up a bit  alfreds nice but he looks like a puppy rescued from a puddle  this new one seems very sure of himself  you can manage that cant you  i suppose i could sir  its settled then tell the maids they can buy their valentines  so be it my lady  but alfred is very good you know hes very willing  even if he is miss obriens nephew  both chuckle  clearly nothing worse could be said of any man  chuckles  hell want to say goodbye  i give you my blessings for your whole life long my darling boy  you wont remember that or me  but theyll stay with you all the same  lets not make a meal of it  mummy  ill write to you  ill never see my son again  never is a long time ethel  but you were right he does love charlie  and not just for his fathers sake  i must be going  ill say goodbye  car doors close  cries  youve done a hard thing today ethel  the hardest thing of all  you dont agree do you  i dont want to make you doubt now that its happened  youve done the right thing for the boy ethel  whatever mrs crawley may say begging your pardon maam  perhaps youre right i am  until we live in a very different world from this one  well then  i should be away  what chance is there for a woman like her  shes taken the road to ruin  theres no way back  stand up against the wall the pair of you  what you looking for just keep quiet  mr turner well well  a very mysterious package i dont think  craig  what do you call this  i dont know ive done nothing  youd better come with us craig  youll be sorry  key turns in lock  oh thank god  sniffles  im so sorry  its all right  they didnt try to stop me  it doesnt mean they wont come after us  unless papa can persuade them otherwise  how could you have left her to fend for herself  it wasnt like that we thought this might happen and decided what to do  the question is what now you must not travel before the babys born  tom wants it to be born in dublin he wont hold you to that now  wont this be the first place they look  how could you be part of it the drungores are like us  she came out with me she was laura dunsaney then  how could you dance round her burning house its horrible he didnt  and isnt dancing now knock at door  come in  telegram for you my lady  your fathers coming home hes seen mr short  what happened he doesnt say  only that neither of you is to leave downton  youre back  i am  anything happened here theres a new footman  came today how was london quite fun as a matter of fact  has the firebrand been saved  thats not for me to say is it mr molesley  id better take these upstairs  you got the job then im on my way mr barrow  they say you were a footman once  thats right can i come to you if theres anything i need to know  certainly why not  never go back to ireland impossible youll be put in prison  its the best i could manage  surely they need proof to ban a man from his own country  they have more proof than tom will concede is that fair  hes admitted to being there hes told you but he didnt tell me  he attended meetings where attacks on the angloirish were planned  i was always against any personal violence i swear it  so at least we can sleep in our beds  maybe but you werent against the destruction of property  that was worse than i expected  what was the deal you made with the home secretary  they dont want to make a martyr of him  with sybil they think they could have another maud gonne or lady gregory  lady gregory countess markievicz  why are the irish rebels so well born  whatever the reason i dont want sybil to join their ranks  mercifully nor do the irish authorities  if tom can stay away theyll leave him alone  i cant be kept away from ireland  youll be arrested the moment you touch dry land  now then do what mr carson tells you  i know what im about are you all right alfred yes  shouldnt i be carrying the pork and you the veg im first footman  never mind that go isnt alfred first footman  thats for mr carson to decide  by heck its nice to think were running at full strength again  really im running at full strength with noone to help  all in good time daisy all in good time  what do you mean you wrote to a newspaper  no lady writes to a newspaper  what about lady sarah wilson shes the daughter of a duke  shes a churchill the churchills are different  have we no churchill blood grannys right  can somebody write that down  its good to have strong views but notoriety is never helpful  ive sent it now it wont be published  thank you for the vote of confidence  this is our new footman mama what do we call you jimmy  james your ladyship this is james  welcome to downton james thank you my lord  clears throat  well done carson that mustve cheered up the maids  he looks like a footman in a musical review poor alfred  we mustnt allow him to be overshadowed quite right my lady  hard work and diligence weigh more than beauty in the real world  if only that were true  ive never been james in my life i was jimmy to lady anstruther  i dont care if you were father christmas  youre james now and will stay james while youre at downton  he thinks hes the big cheese make no mistake  thats because he is  hes nice that new bloke isnt he  why do you say that oh only an impression thats all  if youll excuse me im going to bed  can you tell the others tomorrow well make some plans  i dont know how  youve lived out of ireland before surely you can again  irelands coming of age i need to be part of that  but i know what youve done for me kept me free  and i am grateful truly  poor chap im sure he is grateful no hes not  he says it to keep the peace with sybil  but i only rescued him for her sake so were even  did you get a chance to look through the books they brought in  as a matter of fact i did could you make them out i think so  i was waiting for a good moment to discuss them oh  yes there were some aspects of the way things have been done  i wasnt quite sure about you sound like murray  do i hes always going on about how we should overhaul this or that  nothings ever right for him well i hesitate to say it  we should let them get in here we can talk about it another time  key turns in lock  these came for you bates  when when did they come  they came when you were out of favour  now youre in favour again  why what have i done  just watch out for mr durrant youre not a favourite with him  key turns in lock  sniffs  what  are you going to take that over me  i was just making myself some toast  you have to set the number on the dial and i set it too high  but ive got the hang of it now would you like a piece  i thought mr branson might try to burn the house down  but i didnt think you would no  you should never take anything for granted mr carson  no no no not now  chuckles  you never told me you went to those meetings  i never told you i didnt what else havent you told me  all i know is i cant stay here not for long  you must and so must i  and you must let the baby be born here  youre very free with your musts  i will not be free with our childs chances  we need peace and safety  downton can offer us both  god in heaven earls daughter speaks out for womens rights  what in a letter to this newspaper today  lady edith crawley daughter of the earl of grantham  condemns the limitations of the womens suffrage bill  and denounces the governments aims  to return women to their prewar existence  you said they wouldnt print it thats most impressive  dont say you support her of course i do and so do you  when youve had a chance to think about it so i should hope  what do you think carson id rather not say  anna yes  theres quite a packet of letters arrived for you earlier  are they all from mr bates  it looks like it  why so many at once i neither know nor care  just as long as ive got them  thanks for sticking up for me last night  it wont make any difference  no but its good to know youre on my side  i am on your side alfred  in fact  theres something ive wanted to say  youve got my attention well  here we are daisy id like to introduce miss ivy stuart  the new kitchen maid and this is daisy my assistant cook  my arent you a sight for sore eyes miss stuart  thats enough of that alfreds a footman so dont listen to him  shoo  tell me if you need any help  sorry daisy what were you saying  nothing dont matter now  i hope were going to get on  we dont have to get on we have to work together  a situation has arisen  and im not quite sure which way to turn  obviously if youve turned to me robert wont discuss the matter  and mary is affronted by the very mention of it  but given that ive sunk my own fortune alongside everyone elses  into into downton i feel a duty  apart from anything else  to do what i can  about  downton is being mismanaged cousin violet  and something must be done  the thing is how do i do it without putting peoples noses out of joint  oh my dear oh i doubt theres a way to achieve that  you must do what needs to be done of course but  i think i can safely say a great many noses will be out of joint  sniffles  chuckles  sighs  laughs  edith has been invited to write a newspaper column  when will she get an offer to appear on the london stage  i thought you might work here for a while you thought  im always a failure in this family  she meant you to be hanged for her suicide it was her revenge  what a revenge mrs crawleys hired a prostitute to manage her house  i dont remember ethel as a great cook  please tell mr barrow him to keep his distance what are you implying
