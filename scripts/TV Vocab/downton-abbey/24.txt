rose dont wear them out  we remembered how you liked our mountain loch  and weve arranged for luncheon to be taken up there one day  that was my idea  well whosever idea it was its a lovely one  tea is in the library when youre ready to come down  excited chatter  im looking for a mrs patmore  why is that then ive got some deliveries for her  really where from  youre not very curious are you   and youre not one of our regulars  well if you must know ive taken over from mr cox in thirsk  mr patmore sent an order in to him whats this  do i hear my name taken in vain  i was just explaining you sent an order in to mr cox  ive bought the shop and all the stock  so i took the liberty of filling it out  how do you know she wants to do business with you  all right mr barrow i can fight my own battles thank you  so where is this order then  bring it to the kitchen  and whats your name since you know mine  its tufton joss tufton  hmm  whats this  some vichyssoise left over from last night  oh thats heaven  any more leftovers going begging  have a bit of the tart if you like  i dont mind if i do  ive not had food that good since the last time i were in london  im not just a pretty face  this familys fallen on its feet and no mistake  i wouldnt mind eating food like that every day  enough of the flannel ill keep the order but  if theres owt amiss youll be hearing from me  lets just hope that theres something not quite up to scratch  why do you say that  cos id like to hear from you again mrs patmore  i would  be off with you you cheeky devil go on  are you not hungry  its a bit early for us we eat our dinner after the familys  oh i agree with you miss crawley  in london we eat last thing when all the work is done  and i prefer it  how about you miss grantham  me  oh i do what im told  it makes me laugh when i hear miss obrien and mr bates called mr and miss grantham  miss bates and i dont often work in the same house party  of course  you two are married miss crawley  how do you manage at home being called bates and bates  were not they still call me anna like when i was a housemaid  which isnt right  i do so hate to see a ladys maid downgraded  oh i so agree miss grantham  but then we would think alike wouldnt we  its a treat to have a kindred spirit come to stay it really is  tell mrs crane ive gone up  ill announce dinner in 10 minutes  how marvellous  i should remind you that hell be back  to pipe us awake at eight oclock  and he keeps it up through breakfast  so the chances of getting back to sleep again are nil  all right shrimpie the point has been made  youve no need to apologise  im glad to see the old ways being maintained  tomorrow well kit you out with some rifles for some practice  and what is planned for the women  well theres a picnic by the loch the day after tomorrow  and the ghillies ball on friday is always good fun  as long as its not too much fun  as a matter of fact a friend of mine is staying quite nearby  i thought i might telephone him  but you must ask him here she doesnt have to  oh please do id like to meet him  thats settled then invite him to dinner tomorrow night  unless of course susan objects  why on earth would i object  i thought it was too good to be true  hes sent dried ginger instead of fresh  its my fault i just put ginger because mr cox knew what i liked  i might go into thirsk tomorrow  i can take it back for you if you want  would you you should go with him alfred youd like that shop  whos doing what tomorrow  mr barrows going in to thirsk i said alfred should go with him  who says i can spare them what about mr bransons luncheon  i doubt he needs an underbutler mr carson  or two footmen  he told me hed get lunch at the grantham arms  so can they go  i suppose so but theres a lot to be done and dont forget it  i hope youll come here whenever you like  it must be odd being alone in that great house  well im not alone  theres people i know well  except theyre all downstairs and im up  well why not take the opportunity to spend some time with them  i dont think old lady grantham would approve of that  no but i doubt she approves of the working class learning to read  tom can i take this chance to say  youve managed a very delicate transition superbly  thank you  but dont be too eager to please  you have a new identity  and i dont mean because youre not a chauffeur any more  you are the agent of this estate  and as the agent you have a perfect right  to talk to anyone who works under you  anyone you choose  thats quite a speech i mean it  you have a position now and youre entitled to use it  mr branson  i didnt want to drag one of you upstairs to open the door  that was kind  i wondered if you would allow the maids to clean during the day  while the familys in scotland  you dont need my permission  but i do  and if you want to use a particular room then please let me know  and well vacate it at once  thank you mrs hughes  good night good night mr branson  i was a bit shaken up on the train  please dont say anything  i dont want to worry mr crawley  you dont want to give him the satisfaction you mean  i cant spoil his last treat before fatherhood claims him  not that hell change his ways much if hes like most men  are they looking after you  oh yes  but im a bit nervous about this ghillies ball  why  i suppose i just feel so  english  i dont want to look a fool  i love reeling if i werent pregnant id dance until dawn  but you are pregnant milady  bagpiper strikes up  bloody hell  welcome to the highlands  now take your time  youre not chasing a pheasant be calm and confident  i thought i was  these are noble beasts  we must take them out for the good of the herd  but theyve earned our respect and deserve a clean death  fine words  how are you getting on  not too bad your lordship  thats high praise from nield hes being kind  i doubt your father needs much practice  his lordship was born with a rod in one hand and a gun in the other  that sounds rather uncomfortable  i love to hear your ghillie speak  its like a voice from a bygone age  wheres susan aunt violet wanted to see the gardens  so i left them to it  rose is not anxious for her mothers company  hows it going with you  im in for an adventure  im to don a ceremonial uniform and hold mighty sway  on some distant shore  you wont mind a foreign posting  why not  they say a change of sink is as good as a rest  hello  you do know where it will be  no but it will be filthy and dirty and the food will be awful  and there will be noone to talk to for a hundred square miles  it sounds like a week with my motherinlaw  will rose go too why  whats she been saying  my dear noone can accuse me of being modern  but even i can see its no crime to be young  i know that aunt violet  but you dont see how they gang up on me  then i shall strive to keep the peace  thats all very well but you are my mothers sister  and you can jolly well be on my side  id like to travel more  we see a bit of london in the season otherwise its yorkshire  what about the house of lords  when his lordship goes up he just takes mr bates with him  and stays in his club which is no use to me  were headed for an outpost of empire  her ladyships dreading it and so am i  oh i dont know  something different  i could quite fancy that  well not me  all sweat and gyppy tummy oh no  clears throat  did you get him i did  he said hed love to come  im sure he would what do you mean by that  i cant imagine mr gregson finds himself at duneagle castle often  or anywhere like it mary that sounds very snobbish  whats he doing up here  hes on a sketching holiday hes sketching and fishing  fishing oh well thats something i suppose  what do you suppose  for some reason marys decided to be nasty about michael gregson  i was questioning his motives for being in the highlands  hes brought his pencils and his rods whats wrong with that  nothing at all so there  afternoon george  can you do me a sandwich please  this is very daring  sitting in a pub on your own  want the village to cut you off dead forever  i knew you were coming in  and i dont care about all that stuff  do you have the day off  ill fudge it but no weve extra cleaning while the familys away  of course your family  well i am and im not as im sure you know  anna said when you first came back as lady sybils husband  you refused to dress the part but you do now  i was tired of talking about my clothes  every time i came downstairs  im still the same man inside  then why not join us for dinner one night instead of eating alone  well tell her ill not forget again  by heck it were worth a visit mr tufton what a range  ive never heard of some of those spices  ill tell you what weve got a fair starting here on friday  i run a stall and so do some of the suppliers  why not come what sort of fair  well the usual sort of fair food games morris dancers  can we get the time off i dont see why not jimmy  well i might come if theres a crowd of us but not otherwise  have you got a minute  ill just put a note in that bag for mrs patmore  go on then  i cant let them go gallivanting off to every fair at the drop of a hat  i mean what are we paying them for  theyve been working very hard  dont they deserve a treat excuse me  on friday can i take the afternoon off  ill make the servants dinner and ivy and daisy can serve it  mrs patmore doesnt often take the time shes allowed  what about mr branson ill see to mr branson  where are you going or shouldnt we ask  theres a fair in thirsk  a friend of mine has asked me to meet him there  i dont believe it  must i be undermined at every turn  ooh  whats got into him  mr barrow and the boys have asked to go to the same fair  and he was trying to find a way to say no  why dont we all go  ill make mr branson a tray and he can keep charge of the house  he wont mind come on  itll be fun  murmur of voices  mr gregson  this is very kind of you lady flintshire not a bit  its a pleasure to welcome a friend of dear ediths  what a disappointment he looks perfectly normal  since he came with the express purpose of dining at duneagle  he obviously bought a set of tails  come and meet my parents  mama granny papa  this is mr gregson lady grantham  you know i started to read your magazine because of ediths column  but now i wouldnt miss it  it puzzles me why you choose to employ amateurs like my daughter  i agree well is the distinction very meaningful  surely the most important thing is whether she has something to say  come and meet my sister mary  do stand up youre slouching like a field hand  might i just have five minutes without being criticised  we knew things were awkward between them  but now that im here i dont think susan handles it very well  it is so complicated with a young daughter whos full of new ideas  she thinks youre fighting her  when all the time youre just frightened  im sorry  we all miss her  every single day  were going in everyone  knock at door come in  whos that  would you like me to take miss sibby up to the nursery thank you  go with edna darling  come here  can i ask you something  be my guest please  are you ashamed of who you are or of who you were  is that why you wont eat your dinner with us  no  it is not  well id better be going  it never really gets dark here does it  not like further south no  lets take a picnic out tomorrow just the two of us  theyll be gone for the day what do you say  id love it  sobs  is everything all right milady  it will be if you dont tell my mother you saw me smoking  dont worry  youre safe with us would you like a peppermint  i better had thank you  oh sorry  its just my mother has been unusually impossible this evening  my whole childhood would seem impossible to you milady  but i survived  so will you  rose who are you talking to  shh come inside at once  everyones in the drawingroom  thanks for the mint  i should be away  oh dont go just yet  heaven knows ive no desire to  it makes a welcome change from reading a medical journal  and going to bed with well a glass of whisky  goodness  i wondered what you were going to say for a moment  i sometimes forget when we meet in the splendour of the abbey  that you were a doctors wife  that you know what my life consists of in a way that noone else does  at any rate not around here  i know  its a relief to be able to talk without having to explain oneself isnt it  a relief and a privilege  and i hope we can do it again  soon  matthews asked me to go out stalking with him tomorrow  so i thought i would  michael can i ask you why youre here  tell me the truth please  well i want to get to know your family  what do you hope to achieve  i thought if they knew me if they came to like me  they might find it easier to be on my side  it wont change the basic facts though will it  edith my basic fact is that im in love with you  you know that already do i  yes i suppose i do  i want you in my life  and i want to be in yours  thats all very well but  i just cant see a happy ending  edith dear  stop fascinating that young man and come and make a four at bridge  sighs  ive asked gregson to come  i wont see you all day so hell be company  he was right to invest in those tails wasnt he  you know susans invited him to the ghillies ball  he probably had reeling classes before he left london  dont dislike him before you know him  thats the hallmark of our parents generation and i forbid it  just be as nice as you are  you think me nice but nobody else does  what makes you so sure i am  because ive seen you naked and held you in my arms  and i know the real you  goodness what a testimonial  oh go on you were young once  im young now  well not old  all the more reason to say yes  oh youll enjoy yourself  no i wont be coming  if i came they wouldnt have fun  theyd spend the day looking over their shoulder  well im going whether i spoil their fun or not  thats different they respect you of course  but i am their leader  well thats put me in my place  dont envy me mrs hughes  you know what they say  uneasy lies the head that wears the crown  the wind is northwest and getting stronger  we should get started  well good hunting everyone  oh shrimpies not stalking hes coming with me  mr crawley mr gregson  is your picnic under control of course  im worried about mary bumping through the glen  she doesnt have to come no i know  but she will wed best get going or were in for some stick  walk on  im not sure im going tomorrow its such a waste of money  oh come on youve enough for a few rides and a beef sandwich  i can buy you all a bottle of pop  what an offer lets take him up on it before he thinks again  thank you mr barrow but i can buy my own pop  dont pretend youve money to burn  i can always get money  the store cupboards open if you need anything  no but i do have something to ask you  now where did i put that box  this one  did you see the lid mrs kearneys dress shop in ripon  shes got a fancy man im telling you  mrs patmore why not shes a woman isnt she  only technically  birdsong  oh i was looking for lady mary to tell her were going  shes already gone down milady  you were kind to cheer me up yesterday  i did feel terribly blue  thats all right  you must let me know if i can return the favour  as a matter of fact  there is something you could help me with  shall i take it from here  we can bring it to a better place  we dont rush things at duneagle  well thats true god knows  you dont think its too girlish  whats the matter with being girlish once in a while  heaven knows we dont have much opportunity  well id wear a coat over it so it wouldnt jump out at you  i hope hes worth it  read that  i hope you will allow me the honour of squiring you through the day  no mans wanted to squire me since the golden jubilee  even then he expected me to buy the drinks  suppose he wants something more  i beg your pardon  there is only one reason a man his age courts a respectable woman  he finds himself in need of a wife  flowing water  is there anything to drink  there certainly is  beer  thats very racy of you  i am racy  what shall we drink to  the future  and your scottish blood  what are you up to  nothing  what are you up to  nothing  giggles  well you managed that very well  when the time comes for me to go ill ask them to send for you  is everything all right shrimpie  of course impertinent to ask  no its not all right  but whats the point in talking about it  when theres nothing to be done  im not so sure the marlboroughs have got a divorce  and you still see them around  but sunny marlborough has no official post  he hasnt been in office since the war  while you must have susan next to you under the tropical sun  shell do it well  she can teach diplomacy to experts  but  we dont like each other  how can i help mr branson  i was thinking  its just  yes  i thought id come down for supper tonight  catch up with your news  if you would like to of course youd be very welcome  we dont eat late while the familys away  so dinner will be at about eight oclock  ill see you then  fains i tell mr carson  how tiny the glens make one feel  that is the thing about nature  theres so much of it  must be lovely to be queen of such a kingdom  youre right were very lucky in this  goodness  we werent expecting male company for our feasting  im sorry to disappoint you  how did you get on  very well not too long a trail  and death by a single shot at the end of it  nield is cockahoop well done papa  your reward will be to join the ladies lunch  an added bonus i hope its venison  quite right we ought to eat what we kill  stop talking nonsense and tell mccree to lay two more places   and nothing to show for it  perhaps its a parable of life  reminds me of the trenches rather  hours of inching through mud with no discernible purpose  rumble of thunder  why dont you come flyfishing tomorrow  we might see a bit more activity  you could bring your evening clothes to change at duneagle  thats rather an imposition  thats what youre here for isnt it  to get to know us all  and you didnt bring your tails all this way to dine in a country pub  no  no i suppose not  peal of thunder  have you got a minute  because if you havent its perfectly fine  a minute for what  her ladyship would like a word  what does she want with me  well what do you think  she wants to make a fuss like she always does  rumble of thunder  this is so kind of you  obrien milady  obrien its just that wilkins here isnt quite able to understand  what im getting at when im describing lady granthams hair  i understand milady its just  could you help her  youll know exactly what i mean  oh er  well its a question of body milady  you need more volume to begin before you sculpt it so to speak  i knew youd have the answer  if i could oh please please please  wilkins pay close attention to what shes doing  yes your ladyship  bombay that sounds rather modest for a marquis  well no not if its a step towards the viceroys crown  i dont know about that all i do know is its going to be very hot  and all the costumes of imperial rule  are always so peculiarly unsuited to the climate  will you take rose i dont think we should  but susan wont discuss it  unless you want her married to a thirdrate colonial official  with no money and bad teeth susan had better think again  just as he stood a gust of wind comes into the corrie from behind us  a hind got our scent and they were away  really darling its boring enough to hear about when you succeed  what did you think of michael  he seems like a nice chap were going fishing tomorrow  hes had such a lot to put up with  oh god not one of your hardluck cases is he  why must you sound so heartless  actually i think india would be fascinating  but i know that mummy and i would drive each other mad  you mustnt be too hard on your mother  you know its natural for her to be concerned  concerned  is that what she is  im sure she loves you very much  whats this  rose was just saying how nice your hair looks tonight  hes what  its only meant to be friendly  knock at door  good evening mr carson  i dont expect you to approve  well now come along in  i hope you wont show an example of rudeness to the younger staff  i was hoping to catch you  what about a glass of something  no i wont stay but ive had an idea  i saw mrs hughes in the village today  and she told me the servants have got up a party for the thirsk fair  and erm i was wondering if youd like to go  what with the servants no of course not  but i could drive us over for an hour or two  im told they do it well  why not  it might be fun  good ill come for you at five  know what youre going to wear nothing good thats for sure  ill keep an eye on the place  oh dont say youre not coming  ii thought you could drive us  there is no need for impertinence edna thank you  youre all right im happy to drive them  but wholl stay here i will  you dont want to come to the fair  i would sooner chew broken glass  it was lovely milady  but what about you did you enjoy your day  oh i was stupid to go to the picnic  we were shaken about in that trap like dice in a cup  stay in bed for the morning  and take it easy at the ball  are you looking forward to it  i am rather ive been planning a bit of a surprise for mr bates  why what sort of surprise  no its a surprise for you too  dont forget what i said  what was that  just that ive promised to rest tomorrow  which is annoying because id rather come out with you  and interrogate mr gregson  is he going to propose  i think so but hes quite opaque  a man of mystery  edith could use some of that  you are horrid when you want to be  i know but you love me dont you  madly  hums  and the man on your right  and  and then round in a figure of eight  hums  both laugh  you take it easy with mr barrow today  i dont mean crawl all over him  but dont spoil things  youre a fine one to talk  who rang the police in the first place  sod this im bushed  suppose someone comes in  theyll find a man sitting in an armchair  theyll survive it  sniggers  funny thing with mr barrow is he wont hear a bad word about you  why what have i done  i only meant he wont let anyone speak against you  what on earth is going on in here  we were just  you were just taking advantage of the cats absence  well see what mr carson has to say  mrs hughes  mr branson  what time are we leaving about half past four  but mr stark can easily drive us  because im so high and mighty  youre part of the family now  theres nothing false in that  i know  i hope you do  because if someone is trying to make you feel awkward  theyre in the wrong not you  ill be there at half past four  waltz plays  i said id meet him at his stall  whats that he asked me to bring sandwiches  can i come i want to find out where the best food stalls

there was a job to be done and we both believed in it  sighs then the children came along  and for years we hardly had time to think  what went wrong  first james left then annabel got married  we started to learn just how little we have in common  why is susan so hard on rose  who knows  perhaps rose reminds her of me as i used to be  me when i had something to live for  oh you have a great deal to live for  duneagle i cant remember being as envious  as i have been these past few days  dont be itll all have to go  what  its my own fault  if id had any gumption and modernised as you did  but i sat on my hands as the money drained away  now its all gone  what will you do  go to india first and then london  oh itll be all right  what with the club and the lords  susan and i neednt see too much of each other  shrimpie my dear chap im so sorry  question is rose  what are we going to do about rose  lively music  anna come on this is it  this is what youll see quick come on  look at anna she never said she could reel  bates did you know  no milady i never knew  but isnt she marvellous  yes  she is marvellous  oh mrs patmore how kind of you  i want a word so i thought we could have some tea while i get it  you were right  he says he loves me and he cant live without me  pours tea  oh dear  what do you mean oh dear  its a long time since anyone wanted to share my  seat on the bus never mind my heart and home  i dont know how to say it  well find a way  well i first noticed it when i was standing at the stall  he was flirting with that young assistant  and stroking her well bottom  what its true  then i saw him making eyes at some other women  when he was pulling in the tugofwar  while i was cheering him later when i was with alfred  i saw mr tufton in the crowd  and he seemed to be chewing the mouth off some poor woman  where was i all this time  i dont know  dreaming of a better life  oh mrs patmore i am sorry  i dont know if he wanted to eat a few dinners  before he told you the truth  or if he planned to marry you and chain you to the stove  either way it was the cooking he was after  and not me  i feel terrible  i should have pulled you away then and there  but you were having such a good time  is there anything i can do  no  god ive never felt more relieved in all my life  what  the more he said about how he liked his beef roasted his eggs fried  and his pancakes flipped the more i wondered how to get away  and what if he comes back  hell get a thick ear and no mistake  but how could he do such a thing mrs hughes  how could he lead a poor woman on like that  sighs  you heard him mrs patmore any time any place  he loves to be in love  both giggle  and that was really his reaction  how disappointing  well i wasnt going to tell you till i was leaving  why not  because i i  i wanted us to have a last evening together  this is not our last evening  isnt it its odd  if youd asked me before tonight how i felt about you  im not sure what i would have answered  but now im absolutely sure and this is not our last evening  band strikes up  haha  whoops  what in gods name  laughs hysterically  are you proud of your handiwork  i dont know what you mean  never mind miss wilkins  it might do him good to let it all go for once  and im grateful i am  what for  because i need never be held back by any sense of loyalty to you  molesley laughs hysterically  they do say theres a wild man inside all of us  if only he would stay inside  i thought youd like to know mr barrow is feeling much better  thank you but you should go now  just wanted to tell you what a lovely day ive had  really lovely  do you want to meet for lunch tomorrow in the grantham arms  are you all right  dance ends  i dont think i should have done that but i couldnt resist  this is just what i was afraid of calm down everythings fine  but i wonder would you mind terribly if i went home tomorrow  of course not ill tell shrimpie tonight  no not you you must stay here  what i dont want to let you out of my sight  if you come mama and papa will leave and the party will break up  so what im coming with you  its unfair on susan and shrimpie im perfectly all right  its only a couple more days  let me go and ill see you when i see you  please  besides molesley may need a bit of time before hes fit to travel  snores  that was mr bates on the telephone  lady mary and anna are coming back today  theyre already on the train  well wed better look sharp edna air the room and make up the bed  while i go and talk to mrs patmore  must i  why  do you have other plans edna  i said id meet tom branson for lunch in the village  did you indeed  tom branson  before you start it may not be his fault  whether its his fault or not she has to go  oh yes  of course she has to go  will you tell him or will i  youd better do it id only be rude which wouldnt help anyone  youve heard about mary  i have her maid left a message with obrien  i hope you dont think her rude  i know you havent always approved of mary  shes having a baby  we all need a little leeway when it comes to our babies  and as for the other business im not as harsh as i was  rose is proving quite an education  i can imagine  i find myself worrying about rose  before i even open my eyes for the morning  do you think im being stupid  not at all i understand better than anyone else here could  shrimpie wants her to live at downton while were in india  ive told robert i would never agree to that against your wishes  i know thank you  its not often that i get support in this house  but i wonder now if he isnt right  and that we need a rest from one another  apart from anything else i cant bring her out from bombay  but would you be prepared for all that  if you want me to be and only if you want it  what about you and shrimpie  oh well soldier on  our sort never accept defeat  even if i wish we could  will you speak well of me to her  not every day but sometimes  course i will i promise  so i spoiled things for her  im afraid the work would no longer satisfy her  ive seen it before  shed unsettle the other maids  i didnt encourage her you know  maybe but if i may say it you didnt discourage her either  can i ask one thing  that you give her a decent reference please  i will though i dont think shes cut out to be a housemaid  would you allow me to speak as i would have in the old days  go on then  you let edna make you ashamed of your new life  but youve done well  and lady sybil would be so proud  i cant bear to be without her  sobs  you must bear it  and one day i hope and so would she  youll find someone to bear it with you  but until then be your own master and call your own tune  thank you  milady is something the matter  i dont want to alarm anyone but will you leave the cases  and take me straight to the hospital  milady what  let mrs crawley know and get a message to mr crawley straight away  mr crawley  sighs mr crawley  what in gods name  right all change the whole family is coming back tomorrow  and we must be ready to receive them  is it because lady marys in the hospital it is  does that mean shes in danger no it doesnt mean any such thing  lady mary will be perfectly fine but we have to make allowances  now do you have everything  what have i done wrong  im as good as mr branson  and there was nothing improper nothing at all  im sure  but there are rules to this way of life edna  and if youre not prepared to live by them  then its not the right life for you  its organised weve got tickets for the first train in the morning  there isnt one before then i just wish i was there with her  i cant wait to get home  arent you enjoying your victorian idyll any longer  im glad i was jealous of shrimpie  its made me realise what a fool ive been  downton will survive because of matthews vision  im so pleased to hear you say it  you always knew how lucky we are in matthew  and now i give thanks for him  as i give thanks for my home and my family  and most of all i give thanks for my wife  send us the news as soon as you know it  and thank you for taking in rose  well make firm plans when we know when were leaving  im glad to have her now i know its what you both want  what i want is for her to know that family can be a loving thing  well do our best  love is like riding or speaking french  if you dont learn it young  its hard to get the trick of it later  well said shrimpie and good luck  what did you tell mary about michael gregson  nothing  i hope you made it clear what has to happen  oh yes we both know what happens next  ill see you at downton very soon and thank you both so much  we look forward to it  are we all ready bates we are my lord  engine starts up  mr carson im going down to the

wont want him in the room till its all over trust me  oh  it wont be long now  we must ring carson hell be in such a state i will  i shouldnt have gone up north how could i be so stupid  my dear the baby will be perfectly well  slightly early but not very  well just have to take a little extra care thats all  knocking  knock at door  what are you doing up here  i just wanted to make sure there wasnt too much harm done  well there was enough harm done  you were brave mr barrow  very brave  i feel badly  i shouldnt have run off  oh you should have  otherwise what was i bloody doing it for  were you following me  i had to keep an eye out  i could see youd had a bit to drink  so  yes  yes i did follow you  why  you know why  i can never give you what you want  i understand that i do  and
