                wait one moment  she can decide whether or not she wants to throw these away  quite right  but how would it be funded  theres quite a lot in the kitty and wed have another campaign  therell be plenty of volunteers to keep up standards  for how long and what about the cricket  wed have to resite the pitch my lord of course it would take work   but weve got until the summer  think what were gaining  a beautiful garden of remembrance  where people can walk and sit and think about their loved ones  they can come here from all around  and spend an hour with their sacred memories in peace and at rest  this pitch has been prepared over years  with a great deal of work for the cricket  that field below peckham wood could be made into a pitch  surely the right place is in the village where people pass every day  will it be peaceful and quiet a fit place for mourning  its what theyre doing in sowerby and im certain its where most of them will be  and is our memorial to be no better than most of them  it comes down to priorities lord grantham  which is more important a game of cricket or the loss of a son in the course of his duty  well this is it then  theres something i wanna say  im sorry i put you through all that trouble  forget it   its in tpast  well youve been a good friend to me thomas  if anyone had told me that id have been friends with a  man like you id have not believed them  but we have been friends  and im sad to see the back of you i am  we can always write  im not much at letter writing ill do me best  but in case we dont meet again  i hope you find some happiness  i do truly  i hope the same for you too jimmy  ill be dandy  id best be off   im sorry jimmys gone  i know  it were nice having a bonny face about the house  well have to make do with mr molesley  how are you studies going   slowly  its bound to be hard when youve not been at school for a while  its not hard its impossible  but whats the answer  is the pudding ready to go up   mrs patmore the pudding  sorry i was miles away  theres a sauce to go with that  on one tray or will mr barrow help  one tray please i cant be bothered to fight with him  jimmy where are you when we need you   ooh mr carson  what is it now  now that jimmy erm james has gone  do i take it that i am now first footman  since you are the only footman you are first second third and last  make what you will of it  mr moseley we are nearly at the end of those distinctions  there will come a time when a household is lucky to boast any footman  now get that up to the dining room  did it not go well this morning  i was disappointed if you must know  but its early days  george is coming on so fast  its wonderful how they seem to change week by week at his age  hes rather sweet isnt he  how are you getting on with repairing the fire damage  oh theyre all being marvellous but i do feel such an idiot  maybe because you behaved like an idiot  the good thing is itll be sorted out in a day or two   i got this letter from charles blake  what does he want  an art historian he knows is writing a book on della francesca  he wasnt aware we had one of his paintings at downton  hes desperate to see it  i assume its just an excuse so charles can pay court to mary  he doesnt want to come he wrote to introduce his friend simon bricker   i can invite charles if youd like  i dont mind either way  i will ask him we dont know mr bricker it might be easier if charles was here   dont forget im away from tuesday  i wish i knew where you were going  i havent a clue i expect well drive around for a few days  and stop and sketch when we see a view we like   whos this with  annabelle portsmouth itll be fun  how was your morning papa have you decided where to put the memorial   no  carson  not yet my lady  its difficult to please everyone  bella davis telephoned to talk about her work with russian refugees in york   are there many russian refugees in york  im afraid so  theyre scattered all over europe  trying to establish communities to save their culture after the ravages of revolution  ghastly for them eh tom  i feel sorry for anyone exiled from their own country  i pity those who stayed behind  only to be tortured and murdered in their thousands  leave him alone papa  i was at the hospital today  and mrs henderson has done the most generous thing  and given a wireless to the ward so that they can listen to music and the news  and sometimes even a play i cant tell you how it brightens things up  im told that theyre far more efficient now   and much easier to tune  no   buti havent asked anything  no  shall we go through and let the servants get in here  hello  dawn raid  look who it is come on my lady  hello mrs drewe  i hope im not being a nuisance  hello darling  hello how are you  why dont you sit there my lady  have they started cleaning up after the fire  theyre doing it now thank heaven it was only my room  god i was stupid  its wonderful the interest you take in her my lady  perhaps youll keep an eye on her as she grows  im sure i will  it would be a blessing if you would  after all shes almost a foundling no parents of her own   no family noone to turn to  what are you saying  were her family now  i know but theres a limit to what we can do with three of our own  i dont understand you marigold is one of our own   or very nearly  all im saying is her ladyship could prove to be a real blessing  if shed only take an interest  she seems a bright little thing to me   well id have to think about it  course you will  because if people get used to seeing you together you cant just duck out  thats why we must think carefully and only take it on if im sure  you could be a sort of godmother  thats it   yes i could be marigolds godmother  shes got a godmother  we had her christened and my sisters   talk it over with his lordship why dont you   see what he thinks  maybe i could take her up to the house to visit my niece and nephew  my eye how lucky would she be  it is all very good of you my lady im sure  give it a thought then well see   sorry  dr clarkson has just been telling me about the latest report of the drug insulin   oh  its going to make a great difference to many lives   im quite sure of that  i agree  were a backwater here but heaven knows weve our share of diabetes  a diagnosis will no longer be a death sentence  im glad to see your old interests are reasserting themselves   why do you say that  mrs crawleys been distracted lately  with lord merton frisking around her skirts and getting in the way  you make too much of it  do i weve been invited to tea with lord merton at cavenham  i opened the letter this morning  maybe youre the real quarry and hes only hunting me to throw you off the scent  i may be older than i was but i can still tell when a man is interested  i believe cavenham park has some beautiful gardens  though its the wrong time of year to see them  the promise of the gardens in summer will be the final worm on the hook  honestly im as good at being teased as the next man  but even my sense of humour has its limits  off you go miss goody two shoes  you can play the holy mother all you like you still nearly got me sacked  leave her alone  oh gallant mr molesley shes never told you though has she  miss baxter has had troubles in the past  which you tried to use against her until her ladyship put a stop to it   that is all i need to know  i knew she hadnt told you  barrow could you please tell mrs patmore im here  very good my lady  mrs patmore lady rose  a delicious dinner mrs patmore  thank you very much  you wanted a word  only if its convenient my lady but you know that young woman who works at the school   miss bunting mr bransons friend  yes i didnt like to ask him in case he found it awkward  i was wondering if she might be prepared to take on some extra work  but suppose they telephone lady portsmouth  shes promised shell cover for me  i feel quite nervous and im not even going  well choose the clothes carefully so you can take them on and off without my help  well ill have his help  honestly my lady youd better hope i never write my memoirs  there is one thing ive got to ask you   im really sorry but i must  go on  i have to sure there arent anyconsequences  what sort of consequences  well you know  no i dont  oh my god er  i mean i beg your pardon my lady  but you see i cant just go into a shop and buy something  what if i were recognised  but i wouldnt know what to buy  ive thought of that  i have a copy of marie stopess book  it tells you everything  well wont he take care of it  i dont think one should rely on a man in that department do you   but suppose im recognised  but you wont be  and even if you are youre married  with a living husband  why shouldnt you buy one  is it true that lady rose wants his lordship to buy a wireless  whether he will or nots another matter  i like the idea of a wireless  to hear people singing and talking in london and all sorts  whats so good about that when you can go to a music hall in york  id rather hear a live singer  if youre looking for miss baxter shes still upstairs  why do you have to make everything sound so nasty  im nasty about miss baxter because she came here to help me and shes broken her word  i doubt thats how shed put it  do you think with her past shed come near a house like this  shed be lucky to get work in a public laundry   im sure shes grateful  then shes a funny way of showing it  you do know shes a thief  stole her mistresses jewels  there must be more to it than that  no she sneaked up to the bedroom snatched up the pieces  pearl necklaces diamond bracelets put them in her pockets  then tried to make it look as if someone had broken in   she was obviously unsuccessful  they gave her five years but she only served three  came out a few months before i brought her up here so dont say she doesnt owe me   has mrs bates come down yet  not yet  we were just discussing your friend miss baxter  is she my friend particularly  she seems to think so  i know you mean to lead me into further inquiry but i couldnt care less what you think thomas   on that subject or any other  i agree  no you dont  cos you listened to the story didnt you  what was that about  oh nothing  i must remember to organise a car to meet charles blake and his friend   theyll be here at teatime  are we a hotel that never presents a bill  youve already made that joke   there you are i need your advice  how flattering what is it   should i go  no no its not a secret  ive been talking to mr drewe did you know theyve taken in a child   the daughter of a friend who died  how kind of them  the girl is very endearing and i think id like to be involved in her future to help her in some way  maybe with school fees or something  ive money from my articles and grandpapas trust  has drewe put you up to this  no but id like to take an active interest  itd be good for me  its your money do what you like with it  but you cant just give the child up when you get bored  i wont get bored  cousin robert did you see this article about how wirelesses are getting cheaper and more reliable   no  i just thought it was interesting  no  whats mr bransons pal doing down here  why dont you approve  last time she came she gave them all an earful  i cannot solve the mystery how are you getting on with the memorial  his lordship is resisting the idea of the garden   you dont agree with him  well as it happens i do   what  i dont believe in your garden of remembrance  in a town maybe  but the yorkshire scenery is our garden of remembrance  id prefer to see a memorial at the heart of village life so wed pass it on the way to church or the shop   and give a thought to the boys who fell  you surprise me mrs hughes  i was disappointed in his lordship but im more disappointed in you  every relationship has its ups and downs  yes miss  erm  is there a lady i could deal with  very good madam if youll just wait there  ive not quite made up my mind why not serve the gentleman first  thats kind of you packet of safety razor blades please   thats sixpence sir  thank you  if we keep this up well have another customer along soon  yes erm  i would like to buy  one of these  i can see youre married   i am married yes  but you dont with for any more children  thats it thats right  there is always abstinence  of course there is but  i dont want to take any risks because of my health  oh i see well that does put a slightly different colour on it  three and eleven   keep the change  what about the instructions   they can be very difficult to manage  im sure its perfect thank you  ill take half a crown a lesson thats five shillings a week  you can use my sitting room if you need somewhere private  see you after school goodbye  wait a minute that is daisys busiest time   i cant come any earlier  oh well then perhaps   im excited  but ill pay its not right that you should waste your money on me   no i want to pay  thats a nice thing youre doing  is it well i think ive been a damn fool and doubled me workload  i wondered who was in here  were just sorting out some things for roses refugees  poor rose  why are you so against getting a wireless  i wish shed just say it cousin robert please buy a wireless for downton   i wouldnt mind  thats because youre american  i find the whole idea a kind of thief of life  people waste hours huddled around a box listening to someone burbling inanities from somewhere else  but surely now with the latest news  and it must be a boon for the old what do you think bates  i cant see the dowager with a wireless my lady  its a fad it wont last  oh no not that one  this is nice  lord grantham said it was the coldest house in yorkshire  ah youre here im so pleased   how charming it is  oh we do our best  i know its the wrong time of year but i would love to see the gardens  shouldnt we allow lord merton to tell us how hes planned our visit   of course  it is his house  yes i know that  youve been very quiet all day   have i  i wish youd tell me what it is  very well  last night mr barrow chose to give me an account of your history  he was bound to sooner or later  his version is a bleak one which will not surprise you   what did he say  well for a start he seemed to suggest  that you were in some sort ofprivileged position  i was a trusted senior ladies maid to a good woman  in a rich and respectable household  but then he said thatyou just took your employers jewels  snatched them up and put them into your pocket  i stole a pearl necklace with a ruby clasp  two diamond bracelets and four rings  did he tell you i tried to pretend it was a burglary  well then i think you have all the relevant information  there must be something more  there must have been a cause a reason for you to do such a thing   what sort of cause  i dont know someone that you cared for  needed money for an emergency and you were desperate to help  i was a common thief mr molesley a convicted criminal a jailbird   i dont believe you  because you dont want to  i would only say that i am not that person now  when youve finished your tea we can walk the terraces if you like  that sounds ideal  i recently read a book on the science of quarantine  and ive been looking forward to discussing it with you  we mustnt bore lady grantham  oh youre right you see i need your guiding hand to keep me in check  mrs crawley is never happier than when she has a chance to use her guiding hand  are you dear   how pretty this room is  thank you  mama redid all these rooms in the 80s she had good taste i think  is one allowed to brag about ones mother  so the late lady merton didnt change it  ada didnt use it much  she thought it was draughty being so near the front door  i suppose she had a point  if you dont like being quite so near the front door  well i think its enchanting  its a womans room though  of course  the library and the dining room are masculine  the drawing rooms and the music rooms are feminine or so i was taught  i meant that it needs a womans presence to make sense of it  when im on my own in here i feel like a bull in a china shop   why arent you going with her  what  with lady mary shell be away for almost a week  yes but theyre driving round they dont know where theyll stay or anything   she and lady portsmouth  yes  it doesnt sound like lady mary  it sounds a bit bohemian  i suppose shes allowed to get away from it all if she wants to   like anyone  yes i suppose she is  what do you make of ediths burst of generosity with the drewe girl  in all probability her beloved gregson is dead and she has to sit and watch her sisters children play  she wants someone to love its as simple as that  the problem will come when she has a child of her own to distract her  lets cross that bridge when we come to it  and lets hope the drewes dont get sick of her in the meantime   was it ghastly  i didnt know where to look  but when i thought about it afterwards it seemed unfair to punish me like that  suppose i had eight children and didnt want any more wouldnt i have the right   i agree completely  i feel like going back and ordering a bakers dozen  ones enough for now   mr bricker  this is wonderfully kind of you  you can see the painting now or after dinner or wait until tomorrow its entirely up to you  i think id like a glimpse of it later this evening  i can take a proper look in the daylight with my wits about me  you look as if youve spent the winter away from these shores   ive been in alexandria  really i dont envy you   im not very good at abroad  shes in the kitchen  i dont know what room shes in she was giving a lesson to daisy and shes still here  shouldnt we invite her to dinner as shes your friend  i dont think lord grantham would like it not after last time  but it seems terribly grand and unfriendly not to ill ask cora  how are you i havent seen you for ages  have i neglected you im sorry  no need to apologise although i think you might perhaps have told me i was not the lucky winner   why would you say that  because its perfectly obvious  well i dont seem to have broken your heart  you sound disappointed  who is this fellow anyway  simon bricker just a chap i know  he was talking about his book in boodles   i mentioned the painting here and that was it  hes very brown lucky chap  charles im sorry if ive hurt you  its just only lately that ive started to come out of the mist  and the mist is clearing around the lithe and supple figure of tony gillingham   maybe  well good luck to you both  i mean it  thats why i came here so i could wish you luck in person   we should give her the option  if youre certain   i dont want to feel im imposing  dont be silly this is your home   wheres tom going  miss bunting is downstairs   what  shes been teaching one of the maids in the kitchen   toms gone to ask if shed like some dinner  youre not serious  shes the first friend toms made that has nothing to do with us and we must respect that  so every time we entertain we must invite this tinpot rosa luxemburg  whos she  a german communist who was shot and thrown in the canal  we wouldnt wish that on miss bunting  i didnt see the time ive left mrs patmore cooking for everyone  tell her from me youll prove a talented mathematician  whose idea was it to ask me yours  no it was rose although its a new sensation for me not to be alone in my opinions at the table  if ive encouraged you to stand your ground im glad  but i dont feel like putting either myself or lord grantham through another test of strength  please thank them and say good night for me  i dont need a car im perfectly happy to walk  when in rome  but do you ever think you might have been in rome too long   why do you say that  you neednt always do what the romans do   theres more in you than that  i wonder  you could do anything you want if you put your mind to it  i cant deny it its good to hear you talk as if i had a real future  you do have a future but not here  not with these people  your link to them is cybil but from the way you talk i think she was unique in this family   free of prejudice free from narrow thinking  thats true enough   she was unique  i just want you to remember that you are the man  who tempted her over the park wall to run away to freedom  i was that man  but im not sure i can be that man again  you can be i know it  good night  wheres your friend  she couldnt stay she had to get home  what a relief  what were you doing in alexandria  escaping the winter and looking at beautiful things  beautiful and very ancient things   i dont agree  so youre collecting clothes for the russian refugees  i said no at first because well it didnt feel terribly me  but then i thought about them leading their lives before the fall   doing everything you would do  exactly  dancing and shopping and seeing their friends and then suddenly  being thrown out to fend for themselves in the jungle  well i thought i had to help if i could  its lucky miss bunting refused our invitation or shed give tell us  how theyre aristocrats and they deserve it  she believes the old regime was unjust  she hopes the new system will be an improvement does that make her a firebrand because i agree with her  and you dont think certain acts of savagery forfeit sympathy for the perpetrators  it was terrible of course but the english killed king charles the first  to create a balance between the throne and parliament   i didnt kill him personally  i didnt shoot the imperial family  goodness is this what they call a lively exchange of views  its about now that papa usually fetches his gun  mary dont tease mr bricker hes come to see a painting  and finds himself in the middle of a civil war  i dont think well split tonight   theyll only fight if we do  you want to see the picture and delay is torment  you read my mind  carson how are we to move forward with the memorial  i suppose your position has not changed  i can see that im losing i would rather be convinced than defeated my lord  and i am not yet convinced  cousin robert  did you see that the king is going to speak on the wireless   it was in the paper today  dont be silly  no its true for the opening of the british empire exhibition  its being broadcast on the 23rd i just thought youd like to know   is this true carson  i believe so my lord  talking about the empire too i wonder  if the king wants to use the wireless to speak to his people maybe we have to listen  i wouldnt say that my lord  is it not a case of the king being forced into accepting a humiliating assignment by his ministers   are you saying the king is a weak man carson  never that my lord  but even kings must bow to pressure sometimes  and should we not support him in his hour of endurance  oh cheer up we can always hire one  surely we wont be corrupted if its only in the house for a day  they said you were out here  i thought id get some air before we have our dinner  ive let you down havent i  no i wouldnt say so  you are who you are  you made choices and you paid the price for them  still im not who you thought me  it is not for me to pass sentence  youve had enough of that  ive changed  im different now i wish you could believe me  but you wont tell me why you did it  because i am not persuaded you could have acted on your own  maybe not but i dont want to talk about that  because alone or not in the end i made the choice to steal  and theres no point trying to pass the sin along  then you wont allow me an opinion  you see you wouldnt have done it no matter who asked you to  no matter what the provocation  i dont claim that if a man must watch his loved ones starve  whos to say what hell do  but i wasnt starving was i  believe me  id give a limb to rewrite that whole chapter of my life  but i cant mr molesley  even for you  i cant  do you have a clear record of how it came to be here  the second earl was our collector  he bought it when he was quite a young man on his grand tour   which was when  1789 weve a letter from his mother  shes heard about the fall of the bastille and her son was going through france  she sent it by special messenger   mothers  some things never change  lots of things never change  tomorrow i can show you some other pictures he brought back if you have time  i have all the time in the world i should enjoy it very much   theres coffee in the drawing room  thank you  well be right in  isis come here girl  i cant believe it when she explained how it all worked   i could see it at once  well this is our lady of the numbers  if id had a teacher like her things might have turned out different  theyve not turned out so badly have they  im glad to see some smiles at the end of a long day  daisys singing the praises of miss bunting and her teaching  i should keep it to yourself shes not a favourite with mr carson   why whats she done  its not what shes done its what he calls her dangerous ideas  dangerous or not im sure theyre good ideas  careful hell think youve been infected   whats this  daisys worried shes been infected with a cold from the delivery boy  oh his lordship and i are walking down to the village tomorrow to look at possible sites  erm i dont like it when were not on the same side  were different people mr carson we cant always agree  i know  but i dont like it  i cant make a decision baxter until you tell me the whole truth  i have my lady  i dont mean you tried to shield yourself quite the contrary  to be honest i dont know why i havent dismissed you out of hand  i employ a jewel thief to look after my jewels it doesnt make sense   i dont know what to say  i should sack you for just concealing it  should i take this as my dismissal  i dont know i dont know why not but i dont know  what was the matter with tom  papa will blame his friend miss bunting for filling his ears with poison but im not sure   he has so little life away from us  hes had no life since cybil died  but ive a feeling hes turning back into who he really is   is that a bad thing  for us maybe but not for him  well im going up good night you two  do you think theres a chance cousin robert might get a wireless  well if he wont get one for the king your cause is hopeless  thats true  i loved roses definition of ordinary life  dancing and shopping and seeing ones friends  im going to bed too  im worn out  but i hope youll be happy for me if it is tony in the end  nothing will make me happier than seeing you happy  but please be absolutely sure before you decide   why do you say that  because youre cleverer than he is  that might have worked in the last century  when ladies had to hide their brains behind good manners and breeding   but not now  i dont agree i think tony is quite as clever as i am  then one of us is right and one is wrong  im not some overheated housemaid drooling over a photograph of douglas fairbanks  plantagenets are as susceptible as housemaids when it comes to sex  are we talking about sex or love  that is a question mankind has wrestled with since the dawn of time  good night  poor tom hes nothing more than a ventriloquist dummy  for that terrible womans ideas to come spewing out of his mouth  maybe shes given him confidence to say what he really thinks  not to sit in silence listening to a thousands things he disagrees with  shell steal him away from us shes pulling him back to the other side  i hope not but if he feels he has to go thats what he must do   well hes not taking sybbie  dont be silly  i mean it i am not having cybils only child  snatched from everyone she loves  to be brought up by some harpie in an american sewer  if the time comes then we will talk to tom  and i suggest we try to be a little more calm about it  for heavens sake cant i be angry when our eldest grandchild  is about to be stolen from us for ever  and tell your friend bricker to stop flirting with isis  there is nothing more illbred than trying to steal the affections of someones elses dog  very well ill tell him  to stop flirting  i think ive put everything in   your packets here my lady  thank you  i dont think theres anything too difficult to fasten  lord gillingham can always help  are you certain you know what youre doing  i believe so  anna the way things are going  life will be lived in much closer quarters in future  my grandparents lived in vast rooms surrounded by staff  if they disagreed theyd hardly have known it  but it wont be like that for us  i must be sure im right to want this man  as my friend  as my lover  as my husband  well i think its a big risk  please i cant be lectured twice in one evening  ive already had a ticking off from mr blake   you didnt tell him  only that i thought lord gillingham was the one  the point is i want to marry again  and i absolutely dont want to divorce  well i wish you luck my lady   morning  morning  there you are im afraid its the perfect position for me  millions of men killed my lord and well remember them  with a stone cross for women to stop by and gossip  i prefer to say that as people go about their business we remind them of the men who died  they gave their lives for our freedom and well remember them with  a convenient step to sit for a moment and tie up your shoelace   afternoon my lord  hello mrs elkith what are you up to  im just waiting for our robbie  he likes to say hello to his father sometimes after school  its good of you to make a special journey  oh no he comes with me when im on the way to the shop  or the post office and takes a chance to visit the grave then  my bob was a lovely man and a wonderful dad and i dont want our robbie to forget him  not if i can help it  no no of course you dont  thank you mrs elkith your words have made quite an impression on me  dont you agree carson  i do yes quite an impression  my lord  why is it called a wireless when theres so many wires  i dont know  nothings happening  its just warming up my lady  music  is that jack hylton  oh golly isnt this thrilling  whats this i see  servants loitering in the hall with her ladyship due at any moment  look at that if i touch it will i get a shock  youll only get a shock if you listen to it  i think its exciting were catching up mr carson  whether you like it or not downton is catching up with the times we lived in  that is exactly what i am afraid of  hello  before i go i hope were all united in the plan   its very kind of you my lady isnt it margie  very kind  i just want every opportunity for little marigold   its very generous  and you wont mind me being part of her life   she needs a chance to dream  you mustnt fill her head with too many dreams my lady  this is a wonderful opportunity youre offering thank you  ill see you soon   byebye  bye   whats the matter  why should anything be the matter  you could have been more gracious  i dont want this place to be her dolls house  and marigold her doll to be kissed and petted  and cast aside when she loses interest   she wont lose interest  how can you be sure  i am sure  ill be in the yard tell me when the foods ready  hands please  it gives me the greatest pleasure and satisfaction  to come here today with the queen  for the purpose of opening the british empire exhibition   i suppose he cant hear us  no it doesnt work like that  the board of management  miss mary crawley  welcome to liverpool miss crawley i hope you enjoy your stay  im sure i will  national anthem  well you have heard the voice of his majesty king george v  what do you think carson mrs hughes the king on the wireless  i prefer to think of him on his throne my lord  to me its a good thing to make him less of a myth more of a man  well i hope youve all taken something of value from it  mrs hughes is right the radio somehow makes the king more real  the monarchy has thrived on magic and mystery  strip them away and people may think the royal family is just like us  well would that be so wrong  well only if they want to stay at buckingham palace  it was as though he was right in the room with us  cheer up mr barrow  werent you pleased to hear the king  i expect its difficult for you with jimmy gone  we all need a special friend from time to time  i wasnt special to him not truly  i dont agree i think he liked you  maybe a little  but i dont think im very likeable to people here  do you want to be  there are times when id like to belong  does that sound funny  not to me not at all  shall i have it collected in the morning my lord   must he  do we need to get rid of it in quite such a hurry now its here   put it in the small library  thank you for changing your mind  i wasnt aware id decided against it  you can clear this for now  its such a pity mary had to miss it for a boring sketching trip  knock at door  its mad not to give a false name  always make a lie as truthful as possible  if youre seen you have the right name youre alone in your room  and why shouldnt you be in liverpool  how did you manage to get the rooms connected  well im not a complete halfwit  nor happily is the manager  so whats the plan  its a simple one well go down to church street for a delicious dinner  after which well come back  andmake love  exactly  well make love all night  and in fact for as long as either of us has any stamina left  and who can say fairer than that  i meant to ask how you got on this morning  oh weve settled it  its going to
