                baby crying  flames crackle  crows cawing  bell chimes  ill have to go of course you must go  oh but wholl give the letter to her ladyship  oh i can do that and ill take her breakfast and dress her today  but i havent got time to make it a regular thing  no i can do it until she finds someone else lady mary wont mind  whats the matter with you miss obriens upped and left  never  jimmy  jimmy miss obriens gone  jimmy what gone where how should i know  madge obriens gone  maid 1 have you heard maid 2 heard what  maid 1 miss obrien shes gone maid 2 what do you mean gone  shes left left  shes packed up  excited chattering  i cant believe it  i can sneaking off like a thief in the night thats obrien to a t  i just cant believe susan has done this to me  miss obrien did say that she got on very well with lady flintshire  when she was up in scotland  so i gather  lady flintshire has booked my ticket for india  and it seems too good a chance to miss  was there really no warning  now i think of it shed a telegram yesterday  that must have been it  so what happens now  ill dress you today mlady  and anna will take over tomorrow until you find a replacement  and she really gave no clue  she didnt say anything to me mr carson not a word  as long as she didnt  i know you all think she must have said summat but she didnt  i believe you thousands wouldnt  she may be my aunt but shes a dark horse  noone will contradict you there  chattering  susan flintshire has stolen mamas maid  whilst her daughters a guest in this house  im sure she wouldnt put it like that  i dont care how she puts it its absolutely disgraceful  its all right madge told me it is not all right  did you have any idea no not really  i knew i knew that mummy thought obrien was very good at doing hair  and they talked about her wanting to travel  what when when you were all at duneagle  and you didnt think to inform us  im in london tomorrow i can put an advertisement in the lady  good  wont it take forever waiting for the magazine to come out  it cant be helped  were meeting trent at eleven  ill see you there i want to walk the plantations first  i was wondering if mary might like to come  dont bother mary shes got enough on her plate  did you really not know anything  door closes  i never thought shed go through with it  i thought you might like to take this down with you  in case you want a walk its quite chilly  wheres the black one  knock at door  baby gurgles  im taking master george out for some air mlady  and i wondered if youd like to come with us  i dont think so but thank you  poor little orphan  thank you nanny  hes not an orphan hes got his mother  orphans havent  he isnt poor either come to that  and you dont mind my seeing to her ladyship  why would i mind im not planning a trip round the world  door closes  mr molesley have you seen mr travis  i need to speak to him about the bring and buy sale  bill molesley im afraid not your ladyship  never mind  this were a sad business  very very sad  i cant believe its time for the stone already  six months  they always leave six months for the grave to settle  tell me has has your son found another job yet  no mlady  theyve let him stay on and he always tries to make himself useful  but it cant go on forever and anyway hes lost his wage  but hes a properly trained valet he could even be a butler  i hope so mlady  sniffs  but its a changing world  you dont have to tell me  hello  itll soon be time for you to get out and walk young lady  please dont touch the children not without my permission  what  they are in my charge and i cannot be too careful  i would remind you that i knew this young girls mother  which you never did  that doesnt make you her friend  as a matter of fact it does  well i cant stay here to bandy words  will you ask mrs patmore  to send up the childrens luncheon in half an hour  ask her yourself why dont you  was her ladyship very disappointed  she was and itll take quite a while to find a replacement  i cant believe miss obrien would be so thoughtless  cant you i can  she wants an adventure whats wrong with that  i dont blame her  not for wanting to go but why run off and leave us in the lurch  youre talking like that so well think you didnt know  thats not kind  whats the good of a month of sour looks good luck to her  how was lady mary this morning the same  but i suppose she must come out of it eventually  for master georges sake if for no other reason  i hope so right now she prefers to leave it all to nanny west  i couldnt be a nanny  why not dont you like children no i do  being a nanny youre not one of the family but not one of us either  what are you talking about being a nanny  daisy was saying she thinks it must be a lonely life  i dont know about that  but if you ask me that nanny west thinks too much of herself  why whats she done she always seems nice to me  she only tried to give me orders  you mean she mistook you for a servant  but he is a servant dont tell him hell never get over the shock  giggling  branson thank you mr marsh  robert he was bound to be disappointed  youre sure you want to abandon the whole plan  we dont have a choice  we have to find the death duties on half the estate  theyll be merciless i know  but i wish we could wait for mary to come back into play  she isnt a player  she has a life interest in one third of matthews share of downton  and a third of his other possessions  but everything else belongs to little george  and thats all the law gives her he should have made a will  but marys georges guardian  surely that gives her some sort of say  its a moot point  since i own the other half of everything  isnt it more appropriate for me to manage the boys fortunes  besides shes in such a fragile state  the last thing i want is for her to start worrying about money  of course but you dont think youve seen her  she hardly has the energy to lift a fork to her mouth  she loved him very much  and the price of great love is great misery when one of you dies  i know that of course you do  im so sorry  we better get back or well be late for lunch  ive placed advertisements mr carson you know i have  but the answers werent suitable i didnt get any answers  well i did but when i wrote back i heard nothing more  well i dont know what to suggest  because i cant stay here  mr molesley i should hate us to appear inhospitable  but i cant stay here  is it fair on his lordship it has been six months  i suppose i could go to my dads until i get something sorted  what a good idea  servants lunch is on the table thank you mrs patmore  oh cheer up mr molesley it may never happen  it already has  im going into thirsk after lunch do you want to come  im walking down to the village to see how isobels getting on  remind her its an open invitation if she wants to see her grandson  or feels like company she just has to turn up  ill tell her  i might come with you i dont think so  i dont think shes up to seeing many people  i only meant into the village  edith are you really going to london tomorrow  i have a couple of errands if you are  im seeing michael gregson he must have missed you  hes giving a party to introduce me to his literary friends  how exciting isnt it robert  bell jingles  i i was wondering if i might put a card in your window  a card mlady for a job asking for applicants  and what sort of job might this be why does it make a difference  no i suppose not thank you  erm how much will that be sixpence should cover it  edith you ought to see more of george  poor george  what a burden he is born into  a baby rich as croesus and a mother almost passed over  thats the law  it seems so strange  matthew was always so meticulous  he thought that death was many years away  and so it should have been  if theres anything i can do to help please let me do it  im grateful  but you see when your only child dies  then youre not a mother any more  youre not anything really  thats what im trying to get used to  youre a grandmother  and i know youre going to be a wonderful one  afternoon post ah thank you  groans oh not this again  not what  ohnothing  let me know when the upholsterer arrives  i want to be there when you explain the job in hand  very well but i can easily manage  he needs to grasp the quality of the tapestry on the chairs  before he starts slamming nails into them  and i couldnt make him see that  bell jingles  just closing love  i only wanted to know who was looking for a ladys maid  theres not too many in downton who need a ladys maid  you mean the abbey  didnt you used to work there  i did but ive been studying since then  studying for what to become a ladys maid  madge says that lady edith saw mrs crawley this afternoon  how is she in a very dark place im afraid  and no wonder  for a widowed mother to lose an only son  theres no more fit person to comfort her than you  i wonder  if lady sybil had been an only child i believe id have died  no mlady you would have lived on for the baby  and so must she  door opens  thank you so much mrs hughes and good night to you  good night mlady  mlord  are you all right  i feel we must settle the question of who is to manage the babys property  i dont want to hurry mary before shes ready  what question shes georges mother and his guardian  of course she is but when it comes to decisions about the estate  shouldnt it be me  why  because together my grandson and i own five sixths of downton  marys share is only for her life  she couldnt do much with it even if she wanted to  the point being that with the death duties were facing  there are some big decisions ahead  you want to push mary out  im not pushing her out she was never in  matthew was coowner and now his son is  i worked with matthew i must work for his boy  thanks  mrs hughes a lot of letters for a tuesday  how do people have time to write when the week is just beginning  its saint valentines day  oh imagine your remembering that and my forgetting it  who would have thought such a thing  i am not a complete stranger to romance  if thats what youre implying  maybe i am now but i wasnt always  hold on i thought these were all bills  daisy this ones for you  thomas daisy whos that from dont tease her mr barrow  who sent you a card  i dont know its not signed  nors mine we both must have secret admirers  which is no more than we deserve  thats enough of that mr bates weve work to do  whats that  nothing  of course its valentines day  when are you leaving for london im catching the ten oclock  i ought to pack  have a happy time  man just down there  indistinct conversation  man coughs violently  mr grigg  do i know you  coughing continues  you wrote to charlie carson at downton abbey  i work with him  gasps did he send you  not exactly in a way  he coughs  crate scrapes  what what did he say about me  what does he plan to do  mr carson is very busy he wanted me to find out how you are  then i think hell come up with a plan  sighs i knew it  he said some harsh things when we last met  but we go back a long way charlie and me  and whatevers happened  to theatre folk like us that means something  coughs  yes im sure it does  metal screeches  steam hisses  whistle blowing  thank you madam thank you  edith this is very lovely  shouldnt you be at the office aunt rosamunds sending her car  ive missed you i havent stopped thinking about you for one moment  well im here now  i couldnt be more thrilled because ive got some news  well not news more an idea go on  ive done some research  and discovered not every country is the same as england  you amaze me  no i mean there are places where lunacy is grounds for divorce  portugal and greece and even germany  but wouldnt you have to live there  no no im just finding out whats involved  but if i did live in germany would you come with me  oh hello burns  this is burns aunt rosamunds chauffeur  good

a hand  i can manage thank you miss west  come to me darling  hello  now heres the little prince mlady  baby gurgles  see how happy he is to see his beautiful mama  god bless him  thank you nanny  you say you have no purpose  but what about little george  surely youre interested in him  of course but im not going to drive mary mad by interfering  its the job of grandmothers to interfere  doorbell rings  oh thats molesley  he asked to see me and i told him when he could come  oh well may i stay  or is it a secret assignation  oh im very sorry to interrupt your ladyship  what is it molesley  i came to ask if youd consider giving me my old job back  i apologise for forcing myself on a private conversation  i will go  no please mlady theres no mystery  ive lost my job because well for obvious reasons  and i thought id ask here  the trouble is i have no need for a butler  these days im just an old widow who eats off a tray  i see  just because youre an old widow i see no necessity to eat off a tray  you and i are different  yes that is very true  im wasting your time  should should we hear of an opening  where would we find you  im moving to my fathers house mlady  piano music playing  chattering and laughter  have you had any more time to think about what i said  you mean our living in sin  wed only live in sin as you call it until the divorce  dont you want to be with me  you know i do more than anything  erm is there any more gin sir were running rather low  yes ill er ill have a look  oh my lord  this is an honour your ladyship i have a message for your son  lady shackleton is joining me for luncheon  i want him to come and help  but what about mr spratt  well spratt will be there of course  but molesley can still take an active part  lady shackleton tells me her butler is retiring  wont she have made arrangements to find another  but that is the point  she hasnt yet decided whether to replace him or not  so if molesley can demonstrate his skills  mr spratt wont mind  it is not his business to mind  no well  very good mlady thank you very much  you took a letter out of my waste paper basket  when i had clearly crumpled it and thrown it away  i could see it had upset you i wanted to know why  im sure  but it didnt occur to you it might not be your concern why i was upset  well anyway i did it and i read it and i went to see him  sighs in frustration  dont you want to know how he is  if i wanted to know how he is i would have answered his letter  mr carson hes in the workhouse  and in case youre wondering  its as bad as if we were reading about it in a novel by dickens  havent they closed the workhouses  no they havent not all of them  well at least hes in the dry  if you can call it dry when theres mould in the very air you breathe  this is a man you sang and danced with  do you feel nothing  i dont feel i could be helpful no  and i would thank you not to remind me  of a time in my life i prefer to forget  mrs patmore but why would we need it  its a mixer it beats eggs and whips cream and all sorts  but you and ivy do that  and wed be glad not to thank you very much  did lady edith say why she got it her ladyship asked her to  she wants to save us a bit of elbow grease you dont understand  before too long  her ladyship could run the kitchen with a woman from the village  what with these toasters and mixers and such like wed be out of a job  i want to try it then on your own head be it  did you like your card ivy whats it to you  thatd be telling  dont listen hes just teasing  come on clear out you two theres work to be done  do you think that means that jimmy sent it  maybe he thinks it fun to tease  but dont you see  if jimmy sent mine then who sent yours  giggles  thomas mr barrow to you  can you tell mrs patmore  i wont want the scrambled egg for miss sybbies tea  if you go through here and down the stairs you can tell her yourself  do it please i cant stop the children are on their own  why did i struggle across london if rose was going to sort it out  you had other things to do  it doesnt explain why rose put the card in the post office window  i just thought how much quicker  it would be if we could find someone local  i do feel responsible  have you had any answers yet  weve had three and ones promising so well see her in ripon on friday  why isnt she coming here  shes looking after her aunt she cant get away  branson its time for you to come back to us  what would you suggest  take an interest in something doesnt matter what  poetryor carpentry  history or hats im interested in george  are you  i will be  what have you been doing today  well its this whole business with the repair shop  tom dont bore her with all that nonsense  its my fault i asked even so  you concentrate on feeling better  you mustnt worry about anything else  did you send a valentines card  suppose i did  was it to ivy thats my business  thomas you didnt really send ivy a card  is it likely  i sent one to lady anstruther  i worked for her and shes coming back from france  she might be useful  wasnt that a bit forward oh i dont think shell mind  to be honest mrs hughes  i dont see that its any of my business  thats something i never thought id hear you say maam  a wretched man is in the workhouse and he reaches out to us for rescue  well he reached out to carson i dont see what you want me to do  mrs crawley i  i wondered if i could bring him here  here  if you and i were to vouch for him to the authorities  im sure we could get him away from that place  but why here why not the abbey isnt he carsons responsibility  im sorry to say it but mr carson has turned his back on his old pal  i see  so you want to risk carsons wrath by rescuing this mr grigg  hes a pitiful being but hes not beyond work  hes not beyond a decent life if he could find it  you see in my present state i dont think im strong enough  but you are maam  if you could just set aside your grief  and use that strength for anothers good  knocking  mr branson mr carson  i know you wont think it correct  but i need to ask your help in a difficult situation  my help sir lord grantham is against me in this  with matthew gone ive noone else to turn to  mary that is lady mary is not improving  shes suffered a terrible tragedy of course  but its six months now  and shes no better than she was a week after he died  the only way is for her to find an interest outside of herself  and i know that should be in the running of the estate  what does his lordship think  lord grantham thinks his duty is to protect mary and her son  by managing everything himself  and he wont listen to you on the subject  he sees her as a little woman  who shouldnt be troubled by anything so harsh as reality  and even were i to agree with you  how could i help  give her advice shed take it from you  what makes you say that  because she knows you only want the best for her  im going down to the pub tonight when  after our supper im bored i want to stretch my legs  you cant its not your day off  i can go for a walk cant i  mixer whirrs loudly  i could never do that daisy dont be so soft  i couldnt id keep thinking i were going to be electrocuted  you should have more faith more courage  how about some dutch courage ivy why not come with me tonight  what me go to a pub  without leave you must be mad  dont you ever want to take a chance in life  when would we be back  youre not thinking of going i dont know  i never do anything im not supposed to  what are you not supposed to do nothing  whats going on there im making the mousse for tonight  oh my god well wed better have some soup put by  id rather not rely on that contraption  clock chimes  can i help you i doubt you would if you could  im sorry  why didnt you give my instructions to mrs patmore about the eggs  because i didnt feel like it  besides why cant miss sybbie have an egg to her tea  i dont have to explain my decisions to you  youre a member of staff  and the orders i give are to be obeyed  and arent you a member of staff  not in that way  now i believe im needed upstairs  knocking  carson may i come in  carson  of course  ill leave you now mlady  what can i do for you  well im not sure how to start  but before i do  you must know that i would only be as bold as this  if i felt it was for your benefit  now youre frightening me  your ladyship  do you have a moment what is it barrow  theres somethings worrying me mlady and i  i cant hold it in any more why whats happened  its nanny west  it seems shes been leaving the children to their own devices  what you mean shes neglecting them  i wouldnt have spoken up if it werent for a  a little girl and a baby boy being put at risk  carson this is my fault my lady  im afraid i may have encouraged you to feel  you have the right to address me in this way  his lordship has made a decision  and i find it hard that his butler should criticise him for it  no i never meant  you do not seem to understand  the effect mr crawleys death has had on me  as for managing the estate i wouldnt know where to start  but mr branson believes you could be very helpful my lady  and as the agent he should know  hes just nervous that his lordship will retreat to his old ways  and abandon all mr matthews reforms  and will he if he did wouldnt you approve  anyway whether you approve or not  im sorry you feel entitled to overstep the mark  my lady  were old friends  and as i said im sure this lapse is as much my fault as yours  but i suggest we dont mention it again  now if youll excuse me its time to go down  youre letting yourself be defeated my lady  im sorry if its a lapse to say so  but someone has to  door closes  how is the luncheon for the tenant farmers coming along  well i think tom  theyve all accepted except for barnes at wheelers wood  hes sworn to his sisters wedding robert i think we can forgive him  i have a feeling ive double booked its this saturday isnt it  dont worry were not having the wives  edith can preside  i cant im afraid im going up to london  mary then me  well if george is owner of half the estate now  shouldnt you represent him  well i i dont want to bother mary  theyd like to see you im sure they would but  after all youll have to run it if anything happens to robert  until george is of age or longer  for heavens sake why does everyone keep nagging and nagging  my husband is dead cant you understand what that means  after all he suffered in the war hes killed in a stupid car crash  matthew is dead  isnt that enough for me to deal with  just leave me alone  door slams  exactly what i was afraid of  she is living a nightmare  we must all step back and allow her to come through it in her own time  arent i right mama no we cant discuss it now  this mousse is delicious carson is it the work of mrs patmore  i suppose she hasnt bought it in  i dont think so your ladyship no  then you must be sure to send her our compliments  dog barks in distance  whats the matter lad are you not feeling well  no its not that  oh i dont know dad its just  its just lately i  i cant seem to see where im going im  youve had a shock and no wonder  you should have been working for mr matthew until you were old  maybe been butler at the abbey before you were done  now all thats gone and your wages with it  he were a nice chap dad  you know whatever the difference between us  he were always polite always kind  im glad to hear it  but its raised my standards do you see  i mean who is this oldbat  her ladyship wants me to meet on friday  now listen  in your game if you want the best youve got to be the best  and work at it  get yourself back into service in a good post  and youll soon find your way to where youd like to be  sighs  door opens  im leaving  door closes  i didnt want to run off without saying good night  i suppose you think i behaved very badly down there  my dear im not really very interested  in whether you behaved badly or well  no no  i am not your governess im your grandmother  and the difference is the difference is  i love you  of course you do  im sorry  mary youve gone through a hideous time  but now you must remember your son  he needs youvery much  i know  the truth is i dont think im going to be a very good mother  why not  because somehow with matthews death  all the softness that he found in me  seems to have dried up and drained away  maybe it was only ever there in his imagination  now my dear  theres more than one type of good mother  the fact is  you have a straightforward choice before you  you must choose  either deathor life  and you think i should choose life  charlie grigg is going to stay with mrs crawley  the authorities have released him into her charge  im collecting him on friday  but why has she agreed to this  because she is a kind woman and he is a man in need  i cannot believe you are imposing on mrs crawley at a time like this  when she is almost broken by grief  its because of her grief i am imposing  i dont understand you no  you wouldnt  you must forgive mary  i do forgive her  she is broken and bruised and it is our job  to wrap her up and keep her safe from the world  no robert  it is our job to bring her back to the world  im afraid that is not how i see it really  then i can only say that while i will overlook marys poor judgement  i find it hard to overlook yours  goodnight  oh edith edith come to luncheon on friday  i i mean it  i need your help to make things a success  why what are we doing  we are selling molesley to lady shackleton  you mean as a servant  no as a chinese laundryman  sighs in exasperation  jimmy thank god youre alone youve got to help me  whats the matter with you two  i dont know but id better go with him if i want to find out  coughing  oh my lord what have you done she got a bit tiddly down the pub  shes not tiddly shes drunk he kept buying them  what were you trying to do nothing  shes just not used to it  alfred come on  what on earth ivys not very well  thats the understatement of the year bring her inside  water running  has mrs patmore gone to bed she must have thank goodness  what were you trying to do i wasnt trying to do anything  as long as you werent  here  how are you feeling a bit better thank you  you could have done real damage  anna you come along with me now what about mr bates  wont he be missing you  mr bates must wait his turn  meant no harm ivy honest  you wont say anything about this will you  course not  come on  it wasnt deliberate you know  i know you only pretend to like her to tease me  why dont you tell her you didnt send that card  birds twittering outside  oh good morning mrs crawley i didnt know you were here  alfred let me in  i wanted to see master george  but im afraidnanny west didnt think it a good time  oh er mrs crawley  i understand you are offering shelter to mr grigg  yes hes arriving this afternoon  only i should hate to feel you were doing this  out of consideration for me  mr grigg is perfectly capable of managing his own affairs  not very successfully if he ends up in a workhouse  i just dont want you to waste your energy and kindness  on an unworthy recipient  not at such a time  i understand  but you see carson  id almost forgotten i had either energy or kindness in me  so thats something isnt it  why is she seeing her in ripon i dont know  her ladyship wont wait for the advertisement  she will if this ones no good but she wants to get on with it  how are you ivy  not wonderful  both giggle  i suppose we were all young once  yes but you stayed young  thats the difference  forgive me miss braithwaite  but i have the strangest feeling ive seen you before  well yes i was just coming to that  you see i worked at downton abbey but only for a short time  why was that  i was a housemaid then mlady  and i was starting to feel it was time to move on  i see  so i took a course in hairdressing and i could always sew  and you got a job as a ladys maid  i did mlady but it only lasted for a few months  because the old lady i was working for died  i am sorry  i know i dont sound very experienced mlady  but im a very hard worker and ive practised what ive learned  well i shall obviously have to talk to mrs hughes  if youve worked for us before  she gave me a wonderful reference  when i left  that does seem very encouraging please say yes cousin cora  you definitely want the position  oh i do mlady i enjoyed downton ever so much  it was just that the work wasnt sufficiently demanding  when would you be able to start  whenever you want me your ladyship  you can make arrangements for your aunt my aunt  i thought that was why you couldnt come to downton for the interview  im sorry of course it was im quite dizzy ive got the job  erm yes i can make arrangements for my aunt  dont worry about that its settled then  im perfectly capable of serving luncheon to three ladies  so why are you here  ive an idea that she wants to introduce me to lady shackleton  are you sure this isnt your idea  i wonder if you havent pushed her ladyship into it  so you could just show off in front of her  certainly not  i think its my job youre after  nothing to do with lady shackleton no  so you say  inhales deeply  well im going to announce luncheon  but im warning you thats all  door closes  my son tells me that this decision to remove the farm subsidies  has dealt a terrible blow to landed estates up and down the country  that awful mr lloyd george  i agree  you know i sometimes wonder if he isnt really german  just pretending to be welsh  its nice to see you here molesley  molesleys always been a great supporter of the family  thats good to hear  oh yes granny and i are always saying  theres noone more reliable than molesley  noone  careful mr molesley  oh are you quite well molesley  molesley yes your ladyship  oh  violet what are you doing in london edith dear  edith oh you know seeing people  theres no need to shout i wasnt doing anything wrong  it looked to me as if you were about to drop it  well i wasnt very well  here take this  moseley exclaims in pain  molesley  im sorry mlady  i didnt realise the plate was so hot  poor man he seems quite new to this kind of work  does he  oh but that is no dear no that is molesleys strength  you see he is always ready for a challenge  i think it was very kind of you to allow him to have a go at it  yes well we we try to do our best  i do find it very hard these days to see how many men  are forced to take employment for which they are quite unsuited  i hope youll soon get back to whatever it is youre trained for  grigg coughs  come in mr grigg mrs hughes has told me all about you  thank you mrs crawley  oh  i was er i was wondering if charlie might be here  charlie carson no mr carsons very busy  but ill tell him that youve arrived safely  but he does know im coming here  we talked of it yesterday  now ive run a bath  and dug out some clean clothes from the missionary barrel  they should fit you at least until we can find something better  youre very kind nonsense its the least i can do  coughing continues  while im sorting him out i wondered if youd look in at the kitchen  and tell mrs field hes arrived and to put his luncheon on a tray  i think he should stay in bed today and then we can see where we are  hes right youre very kind  no no we must all do what we can  buzz of conversation  hello  you lookvery glamorous  i thought id make a bit of an effort  im glad you did  ive ordered some wine for us  heavens how spoiling  i love the criterion  it feels so wild  to be out with a man drinking and dining in a smart london restaurant  can you imagine being allowed to do anything of the sort  five years ago never mind ten  the war changed everything  mama used to say we could never eat anywhere public  except an hotel we were staying in  she might cheat and take us to the ritz but that was about it  laughs  i do love you so  do you hmm  im glad  is that what were celebrating that and my progress  ive found out i can divorce lizzie in germany  if i become a german citizen  youre willing to become a german citizen for me  youd do that  id become an eskimo if it meant i could marry you  butgermany  after four years of fighting  youd join the most hated race in europe for me  can i kiss you  what here  in front of all these people i dont care  kiss me now  edna braithwaite is coming back  i would have talked it over with you first but  when i saw that wonderful reference you wrote her  yes but that was because  i wrote her a good reference because i thought she was a good worker  but i dont see her as a ladys maid  couldnt you wait for the replies to the advertisement mlady  before coming to a decision  im surprised at you mrs hughes  do you want to prevent my giving a hardworking woman a helping hand  you know it was jimmy

hughes was looking for me  i saw her go into her sitting room shall i fetch her  no need  alfred im sorry not to have mentioned it  i sent the card to ivy  butjimmy said  he didnt send one  or if he did it wasnt to anyone at downton  good night mrs patmore  she sighs  if it werent him then who did send my card  i wont sleep now  oh for heavens sake i sent it  you yes  i thought alfred would buy one for ivy  and i didnt want you to have nothing to open if he did  im sorry if i did wrong  no dont be sorry  i may not have a follower but at least ive got a friend  goodnight mrs patmore  i didnt know what else to say i had written her a good reference  only because i asked you to  and was i to tell her that mr branson and why you asked me  its up to me to tell her  im the one who got us into this fix  no  her ladyship has lost a daughter and a soninlaw  i cannot now let her think that lady sybils husband was unworthy  its too much  then what are we to do  we cant have her here we must  well let her come back and well make sure that she behaves herself  and if she doesnt  we must keep a firm eye on her  and i hope we may rely on you to see that edna doesnt step out of line  of course  after all she does appear to have acquired some proper training  i dont think thats a lie  maybe shes moved into the real world  well it all sounds like a ticking bomb to me  baby crying  muffled voice  crying continues  there there my precious boy  and dont let that chauffeurs daughter disturb you any more  go back to sleep  you wicked little crossbreed  your ladyship i didnt see you there  obviously not  i was just er  i was just having a game with miss sybbie  i want you to pack tonight and leave first thing in the morning  but your ladyship  please put master george back into his crib  you are not to touch the children again  oh i thought it was nanny west ringing  no mrs hughes nanny west is leaving in the morning  can you find her a bed for the night  and ask one of the maids to sleep with the children  cries but your ladyship i was only joking  i prefer not to discuss it  except to say that your values have no place in a civilised home  now mrs hughes  ill wait here while nanny west packs  weeping  you will fetch a maid and prepare a room  you understand miss west is not to be left alone with the children  not for one minute  i wonder how ediths getting on she has quite a london life  shes seeing that publisher is it serious  well hes not bad looking and hes still alive  which puts him two points ahead of most men of our generation  which doesnt alter the fact she could do a great deal better  do you know anything about him not really  he talked to matthew a bit when we were at duneagle  go to bed  you look done in  do you want me at the tenants luncheon tomorrow  no theres no reason for you to be  i know youre trying to shield me let me manage things in my own way  please itll be for the best  i have ideas you know matthew and i used to talk  my dear i know im right in this  now go to bed  door opens  knocking  my lady  im sorry to bother you so late  but i think you know why ive come  to apologise you have nothing to apologise for  i pushed into your room and i spoke impertinently  i suppose you know my grandmother agrees with you  that doesnt surprise me  so does this mean youve decided to return to the land of the living  because if so im glad  it means that i know that ive spent too long in the land of the dead  we were very fond of mr crawley you know my lady  all of us  i  she begins to sob  you cry mlady  you have a good cry  thats whats needed now  and when youre ready  you can get to work  because you are strong enough  youre strong enough for the task  but am i carson  thats the point papa doesnt seem to think so  dont you owe it to mr crawley to protect his work  to fight for the changes he made  to steer downton in the right direction  i know i can always count on you  for a draught of selfconfidence whenever i start to doubt  and you will always find one here  good night carson  good night mlady  door opens and closes  glass smashes  mrs patmore oh my gosh  sighs ohh what in gods name  i must have put those ruddy prongs in wrong  you did something wrong  sighs what a day this has turned out to be  why  nanny west has been sacked  so thats fun for tomorrow  well ill get the sack if anyone sees this  let daisy and ivy clean it up in the morning  but daisy mustnt find out i dont know how to work it  why ever not  because it makes her part of the future  and leaves me stuck in the past dont you see  oh fetch me an apron well do it together  would you really why not  who needs sleep  thank you  i was never sure i liked her nanny west  its not for me to have an opinion  but i will say this  birds chirping  robert where did you get to last night  i was fast asleep before you came in and you were sleeping when i left  im afraid it was very late  but im glad youre here now because i want you to know  that we owe a great debt to barrow here  it turns out miss west is quite unsuited to the role of nanny  she is leaving today what not another one  trust me well talk later i must run or ill be late  barrow i meant what i said thank you  im glad your ladyship  i just had a hunch that she wasnt quite all sir garnet  buzz of conversation  indistinct chattering  ive no problem as long as you test them first  chattering subsides  im so sorry to miss your arrival  thats all right mlady weve not begun to eat  come and sit here ill manage very well at the end  carson can find me a chair  no sit here ill go to the end  this is your place  are you sure you have time for this quite sure  ive been looking forward to it  now mr taylor whats all this i hear about your giving up sheep  well mlady its not quite as simple as that  if truth be told id rather be farming livestock  and why is that  general conversation resumes  theres a letter from matthew where  hidden in a book in the office  are you trying to hide from the truth  that you would prefer to be in sole charge of the estate  theres bad feeling between braithwaite and anna  mlord anna has been a little unkind  whats so funny nothing mr bates  violet i want tom to be your instructor  are we to do all this without telling papa  there can be too much truth in any relationship  anna lady rose asked me if id chaperone her to a the dansant  keep her out of trouble  gasps do you want to be arrested
