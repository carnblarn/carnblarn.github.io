                youll never guess whats happened now  mrs butes been taken ill and she wont be back again for weeks  what does that mean they want me in london to take over  and theyve asked for you to go with me  i thought they only needed us to help with lady roses ball  the plans have changed so youre coming with me  and ivy can stay to cook for mr branson and lady edith  why does lady edith look so tired  she goes away for eight months to geneva and comes back looking more tired than when she left  were all tired  were not as tired as were going to be  i might go with them i must look into michaels office now im back  come with me  no i have things to do  dont imagine for one minute you can get out of the ball  why wasnt grantham house sold when downton was in trouble  it would have been eventually but not for nearly enough to save us  so thank god for matthew  dear matthew  i do miss him  are you looking forward to it why would i be  what difference does it make if you peel potatoes in london or peel them in yorkshire  huh  can you do me a favour when youre in london  tell miss baxter that im looking forward to hearing the stories shes got to tell me  thats an odd message what stories just tell her shell understand  im going up on tuesday roberts got me invited to the supper after the presentation  lucky you when are you going to london tomorrow i think  i must get some clothes now im back to normal shape  i  i know we never talk about the baby  but i realise it must be on your mind constantly  can we please say she and not it  i wish you hadnt been away so long  they thought it helps the baby to be weaned by her real mother  yes well im sure everything worked out for the best  after all your french must be superbe  thats right granny lets get back to what really matters  do we have to go to this of course we do  if lady wimborne gives a concert and a dinner  then we should be grateful  when does the american contingent arrive  and how on earth are we going to manage them  dont be ashamed of my mother shes your grandmother  its very kind of them to come over for my ball you havent met her yet  and where will everyone sleep this place isnt designed for house parties well manage  perhaps you could share with edith youre joking  well someone may have to sleep on the top floor with the servants  id rather sleep on the roof than share with edith  come on were going to be late  carson all this kerfuffle is making a lot of extra work for the staff  so id like you to plan some sort of outing for them after the ball  before we go home very good your ladyship  oh by they way madeleine allsopp asked if id go on to the embassy afterwards  tonight after the dinner you dont mind do you  rose once we get past tuesday  i dont think you have to be presented to go to the embassy club  i do love ambrose and his orchestra please  your niece is a flapper accept it im not a flapper  but can i go  lord merton madam oh golly  have i forgotten some plan  no no im on my way to dine with the scroops  and im early  i was driving through the village thank goodness  i thought i might have to rush upstairs and bedeck myself out in family jewels  after 30 years with lady merton im proof against teasing  im sorry about my humble soup  is there anything i can offer you no thank you  i just wondered if you were going to roses ball  im invited but i doubt it  pity i thought if you were id make up my mind to go too  a debutantes ball in high society is not really my natural habitat lord merton  im much duller and more serieuse than you seem to think  you may be serieuse the rest i would question  enough i leave you to the delights of your soup  where oh there they are  oh no what is it theres my father and hes seen me  i think its rather wild to find your father in a nightclub  you wouldnt if it were a weekly occurrence  cant we just wave hello and leave it at that  dont you see whom hes with  the prince of wales  your royal highness may i present my daughter madeleine  mrs dudley ward my daughter madeleine  and this is  lady rose macclare  your father must be shrimpie flintshire he is your royal highness good old shrimpie  wont you join us wed be honoured sir  hows old shrimpie getting on pretty well i think  do you know he put me up in bombay last year when i was touring india  he wrote and told me all about it your visit was a great honour  i dont know about that he was very hospitable  but im afraid i found it so beastly hot  how in the name of blazes does he stand it  im not sure he has much choice in the matter sir  no indeed no choice at all poor devil  i cant tell you how pleased i am to have some reinforcements  he was rather grouchy now look what a difference youve made  have you got everything daisy i think so  well good luck then ill see you in london  goodbye  any orders for ivy sir something simple for lunch  but ill go down to the pub for my dinner  i dont want to make any trouble  hello what brings you here  i hope to give mary lunch and take her to the viewing of the summer exhibition  its a special one isnt it my niece is going  what a nice surprise for mary its not quite a surprise  we arranged it last week whats all this  things for rose they didnt dare take them down the service steps  some people have all the luck  make sure youre back in time for grandmama  does mr branson want anything else he says not  and hes having his dinner in the village  marvellous isnt it one minute hes the chauffeur  and in the normal way of things hed be below me now  but instead i have to wait on him hand and foot  standing there while he decides what might please him next  he never strikes me as being like that  he always seems friendly  but we still have to call him sir  oh lord mrs levinsons arrived whos that man with the fur collar  that must be her ladyships brother  help me get everything down and dont make a noise  mr start will give us a hand  grandmama youre here already mama said you were coming later  obviously she thought so as did everyone else  carson tells me theres noone in the house to receive me  well im here now how was your journey  how would it be when my maid turned in her notice just as we were leaving  why who knows why these people do what they do  carson can we help shall we let mrs hughes get inside my lady  and then she can make a plan  mrs hughes i didnt know you were running this house too  not as a rule madam but mrs bute is ill  so i am to take charge until shes better  well im glad at least one person under this roof knows what on earth is going on  come on youre uncle harold arent you  ah it seems mad that weve never met before  well i havent felt the need to leave america  and to be honest i dont feel the need to leave it now  grandmama thought it might be fun for you to see a bit of the season  you may not know me but i suspect youve heard enough to grasp  that watching debutantes in a ballroom is not my kind of fun  no but every now and then its nice to try something new isnt it  well maybe it is and maybe it aint  im jimmy one of the footmen do you need a hand  how do you do ethan slade valet to mr levinson  what about you do you work here  i work at the house in yorkshire but im up here for a bit  are you a ladys maid no im in the kitchen  because were in need of a ladys maid and pronto  preferably with skin like a rhinoceros  daisy is our assistant cook and im mrs hughes the housekeeper  do you know london ive never crossed the atlantic before  well i hope you enjoy yourself  are you excited im never excited  that boiler sounds as if its about to blow up  do i hear the sound of salvation  salvation or chaos ive just met mrs levinson on the steps  shes here without a maid  what happened to the last one she had her head bitten off one time too many  miss baxter could you go up and settle mrs levinson in  i dont mind but she and her ladyship will have to make allowances  i dont think making allowances is what mrs levinson is famous for  ooh youre a sight for sore eyes  weve a dinner tonight and an athome after so theres plenty to do  whats an athome people pop by for music and chat and so on  we serve a light supper at eleven but we never know for how many  so weve got to be flexible  hello mr molesley i hope lifes treating you well  half the time theres nothing to do then its all hands to the pump  but i dont mind that  thomas sent a message he says hes looking forward to hearing the stories youre going to tell him  what stories i dont know thats what he said  so what new scheme are you working on to beat down the upper classes  you think me much more of a robespierre than i am  well i suppose i must accept that in a postwar world  we toffs are the villains of every story  and do you think thats how i feel well i hope you make exceptions  naturally i exempt all pigrescuers hmm  hello whats tony gillingham doing here talking to rose apparently  you never said you were coming to this  well im glad i have some secrets  mary do you know mrs dudley ward my cousin lady mary crawley  how did you come across rose we met through billy aysgarth madeleine allsopps father  ive asked them both to come tonight have you told mama  i will when i get back  have you met charles blake i know mr blake  are you going to this grande soiree gillingham i am mm you kept that under your hat  dear me we seem to be the only people not invited  what do you think weve done wrong er youd be very welcome  if you wanted to come wont lady grantham mind  do i spy a dog in the manger not at all  a dog in the manger tries to protect a thing he has no use for  whereas i am looking forward to this evening very much indeed  play nicely children  do you know how these things work  theres a dinner first and then most people arrive after half past nine  then i shall do what most people do  am i glad to see you weve been struggling a bit without mrs bute  and will mrs levinsons arrival make things simpler do you think  i as a matter of fact id value your opinion  her ladyship has asked me to organise  a treat for the staff after the ball as a thank you  well thats very kind  theyve started opening the new science museum in south kensington  even though its not finished  and i cant decide between that  and a visit to the crystal palace on its new site at sydenham hill  i see and this is a fun day as a thank you is it  yes i think its very generous so do i  very generous indeed  maybe you should try your ideas on the staff  see what they jump at  hmm  mother im so sorry i thought you said youd be here after five  well we just got away early  i didnt think i had to make an appointment  i had a last fitting and  hello harold hello  how are you a long way from home is how i am  harold and i will be spending some time seeing europe   madrid rome paris   and we will enjoy ourselves  i hope so but somehow i doubt it  and this is because you want to put a little space between you and the teapot dome business  oh lets not bring that up again it shouldve have worked  im not much in a drawing room but i am good at business   harold harold we no  we came 3500 miles so we could change the subject  can i help you with that  i was carrying too many  youve been avoiding me  no i havent ive just been busy these past few months  anyway im here now  ill get on with this marking im going to the pub to get something to eat  why dont you join me  i assume edith got off all right yes she did  and she took mrs hughes and daisy with her  im just going to the grantham arms to get some dinner oh  may i present miss bunting she teaches at the school  does she  i wanted to say goodbye i may not see you before i go  ah  my niece is being presented on tuesday  im joining them for the supper afterwards at the palace  how nice  and youre coming up later for her ball arent you branson  mm were off so sorry  well ill say my goodbyes does the offer of dinner still stand  hmm  right the first course is ready to go up  the souffle mix is done for the savoury  and ill make a bechamel for the cauliflower  thank god for you daisy ive never known your true value till now  you seem to be in charge not like an assistant at all  weve worked together a long time ever thought of going it alone  do you always try and change peoples lives after youve known them half an hour  mr levinson might i ask if youd be willing to play the footman on occasion while youre here  what not every day but when we have a big evening like tonight  or lady roses ball  its normal in england for the valets to help out in this way  but it may not be in america  we dont entertain much but ok youre very kind  i brought some spare liveries with me  if you ask james or molesley to show you  i will and mr carson my employer is called levinson not me  in this house you both are  she was not seeing you off sounded like it  have you found her very hard  losing sybil was hard  compared to that everything else has been easy  will you show me the house what  oh arent you allowed to bring your friends back  its not a question of being allowed then what is it a question of  yes quite  i wish tom had arrived its so nice to hear you say that  no i mean hes bringing isis and i do miss her  do you know lady granthams mother mrs levinson and her son  this is lord aysgarth a pleasure  its quite a crowd yes but plenty of old friends  excuse me  thats lord harrowby they havent seen each other for ages  he clearly thinks that lord harrowby is more alluring than we are  the lady rosamund painswick and mr terence sampson  what the devil i looked in at the warwicks on my way here  and mr sampson was saying that hed stayed at downton not long ago  so i made him come with me she wouldnt take no for an answer  were happy to see you here mr sampson thank you  do you know lord aysgarth i do sampson and i are old friends  how are you billy  did you really keep it a secret from charles you were coming tonight  i didnt keep it a secret i just didnt tell him  you certainly dont give up easily  well i wont give up at all  youre in for a dry night no bad thing around this family  i had a nasty brush with them up in yorkshire last year  who are they lady granthams mother and brother  over from america i suppose interesting  it would be if he plays cards why theyre absolutely made of money  how do you think the downton roof still keeps out the rain  do you hear that madeleine  would you care for one of these i think theyre quite nice  have you lost your mind why what have i done  youre a footman not a travelling salesman  please keep your opinions on the catering to yourself  hows it going her ladyship seems pleased  were taking up the buffet now i only hope weve got enough  dinner supper and no doubt a big breakfast tomorrow  its a wonder theyre not all the size of a tub  oh anna theres an appeal at the scottish church in pont street for old clothes  theyre collecting for russian refugees  you wont have brought anything with you that youd want to throw away  but you might spread the word of course  ive been on at mr bates to take advantage of being in london and get a few things  trouble is he does hate shopping that must be because hes a man  do you know england well mr levinson er not really  he hasnt been here since my daughter got married  but dont worry im well prepared for cold baths warm drinks  and most of all the food  as i said he doesnt travel much  theyre going into supper harold why dont you take miss allsopp into the dining room  well  you neednt if you dont want to  are you determined to put me off  ok well if thats what you want  so shall we i dont see why not  why not what  some of us are going on to the embassy later  oh what fun  oh well you can come if youd like i will  why is sampson here aunt rosamund brought him  papas livid but theres nothing to be done he cant make a scene  i sometimes feel we should make more scenes  about things that really matter to us  wouldnt be very english no but i envy it  all those latins screaming and shouting  and hurling themselves into graves  i bet they feel much better afterwards  i wonder i think once youve let it out it must be hard to get it back in  lets go through  but when do you use this this is our sitting room really  the drawing room is more formal  this is for tea or writing letters or anything like that  id feel as if i were having tea in the victoria and albert museum  no its nice when everyones here and the fires going  and ill bet you say you havent changed  so youve seen everything well the main rooms  let me just look down from the gallery  then you can take me home  im sorry i feel a bit awkward to be honest  with them all being away  well i i asked if it was allowed  its not that really  are they all for the crawleys these are the marriages  one sides crawley and the other is the arms for every countess  and the present lady grantham i dont see one with a dollar sign  can i help sir  er no  we were just going down that is we only just came up  and now were going down again whatever you say sir  im taking miss bunting home please dont lock up till i get back  very good sir  you did well everyone was saying how delicious the kedgeree was  well that were daisys work mr levinson had three helpings  and he thought he wouldnt care for english food  youve converted him daisy and thats something to be proud of  whats so funny freda was showing us a letter  whats so special about a letter because of who wrote it  rose you must be tiddly oh i think i am a bit  its my fault i never should have mentioned it  isnt anyone going to dance mr levinson  madeleines dying to dance  will you rescue her oh i watch dancing i dont do it  i dont believe that off you go  and what about you freda if you promise not to step on my toes  im afraid father forced me on you oh dont worry im used to it  used to what fathers wanting me to dance with their daughters  would you care to dance oh theres nell foster how topping  can you look after our bags of course  theres no need for you to stay i like to keep an eye on things sir  do it mr carsons way  only last night  i was concerned you may have misunderstood  sir  i was having dinner with miss bunting in the village  and she was curious to look around the house  mr barrow  she might perhaps see it to more advantage in the daylight sir  yes and im sure shell be back  the point is we only went upstairs  so she could enjoy the view down into the hall  i wouldnt want you to think any different  however you wish to command me i am your servant mr branson  but i was not aware i was under orders as to what i might think  i thought i might arrive and find youd already left for london  as a matter of fact im going up this morning with lady grantham  i wanted to say you were kind to write thats all really  well when i decided to go to roses ball  i felt it was wrong not to tell you since youd asked  what changed your mind i suppose it came to me  that these balls and presentations and comings out  are not just aristocratic folderol but traditions  by which members of this family measure their progress through life  and you wanted to be part of that  well i felt by dismissing it as trivia  i was being smug and intolerant  do they know what they have in you i know what i have in them  so have you decided whether or not you will come to the ball  oh how can you ask of course i will  but i dont understand how can you suddenly be an editor  i wont be not in that way  but michael gave me power of attorney  it didnt matter before but now they need some decisions  and youll have to make them until he  well until either he comes back or  is there a will do you know it might be useful  to help you find out what he wanted  wants im sure there is but  i dont know whats in it yet  ill find out  but what about his child doesnt she have some rights  his child is not his child any more or yours  she belongs to nice mr and mrs schroder  and lives in geneva with the rest of her family  its all very well saying that but it doesnt change anything  only because you wont let it  there was no formal agreement maybe not  but it wouldnt be fair to the schroders to go back on your word  dear aunt rosamund im so grateful for all youve done  and im not pulling rank but the fact remains youve never been a mother  youll never guess oh try what is it  alfreds finished his course and theyve taken him on what permanent at the ritz  as an under chef but that wont be for long  hes going to be famous whoohoo who is  alfred nugent he was a footman at downton  but hes working at the ritz now hes on his way  that seems quite the american dream to me   poor boy from the sticks becomes famous hotelier  well i dont know if its american or not but i think its smashing  was still here nonsense  whats he doing oh he just came to see me off  huh but we mustnt lose any time or well miss our train  i know im late it couldnt be helped  cora insisted i come without a maid  i cant believe she understood the implications which are  how do i get a guard to take my luggage  and when we arrive in london what happens then  fear not ive never travelled with a maid  you can share my knowledge of the jungle  cant you even offer help  without sounding like a trumpeter on the peak of the moral high ground  and must you always sound like the sister of marieantoinette  the queen of naples was a stalwart figure  i take it as a compliment  you take everything as a compliment i advise you to do the same  it saves many an awkward moment  goodbye  success i have finally persuaded mr bates to buy a new overcoat  so the refugees can have this thats just what they need  are you sure take it hed only go on wearing it if its in the house  well theyll be very grateful id better get back  theres always plenty of fuss before a presentation  there is but i think its exciting  seems odd to me that a courtesy and a nod from the throne  can turn you from a girl into a woman but who are we to argue  oh  may i help mrs hughes i was just looking for anna  but it doesnt matter  now we have to go our separate ways  i feel quite nervous nonsense onwards to the breach  the countess of grantham presenting the lady rose macclare  thank you lady grantham  i hope you dont want to powder your nose why not  because all thats on offer is a chamber pot behind that screen  the glamour of court life  whos presenting you my fathers eldest sister  aunt violet wanted to present me but we got round it  shell be at the supper as a consolation  papas coming so are my mother and my brother  mr levinsons here and mrs levinson how did you manage that  lord grantham is our lord lieutenant  and he pulled a string to get them in father will be so pleased  madeleine gosh thats me good luck  so shes in the library and shes on her own are you sure  what do you want with her nothing that would interest you  mr carson i wonder  im sorry dont mind me im just leaving  can i help  i wanted to ask you man to man  if anythings going on between daisy and the fella working at the ritz  going on nothing goes on in any house where i am in authority  of course not i didnt mean that what did you mean  i think you know the fella is called alfred  there is no romance between him and daisy  he has left our employ i doubt theyll meet in the future  because i wouldnt like to push in where im not wanted  the duchess of margam presenting the lady elizabeth bailey george  the countess of grantham presenting the lady rose macclare  lady rose is lord flintshires daughter sir  ah the prince of wales has spoken  about your fathers hospitality in bombay  he was honoured to entertain his royal highness your majesty  the indian tour was a great success thanks to lord flintshire  the prince did splendidly sir he was so popular wherever he went  yes the prince is never short of popularity  lady grantham  the countess of derwentwater presenting the lady jane radcliffe  so bates was in london that day  you say it as if you already knew  does anna suspect anything  absolutely not she knows nothing  so will you tell her now my lady i gather you wont  no no im handing this to you  meaning leave it alone  we cant know what happened on that street  maybe he was in london for an innocent reason  and nowhere near piccadilly  but this i will say if he was there to avenge his wifes honour  i wont condemn him for it  im sorry but i wont  oh all done presented photographed done  you both looked splendid you didnt look so bad yourself  the unfair advantage of a court position  i hear the king was very talkative for him  how was the queen you know  she sort of sits there being queen marylike  any chance of meeting them later hardly  his majesty is not an admirer of the new world  you might do better with the prince of wales  im not one of those englishmen who hates new york  but a great city can be a lonely place  cant everywhere but youd only be lonely if you wanted to be  do you know newport why  i stayed there before the war with the duchess of marlboroughs mother  i thought it was wonderful as a matter of fact im in newport quite a lot  i have what they call a cottage on bellevue avenue  really i didnt know  didnt you huh  i feel rather guilty about leaving isobel behind why  she brought a book with her that should keep her occupied  what sort of book i can only tell you  that on the train it was far more interesting than me  your fathers paying a lot of attention to my mother  you think we ought to tell him she only has an income for life  you are funny oh thats right  the english upper classes never talk about money we dont like to  but you dont mind thinking about it  er or at least your father doesnt  we should tell him before hes in too deep  when she dies all the capital reverts to me he ought to know  rose oh are you at all the presentation courts  you are good there are only four  and david i mean the prince likes me here  he said you were very sweet about him  is something the matter  do you remember that letter we were laughing about the other night yes  well the thing is when i got home it was missing  it wasnt in my bag and i know i put it back i saw you  i was so hoping you might have taken it as a prank  i wont be a bit cross if you did im afraid not try madeleine  it wasnt her it its just  if it falls into the wrong hands no need to explain  has anyone been in touch asking for money  i wish they had then id know how to get it back  ah do they talk much the king and queen  they were very kind well youre not presented for conversation  this is mrs dudley ward of course you are  have we met no i read about you in the american newspapers  gossip really nothing to worry about  but never give them a real story  how do you do harold levinson  youre mistaken sir im not harold levinson whoever he may be  er no no no im harold levinson  then why did you say i was  cousin robert mm  ive got such a funny question  it seems an awful thing to say  but do you think your friend mr sampson might be capable of something dishonourable  hes not my friend  why do you ask well  it was when we were at the palace at the supper  go on do you remember mrs dudley ward  did you notice how upset she was  he wanted miss allsopp to go on a picnic luncheon in the park  the picnic was my idea he thinks hes offended her and he wants to make it up  he cant go on a picnic with a young lady on her own  what is he thinking of why not  because were not in america and she isnt a chorus girl  dont worry hes asked her father and mrs levinson to come along  and whos going to prepare this picnic when its at home  daisy can make it and come along to help me serve  dont be daft i work in the kitchen i dont serve  then ill serve you get it ready and set it out and  ill serve oh i see  you see what its not set in stone that you shouldnt help at a picnic  i can spare you if you think theyll come  lord aysgarth will come if he knows old mother levinsons aboard  oh very respectful i must say  ill be sorry if he means to revive the ways of his grandpapa  winking at every beauty in an opera box  it must be a lonely job all the public want is a happy marriage at the palace  is it so much to ask  and anyway why did mrs dudley ward have the letter in her handbag  i expect it was a love thing it wont be much of a love thing when its in the american papers  do you think thats why he took it sampson took it to make money  the question is whether he means to blackmail mrs dudley ward or sell it to the foreign press  no wonder she was in such a state i cant tell you what it said  dont im a monarchist and thats why i would like the letter retrieved  and why i do not wish to know its contents  i feel so guilty  if i hadnt joked about it he would never have suspected it was in her handbag  good god  then we have to do something at once  if were lucky the letter will be at sampsons flat  we must get him away from there and someone must go in and   steal it you cant steal something thats already been stolen  but how would we get in we cant very well pick the lock  james could you please ask bates to come to the drawing room  are we ready we are sir  only ivy has a basket of kitchen things to carry  and it will be a bit of a squash for her and me and the basket in the front  you mean you want to sit next to me in the back  and if i were his lordship would you ask to sit next to him  well i doubt wed be in the same car sir  if you were  we could just tie my basket on the back  i think that would be the best solution  good thats settled then  youve made everything i asked for it wasnt very complicated  mr levinson does not like complicated food  thats why he likes english cooking  how are you going to manage it now old lady granthams going and mrs crawley  its a lot of work youd better take james with you  we can manage with mr molesley for lunch yes  would you mind im a footman i dont have the right to mind  thank you wat tyler  where are you meeting them a place called the albert memorial  but erwill i know it when i see it  you most certainly will i can promise you that  now ive got rugs cushions and folding chairs  come on youd better get started  its very good of you to spare her it wont kill me  she deserves a bit of luck  im afraid that boys interest in her may not be entirely proper  mr carson all women need someone to show a bit of interest every now and then  preferably in a manner thats not entirely proper  hm hm  bates during your timeaway  did you ever meet a man who could copy someones writing  do you mean a forger my lord yes i suppose i do  what would he be required to do we have to gain entry to someones flat  so the porter needs to be told to unlock the door  the order will come in the form of a signed note i see  i assume we have a sample of this persons writing  do we he sent a bread and butter letter after our party the other night  then i can get it done how long will it take  if i can have the letter straightaway  i believe i can supply the note by the end of the afternoon  so the man is here in london he is my lord what a stroke of luck  i know this sounds rather dodgy bates  but there is nothing underhand in what were trying to achieve  quite the reverse  your word is enough for me my lord  please dont ruin everything not when its over and done and nobody knows  granny knows is she going to reveal the bastard child of her own granddaughter  remember you were never going to mention it even if he came back  i know i said that but i dont think i could keep to it now  why is there some news  not really a bit  it seems he got into a fight with a gang of toughs  the first night he was in munich a gang of toughs  theyre quite wellknown apparently  they wear brown shirts and go around preaching the most horrible things  anyway a man who was there says that michael took exception to what they were saying  he should have had the sense to keep out of it  but surely if they know these men  they can question them and find out what happened  youd think so  oh my dear i can be normal most of the time for weeks on end  but then i think i might never see him again and  i know but thats not the point  if michael is dead if i do inherit  then i have to give at least half to the baby  dont you see no i dont  but if you really must do it anonymously  it wouldnt be hard  this is for the best  if youll only keep silent  therell be other loves other children  dont cheat yourself of that i beg you  i dont know  then trust mebecause i do  whats that youre doing  something for his lordship hm  are you enjoying being in london i am  makes a nice change oh it does for me right enough  i havent been here since i buried my mother halfway through the war  has it been that long  my my  of course i understand why the letter must be recovered  i dont see why it has to involve me  someone has to fetch the letter whilst we distract sampson  cant rose go on her own have a heart  well you then im the one hosting the card game  the question is who else can play  they must be genuine or it will smell fishy  tony gillingham would come but wed have to tell him  i know whod play and bring sampson and we neednt say a word  lord aysgarth grandmama can sit on his lap  i dont want her here shell make some crack and give the game away  what can we do with her  send a note to rosamund ask her to take martha to a play  and mama and isobel  tell her to give them supper afterwards  theyll have to change once theyre back from their picnic so we wont be stuck with them long  i hate to lie ill do it i dont mind lying  we ought to give the men dinner it will make it more normal  but wont sampson be suspicious he must be aware you dont like him  ill tell aysgarth that harold will play  fleecing your uncle will be too tempting for sampson to resist  suppose uncle harold would rather go to the theatre  ask lord aysgarth to bring his daughter  i dont like the idea of you two setting off to burgle his flat  i cant allow it we could ask evelyn napier hes in france  mr blake then but i know what the letter looks like suppose the porter calls the police  do you want the heir to the throne to be lampooned across the world  with a story that will never sleep  even when hes safely crowned and married to a princess  no but i do feel hes brought it down on his own head  even if thats true we introduced sampson to mrs dudley ward  and rose as good as gave him the letter  this family is responsible for the whole ghastly debacle  the pate was delicious now the fish mousse is delicious  and all my life ive been warned off english food  im glad we score in one category the menu was very unoriginal  i like my food good i dont want it original  so england is the right place for you  so i know youre a lord but what kind of lord are you there are different kinds  the british peerage is a fountain of variety  its just a lowly barony im afraid  but its quite old  so you are not lady madeleine  no but shes an honourable  who would doubt it  so how long is it before you go home  late friday we leave for paris and then for rome  i envy you to see europe as you will see it  what do you mean drifting from great hotel to great hotel  noone to hurry you noone to pester you   like the world as it used to be you mean with no expense spared  i meant how charming it would be to see it with mrs levinson  another whisky would you  is it going all right as far as youre concerned  but the old lady treats his lordship like a bad smell  rose says you have quite a reputation at home  as a playboy you mean  i know its hard to believe but its true  i i own a yacht and i like pretty girls  and er  can i be honest please  the best thing is those girls dont expect a thing from me  beyond a good time and a diamond bracelet as a thankyou note  and do you like that too nobody gets disappointed  and i hate to disappoint people  is it why you never married oh what a leading question  i thought wellborn english girls  were supposed to be reticent and refined  that was before the war ah  well i would find it hard to respect any woman who wished to marry me  but plenty of nice women would want to marry you mr levinson  you mean because im rich  you are strange you invite me here today as an apology  and yet you seem bent on offending me again i hope not  because i like you very much miss allsopp  more than any lady i have ever known  if i may use the term  but you wont go along with papas scheme no  and you wouldnt want me to how do you know that  because youre better than your father miss allsopp  will you warn your mother off him  oh my mother can look after herself believe me  can you really manage oh yes  you were going to be ten anyway now everyones here  so 14 makes no difference  i only hope mrs hughes can sort out the sleeping arrangements  mm were packed in like sardines but i suppose its not for long  ooh if the familys sardines my lady the staff are like maggots  erm wheres bates he were in the servants hall earlier on  thank you mrs patmore my lady  his lordship asked if theres any news on the note for tonight  its here my lady  but thats extraordinary how did you get him to do it so quickly  he had nothing else on its all quite proper whatever it may seem  as his lordship assured me  good luck with the recovery plan when you get to mr sampsons flat  well let you know  well id better tell his lordship were all set  its a funny thing about london isnt it  the way it seems to draw one into peculiar situations  like any big city  i expect many people must regret things they got up to in london  is there anything i can do my lady  its only that weve forced this dinner on mrs patmore without warning  i was checking to see if she was on top of it  mrs patmore is very resilient  im not sure i can leave it alone with the ticket  were talking about a mans life mrs hughes  whatever we may think do we have a right to do nothing  so mr bates must be ruined or even hanged  because a vile vicious monster is no longer with us  im sorry what youre asking me to do is wrong  whoever the man whatever the motive its wrong  what a card game here  and what are the ladies supposed to do  put feathers in their hair and light the gentlemens cigars  you know rosamund wants to take you to the theatre oh i dont think so  oh no im too tired for an evening of secondhand emotion  oh me too one outings enough id rather stay in and play cards  oh pokers not your game  i hope you dont mind playing on your first night here not at all  then well sit and talk and leave the men to it  so it doesnt strike you as odd no not really well not very  and marys men why are they coming dont call them marys men  theyre coming for cards mama except for charles blake  he doesnt play that is he wont play tonight  we could play a different game oh no he has to go out  hes taking mary and me to see a show not a very long show  i wish youd say whats going on  well now isis old girl are you happy to be in london  shes happy to see you i was no substitute  whoa well the gangs all here i see  is that american for hello  harold i dont believe youve met tom sybils husband  it seems strange we never met when she was here to introduce us  well im glad to know you now  how curious these phrases are could we get some tea  with milk  well i hope you enjoyed our picnic of course we did  even if the combination of openair picnics and afterdinner poker  make me feel as though ive fallen through a lookingglass  into the dejeuner sur lherbe  its lucky you dont exaggerate mama  poker after dinner theres a message from rosamund that shes taking us to the theatre  not us  you why have i been selected for this honour  she was complaining she doesnt see enough of you  enough for what  well if im going to the theatre then i ought to change  yes i should  have you heard from alfred again why would we  dont suppose he can be bothered with us now cooking for film stars and the crowned heads of europe  ill crown you if you dont get that back on the heat  no but hes escaped hasnt he escaped from what  well you know  ordinary life  oh  before you go in my lord what is it  i wasnt sure whether to tell you but i was put in charge of downton when you left  is something wrong not in that way  and you may think its not my business  but when the familys honour is concerned my lord it is my business  go on the other night i was patrolling the galleries  making sure everything was shipshape before i turned in  when i ran into mr branson with a lady  upstairs just as i said my lord on the bedroom gallery  what time was this oh quite late  i cant say which room theyd been in or if theyd been in a room at all except  i dont know why else theyd be up there  anyway they went downstairs and he drove her back to the village  who was this lady he said her name was miss bunting  a miss sarah bunting  of course mr branson is still a young man  and he cant be expected to stay single all his life but even so  thank you barrow yes my lord  do we have anything i can take up some ice in why do you need ice  mr levinson seems to want it in everything he drinks  er im glad youre all here  i have something i want to tell you  her ladyship wants to give us all a day out while were in the south  oh  ive been thinking a visit to the science museum  or perhaps to see where theyve put the crystal palace  then theres the royal institution  or the natural history museum  of course westminster abbey is always a good day out  well im sure well come up with something  erm could i have that ice  mrs hughes did you get rid of that old coat  i did they were very grateful we should tell that to mr bates  i took it without saying and he hadnt gone through the pockets  there was nothing in them was there  nothing that matters now  well thats a funny answer  can i help you miss baxter no no  i hope daisy gave you my message  she did yes so whats going on  i know you theres something  are you free miss baxter ive a book ive been meaning to show you  thank you mr molesley  what was it you wanted to say you must promise not to answer straightaway  not to answer what mr levinson wants you to come to america  to cook for him  well be touring europe for a month you have plenty of time to decide  then if you agree hell send you the fare and ill meet you in new york  are you serious he says hell be teased for hiring an english cook  but he loves your food  he does  thats not what i were expecting  terribly out of practice havent played since downton  its rather sad poor mr gregson wont be joining us  youve heard about that everyone has  its quite a mystery but i confess to a certain relief  he wont be at the table tonight  did he give you a difficult time of it  to be honest i wasnt sure he was playing strictly according to hoyle  but well leave it since the poor chaps missing  i hope we can trust everyone at the table tonight  im disappointed i was rather hoping to find mrs levinson here  im sure you were  i gather youve been entertaining in our absence  have i barrow mentioned a friend of yours came up for dinner one night  not for dinner but i brought her to the house after dinner  after dinner shewanted to have a look  we ought to concentrate or sampson will have his way with us  this is so kind of you  sorry to hear that mr sampson was taken ill miss  im sure it isnt serious but we do need to gather some things  let me know when youre done and ill come and lock up thank you  its rather sad to see the truth behind mr sampsons smooth facade  cheating at cards cant be very lucrative after all never mind that  charles you take the desk and mary well search the bedroom  they say men hide things in their sock drawer  whys that do you think its a deterrent  what could be more revolting than rummaging through a strange mans socks ugh  youre very thoughtful miss baxter  am i  its no use ganging up with mr molesley  he cant protect you like i can  and he doesnt know what i know does he  he knows how to be kind mr barrow  he has the advantage of you there  erm mine i believe sorry  oh so you do have the cards i must play more  you said sampson would have the trick of it  i havent had a hand all night  gentlemen have we had enough surely not  weve only just begun no no i think thats it  i gather weve failed to protect the prince from his recklessness  so now the press will go to town im afraid so  but i daresay his lack of judgment would have tripped him up sooner or later  rather gloomy for a monarchist im a realist monarchist  i think someones waiting for you  i should be off im so grateful  really  well if it does all blow up i hope he finds out how hard we tried  i cant be sad though no  you were in trouble and you called on me  it seems a very positive step which id like to see repeated immediately if possible  must i be in trouble again so soon i mean it mary  give me a chance  are you sure my lots going down and your lots coming up  is that a receipt for a peaceful coexistence  i wouldnt put it like that id say i believe in the future  and so could you  id better go  ill see you at the ball  mr bates lady rose is back and she asked me to tell you  that the note worked  but they couldnt find what they were looking for whatever that means  what does it mean james when they leave ill need a hand with the coats  id like to help mr carson oh that would be appreciated  thank you  so from tomorrow its full speed ahead for the ball  could we tell them about the outing to keep their spirits up  have you had any further thoughts well i was wondering if we might go for something more obvious  madame tussauds perhaps  there are interesting historical figures to be seen there and not just sensational ones  are there  are you all right my darling  i never know whats going on inside that head of yours  not these days  but you do know i would never do anything to hurt you dont you  what an extraordinary thing to say extraordinary or not its true  whatever i may do it would never be to hurt you  good night papa  do you mean weve all been kept in the dark for nothing  im afraid so kept in the dark about what  oh just some romantic scheme  nothing more  might it concern my old friend aysgarth  who came here to see a certain lady from across the seas  a certain lady destined to go back across the seas with any luck  lady grantham im very touched by your generosity to me  i know we english dont speak of such things  but i wont forget it  thats quite all right  good night good night  it was nice of you to come tonight after our conversation earlier  i hope youll be at the ball  why wouldnt i be  good  i expect youll have another game tomorrow how well you know me  thank you which is mr sampsons i have it here thank you mr carson  dont you ever get tired of it its a lucrative game  thanks did you talk to mr levinson  there we are sir  and theres no chance of mrs levinson good night  im worn out im worn out  i feel as if ive spent the whole evening trapped in the cast of a whodunit  nobodys done it thats the problem  good night mama good night dear  i beg your pardon my lord  whats this  it occurred to me my lord  that were i in possession of a very sensitive document  i would not leave it unguarded in my home  but rather i would take it with me wherever i went  so i helped a gentleman on with his coat  he left it in his overcoat it was in his inside breast pocket  and now it is safely in your hands  ill see you upstairs my lord  i dont believe it how  mr sampson appears to have dropped it and bates picked it up  he dropped it arent we fortunate  fortunate is one word for it  so it was a happy ending my lady a happy ending for the prince  a crisis for the monarchy has been averted  although given his character i wonder if we wont see another before hes finished  but the next one wont be the fault of the crawley family  but seriously we are so much in bates debt  ill thank him in the morning but would you tell him how grateful we are  hell be glad to have been of use my lady  hes very loyal to the family but you already know that  i do and the family is loyal to him  to both of you  huh  we should start the dancing  and i think it would be nice if you began it with rose  family duty comes in many forms  wait a minute whats this  lady grantham i know were just crashers and we havent been invited   well i havent anyway  but we hoped you wouldnt mind  you honour this house with your presence sir  i dont know if the dancing has started yet  but perhaps his royal highness and rose could  would you permit me to open the ball  waldteufel the skaters waltz  if she isnt a darling of london society after a kickoff like this  it wont be his fault  are you glad you came  i mean these are your people now you must remember that  this is your family this may be my family but these are not quite my people  that sounds like a challenge does it  well heres another  would you like to dance oh wellare you sure  well then i accept the challenge  i know i know i can trust you to steer  how did you manage this  i told him in his whole life hed never owed more to anyone  than he does to rose  and did you tell him why certainly not  but he trusts me and hes a faithful little chap  so am i freda  annoyingly so am i  what do you mean no  what do you think i mean its not a very complicated word  dont you want to be lady aysgarth and rank alongside your daughter  lord aysgarth im modern  i dont hanker for those days before the war  and i dont really want to spend the rest of my life  among people who think me loud and opinionated and common  but i assure you they wouldnt ah yes they would  and you know theyd be right  because i think they are narrow and pompous  and boring  well then why did you encourage me  because i thought that it would add to the fun of the trip  and i was right  so why dont you come and visit newport  and i will rustle up old rich widows  who want titles much more than i do  wouldnt that call it quits  this is not me london has remade me in a different image  maybe london has released you to be seen as you really are  ah miss allsopp  madeleine  and please dont think too harshly of us  father is frightened  you see he doesnt know how to live without money ah  well thank you for your honesty im only sorry i couldnt help  you have helped i wont play his game again  and youre the one i have to thank for that hmm  but now im going to help you im flattered you should want to  there you go again  you say youre only fit for goodtime girls who see a profit in friendship  and you dont agree huh i know that any woman no matter who she was  would be lucky to claim you as her husband  youre kind clever and much too modest  and i speak without guile because i know you have escaped my net  thank you  when do you go we get the boat train friday  hmm but youll pleased to hear im going to hire an english cook  my valet appears to have recruited one  will you write tell me how things are going  madeleine i should be delighted  harold  can we stop without my having to hand you over to someone else  lets hide  are you enjoying yourself its exciting to see the prince of wales  were going to watch from the basement steps when he leaves  i dont know what mr barrows got over you  and i dont want to know  but he mustnt make you do things that arent right  and you cant let him bully you  thats easy to say i know  but if he draws you into his schemes thats not going to be easy for you either  sometimes its better to you know take a risk  than to go down the wrong path  thats all  are you taking this or should i carry it up to the ballroom myself  sorry  i gather it turned out well the other night after all  thats why the prince came to open the ball  im glad  is there any progress on whether its going to turn out well for me  oh tony i wish i knew  i feel so cruel dangling you and charles and even evelyn on the end of a string  you didnt refuse charles either i tried but he wouldnt have it  are you sure its not him  my destiny is to save downton for george  by spending every penny and every waking minute holding it together  yes charles is on the other side of that struggle  hes an outsider who resents the very people i come from  even if he loves me how can we pull as team  of course i should sing and dance to hear you say that  but you seem to have got the wrong end of the stick with charles  what do you mean charles is the heir to his fathers cousin  sir severus blake  he is to inherit the baronetcy on one of the largest estates in ulster  charles  but if that were true surely i would have heard of him  well sir severus is a distant relation  and charles has always played it down but he is not an outsider  in fact hes going to be a lot more eligible than i am  why did noone tell me this before does it make a difference  to know that he and i are on the same side yes of course it makes a difference  you sound as though the tide is running against me  tony  a year ago i thought id be alone for ever  that i would mourn matthew to the end of my days  now i know that isnt true that there will be a new life for me  one day  and even if i cant decide yet what life that should be  isnt it something for us to celebrate  it certainly is  strauss vienna blood waltz  oh heavens what is it  lord merton and he seems to be headed in this direction  oh no doubt to lead you down the primrose path of dalliance  whoo  mrs crawley i hope youll do me the honour of dancing this waltz  im really not much of a dancer  oh nor i so were a perfect match  well  excuse me please  so did you enjoy it after all i enjoyed it fine  but we need to stand up to them you and i  we may love them  but if we dont fight our corner theyll roll us out flat  youre right  thank you for that  im going home in the morning mama you dont mind do you  of course not is there a reason  various reasons  i might go to the continent  not for long really  does it have anything to do with michael gregson  it has everything to do with michael gregson couldnt someone go for you  im afraid not aunt rosamund  im absolutely afraid not  oh oh off to bed are we  well thats very sensible a woman your age needs her rest  you need a rest cure if you are taken in by that booby aysgarth  violet forgive me and i dont mean to be offensive  but are you always this stuckup  do tell me do tell me   is the new lady aysgarth all set to hold london enthralled  with tales of how the west was won  well actually i turned him down oh  you surprise me mmhm im sure  you see i have no wish to be a great lady no  a decision that must be reinforced  whenever you look in the glass  violet i dont mind looking in the mirror  because what i see is a woman whos not afraid of the future  my world is coming nearer  and your world its slipping further and further away  good night  hmm  breakfast is done but there are still quite a few in the ballroom  no go to bed take the others with you  ill keep james and give him the rest of the morning off  and what about you it wont be the first time ive gone without sleep  we ought to have the outing settled if were going on thursday  oh i feel  a little guilty about that  i tried out my ideas on them and i couldnt fire up any enthusiasm  so i wonder if we should just settle for a day by the sea  i know its a defeat but what do you think  we could take the pullman from victoria  a dayreturn ticket costs  its a lot but her ladyships happy to pay  well thank heaven you got there in the end  weve danced all night your mothers gone to bed  do congratulate her on such a triumph i will  charles why did you never tell me about your cousin  or the estate in ulster or any of it  i dont know really  at first i wanted you not to assume i shared your prejudices  because i came from a similar background  and later on later on  later on i think i wanted to win you by myself alone  who told you evelyn well i suppose it could have been anyone  tony gillingham told me oh  i thought it suited him for you to think of me as an alien being  i think he wants it to be a fair fight  always assuming were the only two in the ring  so now  let battle commence  let battle commence  thank you just put it there  so if you go tomorrow how long would you be in switzerland  three or four days at the most so weve not got long to prepare  i will pay you for the first month this afternoon  but with three children you must have most of the paraphernalia already  youre right we wont need much  and youre quite sure your wife is willing to take this on  marjie dotes on children my lady  in fact im not sure weve had our last  shell love it like her own  well need a decent story  that the parents are dead and the mother was a friend of yours or something  and thats why youve taken her in  well thats true except of course its my friend and not yours  but you dont want her here i cant have her here  my parents disapproved of my friendship with her mother  theyd feel uncomfortable for the baby to be in the house  i see  which is why it has to be a secret  i hope i can make you understand how important that is  ill pay you whatever you want  but it has to be a complete secret from my family  i tell you what  i think it should be our secret my lady  ours and noone elses  ill er  send a letter to myself tonight  and tell marjie its about an old friend of mine whos died  and asked for me to take the child  she wont question it  then nobody but you and i will know  mr drewe would you do that for me  for you and the little girl my lady  yes i will  how comforting it is that there really are  a few good people left in the world  i know youre hiding something from me i can tell  no im not  dont make me act harshly miss baxter because you know i can  you must do as you think best mr barrow  just as i must  oh whoo  i have to thank you mr molesley oh whys that  there are things in my past that have made me afraid  but  im not afraid any more  im not sure what will happen but whatever it is  its better than being afraid  youve made me strong mr molesley  your strength has made me strong  my what  what time do you go tomorrow the train leaves at ten  i reckon spain and italy may be pretty hot  so when you see me again  no no  i wont be coming to america  dont make a decision too  im not coming  but thank you and please thank mr levinson  you know why i asked you i think i do yes  i didnt say it because i thought it might frighten you off  but we could make a go of it  daisy i suspect we want different things mr slade  but it means that much to me to hear you say it thank you  could i try try what  to cook for mr levinson i know all the dishes daisy makes i promise  yes but it would have worked with daisy in new york   if mr levinson likes her style of cooking  please give me a trial  ill save up and pay my own way out if i have to  let her come youve told him youve got an english cook and he wont know the difference  ok ill cable when i get back to new york  and you wont have to pay for your ticket  but i warn you  he can be quite picky  dont worry this is my chance  i swear i wont let you down  that were kind of you daisy  why shouldnt she go to america if its what she wants  youre not upset then by mr slade making advances  upset  mrs patmore if you knew what it feels like  to have a young man keen to court me  id kiss him if it wouldnt give him the wrong idea  upset im that chuffed itll take me through to next summer  did i ever tell you how glad they were to get that coat for the russian refugees  poor souls  i just wish youd let me go through the pockets first thats all  im sorry  is there anything i can do to make up for it  mmm  let me think  you could always buy me a penny lick  come on  i dare you  but if get my trousers wet  if you get them wet well dry them  suppose i fall over suppose a bomb goes off  suppose were hit by a falling star  you can hold my hand then well both go in together  i think i will hold your hand  itll make me feel a bit steadier  you can always hold my hand if you need to feel steady  i dont know how but you managed to make that sound a little risque  and if i did  were getting on mr carson you and i  we can afford to live a little
