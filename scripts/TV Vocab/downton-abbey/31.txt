                theme music  bell rings  rapid beeping  chattering  bell rings  indistinct conversation  his lordship is going to america  what are you talking about a telegram has just arrived  hes leaving today somethings happened to her ladyships brother  so you mean you have to go too  i cant leave anna mrs hughes not now  how can she put me in this position its not fair  i agree but why does your mother need me  robert must be there why  my being there wont make a difference  they obviously feel it will  maybe they dont want the committee to think harolds a wildcat driller  an earl as a brotherinlaw will make him respectable  they seem to believe so  i know plenty of relatives of english earls who belong in gaol  i suppose weve made the decision  i cant stop his lordship from going mrs hughes of course not  but i wonder if its necessary for mr bates to go with him  itll be very hard for anna to lose his support at this time  mrs hughes i hope we are good employers  but even we expect to get what we pay for  bates is in this house as his lordships valet  i know that mlady but this is a special circumstance  why particularly  its not my secret to tell  if you wish to enlist my help i must know the facts  i wont go  i see so youll leave his lordship in the lurch  and probably lose your job and all this to help me  go home and pack  you are asking me to travel without a valet  im asking you not to take bates  you do know the americans have a correct uniform  for practically every activity known to man  thomas was your valet the whole time bates was in prison  he knows how you like things done suppose he doesnt want to go  why wouldnt he its an adventure  all those handsome stewards strutting down the boat deck  dont be vulgar what do you know of such matters  ive been married i know everything  but if you could just explain why bates cant come  i cant explain it  if i could you would agree with me  door opens  i found this for the shoes mlord  im afraid it seems you wont be coming with me bates  thomas has been selected as your deputy  what  lady mary persuaded me you are more needed here  though why i couldnt tell you  id better get on  your grandmother will arrive shortly  what have they told you  that anna was  attacked by some ruffian whod broken in  while i sat upstairs enjoying the music  its not your fault bates  it wasnt hers but it wasnt yours  thank you  i thought id come to wish lord grantham  good luck on his journey  hes upstairs getting ready mlady everyone else is in the library  oh rose my dear coughs  i wonder i wonder if i might please have a glass of water  thank you coughs  branson judging how things are going he can manage very well  oh are we disturbing the conclave  were just discussing the pigs  ah the arrival of the pigs and the departure of their master  its sad lord grantham has to miss it  are the pigs a good idea mr blake  its a good idea for estates to maximise and diversify  the question is whether or not lord grantham and lady mary  fully appreciate what theyre taking on  oh you ask as if the answer were no  mr blake is not under marys spell  oh  mrs crawley  morning good morning  your water mlady thank you carson  are you feeling hot i am  ive just walked up from the village  i am a bit hot but i didnt walk  i envy you  well im not sorry i can say that  how do you know youll get a ship theres always empty cabins  sure well find something oh i wish it were me  wouldnt you miss ivy  nothings gonna come of that it were a waste of money and effort  im sure somethings around the corner  i wish itd get a move on or i might do something stupid  ha well when i get back i want to find you happy and healthy  and courting a girl from the village  come on lets go up you can wish me luck  darling i do think your going to rescue my hopeless brother  is an act of real love and i cherish you for it  thatll keep me warm as i cross the raging seas  good now kiss me  lady grantham says we can stay til were done  but itll be a few weeks more i hope you dont mind  not if you make yourselves useful we will  try to be strong my darling i will  gregson must be out there somewhere  i wish youd let me send a detective theres no point  his firms already done all that to no avail  if theres anything you want us to do  mama will give you whatever you need  goodbye mama goodbye my dear  try not to let those yankees drive you mad  mary why so preoccupied  am i im afraid my mind is on other things  anyway goodbye papa and please try to enjoy yourself  good luck with the pigs  rose i leave you in charge of fun  mission understood captain  goodbye isobel  bye tom  look after all my womenfolk including isis  especially isis ill try my best  goodbye miss baxter i look forward to a full report when i get back  why am i going instead of mr bates  i dont know  thomas no but thats what youre going to find out  oh well thats a relief  is it  yes im im feeling rather ill  i wanted him away before i keel over  i am sorry would you like me to come back with you  that is the very last thing i would want coughs  oh carson can i have a car please to take me home  certainly your ladyship yes now  thank you for seeing him off evelyn wanted to  but now we must go or well be late  is it just lack of money why these places are all failing  usually but why is that  because so few owners make the most of what an estate has to offer  so few think about income  so few are ready to adjust their way of life  you have to understand what these people are used to  no they have to get used to something different  they think nothing needs to change  that god will be upset if the old order is overturned  and you dont think he will be no  to farm an estate is hard work and never more than now  the owners must face up to that  or they dont deserve to keep what they have  you look very intense  mr blake was saying he finds people like you and me infuriating  i should point out we must get going or well be late  its nice of you to drive me home im meeting the new pig man  i do worry about your life away from the estate is there any  branson huh ive no time  isobel what happened to your politics  they vanished along with that silly chauffeur chap named branson  laughs i dont believe that  i gather the mp john ward  is coming to speak in ripon tomorrow at the town hall  i could get tickets  i dont think so  im not a fan of the coalition as it is  hes only here because lloyd george thinks an elections coming  well i doubt he has long poor dear  but i dont think youre being fair to mr ward  lets go what do you say  id say you better be nice to me  or ill tell old lady grantham you called lloyd george poor dear  both laugh  would you mind if i went up to london tomorrow  is there news of mr gregson  well theyve pieced together a little more  he arrived in munich and signed into his hotel  then that evening he went out and never came back  but it doesnt make any sense what was his reason for being there  to see the castles of king ludwig  but darling surely if he was attacked or set upon  they would have found him long ago  oh my dearest one come here  i dont ask you not to worry only not quite to give up hope  of course you must go up to london it would do you good  mama can i ask you something  you dont think im bad do you  you can be a bit sharptongued every now and then  but bad no  sometimes i have bad feelings  we all have bad feelings  its acting on them that makes you bad  ive had a letter from alfred  whats he got to say for himself hes doing well  some french chap with a name i cant pronounce  seems to have taken a shine to him  i dont think we need praise from the french quite yet  does he mention us  er his fathers ill so hes coming up to visit  he hopes to look in on his way home to see us all  really why should you care  she thinks itd be nice to see him daisy and so it would be  rose what is it  i saw edith on the stairs she says shes going to london tomorrow  so i wondered if i could go too  rose in a few months youll have been presented youll be out  everything will be possible  you said most girls of my age would already be presented  sighs why do you want to go  just to see some old friends youd approve of madly  ediths so worried about mr gregson maybe i could cheer her up  cousin robert did leave me in charge of fun  why is he always so superior  hes frustrated by all the families who are giving in  the axe falls and they do nothing to fight back  but if they cant afford to go on  they could if theyd take a new approach to their inheritance  instead of watching it being carted away in boxes to be sold  he cant think were doing that well no  but he doubts youd fight if it came to it  hmm  he says youre aloof aloof  well i hope youve stuck up for me of course i did but well  go on  charles thinks im blind where youre concerned  we should go in  has anyone told mr carson that teas ready  there was a telegram earlier he took it up to her ladyship  that means theyve got the boat  what a bonus for mr barrow a trip to america out of the blue  huh i wouldnt fancy it all steaks and ketchup  and hail fellow well met  what do you know about it i go to the pictures too you know  his lordship has secured passage on the cameronia  they sail tomorrow and theyll be in new york on monday  its hard to credit isnt it  ive robbed you of such a chance  youve robbed me of nothing i wouldnt gladly give  what did mr barrow mean about expecting a report  something and nothing  violet coughing  knocking at door  are you still awake  i was on my way to bed and something told me to put on my coat  and walk over and check on you  i hope you dont  violet wheezes  how long have you been like this  i really dont feel well at all  right im going now to fetch doctor clarkson  no its too late its too late  ill be back as soon as i can no fuss please  try and drink ill send your maid up with some tea and some more water  door opens and closes  how was dinner  uphill im so bored with mr blakes cold shoulder  he hasnt warmed up then  according to mr napier he finds me aloof  im not aloof am i  do you want me to answer truthfully or like a ladys maid  lets move on  i heard you persuaded his lordship to let mr bates stay here  and im so very grateful  then you know mrs hughes asked me to intervene  and told me why  yes so she said  we still cant find out who he was  no  he was a stranger a  i dont know a robber but after  afterwards he just ran off  but if you described him  and ought you to see doctor clarkson  just to make sure  mlady i  i dont mind your knowing  in fact im glad in a way that theres honesty between us again but  but i cant talk about it  even to me because i want to help  youve helped me god knows in the past  and now i want to help you  i cant talk about it mlady  not even to you  thats it i should be in bed  before you go im worried about alfred coming back quite so soon  i thought you liked the lad oh i do very much  but weve had such trouble with ivy and daisy  mrs hughes we dont want it stirred up again  can we put him off just this once  i dont think ive got his parents address if i ever had it  sighs its a shame  were to end by mithering again sighs oh  violet coughs  she was a bit ill this morning but i thought it was just influenza  this was never flu it looks like bronchitis  but there is a lot of flu about and my nurses are run off their feet  i wont be able to spare i can do whatever needs to be done  shell need proper supervision  otherwise theres a real danger it could turn into pneumonia  well have to hire someone no i can manage  therell be no let up i know whats the treatment  inhalants really ill bring some in the morning  the main thing is to keep her temperature down  and to stop pneumonia taking hold  birds twittering  morning ivy  softly oh come on i only asked what a million men would ask  and i only answered what a million women would answer  hes coming this tea time  ill meet him off the train give him a drink  and send him on his way  itll be too late to send him on his way if he gets here after five  then ill have to bite the bullet and put him up at the pub  wont he find that peculiar  i dont think so ill tell him were all very busy  say theres flu in the house and he mustnt miss out on his course  youre quite a plotter when you want to be arent you  its a skill all women must learn  violent coughing  cora but are you certain  there must be something we can do isobel there isnt  i can manage easily with help from the servants  we just have to stop it turning into pneumonia  thats the real danger  it seems rather unfair to saddle you with it all  why should you do it and not us because im a trained nurse  why is the food so disgusting suddenly  she doesnt know what shes saying i wouldnt be too sure  everything she puts into my mouth is absolutely disgusting  perhaps wed better get out of your way  thats all i ask ill ring up if theres any change  alfred im disappointed mr carson carson you dont want the flu  you cant risk missing any more of the course when you started late  thats true ive booked you a room at the pub  and its on the house you didnt need to do that  i think i did youve missed the last train  youre very kind mr carson  well have a drink first you and me man to man  and then ill leave you to it  why did alfred change his plans mrs hughes wont know will she  thats rather disappointing  what have you got to be disappointed about  itd be nice to see him i dont know why  why not ill tell you  because you made his life a misery with your unkindness  and your cold and vicious heart  steady on daisy i dont think ivys quite deserved this  well we know one thing you were right to put him off  tonight there can be no let up  you mustnt sleep you must not let her temperature get higher  i want another nurse i insist this this one talks too much  shes like a drunken vicar  violet moans  the family took me in and kept me close  when my link with them had gone  i owe them a great deal if you insist  ill look in later ring at the slightest change  well the pigs have arrived  oh id have come if id known  they said youd gone to your grandmothers  it all went off smoothly we can see them tomorrow  did you get the message about the tickets for the talk in ripon  i did why cant she come  because mamas ill and isobel is nursing her  whats the thing in ripon a liberal mp is speaking  i dont think ill bother  just because were not political you mustnt be put off  you wont come with me then id rather go to the stake  but what sort of errands oh you know this and that  seeing friends buying clothes errands  i hope sir john bullock isnt one of your errands he is not  oh let her go aunt rosamund  all right but youll be back in time for dinner  im sure i will youre a darling  taxi  im sure i will what does that mean  edith i dont know why mama let her come  darling please tell me whats the matter  you seem so preoccupee lately  what do you mean youll be out tomorrow night  ill be away but i dont want mama to know  its not very difficult it is difficult for me  to be put in a position of falsehood where your parents are concerned  you said yourself im a grown woman and youre not a spy  the last time you did this you were with your mr gregson werent you  so it cant be a repetition  oh my dear  my dear  edith sobs  im so pleased to see you  i keep thinking youll forget about me  laughs rose  american accent i wont forget you ever  but but what  rose i like you very much but  what can we hope to come out of this  sighs cant we just be in the moment  i dont know many men like you and you dont know many girls like me  aint that the truth then lets enjoy it  you know what the french say  vive le difference  do you think lord grantham will enjoy the difference  or lady mary  youre not scared of them are you  no good  then youll take me to the club tonight  but first kiss me  or dont you want to  oh i want to dont you worry about that  im not even sure which frightens me most sobs  what may have happened to michael orthe baby  erm  what do you propose to do  its  hard to say the words but  ive decided to get rid of it  how terrible it is to hear that  please dont pretend you wont be relieved when i do  youre not being fair  i will support you whatever you decide  just as cora will and robert  that sounds like a speech from the second mrs tanqueray  but you dont mean a word of it  i do  so id be welcome in your drawing room would i  have you met my niece and her charming bastard  i refuse to be shocked  but what will you say when mr gregson walks through the door  with a full explanation for his silence  nothing  i pray he is alive  but if he is i wont say a thing  and you will marry him  if he still wants me to  so your whole life will be based on a lie  have you thought about that  i am killing the wanted child of a man im in love with  and you ask me if ive thought about it  i assume youll be away for the night  because you have booked into some  some place where they will do this  how did you find it  there was a magazine in the ladies waiting room at kings cross  you do realise it is quite illegal of course  and dangerous  what will i say to your parents if it goes wrong  youll think of something  sighs deeply  very well  if youve made up your mind  i shall come with you  wheres evelyn dining with friends of his parents  he telephoned earlier and toms gone off to a political meeting  so im afraid its just us  dont be afraid but we are afraid  how can brainless dullards like us ever hope to entertain mr blake  mary that sounded a little rude  i can take it did the pigs arrive  absolutely although unwitnessed by me  ill go with tom tomorrow  well im curious to see them and ill be out all day  why dont we walk down after dinner lady grantham  you two go ill take it on trust  well its a nice evening what about it  well its quite a long walk  but i dont mind if you really want to  low buzz of conversation  is this seat taken i was keeping it for a friend  applause  good evening ladies and gentlemen im john ward  in a while ill ask for questions  so please remember what made you indignant  when you last read a newspaper  laughter  are you trying to attract my attention ahead of the rest madam  i just wanted him to take this chair  do you know this gentleman no  you just wanted to sit next to him  laughter  er no it was because he asked  he asked to sit next to you  ladies and gentlemen weve been made privy to a very romantic story  why dont i sit down  of course the question uppermost in all of your minds is  why the split between mr asquith and mr lloyd george  because a divided party spells electoral defeat  well can i say this  it doesnt have to  hes wrong there  ward since 1910  but you support them not really  im a socialist or i was  ward and in 1915  what happened to your friend i dont know  it just seemed silly to keep the chair empty  im glad  sssh  ward of course history teaches us that in 1910  the idea is to learn from these then if its going well expand  and you have a good pig man he comes highly recommended  well thats important because  what is it  what is it whats happening  this ones almost dead why  it looks dehydrated its had no water  isnt there a water trough  theyve kicked it over  how could this have happened all too easily  should i fetch the pig man  i could run back to the house if only wed brought a car  theres no time wheres the nearest clean water  theres a water pipe in the barn should we drive the animals to it  when theyve had no water this long you must give it to them gradually  wait a moment  pigs squealing  groans oh  im sorry about that earlier  laughs you cant blame him for having a bit of fun  there wont be much fun for them after the election  what do you care if youre a socialist  im not sure what i am  except a man in search of a better world  why did you leave ireland sometimes i ask myself that  will you go back no  why not its a long story  id better go thanks for the seat goodnight  wheezing cough  does noone care whether i live or die  there there  violet moans  this will make you feel better hmm  compared to what  oh  mary im fine  im fine  suit yourself  she sighs  footsteps approach  knocking  im off erm  well done for containing the downton heartbreaker  everyones gone to bed  but lady marys still out with mr blake  what should i do about locking up i wonder whats taking the time  nothing  well nothing like that  i should leave the front door open with the key in the lock  they can turn it when they come in youre not frightened of burglars  mr carson this is england  hmph  pigs grunting  he sighs  are they going to be all right i think so  ill watch them for another hour and give them one more drink  but you you should go im not going theyre my pigs  shivering oh  here take my coat at least its dry  not quite the evening we planned  sighs oh  what do i look like  you belong in country life  lady mary crawley  seen here to advantage relaxing at the family seat in yorkshire  ha ha  he laughs  she spits  oh  both laugh  where have you been  having such a dreamy time  is she furious that i missed dinner  why cant you just fit in for once shall i go and make my peace  good night rose  whod have thought it  i can scramble eggs but thats about it  i suspect carson had plans for this but too bad  i dont deserve such attention you certainly do  youve completely saved our bacon literally  he laughs  so youre a practical farmer as well as a theoretician  not sure i was expecting that  i didnt expect to see you as a cook and a water carrier  a night of discovery  good discoveries for me anyway  i love how theyve all gone to bed  without the slightest concern about us  what did they think we were doing  we went for a walk and vanished who knows what they thought  footsteps approaching  im ever so sorry mlady please dont apologise  ivy mlady  ivy  well if youre getting up its time for us to go to bed  would you please tell anna ill ring when im awake  good night  good night  engine idles  rosamund thank you driver maam  edith its right  this is it it doesnt look very right  it should say thompson on the bell  well here goes  rings buzzer  if youll wait the doctor will be with you very soon  as long as he is a doctor  indistinct conversation in background  you dont have to stay of course i do  would you like a glass of water  no thank you  its not that i dont love him you know  i do love him  and i would have loved his baby  but i just  cant see over the top of this  no  i dont want to be an outcast  i dont want to be some funny woman living in maida vale  people never talk about  sybil might have brought it off but not me  oh no i see that  but you think im terribly selfish  please dont put words into my mouth  i dont know what i think  except that i wish it were over  i cant go back to the nursery  not with marys son and sybils daughter waiting there  i cant do that  i wont be able to do that  not for a while  not for ever i dont think  woman sobbing  the doctors just im afraid this is a mistake  theres no reason im sorry to waste your time but  this is a mistake  it seems it was a mistake  why why has everything changed ive arranged things for tonight  then unarrange them why should i  because im telling you to just do it dear  rose groans  door slams  are you going to tell cora  i suppose i must do at some stage  if you want me to be there let me know  im certain theres a way forward certain of it  well the decisions been made now  youve heard about our adventures branson im very impressed  there you are mary im afraid i slept late  have you remembered tony gillinghams coming tonight  what why hes driving up to fish the spey  he asked if he could stay the night im sure i told you  did he used to be tony foyle thats right why  we served together in the war on the iron duke with jellicoe  were you at jutland we were  well youll see him again tonight  i tried to put him off but he didnt seem to want to be put off  dont worry its perfectly fine  i gather you were the heroine of the pig drama  so im not aloof now not a bit  mucking in with the best of them only trouble for me is  im afraid its increased the competition  she sighs  hello daisy hello ivy  we thought you werent coming mr carson warned me about the flu  what flu  mrs patmore and i both think were coming down with the flu dont we  we do indeed and were wanting to spare alfred from it if we could  you look well enough to me  looks can be deceptive  were so pleased to see you arent we daisy jimmy  weve missed you i dont know about that  have you really missed me ivy oh i have  the place isnt the same without you is it daisy  if i thought you meant that im not sure i could go  which makes it sadder you have to youre right i cant stay long  ive got to get back to london i should have come last night  mr carson was being over careful  yes im sure thats what it was  alfred what are you doing here  he he thought hed look in before he catches the train  weve warned him about our flu  carson sighs  so we got all the trouble and a bill to pay at the pub to pay too  oh go on with you im sure you dont grudge him a decent dinner  but i do grudge him the tears and heartbreak  thatll flavour my puddings for weeks to come  well youve given me summat to think about ivy and i will  thats such good news if you really are hungry  well im im not ravenous  but i wouldnt mind a piece of toast  ill ask straight away cant you ring  well really really  doctor clarkson when you go  would you please take that mad woman with you  that mad woman  has refused to leave your side for the last two days and two nights  and she has not slept nor eaten since you were taken ill  but there were nurses here  i remember a nurse wiping my brow  she was that nurse lady grantham  but what about cora and mary  they offered  but mrs crawley felt she had more knowledge than they  i suppose that has a ring of truth  ive asked them to bring up some toast and tea  now lady granthams a little better its time you had a break  i might go home and have a bath shall i come back later  oh yes yes dear that would be very kind  isobel good  i can stay all evening perhaps we can play cards  oh  you will be rewarded in heaven  the sooner the better  coughs  i think this is the right place  well if it isnt mr gillingham  welcome back pull up a chair and sit down  i suppose youve come to shake us up again  will there be any more racing demon this time  depends if youre up to it but i expect youve all got things to do  miss baxter i wondered if you  if i could what  if you could let me have some white thread  i seem to have run out of course  molesley go on then  whatve you been up to since we saw you last  having fun and games at other peoples expense  id better not tell you too much i dont want to shock the ladies  laughter  i hope you dont mind my turning up again  its the perfect stopping point between london and inverness  i dont mind at all how are you  well missing you mainly  sounds to me as if the needles got stuck  hows mabel  i gather charles blakes here  of course you served together  we dont really know him  but he and evelyn napier are writing a report for the government  hell be up here for a few weeks lucky devil  dont get to like him better than me  no chance of that  theyre out all day  and even in the evenings weve hardly spoken until yesterday  erm what happened yesterday  some pigs arrived and of course as usual mr blake was  sighs anyway what does it matter  indistinct conversation  hello charles its good to see you again  this is nice what task brings you to yorkshire  nothing as meaningful as yours what report are you working on  current health of the landed estate my usual stamping ground  so did you get everything done  why do you ask no reason  by the time we got back we looked as if wed been wrestling in mud  and had you mary no  but then its always nice to leave something for another time  both men chuckle  so what are the chances for downton  id say they look bright  lady mary and the family mean to give it everything theyve got  if mary means to give it everything shes got  then that is a very considerable gift  i couldnt agree more  cora dinner everyone  they said you were in here  what can i do for you mrs hughes nothing you can do nothing for me  because i know who you are and i know what youve done  and while youre here if you value your life  i should stop playing the joker and keep to the shadows  im afraid we were a bit drunk that night anna and i  so youre right we were both to blame  no mr green  you were to blame and only you  does mr bates know  not that it was you  thank you  dont you dare thank me  ive not kept silent for your sake  clock chimes  i think its gin  oh so it is  id forgotten what a good game this is  yes id forgotten how long does it go on for  oh ages oh goody goody  oh dear alfreds relit the taper  well to be young is to have your heart broken  in the kitchens at downton like everywhere else  ive spent half the day brushing the mud out of his dinner jacket  why cant he have his own valet instead of making work for me  jimmy anna  sorry yes what were you saying  mr blakes evening shoes were quite a challenge i can tell you  i wasnt working here then its a pity i admire nellie melba  id have loved to hear her sing you must be joking  why i thought she had a beautiful voice  screaming and screeching as if her finger was caught in the door  i couldnt take it for one more moment  so what did you do  well i came down here for a bit of peace and quiet thats what  green is that more of the cauliflower cheese  branson this morning in thirsk i saw rose meeting a man  anna im frightened when mr green and mr bates are in the same room  i think i know how i can keep the baby  theres a family whos been at downton for years very reckless  youd never do anything foolish certainly not  rosamund told me what did she say  only that you needed a little cherishing thats all  his lordships back  what a relief to be able to drink in public  you never had a drink all the time you were there  i wont keep it a secret  all i want is for you not to lose control of your life
