                muffled and distant gunfire  shouting  here we are youll be all right  sergeant stephens yes sir i want every wounded man  taken down the line before it starts to get dark  weve bloody well lost enough of them for one day  when did this arrive this morning sir  ah good news  were to be relieved today by the devons  the men can finally get some rest  and ive got a few days leave coming to me  what will you do with them sir london first  to remind myself what real food tastes like  then north for a couple of days i suppose  naturally theres a girl i want to see while im there  so i should hope sir  its strange isnt it  to think about our old lives just going on as before  while were here in this its more than strange  when i think of my life at downton  it seems like another world  we normally have everything done before the family wakes up  but its all at sixes and sevens today  ill go through it with you tomorrow when were back to normal  i do know how to run a house  come along  it goes under the epaulette im sorry mlord  if id known id have asked mr bates about it  before he left for london  because ill be in uniform a lot of the time in future  does being lord lieutenant mean youre back in the army  not exactly the lord liet is responsible for the army  in the county while the wars on  but no im not back in the army  it appears they dont want me  barking  morning i dont suppose theres any news of bates  we expect him back any day my lord  he wrote to anna that they had the funeral last monday  williams a good chap but hes not bates when it comes to uniforms  i may not be a real soldier  but i think i ought to look like one quite my lord  we dont often see you in here for breakfast  isobel said she was coming up to help  and your mother threatened to look in  no doubt they would love it if they found me still in bed  i dont believe it  please say its something nice  general robertsons invited me  to be colonel of the north riding volunteers this is the best bit  reads it may please you to know  that the idea was given to me by general haig  well if haigs involved it means im back in the army properly  how can that be you were told you werent wanted for active service  you cant jump in and out of the army like a jackinthebox  i dont see why not churchill went back to the front  after the gallipoli business if he can do it why shouldnt i  sybil are you all right  sybil darling  would you excuse me i think ill just  shes had more bad news  i do think im getting better dont you up to a point mlady  gears crunch if you could just get the clutch  right down to the floor but i am not quite mlady  it doesnt seem to want to go  i think it wants to if you ask it properly  gears crunch and release thats better  youll be putting me out of a job  wont the call up put you all out of your jobs  ill cross that bridge when i come to it  horn beeps  what are you giving them to eat not much  they know the moneys for the hospital  so they cant expect belshazzars feast  ill make some cheese straws whats the matter with you  nothing much my dad still wont let me enlist  your father has noone but you  of course he doesnt want you to enlist who can argue with him  so i stand by while the lads on the farms and in the gardens go to war  even thomas is at the front in the medical corps  ha thatll come as a nasty shock  oh you can make fun of him mrs patmore  but hes fight for his king and country and im not  well i daresay you wont have long to wait  well i hope youre right do you  because i dont i hope very much that i am wrong  its kind of you to let us have it here theyll enjoy it so much more  and you can charge so much more for the tickets  good morning mama this is very early for you to be up and about  war makes early risers of us all  i thought i would help with the flowers  bassett has plenty  but thank you  you dont mind my taking over the flowers do you  coras flowers always look more suited to a first communion  in southern italy  well what else have you planned for tonights revels  anything we can think of that will raise money  hot buttered toast with a countess at tuppence a slice  you drop the cushions on the floor to plump them up  i know  ethel are you settling in  i would be if annad stop teaching me how to suck eggs  i was head housemaid in my last position  you were senior housemaid out of two in a much smaller house  are they to come in here tonight  only at the interval and keep them out of the drawing room  i thought mr bates wouldve been back by now  or he couldve stood guard  who is this mr bates his lordships valet  hes been in london because his mother died  only everyone talks about him as if her were king  do they thats nice to hear  anna  help me do battle with this monstrosity  looks like a creature from the lost world  oh  you should let william do that  hes got enough on his hands  getting the uniforms out of mothballs  strained i must remember to put anna on alert for dinner tonight  you have to ease up a bit or youll give yourself a heart attack  theres a war on things cannot be the same when theres a war on  i do not agree keeping up standards is the only way to show the germans  that they will not beat us in the end  well give me some warning the next time  were expecting germans at downton and ill see what i can do  thank you  oh we thought wed come in here for a little talk  oh well im sure we wont be disturbed  please  well the thing is  ive had a letter from matthew  of course he doesnt tell me what hes actually doing  no he wouldnt  but im glad hes all right i miss him  well thats the point  you must know hes been down here a few times since the war started  we had heard  downton is hardly a metropolis  is he still determined to go back to manchester when its all over  he doesnt talk much about life after the war none of them do  i suppose they dont want to tempt fate  until now that is  he writes that he is engaged to be married to a miss lavinia swire  well i suppose we all knew it would happen one day  do you know her not yet  apparently they met when he was in england last time  it all seems rather hurried  you cant blame them for wanting to live in the present  anyway hes been in london on leave  and now hes bringing her here to meet me  hell be here tonight and tomorrow  and then he leaves on thursday while she stays for a bit  so will you miss the concert well thats up to you  wed all hoped that he and mary would sort things out between them  but if thats not to be shouldnt we try to get back to normal  even if hes not keen to live in the village  hes still the heir  and youre still his family  i quite agree  we cant know if matthew will come through it  either way i would like to see him and i want to wish him luck  the trouble is marys back from london today as well  she gets in at five oclock  matthews driving down in lavinias car they wont meet on the train  oh thats a relief  i hate greek drama  you know when everything happens off stage  but should we tell her not to come we might still catch her  isobels right  we must use this engagement as a new beginning  you bring our lieutenant crawley to the concert  and stay for dinner afterwards  i was hoping youd say that  oh there you are im just going home but ill be back at four  sybil my dear whats the matter  tom bellasis has been killed  what a terrible thing  i remember him at imogens ball  he made me laugh out loud just as her uncle was giving a speech  sometimes  it feels as if all the men i ever danced with are dead  i just feel so useless  wasting my life while they sacrifice theirs  youve been a tremendous help with the concert no i  i dont mean selling programmes or finding prizes for the tombola  i want to do a real job real work  well  if youre serious what about being an auxiliary nurse  theres a training college in york  i know i could get you on to a course  it may be something of a rough awakening are you ready for that  i mean have you ever made your own bed for example  or scrubbed a floor  obrien what is it  mr platt is taking her ladyship and lady grantham down to the village  she wondered if youd like to go with them  thats very kind thank you  go on what else would i need  well if youre serious what about cooking  why dont you ask mrs patmore  if she could give you one or two basic tips  when you get to york it might be useful  to know a little more than nothing  they want to use her as a maid of all work at the hospital  i suppose its cheaper when lady sybil can live here for nothing  but it doesnt see quite right somehow to take advantage  no it does not  i hear the young men that are being brought in now are very disfigured  how terrible  limbs missing and faces blown apart  and lady sybils been nurtured so very gently  and what types would she be working with  still youll know whats best to do  yes  i certainly will  wheres the butter for the pancakes its in the cold larder  are we having pancakes tonight are we heck as like  upstairs dinner crepes suzette  oh ive always wanted to try those could you save me some  if they dont finish them all  save you some crepes suzette  if you dont mind what are we having  lamb stew and semolina do you eat a lot of stews  dont you fancy that dear not all the time  oh i see  would you like to sleep in her ladyships bedroom  while youre at it i wouldnt mind  i hate sharing a room i didnt in my last place  there were only two maids and a cook im just saying  and ill just say if you dont look out  youve got a cheek on your first day  i dont see why  i want the best and im not ashamed to admit it  and you think we dont  i think its hard to change at your age  i dont blame you but i suppose  in the end i want to be more than just a servant  im sorry  but if dr clarkson needs free labour  id prefer him not to find it in my nursery  but sybil isnt in the nursery and in case you hadnt noticed  she hasnt been there for some time you know what i mean  well no not really  you cant pretend its not respectable  when every day were treated to pictures of queens and princesses  in red cross uniform ladling soup down the throat of some unfortunate  but sybil wont be ladling soup  shell have to witness unimaginable horrors  when shes an innocent her innocence will protect her  for once i agree with cousin isobel  sybil must be allowed to do her bit like everyone else  what about you molesley are you ready for the call if it comes  it wont be coming for me mlady  i had a letter from the war office to say im not suitable for service  why not  i really couldnt say mlady  as you can imagine molesleys father is beside himself with joy  god moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform  bates noone told me you were on this train  they didnt know mlady  well give you a lift to the house  why didnt you say you were coming i didnt know till today  anna i borrowed a case from lady rosamund  i bought some things while i was in london very good mlady  well it would be our secret  a surprise you dont mind do you  oh its not that i mind mlady  and i only need the basics  how to boil an egg how to make tea  dont you know how to make tea  not really  youre right it is a joke  but when i start my course i dont want to be a joke  will you help me course we will wont we  if you say so  lets get started  do you know how to fill a kettle  everyone knows that  not everyone apparently  oh  when can i talk to you  after the concert outside in the courtyard  theres bound to be a gap before they start dinner  are you going up for the concert maybe can i sit with you  dont be daft weve got a dinner to make  ive not got time for concerts ive had a letter from my dad  he wont change his mind he says he can live with it  if i get called up as theres nothing we can do  but if i enlist and anything happens hell never get over it  he loves you he may love me but he doesnt own me  and hes not being fair  glad to be back im never sure  when im in london i long for yorkshire and when im here  i ache to hear my heels clicking on the pavement  id forgotten about this nightmare concert  why didnt you warn me id have come back tomorrow  but youd have missed matthew  i was going to tell you  matthews on leave and hes in the village  so papa and i thought it would be a good time to mend our fences  hes coming tonight with isobel  and his fiancee  what edith  i dont know how helpful youre being  matthews engaged  hes brought her to downton to meet his mother  well how marvellous  you dont mind why should i  were not going to marry  but i dont want him to spend the rest of his life in a cave  exactly what papa and i feel  please try to be happy for him  of course im happy good luck to him  anyway theres someone i want you all to meet  have you ever come across richard carlisle  sir richard carlisle  the one with all those horrid newspapers  we met at cliveden but how old is he  old enough not to ask stupid questions  anyway i cant wait for you to know him  if only papa hadnt closed down the shoot  most people have stopped shooting now that the wars on  but im sure papa would be happy to have sir richard come and stay  are you i shouldnt have thought he was papas type at all  are you coming ill be down in a minute  are you all right mlady  oh anna  its awfully grand  youd better get used to it  itll be your home one day  im not sure home would ever be quite the word to describe it  my dear fellow welcome back its so very good to see you  may i present miss lavinia swire  how do you do lord grantham how do you do miss swire  so thats marys replacement  well i suppose looks arent everything  i think she seems rather sweet  im afraid meeting us all together must be very intimidating  i do hope so  now please come this way thank you  its good to see you  hello miss swire im mary crawley  of course you are i mean ive been longing to meet you  because ive heard so much about you from matthew  oh that is nice things i hope  what else would she hear from me  please  i cant say its been such a long time  who knows what you think of me now  i think  im very glad to see you looking so well  all right you win  we are at peace again  orchestra starts playing  have you found something nice  why particularly  as a welcome home for mr matthew  grunts oh whats the matter  im thought youd come round to him  last time he was here he hadnt broken lady marys heart  lady mary broke her own heart  thats if she has a heart to break  i dont think were ever going to see eye to eye on this mrs hughes  she refused him when she thought hed have nothing  and when he was heir again she wanted him back  i thought caution was a virtue  caution may be self interest is not  perhaps miss swire is a gentler person  if you ask me this miss swire  who it may interest you to know is not to be found in burkes peerage  or burkes landed gentry has an eye to the main chance  thats not snobbish i suppose  i like to see things done properly mrs hughes  and i wont apologise for that  now if youll excuse me  what is it a white feather of course  coward  stop this at once orchestra halts abruptly  this is neither the time nor the place  these people should be aware that there are cowards among them  will you please leave you are the cowards here not they  leader will you continue  orchestra starts playing  im in a uniform wrong kind  that was horrid william i hope you wont let it upset you  no your ladyship  why are these women so unkind  of course it is horrid  but when heroes are giving their lives every day  its hard to watch healthy young men do nothing  by the way sybil very good news they do have a vacancy  its very short notice because someone dropped out  youd have to be ready to start on friday  may i ask what this is about  cousin isobel has got me a place on a nursing course in york  i want to work at the hospital  we dont have to talk about it now  she just turned up at my mothers house  not long before she died  so what does it mean  i think it means at long last  im able to get a divorce  mr bates  is this a proposal  if thats what you want to call it  and you might start calling me john  well why are you sure shell do it now when shes refused for so long  mother left me some money much more than i thought  veras a greedy woman she wont refuse what i can offer her  will we have to leave downton  not until we want to ive spoken to his lordship  and he will find a cottage for us near the house  you told him you want to marry me i did  before you spoke to me  you dont mind do you of course i mind  in fact id give you a smack  if i didnt want to kiss you so much i could burst  branson says im ready for the road  thats not what he told me  oh how delicious i love these  how did you and matthew meet  oh in london my father works in london so ive always lived there  but i love the country too of course you do  daddys a solicitor like matthew  my my youre very well placed if youre ever in trouble with the law  did i tell you ive been given a colonelcy  in the north riding volunteers  so im properly in the army again  oh congratulations  yeah he wont go with them will he  when theyre called to the front  i hope not but he seems to think so  whats it been like  do you know the thing is  i just cant talk about it  have you missed us  what do you think  you dont mind my bringing lavinia  on the contrary im glad  glad to see you happy  what about you are you happy  i think im about to be happy does that count  it does if you mean it  youll be the first to know  what are reading  a photoplay about mabel normand  she was nothing when she started you know  her father was a carpenter and theyd no money  and now shes a shining film star  ethel ive a message for you from her ladyship  youre to go up and she her now  what where in the drawing room of course  theyre all in the drawing room what have i done wrong  nothing quite the reverse  shes very pleased with the way youve begun  and she wants to thank you  now yes now  shes asked for you how much longer are you going to keep her waiting  i dont know much about life in the country  but i do understand how the law works  so i believe i can be helpful to matthew there  but youll be immensely helpful  dont you think so mary of course  i beg your pardon mlady for keeping you waiting what  im ever so grateful for your appreciation  and i want you to know that its a privilege to work here  ethel what are you doing in here  er her ladyship sent for me  and who gave you this message  miss obrien she said i wasnt to keep her ladyship waiting  you may go back downstairs now thank you ethel  right  thank you mlady  well  do we think shes mad ill or working for the russians  she has plenty of time to learn  cousin robert will be in charge here for many years  lavinia will be a lawyers wife far longer than shell be a countess  thats if i get through the war in one piece  of course you will dont even think like that  how long are you staying in the village just tomorrow  i take the six oclock train on thursday  and then youll be in france  wherever im going im so pleased that were friends again  i still dont understand why it was funny to make me look a fool  you werent even there to enjoy it oh dont worry  we enjoyed it all right from down here  miss obrien her ladyship has asked me to take the incident no further  dont tempt me to disobey  did i see lady sybil in the kitchen yesterday  she wants to learn some cooking  she says shes going to train to be a nurse  so she needs to know how to cook and clean and everything  has she told her ladyship about this its supposed to be a surprise  mr carson it speaks well of lady sybil  that she wants to help the wounded lets not give her away  why shouldnt she learn how to cook and scrub  she may need it when the wars over  things are changing for her lot and us  and when they do i mean to make the most of it  mrs patmore sniggers  i take it they ate all the pancakes last night then  they did  whistles  here you are  what are we aiming at  theyd like us to take 100 wounded men  three times the number the hospital was built for  well that settles it well have to convert the second day room  so theres to be no convalescence at all  im afraid not once they can stand they must go  if only there was somewhere nearer than farley hall  i cant get there more than twice a week at the most  ah should he be doing that  why not i only meant with his condition  what condition is that his lungs  old lady grantham told me hes had a lot of trouble with his lungs  and why did she tell you that particularly  she wanted me to write to the war office  she was anxious to spare him the humiliation  of being refused on medical grounds  and who else did she wish you to take under your protection  william mason the footman at the big house  he has a bad skin condition apparently and hates people to know  she wanted to spare him the physical examination  im sure she did  what in wonderland do you call that  i mean i do not fully understand what youre trying to do mlady  oh i knew it wasnt supposed to look like this  no mlady i would go so far as to say  there is no food on the earth that is supposed to look like that  why does everything go so lumpy  tell you what chuck it out and well start again  i dont think we should sell your mothers house not yet  we could rent it out then we can save  when ive some time off ill go up to london and get it ready  maybe i can come with you  we could do it together  ive got an idea that a bit later on  if we want to  if we want to start a family  i thought when the time is right we might sell  and we could buy a small hotel  just just a little one  maybe near here  then we could work together and have the children with us  what is it nothing its just  in my whole life i never thought  i could be as happy as i am at this moment  dont worry i havent come to undo your good work of the other night  you must have been up before the servants  they were rather surprised to see me  i wanted to give you this  its my lucky charm  ive had it always  so you must promise to bring it back without a scratch  wont you need it not as much as you  so look after it please  ill try not to be a hero if thats what youre afraid of  just come back safe and sound  did you have a happy time yesterday  i showed lavinia the places i like most to give her a few memories  mary if i dont come back  but  no  if i dont  then do remember how very glad i am  that we made up when we had the chance  i mean it  you send me off to war a happy man  will you do something for me  will you  will you look after mother if anything happens  of course we will but it wont  and lavinia  shes young shell find someone else i hop she does anyway  but until she does  whistle  goodbye then  and such good luck  goodbye mary  and god bless you  lady mary was very much part of the story i can assure you  but how do you know  well you see i worked for lady flin ethel  i hope youve offered our visitor some tea  ill go and ask daisy  what is the first law of service  we do not discuss the business of this house with strangers  but shes not a stranger shes mr bates wife  has anyone told him shes here  so youre anna  i am  youre the one who went to call on my late lamented motherinlaw  yes i did  i know you did  sorry to keep you waiting vera  i was up in the attics sorting out some cupboards  dont worry ive been having a nice time  here with ethel and miss smith  mr bates ethel told me about your visitor  so ive had the tea put in my sitting room  i thought you might take mrs bates in there  thats very thoughtful it is  but then youre all so kind  im beginning to understand why my batesys got so spoiled  im sorry to trouble you my lady  what is it carson something has been going on  and i dont feel quite easy that youve not been made aware of it  goodness what is this dark secret  lady sybil has spent the last two days in the kitchen  what she asked mrs patmore for some cooking lessons  now steady even the most experience cook can burn themself  if theyre not careful do you think its ready  i know its ready go on you dont want to spoil it  it seems shes made a cake for your ladyship as a surprise  but im uneasy with surprises at the best of times  and i wonder if the whole exercise is entirely appropriate tadah  im not comfortable with this my lady not comfortable at all  i was worried about lady sybil but im not worried any more  so you dont mind my lady  no  i do not mind  and im very grateful to you  and carson the cake will be a surprise whether you approve or not  so please dont give me away  sit down i dont want to sit down  suit yourself  look im not saying its all your fault for how things were between us  but i couldnt go back to that  ill take the blame ill go to some hotel in malton with a tart  so why hold on  because i tried it on my own and i dont like it  youve got money now wed be comfortable  youre out of your mind  what makes you think that i would allow that to happen  you went to prison for me once  i must say this is very good  does lord grantham have his own blend  is that all not quite  you see if you dont come back to me  im going to the newspapers with a cracking story  and id like to bet the granthams wont survive it  oh and what nonsense is this  the nonsense i heard when i used your name  to get a job with lady flintshire his lordships cousin  i know who lady flintshire is well when i arrived  her maid asked me if it was true  about lady mary crawley and the turkish diplomat  they thought id know you see being your wife  i hope you told them you knew nothing about it  oh as if  i said why dont you tell me what you think you know  and ill tell you if its true  goodness me  wasnt my patience rewarded  the publics bored with the war you see  they like gossip  and a diplomat dying in the bed of an earls unmarried daughter  well that takes the ticket for the tale of the year  its a pack of lies i assume thats loyalty and not ignorance  because you see i heard that lady mary needed  her maid to help her carry him and yes youve guessed it  your precious annas going to figure in the story too  not to worry too much its not a criminal offence is it  just a social one  you bitch please be my guest  but then you must excuse me  while i run into town and have it photographed  what do you want from me  firstly hand in your notice  tonight  ill put up at the pub in the village  and what reason do i give you dont need a reason  just tell them that youre going  and then tomorrow we head back to london  well stay in your mothers house for the time being  till we get ourselves sorted  and in case youre wondering whatever my future plans may be  they will involve you  bates when you first came here i fought to keep you  everyone was against me everyone from her ladyship to carson  they thought i was mad but i said to them  after all that weve been through bates and i  i owe him my loyalty i appreciate that mlord but  but what but loyalty doesnt matter to you it does matter mlord  not enough to make you change your mind not even enough  to make you stay until ive found a replacement  i cant you wont take any more money off me you leave emptyhanded  i dont want money mlord  im sorry bates that was a low shot  of course you can have whatever is owning to you  i thought we were friends thats all  i thought wed crossed the great divide successfully  well ive had my say its your life  but youve disappointed me bates  i cannot remember being more disappointed in any man  i dont believe it you say my life is over  and your wife will collect you first thing and thats it  have you mentioned this to anyone else  only mr carson and mrs hughes  the others can find out when ive gone  i know youve not told me the real reason youre wrong  vera has reminded me that im a married man  i must give my vows another chance  i had not right to involve you in my life yes but you see  thats just what i dont agree with you had every right  i know you youre doing something gallant here  making a sacrifice for my honour but i dont want you to  i dont care dont you understand  i dont care what people say  id live in sin with you  if shes threatening to ruin me then let her its nothing to me  the only ruin that i recognise is to be without you  forget me and be happy please  i couldnt not ever  you should and you must  i am nothing  william i thought everyone had gone up  im just looking for that magazine ethel were reading  i hope youve noticed im not scared of electricity any more  well not much i couldnt touch a switch when it were only upstairs  but ive got used to it now  i hate to see you like this  even though im a dirty coward  youre not not to me  but why dont i enlist  i could  i know i promised my dad but hes not my owner  hes not the law  am i frightened is that it honestly  dont be so hard on yourself  noone wants to go to war  oh i wish youd cheer up please  id do anything to cheer you up  like what  like this  you just feel sorry for me  william ive kissed you  youve wanted me to long enough well now i have enjoy it  does this mean youll be my girl  daisy cos if you were my girl i know i could tackle anything  we were supposed to be at rest for ten days at least  orders arrived this morning sir  the kings own were hit bad so theyre out and were in  theyve been shelling the trench since we got here anybody hurt  rankins dead and kent and corporal wright was hit  thank god the stretcher bearers were there  lets see what the damage is now sir  all right morning sir  look out  medic  thomas  it is thomas isnt it corporal barrow now mr crawley  youll never guess where ive just been  wheres anna shes not feeling very well today your ladyship  ive taken over for the time being  oh thats so kind of you  just make sure lady sybil packs things  she can get in and out of without a maid  oh i dont need that id never wear it  but you must have something decent suppose youre invited to dinner  i know this is hard for you to grasp  but im not there to go out to dinner im there to learn  take one just in case  well miss you dont be silly its only two months  and ill come home if i can  why dont i drive you shes taking enough chance with her life as it is  oh granny  what is this driving mania itll be useful  they wont let a healthy man drive us around for much longer  and if sybil can be a nurse why cant i be a chauffeur  well i shall leave you  i have been summoned by cousin isobel for tea  goodbye sybil and good luck with it all  thank you for being such a sport  its a big step youre taking dear  but war deals out strange tasks  remember your great aunt roberta  what about her  she loaded the guns at lucknow  ill come with you ill tell william to fetch the bags  the first of you to leave the nest  poor mama she always feels these things so dreadfully  thats her american blood  im so glad weve settled everything with cousin matthew  arent you mary oh please stop treading on eggshells  ive other fish to fry  i make no apology  it would be a terrible thing if poor old mr molesleys son were killed  wouldnt it molesley im sure it would but  and then i heard williams father  would be left on his own if anything happened to the boy  and what would become of carson if the last of his staff were to go  thats not the point do you want molesley to die  of course i dont well  i dont want my own son to die either  but this is a war and we must be in it together  high and low rich and poor  there can be no special cases  because every man at the front is a special case to someone  mrs crawley is right  i understand your motives lady grantham  and i do not criticise them  thank you but i shall write to the ministry at once  correcting the misinformation  good day ill see myself out  molesley you understand why i said what i did  indeed i do maam  you wont be called up at once  not while there are younger men to be taken  but theyll get you in the end molesley  and you can blame mrs crawley when they do  i wish youd stop working for one minute  at least put the light on or youll strain your eyes  its getting dark so early now  has she gone she has  so weve lost mr bates and lady sybil in one day  i cant believe it  i suppose ill have to look after his lordship now  on top of everything else and i dont want any jokes  about broomsticks and sweeping the floor  his lordships got his regimental dinner in richmond tonight  that means hell be in the full fig youll manage  you know when mr bates first came to this house  i thought he could never do the work  but now i cant imagine the place without him  did you see this coming because i didnt  i have a confession  i let them have their tea in my sitting room  that was nice of you it was quite nice  but i had my reasons  theres a grating on the wall  which means you can hear whats being said in the room  now if i was a gentleman i wouldnt want to know  but

myself and told myself youre too far above me  but things are changing when the war is over  the world wont be the same place as it was when it started  and ill make something of myself i promise i know you will  then bet on me  and if your family casts you off it wont be forever  theyll come around and until they do  i promise to devote every waking minute to your happiness  im terribly flattered  dont say that why not  because flattered is a word posh people use  when theyre getting ready to say no  that sounds more like you  please dont make fun of me  no its cost me all ive got to say these things  right  ill go ill hand in my notice  and i wont be there when you get back  no dont do that  i must they wont let me stay when theyve heard what ive said  they wont hear  not from me  bloody hell there must be more to life than this  you all right corporal  i think so yeah more or less  my god  they wont believe it back home where i come from  i thought medical corps not much danger there  how wrong can one man be  here  i think it comes down to luck  if a bullets got your name on it theres nothing you can do  if not then thank god you were lucky  get these bodies away  come on corporal barrow  i cannot tell you how pleased i am to be here tonight sir  oh we are very pleased to have you here grantham  you see just to know that im with you all to sense that i belong here  its as simple as this i no longer feel like a fraud  mr molesley what are you doing here  i was waiting to see you doctor how can i help  its just i was wondering whether youd written that letter  the one you spoke of this afternoon to the war office  not yet im sorry you were involved in all that  i shouldve checked with you first before i interfered  thats just it you see i think if you had checked with me  youd have found exactly what lady grantham described  i dont quite i have trouble with my lungs  i get so  breathless sometimes  and  ive noticed its getting worse  they havent written to william yet  the ministry i mean but they have discharged me  wont it just make extra work for them  to have to fail me all over again  very well  i shall correct my statement as regards william  but make no mention of you thank you doctor  its all right  but molesley  i hope you will help the war effort in other ways  when might the regiment be wanted sir  the talk at dinner suggested it would be soon  oh pretty soon id say  well im as ready now as ill ever be  for what to go to france with the regiment  why would you do that  because im their colonel of course  well there must be some use for me over there  my dear fellow were not as heartless as that  the positions only an honorary one nobody expects you to go to war  an honorary one we thought itd cheer things up a bit  to have the lord lieutenant at our table  and so it does were very glad to welcome to you here  i see we old codgers have our work cut out for us  keeping spirits high at home someone must  oh indeed sir is that taxi cavendish  i must catch him before i go  so lady sybil got off all right in the end  im afraid we have to admit she knows what she wants  yes she certainly does  i dont suppose the war will leave any of us alone  by the time its done  i got a letter from thomas the other day  he writes that when he thinks about how things used to be  it seems like a dream  its not much more than two years ago  but he says it might as well be a century  so you hear from thomas is he well  please give him my regards  hes well enough mlady  but i dont think hed mind coming home  oh how i wish he could obrien  of course if bates hadnt been so bloody selfish  he would have let us plan for his departure properly  your lordship i have information that i have no proper claim to  well what is it  well if your lordship can assure me that you will keep it to yourself  i promise carson you can drop the last veil  well i feel it only right to tell you  that mr bates leaving was not selfish  quite the reverse it felt selfish to me  as for the wretched anna bedizened with dishonest promises  mr bates left because had he not done so  his wife was planning to engulf this house in scandal  scandal  what scandal the point is my lord  mrs bates would have made downton notorious  the price of her silence was her husbands return  but i must know what story she was planning to tell  im sorry my lord i could not speak of it  without injuring you and betraying myself  but you are saying that bates fell on his sword  to protect the reputation of my family  ethel what are you doing  seeing to the plugs for the night  what polishing the electric plugs and checking them for vapours  and why are you doing this  because you were too busy  she said you usually did it but could i manage it tonight  and she i take it would be miss obrien  go to bed ethel  next time she gives you an order ask me first  is anything the matter nothing  except that today has shown me im not only a worthless man  but also a badtempered and ungrateful one  well we all know that  can i help  i wonder how sybils feeling  the wars reaching its long fingers into downton  and scattering our chicks  but im glad we made peace with matthew  i agree let us thank sir richard carlisle  for distracting mary at just the right moment  by the way she wants him to come and stay so we can all meet him  she wants us to invite a hawker of newspaper scandal  to stay as a guest in this house  its lucky i have a sense of irony  sniffling  not you too  whats the matter  why ask you dont care  ethel  perhaps if you stopped going on about all the marvellous things  youre going to do when you leave service  but youve got to have dreams  dont you have any dreams  of course i do  big dreams  its just that i know now they wont be coming true  what do you want i think i left my book in here  is that all you were praying  dont be ridiculous  you were praying  what were you praying for please go im tired  dear lord  i dont pretend to have much credit with you  im not even sure that youre there  but if you are  and if ive ever done anything good  i beg you to keep him safe  you look very comfortable there corporal  would you like some sir  weve got condensed milk and sugar  i wont ask how you managed that  go on sir  oh thats nectar  are you sure you can spare it  gladly if we can talk about the old days  and forget about all of this for a minute or two  do you ever hear from anyone oh yes  miss obrien keeps me informed  lady ediths driving  lady sybils training as a nurse  miss obrien tells me the hospitals busier than ever  with the wounded coming in  is that true certainly is  they had a concert when i was there to raise extra funds  im curious sir  do you think i could ever get a transfer back to the hospital  seeing as its war work  well youd have to be sent home from the front first  and then you might have to pull a few strings  thank you for that  thank you very much  what would my mother say  me entertaining the future earl of grantham to tea  war has a way of distinguishing between the things that matter  and the things that dont  gunshot  thank you  thank you for my deliverance  do you know sir richard carlisle  her uncle and i are old friends well old acquaintances anyway  how dare you threaten me oh i assure you i dare a great deal more than that  if you still love him let him know  if you dont tell him you could regret it all your life long  youre like a real soldier i am a real soldier  thank you very much now come and give me a kiss  you see i want you to marry me  groans carson  youll find theres never a dull moment in this house
