                bell tinkles   did you sleep well  very  it hasnt taken me long to get used to sharing a bed again  knock on door   who is it  breakfast madam  one moment  ah thank you so much  i can manage  have you ordered something for yourself you cant have mine  itll be here any second   youve worked up a good appetite  i cant bear vulgar jokes  ill make note of that ive made note of everything  how you look in the morning how you dress  how you put on your makeup  why particularly  because i want to acclimate myself  with the routines and rituals that will govern the rest of my life  are you governed by ritual and routine   i dont think i am  do you really have to leave today  im afraid so  surely there are delights in liverpool we have yet to share  weve driven round cheshire and dined in public for almost a week  by some miracle we have managed to get away with it   lets not push our luck  does it matter if we get found out   were gonna be down the aisle before you can say jack robinson  no  and yes it does matter  ive been tarnished once and i wont be tarnished again  nothing is going to happen that isnt properly announced  organised and executed   knock on door  isnt that your breakfast  miss bunting says ive quite a gift for it now ive got started  i left school when i were 11  what were i supposed to learn by then  if i were at school now id be there at least till i were 14  whats the matter   sorry love what were you saying  nothing  before he left mr bricker said he wants to show us the della francescas  in the national gallery when were next in london  you go actually i wouldnt mind knowing if ours is any good  we dont often see you for breakfast  weve got a meeting to organise the church flowers   the rota seems to have gone wrong  is mary back today   supposed to be  good  weve been sent a proposition from a man in leeds   whats that  lets wait till mary gets home then we can talk about it   do you have any plans  i may walk down to yew tree farm   ill give you a lift if you like  has rose left  i think so  she planned to get an early train to york  she wanted to spend the day with her russians which is nice  are you ready to go  edith is getting so fond of that little girl  i only hope she isnt driving the mother mad  mr carson please may i make a telephone call  dont make it a habit  im sorry to ask but i wonder if i might be alone  if you wish  hello ive read your advertisement in the london magazine  choose your own path  this is me well talk soon  were settled now we just have to get organised  rings bell oh what is the latest from your ageing romeo  if its of interest i havent heard anything from him   since you and i last met  oh how disappointing  to you perhaps not especially to me   by the way how is spratt  hes well i think why do you ask  he wasnt there to open the door i wondered if he might be ill  oh no hes not ill hes in liverpool  his niece got married yesterday   and spratt had to take her down the aisle  oh  it seems unlikely to think of spratt with a private life  hm yes unlikely and extremely inconvenient  but you cant begrudge him that servants are human beings too  yes but preferably only on their days off  titters  rings bell  so they want to take this witness business further  im afraid so its a young woman apparently  she was on her way to meet a friend by the statue of eros in piccadilly  now she swears she heard green speak as she walked by  there was clatter from traffic but she heard him say  why have you come   who was he talking to  she couldnt see  she was quite short and behind his back she looked up when he spoke   but it was only to see him fall into the road  she kept quiet  well it was in the paper and they said it was an accident  but that phrase haunted her why have you come   till she felt she had to report it  i still dont see what brings you here  sighs green complained of a quarrel  while he was staying at downton  he felt badly treated was angry about it and   he told lord gillinghams other servants  why didnt they report it  because everyone thought his death was an accident  until now  im sorry but as i remember he was in high spirits while he was here  rather too high if you get my meaning  he had the maids and footmen playing racing demon  and screaming the house down   so you had no reason to believe he fell out with anyone  none at all  he was rather a bumptious type  but if anyone objected to that it was me  isobel was asking about your travels  shes coming for dinner this evening so you can tell her yourself   another cup of tea mlord  thank you no  you can show her your sketches where are they anyway   cant we see them  now that youre back  a building company has been in touch   they want to put up 50 houses  50  modest ones hes got his eye on pips corner  he wants to widen the lane to the green   to access the village centre  they want to buy pips corner  they want to build on pips corner we take a percentage of sales   its a good offer  i wont have 50 ugly modern houses   built over a field of mine  sighs  well we dont have to make a decision now   hello darling  hello sybbie  now lets go and sit by the fire  we want to hear all about your  sybbie giggles   the police must have muddled downton with some other place  i expect so   you dont remember any bad feeling involving mr green do you  no  well better get moving theyll be down in a minute  oh mr carson theres a telephone call for mr barrow  go and find him mr molesley seeing as youre the first footman now   are you free for a moment  ive not got long  no well it wont take long  ive had a letter from my sister  the mother of my nephew archie   he was shot wasnt he poor boy  yes he was shot for cowardice  his parents live in farsley near leeds  now the farsley people are putting up their own memorial like we are   thats nice  well it is and it isnt  you see the locals only know that archie died in the war   theyll expect to see his name among the rest  yes  but the committee wont put him on the list  hes hes not worthy  apparently so says the war office  i am sorry that must be terribly upsetting for her  well it brings it back for us you see  it brings it back and makes his death nothing at all   i wish i could do something  well i did just wonder  i mean if she were able to say hed been included in our memorial  because of a family connection noone would wonder  why he was missing from the one in farsley   have you spoken to mr carson  no i was hoping you might do that   me  well everyone knows you can twist him around your little finger  then everyone is wrong   well will you have a go please  knock on door   door opens  were about to start the hollandaise   so weve got time if it curdles  right im coming  please  i hope youre not too tired after your exertions  ooh mlady im not tired exactly  oh good im glad if the wedding was a success  oh the wedding was a success  yes  spratt i have told you before i do not appreciate a man of mystery  if you have something to say say it  i would your ladyship but it may not be quite right for me to tell  well if that is the case then do no say it  do you have some other business  only that it may not be mine to tell  but it is in a way yours  youre testing me spratt  and i warn you being tested does not bring out the best in me   no your ladyship  i will not repeat myself  either impart this piece of information  if you can empower yourself to do so  or go  very well  i hope lady mary enjoyed her time in liverpool   what  i was standing outside the grand hotel this morning mlady  when i saw her come out with her suitcases  she was accompanied by lord gillingham  who had clearly also been staying in the hotel  well yes they were both staying there  they were attending an informal conference of northern landowners  lord gillingham thought lady mary might derive benefit from it  so you knew about it  laughs of course i did  why  what do you imagine you were witnessing   well  nothing vulgar i hope  nothing beneath the dignity of a butler of this house  oh nothingofthatsort mlady  sighs im glad to hear it  now if youll be good enough to let me drink my brandy in peace  your ladyship  you dont think mr bates ever knew it was mr green do you  what are you asking me for  i dont know anything you dont know  anyway mr carson wasnt impressed by the sound of the witness  but they could make out he was in london that day couldnt they  he left at dawn he was back late  theyll say he could have managed it  even if mr bates was in london we have no reason to suppose   he had anything to do with it  what do you mean even if he was   do you think he was  i dont know if he was there or not  why would i if you dont  theyll find out  about mr green   theyll find out what he did  how  theres noone in this house knows except you me and lady mary  and she wont give it away   no i dont think she will  there you are then  but theyll find out somehow  of course you must bring them if you want to   they do so love an excursion  itll be fun ill come and help  what are you going to do in london  i have a fitting with monsieur molyneux hes over from paris   the dowager lady grantham is on the telephone for you mlady  thank you   will you stay at rosamunds  if shell have me   robert any chance you could come to  im afraid i cant  ive a dreary meeting all afternoon  what about you edith im taking mr bricker up on his offer   to show me the national gallery  im watching little marigold  mrs drewe is taking the youngest boy to the dentist   cant someone else step in  i said id do it  rose  were taking my russians to howarth where the brontes lived   what will they make of the brontes  good things surely  hopeless lovers wandering over a desolate moor  if it wasnt emily bronte it could be tolstoy or gogol  thats why i want to bring them to downton  they can compare the old chekhovian vie de chateau   with the way the english do it  wont that make them unhappy  a little nostalgic maybe but they seem to enjoy that  we have some russian things here from when papa and mama went in 1874  i shall look them out what did your grandmother want  she wondered if ill have time to look in tomorrow thats all  i hope your flurry of telephonic communication  does not involve bad news mr barrow  my fathers ill mr carson  oh i am sorry will you need time off  well i ought to leave in the morning   really  if you want me to see him alive  oh my heaven  of course i do of course you must go  im sorry to hear it i remember your father very well  dont pretend you couldnt care less  ive known your family for a good long time  i may not want to be your spy but nothing changes that   if you say so  your dad was always kind to me  was he  because he was never very kind to me   youre quiet  am i i dont mean to be  i was thinking we might get out for a night when were due time off  somewhere peaceful away from here  do you ever wonder what it would be like to go  to a place where noone knows us   and just start again  why do you say that  im being stupid  thats why  i hear youre getting on well with your mathematics daisy   an extra feather in your cap  yes it is   but now i wonder  you wonder what  well should i stop there  thats enough daisy come and carry the spotted dick  good night baxter  mlady i hope you dont mind but i would like to know  whether im staying or going  youre right i have made you wait an unreasonable time  i just feel i need to plan if youve come to a decision  i have i think i have  tomorrow i want you tell me the missing element of your story  if you do ill give you a decision   is everything planned for the trip  it is   im looking forward to it  really  im afraid i find those journeys a slog these days   do you ever think of the war  what do you mean  how it was when the girls were working with the officers  and i was running everything with barrow  i dont remember mary doing much  sometimes i find myself thinking how busy we were how useful   you cant wish those days back again  well  i wouldnt admit it outside this room  what was that business about building houses at pips corner  nothing to trouble you with   so you had fun  dont ask me to elaborate  have you set the date for the wedding mlady   no  hes not trying to get out of it  no  but theres no hurry we dont have to rush into it  by the way would you do me the greatest possible favour   i will if i can  would you hide this in the cottage   you mean the thing  well i cant leave it here  suppose mrs hughes found it or edith or mama  please take it and the book  there must be a corner cupboard in the cottage where noone goes   very well mlady  thank you  but i do feel im aiding and abetting a sin  i just hope i wont be made to pay  i gather the local bobby was here today  carson said a witness had turned up whod seen that man die  but wasnt it a crowded pavement surely there were hundreds of them  this one says she heard mr green talking just before he fell  sergeant willis was asking if hed quarrelled with anyone   when he was at downton  why  mr green had told the people he worked with  that hed been treated badly while he was here   he was treated badly  i know but  we have to be on our guard  i mean im sure mr bates never knew it was him  but if they find out what mr green did then  there cant be any evidence against bates theyd have found it by now  what are you doing   nothing  is this some mysterious present for me   no its something of lady marys  what is it  thats private for her   then why has she given it to you  she wants me to keep it   why are you putting me off  im not doing any such thing  add the name of a coward to our memorial  are you quite well  mr carson surely by now we know enough about shellshock  to be more understanding than we were at the start of the war  look i dont mean to sound cruel but the lad was troubled  and off his head for all we know  im sorry for him im sorry for his family and for mrs patmore   well then  but is it fair to the millions of men  who stood by their posts up to their waists in mud  terrified out of their wits yet determined to do their best   for king and country  what do you mean  is it fair to say to them your sacrifice weighs just the same  as the man who abandoned his duty and ran for it   i  im sorry mrs hughes but i dont think its right  to make so little of the gift those young men gave us when they died  i see   i hoped id catch you before we go  oh yes  shes given me an ultimatum   whats she said  i must either tell her the rest of my story or leave  and if you do tell her does that mean you can stay  she wouldnt commit herself   so what will you do  i dont know  there is a story and maybe she has a right to hear it  but once its told i want it back in the ground and buried   then make that your condition  what  shes made conditions so can you the worst that can happen  is that she refuses and you go  which will happen anyway if you say nothing oh  you dont think hell relent  im afraid not  i just wanted to be sure you knew therell only be four for dinner  shes told you then   i have  theyd never have allowed it   is that so  but i dont want you to think im unsympathetic  yes well sympathy butters no parsnips  id better get on  whats the matter with her  shes had bad news   oh by the way mr carson  yes daisy  you wouldnt mind if i were to sit an examination would you   not now but when im ready  thats a question for mrs patmore   or mrs hughes  but you dont object  well since you ask im not convinced any of this extra work  is necessary for your place in the scheme of things  mr carson sergeant willis is here  hm  my advice daisy is to go as far in life as god and luck allow  are you sure about this im never convinced surprises   are all theyre cracked up to be  dont be silly  ill give her a treat i thought we might go dancing  i hear the new band at claridges is marvellous   does aunt rosamund know youre coming  ill tell her when i arrive  they were just going to have supper together and go to bed bates  mr carson said you were looking for me mlord  my meetings been cancelled ive decided to run up to london  would you make up a bag for me black tie not white   would you like me to come with you  no need ill be back tomorrow   mr bates  well thats it he didnt like mr bates not at all  and we know now that he said so to lord gillinghams butler  well i dont remember that he mentioned mr bates by name  he called him the valet and there isnt another is there   not now  you do surprise me mr bates keeps himself to himself   you wont mind if i talk to him  not at all be my guest  you can take a seat and ill send for him  thank you spratt  i trust you enjoyed your stay in liverpool mlady  you found it extremely interesting didnt you dear  yes i did  i think well have some tea thank you spratt  very good your ladyship  obviously its very shocking to someone of your generation  dont let us hide behind the changing times my dear   this is shocking to most people in  can we be confident that there will be no unwanted epilogue  you can be quite sure  well i must say that makes a nice  a nice what  a nice kettle of fish   is there any chance of a proposal  every chance  he already has he wants to set the date  oh oh i see  well im not saying i approve because i dont  but it does put things in rather a different light  yes   when will you announce it  im not sure we havent decided  then youd better get on with it  if i was seduced by a man  i would not let any grass grow under his feet   if hed offered to do the decent thing  i wasnt seduced granny  a young woman of good family who finds herself in the bed  of a man who is not her husband has invariably been seduced  she couldnt have gone to bed with him of her own free will  not if she was the daughter of an earl door opens  oh there you are spratt  lady marys been telling me all about her conference  i hope you found it interesting mlady  i learned a great deal that i never knew before  thank you spratt  youve had the journey to think about baxter  and i accept your condition we have time  i dont have to be anywhere till later  at the house in ovington square there was a footman  his name was coyle peter coyle  he was very handsome and after a while  i could do nothing but by his permission  he was a cruel man although i couldnt see it then  at least  i could see it really  he was nasty and he made me nasty  and i embraced it  tell me about the robbery  he handed in his notice and on his last night i took the jewels  he wanted them all but i only took some  and you gave them to him and he left  he said where to meet him the next day and i thought hed be there   but he never came  i never saw him after he got clean away  and you took the blame but why  i was ashamed  id let him change me id abandoned everything i believed  to please a worthless man   surely if you told the police now  no mlady  i wont bring it back to life leave him be  as it is hell never know a days happiness  for there is nothing good in him  so what might you have done in york that would place you there  now let me think i posted a letter to an old army pal   would he still have it  that i couldnt tell you   anything else  i made enquiries at a shoe shop   do you recall which one  browns in queen street  they were opening up then i had a cup of coffee at the royal york  i went back there for a drink later on before i caught the train home  in the middle of the day  i walked around i had a sandwich at lunchtime in some pub or other  let me think  dont worry ive got enough thank you for your time  no need to frown mrs bates just routine  but why would mr green say such things about mr bates  who knows anyway everything seems to be in order  good day to you  i dont know why mr green would want to make trouble for you  well i never liked him so i suppose he never liked me  yes but to invent a quarrel then tell the world about it  its as if he were expecting me to make trouble first  and so he was covering himself in case i did  it does seem like that doesnt it   i have to get a mark out of his lordships tails  go  of course you go  every figure shows a different kind of reverence  some eager some contemplative  some amazed  even the magpie seems to have been struck dumb  youre very sharp  umbria was full of magpies  so della francesca chose a bird known for its chatter  and made it silent in wonder  how beautiful it is  i think your picture may be a study for this angel  there are elements common to both  it was painted at the end of his life  i envy him  to be able to create something like this when death was closing in  id love to think i could still do something  that people talk about more than four centuries later  you dont sound confident  i doubt theyll remember anything ive done by the time my bodys cold   im sure thats not true  youre not but i like you for saying it  come and look at this one  im afraid im taking up far too much of your time  not true im enjoying myself  sheep bleat  mlady  mlady  are you there  mlady  wait here wait here  i didnt know where you were  oh youre back shes been no trouble at all  she should have gone when tim got home mlady   i was enjoying myself  thats very kind im sure  hey hello  well i suppose i should be off  unless youd like me to stay while you settle billy   thats generous mlady but theres no need  good  right ill be off then   can i look in tomorrow  you must be so busy  why dont i come and then you can turn me out if you like  goodbye darling   bye  bye  honestly tim  shell hear you let her get away  i cant manage it much longer  im sorry if shes lonely and wants a child   but she cant have ours  youre not being reasonable  just now i thought shed taken her  i did truly i wish wed never started it  think what she could do for the girl if shes a mind to  in 10 years or 15 are we all to live together in a threesome until then   is that what you want  me  i thought she was soft on you but its the other way round  youre the one whos soft soft in the head  she keeps being engaged i wonder if theres a fault on the line   ill send a telegram  i dont know i probably should go back   im in quite the wrong clothes for dinner  please  you said yourself she wouldnt mind  as for your clothes youll be the bestlooking woman   in the ritz dining room whatever youre wearing  oh golly   thats cheered me up  i mean it  i so want to hear what you have to say about it   i cant think why i dont know anything  nonsense  you have an instinct for the key elements of every picture  they speak to you i envy that  well i probably shouldnt but i guess i will   i wont stay out late though  dont worry  youll be home and safe as the clock strikes 12  a lot sooner than that please  but surely if bates convinced willis he was in york that day   i only said it may not be over  why not  the sergeants a nice man but hes not the brightest button in the box  according to mr carson mr bates told the sergeant  he visited a shoe shop as it was opening  the shoe shop is in queen street   oh  he also had a cup of coffee at the royal york  which operates as a station hotel  you mean he still had time to get to london and back   do you think carson registered any of this  i doubt it  and he wouldnt give mr bates away if he did  but theres a danger that sergeant willis or someone he talks to   may put two and two together  theyd still have to prove it  yes they would still need proof  lets keep a hold of that  i had such a nice evening   me too  i love london  sometimes i forget how much but i do  i remember when i first arrived   you dont want to hear about all that  but i do  london scared me at first  id only been in a school room a few months before  but my mother was eager  why especially  we werent really in the first rank in cincinnati  still less when we moved to new york  my father was jewish and the money was new  but there was a lot of it and i was pretty   i suppose i can say that now im an old lady  laughs  she thought youd make a better match over the atlantic  and suddenly here i was in these vast ballrooms  and all the other girls seemed to know what to do and what to wear   and how to flirt  i bet you were more beautiful than all of them  more original more real  laughs i certainly got a lot of names on my dance card  laughs  listen to me bragging  please forgive me i never talk about myself   why did i say all that  because im interested  well its time for me to stop were nearly there  cant we pretend were not and walk round the square again  the truth is i am quite lightheaded  going out for a night on the town  seems more my daughters territory than my own  you cant know what a good time i had  please may we do it again  i doubt it  but i hear the offer as a compliment  rosamund  i hope you got my cable   but ive had such a  such a what  nice time robert  i didnt know you were coming up to london you never gave me a clue  it was meant to be a surprise i got a table at claridges   so we could make a night of it  i am sorry   shall we telephone  dont worry i cancelled everything  when we got mr brickers telegram   wheres rosamund  upstairs she gave me your dinner and went to bed   im dreadfully sorry  so you said  wait a minute i dont see ive done anything to make you angry  no i travel to london in order to give my wife a treat  only to find shes out dining with another man  mr bricker wanted to discuss the paintings  rosamund said she needed an early night  why was it so wrong to accept his invitation  bricker was interested in discussing the pictures with you  yes is that so difficult to believe  that an art expert would find your observations on the work  of piero della francesca impossible to resist yes   it is hard to believe  im going to bed   cora  its quite all right  youve said what you think and youve every right to do so  tell me does edith seem very distracted to you   im not sure id notice  well she does to me  as if she were always thinking about something else   i might say the same of you  it can be hard to know what to do for the best  you dont want to hurt people but you may have to  i know what you mean  sorry that just slipped out   are you talking about tony  maybe  i dont know im not sure   i was beginning to think youd settled on him  i had i think  but now i seem to have unsettled  goodness i havent said it out loud before   so whats he done wrong  nothing  wed never spent much time together until recently  and when we did i began to wonder how much we really had in common  how recent was this time you spent together  very recent  are we talking about your socalled sketching trip  because i never believed in that for a moment  the point is i wasnt seeing him clearly but now i do  hes a nice man a very nice man  but not  i mean of course we talked about things  but i think my judgement was rather clouded by  by what miss elinor glyn likes to write about in her novels  maybe  but i seem to have got over that now  well i wont ask how  please dont  well ill back you up if you support me  are we talking about miss bunting or your move to america  im not sure either or both  well youre asking a lot im not very keen on miss bunting  and i cant bear the thought of your leaving  well if you love me youll support me  then i suppose ill have to  i was wondering about roses russian tea shall we go together   well when is it  this afternoon  oh good heavens id forgotten all about it   well im not sure ill have the energy  you must come  youve been to russia none of us have   did you get to know any when you were there  oh yes  oh yes   did you keep up with them  oh im afraid not  an unlucky friend is tiresome enough  an unlucky acquaintance is intolerable  youre all heart    were back  phew i was terrified you were going to miss it  no not likely by the way before i left i asked pattinson  to look out the russian things from my fathers visit did it happen  oh it did and theyll be so thrilled  if were going to do it we might as well do it properly   dont you agree mrs patmore  yes mlord   whats the matter with her  nothing for you to worry about   im not but what is it  something beneath your lordships notice   shell get over it  theres not nearly enough lemon   well shall i go down and tell them  no ill do it  tony i dont believe it   whats going on  dont ask rose wanted to invite russians for tea  and its turned into a jubilee celebration   how was london  how is it always large and noisy  lady grantham isobel   well i wanted to see you  youve spent a day in a car for that  yes  i didnt want to nag you over the telephone when if i drove up   we could make our plans together  good afternoon my dear  granny now granny theres something id love to show you  hello lord gillingham its very nice of you to come for

your displaced tsarist aristos  you could always stay if you like  lots to eat  i hope his arrival means you intend to make it public  darling granny you know how much i value your advice  which means you intend to ignore it  i wont be hurried into anything not by you or him  but if you werent certain why on earth did you go to bed with him  well in my day  a lady was incapable of feeling physical attraction  until she had been instructed to do so by her mama  i dont believe that  seriously my dear you have to take control of your feelings  before they take control of you  baxter   mlady  i thought a lot about what you told me yesterday  and i still think you should report mr coyle  i wont mlady and if that makes a difference  it wont you may stay  thank you  thank you so much  have you

russian connections miss bunting  no   im here under false pretences  nonsense youre welcome   what is that woman doing here  rose found her in the kitchen   and asked her to join us  why  dont be silly she had to  why do you let her irritate you so  how dare you say such things to me   i dont think she meant any  she curses the name of our holy father   the tsar  i said he was misguided in his policies  no no i cant listen to this  lady rose would you please arrange for us to return to york immediately  oh but before you go wont you come and see the mementoes  of the wedding of tsar alexander iis daughter  lord grantham had them put out especially for you to see  you have romanovs relics here  my parents went to st petersburg in  when queen victorias son prince alfred   married

only wants  i feel rather guilty i thought theyd enjoy the things we found  oh dear no they are enjoying them  what were you doing in russia  lord grantham was in the household of prince alfred  and we went to st petersburg for their wedding   i suppose it was very splendid  oh youve no idea  receptions and balls glittering parades  rides in a horsedrawn sleigh flying across the snow at midnight  excuse me make way make way  oh oh how funny  i wondered what had happened to that fan   that wasnt given to your father it was given to me  who by the tsar  no no not by the tsar no  no we were at a ball  in the winter palace and it was so  oh it was so hot there were icicles hanging outside the window  but the rooms were as hot as the tropics  i was wearing pale blue velvet  trimmed with silver lace  and when i gave you this fan you hid it in your reticule  in case lord grantham should be angry  good heavens  i hope you can forgive me  when i knew the others are coming i could not resist the temptation  this is amazing you know each other  you met in st petersburg  we did  allow me  to present my son lord grantham  prince kuragin  i am flattered to be remembered  how is the princess well i hope  i dont know  why dont we go back to the hall and have some more tea  yes thank you  thank you  granny has a past  thank heavens papa and aunt rosamund were already born  or we could spin all sorts of fairy tales   hows it going  there seems to be a good deal of emotion being vented  among the guests in the library but then they are foreigners  right now i must get on  stop giving me such knowing looks  i met the prince when i was travelling with your grandfather   nothing could be more respectable  whatever you say  away with your impertinent conclusions  my only conclusion is this   i know you understand my predicament far better than you let on  have you made plans to see your admirer again  drive on  im studying the glorious revolution of 1688  theyll be a glorious revolution here if you dont watch   i do hope this wont be something youll regret  i wont   you only say that to sound clever  i know you should try it  good heavens theres charles blake  i think you know lady mary crawley miss lane fox   we dont know each other exactly  we know of each other
