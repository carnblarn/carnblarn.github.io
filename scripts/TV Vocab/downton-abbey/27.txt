                housekeeper used to be mrs hughes i dont know if shes still here  leave everything to me mlord see you upstairs i wont be up before the gong  can i help stick it under my arm if you can  youre an angel i dont know about that  do you know where lord gillinghams room is the maid will show you  youve got the answer to everything i suspect you have too mr gillingham  was the train on time sir john it was all as efficient as you like  mrs jefferson how nice to see you  which ones mr sampson and why have we asked him  ah well i see him at whites every now and then and he seemed keen to come  hes over there talking to mama ah yes  whos the glamorous pirate  dont you recognise johnnie gillinghams son  anthony foyle yes but hes lord gillingham now  i havent seen him since his fathers funeral  i know but i wrote afterwards and he answered  well  how nice of you to come its good to be back at downton  mary you remember anthony foyle sorry gillingham  i remember a very superior young man  who found three little girls extremely tiresome to deal with  i seem to be outnumbered by your parents old friends  dont worry you and papa are going to get to know each other this time i promise  youre the agent here now arent you mary told me  you must miss darling sybil so dreadfully  yes did you have a good journey  im afraid toms small talk is very small indeed  not everyone can be oscar wilde thats a relief  go up when you like well gather in the drawing room at eight  ten staying and only three maids and two valets between them  not quite like before the war is it very little is  theyre mostly easy and the duchess of yeovils no trouble at all  we dont know mr sampson or sir john bullock  and we havent seen lord gillingham for a while  oh anna can you look in on mrs jefferson  theyre in the chinese  of course  oh edna lady raven might need a helping hand shes in fontenoy  she says shes used to having no maid but i rather doubt it  im not sure ive got time make time  poor lady raven  when you think of her life ten years ago and now  im told she has some dingy little house north of the park  its a wonder they still ask her to stay  well perhaps her ladyship does not wish  to cast away an old friend because she lives north of the park  i know i know but still its sad  we never moved back after the war it was a hospital you know  and now its a girls school  hmm but were quite comfortable in the dower house  did you ever see it  i remember having tea there with your grandmother  she gave me ice cream and i got it all over my dress  nanny was furious  that sounds like grandmama  shed always say how children should be spoiled  shes gone now so shell never know if i took her advice  you have no children no  no children no wife  ive come close a couple of times in fact im close now  what about you  i have a son george  you know that matthew  oh god im im sorry  of course i know i just wasnt thinking  please forgive me  theres nothing to forgive  i go this way and youre down there  oh not those bowls ivy  chilled soup should be an exquisite mouthful not a bucket of slop  ill get the smaller ones how are the squabs doing  fine mrs patmore what about the syllabubs  the orange peel and brandy is in the larder ill whip the cream during the first course  what about the savoury mushrooms peeled and cut  butters ready ill make the toast when they eat the pudding  oh my god the vegetables  shell bust a gut if she keeps that up  have you settled him in mr gillingham  i wish you could call me green my real name  mr carson wouldnt approve he believes in the old ways  what do you believe in  i believe in getting on with my work  all work and no play makes jack a dull boy and jill a dull girl  i should organise some games  ill organise you if you dont watch out  they finally got you into white tie i see  mores the pity ive never felt more stupid in my life  i was wondering why weve never spoken since i came back  i hope we can still be friends  of course of course we can  but we cant have lunch again at the pub in the village  braithwaite  edna  im trying to walk a tightrope here  as long as youre not my enemy  god no  i hope things turn out well for you i do truly  i gather the abbey is once more to be a scene of great splendour  are you going up there for any of it  im supposed to go for dinner on the last night to hear melba sing  oh i envy you but you dont sound very glad  i dont want them to spend their days in stygian gloom i really dont  they say life must go on and of course it must  but it seems disloyal to matthew  not disloyal exactly  what does lady mary feel oh you know mary  shes always quite opaque  i love al jolson dont you ive got all his records  including april showers of course i love it madly  are you ever in london i might be  were a little exposed up here to sow barley as a winter crop  the duke always swore by it  did you know barley beer was probably the first alcoholic drink  it was developed by neolithic man  so we all owe him quite a debt do we  oh theres poor lady raven i really ought to go and talk to her  of course your grace  dont call her your grace i thought it was correct  for a servant or an official at a ceremony  but in a social situation call her duchess  but why i dont call you countess  certainly not theres no logic in it  oh no if i were to search for logic  i should not look for it among the english upper class  thomas get me a drink will you for gods sake its barrow now sir but yes of course  what about a hand at cards why not  ill get them to set up a table for you in the smoking room barrow  er already done mlord  will you play lord grantham i dont think so not tonight  do you ever play well i used to  tonight id rather be with you  its no trouble we have plenty of horses and papa would be delighted  have you anything to ride in we packed it all in case  well that settles it ill send a message to the stables tonight  will you come out with me  actually i might i havent been in the saddle for ages  ill be as stiff as a board the next day  would anyone else like to go riding tomorrow morning  sir john mr sampson  must i  edith  do you ride not if i dont have to  im afraid youre stuck with me  why on earth are you doing that at this ungodly hour  where are the girls i sent them to bed  i thought i might get ahead of myself i might lay out what i need for the breakfast  all set for tomorrow i think so  where should we feed dame nellie on sunday she cant eat in the servants hall  and what about the pianist  well he can join us and she can have a tray in her room  you dont think she should dine with the house party  an australian singer  eating with her ladyship  never mind the duchess no i do not  mr molesley hello  what are you doing mrs patmore left an order with mr bakewell she said it was urgent  whats this mr molesley are you delivering for bakewells  im just filling in until something turns up  youre a delivery boy now now daisy theres no shame in hard work  you sit there mr molesley and ill fetch you some tea  you played late i hope you didnt think me rude for going to bed  no not a bit how was the game  sampson is a very skilled player  where were you last night being thrashed by sampson  poor you  i hope that means i can count on you tonight  you can always count on me  what are your plans for today  ill go to the wood look at the new planting  wont you help me entertain our guests  just give me two hours off and ill do whatever you want  were going for a walk after breakfast why dont you come  i dont think so ive got too much to do rounding this lot up  coffee  not yet thank you  im going to manage it somehow  ive a feeling hes good at putting off what he doesnt want to do  hes not as calculated as that  how little we know our own parents  apparently he took a fortune off sir john bullock  what about your employer his lordships too clever he got out the game early  thats not what i heard what were they playing  poker of course it was poker  you cant lose a fortune playing snap i could  mabel lane fox so youve caught the greatest heiress of the season  shes very nice in fact im sure  of course everyone wants it on both sides but we do get on  you may be surprised to hear that a match wanted by everyone can turn out to be extremely happy  do you speak from experience absolutely  matthew and i were flung at each others heads from the moment he arrived  if anything it rather slowed matters up  but you were happy  wonderfully happy  how lucky you are  am i  youve known a great love  doesnt that enrich any life  im not sure matthew changed me  i loved him but he changed me  if i were as tough as i was before i met him i bet id be happier now  maybe  but we cant go back can we  apparently not  what will you do with that  cover it and dry it on the stove then put it into muslin bags  lady gillinghams maid buys it in packets  perhaps shes not a country girl judging by you shes the poorer for that  youve plenty of time for chatter you can blame me  im afraid its a failing of mine i do blame you  what is the matter  i dont know theres something about him that gets my goat  he was just trying to be nice  carson were all going on a tour of the gardens in ten minutes  when we get back it might be nice to have some coffee very well mlady  is everything under control it is  its exciting to think of nellie melba singing at downton  im not sure about exciting its certainly expensive  a house party can be so flat if theres no special moment  and it wouldnt be special enough to watch the sun set by the lake  good morning ladies good morning  what is it i cant get the lid off this  give it here  ill do it  stand back let a real man handle it  come on  i wonder what happened to that real man  see told you i was master here  thatll teach you to show off  i hurt myself thank you youll mend which is more than i can say for that jar  daisy ivy clear this mess up as i assume mr clever clogs wont  im getting quite fluent  youre taking german lessons if im going to live there  no no of course  i just cant get over the fact youre doing all this to be with me  whatever it takes  michael was admiring the library its marvellous  edith tells me theres a gutenberg bible  yes its a shame our librarian mr pattinson isnt here  hes the only one who knows where anything is  if youll excuse me i must go and sort out the wine for tonight  he doesnt approve of me  he doesnt know you nor is he likely to  serve the margaux at dinner and keep the hautbrion for tomorrow  no the 99 if we have enough i want to go out with a bang  and you can choose the white very good mlord  her ladyship has been kind enough to invite the servants to hear dame nellie tomorrow evening  its a rare opportunity for them shes very generous  but i wondered what are we to do about the kitchen staff  why do you fear the corrupting influence of opera not at all mlord  but before the war they wouldnt usually have been included i think we must bend that far carson  modern times and all that as you wish mlord  ive arranged for dame nellies accompanist to sleep with the male servants  i doubt hed expect to sleep with the female ones  and dame nellie will have dinner in her room very good  whatever you think  how wonderful to see an estate thats still all in one piece  dont speak too soon what do you mean  well we have a big tax bill to pay  papa wants to sell land but id like to see if we can avoid it  the trouble is i cant get him to listen  shall i tell you what id do please  make him agree for you to meet the tax people  then bring back the best deal they can offer  in that way youll have a real case to argue  we had a similar choice when father died  in the end we let the house but kept the land  thank you  its nice to know ones not alone  that others are facing the same trials  no  youre not alone  argh whats up ive jiggered my bloody wrist  ill have no swear words in here thank you very much  unless im doing the swearing whats going on  why arent you upstairs jimmy hurt his wrist  he cant carry the tray what  ill do my best mr carson is something wrong  why are you down here whos in the dining room  im going back up i wondered what the delay was  oh no thats no good mr barrow youll have to do it  mr carson must i remind you that i am the under butler  i dont care if youre the high cockalorum youre a footman tonight  sorry mr barrow  it wasnt her husband it was a dog  im getting up a game what about you gillingham  i dont think so ill join you if you like  is there a place for me certainly  shall we meet in the smoking room in ten minutes very good  be careful if i were you sampson is a very sharp player  i think i can look after myself  it looks terribly heavy  im playing cards with your father hell have to talk to me if were at a card table  i hope james isnt really hurt i dont think so mlady good  well have to muddle through tomorrow as well  dont worry about that mlady i have an idea  you do realise we can sell land as a capital gain and pay no tax on it at all  and end up with an estate that cant support the house  i doubt it will change my mind im glad you only doubt it  i must be making some progress  whats that  is there anyone who wants to dance  i jolly well do if its with you  i love dancing but these days i havent got a partner  tom youre dressed for it  would you care to dance with me duchess i should love it  i hate to pass up a chance to hold you in my arms  why do you have to play because ive said i will  what about it  i thought id keep granny company  dont use me as an excuse if you dont want to dance tell him  do you know racing demon ive heard of it but ive never played  ill teach you well bring in some of the others  you need a pack of cards for every player we can manage that  anna can you give me a hand with this shirt ive got shoes to clean  of course  im very fond of ireland where did you grow up  bray in county wicklow  oh i love wicklow of course you must know the powerscourts  i know of lord powerscourt yes  lady powerscourt is my niece have you met her  ive seen her i wouldnt say exactly ive met her  i dont know why im doing this  by the way i took your advice and im pleased i did thank you  glad to be of service  rose  where did you get that i found it in the attic  i got alfred to bring it downstairs  im so sorry but i i cant dance after all  what was that about  the gramophone  it belonged to matthew i didnt think  what a pity  four nines  youre too good for me hes too good for all of us  nonsense ive been lucky thats all  im wondering if i ought to stop im in pretty deep im in deeper im sad to say  your luck is about to change gentlemen im certain of it  if it doesnt how do you like to be paid  dont worry im happy with ious we can settle up when we leave or at the club  besides you may have won it all back by the end  not a chance i hope you can all keep my secret  i wouldnt want to worry lady grantham  we must practise our poker face antes gentlemen  good night  how are you enjoying the party  i look like a fool  i talk like a fool i am a fool  alfred said you were dancing  with an old bat who could be my granny  and thinks i grew up in a cave  my clothes deceive no one  dont be so hard on yourself  im a fish out of water and ive never felt it more than today  good day mlord good until tonight  i took a walloping from mr sampson at poker  i was a fool to play with someone who so obviously knew what he was doing  lord gillingham tried to warn me but i wouldnt listen  do you know the gentleman well no  but i was discussing the party at the club  and he hinted a bit and i suppose i took the bait  anyway  perhaps keep it to yourself bates  of course mlord  good man  mlady whats the matter  did you know that lady rose had found mr crawleys gramophone  i did yes she wanted it for her records  i told her to ask you well she didnt  i feel very sad tonight and no wonder  she shouldnt have had it brought down and set off your memories  no its not that  at least its not only that  sometimes i dont know whom im most in mourning for  matthew or the person i used to be when i was with him  youre a fine person mlady  fine and strong and youll learn that for yourself as time goes by  i made rather an idiot of myself in front of lord gillingham  he wont mind  no  no i dont think he will  can you stop a moment please and let me out  isobel isobel my dear  will you come up tonight and hear melba  well i cant decide i i have a lot to do  look my dear i dont want to be unkind  and you have my sympathy truly  but it wont bring him back for you to sit alone night after night  i know  but you see i have this feeling that when i laugh  or read a book or hum a tune  it means that ive forgotten him  just for a moment  and its that that i cant bear  better by far that you should forget and smile  than that you should remember and be sad  but rosetti was writing about her own death not her childs  will you come  i came as soon as i got your message  i hope i didnt drag you away from anything important  oh no ive finished for the day  at bakewells  i am in a predicament  james the first footman has sprained his wrist and cannot carry  mr barrow feels the duties are beneath him  and in the meantime we have a party of 16 staying at the house  you want me to be a footman  i know it is far below your talents but you do understand the duties  and since you are working at bakewells  you mean i can fall no further  i wondered if you might do us the great favour of helping me out  i have come down in the world mr carson we both know that  i am a beggar and so as the proverb tells us i cannot be a chooser  hmm  do you know if dame nellie has arrived  i believe so mlady  but too late for tea what a shame  i was getting nervous but apparently dame nellie is here  good  are you enjoying yourself so far  seeing the house at full strength again i am  at any rate im enjoying most of it only most  i dont want sampson invited back  i think hes rather a tyke hmm  how do you find mr gregson  well sampson hammered him but he took it like a man i will say that  i hope you werent caught up in it i was more of a spectator  i hate gambling  how can grown men throw away their fortune like that what could be more stupid  i couldnt agree more  mr molesley i thought it was you are you a footman now  im having my career backwards ah mr molesley  alfred will be acting first footman so can you take your lead from him  why not perhaps daisyd like to give me a pointer or two or ivy  and here are some clean gloves that should fit you  gloves mr carson  im sorry mr molesley youre not the butler here  that is my job you are a footman and a footman wears gloves  so if we could begin  everyone ready go  hey youre pushing you cant just bulldoze us all to one side  its all part of the rules ive got the ace  someones cheating  what on earth can she be doing should someone go up and see  i thought she was going to sing after dinner she is  then why would we want to see her before  i er i suppose youll get up a game again tonight after the singing  during it with any luck  then you must count me in  youll play again if youll have me  i think ive got the trick of it now  very well if you insist dont say i didnt warn you  do you know isabella moncrieffe no  shes blown up like a balloon  shes in her room how long has she been there  her maid took her some tea when she arrived what  im about to send up dinner doesnt she want to eat with us  i didnt think it appropriate maam and his lordship agreed with me  i cant believe my ears  robert  a worldfamous singer is in our house  a great artist honoured by the king  but you felt it beneath your dignity to eat with her  i dont recall am i the only member of this family who lives in the twentieth century  what room is she in princess amelia mlady  you will have her next to you at dinner and you will like it  but what do i say to her what does one say to a singer  i blame you  now spoon it into the shells  no not like that  oh give it here mrs patmore we can do this  oh can you with ivy slapping it out like a trained seal  alfred just remember that ones for the duchess she cant eat  oh oh my god what is it  ive got a pain like a vice its like a vice  ivy fetch mrs hughes alfred help me get her to a chair  no but wholl finish the dinner  ive not made the bechamel yet nor the dill sauce for the salmon  daisy but ive all my own stuff to do ill do it  madge is ringing for the doctor what is going on  alfreds making the sauces and mrs patmores having a heart attack  im not surprised no i mean really  what on earth dont ask  molesley oh youre back im so glad  they cant keep a good man down  on the contrary mlady thats exactly what they can do  im going to slip away later for cards i hope you wont mind  not with sampson again you said youd lost a packet  well  ah its time to turn  im so sorry about earlier i hope you didnt feel wed abandoned you  this is delicious im so pleased you like it  hautbrion its one of my favourites  did you read that on the menu i didnt need to  ive made quite a study of claret  oh well then this is going to be much less uphill than i thought  ill ring tomorrow and make an appointment tom can come with me  im sure you dont need my help but its yours for the asking  thank you  may i take you out for dinner when youre in london  i dont think miss lane fox would approve  and nor would i really  but i cant tell you what a lift it is to hear that youd like to  really  is something the matter  if it is it shouldnt be  its the first time ive heard her laugh since it happened  i know and i dont want her to spend her life in sorrow  shes not the lady of shalott  its just i find it hard to join in the merrymaking  we havent all been making merry  what it comes down to in the end is this nice lord gillingham  and sir john over there and him and him and you  youre all alive  my sons dead  anna  anna  anna  are you so involved in your game you were unaware mrs patmore has been taken ill  what what sort of ill  ill enough to make this racket inappropriate  well i was going to win yes i think you were  which is a good omen what for  never you mind  why are you being like this i was just having fun  ill leave you to it please do  thank you for organising that mr gillingham it was terrific  how is she shell live  i think it was brought on by panic over all the things that had to be done  there was a lot to be done but you mustnt let it overpower you  can i listen to dame nellie i think so  but put your feet up when theyve left in the morning  you should stay for the concert  i dont want to be a nuisance but it does seem too good to miss  ill go and put my bag in the car  i dont know screaming in the servants hall  singers chatting to his lordship and a footman cooking the dinner  what a topsyturvy world weve come to  i needed something to get me through it and i see youve had the same idea  are you all right  no im afraid ive let you down  what why  since sybil died you allowed me to believe i was one of you  you are one of us now  no im not not when youre among your own people  tom somethings upset you was it the duchess  if so i wouldnt pay the slightest attention  it wasnt her fault she was only trying to be nice  it was me  i dont belong here and these past few days have shown me that  i dont accept what youre saying and cora certainly wont  but we must go now or well get stick  do any of you ever leave school    seldom from    her eyelids    where the teardrops    banished  im sneaking off i wish i knew why  you will    now i teach    my children  i hope i didnt let you down  im sure you didnt  mr carson said they gobbled it up like gannets  thats what i want to do mrs patmore  one step at a time    are flowing    oft they flow  ive got a bit of a headache  because of the singing  well its not making it any better  probably all that shouting in the game  and ill thank you not to comment  ill pop down and get something  and now for one of my favourites  o mio babbino caro by puccini from gianni schicchi  and id like to dedicate this to love and to lovers  what a relief  i thought we might have been in for some of that dreadful german lieder  you can always rely on puccini  i prefer bartok oh you would  straight to the six  flush  i dont understand how how what  sampson youre not trying to get out of paying up are you  of course not  care for something stronger  i shouldnt let mr carson see you with that  you want some  i expect youre sick of it too  a grown woman screeching like a cat on a bonfire  thats very naughty i think dame nellie has a beautiful voice  dont be silly let me pass  you look to me like you could use a bit of real fun for once  is that what you want  what i want is to go back upstairs  youre not telling me that sad old cripple keeps you happy  if you must know yes he keeps me very happy  now let me by please  perhaps youve forgotten what youre missing  argh  i wonder what shes doing  maybe shes fallen asleep  well she wouldnt get much sleep up here thats for sure  i think were both even so well leave you to it  i assume youll take an iou  firstly ill take all the ious youve accumulated during your stay  you may send me a cheque for the rest  im not sure i can allow that  or ill tell lord grantham how you won  and there wont be a club in london to touch you with a ten foot pole  will you take a note for the remainder of the debt yes  it wouldnt be in your interest to cross me  you think youre so holy dont you  youre just a cheat like me  i have won against a card sharp  there is pleasure in that  im so pleased you came so am i  i was wrong to hesitate but then guilt has the power to make all of us do strange things  oh well not all of us  guilt has never played a major part in my life  amen to that  i think these are yours  oh i cant accept this please do  i won it off sampson fair and square  fair and square eh well i won anyway  but the moneys yours i dont want it  isnt that a better way to end the house party  how did it go mr gregson has saved my bacon  but dont tell your mother  how on earth did you do that  i revived a dubious talent from my misspent youth  well that was a nice surprise i must say  my whole stay has been full of nice surprises  i cant tell you how pleased i am that i came really  then im pleased too  what is it whisky  god its huge  i thought you might need it  you understand me dont you  i like to think so  some fresh coffee mr molesley  shut the door my god  shut the door  will you help me will you find me some clothes  of course i will but will you see to lady mary  say erm just say ive gone home with a headache  i can manage lady mary but anna we must tell someone  no no no but youll have to tell mr bates  him least of all hed murder the man whos done it and then hed be hanged  but surely hes a convicted felon  do you think theyd spare him a second time no  maybe the doctors still here will you listen  i need your help or i wouldnt have told you  nobody else must ever know  you promise me  wait here  ill fetch you some water and a comb  and see what i can find you in the way of a dress  did you enjoy your evening yes i did rather  you werent too shocked having to talk to a professional singer  you always make me out to be so narrow minded but i liked her  because she appreciated your wine  there are worse reasons  and have you formed an opinion of mr gregson  yes as a matter of fact  im not sure hes what we want for edith  but its a changing world and i must admit hes a decent cove  heavens a damascene conversion  whats brought this about was it something he said  it wasnt that so much  but he did behave in a way that i thought was really quite gentlemanly  are you awake  what happened to you  i was drinking a powder when i suddenly felt dizzy and i  i must have fainted i think i hit the edge of the sink as i went down  stupid youve changed your dress  yes its badly marked  ive put it in to soak but im not sure i can save it  mrs hughes lent me this  good night mr bates mrs bates  and thank you for looking after me while ive been here  good night mr gillingham  good night mr gillingham  whats the matter nothing  i just feel like walking on my own thats all  anna  i blush to admit it but i was very drunk  so youre not going to deny it if i behaved badly i am sorry  sorry to keep you waiting but anna couldnt find oh i hope im a surprise and not a shock  i could take you all to hear the new band at the club  but tonight youve made me play truant and i like it  jack ross at your service  im rose macclare how do you do  youre trusting this man with your name and your reputation  michael i oh my darling  we live together we work together sometimes i think its just too much
