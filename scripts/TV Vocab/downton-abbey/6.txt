                last june  saw emily davison  crushed to death beneath the hooves of the kings horse  will the summer of 1914  prove as fatal for the hopes of women  it cannot hubbub  this historic byelection  has been a first step on the journey to womens equality  if youre so keen on womens rights let a woman speak  why stop there lets get the dogs up and listen to them bark   jeering  we are winning winning  you all right my lady  isnt it exciting  speech continues over jeering  youre an idiot man  i think its time for branson to take you home  not yet i think so  i applaud your spirit in coming and i will applaud your discretion when you go  but you agree with everything he says i do my dear  but i also know if anything happens to you branson will lose his place  better safe than sorry my lady  is an act of mercy i disagree  jeering the car is just here  women must get the vote mustnt they branson  why does the prime minister resist the inevitable  politicians cant often recognise the changes that are inevitable  i hope you do go into politics its a fine ambition  ambition or dream  if i do  its not all about women and the vote for me nor even freedom for ireland  its the gap between the aristocracy and the poor and  and what  im sorry  i dont mean to speak against his lordship  why not you obviously dont approve of him  not as a representative of an oppressive class  but hes a good man  and a decent employer  spoken like a true politician  chuckles  what do i look like  could you sneak me round the back  i should hate for papa to see me like this  woman where im not a mind reader  mrs patmore is very cruel to that poor girl  mrs patmore is frightened  is she right to be dr clarkson has confirmed she has cataracts  what can be done about it there are treatments  but even the best are uncertain  she doesnt want to risk losing what sight she still has  i dont blame her  but it cant go on for ever  no  oh dear  have you had bad news  i shouldnt have bothered you no  you werent to know  oh excuse me my lady  william will you find anna and tell her ive gone upstairs  very good my lady  ooh sorry you clumsy clodhopper  sorry you will be when im done with you  leave him alone anna lady sybils back from ripon  shes gone up to her room thank you  why does she waste her precious time on politics  hear hear dont you believe in rights for women thomas  whats it to you well i know you dont believe in rights of property  some people might find that interesting  whos going to tell them you  knock on door  mr carson are you all right  why shouldnt i be  you never rung the dressing gong and mrs patmores  doing a souffle for the first course  oh my god  rather unlike carson  wed better go straight into dinner  i shall tell miss obrien and anna  any more news of the byelection  mr crawley was here he said his mother had gone to the liberal rally in ripon  i heard it wasquite lively  i daresay the townies will make the usual stink when the tory candidates returned  im not sure i heard the liberal was given a hard time today  mr branson said it was getting out of hand when they left  typical branson to be there  i hope he squared it with carson who went with him  er  not sure anyone went with him sir you said they who was with him  id rather not say  bates who was with him  lady sybil  lady sybil why  i should never have mentioned it my lord i thought you knew  no i did not know  i gather you went to hear the liberal candidate today  there were several speakers actually he was the last  did he speak well  i thought so there was quite a brouhaha  you know what these things can be like i do  hence my astonishment you should not feel it necessary to ask my permission to attend  i assume this was bransons scheme no i confess  i was amused to have an irish radical as a chauffeur  but i see now ive been naive i told branson to take sybil  what are you saying sybil needed to go to ripon  i asked branson to drive her i thought it would be sensible  in case there was trouble i want to do some canvassing  the byelection isnt far off canvassing  oh its quite safe youre in a group and you knock on doors  yes i know what canvassing is i think that sybil is   what are you canvassing too  or would you rather take in washing   i was only going to say that sybil is entitled to her opinions no  she isnt until she is married  then her husband will tell her what her opinions are  oh granny i knew you wouldnt approve which presumably  is why you all hid your plans from me  her ladyshipll have a smacked bottom if shes not careful hurry up  i dont want anything else to go wrong  wheres the sauce doesnt this have hollandaise  ill get it i wont be a jiffy would you do that for me  id do anything for you  does this mean you wont be presented next month  certainly not why should it  well i doubt id expect to curtsey to their majesties in june  when id been arrested at a riot in may  but then im old things may be different now  she hasnt been arrested and it wasnt a riot  but it might be next time there will not be a next time  her ladyships not best pleased at being told off in public  william said she was looking daggers  im sorry i started all this oh its not your fault  he ought to be glad hes got a daughter who cares  her ladyships ready to leave  ill bring the car round  you pleased with yourself   silly chump  hes nervous he thinks im planning to tell mr carson about the wine  well he shouldnt have stolen it then  no  but i dont want anyone to lose their job because of me  even thomas  even after what they tried to do to you  even then  your ladyship do you have a moment of course  i have received a letter my lady  from a friend of mine hes valet to the marquess of flintshire  i dont envy him lord flintshire is a minister at the foreign office  as you know lady flintshire is his lordships cousin  oh of course of course the point is  he has dealings with the turkish ambassador  it seems his excellency has made him privy to a scurrilous story  concerning lady mary and the late  mr pamuk  may i read this letter  is there anything you want me to do about it  no thank you  sometimes even to deny these things is only to throw paraffin onto the flames  i did try to inform his lordship what  but icouldnt seem to find the right moment  quite right  please leave his lordship to me  im sorry the only sure way to get rid of a servant  is to have him or her suspected of stealing  weve tried that and it didnt work  but last time we invented a theft  we need to make him a suspect when somethings really been stolen  how do we know anythings been stolen because you stole it  you noodle you mean the wine yeah the wine  but bates knows i took it he was threatening to tell mr carson  well he cant can he not if we get in first  are you telling me you saw him take the cellar key  not exactly but i saw him in here  and i thought the key was swinging on its hook  i just wondered if any of the wine was missing  i think i owe you an apology after the way i spoke at dinner  next time you want to treat me like a naughty schoolgirl  you might do it in private not in front of the servants  youre right im sorry course it gave your mother her best evening since christmas  even so we must try to keep control of sybil  robert  believe me sybil is not your problem  weve got to support mary this year when we get to london  but its sybils first season  we cant have mary stealing her thunder  sybil will do well enough its time mary was settled  high time  poor old edith we never seem to talk about her  im afraid edith will be the one to care for us in our old age  what a ghastly prospect  mamma anna said you wanted me  look whos paid us a visit sir anthony  how nice  we all thought wed driven you away with that horrible salty pudding  no indeed laughs but i have been away  hes been in austria and germany  how interesting  interesting and worrying  sir anthonys here to show you his new car  oh yes ive rather taken to driving myself  i have to keep finding destinations to justify it  what kind of car is it its an open rolls royce  and i wondered if you might like a spin in it  oh how kind but alas not today  ive had diamond saddled and hes waiting for me  you could ride this afternoon but its arranged now  but thank you sir anthony  do ask me again  idont suppose youd take me  of course i shall be delighted  what is it that im accused of  ohnobodys accusing you of anything  but there has been a suggestion that you were handling  the cellar key and before i take it any further  i want to find if theres a simple explanation  because some wine is missing  how do you know that  right well  well leave it there for now  the kaiser is such a mercurial figure  one minute the warlord  the next a lovelorn poet  but a poet in need of an empire  thats very good  poet in need of an empire yes  my late wife used to say that  what did lady strallan used to say oh never mind  but i should like to hear it really  would you really  she used to say that kaiser bill loved uniforms and medals  but he never really connected them with fighting  what was she like maud  oh she was awfully funny  some people couldnt see it but she was  is lynch anywhere about i havent seen him my lady  my horse is lame well i could have a look at him  do you know about horses i looked after them on my fathers farm  it was the best job in the world then why did you leave it  my mother wanted me to better myself  as a second footman its a good place for me my lady  of course it is im sorry  she hopes one day that i might be first footman or even  get to be carson had better watch out  stranger things happen at sea  ive seen mr bates with a bottle from time to time  i mustve thought he was helping you  why would i order a valet to help with the wine  when you put it like that of course you wouldnt  so mr bates is taking wine  and why would this be to drink it  its not to clean his boots  thank you thomas  daisy thomas says you have something to add to this well  youre not in any trouble or any danger of trouble  you remember what you saw  i may have seen him coming out of the cellar  may  did you or didnt you  its very hard for the girl mr carson youre frightening her  im sorry  thank you you may go  thank you obrien  how is everything downstairs  all right i think my lady though mr carsons a bit cast down  oh why whats the matter with him  hes found out something about  wella person he admires  and it isnt very nice  has he said who this person is  whos proved a disappointment  i dont like to say my lady  please do if you know  oh i know  its mr bates  oh bates why whats he done  you should ask mr carson my lady its not my place to tell  papa  canbranson drive me into ripon on friday evening  i dont think so no not after the last time  oh please theres a meeting of my borstal charity  ive missed two and i simply must be there  youd have to take mary or edith with you  dont make me those meetings are deadly at the best of times  and you know what theyre like when theyre bored  why are all your causes so steeped in gloom  because its the gloomy things that need our help  if everything in the gardens sunnywhy meddle  well i agree with that  talking of sunny are you looking forward to your coming season  i am rather  hello what are you doing here  im in search of your father carson thought he was outside  hes in the library  what is it nothing much ive had an enquiry about one of the farms  ah  so  whats new at the big house  oh sybil mainly  shes discovered politics which of course makes papa see red  i admire sybils passion though  of course  but then i like a good argument papa does not  if you really like an argument  yes we should see more of each other  so its all right i can go  dog whines  will you be late  i think ill miss dinner well remember  to tell branson to take a sandwich for himself  but whos it from susan flintshire  what does she say  well prepare yourself for the worst  not the first page  my poor niece never uses one word when twenty will do  start there i am sorry  i am sorry to have to tell you  that hugh has heard a vile story about your granddaughter mary  sorry shes thrilled   now first i must ask  and i want you to think carefully before you answer  is any of this true  i see  some of it is true  how much  oh dear  she didnt drag him  i wondered about that obviously susans forgottenthe distance  between the girls rooms and the bachelors corridor  she couldnt manage it alone so how did she do it  i helped her she woke me up and i helped her  well  i always thoughtthis family might be approaching dissolution  i didnt know dissolution was already upon us  does robert know  no and he isnt going to  oh  of course it was terribly wrong it was all terribly wrong but i didnt see wha  please  i cant listen to your attempts to try and justify yourself  i know this is hard for you to hear  god knows it was hard for me to live through  but if you expect me to disown my daughter  im afraid you will be disappointed  good day  i thought you must be out here  and youd be right  i know youre upset yes im upset  ive been working here two years  and yet mr carson has no difficulty believing the worst of me  i think he has a great deal of difficulty  which is why he hasnt told his lordship yet  cant you just explain about thomas no no  it would sound like a false accusation  you cant take it lying down  because youre not guilty of any wrong  and before its over im gonna tell the world  are you  im not sure the world is listening  sorry im a bit late tonight  not to worry how are you  bearing up  this isnt the end you mustnt give up  well get there  forgive me my lady but  you dont get it  youre brought up to think its all within your grasp  that if you want something enough it will come to you  well were not like that  we dont think our dreams are bound to come true because  because they almost never do  then thats why we must stick together  your dream is my dream now  ill make it come true  why hasnt he done anything hes had the story and the witnesses  the witnesses  what do you think this is a murder mystery  mr bates cant accuse me now itll sound as if hes trying to get his own back  if i lose my job over this i swear to god ill swing for you  is there any stale bread youre throwing out  and some salt why  well i thought id make a last hot poultice for diamond  itll give him a better night you big softy  whatll mr lynch say oh he doesnt mind  he says ive got the touch  he thinks i should pack this in and be a groom why dont you  my mum  she was so excited when i came here  theyre proud of me and id hate to spoil that  do you miss em  i never had that in my childhood  someone you could always trust  well i trust them they trust me  there are no lies in our house  thanks thats enough  im glad to catch you  we have a conundrum at the hospital and i would value your opinion  of course weve been treating  the mother of your footman william mason  whats the matter with her heart im afraid  shes forbidden us to say anything to her son thats ridiculous  shes gone home now but shes still very ill  clearly the boy should go and see her  and i assume you would have no objections course not  so  do we break a patients confidence and disobey her ordersor not  we cantif shes forbidden it  i must say i agree with you  well ill tell him no you will not  she has rights too and there are rules  i dont care a fig about rules  where to from here my lady  what do you mean weve arrived the meetings in this place  this is the meeting were here for the counting of the votes  i dont understand i thought that   dont be silly branson you didnt think id miss my very first byelection  his lordship wont approve let me worry about him  i have to park the car dont move stay where you are really  i thought i gave the orders car horn toots  sir anthony strallan sir anthony  dont worry i havent got the date wrong  what a relief i could hear cora wondering if dinner would stretch   no im not really here at all  but i was driving past your gates and i thought id take a chance  see the thing is ive got two tickets for a concert in york next friday  how nice although i cant   no  i was hoping that lady edith might like to accompany me  but id love to shouldnt you ask what sort of concert it is  oh just hungry hundreds stuff mostly you know  bellini puccini rossini im not up to anything complicated  iid like that very much  excellent well its quite a hike so ill pick you up around six  lady jervas has asked us for a bite to eat after if thats all right with your mother  by all means well i must run  i hope i havent spoilt your dinner  we may have to hire a nurse after all   oh for heavens sake hold it steady if you dont want to start again from the beginning  do these biscuits go up no i put them out for the fairies  oh  of course theyre going up  whats wrong with you  youre always dozy but tonight you make sleeping beauty look alert  i was just thinking ooh blimey batten down

late id forgotten it was election night or i wouldnt have stayed  im so grateful you did oh i could wring bransons neck  what was he thinking im afraid itll cost him his job no  i told him he was taking me to a committee meeting  when he saw what it was he wanted to come straight back  youll have to stick up for him  because papa will skin him alive  are you feeling strong enough to go home  i think so  if youll take me  here wear my coat to cover the blood  youll look more normal  lean on me  thank you so much for this  by the way how is williams mother  not good im afraid shes home but shes still very weak  another attack should finish her and he still doesnt know  shes adamant ive tried to explain how hard itll be on him  but she wont have him disturbed  to hear her talk youd think he was a cabinet minister  hes made her proud  there are plenty of children in grander circumstances whod love to say the same  i wish youd tell me whats troubling you  if its this business with mr bates  its not that ill get to the bottom of that  well i hope youll do it soon  if theres one thing i hate its an atmosphere  and weve got a real atmosphere going now  its an unfair rumour which needs to be scotched  its very hard to hear the names of people you love  dragged in the mud  you feel so powerless  well i  respect mr bates but im not sure that i love him  i wasnt thinking of mr bates  knocking  mr carson have you got a minute what is it daisy  mr carsons a very busy man  i know he is but i think hell want to hear this  i told you something that wasnt true  why would you do that i did it as a favour  for a friend but i know now it was wrong to ask it of me  shes not badly hurt is she i dont think so no  thank god  better be prepared im afraid lord grantham will hit the roof  i never wouldve taken her there  i may be a socialist but im not a lunatic  im not sure papa knows the difference  youll let me know how she gets on  please  if you wish  how dare you how dare you  disobey me in this way robert im sure   are you so knowledgeable  distant ranting  papa im sorry i disobeyed you  but im interested im political i have opinions  of course i blame branson i dont think thats fair we had none of this  none of it until he set foot in our house  i suppose i should give thanks he hasnt burnt the place down over our heads  branson knew nothing until we arrived there  he leaves tonight  if you punish branson ill never speak to you again never  i dont believe this is bransons fault truly papa blame me  i do blame you robert can we do this  in the morning sybil needs rest  but if i find tomorrow that branson is missing  ill run away i warn you  oh and where would you go  well i cant think now but i will go and youll be sorry  i should be sorry very sorry indeed  approaching footsteps  how is she  shell be perfectly fine i gather youre the shining knight in all this  not really but im glad i was there so am i by heaven  if it had been left to that bloody fool branson  you should see what he reads its all marx and ruskin  and john stuart mill i ask you papa prefers  the servants to read the bible and letters from home   there are sandwiches for mr crawley in the dining room lady mary  thank you mrs hughes  we couldnt let you starve you really didnt have to  mary you look after matthew ill go up and revive your mother  do you stand by your story  i dont have a story you saw mr bates in here alone hanging up the cellar key  to me that is a story i only said i might have seen him i suppose i was wrong  and miss obrien were you then wrong when you thought you saw mr bates carrying a bottle  you wicked creature anna  you are here to watch not to participate  i dont think i was wrong no  what do you say to that mr bates  i know this to be untrue because i have no need of it  since i arrived at downton  you have never seen me drink one drop of alcohol  let us say then that miss obrien wasmistaken  mistaken my eye  and daisy we all know the value of your contribution yes mr carson  but i must ask one thing mr bates  how did you know the wine had been taken  im afraid i cannot answer that  we can drink to sybils safe return  why not  ill ring for a glass no never mind that  here  youre not very fastidious about doing things properly are you  are you  less than you might think  are you at all political  yes  but with a hung parliament its hard to get excited about a byelection  you know nothing will change  whoever gets in  if i might keep you for a minute more mr carson  if youd like me to leave no i would like you to stay mrs hughes  and you anna  you have decided  not to take action over the allegations thomas has made against me  because you believe them to be untrue  that is correct and you are right there is no truth in them  but if you were to proceed with the matter you would find them to be proven  thomas has tried to convince you that i am a drunkard and a thief  which we never believed because you know no different  until a couple of years ago i was a drunkard  and i was imprisonedas a thief  i have  repaid your kindnessvery poorly  i masqueraded as a man ofhonour  and integrity  but by any moral code  i am disgraced  that cant be the whole story  perhaps not but its enough of it to demand  my resignation  do you want to leave mr bates  no but i feel i have no choice  you owe me a say in the matter surely  if you wish  then i will consider the case  and give you my decision when i have discussed it with his lordship  until then i hope you will remain in your post  thank you for coming to sybils rescue  you were very brave  she told me you knocked a man down  i hope i did my duty  are you a creature of duty  not entirely  when you laugh with me or flirt with me  is that a duty  are you conforming to the fitness of things  doing whats expected  dont play with me  i dont deserve it not from you  you must be careful not to break sybils heart  i think she has a crush on you  well thats something noone could accuse you of  oh i dont know  i assume you speak in a spirit of mockery  you should have more faith  shall i remind you of some of the choicest remarks  you made about me when i arrived here  because they live in my memory  as fresh as the day they were spoken  oh matthew what am i always telling you  you must pay no attention to the things i say  mr bates anna  will you really leave  i doubt his lordship wants a thief in the house  now go to sleep and dream of a better man  i cant  because there isnt one  door bangs and bottles rattle in a crate  has matthew gone yes  thank the lord he was there  i hope you thanked matthew properly  i got them to make him some sandwiches  thats not quite what i meant  and he asked me to marry him  heavens what did they put in them  im serious  he proposed to me  oh my dear  have you given him an answer  only that id think about it  well  thats an advance on what it wouldve been a year ago  do you want to marry him i know you want me to marry him  what we want doesnt matter  at least its not all that matters  do you love matthew  yes  i think perhaps i do  i think i may have loved him for much longer than i knew  oh my darling  lets not pretend this isnt the answer to every one of our prayers  id have to tell him  oh  is it absolutely necessary  if i didnt id feel as if id caught him with a lie  i hope you know that really smart people sleep in separate rooms  i always keep the bed made up in the dressing room  so at least i pretend we sleep apart isnt that enough  no never mind  goodnight  oh havent you gone up yet  blow this out youre the last  goodnight goodnight  goodnight  im gonna bloody get him i dont care what you say  what would i say everything comes to him who waits  and ive waited long enough  does carson know youre here i heard you were going out  i wanted to see how he was walking lynch is happy for me to ride him  oh yes hes better but ill wait and see what hes like when youre up  william are you planning to go home soon  well its a bit far for my half day  but i can maybe get the time in july when the familys in london  thats if i dont go with you of course  i think you should take a few days off and go now ill fix it  ill speak to father and to carson noone will mind  but why my lady  your mothers not been well  how do you know i heard someone mention it in the village i forget who  i had a letter and she never said  oh im sure its nothing  i know it will cheer her to see you  wellif it wouldnt be a bother  it wont ill arrange it as soon as i get back  thank you very much my lady  she ought to spend some time with the people she loves  the dowager countess my lady  good afternoon my dear  good afternoon  theres no need to be so prim i come in peace  shall i sit here  now ive been thinking  i confess i do not know  if i would have had the strength mentally or physically  to carry a corpse  the length of this house  but i hope i wouldve done  you were quite right  when something bad happens  theres no point in wishing it had not happened  the only option is to minimise the damage  or try to  but if the flintshires have got hold of it   ive written to susan  i said it was a story  made up by mr pamuks enemies  to discredit him  even if she doesnt believe me she wont tell  in case it reflects badly on her  the ambassadoris dangerous  but thenhow many people  really go to the turkish embassy  it only takes one  well  that just cant be helped  we cant have him assassinated  i suppose  robert still doesnt suspect  oh i should hope not no our only way forward  is to get mary settled as soon as possible  i have news on that score  matthew has proposed gasps my my  has she said yes she hasnt said anything yet  except that shes going to have to tell him about pamuk  for heavens sake why  she thinks to keep it secret would be dishonourable  she reads too many novels  i mean one way or another everyone goes down the aisle  with half the story hidden  the question is  will she accept matthew  im not sure  well if she doesnt well just have to take her abroad  in these moments  you can normally find an italian who isnt too picky  well give her till the start of the grouse very well  if she turns matthew down well take her to rome in the autumn  its official  thank you for not turning against her  i know that you have rules and when people break them you find it hard to forgive  i understand that  and i respect it  in this case mary has the trump card  what  mary is family  unusual obviously  unusual its biblical  not quite  if she wont say yes when he might be poor  he wont want her when he will be rich  do you love me enough to spend your life with me  theres a war coming and war means change
