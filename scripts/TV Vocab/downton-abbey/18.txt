flowers done  yes ill check them on saturday and lose any thats going over   ive kept back a few in bud ill be home for the dressing gong   well manage   still no word from the doctor  id have told

the other night about your friends daughter    is she still looking for a place  she is   you read about the servant shortage in the newspapers  but you cant find a situation for a ladys maid not one   shell end up as a house maid if shes not careful   we cant have that if i were to tell you something  promise not to breathe a word downstairs   miss obrien doesnt want anyone to know   how will they advertise it  i dont know exactly   desirable noblemans mansion  with surrounding estate and properties    where will you go   we have land on the border with durham   it came with my great grandmother   the house is pretty we might make something of it    we could rename it downton place   who lives there now  a tenant but we can come to an arrangement   lets take a picnic there tomorrow on ediths last day of freedom   molesleys in the hall he wonders if you mind have a word   ill come through in a minute   not with you with mama   molesley   your ladyship may i have a word  of course   my lady might i be allowed to put forward a candidate   as miss obriens replacement   what   when the time comes   is obrien leaving  i hope ive not spoken out of turn  only i didnt want to miss the chance i thought you knew   of course i know thank you  ill be happy to listen  to recommendations when as you say the time comes   thank you my lady   well i must confess ill watch her departure with mixed emotions    mine are fairly unmixed  did you have a clue   not a clue   how very disappointing   but in a way it raises the big question when do we tell the staff   that the end is nigh  it sounds so final   im afraid it is final   well dont spoil ediths stay   lets get through the wedding first then tell them afterwards   oh dr clarkson    do you have a minute  er one minute yes    do you mind if we   only i know mrs hughes  is suffering from a condition  and i wondered if theres anything i can do to help  you can help by lessening her duties    but you cant tell me how serious it is  im afraid not   even if i knew which i dont   yet   good day to you mr carson   i had a telephone call from charkham earlier    charkham  reggie swires lawyer   it seems the death certificate has arrived from india    he wants to bring it here   why cant he send it   he wants to bring it   he was quite definite   i told him to come tomorrow  theres nothing going on is there  you know there is were taking a picnic  to see the house we have to move into   im surprised you of all people can forget that   hes coming in the morning i wont put him off   this is the moment when you receive a huge fortune that could save downton  and you give it away   will you choose where to give it  how can i id give it to papa  i hope in some small part of you you can understand   im trying really i am  but i cant pretend im doing very well   will there be anything more my lady  no   unless you have something you want to tell me   what might that be my lady  i wont prompt you obrien if youre not ready to say    did she tell you why  no   maybe she doesnt want until she settles  where shes going but she has let me down   we should go strallan wont be late  he never is worse luck  i know youre not happy  but edith will be in the same county   loxleys a nice house the estate will give her plenty to do   shell be a nurse and by the time shes 50  shell be wheeling round a onearm old man   are you waiting down here til they come in search of the pudding   no mrs patmore   can i do something for you  id better get back upstairs  but um while youre here  i saw dr clarkson today   im worried about mrs hughes   were all worried  but i dont think he shouldve told you   he said it would help if we lessened her workload   im sure it would but she wont be pleased hes talked about her  before its been confirmed    so it is cancer  not until its confirmed   dont say anything shed hate to think the doctor told you   he didnt tell me mrs patmore  you told me   lady edith edith tells me youre very interested in politics   tom is our tame revolutionary   every family should have one   as long as you are tame   tame enough for a game of billiards   what about it  can you tell them where weve gone  were getting used to tom and i hope you will too   we havent spoken really since it was all settled   i want you to know i quite understand why you were against it   yes well   i hope you believe ill do my best to make her happy   i do believe that   it was never personal   no of course not   no its just because of all this and im far too old   the thing is done theres no point raking it over   but are you happy about it  im happy edith is happy im happy you mean to keep her happy   thats enough happiness to be going on with   theres been a lastminute change of mind about the wedding menus    couldnt mrs patmore do it  shes given me her new order list   shes done her job its time for me to do mine   i dont want you to get tired   who have you been speaking to  noone what do you mean  nothing i dont mean a thing  now let me get on   this is a simple stitch but strong and very useful in a drama   when do we get summat to eat  as i was saying you should start it  about half an inch away from the centre line   oh im glad youve come back   i do hope youve come for our help   youd be so welcome if you have   you wouldnt say that if you knew what i am    im past help   nobodys past help   if you mean youre a prostitute you should know  it is true of every woman who has come here to rebuild their lives   im helping them and i hope i can help you too   thats right   why not come in and help us rebuild our lives   thats not why im here   that is i am a what you said  but i dont want help not for myself  but   when i make up my mind  im sorry this has been a mistake   please please dont go not again   its very strange   were leaving   im sorry mr charkham to snatch him away   thats quite all right lady mary  there will be papers to sign   yes i expect there will   papas asked anthony to meet us there  so we can all face the future together   hes bringing isobel and granny    its hard for your grandmother   its torture for all of us  and if i ever look like im finding it easy to lose my home  then i am putting on act    are you sure you can manage this  quite sure   its nothing hot  its not a shooting lunch   give them champagne thatll allow you time to set it out properly   ill manage whats this place were visiting  one of his lordships houses i wonder why theyre going there today   maybe he likes to keep a check on things   maybe    see you there   off you go   she was a cousin of grannys    do you want to come with us  yes    thank you   might i have a word my lady   of course what is it  this is a slightly awkward request   what with the wedding tomorrow   tell me   mrs hughes is very tired   i wonder if it might be possible for you to divert some of her work my way  i dont understand  what do you mean tired  cora   carson  the fact is mrs hughes is ill  my lady she may be very ill   im extremely sorry to trouble you with this  at such a moment but i dont want the wedding to sink her   of course not but how will we manage  without obrien and now mrs hughes   miss obrien  she told molesley  cora please   im coming   mrs bartlett  ive brought the money   its your loss cos ive got nothing to say   all i want to know is if vera ever   oh so you were on christian name terms were you  you do surprise me   if mrs bates ever suggested she was depressed or unhappy   of course she was unhappy   her husband had left her and gone off with a trollop   hed changed you know she was scared of him by the end   and now we know she had good reason   when did you last see her  youd better come inside   bates   watch out    what do you mean  search your room search your bed   theyve set you up your cellmate and his mates   stop talking  just do it   her door was open so i looked in   she was cooking but she had to post a letter  so we walked me down the street   she said bates was coming back later for his tea   she was terrified   she was in a strange mood  jumpy fearful  but determined   shed made pastry she scrubbed it out of her nails  like she didnt care if she took the skin off   so after she posted the letter she went home on her own  she did poor soul and i never saw her after   i can remember her now walking away down the street   it was raining no not raining more like drizzle   the gaslight seemed to catch a sort of halo around her   a halo really  you can laugh   when did you hear she was dead  next day   somehow i knew it was bates   when i heard the verdict i thought hed swing   he shouldve if the country hadnt gone soft    this is very good of you   nonsense we were on the way    i wish youd let me sit in the front   i prefer it ive ridden   in the front seat many times   arent you a wild thing  theres never been a safer method of travel   nor a faster one   ediths the speed fiend she likes to go at a terrific lick   do you think youll be able to keep up with her   ill try   whats this place like do you know it  a little my late husband kept the shooting there   wed sometimes have luncheon in the house   is it nice  nice enough as a retreat from the world   i wouldnt have thought it suited to much else   downton place   how lovely   wont it be a bit cramped   you do realize that for most  people it looks like a fairy palace   well be able to run it with a much smaller staff   this is it we wont need more than eight servants tops   so itll be very economical it   what about me where am i to go   we still own most of the village   oh perhaps i could open a shop  good idea granny  what do you think it needs  if its like everywhere else good manners and decent conversation   then you should have a roaring trade in minutes    hows everything going  very well   its unfair mary had an archbishop to marry her  and youve got poor old mr travis   i dont mind its such short notice he was booked up   i prefer it really to have the man who christened us   what did charkham come for  he gave me a letter from swire   he left one for each of the three potential heirs  when and if they inherited   mine is the only one to have been delivered   what did it say  i havent opened it   i cant decide whether i will   why wouldnt you   because i know itll be a paean of praise  how lavinia could not have found a better man etc    and you dont want to read that  she could not have found a worse one   no i dont i feel bad enough and if i read his words  they will stay with me forever    mrs crawley  were back from our delicious luncheon  and i was on my way home   you had a maid at downton ethel parks   i was here when she brought her son into the dining room    who could forget that  do you have an address for her  i do if shes still there   you see   you see i saw her this morning  and im afraid shes fallen into a bad way    a very bad way  oh dear   i am sorry to hear that   if youd like to come with me ill fetch it for you   thank you  get up both of you against the wall  mr turner search the bunk please    nothing here  what  clean this mess up  bastards  theres a lot of bastards in here   i expect youre tired   its a long day up to london and back   worth the journey not really   miss obrien might i ask what youve confided in mr molesley  but have kept from the rest of us i dont know what you mean   mr molesley has given her ladyship the impression youre planning   a change of some sort   whats this  im sorry i thought her ladyship would know   know what  that youre leaving   i beg your pardon  how dare you make such an assumption  isnt it time for the dressing gong mr carson   it certainly is   but   excuse me mr molesley  ive got work to do  even if you havent   ill deal with you later   youre in the soup i wouldnt be in her bad books for a gold clock   you mustve said something molesley misinterpreted   i say nothing to him beyond pass the salt and out of the way  there must have been something   i do feel let down and right on top of the wedding    you sent for me my lady  yes   thank you obrien   mrs hughes i understand that youre not well   whom do you understand that from because if the doctor   it wasnt doctor clarkson   it is not confirmed that i am ill your ladyship   ive had a test and im waiting for the results  but i am perfectly capable   mrs hughes i only want to say one thing  that if you are ill you are welcome here for as long as you want    lady sybil will help us to find a suitable nurse   i see   i dont want you to have concerns about where youll go  or wholl look after you  the answer is here and we will   i dont know what to say my lady   theres isnt anything more to say until we know where we stand   thank you   he thinks i dont know but of course i do   well spend two weeks in rome then florence then venice  so i couldnt be happier   what about loxley is there masses to be done   its not too bad   its not too bad downstairs  the bedrooms are killers   dont do anything too fast it takes time to know how a house works   you really should go to bed  no bride wants to look tired   it either means shes anxious or been up to no good    i wont sleep a wink   tonight or tomorrow  sybil vulgarity is no substitute for wit   you started it   miss obrien  please understand i didnt mean any harm   why make it up in the first place   i didnt make it up i was told   who told you  mr barrow mentioned it but i think it was an honest mistake   no it wasnt honest and it wasnt a mistake  but dont worry about it i can tell it wasnt your fault  so well forget about it shall we  and when you see mr barrow  you can tell him i may make some honest mistakes myself    no doubt well find out   probably the hard way    why not eat with us  oh i couldnt do that   daisy wont sit down the invitation is not in your gift   she eats with mrs patmore in the kitchen   fancy a game of something later  daisys busy    anna  i want to write a letter sorry    ill play  lets see how we feel   what do you mean youve read it  i didnt think it was right to destroy a mans last words without reading them    it wasnt your decision   i made it my decision    do you want to hear what he says  no   lavinia must have written to him on her last day   hours before she died   nonsense no letter was in her room   she wrote to him after she tried to persuade you to call off the wedding and you wouldnt  this is quite impossible   she loved and admired you for the sacrifice of your happiness   she commended you to my care    i cant listen to any more of this   you must   i have few intimates so have added you to my list of heirs   its unlikely ill outlive the first two  so theres little chance of you reading this   if you do and the money has come to you  know it is with my full knowledge of what transpired   do not allow grief guilt or regret to hold you back in its employment   god bless you my boy reggie    are you sure you didnt write it  i assume you know his hand  not well enough to test a fortune in it  im not accusing you of faking it  but i suspect someone has   so it wont change your mind  not yet it wont   time you were in bed  its a big day tomorrow   ill just finish this   is there something i can do for you  no   did you say anything about me to her ladyship  i dont know what you mean why  dont worry  she was very kind and   i was touched   as you know i dont worship them all   like you do   i wouldnt put it like that   but this time i freely admit it  i was quite touched   am i interrupting no please i just want to ask you all something    im sorry ive not been up  dont worry ill change after luncheon   i had to catch you when you were all together    how can we help my lady  its a funny thing   mr crawley has heard miss swire sent a letter  on the day she died if so someone must have posted it for her  and we wondered if it were any of you   im afraid not given that the poor lady passed away that same day  an incident of this sort would have been reported to me   or to mrs hughes   thats right milady  i see well thank you very much    what were that about  she wanted to know if anyone had posted a letter   for miss swire   oh i did that   daisy what did you say   post miss swires letter she asked me to put it in the box in the hall    why  what were you doing in her room  making up the fire we started talking shed written a letter   she was ever so nice i still get sad when i think about her   and it didnt occur to you to tell me  tell you what  never mind i am grateful to you daisy   you cannot know how much    well this is the last of them   im glad theyve hurried it  so she can be married from downton   are you a little sober reflection would not have gone amiss   mama lets try to be positive   of all of them anthony is the most traditional choice   robert edith is beginning her life as an old mans drudge   i shouldnt think a large drawing room much compensation    why dwell on that now   to have the pleasure of saying told you so   now the moment you feel tired you tell me   ill take over whatever it is youre doing  oh will you now  are you sure you want to come to the church  you could stay here and have a lie down   it would be so nice  if people would wait to learn if i really am ill before boxing me up   i dont know what you mean  i dont know anything about any illness    dont you  i see    who told him  i dont know   maybe he just picked it up somehow  hes worried about you   hes a good man  hes a hopeless liar   thats quite nice really isnt it  ive had a message from the doctor   hell have the results tomorrow   im to call in the afternoon   try not to worry    ill try but i wont succeed   thats it ill put the hat on later   go straight to lady edith   you look marvellous  i feel marvellous   that is i feel marvellous because we dont have to leave downton   lavinia did write to her father and it was posted from this house   in other words every word mr swire wrote in that letter was true   daisy posted it   the kitchen maid    i see  do you my darling  i hope so because if you try to find one more excuse  not to accept the money ill have to beat you about the head   i see   i do have one condition however    make it a good one   lets not steal ediths thunder   ill tell robert after its over and shes left on honeymoon   now that i can live with   you look beautiful   all of us married all of us happy   and the first baby on the way   lets get a picture of the three of us when we get to the church   he looks as if hes waiting for a beating from the headmaster   do you think i should reassure him  how hes done it before so he must be in possession of all the facts   perhaps the first lady strallan was a difficult act to follow   or a difficult one to repeat   well fashionably late is one thing   are we going in edith i know we havent always got along  and i doubt thingsll change much in the future  but today i wish you all the luck in the world   thank you   oh look   thank you very much   good afternoon   good afternoon my sweet one   dearly beloved we are gathered    i cant do this   what  i cant do it    you know its wrong you said so   my dear chap   no i shouldnt have let it get this far   i shouldve stopped it long ago  i tried to stop it   what are you saying  i dont understand what youre saying   edith   edith i cant let you throw away your life like this   what do you mean  were so happy arent we  were going to be so terribly terribly happy   you are going to be happy i pray that you are  but only if you dont waste yourself on me   anthony it is too late for this   might i suggest we take a step back  no let him go let him go  you know hes right   dont stop him doing the only sensible thing in months    thank you lady grantham   but granny  its over dear dont drag it out   wish him well and let him go    i cant   goodbye my dearest darling  and may god bless you   always   but   oh quick   when everyone gets back can you clear all this away  i want it gone before lady edith comes downstairs everything   ask the outside staff to help put back the carpet and the furniture   is there anything i could say to make it better   no   look at them with their husbands   sybil pregnant mary probably pregnant   just go   i mean it go  perhaps you should go   oh mama   you are being tested  and do you know what they say my darling  being tested only makes you stronger   i dont think its working with me    what shall we do now  theres nothing we can do  beyond removing all signs of a wedding  and holding her hand while she recovers   she will of course   meanwhile its time to face the business of leaving downton   without the wedding to hide behind theres no reason to delay it  and astonish the world with the extent of my wretched failure   actually  mary and i intended to make an announcement at dinner    what announcement what about  you dont have to leave   ill explain it later but   im going to give you reggies money   ill accept it ill give it to you   dont be silly youre not going to give me any money   i am you dont want to leave   nor does mary   nor do any of us for that matter   i still wont take your money   what i will allow is for you to invest in the place   if we stay youll share the ownership itll be your house  your estate as much as mine  we will be joint masters   and if you wont agree i will sell and it will all be your fault   i never thought id feel sorry for an earls daughter   all gods creatures have their troubles    anna  yes  do you think its right women should say what they think  speak out about romance and everything  well things are changing for us and the vote wont be long now  so they must get used to us speaking our minds    but what  with most of the men ive ever met  if you started to court them  theyd be so terrified theyd run a mile    has she had something to eat  anna took up some sandwiches   she didnt touch a thing   that reminds me carson i dont want edith to see any wedding food   mrs hughes and anna are taking whats left to mr travis tomorrow for the poor   if the poor dont want it bring it over to me    how can we help edith  by finding her something to do   is this all were getting the pickety bits  hardly these are canapes alfred   for your first course truffle egg on toast perhaps  oysters a la russe    then what  theres lobster rissoles in mousseline sauce   or calvadosglazed duckling  or maybe a little asparagus salad  with champagne saffron vinaigrette   when i think how youve gone to such pains   what about the pain of that poor girl upstairs  jilted at the alter  i couldnt stand the shame   then its lucky noones ever asked you   poor thing how will she find the strength to hold up her head  id have to run away and hide in a place where noone knew me    shes well out of it   how can you say it  shes young shes not bad looking  she could do much better than that brokendown old crock   sir anthony may have betrayed a daughter of this house  but he doesnt deserve to be addressed like that by a footman   oh i think he does  every bit of that and worse   well maybe just this once   right whats it to be lobster duck or asparagus  is there any cheese  what would you like me to get you  a different life   let me bring you up some breakfast   no   im a useless spinster  good at helping out that is my role  and spinsters get up for breakfast    going out  just into the village   i have to fetch something   can i help  im going down later   no thank you   this is an errand i have to do for myself   ready  as ready as ill ever be   you can be sure of one thing   i wont be cured by standing here    do you want   no   everything all right miss obrien  oh yes everythings all right with me  but itll be all wrong with you before too long mark my words   oh and how is that miss obrien  i dont know not yet  but it will be   you can be sure of it   well  is it or isnt it   its not cancer its a benign something or other nothing more   dont mention that youve said anything   she doesnt know that i know   i wont say a word   did you tell him i would prefer to say i put him out of his misery   dashing away with the smoothing iron  she stole my heart away  dashing away with the smoothing iron  she stole my heart away   i havent had a letter from mr bates in weeks   he wants me to make a new life without him    am i to answer to you both  i have made an investment thats all   you abandon a pregnant woman in a land that is not her own while you run for it   other men have normal families   no family is ever what it seems    tell them im all right   sybil hello
