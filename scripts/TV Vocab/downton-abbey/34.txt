miserable to me he just looks like himself  what is your objection to mr macdonald that the prime minister is the son of a crofter  i couldnt care less if he was the son of fu manchu  what worries me is that our government is committed  to the destruction of people like us and everything we stand for  well lets wait and see what happens before we panic  wheres edith she had some old lady to see in the village  what about you is everything settled at the school whats this  they swore in mr adams replacement on the school board it all went off smoothly  i thought they might have asked me i feel guilty about the school  i ought to support it more  well im giving away the prizes this year come with me  barrow can we clear the tea  lady ediths missed it and nanny will be down shortly  id better

in factories or shops they like the hours better  oh ill forget my head next  i came in to remind you its their  so if you want to do a cake this is an advance warning  i suppose therell be a dinner

darling  i do wonder where she got her colouring but i never knew her parents  no no  her mother was an old friend of tims but i never met either of them  oh is that the time we mustnt hold you up  good girl  good girl  i should probably go have you got your teddy  say goodbye  goodbye  thank you for thank you  shes got a soft spot for you  dont be daft  i do love this evening light  oh i must tell lord merton  tease me if you will but i dont want to be pursued by him or lord anyone  well thats a pity  hes asked me to help him in his courtship  what he doesnt want to pester you  so hes asked if i could give another luncheon party  oh dear oh why the lamentation  you dont have to see him  well you make it sound so easy  theres nothing simpler than avoiding people you dont like  avoiding ones friends  thats the real test  but i do like him i think hes very nice  its just he wants something from me that i cannot give  he just wants what all men want  oh dont be ridiculous  i was referring to companionship  as i hope you were  oh i didnt mean to disturb you  im sorry its a letter from lady anstruther again  blimey she doesnt give up easily  well you know me irresistible is my middle name  well was she like this when you were working for her not as bad  she had to be more discreet with the other servants  hadnt you better go up to london and put her out of her misery  oh dont tempt me  because i know this if i weaken ill pay for it  this sounds very like the kind of boys talk i do not allow  if you can both tear yourselves away from your smutty deliberations  i need you both upstairs  where is she i hope im not late  no carson hasnt come in yet that reminds me  were to receive a village delegation tomorrow i ran into the postmistress  she asked if they might pay us a visit  mrs wigan what was it that reminded you  she asked for carson to be present why whats it about  they want to erect some kind of memorial to the war what  well not to the war but to the men the local men who died in it  theyll be all over the country i suppose they want me as chairman  who was it tony gillingham  he had some business up here and you told him he could stay  when does he want to come thats the problem the 16th  and its our anniversary  oh that doesnt matter ring him and say yes  we dont have to no id like to see him  right thats dinner everyone  you dont mind tony coming do you not if its what you want  ill tell you what i want i want to inspire tony gillingham with thoughts of marriage  so does that mean lord gillingham wins and mr blake can go whistle  im glad for them viscountess gillingham  it sounds quite smart  i think theyll be happy and itll be good for master george  its a big thing to take on the task of raising another mans son  theres nothing to worry about there his lordships a kind man  i wish youd tell me what you know about those two  i dont know anything  what you suspect then and dont deny it because ive seen you  you cant stop looking at them when you think noones looking  can i join in do you have to  how was it in york did you find what you were looking for  i did took a bit of a search but i think im suited  whats that then oh just something  a groups arriving from the village tomorrow morning  can you get one of the footmen to bring coffee and something to eat at 11  well find me when you want it i cant im in the meeting myself  thats why im telling you now  whats it for i dont know but his lordship asked me to be there  well i think its fantastic  when did we last have a prime minister who understood the working class never  its a qualification that is meaningless in terms of government  im not sure i can agree with you there i think its important  me too mr macdonald will have real experience of a hard life  he knows what most people go through  up the workers so james is a revolutionary now  hes not a revolutionary he believes in justice for the majority whats wrong with that  nothing but i suppose he can fight his own battles  well have no fighting here thank you very much  you wouldnt mind heading the warmemorial appeal would you  i feel a bit embarrassed i wasnt wounded i wasnt even allowed to fight  they should ask a man like general mckee or johnnie raymond someone who did their bit  youre their traditional leader and they like you to pray with them in mourning and in gratitude  but i should be praying in the back row not the front thats all  please dont think us too forward you have no need to worry  im happy to play my part  but we dont know yet where we want the memorial to be mlord so  well if youre to give us a piece of land youd better know where it is before you agree  im sure i will agree but is that why youre here  to ask for a piece of land as the site for this thing  thats why were here to see you mlord  but wed also like to offer the position of chairman of our committee   ill take over now you were saying  wed like mr carson to be chairman of our committee  but surely his lordship  no carson they dont want me  they want you  i wouldnt put it like that mlord  but mr carson knew more of the young men that died than you did  yes i suppose youre right well he knew them better  thats it and hes a considerable figure in the village  tea please  carson what do you say i am honoured by the invitation  but i shall have to think about it  of course you will but please dont take too long  can you put my milk in first if thats for me  did that come in the second post it did  from lady anstruther  not again whats stoked her up  my fault i shouldnt have sent her the valentine  yes but that was  and i sent her another this year  how did she know they were from you because i bloody signed them oh  i dont know what i was thinking it was supposed to be a joke  but well now its got out of hand  dont worry  one day ill be a good boy and settle down we all settle down one day  we dont all have the option  heavens i wasnt expecting you  ive been to see smithers at oak field farm i just thought id look in on my way home  im glad you did  i had a delegation from the village  about the new war memorial theyre putting up  oh they want you to head it no  theyve invited carson to be the chairman  well why not you the village wanted carson  your father always told the village what they wanted  hmm  is it true old dicky merton is paying court to isobel  isnt it absurd  oh it might be rather fun for her to reinvent herself as a great lady of the county  and put us all in our proper place  yes i suppose it would be fun  but you dont think shes keen  oh no far from it she never tires of telling me  daisy this came for you in the post  thank you mr carson oh what is it  something i ordered  may we know what o queen something i need  why must it be a secret  well it would be a bit sad if she had no secrets at her age  have you made your decision about the memorial  oh not yet  im not comfortable being placed ahead of his lordship  you should have seen his face mrs hughes he felt very let down  its the committees choice and theyve chosen you  and the countrys chosen a labour government so people dont always get it right  what are you afraid of  i feel a shaking of the ground i stand on  that everything i believe in will be tested and held up for ridicule over the next few years  mr carson theyve been testing the system since the romans left  oh i suppose thats true  the nature of life is not permanence but flux  just so  even if it does sound faintly disgusting  there you are mlady madge said you were going out  we were giving a turnout to the blue room  and this had been put on the shelf with the other books  what is it a german primer but the point is its not ours  mr gregsons written his name in the flyleaf i see  i nearly gave it to her ladyship but it seemed more suitable   no im the one who should have it  can you please put it on the table beside my bed  of course thank you  good afternoon good afternoon thank you molesley  its good of you to come with us  i must have something to do  wheres your mother in the library  im not sure toms visiting the school is such a good idea  he made a friend there of one of the schoolmistresses when we were in london  whats wrong with that  i dont intend to explain but i was rather disappointed in him i would have hoped for better  youre being very mysterious cant i know the details  you really dont need to  there you are how were they  as dull as ever they sent love  what was the meeting like have you accepted  it wasnt me they came to see well they want me to give them some land for the thing  but they asked carson to be the chairman  carson well how nice  im going upstairs to take off my hat  well shes pleased anyway  congratulations  im sure you will want me to thank lady rose for consenting to present the prizes today  were always glad of interest from the abbey  and finally thank you all for coming  it is most appreciated  im glad peter won a prize for geography well done him  he didnt get that from his father  is mrs drewe with you no shes at home looking after the young uns  we ought to talk but not here  tomorrow at 11 by the stone barn  youve been away ive been on a course  i nearly wrote to tell you but i thought it might be presumptuous  well im pleased to see you back thats a relief  i thought i must have earned a black mark making you take me up to the house that night  hello miss bunting lady rose well done  oh its not exactly difficult  giving out prizes i think we get thanked too much  but thats the custom isnt it  we ought to head off if were to be back before the gong  the rule of the gong it sounds like life in a religious order  goodbye  ill see you again i hope so  spratt  offer dr clarkson some cake then you may go  thank you  im afraid serving me is a bit beneath his dignity  even spratt cannot always live for pleasure  how well do you know lord merton  erm i dont really  oh  because i thought you might be amused by how friendly he and mrs crawley have become  what mrs crawley chooses to do with her private life is her own affair  oh dear ive annoyed you  no no no im not annoyed  although i am surprised to learn that she entertains notions  of passing her time at drawingroom receptions  and taking carriage rides in the park  well noone takes carriage rides in the park any more  thats quite gone  i wouldnt know  you ought to meet lord merton properly  come to luncheon on saturday  mrs crawley will be here and so will he  well thats quite an honour lady grantham are you sure  oh itll be fun im hoping to persuade dear lady shackleton  to be one of our number  mamas gone to bed she wanted an early night i might go up too  come and sit here for a minute  it doesnt really bother you they want carson does it  theyd be lucky to get him  even so it makes you think  would a village delegation have arrived in my grandfathers day  to ask his butler to head an appeal  were not living in your grandfathers day no we are not  so they dont want me at the school and they dont want me for the memorial  well i want you  i think you tom and i make a pretty good team  by the way ive been looking into crop rotation and grain sales   and not every father hears that from his daughter  mr barrow  im tired of waiting miss baxter  im tired of being bullied  i got you this job and you knew what i wanted in return  so dont complain about it now  thank you madge good night  did you know dicky merton was in hot pursuit of isobel  mama says shes desperate to throw him off  i wonder what do you mean  i dont believe your mother would enjoy the transformation of isobel into lady merton  complete with a living husband a proper house and a solid position in the county  that would not suit mama at all  oh dont be ridiculous shed be thrilled if that was what isobel wanted  daisy whatever are you doing up at this hour i thought youd gone to bed long ago  i just wanted to look at these  what is it  you can tell me  arithmetic part 1 cost accounting what is this  i was rubbish at numbers at school  well all the best people were rubbish at numbers at school  but i dont know anything you talk about my working at mr masons farm but how  i couldnt balance the books if my life depended on it  why do you need to because i want to be grown up mrs patmore  i want responsibility i want to be an adult  i cant just stand here following orders for the rest of my life  well i do see that  the trouble is im too stupid to make out one solitary word  youre not stupid daisy far from it  then why cant i understand whats written why cant i follow it  because  because im a pigignorant idiot  good night mrs patmore  is this your secret lair  its not very secret but this is where i work  and where you can hide away from the rest of us  why do you never ask that miss bunting up to the house  maybe i will one day  you live there too you know im not sure where i live  i feel sometimes im hanging in midair  well you mustnt think we dont want you to have your own life  i dont think that of mary or edith or you  but it would be hard for lord and lady grantham  theyd have to get used to it easier said than done  id better get on  so i have your permission to accept  you dont need it it has nothing to do with your work  no but i wouldnt want to think it was disagreeable for you  wed be delighted carson  youll be able to steer it through the perils of village politics  but traditionally i feel it should have been you mlord  maybe this will be a new tradition  i know you hate not to be wanted but youre on so many committees  what do you mean i hate not being wanted  you think im taking too much of an interest in marigold  its margie she thinks im there too often  because youve got a crush on me  well thats better than the real reason  the real reason is a good reason to love a child mlady  mothers should love their children  how long have you known since you asked me to take her in  but youre quite safe  its not my place to judge you and i wouldnt anyway  but i should control my feelings  i could say yes but i dont believe its realistic  i dont believe you could  then what are you saying  we need a way for you to live the truth without telling the truth  the die is cast ive accepted  his lordship told me to take it  there you are then but he was sad  not with me but maybe because things are changing  well they are whether were sad about it or not  i hope youre right about lord gillingham  what would i have felt if id inherited a family with you  youd have loved them i hope i would  but i cant deny id prefer one of my own youd feel the same  well they do say a mothers love is the strongest love there is  but thats all in gods hands theres nothing we can do  i can think of one thing mr bates that sort of talk is beneath you  i stand corrected  ill have it out of you fancy a breath of air before the gong  thank you mr molesley  whats the matter with you youve not said a word all afternoon  i went to the village and telephoned her to reason with her  and i think it were a mistake  it was never going to put her off  exactly  the trouble is she hates getting older  and i think thats at the bottom of it  still its pathetic for a lady to be pining over a footman  excuse me  i think it shows very good taste  my dear lady shackleton how kind and youre on your way somewhere  i am and i cant stay im dining with philip  and his wife sulks all night if youre a minute late  you should write a book daughtersinlaw and how to survive them  i like yours yes cora does very well  even if one cannot always rely on her instincts  id exchange her for mine in a trice  tell me how well do you know lord merton  oh you know weve seen each other at parties for 40 years  i worry that hes finding things difficult since his wife died  youre a widow you know what hes going through  i suppose so but i never saw them as very devoted  i should have thought he was glad to be rid of her i would be  then his sons are quite difficult  i know what thats like  could you come to luncheon on saturday help me cheer him up  well id love to oh  of course a single peer with a good estate wont be lonely long  if he doesnt want to be  you sound like mrs bennett  but whats he on about he thinks i know something about mr bates  and do you maybe  mr bates may have done something he wouldnt want known  do you mean a crime or  im not sure i know he took a journey which i think hed deny  look i dont want to know any more  but a pound to a penny  mr barrow thinks he can use it against mr bates  report him to her ladyship shed soon put a stop to it  i cant  its complicated but i cant  what is it  whats what youre doing something funny with your head  sort of tilting it  im not am i how do you think i look  why have you got a rash  no ive not got a rash  thats all right then no what i meant was  how old would you say i am  i dont know maybe 52  oh why how old are you   ive just had the strangest telephone call  oh do you remember lady anstruther  you mean jock anstruthers widow thats it  her sisters lady renton and her brothers harry mountevans  i do remember her goodlooking and half jocks age and rather silly  well silly or not shes just rung up and asked herself for tea oh  do people think were a public house on the great north road  it certainly seems like it  shes driving through the village on saturday and would love to see us  what did you say well its only tea  are we doing anything for your anniversary  what had you in mind well now that tonys staying  i thought we could invite some people make an evening of it  well you girls ask some friends  id like a young party for once instead of all those old duffers  hello  oh mary ive got an idea  i think its sharp of daisy to want to learn to manage figures  im afraid i agree with mrs patmore  why does she need to shes a cook  cooks have to balance their budget  she can learn enough for that without being an expert in algebra  she may not always be a cook  possibly not but she wont be archimedes either  sorry but i dont think we should encourage it  im going up i want to read a bit before i turn out the light  oh well done with your studies daisy  its good to have more than one string to your bow  its even better if you dont have the brain of a kipper good night  see what did i tell you shes lost her confidence because of it  and no mathematical skill is worth that  why must lady anstruther choose saturday of all days  ought we to invite her to the dinner  isnt she staying somewhere else  tell me tomorrow whos coming of your pals keep the numbers even  well rose wants to invite a friend of toms he must feel so outnumbered  not that brother i hope someone local rose has met her  so have i shes quite respectable  i think it would be nice  looking forward to seeing lord gillingham  i only saw him in london last week so i can remember what he looks like  but i expect its difficult to get time alone in london  less difficult than when i was a girl  but yes itll be good to see him here  i havent made up my mind if thats what youre thinking  i wasnt thinking anything but i suppose youll have to some time  the older i get the more i feel we do these things very oddly  even now we must decide whether to share our lives with someone  without ever spending any real time with them  let alone you know  of course these days some women do  i was talking to lady cunards daughter last week  and she was so graphic i almost fainted  but then what could be more important  to make sure that that side of things is right  before we tie ourselves to someone for ever  im afraid im too oldfashioned for you mlady  i need hardly say youre not to repeat a word to bates  of course not mlady  what do you make of this  blimey what does that mean  as you know lord gillingham arrives today but theres been no mention of a valet  there was enough mention of the last one poor mr green a terrible end  lets not rake over that now  as i say his lordship may have a valet but these days we cant be sure so  yes mr carson  not you mr bates would you keep an eye on him if necessary  certainly mr carson  mr molesley have you have i what mr carson  er never mind  arms down relax  im sorry theyve only just told me you were waiting  oh ive not been here long  i wanted to see you after i read your letter  it wasnt meant to be confusing  no but why wont you come  because i dont want to be part of some sort of a prank  what prank  i may not have been presented at court lady rose  but i do know its usual to be invited to dinner by the hostess  and shouldnt mr branson have played a part in it  lady grantham asked us to invite some younger guests to liven up the evening  so mary and i thought it would be nice for tom to have a friend there thats all  im right then he doesnt know  no it would be a surprise for him but a nice surprise  and lady grantham is aware of this  completely she wants you to come  i could have managed lord gillingham no need to burden mr bates with him  i think mr carson forgets that im a valet too  i know and it seems a bit ironic for mr bates to dress him  why is it ironic i dont know why i said that  why did you say it miss baxter  er it was rubbish nonsense  now if youll excuse me im late  oh how nice i wanted to call on you but i didnt like to be a bother  ive been quite busy lately helping with the outpatient clinic  dr clarkson oh lady grantham  may i present dr clarkson i think you know lord merton  i think we have met yes  we were talking about your clinic oh you mustnt bore him  as a matter of fact id be interested to  the lady shackleton  oh my dear how prompt you are  your daughterinlaw has trained you well  now you remember lord merton  of course how are you  and hows that lovely garden of yours  oh still lovely largely because i have the same lovely gardener  i dont think weve met since dear lady mertons funeral  i do hope things are sorting themselves out  youve gone to a lot of trouble mmm i like to help where i can  oh spratt shall we go in  lord gillingham ah here he is  tony welcome lovely to see you all  im afraid youve missed luncheon i ate on the train  a cup of coffee then that would be perfect  carson i must congratulate you  theyre building a memorial in the village and carson is the chairman  i like the idea of these things to give people a solid focus for their grief and gratitude  i agree my lord i hope his lordships happy about it  my being chairman i mean  he is or at any rate he will be  so how are the famous pigs doing pretty well  theyre earning their keep and more  im going out this afternoon to get some rabbits for mrs patmore come with me  ill find you a gun and you can see what weve been up to  ill come too although i warn you  im not very good at picking up  well if im shooting you wont have to  that i do not believe  could you spare me for an hour i think everythings under control  i just want to run down to the post office i wont be long  so will you be travelling north in august for the grouse  you talk as if my sole concern is the sporting year dr clarkson  the truth is these days i hold a book more often than a 12bore  you must miss it not particularly thank you er  as a matter of fact hes more interested in medicine than sport  i find that hard to believe  you sound a little prejudiced not at all  he seems a nice enough example of the type i grant you  er  but as you say yourself were not members of that tribe you and i  spratt  i think dr clarkson would like some coffee  and dont be such a snob  im determined to get you over to sheriff hutton  the children are in the main house now ive been banished to a cottage  did you move before hubert died no  to be honest i didnt want to go at all but ive got used to it  apart from anything else ive never been warm before  morning  so why did you talk about mr bates and lord gillinghams valet  whats the connection tell me  theres no point trying to find mr molesley  because he cant help you now  if thats how you want to play it  ill give you until upstairs dinner has finished  after which i will ask to speak to her ladyship and i will tell her your story  do you hear what im saying  i cant tell you what i dont know  but you know something  and i think it links mr bates to the dead valet  im impressed by what ive seen  toms a good partner so im lucky  im the lucky one  tom what about your american plans oh i dont know nothings fixed  but never fear mary is more than ready to manage without me  thats your man  so youre not frightened of being left on your own to control your papa  i understand him better now and i think hed say the same of me  so hes not fighting all change then  no but he likes proper research  you see i want to improve how we sell our grain  if i make a good case for it hell agree  how positive you are  ive decided to live in the present and not spend my life  regretting the past or dreading the future  i shall try to follow your example  do you dread the future  only if i have to live it without you  tony i do love you you know  in my cold and unfeeling way  then why not say yes  i dont want to get it wrong  id like to marry again ive come that far  but i intend to be as happy with my second husband as i was with my first  its bound to be a risk on some level  you have to take a chance  the stable clocks fast we ought to get back  by the way bates will look after you if you havent brought a man of your own  oh thats rather a luxury for me these days i have no valet now  our butler takes care of me at home but when i travel i usually fend for myself  do you mind it makes things simpler  id love to make our lives simpler  hm  its a nightmare when guests are a nuisance and i feel so guilty  but i wasnt sure we were even going to make it down the drive  but what happened exactly well there was this terrible noise  a sort of rattle rattle bang bang  and then the engine just seemed to lose its power  well get tom to take a look at it oh how kind  but i think my chauffeur weaver seems to have it in hand  could i just use your telephone  and tell my hosts i wont be able to get to them tonight  but what will you do oh we passed a public house in the village  and i asked weaver to see if they had any rooms  you cant possibly stay at the pub why not im tougher than i look  you must stay here we have people coming to dinner so itll be easy  oh yes its perfect oh thats sweet  molesley you look very latin all of a sudden  do you have italian blood  no mlord not that im aware or spanish or irish  james please tell mrs hughes that lady anstruther will be staying  if she could prepare princess amelia  very good your ladyship  go now tell her everything you dont know what youre asking  i may not know your story but i do know itll be worse if mr barrow tells her first  yes youre right  thank you  why is she here they dont know her do they  well if they do she never told me what are you going to say to her  who says ill get the chance to say anything go on have it out  shes playing with you like a cat with a vole  james did you know about lady anstruthers visit  no mr carson why should i didnt you work for her one time  im sure ive got a reference from her somewhere  but that was quite a while back wasnt it  well shes made extra work for everyone  thats all i know  what do you mean you need to tell me something before barrow does  mr barrow wants to tell you about something in my past mlady  ive a secret you see a bad secret  i dont understand what secret how does he know it  i was a friend of his sisters when we were young  but if he knew something wrong about you why would he put you forward for the job  i think you had better tell me  very well  a few years ago i worked in london as a ladys maid  for a mrs benton who lived with her husband in ovington square  go on  i was there for about six months and then i  and then you what  i  took some jewellery belonging to the mistress  a necklace a couple of bracelets some rings  you took them  i tried to make it look like a burglary but it didnt work  and mrs benton reported the theft  they took me up a few hours later  my fingerprints were everywhere  and to make it worse  i never gave the stolen things back  why not  because by then i didnt have them  what happened  i went to prison for three years  thank you baxter  very good mlady  what do you make of our mysterious visitor  tom said he went to look at the car and could find nothing wrong  maybe the chauffeur mended it maybe  we ought to go down  will there be anything else  i dont think so thank you its been quite a treat  you dont travel with a valet these days mlord  no no when green died i never replaced him  we were all shocked by the death of mr green so soon after he was here  yes of course  had he been with you long not very long no  right thank you  well i told her  now im not asking what you said but i want to be sure that you held nothing back  good  how was she i dont know  shocked but not unkind  then his lordship walked in so that was that  the point is if she allows you to stay  youre here in a truthful way and not in a lie  and if im not allowed to stay  well youre still not caught in a lie  thats what matters  i will tell you the story one day  but im loath to forfeit your good opinion and i know i would  no you wont  you dont trust me yet but im on your side  mr molesley i need that up in the servery now  yes mr carson  jimmy i ought to scold you  why did you ignore my letters youre a very naughty boy  show her ladyship where to find the drawing room james  of course  will you come this way mlady  i feel so guilty pushing into a family celebration  youd be an ornament at any gathering oh how nice thank you  no cocktails i thought everyone had them now  not at downton our butler tried them once and he hasnt recovered  oh look at your parents   thats the advantage of an older husband one gets an early release  miss sarah bunting  what on earth is she doing here  i asked her cora said i could  have i done something wrong shes the teacher i told you about  after her behaviour while we were in london i dont think shes a suitable guest  let me introduce you kitty colthurst sarah bunting miss buntings a teacher  oh golly how clever what do you teach  the usual things writing mathematics  crikey writings almost beyond me and i wouldnt know where to start with mathematics  well then you must marry someone rich enough to ensure you never need to  oh what are you doing here  lady rose invited me rose did you ask lord grantham  wasnt coras permission enough  how are you im exhausted  two parties in one day is too much for me  was your luncheon a success you must ask cousin isobel  weve cast the net wide tonight  cant tom have a friend of his own oh of course  but its time he decided whether he is fish flesh fowl or good red herring  well i think its nice to see an intelligent face here  miss bunting has been shocking us with her support for the prime minister  but surely most of the country must support him or he wouldnt be prime minister  there is an unanswerable logic in that oh quite  theres an alliance that does not bode well  i quite agree with you arent you being very snobbish  were being realistic  something your generation has such trouble with  her chauffeur says theres nothing wrong with the car that he could find so theres a mystery  see shes here to see you i dont know what she wants  dont you because i do its embarrassing  i have a feeling it could get a lot more embarrassing  if you dont find a way to keep her quiet  take that  marriage is a lottery as we are often told  but i am a man who has drawn a winning ticket  i have been awarded a bumper prize  beauty brains a heart a conscience all in one  i give you my cora the best companion in the world  mama lady grantham  what a tribute indeed if only it were true  whats happened to molesleys hair  carson lady mary tells me that youre to lead the memorial committee  that is so madam yes youll drive it splendidly  rose is that friend of yours terribly clever  shes toms friend not mine but i think so yes  she certainly thought i was terribly stupid  well lets not shoot her down for that  no thank you  do you know that footman yes he used to work for me  its always nice to see a friendly face  especially a friendly pretty face  im not convinced these memorials are a good idea  but i suppose thats a different issue  why not wont they give people a focus for their sorrow  and a reminder of the sacrifices that were made  if it were a memorial service then i might agree  but a stone edifice on the green  to remind us for ever of death and a pointless war  whats the good of that  to say nothing of the waste of money  forgive me but youre talking nonsense  forgive me but i suppose shes allowed an opinion  not that opinion not in this house i think what she means is   she is here as your friend so of course you must defend her  but was the war worth fighting  what did it achieve beyond the russian revolution  millions of men dead and no more justice than there was before  you are wrong both of you  but we must strive to keep things light  its a pity they didnt want you on their committee  you put up a stout defence of their intentions  they do want his lordship on the committee  forgive me my lord  id have told you later but they held a meeting this afternoon  and they would like you as their patron  oh how nice i dare say that was always their plan  i dare say it was your ladyship  i should be glad to accept  now if you can all put your swords away  perhaps we can finish our dinner in a civilised manner  but i admire it when young people stand up for their principles  principles are like prayers  noble of course but awkward at a party  james did my eyes deceive me  or did lady anstruther pass you a note during dinner  yes mr carson can i see it  hes thrown it away she just wanted to remind him that he once worked for her mr carson  even so its most irregular  but it wasnt his fault was it he could hardly slap her hand away  get that up to the drawing room  i gather from mr molesley that you gave the good news to his lordship  ah that is correct how did you get them to agree  i said i wouldnt serve if they didnt make him patron  and have you told him that  he doesnt need to know everything mrs hughes  nobody has to know everything  ive enjoyed myself  both gatherings were interesting in their different ways  you get on well with lord merton i know that  i do but cousin violet had other plans for him at luncheon  where is granny  she said goodbye to your mother but she wanted to slip away  the day of parties had taken its toll  before i go i want to meet the staff downstairs  you dont think youve made enough of a statement  what about you i know i got a bit carried away  i thought you were splendid cheer up  youre putting quite a dampener on the evening  really i thought only imbeciles were happy all the time  here she comes the boudicca of the north riding  thank you so much for having me  it was a pleasure wasnt it robert  i want to thank your cook before i go and the other servants  im afraid theyll be sitting down to supper and we dont like to disturb them  i wont be more than a minute of course you must go down  theyd be delighted  i assume you heard the way she spoke to me at dinner  of course but how does it help to answer rudeness with rudeness  is everything satisfactory mlord no it is not  and can you please keep molesley in the kitchens until his hair stops turning blue  what are you doing  setting out the breakfast trays for her ladyship and lady mary  not lady rose and lady edith  unmarried young ladies eat breakfast in the dining room oh do they  thank you again and im glad to meet you  i felt i had to put faces to his stories  what stories are those oh thats a dangerous question  we may not like the answer  do you work in the school i teach mathematics handwriting and spelling mainly  you must be so clever i wouldnt say that  come and meet the others goodbye  thats such a different path it is  but it doesnt mean its better than the one youve chosen  your ladyship might i have a word  im very sorry to say it  but ive learned something that makes me feel both responsible and guilty  would this have to do with baxter  because if it concerns her criminal record then i know all about it  do you mlady  what i dont understand is why you placed a convicted felon  in my household in my bedroom  when you knew every detail of her past  i wanted her to have another chance  dont you think that should have been my decision in my own house  yes mlady perhaps it should  so why tell me now because if you have been using your knowledge against her  ill have to consider your future here  indeed whether you have one at all  i just thought id been wrong and you ought to know  i see well now i do  good night  you think youre so clever dont you  has miss bunting gone  yes she got a lift down to the village with mrs crawley  that was nice of her  i wanted to apologise for arguing with you at dinner  you were nothing compared to her  she has her views  thats true  but i must confess they remind me of how i used to feel  is that what you want tom to go back when youve come so far  ive come a long way from who i was thats true  and is it a bad thing   were not lovers you know  what  that time when you were in london  you thought that wed got up to something we never did  as sybils father this is not an easy conversation for me  but if i was wrong then i am sorry  the truth is i worry less about that  than if miss bunting is taking you back into the role of rebel and hater  im not a hater  i dont hate anyone  least of all you  well that is a more cheerful note to say good night on  isis  but why didnt you give the jewels back  you say you didnt have them by then but who did  more than that why did you do it at all  you dont strike me as being greedy you were working you were earning  did you dislike mrs benton was she harsh  no mlady she was a kind woman that only makes it more mysterious  i wont start concocting excuses for myself there are no excuses  there may not be excuses but there is missing information  youve shocked me baxter profoundly i cant deny it  you have every reason mlady so am i to take it that i am dismissed  your work is excellent and i have never sacked a servant  that gave me no cause for complaint  have i your word you will not commit this crime again  i will never commit any crime again not as long as i live  you may stay until i make a decision  i cannot tell you how long that will be  and i do not at all promise ill keep you on  no  very well  i think we should leave it there for now  i hope we dont have to see too much more of miss bunting  lady rose told madge she liked her  and she seemed nice when she came downstairs  maybe but she makes papa say things he doesnt mean  and i know he hates himself for it afterwards  mr molesley  i do not know why you have treated your hair with a special substance   well i  but i can only say  that the effect on your appearance is not what you would have it  take steps mr molesley take steps  you will remain below stairs until you do  well so lady marys not quite so ladylike after all  me next  you think im mad dont you it doesnt matter what i think  maybe she just wants to talk maybe im the missing tsarevich  the trouble is i cant resist it not when its offered on a plate  well youre not alone there  now if you can stay with her until three  youll get back to your room without being noticed  ill watch until youre in there if you hear me speak just keep walking past her door  thanks mr barrow  thomas i mean it  youre a real pal  well i try to be  but tony you really shouldnt be in here  of course i shouldnt why are you then  because youre in love with me am i  well you said so yourself you were torn between me and charles blake  but i think youve decided and im the winner  well thank goodness thats settled  the trouble is you want to be sure  well surer than the customs of wellbred courtship will allow  go on i want you to come away  just for a week maybe less  but on our own and well spend the days talking  and the nights  well spend those together too  i want us to be lovers mary  i want us to know everything there is to know about each other  and then after that i believe you will be sure  if papa was here hed hit you on the nose  im trying to convince you to marry me  thats not the normal purpose of seducers  i dont think hed see it that way  what do you say to my scandalous suggestion  noone must ever find out  fire what  fire oh my god george  ive got sybbie and george  thank god mary you take them  tony go with her tom come with me  you know where the sand buckets are kept  good god barrow is she all right  i think so mlord we must get her outside  quickly tom  tom get the hose  rose wake mrs hughes and the maids shell do the rest  we must alert the firemen who knows where to find drewes number  i do and save the dog  barrow hurry up get her away from the smoke ill check the bedrooms  let me check the rooms mlord now man  fire  theres a fire  well ill see you both downstairs  everybody outside theres a fire  james james wheres james  peter look in the bathroom for james  mr molesley hurry along please  here tom  mrs patmore do be careful  dont worry dont worry  well take over now mlord  thank you  how are you feeling all right i think  but ive been terribly stupid  dont worry about that now  lord grantham i may sneak away before breakfast  would you forgive me i have quite a way to go  perhaps that would be a good idea  mlord  barrow we have to thank you   for raising the alarm and rescuing lady edith so bravely  what were you doing on the gallery  oh just keeping an eye on things well thank goodness you were  i was angry with you before and i was tempted to take it further  but i accept that you have earned our goodwill by your actions tonight  thank you mlady  whats going on whats happening  dont worry its almost over  mr bates wanted to come to see you were safe we were so worried  were fine lady edith chose to set fire to her room but were fine  ill see if theres anything i can do  hes calmed down now but he was in a real state  he does get so worked up about things  i can imagine  i dont wish to be harsh but i have a feeling  james would be better employed elsewhere  oh please dont ask me why i think so  but i suspect his ambitions rather outstrip what a career as a footman will yield  as your lordship wishes give him a good reference  we dont want it talked about  understood mlord  all clear now mlord no real damage beyond lady ediths bedroom  well thats something  we can all go back inside  the excitement is over  might lady edith sleep in his lordships dressing room tonight mlady  since the beds made up  of course  im just going to thank the firemen papa right  have you had any ideas yes and its a simple one  you are going to take a great interest in little marigold mlady  of course we just need to introduce the notion carefully  so everyone accepts and believes it  youre to sleep in his lordships dressing room tonight  and well see what can be saved tomorrow  thank you mrs hughes  you have heard the voice of his majesty king george v  im sorry if ive hurt you  and the mist is clearing around the lithe figure of tony gillingham  you do know shes a thief there must be more to it  mrs crawley has been distracted lately  with lord merton frisking around her skirts  i didnt kill him personally i didnt shoot the imperial family  is this what they call a lively exchange of views
