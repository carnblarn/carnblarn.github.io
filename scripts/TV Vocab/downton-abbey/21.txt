                 thank you  i know we sound like parrots tom but i would like to help if i can  so would mary  my wife is dead  im past help  but thank you  the guests looked for you to say goodbye  i was here  i hope youll let me know if theres anything i can do  anything at all  thank you  ill come with you save him getting the car out twice  youre both very welcome to stay for some dinner i dont think so  grief makes one so terribly tired  goodbye my dear  now that its over try to get some rest  is it over  when one loses a child is it ever really over  cheer up mr barrow a long face wont solve anything  leave him alone he knew lady sybil better than any of us except you  we were the two who really knew her  i must say your grief speaks well for her  thank you for that thank you for saying that  are you sure you wouldnt like this in the dining room maam  no thank you id like to eat quickly and have an early night  how was the service  oh quite nicely done  but you know how it is when you bury someone young  when you lose your child  theres nothing worse under the sun  i was wondering if i might try to take her out of herself  perhaps give a little lunch party nothing formal  just lady grantham and the girls  and i could cook something special  well we dont have to decide that now  but i dont understand why they havent let him out  mr murray hasnt been to see mrs bartlett yet  and when he does she may not want to repeat the things she said to me  she must be made to repeat them  even then would we have enough to overturn the verdict  how can we prove she was cooking that pie not something else  because something else would have been found  look im not saying itll all be done by tuesday  but this is the moment weve all been waiting for  whats the matter  its so nice of you to say we  i mean it  we need some good news in this house anna  and this is it this must be it  i thought i might move back in here tonight if youll have me  not yet i think id rather sleep alone for a while yet  well if youre sure im sure  cora lets not go through it all again im not arguing  you listened to clarkson and so should i have done but tapsell has a reputation as an expert  and you believed him dr clarkson knew sybils history and he did not  you believed tapsell because hes knighted and fashionable  and has a practice in harley street  you let all that nonsense weigh against saving our daughters life  which is what i find so very hard to forgive  do you think i miss her any less than you  i should think you miss her more  since you blocked the last chance we had to prevent her death  ill say good night then  good night  hows the baby doing  i envy her she doesnt know a thing about it  you ought to think about getting a nurse  mrs rose will leave once the babys weaned  perhaps a local girl but im not staying  or at least just until i find a job  well theres no rush god no  toms right he has to start to make a life for himself some time  some time yes not right away  and anyway now that the funerals over  we ought to think about the christening  do you know what youd like her to be called id like to call her sybil  of course  you dont think it might be a little painful  very painful at first but i think its right  i want to remember her mother whenever i look at her of course you do  and she would want to be remembered  ill go and see mr travis this afternoon  why mr travis  to fix the date  but sybil will be catholic  what  my daughter is irish and shell be catholic like her father  its time i started my morning  mrs patmore  oh ethel  mrs patmore i wonder if i could ask for your advice well i  i suppose you know im working for mrs crawley now i had heard  shes been ever so kind to me and id hate her to suffer for it  shes hired me as cookhousekeeper but to be honest my cookings a little rusty  oh yes  shes giving a lunch party to help her ladyship in her sorrow  shell tell me to keep it simple but id like to surprise her  our ladyship mrs crawley wants to show sympathy  i know you dont want to stop her of course not  might you help me prepare a few dishes tell me how to make them ill do the work  please look i dont mean to be rude or personal ethel  but mr carsons made it very clear that noone from the house is to have dealings with me  youre not afraid ill corrupt you are you i am not  then why should mrs crawley be punished for showing me kindness  you dont look as optimistic as you did bates something wrong  not that im aware of mr durrant really  you seem downcast  i wondered if some scheme to improve your lot had gone awry  if you know something to suggest my fortunes have taken a turn for the worse  perhaps youd be kind enough to share it with me  am i kind enough to share it with him craig  no  i dont think i am  did you hear about toms announcement at breakfast  he wants the child to be a leftfooter  papa i know its hard there hasnt been a catholic crawley since the reformation  she isnt a crawley shes a branson  the only chance that child will have of achieving anything is because of the blood of her mother  well i dont agree  and besides sybil thats another thing  i think its ghoulish to call her after sybil well i dont  no theres no need to cook  just fetch some ham from mr bakewell and make a light salad  you cant go wrong with that  and lady grantham wont want more  id like to make a bit of an effort to show our sympathies  its a nice idea ethel but id like to keep it safe  ill walk up to the house later  what is your plan for the child what do you mean  well if branson takes her away  to live with him in liverpool or wherever he comes to rest  presumably it will be his influence that governs her upbringing  i hadnt thought about that then i suggest you do  and soon  what does cora say  not much not much to me anyway  she still holds you responsible  shes wretchedly unhappy if thats what you mean  i will not criticise a mother who grieves for her daughter  i think shes grieving for her marriage as well as for sybil  robert people like us are never unhappily married  what do we do if we are  well in those moments  a couple is unable to see as much of each other as theyd like  you think i should go away  or cora could go to new york to see that woman  it can help to gain a little distance  i i cant seem to think straight about any of it  my dearest boy  there is no test on earth greater than the one youve been put to  i do not speak much of the heart  since its seldom helpful to do so  but i know well enough the pain when it is broken  thank you mama  dont you have any work to do ill clean the silver later  mr carson told us to wait for him i wouldnt mind your hours  whats the matter  you look very very what  i dont know exactly stop gabbing ivy  remember youve my work to do tomorrow you off to see the rich farmer  whatever he makes he earns it itd be nice to be your own boss  no farmers his own boss he takes his orders from the sun and the snow and the wind and the rain  oh i see is this the new servants hall  what have they done with the old one i wonder  what are you staring at a cat can look at a king  well not at a cook get on with whatever youre doing ill be back before the gong  i dont know what im doing here  youre here because youre kind am i  this is a list of what youll need  ill come in on thursday and see how youre getting on  can i really do it salmon mousse  anyone who has use of their limbs can make a salmon mousse  lamb chops portmanteau i dont know  surely you can cut up a bit of chicken liver and some parsley  why not serve bread and cheese and have done with it youre right ill give it a go  forgive me for barging in but i have a little plan  oh goodness youve changed its much later than i realised  were rather prompt  roberts invited mr travis to dine with us  what was your plan i was wondering if you and the girls might come to me for luncheon on thursday  do i count as one of the girls  of course  youre very kind but im not really going out at the moment  therell be noone else there only me  and a walk to the village might blow some cobwebs away  im afraid i would only bring my troubles with me  hello mother what brings you here  shes just invited cora and edith and mary to luncheon on thursday  oh how kind thank you  isobel have you come for dinner  no im dressed quite wrongly and you have a guest  i doubt mr travis has much of an eye for fashion  oh do stay we need cheering up  can you manage course i can  sorry didnt mean to insult your manhood  she didnt mean that either get on  are you looking forward to your outing with mr mason i am its a lovely place  you should go with her or i could come out with you  the trouble with you lot youre all in love with the wrong people take those upstairs  isnt there something or other unenglish about the roman church  since i am an irishman thats not likely to bother me  i cannot feel bells and incense and all the rest of that pagan fodder is pleasing to god  i see so is he not pleased by the population of france or italy  not as pleased as he is by the worship of the anglicans no  south america portugal  have they missed the mark too  i do not mean to sound harsh  im sure there are many individuals from those lands who please him  and the russians and the spanish  there must be many good spaniards  we havent started on the nonchristians the whole indian subcontinent  the british empire does he approve of that  if you mean does he approve of the expansion of the christian message yes i think he does  and so do i poor mr travis youre all ganging up on him  you and granny are ganging up against tom not me  the dowager duchess of norfolk is a dear friend  and shes more catholic than the pope  i simply do not think that it would help the baby to be baptised into a different tribe from this one  she will be baptised into my tribe  am i the only one to stand up for sybil what about her wishes  sybil would be happy for the child to be a catholic how do you make that out because she said so to me  on the day she died  did she oh god did she really  im flabbergasted youre always flabbergasted by the unconventional  but in a family like this one not everyone chooses their religion to satisfy debretts  ive no wish to persecute catholics but i find it hard to believe theyre loyal to the crown  itll be a relief for them that you no longer want them burned at the stake  i dont believe in orthodoxy thats a long word  a man can choose to be different without it making him a traitor i agree  i dont like discussing religion well only fall out  its our private business amen  its funny though all that latin and smoke and men in black dresses  im glad im church of england me  really what do you feel about transubstantiation you what  never mind alfred your hearts in the right place  i cant say that for everyone under this roof  when sybil was talking about the baby being a catholic  did you get the sense that she knew  im not sure  not at the time  of course ive asked myself since  youd think wed be used to young death  after four years of war  thats why we must never take anything for granted  which is what im trying to get robert to see  he wasnt given downton by gods degree  we have to work if we want to keep it  but not only downton  us  we must never take us for granted  who knows whats coming  well i have to take one thing for granted  that i will love you until the last breath leaves my body  oh my darling me too  me too   maggie  what  meet us down the pub later  but this is quite different from the story told before  i dont think it is im afraid so  you said you went to mrs batess house after youd eaten your evening meal  and she was in the process of cooking hers  i had just eaten when i saw her thats true  but it was dinner at midday  mr bates was going to call on her that afternoon  but er  you described how the light from the gas lamps  caught the rain and made a kind of halo round her  that sounds rather fanciful for me so you do not remember saying it  i dont remember because i never said it  i see  as a matter of interest why did you let me come today  if nothing you could say would alter the verdict  i thought it was time you saw how real people live  wheres daisy gone off to play the milkmaid  do you like dancing everyone likes dancing  i love the foxtrot dont you its all right  what about you alfred alfred wouldnt do the foxtrot would you alfred  he takes himself too seriously for that well i love it  i think it makes you glad to be young  me run this farm are you serious  not right away but eventually  but im a cook you think theres no cooking on a farm you could do a cracking trade  with jams and jellies and cake and all sorts  you could sell em at the fairs  but im a woman are you  well i never knew that  there are widows who take on a tenancy  youre liked in the big house theyll not refuse you  i own the equipment all the stock  and ive quite a bit put by  its hard work but youre used to that  i cant answer now no of course not  but think on it  and think on this and all  my dream would be if you were to come here  and live with me so i could teach you  but i always thought id spend my life in service  you have 40 years of work ahead of you  do you think these great houses like downton abbey are going to go on just as they are for 40 years  because i dont  you wanted to speak to me lady grantham yes  on a melancholy matter im afraid please  i want to talk a little more about the death of my granddaughter  a terrible terrible tragedy  but now i am concerned beyond that  oh are you worried for the child no not especially  she seems quite a tough little thing  dr clarkson my daughterinlaw is quite convinced  you could have saved sybil had you been allowed to  one can never speak of these things with any certainty  well this is the point what was the likelihood of sybils survival  had we operated she might have lived  there are cases where an early caesarian saved the mother after preeclampsia how many cases  not many i admit id need to do some research  i want you to tell lord and lady grantham what you have almost admitted to me  but but there was a chance  dr clarkson  you have created a division between my son and his wife  when the only way they can conceivably bear their grief  is if they face it together  so you want me to lie to them say there was no chance at all  lie  is so unmusical a word  i want you to review the evidence  honestly and without bias  even to ease suffering i could never justify telling an outright lie  have we nothing in common  its badly run it makes no sense to manage it separately  what about the tenant wed look after him  hes growing barley and wheat  hed do better with sheep exactly wed merge the grazing  how do you know that how do you after spending your growing years in manchester  ive been on a steep learning curve since arriving at downton  my grandfather was a tenant farmer in galway blackfaced sheep  so theres a country boy inside the revolutionary  not much of one  you must hate it here  no i dont hate it  but i dont belong here either  what will you do i thought of liverpool  there might be something for me there  and the baby  ill hire a woman or get a cousin over to take care of her  i dont know  what else can i do  you could leave her here  no ill not be separated from her  shes all i have left of her mother  right you know what youre doing  i think so yes  use an alarm clock to remind you when to put things in the oven and when to take them out i will  youve done well ethel  maybe youve also done yourself a favour  im very grateful  i expected her to deny everything  the moment she realised her testimony would release me  you know she did say every word of it of course  but im afraid someone tipped her off before i went to see her  i think i know who  the question remains as to what we do next  i wonder what mrs bartlett is thinking at this moment  that shes glad mr bates is still in prison im not sure  its a big thing for a woman like that to lie to a lawyer  to flout the law  they would have bribed her to do it or frightened her  well we cannot offer a bribe  but perhaps we can try to persuade her  into returning to the path of truth  let me see what i can do nothing foolish  you mustnt do anything stupid promise me  leave it with me mr murray  i dont understand i can smell cooking  its quite simple maam youll be pleased i promise ive had help  and i suppose theres no ham and no salad  if this luncheon is a failure ethel i shall hold you responsible  im sorry if ive kept you waiting  its good of you to spare the time ive only the men to cook for today and theyre easy  what were you doing at crawley house  who says i was at crawley house i saw you coming out oh i see  well mrs crawley was giving a luncheon party and i  and you were helping ethel i suppose i was  against my strict instructions to give the place a wide berth  now mr carson noone disputes your position as head of this household  but im not sure youre entitled to dress down mrs patmore in this way  if mrs patmore wants to spend her time frolicking with prostitutes  do i look like a frolicker may i ask whos expected at this precious luncheon  her ladyship the young ladies and the dowager  you have allowed a woman of the street  to wait at table on members of our family  i am speechless  i would guess he wont stay speechless for long  i need to spend a day with the agents to talk it through  jarvis has a lot on his plate yes of course but  must we discuss this now its very boring for tom i dont  tom is your soninlaw and his daughter is your only grandchild  none of which gives him a word in running this place or would you involve carson or the maids  i really we have to act if we are to avoid another crisis  capital is leaking into the cracks caused by bad management  bad management  well discuss it later  my lord i wonder if i could have a word cant it wait  no my lord it cant  mr carsons got a bee in his bonnet whats that about never you mind  ivy have you been running  no why your colours up hope youre not coming down with something  how was your day off daisy lovely thank you  what are you doing with your day off  what i usually do go somewhere on my own  you never give up do you hes not interested  he must be interested in someone hes young isnt he  but that someone is not you  how was mr mason very well as nice as usual  what is it  he wants me to live at the farm  because he wants to leave me the tenancy and all his stock and tools and all his money and everything  my lord youre a proper heiress  i havent said yes yet hes made the offer  a very generous one it is too hes ever so generous  and so kind  this was very good  it was it really was  dont sound so surprised i am surprised  i owe ethel an apology ive underestimated her  i sometimes wonder if i should learn to cook why  it might come in handy one day and ive got to do something  what did you say to that editor who wanted you to write for him i havent said anything yet  its probably too late now  matthew says robert was against it what difference does that make  oh really my dear ssh were all family im not letting the side down  im just saying robert frequently makes decisions based on values that have no relevance any more  do you think i should do it i wouldnt countermand your father  then why bring it up well i do and so does matthew  and so does matthew what what else has matthew decided for my family  robert dont worry i dont need to be fed were going  all of you what are you talking about  do you know who has prepared this luncheon yes ethel our former housemaid  who bore a bastard child wwhat  robert ethel has rebuilt her life  do you know what she has built it into what do you mean  i think cousin robert is referring to ethels work as a prostitute  well of course these days servants are very hard to find  you dont understand the difficulties shes faced i couldnt care less how she earns a living  i care that you have exposed my family to scandal who would know  people find out these things your gardener your kitchen maid  i suppose she has an appropriate costume for every activity  we are leaving  is this because of me my lord no its because of his lordship were not leaving  is that a charlotte russe how delicious  i hope its tasty my lady  mrs patmore gave me some help  im glad to know that mrs patmore has a good heart and does not judge  is anyone coming  seems a pity to miss such a good pudding  who got mrs bartlett to change her evidence whos mrs  durrant now durrant is going to tell her the police are on to her  shell wind up inside if she doesnt change her story to what the truth  or else what i tell the governor you and durrant are bringing in drugs thats a lie  durrant will lose his job and you will stay here five years longer  no he went down there and told them and none of them came away  not even the dowager my my  perhaps the world is becoming a kinder place you say kinder  i say weaker and less disciplined  well if her ladyship is prepared to visit crawley house i dare say you wont object when i do  i wont forbid it because i have no right to do so  but i do object with every fibre of my being  you disappoint me  i never thought of you as a woman with no standards  i wish youd come back to the drawing room  id only set your mothers teeth on edge  shell come through it  she will  which brings me to your performance today  how did that help  i was angry with isobel for exposing you all to gossip  you were angry all right  but not with isobel or ethel  i think its because the world isnt going your way  not any more  has matthew told you about his latest plans for downton  i know he wants to change things doesnt he just  you mustnt let him upset you he more or less told me ive let the estate fall to pieces  im sure he didnt mean that didnt he  a fool and his money are soon parted  i have been parted from my money so i suppose i am a fool  you wont win over the christening  not if youre against me im never against you  but youve lost on this one  did sybil truly not mind  she wanted tom to be happy  she loved him very much you know  we all need to remember that  i keep forgetting shes gone  i see things in the paper that would make her laugh  i come inside to tell her that her favourite rose is in bloom  and then suddenly  say that to mama  please  she doesnt want to hear it from me  hows she doing  shes blooming  they stayed in the house even after they knew  i expect they didnt want to insult mrs crawley  i couldnt have swallowed another bite once i knew  jesus managed to eat with mary magdalene  we cant be sure he ate with her he allowed her to wash his feet i see  well ill tell ethel she has a treat in store  whats the matter with you im sorry but  ivy we havent finished yet  weve never finished  whats this  rouge  have you been painting your face  its not like the old days mrs patmore all the girls do it  not in this house miss hussy go and wash  well see no more of it  its nice to know weve another piano player in the house  unless you think its too soon  oh no lady sybil was a bright young thing  shed be glad of some music you play well james  theres no end to jimmys talents is there  his lordship wants you  i wish he wouldnt do that what  hes always touching me im going to tell mr carson youd never  id tell the flippin police if itd make him stop  i must go i need to fetch some linen  her ladyship wont be long now  what are you doing  nothing it didnt look like nothing  can you dance the foxtrot  i think so yeah i can  would you teach me  well im supposed to lay the tea  and heres me thinking youd like to dance with me  go on then  how do you put the hands like this  that foot goes back first  right yeah it goes slow slow  quick quick slow  slow quick quick slow  slow quick quick  mlady its arrived  its here i wanted you to be the first to know whats arrived  hes done it mr murrays done it  hes got her to make a statement witnessed and everything so when will bates be set free  itll take a few weeks for the formalities but hell be released  mr murrays quite clear about that so mr bates is coming home  oh im so so happy for you i know you are  have you told papa not yet mlady  well do please do hes very low just now  it will be wonderful for him to hear something good  have you seen this note from mama  i have i wonder what she wants  i can stand anything but a lecture on marital harmony  do we have to go i think so we neednt stay long  good  you look very nice this morning  dont flirt with me robert not now  im ever so sorry to interrupt my lord but mrs bartlett has given a statement thatll clear him  at least mr murray says it will make the verdict unsafe  so mr bates is coming back to downton  isnt it marvellous yes that is absolutely marvellous  do you want to telephone murray if you do tell carson  hell manage it for you why are you going out  your grandmother has asked us to call ill hear what he says later  i really am so very glad  excuse me what are you doing here  im sorry mr carson i want to thank mrs patmore  i brought these flowers there are plenty in the gardens here  how nice of you ethel  mrs patmore is in the kitchen  i hope you never need a favour from your fellow man  you can talk as tough as you like i know you wont abandon me  why doesnt that thought make you kinder because i am who i am mrs hughes  slow slow quick quick go back slow  look at the pair of you alfies learning the foxtrot  i bet he is but hes going to have to do better than that  what do you mean hes only learning it to please our ivy  arent you mladdo is that true  well of course it is you runner bean  step aside let me show you how its done  what is going on here  at a time like this of sober dignity  have you lost all sense of shame and propriety sir  what makes you think youre the stuff of a first footman  alfred looks like a first footman to me  take a leaf from his book and learn to conduct yourself with discretion  but mr carson he was the one silence  youre a disgrace to your livery  and as for you daisy  have your years here taught you nothing  thanks for speaking up  i dont suppose you want to practise im very busy  why dont you ask ivy if shes got any spare time  dr clarkson lady grantham how are you  much as youd expect me to be  dr clarkson has something to tell you which may alter your view a little  i dont mean to be discourteous but i doubt it  since youre here i have a few words of my own to say  i feel i owe you an apology please lord grantham  if youll just allow me  on that awful night  im afraid i may have given you the impression that my recommended course of treatment  offered a real chance for lady sybils survival  the truth and ive done a great deal of research since as you can imagine  is that the chance was a small one  a tiny one really id read that early delivery was the only way to avoid the trauma and it is  as you tried so hard to tell us  but what i did not quite realise  was that eclampsia is almost invariably fatal  with or without a caesarian  had you agreed we would have subjected lady sybil to the fear and pain of a hurried operation  when in all likelihood she would have died anyway  but  there was a chance  an infinitesimal one  the discomfort and the terror would have been all too certain  so you think tapsell was right oh i cant go that far  sir philip tapsell ignored all the evidence in a most unhelpful and arrogant manner  but sybil was going to die  when everything is weighed in the balance  i believe that lady sybil was going to die  and now ill take my leave  it seems so strange without sybil shes watching i know  welcome back mr bates he cant have expected to stay my valet  i believe i can make downton safe for our children what about papa  downton has existed for hundreds of years must i remind you of the state the place was in  the editors written back repeating his offer  i assume your father disapproves its the business of parents to worry  i know whats going on what are you going on about hes a ladies man  alfred says hes always going on about you
