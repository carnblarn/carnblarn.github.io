technology inside him could rewrite human science i couldnt show him to anyone  whats the nasty lady done to you hey  no offence but can you two just stop petting for a minute  never mind the tin dog

i missed you oh you didnt need me you were getting on with your life you were my life  you know what the most difficult thing was  coping with what happens next or with what doesnt happen next  you took me to the furthest reaches of the galaxy you showed me  supernovas intergalactic battles and you just dropped me back on earth  how could anything compare to that  all those things you saw you want me to apologise for that no but we get a taste of that splendour  and then we have to go back look at you you were investigating  you found that school you were doing what you always did you

ex ex   extract ana ana   analysing   listen to him man thats a voice  careful thats my dog confirmation of analysis  substance is krillitane oil  theyre krillitanes is that bad  very think how bad things could possibly be and add another suitcase full of bad what are krillitanes  theyre a composite race just like your culture is a mixture of traditions from many countries  people youve invaded or been invaded by  the krillitanes are the same an amalgam of races theyve conquered  but they take physical aspects as well  they cherry pick the best bits from the people they destroy  thats why i didnt recognise them the last time i saw krillitanes  they looked just like us except with really long necks what are they doing here  its the children theyre doing something to the children  so whats the deal with the tin dog  the doctor likes travelling with an entourage  sometimes theyre humans sometimes theyre aliens and sometimes theyre tin dogs what about you  where do you fit in the picture me  im their man in a van im their technical support im    oh my god  im the tin dog  on my command    how many of us have there been travelling with you  does it matter yeah it does if im just the latest in a long line  as opposed to what  i thought you and me were    i obviously got it wrong  ive been to the year 5 billion right but this  now this is really seeing the future you just leave us behind  is that what youre going to do to me no not to you but sarah jane you were  that close to her once and now    you never even mention her  why not i dont age  i regenerate  but humans decay  you wither and you die  imagine watching that happen to someone who you    what doctor  you can spend the rest of your life with me    but i cant spend the rest of mine with you  i have to live on  alone  thats the curse of the time lords  time lord  was that a krillitane  it didnt even touch her just flew off what did it do that for  bell rings  rose and sarah you go to the maths room crack open those computers i need to see the hardware inside  you might need this mickey surveillance i want you outside just stand outside  here take these you can keep k9 company  leave the window open a crack what hes metal i didnt mean for him  what are you going to do  its time i had a word with mr finch  who are you my name is brother lassar and you  the doctor since when did krillitanes have wings  its been our form for nearly  our ancestors invaded bessan  the people there had some rather lovely wings  they made a million widows in one day just imagine  and now your shapes human a personal favourite thats all  and the others my brothers remain in bat form  what you see is a simple morphic illusion  scratch the surface and the true krillitane lies beneath  and what of the time lords  i always thought of you as such a pompous race  ancient dusty senators so frightened of change and    chaos  and of course theyre all but extinct  only you the last  this plan of yours what is it  you dont know thats why im asking  well show me how clever you are  work it out if i dont like it  then it will stop fascinating  your people were peaceful to the point of indolence  you seem to be something new  would you declare war on us doctor  im so old now  i used to have so much mercy  you get one warning  that was it but were not even enemies soon you will embrace us  the next time we meet  you will join with me  i promise you  surveillance you ask me its just another way of saying  sit at the back of the class with the safety scissors and glitter  thatll be me talking to a metal dog then  its not working give it to me  used to work first time in my day  well things were a lot simpler back then  rose can i give you a bit of advice ive got a feeling youre about to  i know how intense a relationship with the doctor can be and i dont want you to feel im intruding    i dont feel threatened by you if thats what you mean good  im not interested in picking up where we left off  no big sad eyes and the robot dog what else were you doing last night  i was just saying how hard it was adjusting to life back on earth  thing is when you two met theyd only just got rid of rationing  no wonder all that space stuff was a bit too much for you  i had no problem with space stuff i saw things you wouldnt believe  try me mummies ive met ghosts robots lots of robots  slitheen in downing street daleks  met the emperor anti matter monsters gas mask zombies  real living dinosaurs real living werewolf  the loch ness monster seriously  listen to us  its like me and my mate shareen the only time we fell out was over a man  and were arguing over the doctor  with you did he do that thing where hed explain something at like 90mph and youd go what  and hed look at you like you just dribbled on your shirt all the time  does he still stroke bits of the tardis yes yes he does  im like do you two want to be alone  hows it going  what listen i need to find out whats programmed inside

school  do you have a lock picking device  we are in a car  maybe a drill attachment  we are in a car  fat lot of good you are  we are in a car  wait a sec were in a car  get back  the skasis paradigm theyre trying to crack the skasis paradigm  the skasis what the god maker  the universal theory crack that equation and youve got control over the building blocks of the universe  time and space and matter yours to control what and the kids are like a giant computer  yes and their learning power is being accelerated by the oil  that oil from the kitchens it works as a conducting agent makes the kids cleverer  that oils on the chips ive eaten them whats 59 x 35  children cant they use adults  no its got to be children the god maker needs imagination to crack it  theyre not just using the childrens brains to break the code  theyre using their souls  let the lesson begin  think of it doctor  with the paradigm solved reality becomes clay in our hands  we can shape the universe and improve it  oh yeah the whole of creation with the face of mr finch  call me old fashioned i like things as they are  you act like such a radical and yet all you want do is preserve the old order  think of the changes that could be made if the power was used for good  what by someone like you no  someone like you  the paradigm gives us power but you could give us wisdom  become a god  at my side  imagine what you could do think of the civilisations you could save  perganon ascinta your own people doctor  standing tall  the time lords reborn  doctor dont listen to him and you could be with him throughout eternity  young fresh  never wither never age never die  their lives are so fleeting so many goodbyes  how lonely you must be doctor  join us  i could save everyone yes  i could stop the war  no the universe has to move forward  pain and loss they define us as much as happiness or love  whether its a world or a relationship  everything has its time  and everything ends  cmon
