charity and abstinence  and it ends like this any statement made by the duke of manhattan  may not be made public without official clearance frau clovis  im so weak sister jatt a little privacy please

chip sees to my physical needs  i hope that means food  but how comes youre still alive after you murdered me that was your own fault  the brain of my mistress survived and her pretty blue eyes were salvaged from the bin  but what about the skin i saw it  you got ripped apart  that piece of skin was taken from the front of my body  this piece is the back  right so youre talking out of your ask not  the mistress was lucky to survive  chip secreted my lady into the hospital  so they dont know youre here chip steals medicine helps my lady  soothes her strokes her  you can stop right there chip but im so alone hidden down here the last human in existence  dont start that theyve called this planet new earth  a vegetable patch and theres millions of humans out there millions of them mutant stock  they evolved cassandra they just evolved like they should  you stayed still you got yourself all pickled and preserved and what good did it do you  i remember that night drinks for the ambassador of thrace   how very kind you are    that was the last time anyone told me i was beautiful  after that it all became such hard work  well youve got a knack for survival ill give you that  but ive not been idle rose tucked away underneath this hospital ive been listening  the sisters are hiding something  what do you mean oh these cats have secrets  hush let me whisper come close  you

the rest of boekind became extinct long ago  hes the only one left  legend says that the face of boe has watched the universe grow old  theres all sorts of superstitions around him  one story says that just before his death  the face of boe will impart his great secret  that he will speak those words only to one like himself  what does that mean its just a story  tell me the rest its said hell talk to a wanderer  to the man without a home  the lonely god  look at me from class to brass  although    ooh  curves  oh baby  its like living inside a bouncy castle the mistress is beautiful  absolument  oh but look  the brain meat expired  my old mistress has gone  but safe and sound in here  but what of the rose childs mind  oh tucked away  i can just about access the surface memory shes

manhattan does not constitute a form of legal contract  winch me up  hup look at me no sign of infection champagne sir  no thanks  you had petrifold regression right had being the operative word past tense completely cured  but thats impossible primitive species would accuse us of magic  but its merely the tender application of science  how on earth did you cure him how on new earth you might say  whats in that solution a simple remedy  then tell me what it is  im sorry  patient confidentiality  i dont believe weve met  my name is matron casp  im the doctor  i think you will find that were the doctors here  matron casp youre needed in intensive care if youd excuse me  its happened again one of the patients is conscious  well we cant have that  this doctor man is dangerous dangerous and clever i might need a mind like his  the sisterhood is up to something  remember that old earth saying never trust a nun  never trust a nurse and never trust a cat  perfume  it was having a perfectly normal bloodwash then all of a sudden it started crying its this one  please  help me look at its eyes so alive  positively sparkling  please where am i  and speech  how can it even have a vocabulary  sister corvin has written a thesis on the migration of sentience she calls it the echo of life  its well worth a read  help me  ive seen enough thank you  if this happens again we might have to review our brainstem policy  and what should we do with the patient  standard procedure  incinerate  screams  ambient temperature is 14 degrees composite a temperature designed to promote healing and wellbeing  there you are come and look at this patient  marconis disease should take years to recover  two days ive never seen anything like it  theyve invented a cellwashing cascade its amazing  their medical science is way advanced  and this one pallidome pancrosis kills you in ten minutes  and hes fine  i need to find a terminal gotta see how they do this  if theyve got the best medicine in the world whys it such a secret  i cant adam and eve it  what    whats with the voice  i dont know just larking about  new earth  new me  well i can talk  new new doctor  mmm arent you just

nurse cat nuns were talking about intensive care but where is it  youre right well done  why would they hide a whole department  its got to be there somewhere search the subframe  what if the subframes locked  try the installation protocol  yeah course sorry hold on  intensive care    certainly looks intensive  thats disgusting  whats wrong with him  im sorry  im so sorry  what disease is that  all of them every single disease in the galaxy theyve been infected with everything  what about us  are we safe the airs sterile just dont touch them  how many patients are there  theyre not patients  but theyre sick  they were born sick theyre meant to be sick  they exist to be sick  lab rats no wonder the sisters have a cure for everything  theyve built the ultimate research laboratory  a human farm  why dont they just die  plague carriers  the last to go its for the greater cause  novice hame  when you took your vows did you agree to this  the sisterhood has sworn to help  what by killing but theyre not real people  theyre specially grown they have no proper existence  whats the turnover  a thousand a day thousand the next  thousand the next how many thousands  for how many years how many  mankind needed us they came to this planet with so many illnesses we couldnt cope  we did try  we tried everything we tried using clonemeat and biocattle the results were too slow  so the sisterhood grew its own flesh  thats all they are flesh  these people are alive  but think of those humans out there  healthy and happy because of us  if they live because of this then life is worthless  but who are you to decide that  im the doctor  and if you dont like it if you want to take it to a higher authority there isnt one  it stops with me  just to confirm none of the humans in the city actually know about this  we thought it best not hold on i can understand the bodies  i can understand your vows but one thing i cant understand  what have you done to rose i dont know what you mean and im being very very calm   you want to beware of that  very very calm  and the only reason im being so very very calm is that the brain is a delicate thing  whatever youve done to roses head i want it reversed we havent done anything  im perfectly fine  these people are dying and rose would care  oh all right cleverclogs    smartypants    ladykiller whats happened to you i knew something was going on in this hospital but i needed this body  and your mind to find it out  who are you the last human  cassandra wake up and smell the perfume  youve hurt him i dont understand  ill

thousand diseases  they pump the patients with a topup every ten minutes youve got about three minutes left  enjoy just let rose go cassandra i will as soon as i find someone younger and    less common then ill junk her with the waste now hushabye  its showtime  anything we can do to help  straight to the point whiskers i want money  the sisterhood is a charity we dont give money we only accept  the humans across the water pay you a fortune and thats exactly what i need  a oneoff payment thats all i want  and perhaps a yacht  in return for which i will tell the city nothing of your institutional murder  is that a deal  im afraid not id really advise you to think about this  theres no need i have to decline  ill tell them and youve no way of stopping me  youre not exactly nuns with guns youre not even armed  who needs arms when we have claws  oh well nice try  chip plan b  what have you done  gave the system a shot of adrenalin just to wake em up  see ya dont touch them

argument  and we will end it  theyre free  by the goddess santori the flesh is free  you caused the pain  oh my god what the hell have you done  it wasnt me one touch and you get every disease in the
