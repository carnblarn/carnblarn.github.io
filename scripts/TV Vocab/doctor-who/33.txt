code  frequent flyers privilege  go on try it  distress signal locking on might be a bit of  turbulence sorry  come on martha lets take a look  automated distress signal transmitting woh now that is hot  automated distress signal transmitting its like a sauna in here  venting systems  working at full pelt trying to cool down  wherever it is we are  well if you cant stand the heat  thats better oi you two  get out of there seal that door now  who are you whatre you doing on my ship are you police  why would we be police we got your distress signal  if this is a ship why cant i hear any engines it went dead four minutes ago  so maybe we should stop chatting and get to engineering captain secure closure active  what this ships gone mad  who activated secure closure i nearly got locked into area 27  who are you hes the doctor and im martha hello  impact projection  well get out of this i promise doctor 42 minutes until what  doctor  look  until we crash into the sun  how many crew members on board seven including us  we transport cargo across the galaxy everythings automated  call the others ill get you out whats he doing doctor dont  aaagh  but my ships in there  in the vent chamber its our lifeboat its lava  the temperatures going mad in there up 3000 degrees in ten seconds and still rising  channelling the air the closer we get to the sun the hotter that roomll get were stuck here  so we fix the engines we steer the ship away from the sun simple  engineering down here is it impact in 4026  blimey dyou always leave things in such a mess oh my god  what happened  its wrecked pretty efficiently too someone knew what they were doing  wheres korwin anyone heard from him or ashton  no dyou mean someone did this on purpose  korwin ashton where are you  korwin can you answer  he should be up here  oh were in the torajii system lovely  youre a long way from home martha half a universe away  yeah feels it and youre still using energy scoops for fusion  hasnt that been outlawed yet  were due to upgrade next docking  scannell engine report  no response what  the controls are wrecked i cant get them back online  oh come on auxiliary engines every crafts got auxiliaries  we dont have access from here the auxiliary controls are in the front of the ship  with 29 passwordsealed doors between us and them well never get there on time  cant you override the doors no sealed closure means what it says theyre all deadlock sealed  so a sonic screwdrivers no use nothings any use weve got no engines no time and no chance  oh listen to you defeated before youve even started  wheres your dunkirk spirit whos got the door passwords  theyre randomly generated reckon id know most of them  sorry riley vashtee whatre you waiting for riley vashtee  its a two person job one to take this for the questions the other to carry this  the oldest and cheapest security system around reliable and simple just like you riley  try to be helpful get abuse nice ill help you make myself useful  its remotely controlled by the computer panel thats why it needs two oi be careful  you too  mcdonnell its ashton  where are you is korwin with you get up to the medcentre now  youve gotta stop it  korwin its abi open your eyes i need to take a look at you  korwin whats happened is he ok kath help me its burning me  how longs he been like this ashton just brought him in what are you doing dont get too close  hes my husband and hes just sabotaged our ship  what he went mad  he locked the ship then sent a heat pulse to melt the controls  he wouldnt do that i saw it happen captain  korwin korwin open your eyes for me a second  i cant yeah course you can go on  dont make me look at you please  all right all right just relax  sedative  whats wrong with him  rising body temperature unusual energy readings  i do love a good stasis chamber keep him sedated in there regulate the body temperature  and run a bioscan a tissue profile and a metabolic detail  just doing them now ooh youre good  anyone else presenting these symptoms not so far thats something  whats the matter with him some sort of infection well get the test results  now back downstairs eh see about those engines go  call us if theres news any questions yeah who are you  im the doctor  heat shield failing at 25  impact in 3250  hurry up will you all right  fix the clamp on whatre you typing  each doors code is the answer to a random question set by the crew  nine tours back we got drunk thought them up  if were hijacked were the only ones who know all the answers  so you type in the right answer this sends an unlock pulse to the clamp  but we only get one chance per door  get it wrong the whole system freezes  better not get it wrong then ok date of ss pentallians first flight thats all right go  yes 28 more to go  abi hows korwin doing any results from the bioscan  hes under heavy sedation im just trying to make sense of this data  give me a couple of minutes and ill let you know  martha riley how you doing area 29 at the door to 28  yeah youve gotta move faster were doing our best  find the next number in the sequence 313 331 367 what  you said the crew knew all the answers  the crews changed since we set the questions  youre joking 379 what  its a sequence of happy primes  happy what just enter it are you sure we only get one chance  any number that reduces to one when you take the sum of the squares of its digits  a happy prime is a number thats both happy and prime  and continue iterating until it yields one is a happy number any number that doesnt isnt  now type it in i dunno talk about dumbing down dont they teach recreational mathematics any more  were through  keep moving fast as you can  and martha be careful there may be something else on board the ship  any time you wanna unnerve me feel free will do thanks  impact in 3050 cant believe our lives depend on some stupid pub quiz is that the next one  ah this is a nightmare  classical music who had the most predownload number ones  elvis presley or the beatles  how are we supposed to know that  we need a backup in case they dont reach the auxiliary engines in time  what have we got doctor  what is
