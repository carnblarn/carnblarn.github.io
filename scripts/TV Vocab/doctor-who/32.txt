then  well you know that your marthas mother and  um no actually thats about it  we havent had much time to chat you know been busy busy          doing what exactly  oh  you knowstuff           ladies and gentlemen           im professor richard           lazarus and tonight     im going to perform a miracle             it is i believe       the most important advance    since rutherford split the atom             the biggest leap    since armstrong stood on the moon                 tonight        you will watch and wonder               but tomorrow        you will wake to a world     which will be changed forever  machine beeps somethings wrong its overloading            somebody stop him    get him away from those controls  if this thing goes up it itll take the whole building with it  get it open           ladies and gentlemen           i am richard lazarus            i am 76 years old             and i am reborn                he did it            he actually did it        that cant be the same guy    its impossible it must be a trick  oh its not a trick  i wish it were         what just happened then  he just changed what it means to be human                excuse me     that was the most astonishing thing             ive ever seen               look at you        this is only the beginning      were not just making history     were shaping the future too      think of the money well make       people will sell their souls      to be transformed like that        and ill be first in line  he gasps          richard im famished  energy deficit always happens with this kind of process        you talk as if you see this        every day mr doctor  and no not every day but i have some experience of this kind of transformation thats not possible  using hypersonic sound waves to create a state of resonance thats inspired     you understand the theory then  you couldnt possibly have allowed for all the variables             no experiment is         entirely without risk  the thing nearly exploded you might as well have stepped into a blender     youre not qualified to comment  if i hadnt stopped it it wouldve exploded       then i thank you doctor but    thats a simple engineering issue     what happened inside the capsule was    exactly what was supposed to happen             no more no less      youve no way of knowing that     until youve run proper tests      look at me see what happened       im all the proof you need        the device will be properly      certified before we start to    operate commercially commercially     you are joking thatll cause chaos                not chaos           change a chance for     humanity to evolve to improve  this isnt about improving this is about you and your customers living a little longer       not a little longer doctor     a lot longer perhaps indefinitely     richard we have things to discuss        upstairs goodbye doctor     in a few years youll look back    and laugh at how wrong you were  ooh hes out of his depth hes no idea the damage he might have done           so what do we do now  now well this building must be full of laboratories i say we do our own tests      lucky ive just collected a dna    sample then isnt it oh oh oh  martha jones youre a star           i grew up over there     tiny flat above a butchers shop      itll have a blue plaque soon       richard lazarus lived here                its gone     destroyed in the war the bombing                of course          1940 do you remember           night after night                explosions                   guns               fire storms          my parents had sent me         to the country by then           when the sirens went     wed go to the cathedral there     people used to shelter in the crypt     the living cowering among the dead     but look what youve built here now        youve laid the foundations             for an empire      an empire we can rule together               whats wrong  he scoffs         look at yourself woman  amazing what  lazaruss dna      i cant see anything different look at it     oh my god did that just change            but it cant have  it did its impossible two impossible things weve seen so far tonight  dont you love it when that happens      that means lazarus has changed       his own molecular patterns  hypersonic sound waves to destabilise the cell structure  then a metagenetic programme to manipulate the coding  he hacked into his own genes and instructed them to rejuvenate      but theyre still mutating now  because he missed something  something in his dnas been activated and wont let him stabilise  somethings trying to change him     change him into what i dont know but i think we need to find out           that woman said they     were going upstairs lets go     its me who made all this possible     this is my triumph and i will not         be denied not by you      not after everything ive done       you backed me because you saw    profit your concern was financial     you want the money as much as i do              we had a plan         when the device is ready        ill be rejuvenated too                 we could     be rich and young and together            you think id waste        another lifetime on you         did that process make you            even more cruel               no my love        that i learned from you          you have a gift for it     then youll know that ill protect     my involvement in the project                 im sure      mr saxon will be interested             whats going on            it must just be                what is it         ill be fine in a moment         its probably just cramp  he gasps                richard        is it some kind of seizure             what should i do     i dont understand whats happening                 richard bones crunch  creature snarls  tish  have you seen martha and that doctor anywhere       not since the demonstration  do you know anything about him has she mentioned him before not to me  the way she followed him    shes a doctor just doing her job         shes not a doctor yet  never will be if she doesnt stay focused     look shes found a bloke so what  theres somethings going on leo  i can feel it              letitia jones        id recognise the smell of     that soap anywhere professor     im sorry ladies and gentlemen     youll have to excuse me while      i take care of letitia here     ive been neglecting her      this is his office all right  so where is he     dont know lets try back at the               reception            is that lady thaw  used to be  its just a shell had all the life energy drained out of her  like squeezing the juice out of an orange lazarus  could be so hes changed already  not necessarily you saw the dna it was fluctuating  the process must demand energy this might not have been enough      so he might do this again mmm        you seem very young to have      such a responsible position        have you much experience                not really     but the interview panel thought    i had all the necessary attributes          how perceptive of them      so where are you taking me up    to the roof its a lovely evening     i thought i would show you the view           its extraordinary           like a lot of things            round here then  bones crunch             i cant see him he cant be far keep looking        hey you all right marth    i think mum wants to talk to you      have you seen lazarus anywhere    well he was getting cosy with tish        a couple of minutes ago          with tish ah doctor  where did they go         upstairs i think why  doctor im speaking to you              not now mum      i think you need one of these  thank you thats very kind of you           do you know that man  no hes a friend of my daughters         perhaps she should choose       her friends more carefully      where are they the fluctuating dnall give off an energy signature  i might be able to pick it up  got him where     but this is the top floor the roof      that clock tower is beautiful          all lit up like that       its southwark cathedral one    of the oldest churches in london     been around even longer than i have           youre looking pretty           good for your age                thank you                 can i                of course         i still cant take it in       im still adjusting myself        ive been working toward it           for so many years           its hard to believe      the moments finally arrived       and is it like you expected        i find that nothings ever        exactly like you expect              theres always       something to surprise you     between the idea and the reality    between the motion and the act  falls the shadow         so the mysterious doctor     knows his eliot im impressed     martha tish get away from him     what dont tell me what to do  you had time for poetry lazarus even being so busy defying the laws of nature youre right doctor       one lifetimes been too short    for me to do everything id like        how much more ill get done        in two or three or four it doesnt work like that  some people live more in 20 years than others do in 80  its not the time that matters its the person       but if its the right person        what a gift that would be or what a curse  look at what youve done to yourself         who are you to judge me     over here tish you have to spoil         everything dont you      every time i find someone nice     you have to try and find fault      hes a monster the age things       a bit freaky but it works        for catherine zeta jones  grinding and gasping  snarling              what is that  run     door bangs     are you ok i was gonna snog him  snarling  siren blares security one security one  security one      whats happening an intrusion     it triggers a security lockdown     kills most of the power stops       the lifts seals the exits  he must be breaking through that door  the stairs come on  snarling door crashes               hes inside we havent got much time  tish is there another way out     theres an exit in the corner    but itll be locked now martha  setting 54 hurry  listen to me  you people are in serious danger you need to get out of here right now          the biggest danger here         is choking on an olive  glass smashes  snarling              mum get back       over here this way everyone      down the stairs now hurry  no get away from her  screaming  squelching  snarling                 lazarus  leave them alone  martha come on stay with me  whats the point you cant control it the mutation is too strong  killing those people wont help you youre a fool  a vain old man who thought he could defy nature  only nature got her own back didnt she  youre a joke lazarus  a footnote in the history of failure  snarling     whats the doctor doing hes trying        to buy us some time leo    focus on me let me see your eyes         hes got concussion mum    youll need to help him downstairs      thisll keep the swelling down       go ill be right behind you                tish move       we need to get out of here           its no good doctor            you cant stop me  is that the same arrogance you had when you swore that nothing had gone wrong with your device        the arrogance is yours you    cant stand in the way of progress  you call feeding on innocent people progress  youre delusional       it is a necessary sacrifice  thats not your decision to make              were trapped    there must be an override switch    wheres the security desk tish                  there                peekaboo  oh hello           ive got to go back  you cant you saw what that thing did itll kill you       i dont care i have to go  its that doctor isnt it  thats whats happened to you thats why youve changed      he was buying us time martha       time for you to get out too          im not leaving him  martha  gas hisses  glass smashes        more hide and seek doctor            how disappointing  gas hisses     why dont you come out and face me have you looked in the mirror lately  why would i want to face that hmm  what are you doing here      thought you might need this             how did you      heard the explosion i blasted lazarus did you kill him  more sort of annoyed him id say           shell be all right            the doctor and her    theyll look out for each other  she turned her back on us  went in there with that thing  for him           he must be some guy           maybe she loves him  she just met him      is your daughter still in there    with the doctor do you know him              hes dangerous     there are things you should know  what things  inaudible whisper                 what now    weve just gone round in a circle  we cant lead him outside come on get in              are we hiding  no he knows were here but this is his masterpiece  im betting he wont destroy it not even to get at us      but were trapped well yeah that is a slight problem     you mean you dont have a plan yes the plan was to get inside here           then what well then id come up with another plan          in your own time then         hey sorry sorry sorry  ah here we are    what are you going to do with that  improvise     creature snarls      i still dont understand where    that thing came from is it alien  no for once its strictly human in origin        human how can it be human  probably from dormant genes in lazaruss dna this reactivated them  now it looks like theyre becoming dominant so its a throwback  some option that evolution rejected millions of years ago but the potential is still there  locked away in your genes forgotten until lazarus unlocked it by mistake        its like pandoras box  exactly nice shoes by the way  machine whirrs         doctor whats happening      hes switched the machine on     thats not good is it i was hoping it would to take him a bit longer     i dont want to hurry you but i know i know nearly done        well what are you doing  setting the capsule to reflect energy rather than receive it           will that kill him  when he transforms hes three times the size spreading himself thin      were going to end up like him just one more       i thought we were going to go        through the blender then  it really shouldnt take that long just to reverse the polarity  i must be a bit out of practice   he seems so      human again           its kind of pitiful  eliot saw that too this is the way the world ends  not with a bang but a whimper     shes here oh shes all right  mrs jones we still havent finished our chat        keep away from my daughter        mum what are you doing  always the mothers every time              hes dangerous         ive been told things        what are you talking about             look around you    nothing but death and destruction          this isnt his fault          he saved us all of us     and it was tish who invited everyone    to this thing in the first place         so id say technically            it was her fault  crash                leave him                  martha               not you too                  sorry  lazarus back from the dead  shouldve known really            wheres he gone  that way  the church cathedral         its southwark cathedral                he told me        do you think hes in here       where would you go if you were looking for sanctuary  he gasps            i came here before              a lifetime ago     i thought i was going to die then        in fact i was sure of it               i sat here               just a child            the sound of planes      and bombs outside the blitz     youve read about it i was there             youre too young  so are you  bones crunch     in the morning the fires had died          but i was still alive          i swore id never face        death like that again             so defenceless      i would arm myself fight back                defeat it  thats what you were trying to do today thats what i did today  what about the other people who died           they were nothing     i changed the course of history  any of them mightve done too you think history is only made with equations  facing death is part of being human  you cant change that no doctor     avoiding death thats being human     its our strongest impulse to cling    to life with every fibre of being       im only doing what everyone       before me has tried to do     ive simply been more successful  he gasps bones crunch  look at yourself youre mutating  youve no control over it you call that a success i call it progress         im more now than i was     more than just an ordinary human  there is no such thing as an ordinary human           hes going to change            again any minute  i know if i could get him up into the bell tower somehow ive an idea that might work up there      youre so sentimental doctor     maybe you are older than you look  im old enough to know that a longer life isnt always a better one  in the end you just get tired  tired of the struggle  tired of losing everyone that matters to you  tired of watching everything turn to dust  if you live long enough lazarus  the only certainty left is that youll end up alone       thats a price worth paying  is it  bones crunch             i will feed soon  im not going to let that happen      youve not been able to stop me       so far leave him lazarus           hes old and bitter         i thought you had a taste      for fresher meat martha no     what are you doing keeping you out     of trouble doctor the tower  he groans            did you hear that    snarling     hes changed again keep moving        weve got to lead him up  where are they  martha     doctor take him to the very top of the bell tower do you hear me              up to the top         martha and then what             martha come on  hypersonic sound waves inspired        theres nowhere else to go     this is where he said to bring him    so then were not trapped were     bait he knows what hes doing       we have to trust him ladies              stay behind me     if he takes me make a run for it     head back down the
