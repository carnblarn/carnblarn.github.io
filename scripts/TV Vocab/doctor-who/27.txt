all right till this morning and then i dont know  i woke up and i felt all dizzy again  it was worse than when i came in  pulse is slightly thready  well lets see what britains finest might suggest  any ideas morgenstern   er dizziness could be a sign of earlyonset diabetes  hardly early onset if youll forgive me miss finnegan any more ideas  swales   erm could recommend a ct scan  and spend all our money  jones   we could take bloods and check for menieres disease  or we could just ask the patient  what did you have for dinner last night   i had salad and the night before  salad again  and salad every night for the past week contrary to my instructions  salt deficiency thats all simple honest salt  hippocrates himself expounded on the virtues of salt  recommended the inhalation of steam from sea water  though no doubt if hed been afflicted with my students  his oaths might have been rather more colourful  now then mr smith good morning to you how are you today   oh not so bad still a bit yknow bleuch  john smith admitted yesterday with severe abdominal pains jones   why dont you see what you can find  amaze me  well it wasnt very clever running round outside was it  sorry   on

you got a brother   no not any more just me  as time passes and i grow ever more infirm and weary miss jones   sorry  right  heart beats  heart beats  i weep for future generations  are you having trouble locating the heart   erm i dont know  stomach cramps  that is a symptom not a diagnosis  and you rather failed basic techniques by not consulting first with the patients chart  that happened to me this morning i had the same thing  and me in the lift well its only to be expected  theres a thunderstorm moving in and lightning  is a form of static electricity as was first proven by  anyone  benjamin franklin  correct  my mate ben  that was a day i got rope burns off that kite and i got soaked  quite and then i got electrocuted   moving on i think perhaps a visit from psychiatric  and next we have mr  no listen ive worked out a plan  we tell annalise that the buffet tonight is 100 carbohydrate  and she wont turn up   take this seriously thats our inheritance shes spending on fake tan   im not far away lets meet up  we can draw up a battle plan  in this weather  im not going out its pouring its not raining here  god thats weird  its raining right on top of you i can see it but

get there at the same time to do that birthday stuff  we tell mum to get there for about 830 9  then that gives me time to have a word with annalise and what   the rain its only rain  martha have you

like interplanetary thugs  and they brought us to the moon  neutral territory  according to galactic law theyve got no jurisdiction over the earth  that rain and lightning  that was them using an h2o scoop  what are you on about galactic law  where dyou get that from   human if theyre police are we under arrest   are we trespassing on the moon  no but i like that  good thinking  no wish it were that simple theyre making a catalogue  that means theyre after something nonhuman which is bad news for me why   oh youre kidding me  dont be ridiculous  stop looking at me like that come on then  troop five floor one  troop six floor two   identify humans and find the transgressor  find it   prepare to be catalogued  do what they say  all they do is shine this light thing  theyre not going to hurt us listen to them  witness the crime  charge physical assault  plea guilty sentence execution  you didnt have to do that  justice is swift  theyve reached the third floor  whats that thing  sonic screwdriver  well if you wont answer properly  no really it is  its a screwdriver and its sonic look  what else have you got  a laser spanner   no it was stolen by emily pankhurst cheeky woman  whats wrong with this computer     judoon must have locked it down  judoon platoon upon the moon  i was just travelling past i swear i wasnt looking for trouble  i noticed these plasma coils around the hospital  its been building up for two days now  so i thought something was going on inside  turns out it was the judoon up above  what are they looking for  something that looks human but isnt  like you apparently like me  but not me havent they got a photo  might be a shapechanger  whatever it is cant you just leave the judoon to find it   if they find the hospital guilty of harbouring a fugitive theyll execute it  all of us  oh yes but if i can find this thing first  oh  see    theyre thick  judoon are thick  so thick theyve wiped the records   oh thats clever what are we looking for  dont know  say any patient admitted with unusual symptoms maybe theres a backup  just keep working ill go and ask mr stoker he might know  mr stoker   kill her   ive restored the backup i found her  you did what   run   when i say now press the button  but i dont know which one  then find out   now   what did you do   increased the radiation by 5 000 killed him dead  but isnt that gonna kill you  nah its only rontgen radiation  we used to play with rontgen bricks  its safe for you to come out ive absorbed it all  all i need to do is expel it  if i concentrate  shift the radiation out of my body and into one spot   say my left shoe  here we go here we go easy does it   out out out out  out out out ow ah itches itches itches itches   done  youre completely mad  youre right i look daft with one shoe  barefoot on the moon   what is that thing   wheres it from the planet zovirax  just a slab  theyre called slabs  basic slave drones you see solid leather all the way through  someone has got one hell of a fetish  but it was that woman miss finnegan  it was working for her just like a servant  my sonic screwdriver  she was a patient burnt out my sonic screwdriver   she had this straw like some sort of vampire  i love my sonic screwdriver  doctor   sorry  you called me doctor anyway   miss finnegan is the alien  she was drinking mr stokers blood  funny time to take a snack youd think shed be hiding  unless no   yes  thats it  wait a minute  yes  internal shapechanger   she wasnt drinking blood she was assimilating it  prepare to be catalogued   human  if she can assimilate mr stokers blood mimic the biology shell register as human   weve got to find her and show the judoon come on   human  thats the thing about slabs  they always travel in pairs  what about you  what about me what   well havent you got backup  you must have a partner or something  humans  were on the moon with judoon and a bloodsucking criminal and you ask personal questions     i like that  humans   im still not convinced youre an alien  nonhuman   oh my god you really are  and again  theyve done this floor  come on  the judoon are logical and just a little bit thick  they wont check a floor theyve checked already if were lucky  how much oxygen is there   not enough for all these people  were gonna run out how you feeling  you all right   running on adrenaline  welcome to my world what about the judoon   big lung reserves wont slow them down wheres mr stokers office   its this way  shes gone   she was here  drained him dry  every last drop i was right shes a plasmavore  then whats she doing on earth   hiding on the run  like ronald biggs in rio de janeiro  whats she doing now  shes still not safe  the judoon could execute us all come on wait a minute  think think think if i was a wanted plasmavore surrounded by police what would i do   ohh  shes as clever as me  almost  find the nonhuman  execute   stay here youve got to hold them up  how do i do that  just forgive me  it could save a thousand lives it means nothing honestly  that was nothing   have you seen    there are these things these great big space rhino things  i mean rhinos from space    and were on the moon   great big space rhinos with guns on the moon   i only came in for my bunions  look  all fixed now good treatment the nurses were lovely  id recommend this place to anyone but then we end up on the moon   did i mention the rhinos    hold him  find the nonhuman  execute   now listen i know who youre looking for  shes this woman she calls herself florence  human wait  nonhuman trace suspected   nonhuman element confirmed   authorise full scan   what are you  what are you   um that big erm machine thing  is it supposed to be making that noise   you wouldnt understand but isnt that a magnetic resonance imaging thing   like a ginormous sort of a magnet  i did magnetics gcse  well i failed but all the same  a magnet with its setting now increased to 50000 tesla  ooh thats a bit strong isnt it   itll send out a magnetic pulse thatll fry the brain stems  of every living thing within 250 000 miles  except for me safe in this room  but hold on hold on i did geography gcse i passed that one  doesnt that distance include the earth  only the side facing the moon  the other half will survive call it my gift  sorry im a little bit out of my depth  ive spent 15 years working as a postman hence the bunion why would you do that   with everyone dead the judoon ships will be mine to make my escape  thats weird you talk like youre some sort of an alien  quite so  no   oh yes youre joshing me  i am not im talking to an alien   in hospital   has it got an et department  its a perfect hiding place  blood banks downstairs for a midnight feast  and all this equipment ready to arm myself with should the police come looking  so those rhinos are looking for you   yes but im hidden  oh right  maybe thats why theyre increasing their scans what   big chief rhino boy he said no sign of a nonhuman we must increase our scans up to setting two   i must assimilate again  what does that mean  i must appear to be human  youre welcome to come home and meet the wife shed be honoured  we can have cake  why should i have cake   ive got my little straw  thats nice milkshake  i like banana  youre quite the funny man  and yet i think laughing on purpose  at the darkness  i think its time you found some peace steady him   what are you doing   im afraid this is going to hurt  but if its any consolation the dead dont tend to remember  confirm human  traces of facial contact with nonhuman  continue the search   you will need this whats that for   compensation  now see what youve done  this poor man just died of fright  scan him   confirmation deceased  no he cant be let me through let me see him  stop case closed but it was her   she killed him she did it she murdered him  judoon have no authority over human crime  but shes not human  oh but i am ive been catalogued  but shes not she assim  wait a minute  you drank his blood  the doctors blood   oh i dont mind scan all you like nonhuman   what  confirm analysis  oh but thats a mistake surely  im human im as human as they come  he gave his life so theyd find you  confirm plasmavore   charged with the crime of murdering the child princess of padrivole regency nine  well she deserved it   those pink cheeks and those blonde curls and that simpering voice  she was begging for the bite of a plasmavore   then you confess  confess  im proud of it   slab stop them   verdict guilty sentence execution   enjoy your victory judoon cos youre going to burn with me   burn in hell   case closed  but what did she mean burn with me   the scanner shouldnt do that shes done something  scans detect lethal acceleration of monomagnetic pulse  well do something stop it   our jurisdiction has ended  judoon will evacuate  you cant just leave it  whats it gonna do   all units withdraw   what about the air
