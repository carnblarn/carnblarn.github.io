units been watching the rattigan academy for ages  its all a bit hitler youth   exercise at dawn and classes and special diets  turn left  ross one question if unit think that atmos is dodgy  how come its in the jeeps yeah  tell me about it its standard in all government vehicles  we cant get rid of them till we can prove something  turn right drives me round the bend  oh nice one  i timed that perfectly yeah  yeah you did  this is your final destination  is it pe i wouldnt mind a kick around  ive got my daps on  suppose youre the doctor hello  your commanding officer phoned ahead  ah but i havent got a commanding officer have you  oh this is ross say hello ross afternoon sir  lets have a look then i can smell genius in a good way  oh now  thats clever look  single molecule fabric  how thin is that  you could pack a tent in a thimble  ooh gravity simulators  terraforming biospheres nano tech steel construction  this is brilliant do you know with equipment like this you could ooh i dont know  move to another planet or something  if only that was possible  if only that were possible  conditional clause i think youd better come with me  youre smarter than the usual unit grunts all right  he called you a grunt dont call ross a grunt hes nice  we like ross look at this what exactly do you want  i was just thinking what a responsible 18yearold  inventing zerocarbon cars  saving the world  takes a man with vision  but atmos means more people driving more cars more petrol   the oil will run out faster the atmos system could make it worse  see thats tautology  you cant say atmos system   it stands for atmospheric omission system  so youre saying atmospheric omission system system  see mr conditional clause  its been a long time since anyone said no to you hasnt it  im still right though  not easy is it being clever  you look at the world and you connect things random things  you think why cant anyone else see it  the rest of the world is so slow  yeah youre all on your own  i know  but not with this theres no way you invented this singlehanded  earth technology but like finding a mobile phone in the middle ages no ill tell you what its like   its like finding this in someones front room  albeit a very big front room what is it  yeah just looks like a thing people dont question things  they think just a thing leave it alone  i make these connections and this looks like a teleport pod  oh orbit now holding at 5563 sector 270  we have an intruder  how did he get in intruder window  byebye  ross get out luke come with me  sontaran  thats your name isnt it  youre a sontaran how did i know that eh  fascinating isnt it isnt that worth keeping me alive  i order you to surrender in the name of unit thats not gonna work  cordolaine signal am i right copper excitation  stops the bullets  how do you know so much well  who is he he didnt give his name  this isnt typical sontaran behaviour is it  hiding using teenagers stopping bullets  you dishonour me sir yeah then show yourself  i will look into my enemys eyes  oh my god and your name  general staal of the 10th sontaran fleet staal the undefeated  what if you do get defeated  not quite so undefeated any more but never mind  hes like a potato a baked potato a talking baked potato  now ross dont be rude you look like a pink weasel to him  the sontarans are the finest soldiers in the galaxy  dedicated to a life of warfare  a clone race grown in batches of millions  only one weakness  sontarans have no weakness  a good weakness arent you meant to be clever  only an idiot would provoke him  theyre fed by a probic vent in the back of their neck   thats their weak spot   so they have to face their enemies in battle  brilliant  they can never turn their back  we stare into the face of death  yeah well stare at this  what have you done  dont touch me  a sontaran would rather be court martialled than show pain  i must return but he broke the teleport  pah primitive sonic trickery  the device is now repaired  our presence is known  soldiers we move to a war footing  i see you face battle open skinned sir might i share that honour  you may  thank you  howdo you tell each other apart we say the same of humans  tell me boy how many atmos devices have been installed  theyve gone worldwide but only about half  which means 400 million cars converted  a fine arsenal  sufficient for conversion  more than enough yeah and that test signal proved that it works  man that is so cool  is the temperature significant  no thats just a phrase  ill get my people ready general just tell me where and when  have we infiltrated unit the process is about to begin  then youll see it completed commander skorr get to it  yes sir  is someone gonna tell me what the hell is going on  ok  so listen youre not the first aliens ive met just tell me who you are  commander skorr of the 10th sontaran battle fleet  known as skorr the bloodbringer what have you done to those two  simple hypnotic control as with the factory drones  but with you we need something more complex  whatis that  soon that will be you  atmos devices operating at 100 efficiency  continue  war can never come too soon  take your last look boy  it was never big enough for me  i like your ambition  that doctor he was in a unit jeep  it should have atmos installed  you said you didnt know his name  i dont he just said doctor does that mean something  there is an enemy of the sontarans known as the doctor  a face changer  do you mean hes an alien too  legend says he led the battle in the last great time war  the finest war in history and we werent allowed to be part of it  the last of the time lords will die at the hands of the sontaran empire  in the ruins of his precious earth  it is inadvisable to struggle  the female has a weak thorax  but what are you doing completing mental transfer  the clone needs full memory access clone  you cant  thats not you will sleep girl  sleep and keep the memories alive  memories we can use  in battle  we have the doctors vehicle  an ordinary death for such a remarkable enemy but proceed  greyhound 40 to trap one repeat can you hear me over  whys it not working must be the sontarans  if they can trace that they can isolate the atmos turn left  try going right it said left i know so go right  ive got no control its driving itself  it wont stop the doors are locked  ah its deadlocked i cant stop it let me  the satnavs just a box wired through the whole car  is he going in the water i love it with the water  were heading for the river  atmos are
