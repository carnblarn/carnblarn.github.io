satellite five because my sister cant afford university  and the payscheme is really good    liar  lets look at the facts shall we  hidden behind a genetic graft but thats still you  eva saint julienne last surviving member of the freedom fifteen  mmm selfdeclared anarchist is that right  who controls satellite five  theres the truth  the freedom foundation has been monitoring satellite fives transmissions  we have absolute proof that the facts are being manipulated  you are lying to the people  oooh i love it say it again  this whole system is corrupt  who do you represent  im merely a humble slave  i answer to the editor in chief  who is he where is he hes overseeing everything  literally everything  if you dont mind im gonna have to refer this upwards  grrr  what is that your boss  this has always been your boss  since the day you were born  give me access  give me    i can learn anything  lets try erm computers  from the 21st century to the present day give me the history of the microprocessor  oh my god  they only give us twenty minutes maintenance cant you give it a rest  but youve never been to another floor not even one floor down  i went to floor 16 when i first arrived thats medical thats where i got my head done  and then i  i came straight here  satellite five you work eat and sleep on the same floor thats it  youre not management are you  at last shes clever  whatever it is dont involve me i dont know anything  dont you even ask why would i youre a journalist  whys all the crew human  whats that got to do with anything  theres no aliens on board why  i dunno no real reason  theyre not banned then where are they  immigrations tightened up   its had to with all the threats  what threats  i dunno all of them usual stuff  the price of spacewarp doubled so that kept the visitors away  oh and the government on chavic fice collapsed so that lot stopped coming ysee  lots of little reasons thats all  adding up to one great big fact and you didnt even notice  doctor i think if there was any sort of conspiracy satellite five would have seen it  we see everything i can see better  this societys the wrong shape even the technology its cutting edge  theres a door in your head  shouldve chucked this out years ago whats going on  its not just this space station its the way people think  the great and bountiful human empire somethings holding it back  and how would you know  humanitys been set back about 90 years  when did satellite five start broadcasting   mum dad keep this message ok  whatever you do dont erase it  save  it you got that  the microprocessor became redundant in the year 2019  replaced by a system called smt  thats single molecule transcription  no no no no no what are you doing  come back come   why are you doing that  whats floor 16 whats down there  sorry erm    floor 16 thats erm   what do you cover  medical nonemergency  right wrong floor im having technical difficulties my screen keeps freezing locking me out  no thats medical there must be something wrong with your chip  yes yeah of course yeah  i havent got one  no wonder you cant get a screen to work  what are you a  student  yes yeah im erm    im on a research project    from the university of mars  the martian boondocks typical yep  well you still need chipping  so does that mean like    brain surgery thats an oldfashioned phrase but its the same thing yes  oh ok never mind  but if i get a chip  that means i could use any computer  absolutely  youll have to pay for it  theyve stopped subsidising  oh right sorry wasting your time  thanks  hold on  can i use this  thatll do nicely  it all comes down to two basic types  type one the headchip inserted into the back of the skull one hundred credits  theres the chip  tiny invisible no scarring  type two is the full infospike  oh erm thats the     thing thats the one  it does cost 10 000  oh well i erm i couldnt afford it then  not at all turns out youve got unlimited credit  no but i  well i couldnt have it done  i mean  thats gotta hurt hasnt it  painless contractual guarantee  no my  my mates waiting upstairs i cant have major surgery  it takes ten minutes  that sort of money buys a very fast picosurgeon  no but i    i couldnt though no  type one you can interface with a simple computer  type two you are the computer  you can transmit any piece of information from the archive of satellite five  which is just about the entire history of the human race  now     which ones it going to be  were so gonna get in trouble  youre not allowed to touch the mainframe well get told off  rose tell her to button it you cant vandalise the place someones gonna notice  i dont understand  we did a full security scan that man was there when we found suki macrae cantrell  there were no indications about him  and yet here he is  clearly acting outside the parameters  fascinating  grrr  yes sir  absolutely  at once  check him  double check him triple check him quadruple  this is nothing to do with me im going back to work  go on then see ya i cant just leave you can i  if you want to be useful get them to turn the heating down its boiling  cant they do something about it  we keep asking something to do with the turbines  something to do with the turbines i dont know exactly i give up on you cathica  now rose look at rose  rose is asking the right kind of questions  i thank you  why is it so hot  one minute you worry about the empire the next its the central heating  oh never underestimate plumbing plumbing is very important  security scan complete  well who is he he is noone  what does that mean  he is noone  what you mean he has a fake id  he has no identification  but everyones registered we have a census for the entire empire  he is noone  what he doesnt exist  not anywhere he is noone  what about the blonde  she is noone both of them  well we all know what happens to nonentities  they get promoted  bring them up  here we go satellite five pipes and plumbing look at the layout  this is ridiculous  youve got access to the computers core  you could look at the archive the news the stock exchange    and youre looking at pipes but theres something wrong  i suppose   why what is it  the ventilation system  cooling ducts ice filters all working flat out  channelling massive amounts of heat down  all the way from the top floor 500  something up there is generating tons and tons of heat  dont know about you but i feel im missing out on a party  its all going on upstairs  fancy a trip you cant you need a key  keys are just codes and ive got the codes right here here we go  override 2159  how come its giving you the code  someone up there likes me  i told you it was painless  no scarring you see  perfect success  how do i  activate it  its a personal choice  some people whistle  i know one man who triggers it with oh danny boy  but youre set on default for now  thats a click of the fingers  you mean i just     click  come on come with us no way  bye well dont mention my name  when you get in trouble just dont involve me  thats her gone adams given up looks like its just you and me  yeah good  yep  oh my god im gonna be sick  he retches  special offer  we installed the vomitomatic at the same time  nanotermites have been placed in the lining of your throat  in the event of sickness    they freeze the waste  the walls are not made of gold  you should go back downstairs  tough  i started without you  this is fascinating  satellite five contains every piece of information within the fourth great and bountiful human empire  birth certificates shopping habits bank statements but you two    you dont exist  theres not a trace  no birth no job not the slightest kiss  how can you walk through the world and not leave a single footprint  suki  suki  hello  can you hear me suki  what have you done to her i think shes dead  but shes  working  theyve all got chips in their head and the chips keep going like puppets  oh youre full of information but its only fair we get some information back  because apparently youre noone  its so rare not to know something  who are you  it doesnt matter cos were off nice to meet you  come on  tell me who you are since that informations keeping us alive im hardly gonna say  well perhaps my editor in chief can convince you otherwise  and whos that  it may interest you to know that this is not the fourth great and bountiful human empire  in fact its not actually human at all  its merely a place where humans happen to live grrr  yep yep  sorry  its a place where humans are allowed to live by kind permission of my client  grrr  what is that  you mean that things in charge of satellite five  that thing as you put it is in charge of the human race  for almost 100 years mankind has been shaped and guided  his knowledge and ambition strictly controlled by its broadcast news  edited by my superior your master  and humanitys guiding light  the mighty jagrafess of the holy hadrojassic maxarodenfoe  i call him max  create a climate of fear and its easy to keep the borders closed  its just a matter of emphasis  the right word in the right broadcast repeated often enough can destabilise an economy  invent an enemy change a vote  so all the people on earth are like  slaves  well now theres an interesting point  is a slave a slave if he doesnt know hes enslaved yes  oh i was hoping for a philosophical debate is that all im gonna get  yes yes  youre no fun  let me out of these manacles youll find out how much fun i am  oh hes tough isnt he   but come on isnt it a great system  youve got to admire it just a bit  you cant hide something on this scale somebody mustve noticed  from time to time someone yes  but the computerchip system allows me to see inside their brains  i can see the smallest doubt and crush it  and then they just carry on living the life strutting about downstairs  and all over the surface of the earth like theyre so individual  when of course theyre not theyre just cattle  in that respect the jagrafess hasnt changed a thing  but what about you youre not a jagra  er  belly  jagrafess jagrafess youre not a jagrafess  youre human yeah well simply being human doesnt pay very well  but you couldnt have done this all on your own no  i represent a consortium of banks  money prefers a longterm investment  also the jagrafess needed a little hand to erm install himself  no wonder creature that size whats its lifespan  thats one hell of a metabolism generating all that heat  thats why satellite fives so hot  you pump it out of the creature channel it downstairs jagrafess stays cool stays alive  satellite five is one great big lifesupport system  he dials  me again dont wipe this message  its just gonna sound like white noise but save it cos i can translate it ok  three two one and spike  but thats why youre so dangerous  knowledge is power but you remain unknown  electrical surge who are you  leave her alone im the doctor  shes rose tyler were nothing were just wandering  tell me who you are ive just said  yeah but who do you work for  who sent you who knows about us  who exactly     time lord  what  oh yes the last of

hands on it ill die first  well die all you like i dont need ya ive got the key  you and your boyfriends  today we are the headlines  we can rewrite history  we could prevent mankind from developing  and noones gonna stop you  because youve bred a human race which doesnt bother to ask questions  stupid little slaves believing every lie  theyll just trot right into the slaughterhouse if theyre told its made of gold  grrr  disengage safety  alarm sounds  whats happening  maximum access override floor 139  and  spike  someones disengaged the safety  whos that  its cathica and shes thinking  shes using what she knows  terminate her access  everything i told her about satellite five the pipes the filters shes reversing it  look at that its getting hot  i said terminate  burn out her mind  oh no you dont  you shouldve promoted me years back  shes venting the heat up here  the jagrafess needs to stay cool and now its sitting on top of a volcano  grrr  oh um yes im trying sir but i dont know how she did it its impossible  a member of staff with an idea  what do i do  flick the switch  alarm sounds  oi mate you want to bank on a certainty  massive heat in a massive body    massive bang
