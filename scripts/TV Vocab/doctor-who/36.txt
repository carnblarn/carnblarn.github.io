same what is this who is he  an easter egg  excuse me  like a dvd extra yeah  you know how on dvds they put extras on documentaries and stuff  sometimes they put on hidden ones and they call them easter eggs  you have to look for them follow clues in the menu screen  doctor on tv complicated  larry sorry  its interesting actually  he is on 17 different dvds  there are 17 totally unrelated dvds all with him on  always hidden away always a secret  not even the publishers know how he got there  ive talked to the manufacturers right they dont even know  its like hes a ghost dvd extra  just shows up where hes not supposed to be but only on those those 17  well what does he do  just sits there making random remarks  its like were hearing half a conversation  me and the guys are always trying to work out the other half  when you say you and the guys you mean the internet dont you  how do you know spooky isnt it  very complicated  man at counter florence need you  scuse me a sec  people assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect  but actually from a nonlinear nonsubjective viewpoint  its more like a big ball of wibblywobbly timeywimey stuff  started well that

to death  the rest of your life used up and blown away in the blink of an eye  you die in the past and in the present they consume the energy of all the days you might have had  all your stolen moments theyre creatures of the abstract they live off potential energy  what in gods name are you talking about  trust me just nod when he stops for breath  tracked you down with this this is my timeywimey detector  it goes ding when theres stuff  also it can boil an egg at 30 paces  whether you want it to or not so ive learned to stay away from hens  its not pretty when they blow  i dont

universe whered you get that  theres a man in 1969 he sent me with a message for you  what man the doctor  and what was the message just this  look at the list  what does that mean is that it look at the list  he said youd have it by now  a list of 17 dvds  i didnt stay a policeman back then  got into publishing  then video publishing  then dvds of course  you put the easter egg on  have you noticed what all 17 dvds have in common yet  i suppose its hard for you in a way  how could the doctor have even known i had a list i only just got this  i asked him how but he said he couldnt tell me  he said youd understand it one day  but that i never would  soon as i understand it ill come and tell you  no gorgeous girl you cant  theres only tonight  he told me all those years ago that wed only

doesnt matter  ok  there he is  the doctor  whos the doctor  hes the doctor yep thats me  ok that was scary  no it sounds like hes replying but he always says that  doctor yes i do  larry and that doctor yep and this  he can hear us oh my god you can really hear us  of course he cant hear us look  ive got a transcript see everything he says  yep thats me yes i do yep and this next its  both are

support him  martha sorry  ive seen this bit before  doctor quite possibly   fraid so  but youre replying to me  you cant know exactly what ill say  38 im getting this down  im writing in your bits how how is this possible  tell me not so fast  people dont understand time  its not what you think it is then what is it  complicated tell me  very complicated  im clever and im listening  and dont patronise me because people have died and im not happy  tell me  people assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect  but actually from a nonlinear nonsubjective viewpoint  its more like a big ball of wibblywobbly timeywimey stuff  yeah ive seen this bit before you said that sentence got away from you  it got away from me yeah  next thing youre going to say is well i can hear you  well i can hear you this isnt possible no  its brilliant  not hear you exactly but i know everything youll to say  always gives me the shivers that bit  how can you know what im going to say  look to your left what does he mean by look to your left  larry ive written tons about that on the forums i think its a political statement  he means you what are you doing  writing in your bits  so ive got a complete transcript of the whole conversation  wait till this hits the net this will explode the egg forums  doctor ive got a copy of the finished transcript its on my autocue  how can you have a copy of the finished transcript it is still being written  i told you im a time traveller i got it in the future  ok let me get my head round this  youre reading from a transcript of a conversation youre still having  wibblywobbly timeywimey  actually never mind that  you can do shorthand  so  what matters is we can communicate  we have got big problems now  theyve taken the blue box havent they  the angels have the phone box  the angels have the phone box  thats my favourite i have it on a tshirt  what do you mean angels  you mean those statue things  creatures from another world theyre just statues only when you see them  what does that mean lonely assassins they were called  noone knows where they came from theyre as old as the universe or nearly  theyve survived this long as they have the most perfect defence system ever evolved  they are quantumlocked they dont exist when being observed  the moment theyre seen by any living creature they freeze into rock  its a fact of their biology  in the sight of any living thing they literally turn to stone  and you cant kill a stone  course a stone cant kill you either  but then you turn your head away then you blink and oh yes it can  dont take your eyes off that  thats why they cover their eyes theyre not weeping they cant risk looking at each other  their greatest asset is their greatest curse  they can never be seen  the loneliest creatures in the universe  and im sorry i am very very sorry its up to you now  what am i supposed to do the blue box my time machine  there is a world of time energy in there they could feast on forever  the damage they can do can switch off the sun  you have got to send it back to me  how how  and thats it im afraid  theres no more from you on the transcript thats all ive got  i dunno what stopped you talking but i can guess theyre coming  the angels are coming for you  listen your life could depend on this dont blink dont even blink blink and youre dead  theyre fast faster than you can believe dont turn your back dont look away and dont blink  good luck  no dont you cant  ill rewind him what good would that do  youre not looking at the statue  neither are you  keep looking at it keep looking at it  larry theres just one right theres just this one  were ok if we keep staring at this one statue everything will be fine  theres three more three  they were upstairs i think i heard them moving  where three moving where  ill look around im going to check keep looking at this one dont blink  remember what he said dont even blink  who blinks im too scared to blink  ok
