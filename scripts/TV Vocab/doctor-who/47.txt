the last message  thats confidential i trust this man  with my life with everything  youve only just met him no hes only just met me erm  this might be important actually  in a moment  this is a data extract that came with the message   people who were in the library when the planet was sealed  but how can 4022 people have been saved if there were no survivors  thats what were here to find out  and so far what we havent found are any bodies  she screams  everybody careful stay in the light  so you keep saying i dont see the point who screamed  miss evangelista where is she  miss evangelista
