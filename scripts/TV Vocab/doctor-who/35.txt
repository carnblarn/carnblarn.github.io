when the doctor became human  he took the alien part of himself and stored it inside the watch  its not a watch it just looks like a watch  and alien means  not from abroad i take it  the man you call john smith  he was born on another world  a different species yeah  then tell me in this fairy tale who are you  just a friend im not  i mean you havent got a rival as much as i might  just his friend

at the school shes lucy cartwright  or shes taken lucy cartwrights form  if she came home this afternoon and if the parents  how easily i accept these ideas  i must go to them before anyone else dies  you cant martha there must be something we can do  not without the watch youre this doctors companion cant you help  what exactly dyou do for him  why does he need you  because hes lonely  and thats what you want me to become  knock on door what if its them  im not an expert but i dont think scarecrows knock  i brought you this  hold it i wont  please just hold it  it told me to find you it wants to be held  youve had this watch all this time why didnt you return it  because it was waiting  then because i was so scared  of the doctor why  because ive seen him  hes like fire and ice and rage  hes like the night and the storm and the heart of the sun  stop it hes ancient and forever he burns at the centre of time and he can see the turn of the universe  stop it i said stop it  and hes wonderful  ive still got this  the journal  those are just stories  now we know thats not true perhaps theres something in here  loud explosion what the hell  thisll flush him out thisll do it super super fun  theyre destroying the village  the watch john dont  can you hear it faint voice murmurs  like hes asleep  waiting to waken  why did he speak to me oh low level telepathic field you were born with it  just an extra synaptic engram causing  is that how he talks thats him all you have to do is open it and hes back  you knew this and yet you watched while miss redfern and i i didnt know how to stop you  he gave me a list of things to watch out for but that wasnt included  falling in love that didnt even occur to him  no  then what sort of man is that  and now you expect me to die  it was always gonna end the doctor said the familys got  a limited lifespan thats why they need to consume a time lord  otherwise three months and they die  like mayflies he said  so your job was to execute me  people are dying out there  they need him and i need him  cos youve got no idea what hes like ive only just met him it wasnt even that long ago but  he is everything  hes just everything to me and he doesnt even look at me but i dont care  cos i love him to bits and i hope to god he wont remember me saying this  louder explosion  its getting closer  i should have thought of it before i can give them this  just the watch then they can leave and i can stay as i am  you cant do that if they want the doctor they can have him  hell never let you do it if they get what they want then  then it all ends in destruction  i never read to the end those creatures would live forever  to breed and conquer war across the stars for every child  martha timothy  could you leave us alone please  shells whistle overhead  if i could do this instead of you then i would  but my hopes arent important  he wont love you  if hes not you then i dont want him to  i had one husband and he died  and i never thought ever again  and then you  you were so and it was real i wasnt  i really thought  let me see blasted thing  blasted blasted thing  i cant even hear it says nothing to me  baby cries  laughter  theyre all safe arent they the children  the grandchildren  everyones safe everyones safe  and they all send their love john  well then its done  thank you  did you see  the time lord has such adventures  but he could never have a life like that and yet i could  what are you going to do  well blast them into dust then fuse the dust into glass then shatter them all over again  footsteps  just pinging noises  just stop the bombardment  thats all i ask ill do anything you want just stop  say please  please  wait a minute  still human  i cant pretend to understand not for a second but i want you to know im innocent in all this  he made me john smith its not like i had any control over it  he didnt just make himself human he made himself an idiot  same thing isnt it  i dont care about this doctor and your family i just want you to go  so ive made my choice  you can have him  just take it please take him away at last  dont think thats saved your life  family of mine  now we shall have the lives of a time lord  its empty wheres he gone  you tell me  oh i think the explanation might be youve been fooled by a simple olfactory misdirection  a little bit like ventriloquism of the nose its an elementary trick in certain parts of the galaxy  and its got to be said i dont like the look of that hydrokinometer  it seems to be indicating youve got energy feedback all the way through the retrostabilisers feeding back  into the primary heat converters cos if theres one thing you shouldnt have done  you shouldnt have let me press all those buttons  but in fairness i will give you one word of advice  run  get out get out  warning alarms wail  alarms escalate  alarms reach crescendo  he never raised his voice that was the worst thing  the fury of the time lord  and then we discovered why  why this doctor whod fought with gods and demons why hed run away from us and hidden  he was being kind  he screams  he wrapped my father in unbreakable chains forged in the heart of a dwarf star  he tricked my mother into the event horizon of a collapsing galaxy  to be imprisoned there forever  he still visits my sister once a year every year  i wonder if one day he might forgive her but there she is  can you see her he trapped her inside a mirror  every mirror if ever you look at your reflection and see something move behind you just for a second  thats her thats always her  as for me i was suspended in time  and the doctor put me to work standing over the fields of england  as their protector  we wanted to live forever  so the doctor made sure that we did  is it done  its done  the police and the army are at school  parents have come to take the boys home  i should go theyll have so many questions  im not sure what to say  oh  you look the same  goodness you must forgive my rudeness  john smith hes in here somewhere  like a story  could you change back yes  will you  no  i see  well then  he was braver than you in the end  that ordinary man  you chose to change  he chose to die  come with me im sorry  travel with me  as what my companion  oh but thats not fair  what must i look like to you doctor  i must seem so very small  no we could start again id like that  you and me we could try at least  cos everything that john smith is and was  i cant  please come with me i cant why not  john smith is dead  and you look like him  but hes here  inside  if you look in my eyes  answer me this just one question thats all  if the doctor had never visited us if  hed never chosen this place  on a whim  would anyone here have died  you can go  right then molto bene  how was she  time we moved on  if you want i could go and  time we moved on  um meant to say  back there last night i wouldve said anything to get you to change  yeah course you would i wasnt really  no no no good fine  so there we are then there we are then yes  and i never said  thanks for looking after me  doctor martha  tim timothy tim  i just wanted to say goodbye  and thank you  because ive seen the future and i now know what must be done  its coming isnt it  the biggest war ever  you dont have to fight i think we do  but you could get hurt  well so could you travelling around with him but its not going to stop you  tim id be honoured if youd take this  i cant hear anything no its just a watch now  but keep it with you for good luck  look after yourself  youll like
