us mad  then he is a stranger to pompeii  soon he will learn  we have found it sister spurrina  in the thirteenth book of the sibylline oracles  the blue box  a temple made of wood  and yet the sibyl foretold that the box would appear at the time of storms  and fire and betrayal  sisters  reverend mother you should sleep  the sibylline oracles are wrong  but we have venerated her words for generations  this is a new age  heed my words  i predict a future of prosperity and might  an endless empire of pompeii  reaching out from this city to topple rome itself  and encompass the whole wide world  if the disciples of the blue box defy this prophecy  their blood will run across the temple floor  the gods approve  positions  there you go  thank you kind sir  im afraid business is closed

good cos  im the marble inspector  by the gods of commerce an inspection  im sorry sir i do apologise for my son  this is my good wife metella   i must confess were not prepared for  nothing to worry about  im sure youve got nothing to hide although frankly that object   looks rather like wood to me  i told you to get rid of it  i only bought it today  ah well caveat emptor  oh youre celtic theres lovely  im sure its fine but i might have to take it off your hands for a proper inspection  while were here would you recommend a holiday spartacus  dont know what you mean spartacus  well this lovely family mother and father and son  dont you think they should get out of town   why should we do that  well the volcano for start   what  the volcano   the whatano  that great big volcano right on your doorstep  oh spartacus for shame we havent even greeted the household gods yet  they dont know what it is vesuvius is just a mountain to them  the top hasnt blown off yet  the romans havent even got a word for volcano  not until tomorrow  oh great they can learn a new word   as they die  donna stop it  listen i dont know what sort of kids youve been flying round with now spaceman  but youre not telling me to shut up  that boy how old is he sixteen   and tomorrow he burns to death  and thats my fault  right now yes  announcing lucius petrus dextrus  chief augur of the city government  lucius my pleasure as always  quintus stand up  a rare and great honour sir for you to come to my house  the birds are flying north and the wind is in the west  quite absolutely  thats good is it   only the grain of wheat knows where it will grow  there now metella   have you ever heard such wisdom  never  its an honour  pardon me sir i have guests  this is spartacus and spartacus  a name is but a cloud upon a summer wind  but the wind is felt most keenly in the dark  but what is the dark   other than an omen of the sun  i concede that every sun must set   and yet the son of the father must also rise  damn  very clever sir  evidently a man of learning  oh yes but dont mind me dont want to disturb the status quo  hes celtic   well be off in a minute  im not going  its ready sir   youve got to  well im not  the moment of revelation  and here it is exactly as youve specified   it pleases you sir  as the rain pleases the soil  oh now thats different who designed that then  my lord lucius was very specific   where did you get the pattern  on the rain and mist and wind   but that looks like a circuit  made of stone  dyou mean you just dreamt that thing up  that is my job as city augur  whats that then like the mayor  oh you must excuse my friend shes from barcelona  but this is an age of superstition of official superstition  the augur is paid by the city to tell the future  the wind will blow from the west thats their equivalent of the ten oclock news  theyre laughing at us  those two they use words like tricksters theyre mocking us  no no no i meant no offence  im sorry my daughters been consuming the vapours  by the gods mother what have you been doing to her   not now quintus  but shes sick just look at her  i gather i have a rival in this household  another with the gift  oh shes been promised to the sibylline sisterhood  they say she has remarkable visions  the prophecies of women are limited and dull  only the menfolk have the capacity for true perception  ill tell you where the winds blowing right now mate  the mountain god marks your words  id be careful if i were you   consuming the vapours you said  they give me strength   it doesnt look like it to me  is that your opinion   as a doctor  i beg your pardon  doctor thats your name   how did you know that  and you  you call yourself noble  now then evelina dont be rude  no no no no let her talk  you both come from so far away  the female soothsayer is inclined to invent all sorts of vagaries   no i reckon youve been outsoothsayed  is that so   man from gallifrey  what  the strangest of images  your home is lost in fire is it not  doctor what are they doing   and you daughter of london  how does he know that  this is the gift of pompeii  every single oracle tells the truth   thats impossible  doctor  she is returning  who is whos she  and you daughter of london  there is something on your back  whats that mean  even the word doctor is false  your real name is hidden  it burns in the stars in the cascade of medusa herself  you are a lord sir  a lord of time  evelina  she didnt mean to be rude  shes ever such a good girl  but when the gods speak through her   whats wrong with her arm  an irritation of the skin  she never complains bless her  we bathe it in olive oil every night  what is it  evelina said youd come from far away  please have you ever seen anything like it  its stone   different sort of hypocaust  oh yes  were very advanced in pompeii  in rome theyre still using the old woodburning furnaces  but weve got hot springs leading from vesuvius itself   who thought of that  the soothsayers  after the great earthquake  an awful lot of damage  but we rebuilt  didnt you think of moving away  no then again san francisco  thats a little restaurant in naples isnt it   whats that noise  dont know  happens all the time  they say the gods of the underworld are stirring  but after the earthquake let me guess   is that when the soothsayers started making sense  oh yes very much so  i mean theyd always been shall we say imprecise  but then the soothsayers the augurs the haruspex all of them  they saw the truth again and again  its quite amazing  they predict crops and rainfall with absolute precision  have they said anything about tomorrow  no  why should they why dyou ask  no no no reason just asking  but the soothsayers they all consume the vapours yeah  thats how they see  ipso facto  look you    theyre all consuming this  dust  tiny particles of rock  theyre breathing in vesuvius  quintus me old son  this lucius petrus dextrus where does he live  its nothing to do with me  let me try again  this lucius petrus dextrus  where does he live  dont tell my dad  only if you dont tell mine  pass me that torch  the liar  he told my father it was the only one  well plenty of marble merchants in this town  tell them all the same thing get all the components from different places  so noone can see what youre building   which is what  the future  doctor we are building the future  as dictated by the gods  youre not supposed to laugh thanks for that  what dyou think  the goddess venus  thats sacrilege  nice to see you laugh though  what dyou do in old pompeii then girls of your age  you got mates dyou go hanging about round the shops  tk maximus  i am promised to the sisterhood  for the rest of my life   dyou get any choice in that  its not my decision  the sisters chose for me i have the gift of sight  then   what can you see happening tomorrow  is tomorrow special  you tell me  what do you see  the sun will rise the sun will set  nothing special at all  look  dont tell the doctor i said anything cos hell kill me  but ive got a prophecy too  evelina im sorry but youve got to hear me out   sisters  evelina can you hear me  listen  there is only one prophecy  but everything im about to say to you is true i swear  just listen to me  tomorrow that mountain is gonna explode  evelina please listen  the air is gonna fill with ash and rocks  tons and tons of it  and this whole town is gonna get buried thats not true  im sorry  im really sorry   but everyones going to die  a new prophecy  impossible there is only one  even if you dont believe me tell your family to get out of town  just for one day just for tomorrow but youve got to get out   youve got to leave pompeii  this is false prophecy  the noble woman  she spoke of a new prophecy the fall of pompeii  pompeii will last forever   then what must we do  the false prophet must die  sacrifice her  put this one there  this one  there  er keep that one upside down what have you got   enlighten me  what the soothsayer doesnt know  a seed may float on the breeze in any direction  yeah i knew you would say that   but its an energy converter  an energy converter of what  i dont know  isnt that brilliant i love not knowing keeps me on my toes  it must be awful being a prophet  waking up every morning is it raining yes i said so  takes all the fun out of life but who designed this lucius hm   who gave you these instructions  i think youve babbled enough  lucius tell me honestly im on your side   i can help  you insult the gods  there can be only one sentence at arms  oh morituri te salutant  celtic prayers wont help you now  but sir he made me do it   mr dextrus please dont  come on now quintus  dignity in death  i respect your victory lucius  shake on it  come on  dying mans wish   but hes  show me  the work of the gods  hes stone  armless enough though whoops quintus   run  the carvings  run  my carvings  the work is unbroken  oh lord of the mountain i beseech you  this man  would prevent the rise of pompeii  lord i beg of you show yourself  show yourself  no sign of them  nice little bit of allonsy i think were all right  but his arm doctor  is that happening to evelina  what was that  the mountain  no its closer   footsteps  it cant be   footsteps underground  what is it  what is it  what is it whats that noise  doesnt sound like vesuvius  caecilius all of you get out   doctor what is it  i think were being followed  just get out  the gods are with us  water we need water  quintus all of you get water donna  blest are we to see the gods  talk to me thats all i want  talk to me just tell me who you are  dont hurt these people  im the doctor just tell me who you are  doctor  what was it  carapace of stone held together by internal magma  not too difficult to stop but i reckon thats just the foot soldier  doctor or whatever your name is  you bring bad luck on this house  i thought your son was brilliant arent you going to thank him  still  if there are aliens at work in pompeii  its a good thing we stayed  donna  donna  donna  you have got to be kidding me  the false prophet will surrender both her blood   and her breath  ill surrender you in a minute  dont you dare   you will be silent  listen sister  you might have eyes on the back of your hands  but youll have eyes be in the back of your head by the time ive finished with you  let me go  this prattling voice will cease forever  oh thatll be the day  no man is allowed to enter the temple of sibyl  well thats all right just us girls  do you know i met the sibyl once hell of a woman  blimey she could dance the tarantella nice teeth  truth be told i think she had a bit of a thing for me  i said it would never last she said i know  well she would   you alright there  oh never better   i like the toga  thank you   and the ropes  yeah not so much  what magic is this  let me tell you about the sibyl the founder of this religion  she would be ashamed of you  all her wisdom and insight turned sour  is that how you spread the word on the blade of a knife  yes a knife that now welcomes you  show me this man  high priestess the stranger would defile us  let me see this one is different  he carries starlight in his wake  oh very perceptive  where do these words of wisdom come from   the gods whisper to me  theyve done far more than that  might i beg audience look upon the high priestess  oh my god   whats happened to you  the heavens have blessed me  if i might   does it hurt  it is necessary   who told you that  the voices  is that whats gonna happen to evelina  is this whats gonna happen to all of you  the blessings are manifold   theyre stone  exactly  the people of pompeii are turning to stone before the volcano erupts   but why  this word this image in your mind  this volcano what is that  more to the point why dont you know about it   who are you  high priestess of the sibylline  no no no no no im talking to the creature inside you  the thing seeding itself into a human body  in the dust in the lungs  taking over the flesh and turning it into   what  your knowledge  is impossible  oh but you can read my mind you know its not  i demand you tell me who you are  we are awakening  the voice of the gods  words of wisdom words of power words of wisdom words of power  name yourself planet of origin  galactic coordinates  species designation according to the universal  ratification of the shadow proclamation  we   are rising  tell me your name  pyrovile  pyrovile pyrovile pyrovile   whats a pyrovile  well thats a pyrovile growing inside her   shes the halfway stage  and that turns into  that thing in the villa was an adult pyrovile  and the breath of a pyrovile will incinerate you doctor  i warn you im armed  donna get that grille open   what for  just  what are the pyrovile doing here  we fell from the heavens  we fell so far and so fast we were rendered into dust  right creatures of stone shattered on impact  when was that 17 years ago  we have slept beneath for thousands of years  ok so 17 years ago woke you up  and now youre using human bodies to reconstitute yourselves   but why the psychic powers  we opened their minds and found such gifts  ok so you force yourself inside a human brain  use the latent psychic talent to bond  i get that i get that  but seeing the future that is way beyond psychic  you can see through time  where does the gift of prophecy come from  got it   now get down  what down there  yes down there  why cant they predict a volcano why is it being hidden  sisters i see into his mind  the weapon is harmless  yeah but its gotta sting  get down there  you fought her off with a water pistol  i bloody love you  this way   where are we going now  into the volcano   no way  yes way  appian way  the stranger would threaten our great endeavour  the time has come  the prophecy must advance  the prophecy must advance  thy will be done   summon the cult of vulcan  yes sir  we must go to the mountain  vesuvius awaits  sunrise my love  a new day  even the longest night must end  the mountains worse than ever  we killed a messenger of the gods in our own house  sweetheart can you see  tell us  whats going to happen  just leave her alone   i can see  what is it  a choice  someone must make a choice  the most terrible choice  but if its aliens setting off the volcano  doesnt that make it all right for you to stop it  still part of history  but im history to you  you saved me in 2008 you saved us all whys that different  some things are fixed some things are in flux   pompeii is fixed  how do you know which is which  because thats how i see the universe  every waking second i can see what is what was  what could be what must not  thats the burden of the time lord donna  and im the only one left   how many people died  stop it  doctor how many people died   is that what you can see doctor  all 20000  and you think thats all right do you  they know were here come on  almighty vesuvius  accept these offerings in vulcans design  and show unto us i beseech you the gods of the underworld  its the heart of vesuvius  were right inside the mountain  theres tons of them  whats that thing  oh hurry up and think of something rocky falls on its way  thats how they arrived  or whats left of it escape pod  prison ship  gene bank  but why do they need a volcano  maybe  it erupts and they launch themselves back into space or something  oh its worse than that  how could it be worse  doctor its getting closer  heathens  defile us  they would desecrate your temple my lord gods  come on   we cant go in  well we cant go back  crush them  burn them  there is nowhere to run doctor and daughter of london  now then lucius my lords pyrovillian  dont get yourselves in a lava   in a lava  no  no no but if i might beg the wisdom of the gods  before we perish  once this new race of creatures is complete  then what  my masters will follow the example of rome itself  an almighty empire bestriding the whole of civilisation  but if youve crashed  and youve got all this technology  why dont you just go home  the heaven of pyrovillia is gone  what do you mean gone wheres it gone  it was taken pyrovillia is lost  but there is heat enough in this world for a new species to rise  yeah i should warn you its 70 water out there  water can boil and everything will burn doctor  then the whole planet is at stake  thank you thats all i needed to know  donna  you have them my lords  could we be any more trapped  little bit hot  see the energy converter takes the lava  uses the power to create a fusion matrix  which welds pyrovile to human  its complete they can convert millions  cant you change it with these controls  course i can but dont you see  thats why the soothsayers cant see the volcano there is no volcano  vesuvius is never going to erupt  the pyrovile are stealing all its power  theyll use it to take over the world  but you can change it back  i can invert the system set off the volcano and blow them up yes  but thats the choice donna  its pompeii or the world  oh my god  if pompeii is destroyed then its not just history  its me  i make it happen  but the pyrovile are rocks maybe they cant be blown up  vesuvius explodes with the force of 24 nuclear bombs  nothing can survive it  certainly not us  never mind us  push this lever and its over   nooooooo  a new prophecy  the future is changing  the sky is falling  death only death  it was an escape pod  out out everybody out  quickly  you lied to us  and yet this was meant to be  dont  dont go to the

not the whole town  just save someone  come with me  its never forgotten caecilius  oh time will pass men will move on and stories will fade  but one day  pompeii will be found again  in thousands of years  and everyone will remember you  what about you evelina  can you see anything  the visions have gone  the explosion was so powerful it cracked open a rift in time  just for a second thats what gave you the gift of prophecy  it echoed back into the pyrovillian alternative  but not any more  youre free  but tell me  who are you doctor  with your words and your temple containing such size
