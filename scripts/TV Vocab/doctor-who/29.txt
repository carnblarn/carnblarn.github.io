knows  there we go  hungry  oh thanks  but how far down is it to this fast lane  right at the bottom under the traffic jam  not many people can afford three passengers  so its empty down there  rumour has it you can reach up to 30mph  wow thats like crazy  but how are you supposed to live inside this thing its tiny  oh we stocked up  weve got selfreplicating fuel  muscle stimulants for exercise a chemical toilet at the back  and all waste products are recycled as food  ok  another gap  this is brilliant  car 465 diamond 6 on descent to fast lane thank you very much  please drive safely  i need

tunnel  no but the stories are much better  they say people go missing on the motorway  some cars just vanish never to be seen again  cos theres something living down there  in the smoke  something huge  and hungry  and if you get lost on the road  its waiting for you  like i said  air vents   thats the end of the next layby  except look out there  does it look like the air vents are working  no

everyone what happened  a new chemical  a new mood  they called it bliss  everyone tried it  they couldnt stop  a virus mutated inside the compound and became airborne  everything perished  even the virus in the end  it killed the world in seven minutes flat  there was just enough time to close down the walkways and the flyovers sealing off the undercity  those people on the motorway arent lost doctor  they were saved  so the whole thing down there is running on automatic   theres not enough power to get them out  we did all we could to stop the system from choking  whos we how did you survive  he protected me  and he has waited for you these long years  doctor  the face of boe  i knew you would come   back in the old days  i was made his nurse  as penance for my sins  old friend what happened to you  failing  he protected me from the virus by shrouding me in his smoke  but with no one to maintain it the citys power died  the undercity would have fallen into the sea  so he saved them  the face of boe wired himself into the mainframe  hes giving his life force just to keep things running  but there are planets out there you couldve called for help  the last act of the senate was to declare new earth unsafe   the automatic quarantine lasts for 100 years  so the two of you stayed here   on your own for all these years  we had no choice  yes you did  save them doctor

and  they dont even know where i am  my mum and dad  if i died here theyd never know  so um who is he then  this doctor  i dont know  well not really  theres so much he never says   but that means
