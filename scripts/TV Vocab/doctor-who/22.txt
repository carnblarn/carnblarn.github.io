impossible  this lump of rock is suspended in perpetual geostationary orbit  around that black hole without falling in  some sort of power source is holding us here  were drilling down to try and find it  the tardis is gone  whatever it is its not a natural phenomenon  some form of civilisation  they buried something  what are they called  theyre the ood basic slave race  theres something happening with the ood    all and you will worship him  you can tell toby what weve found is civilisation  these are the words of the beast   and he has woken  ood i have been imprisoned for eternity  but no more  the pit is open  and i am free  doctor who theme  open fire  were stabilising  weve got orbit  doctor static hiss  doctor can you hear me doctor ida are you there  its me  but theyre coming its

what the voice said but theres nothing   i mean theres nothing coming out  no no sign of the beast  it said satan come on rose keep it together  is there no such thing  doctor  doctor tell me theres no such thing   ida i recommend that you withdraw immediately  but weve come all this way    ok that was an order withdraw  when that opened the whole planet shifted  one more inch and we fall into the black hole this stops now  but its not much better up there with the ood  im initiating strategy nine  so i need the two of you back up top immediately no arg    ida ida   what do you think  he gave an order  yeah but what do you think  it said i am the temptation   if theres something in there    whys it still hiding  maybe weve opened the prison but not the cell  we should go down  id go  what about you ohh in a second but then again    that is so human  where angels fear to tread  even now standing on the edge  its that feeling you get yeah  right at the back of your head  that impulse  that strange little impulse  that mad little voice saying go on go on go on  go over go on     maybe its relying on that  for once in my life officer scott  im going to say    retreat  ohh  now i know im getting old  rose were coming back  best news ive heard all day  what are you doing  hes infected he brought that thing on board  you saw it  are you gonna start shooting your own people now is that what youre gonna do is it if necessary  well then youll have to shoot me if necessary so whats it gonna be  look at his face whatever it was its gone  it passed into the ood you saw it happen  hes clean  any sign of trouble ill shoot him  you all right  yeah  um dunno can you remember anything just    it was so angry  it was fury and rage and  death  it was him  it was the devil  come on  whats strategy nine open the airlocks  well be safe inside the lockdown the ood will get thrown out into the vacuum  so were going back to a slaughter  the devils work  communicator hisses ok were in bring us up   ascension in three two one  this is the darkness   this is my domain  you little things that live in the light  clinging to your feeble suns  which die in the end    thats not the ood something is talking through them  only the darkness remains  this is captain zachary cross flane of sanctuary base six  representing the torchwood archive you will identify yourself  you know my name  what do you want  you will die here all of you  this planet is your grave  its him its him its him  if you are the beast then answer me this which one  cos the universe has been busy since youve been gone  theres more religions than there are planets  the arkiphets quoldonity christianity pashpash  new judaism san claar the church of the tin vagabond    which devil are you all of them  what then youre the truth behind the myth   this one knows me  as i know him the killer of his own kind  how did you end up on this rock  the disciples of the light rose up against me  and chained me in the pit for all eternity  when was this before time  what does that mean before time  what does before time mean  before time and light and space and matter  before the cataclysm  before this universe was created  thats impossible no life could have existed back then  is that your religion  its a belief you know nothing  all of you so small  the captain so scared of command  the soldier haunted by the eyes of his wife  the scientist still running from daddy  the little boy who lied  the virgin  and the lost girl  so far away from home  the valiant child who will die in battle so very soon  doctor what does that mean  rose dont listen what does it mean   you will die     and i will live  what the hell was that  i had that thing inside my head  doctor what did it mean  what do we do jefferson zack what do we do captain     the orbit the planet the black hole  everythings true  how did it know that did anyone     what battle what did it mean stop what do we do  feedback whines  if you want voices in the dark listen to mine its playing on basic fears  darkness childhood nightmares all that stuff but thats how the devil works or a good psychologist  how did it know about my father  ok but what makes his version of the truth any better than mine  cos ill tell you what i can see humans brilliant humans  humans who travelled all the way across space flying in a tiny rocket  into the orbit of a black hole just for the sake of discovery  thats amazing dyou hear me amazing  all of you the captain his officer his elder  his juniors his friends  all with one advantage the beast is alone we are not  if we can use that to fight against him    the cable snapped get out  doctor we lost the cable  doctor are you all right doctor  comms are down doctor can you hear me   ive still got lifesigns but  weve lost the capsule  theres no way out  theyre stuck down there  how much air have we got    but weve got to bring them back  theyre ten miles down we havent got another ten miles of cable  explosion captain  situation report  banging  its the ood  theyre cutting through the doorbolts theyre breaking in  yes same on door 25 how longs it gonna take  well its only a basic frame should take ten minutes  eight  ive got a security frame  it might last a bit longer  but that doesnt help you right so weve got to stop them or get out or both  ill take both yeah but how   you heard the doctor why dyou think that thing cut him off  cos he was making sense he was telling you to think your way out of this  come on for starters we need some light  zack theres got to be some sort of power somewhere theres nothing i can do  some captain stuck in here pressing buttons  but thats what the doctor meant press the right buttons theyve gutted the generators  but  the rockets got an independent supply  if i can reroute that    mr jefferson open the bypass conduits  override the safety  opening bypass conduits sir  channeling rocket feed  in three two one  power  there we go let there be light what about that strategy nine thing  not enough power  needs 100  right we need a way out zack mr jefferson start working on that  toby what about you im not a soldier  no youre the archaeologist what do you know about the pit  we cant even translate the language but   hold on maybe    what is it  since that thing was inside my head the letters make more sense  then get to work anything you can translate just  anything  as for you danny boy youre in charge of the ood any way of stopping them  well   i dont know  then find out  sooner we get control of this base the sooner we can get the doctor out now get going shift  weve got all this cable might as well use it  the drums disconnected we could adapt it feed it through    and then what  abseil  into the pit  abseil right  were running out of air with no way back its the only thing we can do  even if its the last thing we ever achieve  ill get back rose is up there  then maybe the key to that is finding out whats in the pit  well its half of a good plan  whats the other half  i go down not you  junctions 5 6 7    reroute filters 16 to 24 go  theres all sorts of viruses that could stop the ood  trouble is we havent got them on board  well thats handy listing things we havent got  we havent got a swimming pool either or a tesco  oh my god it says yes i can do it  hypothetically if you flip the monitor broadcast a flare  it can disrupt the telepathy brainstorm  what happens to the ood  itll tank them sparkout  there we are then  do it  no but id have to transmit from the central monitor  we need to go to ood habitation  thats what well do then  mr jefferson sir any way out  just about theres a network of maintenance tunnels  running underneath the base  ventilation shafts i appreciate the reference but theres no ventilation  no air in fact  they were designed for machines not lifeforms  but i can manipulate the oxygen field from here  create discrete pockets of atmosphere  if i control it manually i can follow you through the network  right so   we go down and you make the air follow us by hand  you wanted me pressing buttons yep i asked for it ok  we need to get to ood habitation work out a route  that should hold it  hows it going fine should work  doesnt feel like such a good idea now  there it is again that itch  go down go down go down go down    the urge to jump dyou know where it comes from that sensation  genetic heritage ever since we were primates in the trees  its our bodys way of testing us  calculating whether or not we can reach the next branch  no thats not it  thats too kind  its not the urge to jump its deeper than that  its the urge to fall  doctor  you ok not bad thanks  wall of the pit seems to be the same as the cavern  just   not much of it  theres a crust about 20ft down and then    nothing just the pit  ok then lower me down  here we go then  danny hold on just conforming  danny weve got to go now come on  there put that into the monitor and its a bad time to be an ood  were coming back got that  were coming back and getting the doctor out  ok danny you go first then you then toby ill go last  now come on quick as you can  god it stinks you all right yeah laughing   which way do we go just go straight ahead keep going till i say so  not your best angle danny oi stop it  i dunno could be worse oi  straight on till you find junction 71 keep breathing  im feeding you air ive got you  were at 71 sir  ok ive got you  im just aerating the next section  getting kinda cramped sir cant you hurry it up  im working on halfpower here stop complaining  mr jefferson said stop complaining i heard he heard  the airs getting a bit thin hes complaining now i heard  danny is that you im not exactly happy  im just moving the air ive got to oxygenate the next section  now keep calm or its gonna feel worse  clatter  what was that mr jefferson what was that what was that noise  captain what was that  the junction in habitation fives been opened it must be the ood  theyre in the tunnels well open the gate ive got to get the air in just open it sir  where are they are they close i cant tell i cant see them  the computer doesnt register ood as proper lifeforms  whose idea was that  open the gate  danny turn left immediate left  the ood sir  cant you trap them cut off the air  not without cutting off yours  danny turn right go right   go faster theyre gonna catch up  ill maintain defensive position you cant stop  miss tyler thats my job youve got your task  now see to it  you heard what he said now shift   zack open 82  ive got to aerate it open it now  im trying  danny stop it thats not helping  zack get it open  jefferson ive got to open 82 by closing 81  youve got to get past the junction now move  thats an order now move  im gonna lose oxygen jefferson i cant stop the automatics  thats it come on come on  danny turn left head for 92 thats the last one  jefferson youve got to move faster  john move move mr jefferson  come on keep going  regret to inform you sir  i was a bit slow  not so fast these days   i cant open 81 john  not without losing air for the others  and quite right too sir  i think i bought them a little time  theres nothing i can do john   im sorry  youve done enough sir made a very good captain under the circumstances  might i ask if you cant add oxygen to this section  can you speed up the process of its removal  i dont understand what dyou mean  well if i might choose the manner of my departure sir  lack of air seems more natural than    well lets say death by ood  id appreciate it sir  godspeed mr jefferson  thank you sir  report officer john maynard jefferson pkd  deceased with honours   zack  were at the final junction   and uh    if my respects could be on record he saved our lives  noted opening 92  lower 92 zack lower it back back back  we cant go back 82s sealed off  were stuck  come on up  come on toby come on   toby get out of there  help me oh my god help me  its this way  explosion  hurry it up  get it in danny get it done  transmit im trying im trying im getting it in    stop them   danny get that thing transmitting  electronic screech  you did it we did it  yes oh yes  zack we did it the ood are down now weve got to get the doctor  on my way  you get representations of the horned beast across the universe  in the myths and legends of a million worlds  earth draconia vel consadine daemos  the kaled god of war   the same image over and over again  maybe that idea came from somewhere  bleeding through  a thought at the back of every sentient mind  emanating from here  could be if this is the original    does that make it real does that make it the actual devil though  well if thats what you want to believe  maybe thats what the devil is in the end an idea  thats it  thats all weve got  you getting any sort of readout  nothing  could be miles to go  or could be 30 feet theres no way of telling  i could survive 30 feet  oh no you dont im pulling you back up  what are you doing   you bring me back and were just gonna sit there and run out of air  ive got to go down  but you cant doctor you cant  call it an act of faith  i dont want to die on my own  i know  doctor are you there  doctor ida can you hear me  the comms are still down i can patch them through the central desk  and boost the signal   just give me a minute  i didnt ask have you got any sort of faith or    not really  i was brought up neoclassic congregational  cos of my mum she was    my old mum  but no i never believed  neoclassics have they got a devil  no  not as such  just   the things that men do  same thing in the end and what about you  i believe   i believe i havent seen everything  i dunno  funny isnt it  the things you make up the rules  if that thing had said it came from beyond the universe id believe it  but before the universe impossible  doesnt fit my rules  still maybe thats why i keep travelling  to be proved wrong  thank you ida  dont go  if they get back in touch    if you talk to rose just tell her    tell her    oh she knows  doctor are you there  doctor ida can you hear me  are you there doctor hes gone  what dyou mean hes gone  he fell  into the pit  i dont know how deep it is miles and miles and miles  but   what dyou mean he fell  i couldnt stop him  he said your name  im sorry  ida   theres no way of reaching you  no cable no backup youre ten miles down  we cant get there  you should see this place zack  its beautiful  i wanted to discover things  and here i am  weve got to abandon the base  im declaring this mission unsafe  all we can do is make sure noone ever comes here again  but well never find out what it was  maybe thats best  yeah  officer scott   its all right  just go  good luck and you  danny toby close down the feedlinks get the retrotopes online  then get to the rocket and strap yourselves in were leaving  im not going rose theres space for you  no im gonna wait for the doctor  just like hed wait for me  im sorry but   hes dead  you dont know him  cos hes not  im telling you hes not    and even if he was how could i leave him  all on his own all the way down there no im gonna stay  then   i

move  its the telepathic field its reasserting itself  move it get to the rocket move  ughhh    im breathing  air cushion to support the fall  you can breathe down here ida  can you hear me ida  dislocating b clamp c clamp raising blunitro to maximum hows the negapact feed line  clear ready to go sir oh for gods sake get us out of here  captain think were gonna have a problem keep an eye on her  what did you    its all right rose were safe  im not going anywhere get me out of this thing   get me out aaaaand lift off  they cheer  the rocket  take me back to the planet  take me back or what  or ill shoot  would you though  would you really is that what your doctor would want  im sorry but its too late anyway take a look outside  we cant turn back  and this is what the doctor would have wanted isnt that right  history of some big battle   man against beast  dunno if youre getting this ida hope so  anyway they defeated the beast and imprisoned it  and maybe thats the key  or the gate or the bars or    deep rumbling  beast growls  whats the joke just   we made it  we escaped we actually did it  not all of us were not out of it yet  were still the first people in history to fly away from a black hole  toby read me the stats  gravity funnel holding sir  ohh its holding  i accept that you exist  i dont have to accept what you are but your physical existence i give you that  growling  i dont understand i was expected down here  i was given a safe landing and air grunt  you need me for something  what for  have i got to     i dont know beg an audience or     is there a ritual  some sort of incantation or summons or spell  all those things i dont believe in are they real  speak to me tell me  you wont talk  or  you cant talk  beast roars  hold on hold on wait a minute just let me    oh no  yes no  think it through you spoke before i heard your voice  an intelligent voice no more than that brilliant  but looking at you now all i can see    beast roars    is the beast  the animal  just  the body  youre just the body the physical form what happened to your mind  hmm  weres it gone wheres that intelligence  oh no    stats at 53 funnel stable at 665 hull pressure constant  smooth as we can sir all the way back home  coordinates set for planet earth  youre imprisoned long time ago  before the universe after sideways in between doesnt matter  and the prison is perfect  its absolute its eternal    oh yes  open the prison and the gravity field collapses  this planet falls into the black hole  you escape you die brilliant  but thats just the body  the bodys trapped thats all  the devil is an idea in all those civilisations just an idea  but an idea is hard to kill  an idea can escape  the mind the mind of the great beast the mind can escape  oh but thats it  you didnt give me air your jailers did  they set this up all those years ago  they need me alive  because if youre escaping then ive got to stop you  beast roars  if i destroy your prison your body is destroyed  your mind with it  but then youre clever enough to use this whole system against me  if i destroy this planet then i destroy the gravity field  the rocket the rocket loses protection  falls into the black hole  i have to sacrifice rose  beast cackles  it doesnt make sense  we escaped but theres a thousand ways it couldve killed us  it couldve ripped out the air or burnt us or anything  but it let us go  why  unless it wanted us to escape  hey rose do us a favour  shut up  almost there were beyond the reach of the black hole in 40 39    so thats the trap  or the test or the final judgement i dont know  but if i kill you i kill her  except that implies  in this big grand scheme of gods and devils  shes just a victim  but ive seen a lot of the universe  ive seen fake gods and bad gods  and demigods and wouldbe gods  and out of all that out of that whole pantheon  if i believe in one thing  just one thing    i believe in her  what was that whats he doing what is he doing   weve lost the funnel gravity collapse  what does that mean we cant escape  were heading straight for the black hole  this is your freedom   free to die  youre going into the black hole and im riding with you  its the planet the planets moving  its falling  i am the rage and the bile and the ferocity  i am the prince and the fool and the agony its him its toby  i am the sin and the fear and the darkness the ships not stable  what is he what the hell is he   i shall never die  the thought of me is for ever  in the bleeding hearts of men in their vanity and obsession and lust  nothing shall ever destroy me nothing  go to hell  emergency shield  beast howls  weve still lost the gravity funnel  we cant escape the black hole  but we stopped him thats what the doctor would have done  some victory were going in    the planets lost orbit its falling  the doctor laughs  the planets gone  im sorry accelerating  i did my best  but hey first human beings to fall inside a black hole  how about that  history  what happened  were turning  were turning around  were turning away  communicator hisses  sorry about the hijack captain this is the good ship tardis   now first things first have you got a rose tyler on board  im here its me  oh my god where are you  im just towing you home  gravity shmavity  my people practically invented black holes  in fact they did couple of minutes well be nice and safe  oh and captain can we do a swap  say if you give me rose tyler ill give you ida scott how about that  shes alive  thank god  yeah bit of oxygen starvation but she should be all right  i couldnt save the ood  i only had time for one trip  they went down with the planet  tardis bleeps  entering clear space  end of the line mission closed  i dont know i cant remember   well it looked like a box  what dyou mean a box  down in the hold a big blue box  it just appeared  i dont know  zack well be off now have a good trip home   and the next time you get curious about something    oh whats the point youll just go blundering in  the human race but doctor   what did you find down there  that creature what was it  i dont know never did decipher that writing  but thats good day i know everything i might as well stop  what do you think it was really  i think  we beat it  thats good enough for me it said i was going to die in battle  then it lied  right onwards
