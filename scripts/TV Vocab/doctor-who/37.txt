                cardiff cardiff ah but thing about cardiff  its built on a rift in time and space just like california  on the san andreas fault but the rift bleeds energy  i open up the engines soak up the energy and use it as fuel  so its a pit stop exactly  should only take 20 seconds  the rifts been active  wait they had an earthquake in cardiff couple of years ago was that you  doctor  finito all powered up  whats that  were accelerating into the future the year one billion  five billion five trillion   the year 100 trillion  thats impossible why what happens then  were going to the end of the universe  doctor  humans  humans are coming  i dont  i just want to go please let me go  huuuuuumaaan  huuuuuumaaan huuuuuumaaan  they growl and grunt  hunt hunt  hunt hunt  theres movement on the surface  another human hunt god help him  chan should i alert the guards tho no no we cant spare them  poor beggars on his own one more lost soul dreaming of utopia  chan you mustnt talk as though youve given up tho  no no indeed heres to it  utopia  where it is to be hoped the coffee is a little less sour  will you join me i am happy drinking my own internal milk tho  yes well thats quite enough information thank you  professor yana  dont want to rush you but how are we doing   yes yes working yes almost there  hows it looking on the footprint   its good yes fine excellent  theres no problem as such weve accelerated the calculation  matrix but its going to take time to harmonise though  were trying a new reversal process well have a definite  result in approximately two hours though  chan professor  voice drowned out by loud drumming chan professor yana tho  chan professor tho  yes yes yes working  chan its the surface scanner professor it seems to be detecting a different signal tho  well thats not a standard reading  i cant make it out it would seem something new has arrived  well weve landed  so whats out there i dont know  ooh say that again thats rare  not even the time lords came this far  we should leave  we should go we should really really  go  oh my god  cant get a pulse hold on youve got that medical kit thing  hello again  ohh im sorry here we go  get out the way its a bit odd not very hundred trillion that coats more like world war two  i think he came with us from earth mustve been clinging to the tardis  all the way through the vortex well thats very him  d you know him friend of mine used to travel with me  back in the old days  but hes  im sorry theres no heartbeat theres nothing  hes dead  oh well so much for me its all right just breathe deep ive got you  captain jack harkness  and who are you martha jones nice to meet you martha jones  oh dont start i was only saying hello i dont mind  doctor  captain  good to see you  and you same as ever although  have you had work done  you can talk  yes the face regeneration how did you know this was me  the police box kind of gives it away ive been following you  for a long time  you abandoned me  did i busy life moving on  ive just got to ask  the battle of canary wharf  i saw the list of the dead  and it said rose tyler  oh no sorry shes alive youre kidding  parallel world safe and sound and mickey and her mother oh yes  good old rose  so there i was stranded in the year  and he goes off without me but i had this  i used to be a time agent its called a vortex manipulator  hes not the only one who can time travel excuse me that is not time travel  its like ive got a sports car youve got a spacehopper  oh boys and their toys  all right so i bounced i thought 21st century best place to find the doctor  except i got it a little wrong arrived in useless  told you  i lived through the entire 20th century waiting for a version of you that coincided with me  but that makes you more than 100 years old and looking good dont you think  so i went to the time rift based myself there cos i knew  youd come back to refuel until finally i get a signal on this  detecting you and here we are but how come you left him behind doctor i was busy  is that what happens d you just get bored of us one day and disappear  not if youre blonde oh what a surprise you two  were at the end of the universe  right at the edge of knowledge itself and youre busy  blogging  come on  is that a city  city or a hive or a nest  or a conglomeration  like it was grown  but look there thats like  pathways or roads there mustve been some sort of life  long ago what killed it  time just time everythings dying now  all the great civilisations have gone  this isnt just night  all the stars have burnt up and faded away  into nothing  they must have an atmospheric shell  we should be frozen to death  well martha and i maybe  not so sure about you jack  but what about the people  does noone survive  i suppose  i have to hope  life will find a way  well hes not doing too bad  is it me or does that look like a hunt come on  oh ive missed this  shouting and growling  ive got you theyre coming theyre coming  growling  jack dont you dare  gunshots  what the hell are they weve got to keep going  ive got a ship nearby its safe its over there or maybe not  were close to the silo if we get to the silo then were safe silo silo silo for me  its the futurekind  theyre coming let us in show me your teeth  show me your teeth show me your teeth show him your teeth  human let them in let them in  close close close  rapid gunfire  humaaaaans  human meat  make feast  go back to where you came from i said go back back  dont tell him to put his gun down hes not my responsibility and i am that makes a change  watching you  kind hungry  yeah  thanks for that right lets get you inside  my name is padra fet shafe cane tell me  just tell me can you take me to utopia  oh yes sir yes i can  professor weve got four new humans inside one of them is calling himself a doctor  of medicine he says of everything what a scientist  oh my word chantho just  i dont know im coming  its like a box a big blue box  i need it back its stuck out there  youre 561 my family were heading for the silo did they get here  my mother is kistane shafe cane my brothers name is beltone  you can check the paperwork creet passenger needs help what d you need  a blue box you said big tall wooden says police  were driving out for the last water collection ill see what i can do thank you  we could still take a look come on  sorry but how old are you  old enough to work this way  kistane shafe cane  kistane and beltone shafe cane  im looking for kistane and beltone shafe cane  the shafe canes anyone anyone  kistane from red falls five kistane and beltone shafe cane  anyone know the shafe cane family  anyone called shafe cane  its like a refugee camp  its stinking  sorry no offence not you  dont you see though the ripe old smell of humans you survived  oh you mightve spent a million years evolving into clouds of gas and another million as downloads  but you always revert to the same basic shape  indomitable  is there a kistane shafe cane thats me  mother oh my god padra  its not all bad news  captain jack harkness and who are you  stop it give us a hand with this  its halfdeadlocked see if you can overwrite the code lets find out where we are  ive got you thanks  how did you cope without me now that is what i call a rocket  theyre not refugees theyre passengers he said they were going to utopia  the perfect place hundred trillion years and its the same old dream d you recognise the engines  nope whatever it is its not rocket science  but its hot though boiling  but if the universe is falling apart what does utopia mean  the doctor thats me  good good good good good good good good good good good good good  its good apparently  chan welcome tho  this is the gravitissimal accelerator its past its best  chan welcome though and over here is the footprint impeller system  d you know anything about end time gravity mechanics who are you  chan chantho tho  but we cant get it to harmonise  captain jack harkness stop it cant i say hello to anyone  chan i do not protest tho  maybe later blue  so what have we got here and all this feeds into the rocket  except without a stable footprint well never achieve escape velocity  if only we could harmonise the five impact patterns and unify them well we might yet make it  what d you think doctor  any ideas well  um basically sort of  not a clue nothing  im not from round these parts ive never seen a system like it sorry  no no im sorry its my fault  theres been so little help  oh my god  youve got a hand a hand in a jar  a hand in jar in your bag  thats  thats my hand  i said i had a doctordetector  is this is a tradition amongst your people  what d you mean thats your hand youve got both your hands i can see them  i lost my hand christmas day in a swordfight  what and you grew another hand  um yeah yeah i did yeah  hello might i ask what species are you  time lord  last of  heard of them  legend or anything  not even a myth blimey end of the universe is a bit humbling  chan it is said that i am the last of my species too tho sorry what was your name  my assistant and good friend chantho a survivor of the malmooth  this was their planet malcassairo before we took refuge  that city outside that was yours chan the conglomeration died tho  conglomeration thats what i said youre supposed to say sorry oh yes  sorry chan most grateful tho  you grew another hand hello again  its fine look really its me  all this time and youre still full of surprises  chan you are most unusual tho well  so what about those things outside the beastie boys  we call them the futurekind  which is a myth in itself but its feared they are what we will become  unless we reach utopia and utopia is  every human knows of utopia  where have you been bit of a hermit  a hermit with friends  hermits united we meet up every ten years swap stories about caves  its good fun for a hermit  so um utopia  the call came from across the stars  over and over again  come to utopia  originating from that point  where is that oh its far beyond the condensate wilderness  out towards the wildlands and the dark matter reefs calling us in  the last of the humans scattered across the night  what d you think is out there we cant know  a colony a city some sort of haven  the science foundation created the utopia project thousands of years ago  to preserve mankind to find a way of surviving  beyond the collapse of reality itself now perhaps they found it  perhaps not  but its worth a look dont you think  ohhh yes  and the signal keeps modulating so its not on automatic  thats a good sign someones out there  and thats ooh thats  a navigation matrix  doctors voice drowned out by loud drumming  professor  professor  right thats enough talk theres work to do now if you could leave thank you  are you all right yes im fine  and busy  except that rockets not going to fly is it  this footprint mechanismthing its not working  well find a way  youre stuck on this planet  and you havent told them have you  that lot out there they still think theyre gonna fly  well its better to let them live in hope quite right too  and i must say professor  what was it yana professor yana this new science is well beyond me  but all the same a boost reversal circuit in any timeframe must be  a circuit which reverses the boost so i wonder what would happen  if i did this  siren wails  chan its working tho  but how did you do that  oh weve been chatting away i forgot to tell you im brilliant  on tannoy all passengers prepare for boarding repeat all passengers prepare for immediate boarding  destination utopia   there  and there  tannoy all troops withdraw to silo repeat all troops withdraw to silo   inside everyone inside  come on move move move  on tannoy air passengers prepare for immediate boarding  air passengers prepare for immediate boarding   excuse me  hey what was your name creet  thats right miss who are you with creet you got family no miss theres just me  good luck what d you think its gonna be like in utopia  my mum used to say the skies are made of diamonds  good for her  go on off you go get your seat  she snarls  is that gluten extract  it binds the neutralino map together  but thats food  youve built this system out of food and string and staples professor yana youre a genius  says the man who made it work  aah its easy coming in at the end  but youre stellar this is this is magnificent  and i dont often say that cos well cos of me  but even my title is an affectation there hasnt been such a thing as a university for over 1000 years  ive spent my life going from one refugee ship to another  if youd been born in a different time youd be revered i mean it  throughout the galaxies  oh those damn galaxies they had to go and collapse  some admiration would have been nice  just a little just once well youve got it now  but that footprint enginething  you cant activate it from on board its got to be done from here  youre staying behind  with chantho  she wont leave without me  simply refuses youd give your life so they could fly  oh i think im a little too old for utopia  time i had some sleep  on tannoy professor tell the doctor weve found his blue box  aah  doctor  professor its a wild stab in the dark but i might just have found you a way out  extra power  little bit of a cheat but whos counting  jack youre in charge of the retro feeds  oh am i glad to see that thing chan professor are you all right  fine im fine im fine just get on with it  connect those circuits into the spar same as the last lot but quicker yes sir  you dont have to keep working we can handle it its just a headache just  noise inside my head doctor constant noise inside my head  what sort of noise  the sound of drums  more and more as though its getting closer  when did it start oh ive had it all my life  every waking hour  still no rest for the wicked  so how long have you been with the professor chan 17 years tho  blimey long time  chan i adore him tho  oh right and he chan i dont think he even notices tho  tell me about it  chan but i am happy to serve tho  d you have to start every sentence with chan  chan yes tho  and end every sentence with chan tho tho what would happen if you didnt  chan that would be rude tho  what like swearing  chan indeed tho  oh go on just once  chan i cant tho oh do it for me  no  professor  systems are down  professor you getting me  im here  were ready  all you need to do is connect the couplings then we can launch  god save us this equipment  needs rebooting all the time  anything i can do ive finished that lot yes if you could  just press the reboot key every time the picture goes certainly just dont ask me to do shorthand  are you still there  present and correct send your man inside  well keep the levels down from here  hes inside and good luck to him  captain keep the dials below the red where is that room its underneath the rocket  fix the couplings and the footprint can work  but the entire chamber is flooded with stet radiation stet never heard of it  you wouldnt want to but its safe enough we can hold the radiation back from here  alarm rings  its rising 02 keep it level yes sir  siren wails  were losing power tho  siren continues to wail  radiations rising weve lost control the chambers going to flood  jack override the vents  get out  get out of there jake  oi you  duck  we can jumpstart the override  dont its gonna flare  jake get out of there get out  noooooo  ive got him dont touch the cables tho  im so sorry the chambers flooded with radiation yes  without the couplings the engines will never start it was all for nothing  oh i dont know  professor youve got a room which no man can enter without dying is that correct  yes well  loud gasping breath  i think ive got just the man  was someone kissing me  lieutenant get on board the rocket youre going to fly the chambers flooded  weve found a way of tripping the system run  what are you taking your clothes off for im going in  well id say that stet radiation doesnt affect clothing only flesh well i look good though  how long have you known ever since i ran away from you  good luck  we lost picture when that thing flared up  doctor are you there receiving yeah hes inside  and still alive oh yes but he should evaporate  what sort of a man is he  ive only just met him the doctor sort of travels through time and space and picks people up  god i make us sound like stray dogs  maybe we are  he travels in time  dont ask me to explain it  thats a tardis that box thing  the sports car of time travel he says  when did you realise  echoing voice thats a tardis thats a tardis thats a tardis  when did you realise earth 1892  got in a fight on ellis island man shot me through the heart and then i woke up  thought it was kind of strange but then it never stopped  fell off a cliff trampled by horses world war one world war two poison starvation  a stray javelin in the end  i got the message  im the man who can never die  and all that time you knew thats why i left you behind  its not easy even just looking at you jack cos youre wrong  thanks but you are i cant help it  im a time lord its instinct its in my guts  youre a fixed point in time and space  youre a fact  and thats never meant to happen  even the tardis reacted against you tried to shake you off  flew all the way to the end of the universe to get rid of you so what youre saying is  youre prejudiced  i never thought of it like that shame on you yeah  last thing i remember back when i was mortal  i was facing three daleks death by extermination  and then i came back to life  what happened  rose  i thought youd sent her back home  she came back opened the heart of the tardis and absorbed the time vortex itself  what does that mean exactly  noones ever meant to have that power  if a time lord did that hed become a god a vengeful god  but she was human  i bring life  everything she did was so human  she brought you back to life  but she couldnt control it she brought you back forever  thats something i suppose   the final act of the time war was life  do you think she could change me back  i took the power out of her  shes gone jack  shes not just living on a parallel world shes trapped there  the walls have closed im sorry  yep i went back to her estate  in the nineties  just once or twice  watched her growing up  never said hello  timelines and all that  do you want to die oh this ones a little stuck  jack  i thought i did  i dunno  but this lot you see them out here surviving and thats fantastic  you might be out there somewhere i could go meet myself  well its the only man youre ever gonna be happy with  this new regeneration  its kinda cheeky  voice in head regeneration regeneration   i never understand half the things hes saying  whats wrong chan professor what is it time travel  they say there was time travel back in the old days  i never believed  but what would i know  stupid old man  never could keep time  always late always lost  even this thing  never worked  martha this watch is me im gonna become human  time and time and time again always running out on me  can i have a look at that oh its only an old relic  like me  where did you get it  hmmm  i was found with it what d you mean an orphan in the storm  i was a naked child found on the coast of the silver devastation  abandoned with only this  have you ever opened it why would i its broken  how d you know its broken if youve never opened it  its stuck its old its not meant to be  i dont know  ah  does it matter  no its nothing its  listen everythings fine up here im gonna see if the doctor needs me  yes now get out of there come on  lieutenant everyone on board ready and waiting  stand by two minutes to ignition  tannoy ready to launch  outer doors sealed countdown commences t minus 99 98   the footprint its a gravity pulse it stamps down the rocket shoots up bit primitive  its gonna take the both of us to keep it stable  doctor the professors got a fobwatch its the same as yours same writing on it same everything  dont be ridiculous i asked him he said hes had it his whole life  so hes got the same watch yeah but its not a watch its this chameleon thing  no no no its this its this thing  this device that rewrites biology changes a time lord into a human and its the same watch  it cant be that means he could be a time lord you might not be the last one  jack keep it level but thats brilliant isnt it  yes it is course it is depends which one  fantastic yeah but they died the time lords all of them they died  not if he was human what did he say martha what did he say  he looked at the watch like he could hardly see it  montage of voices tardis the time vortex  regeneration its the drums  the drums the drums the neverending drumbeat open me you human fool  open the light and summon me and receive my majesty  destroy him then you will give your power to me   chan yana wont you please take some rest tho  on tannoy 13 12 11 10   if he escaped the time war then its a perfect place to hide  the end of the universe  and think what the face of boe said his dying words he said  you are  not alone  chan professor yana tho  lieutenant have you done it did you get velocity have you done it  lieutenant have you done it  affirmative well see you in utopia   good luck  but youve locked them in tho get it open  get it open  not to worry my dear as one door closes another must open  chan you must stop tho  chan but youve lowered the defences the futurekind will get in tho  chan professor im so sorry  but i must stop you  you are destroying all our work  ohhhhhh  now i can say i was provoked  shouts and growling  did you never think all those years standing beside me to ask about that watch  never  did you never once think not ever that you could set me free  chan im sorry tho chan im so sorry  and you with your chan and your tho driving me insane  chan professor please that is not my name  the professor was an invention  so perfect a disguise that i forgot who i am  chan then who are you tho  i am the master  this way  professor professor let me in  let me in  jack get the door open now  professor professor where are you  professor professor are you there i need to explain whatever you do dont open that watch  utopia  theyre coming  open the door open the door please  im begging you professor please listen to me just open the door please  and locked let me in let me in  shes dead i broke the lock give me a hand  im begging you everythings changed its only the two of us were the only ones left  just let me in  killed by an insect  a girl  how inappropriate  but still if the doctor can be young and strong  then so can i  the master  reborn  he screams  doctor youd better think of something  ha ha ha ha  oh oh  now then doctor  ooh new voice in different pitches hello hello  hello  anyway why dont we stop and have a nice little chat while i tell you all  my plans and you can work out a way to stop me i dont think  hold on i know that voice  im asking you really properly just stop just think  use my name  master im sorry  tough  oh no you dont  end of the universe have fun bye bye  doctor stop him  shouts and screams
