she is not your mother  what is that mickey weve got power  youre a fine businessman john but youre not god  he is exactly the same  what are they cybermen  theres no need to damage us  were good stock we volunteer for the upgrade programme  take us to be processed you are rogue elements but we surrender  you are incompatible but this is a surrender  you will be deleted listen to me we surrender  you are inferior and will be reborn as cybermen  but you will perish under maximum deletion  delete delete delete  what the hell was that   or how about instead run  car horn beeps

weapon we do  might not work on those metal things but theyre good enough for men like him  leave him alone whats he done wrong  laid a trap thats wiped out the government and left lumic in charge  if i was part of that do you think id leave my wife inside  maybe it went wrong still gives us the right to execute you  talk about executions youll make me your enemy you dont want to do that  all the same we have evidence that says pete tylers been working for the lumics since 205  is that true  tell em mrs m  weve got a government mole feeds us information  lumics private files his south american operations the lot  secret broadcasts twice a week  broadcasts from gemini and how do you know that  im gemini thats me you would say that  encrypted wavelength 657 using binary nine  thats the only reason i was working for lumic to get information  i thought it was the security services what do i get  the scooby doo gang theyve even got the van  no no but the preachers know what theyre doing ricky said hes londons most wanted  yeah thats not exactly    not exactly what  im londons most wanted for parking tickets  oh great  i was fighting the system park anywhere  good policy i do much the

that then  i just did  they took my wife  she might still be alive  thats even worse  cos thats what lumic does  he takes the living    and turns them into those machines  cybermen theyre called cybermen and id take those ear pods off if i were you  you never know lumic could be listening  but hes over reached himself hes a businessman whos assassinated the president  all we need to do is inform the authorities  because i promise you this ends tonight  my everlasting children tell me how does it feel we feel nothing  but in your mind what do you think  we think the same  we are uniform but you think of what  we think of the humans we think of their difference and their pain  they suffer in the skin  they must be upgraded  excellent then lets begin  computer identify john lumic  voice print acknowledged  activate ear pod primary sequence  please state area of activation  the city of london ive just declared independence  begin transmission  alarm beeps  they will come to me  my new children  the immortal ones  the whole of london has been sealed off  there are reports of an army  an army of metal men all citizens should remove their ear pods  i repeat remove all ear pods london has been placed under martial law  if you are hearing this stay in your homes i repeat stay in your homes  electrical buzzing man groans  oh no you dont  what the hell whats going on  its the ear pods lumics taken control cant we just    i dunno take them off dont  cause a brainstorm  the human race for such an intelligent lot you arent half susceptible  give anyone a chance to take control and you submit  sometimes i think you like it an easy life  hey come and see  where are they all going  i dont know lumic must have a base of operations  battersea thats where he was building his prototypes  whys he doing it hes dying  this all started out as a way of prolonging life keeping the brain alive  at any cost thing is ive seen cybermen before havent i  the head those handle shapes in van stattens museum  there are cybermen in our universe they started on an ordinary world then swarmed across the galaxy  this lot are starting from scratch right here on earth  what are you on about  never mind that we need to get out of the city  ok split up mrs moore you look after that lot  jake distract them well meet back at bridge street move  im going with him  come on lets go  there  which way i dont know where we are  did they see us bet theyve got satellites they saw us in the dark  both they know where we are  i dont get it what is it with you  youre exactly like me  i dunno reckon youre braver ten times  still your friends arent bad  thats the doctor and rose i just tag along behind  well then youre not that bad  do you think yeah suppose  metallic marching  cybermen  both split up  go  tannoy chamber 12 now closed for sterilisation  all reject stock will be in incinerated  come on  come on  come on  he screams  no  cyberman this one is unprogrammed  mr crane i thought you were one of the faithful  oh that i am sir  my ear pod must have malfunctioned  for which i apologise  if i might  id like to request an upgrade sir  ive seen the future and its copyright cybus industries  sign me up a willing volunteer  youve known me a long time sir  quite a team you and me  ive been with you all the way  but believe me sir  knowing you so well i know exactly what to do  no no help me  die  help me you are in pain  we can remove pain forever  no not yet im not ready  we will give you immortality  ive told you i will upgrade    only with my last breath  then breathe no more  no no i command you no  i ran past the river you shouldve seen it the whole citys on the march  hundreds of cybermen all down the thames  here he is  which one are you  im sorry the cybermen   he couldnt   are you ricky  are you ricky  mickey thats you isnt it  yeah  he tried he was running  there was too many of them shut it  there was nothing i could do i said just shut it  dont even talk about him  youre nothing you are  nothing  we can mourn him when london is safe  for now we move on  the whole of londons been sealed off and the entire populations been taken inside that place  to be converted  weve got to get in there and shut it down  how do we do that  oh ill think of something  youre just making this up as you go along yep  but i do it brilliantly  mrs moore thats a schematic of the old factory  look cooling tunnels underneath the plant  big enough to walk through we go under then up into the control centre  theres another way in through the front door  if theyve taken jackie thats how shell get in  we cant just go strolling up  oh we could with these  fake ear pods  dead no signal but put them on and the cybermen would mistake you for one of the crowd  then thats my job  youd have to show no emotion any sign of emotion gives you away  how many of those have you got just two sets  ok  if thats the best way of finding jackie then im coming with you  why does she matter to you we havent got time doctor im going with him  no stopping you is there  nope  tell you what we can attack the ear pods at the same time  give people their minds back so they dont walk into that place like sheep jakey boy    lumics transmitting the control signal it must be from over there  there it is on the zeppelin do you see  great big transmitter its a good thing lumic likes showing off  reckon you can take it out  consider it done  mrs moore would you care to accompany me into the cooling tunnels  how could i refuse we attack on three sides  above between below into the control centre stop the conversion machines what about me  mickey you can um    what stay out of trouble be the tin dog  no those days are over  im going with jake i dont need you idiot  im not an idiot you got that  im offering to help  whatever  mickey  good luck  yeah you too  rose ill see you later yeah youd better  if we survive ill see you at the tardis  thats a promise  good luck  its freezing  any sign of a light switch  cant see a thing but ive got these  a device for every occasion ooh  put it on  havent got a hot dog in there have you im starving  of all the things to wish for thats mechanically recovered meat  i know its the cyberman of food but its tasty  a proper torch as well  lets see where we are  already converted just put on ice come on  lets go slowly  keep an eye out for trip systems  tannoy makes an announcement  just put them on dont show any emotion  no signs nothing ok  dont worry we can do it  we could die in there why you doing this  lets just say im doing it for my mum and dad  right lets go  tannoy chamber eight now open for human upgrading  chamber nine now open for human upgrading  chamber ten now open for human upgrading  chamber 11 now open for human upgrading  two guards we can take them  dont kill them who put you in charge  if you kill them whats the difference between you and a cyberman  well i suppose we could use these  smelling salts  bit stronger than that one of mrs moores little tricks  should knock em out  three two one  theres got to be more guards on board  then lets go get them  how did you get into this then  rattling along with the preachers  oh i used to be ordinary  worked at cybus industries nine to five  till one day i find something im not supposed to  a file on the mainframe  all i did was read it  then suddenly ive got men with guns knocking in the middle of the night  a life on the run  then i found the preachers  they needed a techie so i    just sat down and taught myself everything  what about mr moore  well hes not called moore  i got that from a book  mrs moore  its safer not to use real names  but he thinks im dead it was the only way to keep him safe  him and the kids  what about you  got any family  who needs family  ive got the whole world on my shoulders  go on then whats your real name  angela price  dont tell a soul  not a word  movement in deepcold six  awaken the army  doctor did that one move  its just the torchlight  keep going come on  theyre waking up run  get up quick theyre coming  open it open it  get up quick  quick angela come on  oh good team mrs moore  tannoy units upgraded now 6500  repeat 6500 and rising  you will wait  you ok  no  tannoy chamber six now open for human upgrading  all reject stock will be incinerated  any sign of jackie  you are peter tyler  confirm you are peter tyler  confirm  i recognise you i went first my name was jacqueline tyler  no what they are unprogrammed restrain  youre lying youre not her youre not my jackie  no i am cyberform  once i was jacqueline tyler  but you cant be  not her   her brain is inside this body  jacks i came to save you  this man worked with cybus industries to create our species  he will be rewarded by force  take them to cybercontrol  they killed her  they took her and killed her maybe theres a chance  i dont know maybe we can reverse it theres nothing we can do  but if she remembers    where is she which one was it which one was her  they all look the same  nice one nobodys home  find the controls what do they look like  they might have transmitter controls written in red letters just look  whoa cyberman  its dead  i dont think it was ever alive  its empty no brain just the robot suit its for display  transmitter  you are not upgraded  yeah well upgrade this  what the hell was that thing electromagnetic bomb  it takes out computers i figured it might stop a cybersuit  well you figured right now lets have a look  know your enemy theyve even got the logo on the front  lumics turned them into a brand  heart of steel  but look    is that flesh mmm  a central nervous system  artificially grown threaded through the suit so it responds like a living thing  well it is a living thing  oh but look  emotional inhibitor  stops them feeling anything  but why  its still got a human brain  imagine its reaction  if it could see itself realise itself inside this thing  it would go insane  so they cut out the one thing that makes them human  because they have to  why  am i  cold  oh my god its alive  it can feel we broke the inhibitor  im sorry im so sorry  why so cold  can you remember your name  sally sally phelan  youre a woman  wheres gareth  whos gareth  he cant see me  its unlucky the night before  youre getting married  im cold  im so cold  its all right you sleep now sally  just go to sleep  sally phelan didnt die for nothing  because thats the key  the emotional inhibitor  if we can find the cancellation code feed it throughout the system  into every cybermans head theyd realise what they are  and what happens then  i think it would kill them  can we do that  weve got to before they kill everyone else  theres no choice doctor  its got to be done  no no you didnt have to kill her  sensors detect a binary vascular system  you are an unknown upgrade  you will be taken for analysis  the transmitter controls are sealed behind here we need oxy acetylene  oh and i forgot to bring it with me then what do we do  we crash the zeppelin  with us inside it we could set it on automatic and then just leg it  lets have a look  its locked theres gotta be an override  let me have a go im good with computers trust me  ive been captured but dont worry rose and pete are still out there  they can rescue me never mind you ok  yeah  but they got jackie  we were too late lumic killed her  then where is he  the famous mr lumic  dont we get the chance to meet our lord and master  he has been upgraded  so hes just like you he is superior  the lumic unit has been designated cybercontroller  this is the age of steel  and i am its creator  im almost there  not bad work  its moving  you said it was dead  a robot suits still a good robot wait  hey cyberman over here  come on you brainless lump of metal come and have a go  oh no  they scream  the transmitters down  muffled screams  thats my friends at work good boys  mr lumic i think thats a vote for free will  i have factories waiting on seven continents  if the ear pods have failed then the cybermen will take humanity by force  london has fallen  so shall the world  hold on ive logged on to cybercontrol theyre alive the doctor and rose there they are  what the hell is that thing  shh has this thing got sound  i will bring peace to the world  everlasting peace    and unity and uniformity  and imagination what about that  the one thing that led you here imagination youre killing it dead  what is your name  im the doctor a redundant title  doctors need not exist  cybermen never sicken  yeah but thats it thats exactly the point  oh lumic youre a clever man  id call you a genius except im here everything youve invented  you did to fight your sickness brilliant  that is so human  but once you get rid of sickness and mortality then whats there to strive for eh  the cybermen wont advance  youll just stop  youll stay like this for ever  a metal earth with metal men and metal thoughts  lacking the one thing that makes this planet so alive people  ordinary stupid brilliant people  you are proud of your emotions  oh yes  then tell me doctor  have you known grief  and rage and pain  yes yes i have  and they hurt  oh yes  i can set you free  would you not want that  a life without pain  you might as well kill me  then i take that option  its not yours to take  youre a cybercontroller  you dont control me or anything with a heart  you have no means of stopping me  i have an army a species of my own  you just dont get it do you  an armys nothing  cos those ordinary people theyre the key the most ordinary person can change the world  some ordinary man or woman  some idiot all it takes is for him to find say the right numbers    say the right code say for example the code behind the emotional inhibitor  the code right in front of him cos even an idiot knows his computers these days  knows how to get past firewalls and passwords  how to find something encrypted in the lumic family database under what was it pete binary what  binary nine binary nine  an idiot could find that code  a cancellation code hed keep on typing keep on fighting anything to save his friends  your words are irrelevant  yeah talk too much thats my problem  lucky i got you that cheap tariff rose for all our chats  on your phone the phone  you will be deleted  yes delete control hash  then of course my particular favourite send  lets not forget how you seduced all those ordinary people  message alert by making technology compatible with everything else  its for you  like this  yes  im sorry  what have you done i gave them back their souls  they can see what youve done lumic  and its killing them delete delete delete  lumic groans  theres no way out  what are you doing if that factory blows this balloonll ignite take it back  mickey theyve had it i said take it back  were not leaving them behind  theres no way we are leaving them behind  hold it  rose can you hear me head for the roof  he says head for the roof  he groans  no  mickey where did you learn to fly that thing   playstation just hold on rose im coming to get you  you cant go any lower ive got to  youre gonna crush them  theres gotta be something theres got to be  oh yes  youve got to be kidding rose get on  hold on tight were going up  welcome to mickey smith airlines please enjoy your flight  we did it we did it  she shrieks  pete take this  use it  hold the button down and press it against the rope just do it  jackie tyler  this is for her  he screams  so what happens inside that thing then do you want to see  i dont think so  but you two all that stuff you said  about different worlds  who are you  its like you said  imagine there are different worlds  parallel worlds  worlds with another pete tyler  and jackie tyler still alive  and their daughter  ive got to go but if you just look inside    i cant theres all those lumic factories out there all those cybermen in
