or freaking out why should we here we go   electronic whooshing  ladies and gentlemen id like to announce weve just measured the ghost energy at 5000 gigawatts  give yourselves a round of applause  on todays ghostwatch claims that some of the ghosts  are starting to talk and there seems to be a regular formation  gathering around westminster bridge  its like a military display what the hells going on  and tonight were expecting very strong ghosts from london through the north and up into scotland  so basically eileen what you are telling me is that you are in love with a ghost  hes my ghost and i love him 24seven  well noone needs me any more  my ghost was pale and grey until i discoveredectoshine  et le president a dit aujourdhui que les fan  taj mahal jaane waale logon ko hoshiyaar kiya  nihonjin wa okashiku natte shimatta youdesu yurei wa daisuki  its all over the world  listen to me den watts  i dont care if you have come back from the grave  get out of my pub  the only spirits im serving in this place are gin whisky and vodka so you heard me get out  tv off but when did it start  well peggy heard this noise in the cellar so she goes down  no i mean worldwide  oh that was about two months ago  just happened woke up one morning and there they all were  ghosts everywhere  we all ran around screaming and that whole planet was panicking  no sign of you thank you very much but then it sort of sank in  took us time to realise that were lucky  what makes you think its grandad it just feels like him  theres that smell those old cigarettes cant you smell it  i wish i could mum but i cant  well youve got to make an effort youve got to want it sweetheart  and the more you want it the stronger it gets  sort of yeah  like a psychic link of course you want your old dad to be alive but youre wishing him into existence  the ghosts are using that to pull themselves in youre spoiling it  im sorry jackie but theres no smell theres no cigarettes  just the memory if theyre not ghosts what are they then  yeah but theyre human you can see them they look human  shes got a point i mean theyre all sort of blurred but theyre definitely people  maybe not  theyre pressing themselves into the surface of the world  but a footprint doesnt look like a boot  so what have we got any sign of that power loss  no problems mustve been a glitch  rajesh you got anything  its so busy down here im on sudoku book 509  well we just had a great ghost shift i know  but we had nothing  did they tell you  rd came up with a new spectrometer yesterday  barged in here all full of themselves  said they could detect the heat off a single protozoa through half a mile of steel  and what did they find  nothing it gave them nothing  same as ever  the machines keep saying that the sphere cant exist  but there it is  anything we can do  no im all right  its just  gets into your head this thing  like its staring at you  well catch up later thanks raj yeah  matt get on to

like tracing paper  youre always doing this reducing it to science why cant it be real  just think of it though  all the people weve lost our families coming back home  dont you think its beautiful  i think its horrific  rose give us a hand  soon as the cones activated if that line goes into the red press that button if it doesnt stop  setting 15b hold it against the port eight seconds and stop  if

into ghost shift  computer online  alarm buzzes  what have we got  somethings interfering with the ghost field   location  its close its within the city  dont like that much do you  who are you where are you coming from  ohh thats more like it not so friendly now are you  close it down close it down  computer offline  it was a very specific excitation of the ghost field  but that makes it easy to pinpoint  almost there  south london  southeast 15  its a council estate the powell estate  se15 7go  it was a public area  can we patch into the cctv network  doing it now  here we go weve got a camera within 50 yards  oh my god  is it him  its him  those ghosts are being forced into existence from one specific point  and i can track down the source allonsy  hes coming  rajesh its him  now weve got you  i like that allonsy i should say allonsy more often allonsy  look sharp rose tyler allonsy  it would be brilliant if i met someone called alonso  cos then i could say allonsy alonso every time youre staring at me  my mums still on board  if we end up on mars im gonna kill you  indistinct shouting  there goes the advantage of surprise  still cuts to the chase  stay in here look

moral high ground is mine  soldier hold it  oh  oh how marvellous  oh very good  superb happy day  um thanks  nice to meet you im the doctor  oh i should say hooray  you youve heard of me then  well of course we have and i have to say if it wasnt for you none of us would be here  the doctor and the tardis  and and and you are oh plenty of time for that  according to the records you dont travel alone  the doctor and his companion thats the pattern isnt that right  no point in hiding anything not from us so where is she  yes sorry good point shes just a bit shy thats all  but here she is  rose tyler  shes not the best ive ever had  bit too blonde not too steady on her pins lot of that  and just last week she stared into the heart of the time vortex  and aged 57 years but shell do  im 40 deluded bless  ill have to trade her in dyou need anyone shes very good at tea  well i say very good i mean not bad  well i say not bad anyway lead on allonsy  but not too fast her ankles going  ill show you where my ankles going  it was only a matter of time until you found us  and at last youve made it  id like to welcome you doctor  welcome to torchwood  thats a jathaa sun glider  came down to earth off the shetland islands ten years ago  what did it crash no we shot it down  they violated our earthspace then we stripped it bare  the weapon that destroyed the sycorax on christmas day  that was us now if youd like to come with me  the torchwood institute has a motto  if its alien its ours  anything that comes from the sky we strip it down and we use it for the good of the british empire  the good of the what the british empire there isnt a british empire  not yet excuse me now if you wouldnt mind  dyou recognise this doctor thats a particle gun  good isnt it took us eight years to get it to work  its the 21st century you cant have particle guns  we must defend our border against the alien thank you sebastian isnt it yes maam  thank you its very important to know everyone by name  torchwood is a very modern organisation  people skills thats what its all about these days im a people person  have you got anyone called alonso i dont think so is that important  i spose not what was your name  yvonne yvonne hartman  ah yes now were rather fond of these  the magnaclamp found in a spaceship buried at the base of mount snowdon  attach this to an object and it cancels the mass  i could use it to lift two tons of weight with a single hand  thats an imperial ton by the way torchwood refuses to go metric  i could do with that to carry the shopping  all these devices are for torchwoods benefit not the general publics  so what about these ghosts  ah yes the ghosts theyre what you might call a side effect  of what all in good time doctor there is an itinerary trust me  oi where are you taking that  if its alien its ours youll never get inside it etcetera  psychic paper psychic paper  he mouths  but all the times ive been on earth ive never heard of you  well of course not youre the enemy  youre actually named in the torchwood foundation charter of  that house in scotland  right where you encountered queen victoria and the werewolf  i think he makes half of it up  her majesty created the torchwood institute for the express intention of keeping britain great  and fighting the alien horde  but if im the enemy does that mean im a prisoner oh yes  but well make you perfectly comfortable and there is so much you can teach us  starting with this  now what dyou make of that  you must be the doctor  rajesh singh its an honour sir yeah  what is that thing weve got no idea  whats wrong with it  what makes you think theres something wrong with it i dunno  it feels weird the sphere has that effect on everyone  makes you want to run and hide  like its forbidden  weve tried analysing it using every device imaginable  but according to our instruments the sphere doesnt exist  it weighs nothing it doesnt age  no heat no radiation  and has no atomic mass  but i can see it  fascinating isnt it it upsets people because it gives off nothing  it is absent  well doctor  this is a void ship  and what is that  well its impossible for starters  i always thought it was just a theory but  its a vessel designed to exist outside time and space  travelling through the void  and whats the void  the space between dimensions theres all sorts of realities around us different dimensions  billions of parallel universes all stacked up against each other the void is the space in between  containing absolutely nothing  can you imagine that nothing  no light no dark no up no down  no life no time  without end  my people called it the void the eternals called it the howling  but some people call it hell  but someone built the sphere what for why go there  to explore  to escape  you could sit inside it and eternity would pass you by the big bang  the end of the universe start of the next wouldnt even touch the sides  youd exist outside the whole of creation  you see we were right there is something inside it  oh yes  so how do we get in there we dont  we send it back into hell how did it get here in the first place  the sphere came through into this world  and the ghosts followed in its wake show me  no doctor  i dont get it what is it what am i supposed to be looking for  just go to the left  yvonnes gonna be back any minute  just go to the left  what dyou mean in here  matt screams  the sphere came through here   a hole in the world  not active at the moment but when we fire particle engines at that exact spot the breach opens up  how did you even find it wed been getting warning signs for years a radar black spot  so we built this place the torchwood tower  the breach was 600ft above sea level it was the only way to reach it  you built a skyscraper just to reach a spatial disturbance how much money have you got  enough  hold on a minute were in canary wharf must be  this building its canary wharf  that is the public name for it  to those in the know its torchwood so you find the breach probe it  the sphere comes through  it leaves a hole in the fabric of reality and that hole you think ooh shall we leave it alone  shall we back off shall we play it safe no you think lets make it bigger  its a massive source of energy  if we can harness that power we need never depend on the middle east again  britain will become truly independent  but you can see for yourself the next ghost shifts in two minutes  cancel it i dont think so im warning you cancel it  exactly as the legends would have it  the doctor assuming alien authority over the rights of man  let me show you sphere comes through  but when it made the hole it cracked the world around it  the entire surface of this dimension splintered  and thats how the ghosts get through theyre bleeding through the fault lines  walking from their world across the void and into yours  with the human race hoping and wishing and helping them along but too many ghosts and  well in that case well have to be more careful  positions ghost shift in one minute  miss hartman please dont do it  we have done this a thousand times  then stop at a thousand were in control of the ghosts  the levers can open the breach but equally they can close it  ok  sorry never mind as you were what is that it  no fair enough ive said my bit dont mind me  any chance of a cup of tea  ghost shift in 20 seconds  cant wait to see it you cant stop us doctor  absolutely not pull up a chair rose come and watch the fireworks  ghost shift in ten seconds  nine eight seven  six five four three two  stop the shift i said stop  thank you i suppose it makes sense  to get as much intelligence as possible  but the programme will recommence as soon as youve explained everything  im glad to be of help and someone clear up this glass  they did warn me doctor they said you liked to make a mess  come on  can i help you i wasjust  try not to look it does that to everyone  what do you want sorry um  they sent me from personnel  they said some man had been taken prisoner some sort of doctor  im just checking the lines of communication  did they tell you anything can i see your authorisation  sure  well thats lucky  everyone in torchwood has at least a basic level of psychic training  this paper is blank and youre a fake  seal the room and call security  samuel  can you check the door locks she walked right in  doing it now sir  well if youd like to take a seat  so these ghosts whatever they are did they build the sphere  must have aimed it at this dimension like a cannonball  yvonne i think you should see this  weve got a visitor i dont know who she is  but funnily enough she arrived at the same time as the doctor  is she one of yours  never seen her before in my life  good then we can have her shot  oh all right then it was worth a try  thats thats rose tyler  sorry  hello  well if thats rose tyler whos she  im her mother oh you travel with her mother  he kidnapped me when torchwood comes to write my complete history  dont tell people that i time travelled with her mother oh charming  ive got a reputation to uphold excuse me everyone  i thought i said stop the ghost shift  who started the programme i ordered you to stop  whos doing that right step away from your monitors everyone  gareth adi stop what youre doing right now  matt step away from your desk thats an order  stop the levers andrew stop the levers whats she doing  adi step away from the desk  listen to me step away from the desk she cant hear you  theyre overriding the system  were going into ghost shift  yvonne i thought you said the next ghost shift was cancelled  whats going on yvonne  it cant be  its active its the earpiece controlling them  ive seen this before  im sorry im so sorry  they yell  what happened what did you just do  theyre dead you killed them  someone else did that but you killed them i havent got time for this  what are these earpieces dont how does it control them trust me leave them alone  but what are they  ugh oh god  it goes inside their brain  what about the ghost shift cant you stop it  theyre still controlling it theyve hijacked the system whos they  might be a remote transmitter but its got to be close by i can trace it jackie stay here  keep those levers down keep them offline  weve got a problem down here yvonne can you hear me yvonne for gods sake  the sphere is active the readings are going wild  its got weight its got mass and an electromagnetic field it exists  banging  the doors sealed automatic quarantine we cant get out  its ok weve beaten them before we can beat them again that why im here the fight goes on  the fight against what  what dyou think  you two you come with us this way  whats down here  i dont know i think its building work its just renovations  you should go back think again  what is it  whats down here  earpieces ear pods this world is colliding with another  and i think i know which one  what are they they came through first  the advance guard  cybermen oh  we had them beaten but then they escaped  the cybermen just vanished  they found their way through to this world but so did we  the doctor said that was impossible  yeah its not the first time hes been wrong whats inside that sphere  noone knows cyber leader cyber king emperor of the cybermen  whatever it is hes dead meat  its good to see you  yeah its good to see you too  get away from the machines do what they say dont fight them  dont shoot  arrgh aharrgh  what are they  we are the cybermen  the ghost shift will be increased to 100  computer online  here come the ghosts  its extraordinary  there are more ghosts then weve ever seen before and its happening all over the world  as far as we know the increase in ghost activity is harmless  marching  can anyone hear me  come on i need help down here  i need  screeching banging  here we go  but these cybermen what have they got to do with the ghosts  dont you listen a footprint doesnt look like a boot  achieving full transfer  theyre cybermen  all the ghosts are cybermen millions of them  right across the world  people scream  theyre not ghosts theyre metal men arrrgh  i urge you stay in your homes  they scream  theyre invading the whole planet  its not an invasion its too late for that  its a victory  computer theyre activated  theyre activated theyre activated  theyre activated  i know whats in there and im ready for them ive got just the thing  this is gonna blast them to hell samuel what are you doing  the names mickey  mickey smith defending the earth  the cybermen dont have the technology to build a void ship its way beyond you  how did you create that sphere the sphere is not ours  what  the sphere broke down the barriers between worlds we only followed  its origin is unknown  then whats inside it rose is down there  thats not cybermen  oh my god  dalek location earth life forms detected  exterminate exterminate
