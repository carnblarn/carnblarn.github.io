calling it a mermaid  now someones taken a pig opened up its brain stuck bits on  then they strapped it in that ship made it divebomb  it mustve been terrified  theyve taken this animal and turned it

way to invade putting the world on red alert good point so what they up to   crisis continues the government shows remarkable lack of leadership paranoia sweeps the country  thereve been at least three reports of public assaults on people possibly identified as aliens  now back to tom hitchinson  are there more ships to come  and whats their intention  the authorities are now asking if anyone knows anything  if any previous sighting has been made then call this number  we need your help  engaged tone  engaged tone  yes ive seen one i really have an alien and shes with him  my daughter shes with him and shes not safe oh my god shes not safe  ive seen an alien and i know his name hes called the doctor  its a box a blue box she called it a tardis  so what you doing down there ricky

thats the spaceship on its way to earth see  except hold on    see the spaceship did a slingshot round the earth before it landed  whats that mean it came from earth in the first place went up and came back down whoever those aliens are  theyve been here a while question is whatve they been doing  what dyou think hows the compression i think ive got too much ballast round the middle  phrrrt ooh thats better  we must fix the gas exchange its getting ridiculous oh seems human to me   better get rid of his skin  shame i quite enjoyed being oliver  he had a wife a mistress and a young farmer  he chuckles  god i was busy  back to work  i have an army to command careful now were not there yet  general asquith sir weve had a priority alarm its code nine confirmed code nine  right good code nine  which would mean     in the event of emergency protocols being activated  our software automatically searches all communications for keywords and one of those words is doctor  i think weve found him
