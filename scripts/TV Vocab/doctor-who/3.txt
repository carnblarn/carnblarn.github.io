the knocker  on the door of this house but let any man explain to me  if he can how it happened that scrooge having his key in the lock of the door  saw in the knocker without its undergoing any intermediate process of change  not a knocker but marleys face  murmurs of surprise  marleys face  it looked at scrooge  as marley used to look  it looked like  oh my lord  it looked like that  some ladies gasp  what phantasmagoria is this  ethereal groan followed by shrieks  thats more like it  highpitched scream  stay in your seats i i beg you  it is a lantern show trickery  there she is sir  i

trains the signalman  terrifying  the best short story ever written  youre a genius do you want me to get rid of him sir  er no i think he can stay  honestly charles er can i call you charles im such a big fan  eh youre a what a big what fan number one fan thats me  how exactly are you a fan  in what way do you resemble a means of keeping oneself cool  no it means fanatic mind you that american bit in martin chuzzlewit whats that about  was that just padding or what its rubbish i thought you were my fan  oh well if you cant take criticism  do the death of little nell it cracks me up no sorry  forget about that come on faster  who exactly is in that hearse  my friend shes only 19 and its my fault shes in my care now shes in danger  why are we wasting my time talking about dry old books  this is much more important driver  be swift the chase is on yes sir  attaboy charlie nobody calls me charlie  the ladies do how do you know that i told you im your number one  number one fan  the poor girls still alive sir what are we going to do with her  i dont know  i didnt plan any of this did i  is it my fault if the dead wont stay dead  then whose fault is it sir  why is this happening to us  i did the bishop a favour once  made his nephew look like a cherub even though hed been a fortnight in the weir  hey perhaps hell do us an exorcism on the cheap  knock at door  say im not in tell em were closed  just just get rid of em  ghostly sighs and whisperings  im sorry sir were closed nonsense since when did an undertaker keep office hours  the dead dont die on schedule i demand to see your master  hes not in sir  dont lie to me child summon the master  im awfully sorry mr dickens but the master is indisposed  having trouble with your gas  what the shakespeare is going on  are you all right  youre kidding me yeah youre just kidding  you are kidding me arent you  ok not kidding  youre not allowed inside sir theres something inside the walls  the gas pipes  somethings living inside the gas  let me out open the door  thats her please let me out  how dare you sir this is my house  i told you let me out somebody open the door  open the door  i think this is my dance  its a prank must be were under some mesmeric influence  no the dead are walking  hi hi whos your friend  charles dickens  ok my names the doctor who are you then what do you want  failing open the rift were dying  trapped in this form  cannot sustain help us  it screams  first you drug me then you kidnap me and dont think i didnt feel your hands  having a wander you dirty old man i wont be spoken to like this  then you sent me in a room full of zombies  and if that aint enough you swan off and leave me to die so come on talk  its not my fault its this house  it always had a reputation  haunted  but i never had much bother until about three months back and then the stiffs  the erm  the dear departed started getting restless  tommyrot  you witnessed it  cant keep the beggars down sir  they walk  and its the queerest thing but they hang onto scraps  two sugars sir just how you like it  one old fella used to be a sexton almost walked into his own memorial service  just like the old lady going to your performance sir just as shed planned  morbid fancy  oh charles you were there i saw nothing but an illusion  if youre going to deny it dont waste my time just shut up  what about the gas thats new sir i never seen anything like that  means its getting stronger the rifts getting wider and somethings sneaking through  whats the rift a weak point in time and space  a connection between this place and another  thats the cause of ghost stories most of the time  thats how i got the house so cheap stories going back generations  echoes in the dark queer songs in the air  and this feeling like a shadow  passing over your soul  mind you truth be told its been good for business  just what people expect from a gloomy old trade like mine  faint ghostly whispers  impossible  checking for strings  wires perhaps  there must be some mechanism behind this fraud  oh come on charles  all right i shouldnt have told you to shut up im sorry  but youve got one of the best minds in the world and you saw those gas creatures i cannot accept that  and what does the human body do when it decomposes it breaks down produces gas  perfect home for these gasthings they can slip inside use it as a vehicle  just like your driver and his coach stop it  can it be that i have the world entirely wrong  not wrong theres just more to learn  ive always railed against the fantasists  oh i loved an illusion  revelled in them but thats exactly what they were illusions  the real world is something else  i dedicated myself to that  injustices  the great social causes  i hoped that i was a force for good  now you tell me that the real world  is a realm of spectres and jack olanterns  in which case  have i wasted my brief span here doctor  has it all been for nothing  please miss you shouldnt be helping its not right  dont be daft i bet sneed works you to death  how much do you get paid  eight pound a year miss how much i know  i wouldve been happy with six  so did you even go to school or what  of course i did what do you think i am an urchin  i went every sunday nice and proper  what once a week  we did sums and everything  to be honest  i hated every second me too  dont tell anyone  but one week i didnt go and i ran down the heath all on my own  i did plenty of that i used to go round the shops with my mate shareen  and we used to go and look at boys  well i dont know much about that miss  oh come on times havent changed that much  i bet youve done the same i dont think so miss  gwyneth you can tell me  i bet youve got your eye on someone  i suppose there is one lad  the butchers boy he comes by every tuesday  such a lovely smile on him  i like a nice smile  good smile nice bum  well i have never heard the like  ask him out give him a cup of tea or something thats a start  i swear its the strangest thing miss  youve got all the clothes and the breeding but you talk like some sort of wild thing  maybe i am  maybe thats a good thing  you need a bit more in your life than mr sneed  oh now thats not fair  hes not so bad old sneed  he was very kind to me to take me in cos i lost my mam and dad to the flu when i was 12  oh im sorry  thank you miss but ill be with them again one day  sitting with them in paradise  i shall be so blessed  theyre waiting for me  maybe your dads up there waiting for you too miss  maybe  um who told you he was dead  i dunno mustve been the doctor  my father died years back  youve been thinking about him lately more than ever  suppose so  how do you know all this  mr sneed says i think too much  im all alone down here  i bet youve got dozens of servants  no no servants where im from  and youve come such a long way  what makes you think so  youre from london  ive seen london in drawings but never like that  all those people rushing about  halfnaked for shame  and the noise  and the metal boxes racing past  and the birds in the sky no no theyre metal as well  metal birds with people in them  people are flying  and you youve flown so far  further than anyone  the things youve seen  the darkness  the big bad wolf  im sorry im sorry miss its all right i cant help it  ever since i was a little girl my mam said i had the sight  she told me to hide it but its getting stronger  more powerful is that right  all the time sir  every night  voices in my head  you grew up on top of the rift youre part of it  youre the key ive tried to make sense of it sir  consulted with  spiritualists tablerappers all sorts well that should help  you can show us what to do  what to do where sir  were going to have a seance  this is how madame mortlock summons those from the land of mists down in butetown  come we must all join hands i cant take part in this  humbug come on open mind  this is precisely the sort of cheap mummery i strive to unmask  seances  nothing but luminous tambourines and a squeezebox concealed between the knees this girl knows nothing  now dont antagonise her  i love a happy medium  i cant believe you just said that  come on we might need you  good man  now gwyneth  reach out  speak to us  are you there  spirits come  speak to us that we may relieve your burden  distant distorted voices  can you hear that  nothing can happen this is sheer folly look at her  i see them  i feel them  whats it saying it cant get through the rift  gwyneth its not controlling you youre controlling it  now look deep allow them through i cant  yes you can just believe it i have faith in you gwyneth  make the link  yes  great god  spirits from the other side  the other side of the universe  pity us  pity the gelth  there is so little time help us  what do you want us to do the rift  take the girl to the rift  make the bridge what for  we are so very few  the last of our kind  we face extinction why what happened  once we had a physical form like you  but then the war came   war what war  the time war  the whole universe convulsed  the time war raged invisible to smaller species but devastating to higher forms  our bodies wasted away  were trapped in this gaseous state  so thats why you need the corpses  we want to stand tall  to feel the sunlight  to live again  we need a physical form and your dead are abandoned  they go to waste give them to us  but we cant why not  its not i mean  its not not decent not polite it could save their lives  open the rift  let the gelth through  were dying help us  pity the gelth  gwyneth  all true  its all true  its all right you just sleep  but my angels miss  they came didnt they they need me  yes gwyneth youre their only chance of survival  i told you leave her alone  shes exhausted and shes not fighting your battles  now drink this  but what did you say doctor explain it again  what are they aliens  like foreigners you mean  pretty foreign yeah from up there  brecon close and theyve been trying to get through from brecon to cardiff but the roads blocked  only a few can get through even then theyre weak they can only testdrive the bodies for so long  then they have to revert to gas and hide in the pipes  which is why they need the girl  theyre not having her but she can help  living on the rift shes become part of it she can open it up make a bridge and let them through  incredible ghosts that are not ghosts but beings from another world  who can only exist in our realm by inhabiting cadavers  good system it might work  you cant let them run around inside of dead people  why not its like recycling  seriously though you cant seriously though i can  but its just wrong  those bodies were living people we should respect them even in death  do you carry a donor card  its different thats it is different yeah  its a different morality get used to it or go home  you heard what they said times short  i cant worry about a few corpses when the last of the gelth could be dying  i dont care theyre not using her dont i get a say miss  well yes no  you dont understand whats going on you would say that miss cos thats very clear inside your head  that you think im stupid thats not fair its true though  things might be very different where youre from but here and now i know my own mind  and the angels need me  doctor what do i have to do  you dont have to do anything theyve been singing to me since i was a child  sent by my mam on holy mission  so tell me  we need to find the rift  this house is on a weakspot so there must be a spot thats weaker than any other  mr sneed whats the weakest part of this house  the place where most of the ghosts have been seen  that would be the morgue  no chance you were going to say gazebo is there  huh  talk about bleak house  the thing is doctor the gelth dont succeed cos i know they dont  i know for a fact that corpses werent walking round in 1869  times in flux changing every second your cosy little world could be rewritten like that  nothing is safe remember that  nothing doctor i think the room is getting colder  here they come youve come to help  praise the doctor praise him  promise you wont hurt her  hurry please so little time pity the gelth  ill take you somewhere else after the transfer  somewhere you can build proper bodies  this isnt a permanent solution all right  my angels i can help them live  ok wheres the weak point here beneath the arch  beneath the arch  you dont have to do this  my angels establish the bridge reach out to the void let us through  yes  i can see you  i can see you come  bridgehead establishing come to me  come to this world poor lost souls  it has begun the bridge is made  she has given herself to the gelth  rather a lot of them eh  the bridge is open we descend  the gelth will come through in force  you said that you were few in number  a few billion and all of us in need of corpses  now gwyneth  stop this  listen to your master  this has gone far enough stop dabbling child and leave these things alone i beg of you  mr sneed get back dont go near  i think its going a little bit wrong  i have joined the legions of the gelth   come march with us  oh glory  we need bodies all of you dead  the human race dead  gwyneth stop them send them back now  three more bodies convert them  make them vessels for the gelth  doctor i cant im sorry  this new world of yours its too much for me  im so  give yourself to glory  sacrifice your lives to the gelth  i trusted you i pitied you  we dont want your pity we want this world and all its flesh  not while im alive  then live no more  but i cant die tell me i cant  i havent even been born yet its impossible for me to die  isnt it  im sorry  failing atmosphere hostile  gas  the gas  but its 1869 how can i die now  time isnt a straight line it can twist into any shape  you can be born in the 20th century and die in the 19th  and its all my fault  i brought you here  its not your fault  i wanted to come what about me  i saw the fall of troy world war five  i pushed boxes at the boston tea party  now im gonna die in a dungeon  in cardiff  and its not just dying  were gonna become one of them  well go down fighting yeah  yeah together yeah  im so glad i met you  me too  doctor doctor  turn off the flame turn up the gas now fill the room all of it now  what are you doing turn it all on  flood the place  brilliant gas what so we choke to death instead  am i correct doctor  these creatures are gaseous  fill the room with gas itll draw them out of the host suck them into the air like poison from a wound  i hope  oh lord  i hope that this theory will be validated soon  if not immediately  plenty more  its working  gwyneth send them back they lied theyre not angels  liars look at them  if your mother and father could look down and see this theyd tell you the same  theyd give you the strength now send them back  cant breathe charles get her out  im not leaving her theyre too strong  remember that world you saw  roses world all those people  none of it will exist unless you send them back through the rift  i cant send them back  but i can hold them  hold them in this place hold them here  get out  you cant leave this place  rose get out go now  i wont leave her while shes still in danger now go  come on leave that to me  im sorry  thank you  she didnt make it  im sorry she closed the rift  at such a cost  the poor child  i did try rose but gwyneth was already dead  she had been for at least five minutes what do you mean  i think she was dead from the minute she stood in that arch  but she cant have she spoke to us she helped us she saved us  how could she have done that  there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy  even for you doctor  she saved the world  a servant girl  and noone will ever know  right then charlie boy ive just got to go into my erm  shed  wont be long
