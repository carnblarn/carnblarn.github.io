and military protocols sir generation 5000 soldier im ready  did you say daughter mmm technically technically how  progenation reproduction from a single organism  you take a sample of diploid cells split them into haploids  then recombine them in a different arrangementand grow  very quickly apparently somethings coming  its the hath get down  we have to blow the tunnel get the detonator  im not detonating anything  blow the thing martha no dont  youve sealed off the tunnel why did you do that they were trying to kill us  but theyve got my friend collateral damage  at least youve still got

two three  now then im doctor martha jones  who the hell are you  im donna whats your name  dont know its not been assigned  well if you dont know that what do you know how to fight  nothing else the machine must embed military history and tactics  but no name shes a generated anomaly  generated anomaly jennyrated  well what about that jenny  jenny yeah i like that jenny  what dyou think dad good as anything i suppose  not what youd call a natural parent are you they stole a tissue sample at gunpoint and processed it  its not what id call natural parenting rubbish  you cant extrapolate a relationship from a biological accident er child support agency can  just because i share physiological traits with simian primates doesnt make me a monkeys uncle does it  im not a monkey  or a child  so where are we what planets this messaline well whats left of it   generation 6671 extinct  generation 6672  46 deceased generation 6680  14 deceased  butthis is a theatre maybe theyre doing miss saigon  its like a town or a city  but why general cobb i presume  found in the western tunnels im told with no marks  there was an outbreak of pacifism in the eastern zone three generations back before we lost contact  is that where you came from eastern zone yeah im the doctor this is donna and im jenny  dont think you can infect us with your peacemaking  were committed to the fight  i cant stay anyway gotta go and find my friend  thats not possible all movement is regulated were at war  yes i noticed with the hath  but tell me cos we got a bit out of circulation eastern zone and all that sowho exactly are the hath  back at the dawn of this planet these ancient halls were carved from the earth  our ancestors dreamt of a new beginning a colony where human and hath would work and live together  so what happened the dream died  broken along with hath promises  they wanted it all for themselves but the early pioneers fought back  they used the machines to produce soldiers instead of colonists and began this battle for survival  theres nothing but earth outside whys that why build underground  the surface is too dangerous  then why build windows and what does this mean  the rites and symbols of our ancestors the meaningslost in time  how longs this war gone on for longer than anyone can remember  countless generations marked only by the dead  what fighting all this time because we must  every child of the machine is born with this knowledge  its our inheritance its all we know  how to fight and how to die  right  so were here  does this show the entire city including the hath zones yes why  well itll help us find martha weve more important things to do  the progenation machines are powered down but we could breed a whole platoon from you two  im not having sons and daughters by some great big machine sorry no offence but youre not real  youre no better than him i have a body i have a mind  i have independent thought how am i not real  what makes you better than me  well said we need more like you if ever were to find the source  ooh the source whats that then i like a source what is it  the breath of life and that would be  in the beginning the great one breathed life into the universe  then she looked at what shed done and she sighed she i like that  right so its a creation myth its not myth its real that sigh  it was caught and kept as the source  it was lost when the war started but its here somewhere  whoever holds the source controls the destiny of this planet ah  i thought so theres a suppressed layer of information in this map  if i can just  what is it see a whole complex of tunnels hidden from sight  hold on look  that must be the lost temple the source will be inside  youve shown us the way and were closer than the hath its ours  thats a new map theres a different set of tunnels  tell them to prepare to move out well progenate new soldiers on the morning shift then we march  once we reach the temple peace will be restored at long last  if you really wanted peace couldnt you just stop fighting only when we have the source  itll give us the power to erase every stinking hath from the face of this planet  a second ago it was peace in our time now youre talking genocide  for us that means the same thing then you need a better dictionary  look up genocide youll see a picture of me there and the caption will read over my dead body  youre the one who showed us the path to victory  but you can consider the irony from your prison cell  cline at arms oi oi all right cool the beans rambo take them  and if you try anything doctor ill see that your woman dies first  i am not his woman wwere not a couple  come on this way im going to stop you cobb  i have an army and the breath of god on my side whatll you have this  lock them up what about the new soldier cant trust her shes from pacifist stock take them all  but i didnt do anything  i think i just started a war  more numbers theyve gotta mean something  makes as much sense as the breath of life story  you mean thats not true  no its a myth isnt it doctor  yes but there could be something real in that temple something thats become a myth a weapon  so the source could be a weapon and weve given directions to captain nutjob oh yes not good is it  we need to get out of here find martha and stop cobb from slaughtering the hath  what what are you what are you staring at  you keep insisting youre not a soldier  but look at you drawing up strategies like a proper general  no im trying to stop the fighting isnt every soldier well i suppose butthatsthats  donna give me your phone time for an upgrade  youve got a weapon its not a weapon youre using it to fight back  im gonna learn so much from you you are such a soldier donna will you tell her  oh you are speechless im loving this you keep on jenny  doctor martha youre alive oh am i glad to hear your voice are you all right  im with donna were fine what about you  and jenny shes fine too yes all right and jenny  thats the woman from the machine the soldier my daughter except she isnt anyway where are you  im in the hath camp im ok but somethings going on  the hath are marching off to some place that appeared on this map  ohhh that was me if both armies are heading that way theres going to be a bloodbath  what do you want me to do just stay where you are  but i can help phone beeps doctor doctor  the doors that have been closed will be open to us now  the door to the temple to the source and to victory  come the dawn cycle we march chanting  theyre getting ready to move out we have to get past that guard  i can deal with him no no youre not going anywhere what  you belong here with them she belongs with us with you shes your daughter  shes a soldier she came out of that machine i know have you got that stethoscope  give it to me  come on  whatre you doing its all right just hold still  come here listen  and then tell me where she belongs  two hearts exactly whats going on does that mean shes a  what do you call a female time lord whats a time lord its who i am  its where im from and im from you youre an echo thats all a time lord is so much more  a sum of knowledge a code a shared history a shared suffering  only its gone now all of it  gone forever  what happened  there was a war like this one  and you fought  and killed  yes  then how are we different  i need to charge it up i need power dyou understand  theres even more in 3d oh youre a clever hath  so this is where everybodys headed  but look those tunnels sort of zigzag  if i went up and over the surface in a straight line id get there first  why not  are these the readings for the surface it doesnt look too bad  nitrogen and oxygen about 8020  thats fine ozone levels are high  and some big radiation spikes  but as long as im not out there too long  i have to find my friends  come on then  hey  im not supposed to talk to you im on duty i know  guarding me  so does that mean im dangerous  or that i need protecting  protecting from what  oh i dont know men like you  keep quiet and open the door  id like to see you try that  let me distract this one  i have picked up a few womanly wiles over the years  lets save your wiles for later  in case of emergency  i was gonna distract him not clobber him well it worked  they must all have a copy of that new map just stay there dont hurt anyone  you can stay down here and live your whole life in the shadows  its up to you but nothings gonna stop me  i knew you couldnt resist it  er language come on  it was the girl she tricked me they got away im sorry  i waited all my life for this moment noone is going to get in my way certainly not this doctor  at arms we march to war  wait  the hidden tunnel  there must be a control panel  its another one of those numbers theyre everywhere  the original builders mustve left them some old cataloguing system  you got a pen bit of paper  cos dyou see the numbers are counting down  this one ends in 14  the prison cell said 16  always thinking both of you who are you people i told you  im the doctor the doctor  thats it thats all he ever says  no  oh come off it youre the most anomalous bloke ive ever met  here it is and time lords what are they for exactly for  theyre not theyre not for anything  so what do you do i travel  through time and space  he saves planets  rescues civilisations  defeats terrible creatures  and runs a lot  seriously theres an outrageous amount of running involved  got it  squad 5 with me  now what were you saying about running  thats not mood lighting is it  no i didnt think so  arming device  theres more of these  always eight numbers counting down the closer we get  here we go  you better be quick the general  where are you going i can hold them up no we dont need any more dead  its them or us it doesnt mean you have to kill them  but im trying to save your life  listen to me the killing  after a while it infects you  and once it does youre never rid of it  but we dont have a choice we always have a choice  im sorry jenny  this door now  there she is  i told you nothing but a soldier shes trying to help  jenny come on im coming  ceasefire ceasefire  thats it jenny leave it lets go  youre a child of the machine  youre on my side  join us  join us in the war against the hath  its in your blood girl dont deny it  jenny come on  thats it hurry up  no no no no the circuits looped back  zap it back again the controls are back there  theyre coming wait jjust  there isnt jenny i cant  ill have to manage on my own  watch and learn father  no way  that was impossible not impossible  just a bit unlikely brilliant  you were brilliant brilliant  i didnt kill general cobb i could have but i didnt  you were right i had a choice  spread out  i warned you cobb  if the source is a weapon im gonna make sure you never use it  one of us is gonna die today and it wont be me  it cant be much further  help me  im sinking im sinking help me  peck help me  help me peck im sinking  its no good aah  aah  noooo  noooo  so you travel together but youre not together  what no no no way  no no were friends thats all  were not even the same species  and whats it like the travelling  never a dull moment  can be terrifying brilliant and funny   sometimes all at the same time  ive seen some amazing things though whole new worlds  oh id love to see new worlds  you will wont she doctor  hm  do you think jennyll see any new worlds  i suppose so  you mean  you mean youll take me with you we cant leave you here can we  thank you thank you thank you  come on lets get a move on careful there might be traps  kids they never listen  oh i know that look see it a lot round our way  blokes with pushchairs and frowns youve got dadshock  dadshock sudden unexpected fatherhood  take a bit of getting used to no its not that  well what is it then having jenny in the tardis is that it  whats she gonna do cramp your style  like youve got a sports car and shell turn it into a peoplecarrier  donna ive been a father before what  i lost all that a long time ago  along with everything else  im sorry i didnt know  why didnt you tell me  you talk all the time but you dont say anything  i know im just  when i look at her now i can see them  the hole they left all the pain that filled it  i just dont know if i can face that every day  it wont stay like that  shell help you  we both will  but when they died that part of me died with them  itll never come back not now  i tell you something doctor  something ive never told you before  i think youre wrong  theyve blasted through the beams time to run again love the running  yeah love the running  were trapped cant be this must be the temple  this is a door  and again  were down to 12 now ive got it  i can hear them nearly done  these cant be a cataloguing system theyre getting closer get back  theyre too similar too familiar not yet now  got it  theyre coming  close the door  that was close no fun otherwise  its not what id call a temple  it looks more like fusiondrive transport  its a spaceship  the original one the one the first colonists arrived in  could be but the power cells would have run down after all that time  this ones still poweredup and functioning come on  its the hath that doors not gonna last much longer  if general cobb gets through down there wars gonna break out  look look look look look  ships log  first wave of human  hath cocolonisation of messaline  it is the original ship what happened  phase one construction they used robot drones to build the city  but does it mention the war final entry  mission commander dead  still no agreement on who should assume leadership  hath and humans divided into factions that must be it  a power vacuum  the crew divided into two factions and turned on each other  start using the progenation machines  and youve got two armies fighting a neverending war  two armies who are now both outside look at that  its like the numbers in the tunnels  no no no no but listen  i spent six months working as a temp in hounslow library  and i mastered the dewey decimal system in two days flat  im good with numbers  its staring us in the face what is  its the date  assuming the first two numbers are some big old space date  then youve got year month day  its the other way round like it is in america ohhh  its the new byzantine calendar  the codes are completion dates for each section  they finish it they stamp the date on  so the numbers arent counting down  theyre going out from here day by day  as the city got built  yes oh good work donna  yeah but youre still not getting it  the first number i saw back there was 60120717  well look at the date today   what does it mean seven days thats it  seven days just seven days  what dyou mean seven days seven days since war broke out  this war started seven days ago  just a week a week  they said years no they said generations  if theyre all like you products of those machines  they could have 20 generations in a day  each generation gets killed passes on the legend  ohhh donna youre a genius  all the buildings theyre in ruins  theyre not ruined theyre just empty  waiting to be populated  ohh theyve mythologised their entire history  the source must be part of that too  doctor martha  i shouldve known you wouldnt stay away from the excitement  donna oooh youre filthy what happened  i erm took the surface route  thats the general we havent much time  we dont know what were looking for is it me or can you smell flowers  yes  bougainvillea  i say we follow our nose  general blocks 7 to 10 advance  with me  oh yes  yes  isnt this brilliant  is that the source  its beautiful  what is it  terraforming  its a third generation terraforming device  so why are we suddenly in kew gardens  because thats what it does all this only bigger  much bigger its in a transit state  producing this must help keep it stable before they finally  stop hold your fire  what is this some kind of trap  i want this war won  you cant win noone can you dont even know why youre here  your whole history its just chinese whispers  getting more distorted the more its passed on  this is the source  this is what youre fighting over  a device to rejuvenate a planets ecosystem its nothing mystical  its from a laboratory not some creator  its a bubble of gases  a cocktail of stuff for accelerated evolution  methane hydrogen ammonia amino acids proteins nucleic acids  its used to make barren planets habitable  look around you  its not for killing  its bringing life  if you allow it it can lift you out of these dark tunnels  and into the bright bright sunlight  no more fighting  no more killing  im the doctor  and i declare this war is over  whats happening  the gases will escape and trigger the terraforming process  what does that mean it means a new world  no  jenny jenny talk to me jenny  is she gonna be all right  a new world  its beautiful  jenny be strong now  you need to hold on dyou hear me  weve got things to do you and me eh  eh  we can go anywhere  everywhere you choose  that sounds good  youre my daughter  and weve only just got started  youre gonna be great  youre gonna be more than great  youre gonna be amazing  you hear me jenny  two hearts  two hearts shes like me  if we wait  if we just wait  theres no sign doctor  theres no regeneration shes like you but  maybe not enough  no  too much  thats the truth of it  she was too much like me  i never would  have you got that  i never would  when you start this new world  this world of human and hath  remember that  make the foundation of this society  a man who never would  its happening  the terraforming  build a city nice and safe underground  strip away the top soil  and there it is  and what about jenny  let us give her a proper ceremony  i think it would help us  please  jenny was the reason for the tardis bringing us here  it just got here too soon  which then created jenny in the first place  paradox  an endless paradox  time to go home yeah  home  you sure about this  yeah positive  i cant do this any more  youll be the same one day  not me never  how could i ever go back to normal life after seeing all this  im gonna travel with that man for ever  good luck and you  were making a habit of this yeah  and youd think itd get easier  all those things youve been ready to die for  i thought for a moment there  youd finally found something worth living for  oh  theres always something worth living for martha  bye doctor  goodbye  dr jones  hello boys  the shuttle  jenny whatre you doing come back sorry cant stop  what you gonna do tell my dad  but where are you going ohh ive got the whole universe
