like rats  but what could have scared her so she had such enormous spirit  rage rage against the dying of the light  i might use that  you cant its someone elses  but the thing is lynley drowned on dry land  dolly died of fright and they were both connected to you  youre accusing me  no but i saw a witch   big as you like  flying cackling away  and youve written about witches  i have when was that  notquite yet  peter streete spoke of witches  whos peter streete  our builder  he sketched the plans to the globe  the architect  hold on the architect the globe come on  the columns there right and 14 sides  ive always wondered but ive never asked will why 14 sides  it was the shape peter streete thought best thats all  he said it carried the sound well but 14  why does that ring a bell   so there is  good point words and shapes following the same design   oh my head  tetradecagon think words letters numbers lines  but this is just a theatre  yes but a theatres magic isnt it  you should know stand on this stage  say the right words with the right emphasis at the right time  oh you can make men weep  or cry with joy  change them  yu can change peoples minds just with words in this place  and if you exaggerate that  its like your police box small wooden box but with all that power inside  oh  oh martha jones i like you  tell you what though peter would know can i talk to him  you wont get an answer  a month after finishing this place lost his mind  why what happened  he started raving about witches hearing voices babbling  his mind was addled  where is he now  bedlam  whats bedlam  bethlem hospital the madhouse  weve gotta go there right now come on  im coming with you i want to witness this at first hand  ralph  the last scene as promised  copy it hand it round learn it speak it  back before curtainup and remember kid project  eyes and teeth you never know the queen might turn up  as if she never does  so tell me of freedonia  where women can be doctors writers actors  this countrys ruled by a woman  shes royal thats gods business  though you are a royal beauty  whoa nelly i know for a fact youve got a wife in the country  but martha this is town  come on we can all have a good flirt later  is that a promise doctor  oh 57 academics just punched the air now move  loves labours won  i dont think much of sequels theyre never as good as the original  have you seen this bit  he mustve been dozing off i dont even know what it means  that goes for most of his stuff  ah but at least its my speech  i get centre stage  the light of shadmochs hollow moon  doth shine on to a point in space  betwixt dravidian shores  what was that  dravidian shores and linear five  nine three o one six  a spirit stirs the ether  too soon too soon  naught to fear my mothers  it is merely a rehearsal of whats to come  and strikes the fulsome grove of rexel four  by all the saints  its a spirit  its a vile shade  i think we should never speak of this again  else well end up in bedlam ourselves  please please  does my lord doctor wish some entertainment while he waits  i can whip these mad men  theyll put on a good show for you  bandog and bedlam  no i dont  wait here my lords while i  make him decent for the lady  so you call this a hospital where patients are whipped to entertain the gentry  and you put your friend in here  oh its all so different in freedonia  but youre clever dyou honestly think this place does any good  ive been mad ive lost my mind  the fear of this place set me right again it serves its purpose  mad in what way  you lost your son  my only boy  the black death took him i wasnt even there  i didnt know im sorry  it made me question everything  the futility of this fleeting existence to be or not to be  ooh  thats quite good  you should write that down  maybe not bit pretentious  this way my lord  they can be dangerous  dont know their own strength  it helps if you dont whip them now get out  peter  peter streete  hes the same as he was  youll get nothing out of him  peter  what is this  i must see  that stranger  he was at the inn with shakespeare  i thought then he smelt of something new  now he visits the madhouse  the architect  peter im the doctor  go into the past  one year ago  let your mind go back  back to when everything was fine and shining  everything that happened in this year since happened to somebody else  it was just a story  let go  thats it  just let go  tell me the story peter  tell me about the witches  who is this doctor  why does he come now at our time of glory  doomfinger  transport yourself  doom the doctor  doom his hide  hide  the witches  spoke to peter  in the night they whispered  whispered  got peter to build the globe to their design their design  the 14 walls  always 14  when the work was done  they snapped poor peters wits  but where did peter see the witches where in the city  peter tell me  youve got to tell me where were they  allhallows street  too many words  what the hell  just one touch of the heart  noooo  a witch im seeing a witch  who would be next mmm  just one touch  ill stop your frantic hearts  poor fragile mortals  let us out let us out  thats not gonna work the whole buildings shouting that  who would die first mmm  well if youre looking for volunteers  no dont  doctor can you stop her  no mortal has power over me  oh but theres a power in words  if i can find the right one if i could just know you  none on earth has knowledge of us  now think humanoid female uses shapes and words to channel energy  ah 14  thats it 14  the 14 stars of the rexel planetary configuration  creature i name you  carrionite  what did you do  i named her  the power of a name  thats old magic  but theres no such thing as magic  its a different sort of science  you chose mathematics  the right numbers the right equation can split the atom  carrionites use words  use them for what  the end of the world  he knows us  he spoke our name  then he will know death  he will perish at my hand  my mothers the time approaches  you must away to the globe go i will join you  as soon as this doctor screams his last  the carrionites disappeared way back at the dawn of the universe  noone was sure whether they were real or legend  im going for real  but what do they want  a new empire on earth  a world of bones and blood and witchcraft  but how  im looking at the man with the words  me  but ive done nothing  hold on what were you doing last night when that carrionite was in the room  finishing the play  what happens on the last page  the boys get the girls they have a bit of a dance its all as funny and thoughtprovoking as usual  except those last few line  funny thing is  i dont actually remember writing them  thats it  they used you  they gave you the final words like a spell like a code loves labours won its a weapon  the right words spoken in the right place with the shape of the globe as an energyconverter  the plays the thing  and yes you can have that  we left the lovers of navarre  by cruel chance seprated  none to claim his heart their labours lost now will they find  loves labours won  allhallows street there it is  martha well track them down will get to the globe  whatever you do stop that play  ill do it all these years ive been the cleverest man around  next to you i know nothing  oh dont complain  im not its marvellous  good luck doctor  good luck shakespeare  once more unto the breach  i like that  wait a minute  that words are mine  oh just shift  the eye should have contentment where it rests  this spunout year i watch on  patience my sisters patience  and mewling poor drooped men in stenchd  stop the play  im sorry  adies and gentlemen but stop  this performance must end immediately  oh everyones a critic  the wordsmith fear not  i have the doll  im sorry youll get a refund  but this play must not be performed  is he drunk or what  get him out of the way  you must forgive our irksome will  hes been on the beer and feeling ill  there is naught can stop us now  allhallows street  but which house  thing is though am i missing something here  the world didnt end in look at me im living proof  back to the future its like back to the future  the film  no the novelisation yes the film  marty mcfly goes back and changes history  and he starts fading away  oh my god am i gonna fade  you and the entire future of the human race   it ends right now in 1599 if we dont stop it  but which house  make that witch house  i take it were expected  oh i think death has been waiting for you a very long time  right then  its my turn  i know how to do this  i name thee  carrionite  argh huh  what was wrong the finger  the power of a name works only once  observe  i gaze upon this bag of bones and now i name thee martha jones  what have you done  only sleeping alas  its curious  the name has less impact shes somehow out of her time  and as for you sir doctor  fascinating  there is no name  why would a man hide his title in such despair  oh but look  theres still one word with a power that aches  the naming wont work on me  but your heart grows cold  the north wind blows and carries down the distant  rose  oh big mistake  cos that name keeps me fighting  the carrionites vanished where did you go  the eternals found the right word to banish us into deep darkness  then how did you escape  new words new and glittering  from a mind like no other  shakespeare  his son perished  the grief of a genius   grief without measure  madness enough to allow us entrance  how many of you  just the three  but the play tonight shall restore the rest  then the human race will be purged as pestilence  and from this world we will lead the universe back    into the old ways of blood and magic  mmm busy schedule  but   first    youve got to get past me  oh that should be a pleasure  considering my enemy has such a     handsome shape  now thats one form of magic thats definitely not going to work on me  oh well see  what was that for what did you do  a souvenir  well give it back  well thats just cheating  behold doctor  men to carrionites are nothing  but puppets  now you might call that magic id call that a dna replication module  what use is your science now  oh my god doctor  dont worry ive got you  hold on mister  two hearts  youre making a habit of this  ow  ive only got one heart working  how do you people cope  i gotta get the other one started hit me hit me on the chest argh  argh other side  argh on the back on the back damned it  left a bit argh  lovely there we go badaboom  well what are you standing there for come on the globe  the doctor  dead  the ladies have prepared a show  maria means to present isis descending from the dewy orb of heavn  ah here comes costard  masters  were going the wrong way  no were not  were going the wrong way  behold the swinish sight of womans love  pish its out of season to be heavy disposed  it is now my mothers  the final words to activate the tetradecagon  betwixt dravidian shores and linear five nine three o one six seven point o two  and strikes the fulsome grove of rexel four  coradiating crystal activate  the portal opens  it begins  i told thee so i told thee  stage door  stop the play  i think that was it yes i said stop the play  i hit my head  yeah dont rub it youll go bald  i think thats my cue  now begins the millennium of blood  the doctor he lives  then watch this world become a blasted heath  they come  they come  come on will  history needs you  but what can i do  reverse it  how am i supposed to do that  the shape of the globe gives words power youre the wordsmith   the one true genius the only man clever enough to do it  what words i have none  youre william shakespeare  but these carrionite phrases they need such precision  trust yourself  with you the words just come like magic  the right sound the right shape the right rhythm words that last forever  thats what you do will you choose perfect words  do it improvise  close up this din of hateful dire decay  decomposition of your witches plot  you thieve my brains consider me your toy  my doting doctor tells me i am not  no words of power  foul carrionite spectres    cease your show between the points  seven six one three nine o  sevn six one three nine o  and banished like a tinkers cuss  i say to thee  god  expelliamus  expelliamus  expelliamus  good old jk  the deep darkness  they are consumed  no  loves labours won  there it goes  they think it was all special effects  your effect is special indeed  thats not your best line  and i say  a heart for a hart a dear for a deer  i dont get it  then give me a joke from freedonia  ok shakespeare walks into a pub  and the landlord says oi mate youre barred  oh thats brilliant  doesnt make sense mind you but never mind that come here  ive only just met you  the doctor might never kiss you why not entertain a man who will  i dont know how to tell you this oh great genius but    your breath doesnt half stink  good props store back there  not sure about this though  reminds me of a sycorax  sycorax nice word  ill have that off you as well  i

looked all over every single copy of loves labours won went up in the sky  my lost masterpiece  you could write it up again  yeah better not will  theres still power in those words  maybe itd best stay forgotten  oh but ive got new ideas  perhaps its time i wrote about fathers and sons  in memory of my boy my precious hamnet  hamnet  thats him  hamnet  whats wrong with that  anyway time we were
