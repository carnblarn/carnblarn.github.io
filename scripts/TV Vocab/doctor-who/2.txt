getting green lights at this end  honoured guests may be reassured that gravity pockets may cause slight turbulence thanking you  the whole place shook i felt it  ive hosted all sorts of events on platforms 1 3 6 and 15 and never felt the slightest tremor  i warn you if this lot decide to sue  im gonna scan the infrastructure  clicks and squeaks whats that  control i dont want to worry you but im picking up readings  i have no idea theyre small the scan says theyre metal  i dont know what they look like  although i imagine they might look rather like that  youre not on the guest list  how did you get on board  no sunfilter deactivated  no  sunfilter descending no  sunfilter up  no no no  control respond sunfilter descending  sunfilter up  sunfilter descending  he screams  indubitably this is the badboo scenario i find the inherent laxity of the unknown multiverse  that wasnt a gravity pocket i know gravity pockets and they dont feel like that what dyou think jabe  listen to the engines theyve pitched up about 30 hertz is that dodgy or what  its the sound of metal  it doesnt make any sense to me wheres the engine room i dont know  but the maintenance duct is just behind our guest suite i could show you and your wife  oh shes not my wife  partner no concubine  nope  prostitute whatever i am it must be invisible dyou mind  tell you what you two go pollinate ill catch up with family quick word with michael jackson  dont start a fight  im all yours  and i want you home by midnight  earthdeath in 15 minutes earthdeath in 15 minutes  whos in charge of platform one has it got a captain or what  theres just the steward and staff all the rest is controlled by the metalmind you mean the computer  well who controls that the corporation  they move platform one from one artistic event to another  theres noone from the corporation on board theyre not needed this facility is purely automatic  its the height of the alpha class  nothing can go wrong unsinkable  if you like the nautical metaphor is appropriate  youre telling me i was on board another ship they called unsinkable  i ended up clinging to an iceberg wasnt half cold  so what youre saying is if we get in trouble theres noone to help us out  im afraid not fantastic  i dont understand  in what way is that fantastic  soon the sun will blossom into a red giant  and my home will die  thats where i used to live when i was a little boy down there  mummy and daddy had a house built into the side of the los angeles crevasse ah id have such fun  what happened to everyone else the human race where did it go  they say mankind has touched every star in the sky  so youre not the last human  i am the last pure human  the others mingled  oh they call themselves new humans and protohumans and digihumans  even humanish   but dyou know what i call them  mongrels  right and you stayed behind  i kept myself pure  how many operations have you had   im having my blood bleached  is that why you wanted a word  you could be flatter rose youve got a little bit of a chin poking out  id rather die honestly it doesnt hurt  i mean it i would rather die  its better to die than to live like you a bitchy trampoline  oh well what do you know  i was born on that planet  and so was my mum and so was my dad and that makes me officially the last human being in this room  cos youre not human youve had it all nipped and tucked and flattened till theres nothing left  anything human got chucked in the bin youre just skin cassandra lipstick and skin  nice talking  so tell me jabe whats a tree like you doing in a place like this  respect for the earth oh come on everyone on this platforms worth zillions  well perhaps its a case of having to be seen at the right occasions  in case your share prices drop i know you lot youve got massive forests roots everywhere  and theres always money in land all the same we respect the earth as family  so many species evolved from that planet mankind is only one  im another my ancestors were transplanted from the planet down below and im a direct descendant  of the tropical rainforest  excuse me  and what about your ancestry doctor  perhaps you could tell a story or two  perhaps a man only enjoys trouble when theres nothing else left  i scanned you earlier  the metalmachine had trouble identifying your species  it refused to admit your existence  and even when it named you i wouldnt believe it  but it was right  i know where youre from  forgive me for intruding but its remarkable that you even exist  i just want to say  how sorry i am  slow chuffing  is it me or is it a bit nippy  she cries out  fair dos though  thats a great bit of airconditioning sort of nice and oldfashioned  bet they call it retro  gotcha  what the hells that is it part of the retro  i
