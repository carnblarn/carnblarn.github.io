                i wonder whats wrong with her shes sort of queasy  indigestion like she didnt want to land  if you think theres gonna be trouble we could always get back inside and go somewhere else  i think weve landed inside a cupboard here we go  synthesised voice open door 15 wind howls  some sort of base moon base sea base space base  they build these things out of kits glad were indoors  sounds like a storm out there  open door 16  human design youve got a thing about kits  its put together like a flatpack wardrobe only bigger and easier  open door 17  oh its a sanctuary base  close door 17 deep space exploration weve gone way out and listen to that  continuous whirring underneath someones drilling  welcome to hell oh its not that bad  no over there  hold on what does that say  thats weird it wont translate  i thought the tardis translated everything writing as well  i should see english exactly  and if thats not working then it means  this writing is old very old  impossibly old  we should find out whos in charge  weve gone beyond the reach of the tardis knowledge not a good move  if someones looking we shouldnt   oh  right hello sorry i was just saying nice base  we must feed youve got to what  we must feed yeah i think they mean us we must feed  we must feed we must feed  we must feed  we must feed we must feed  in unison we must feed we must feed we must feed we must feed we must feed  we must feed we must feed we must feed    we must feed   globe rattles   you if you are hungry  sorry we apologise  electromagnetics have interfered with speech systems  would you like some refreshment  um   open door 18  what the hell  how did     captain youre not gonna believe this weve got people  out of nowhere i mean real people  i mean two living people just standing here right in front of me  dont be stupid thats impossible  i suggest telling them that  but youre a space base  you must have visitors it cant be that impossible  are you telling me you dont know where you are no idea more fun that way  stand by everyone buckle down we have incoming  and its a big one quake 05 on its way  through here now  quickly come on move  keep moving keep moving come on move it  oh my god you meant it  people look at that real people  thats us hooray yeah definitely real  my names rose rose tyler and this is the doctor  come on the oxygen must be offline  were hallucinating they cant be   no theyre real  come on were in the middle of an alert  danny strap up the quakes coming in  impact in 30 seconds  sorry you two whoever you are just hold on  tight hold on to what anything i dont care just hold on  ood are we fixed  your kindness in this emergency is much appreciated  whats this planet called anyway dont be stupid it hasnt got a name how could it have a name  you really dont know do you and  impact  oh well that wasnt so    thats it everyone all right  speak to me ida yeah yeah  danny fine toby  fine scooti no damage jefferson check  were fine thanks dont worry about us  surface caved in i deflected it onto storage five through eight  weve lost them completely  toby go and check the rocket link  thats not my department  just do as i say yeah  metal creaks and groans  oxygen holding metallic creaks internal gravity at 566  we should be ok  never mind the earthquake thats    thats one hell of a storm what is that a hurricane  you need an atmosphere for a hurricane theres no air out there its a complete vacuum  then whats shaking the roof youre not joking  you really dont know well  introductions  fyi as they said in the olden days im ida scott science officer  zachary cross flane acting captain sir  youve met mr jefferson hes head of security danny bartock ethics committee  not as boring as it sounds  and that man who just left thats toby zed archaeology and this    scooti manista trainee maintenance  and this    this is home  brace yourselves  the sight of it sends some people mad  thats a black hole  thats impossible    i did warn you were standing under a black hole  in orbit we cant be  you can see for yourself were in orbit  but we cant be  this lump of rock is suspended in perpetual geostationary orbit around that black hole  without falling in  discuss   and thats bad yeah  bad doesnt cover it a black holes a dead star it collapses in on itself in and in and in  until the matters so dense and tight it starts to pull everything else in too  nothing in the universe can escape it  light gravity time everything gets pulled inside  and crushed  so there cant be an orbit  we should be pulled right in  we should be dead and yet  here we are  beyond the laws of physics thuds and creaks  welcome on board but if theres no atmosphere out there whats that  stars breaking up  gas clouds  we have whole solar systems being ripped apart above our heads  before falling into that thing  so a bit worse than a storm then  just a bit just a bit yeah  whispery echo toby y y y    electrics fizz and pop  whos that  danny  close door one the rocket links fine  thats the black hole officially designated k 3 7 gem 5  in the scriptures of the veltino  this planets called krop tor   the bitter pill  and the black hole is supposed to be a mighty demon who was tricked into devouring the planet  only to spit it out  because it was poison  the bitter pill i like that  were so far out  lost in the drifts of the universe how did you even get here  we flew in dyou see  this planets generating a gravity field  we dont know how weve no idea  but its kept in constant balance against the black hole  and the field extends out there  as a funnel a distinct    gravity funnel reaching out into clear space that was our way in  you flew down that thing  like a rollercoaster  by rights the ship shouldve been torn apart  we lost the captain which is what put me in charge  and youre doing a good job yeah well needs must  but if that gravity funnel closes theres no way out  oh we have fun speculating about that  yeah thats the word fun  but that field would take phenomenal amounts of power  not just big but off the scale  can i  sure help yourself  your refreshment  oh yeah thanks thank you  im sorry what was your name  we have no titles  we are as one  um   what are they called  oh come on whereve you been living everyones got one  well not me so what are they  theyre the ood the ood  the ood thats  ood  very ood but handy  they work the mineshaft all the drilling and stuff supervision and maintenance theyre born for it  basic slave race youve got slaves  dont start shes like one of that lot the friends of the ood  well maybe i am yeah since when did humans need slaves  but the ood offer themselves  if you dont give them orders they just pine away and die  seriously you like being ordered about  it is all we crave whys that then  we have nothing else in life  yeah well i used to think like that  long time ago there we go dyou see  to generate that gravity field and the funnel you need a power source  with an inverted self extrapolating reflex of six to the power of six every six seconds all the sixes  and its impossible it took us two years to work that out  im very good  but thats why were here  this power source is ten miles below through solid rock  point zero were drilling down to try and find it  its giving off readings of over could revolutionise modern science  we could use it to fuel the empire  or start a war  its buried beneath us   in the darkness waiting  whats your job  chief dramatist  whatever it is down there its not a natural phenomenon  this planet once supported life  aeons ago before the human race had even learned to walk  i saw that lettering on the wall did you do that i copied it from fragments weve found  unearthed by the drilling i cant translate it no neither can i  and thats saying something there was some form of civilisation  they buried something and now its reaching out  calling us in and you came  how could we not  so when it comes right down to it why did you come here  why did you do that why  ill tell you why  because it was there brilliant  scuse me   er zack wasnt it  thats me just stand there cos im gonna  hug you is that all right  suppose so here we go coming in  human beings you are amazing  thank you  not at all youre also completely mad you should pack your bags get on that ship and fly for your lives  you can talk how the hell did you get here  ive got this    um  this  ship its hard to explain it just sort of appears  we can show you we parked down the corridor from uh   whats it called habitation area    three three  dyou mean storage six  it was a bit of a cupboard yeah    storage six but you said    you said    you said storage five to eight    what is it whats wrong open door 19    close door 19  grr come on open door 17  open door 15  door 16 out of commission it cant be  whats wrong what is it  doctor the tardis is in there whats happened  the tardis has gone  door 16 out of commission  the earthquake  this section collapsed  but its got to be out there somewhere  look down   the ground gave way my tardis mustve fallen right into the heart of the planet  but youve robot drills heading the same way we cant divert the drilling  but i need my ship its all ive got  literally the only thing  doctor weve only got the resources to dig one central shaft down to the power source and thats it  no diversions no distractions no exceptions  your machine is lost all i can do is offer you a lift if we ever get to leave this place  and thats the end of it  ill put you on the duty roster  we need someone in the laundry  open door one  close door one  ive trapped you here no dont worry about me  ok were on a planet that shouldnt exist  underneath a black hole  with no way out  yeah changed my mind start worrying about me  entering night shift  your chosen track for transition is ravels bolero  music plays  all finished  heading back inside  music continues    music on pa  pa crackles mid note  pa silent  tobyyy  i can see you danny is that you   its not funny all right  dan  im trying to work daniel  if thats you then can you just stop it  electrics fizz and whine

did that job once i was a dinner lady  not that im calling you a lady  although i dont know you might be  dyou actually get paid though do they give you money  the beast and his armies shall rise from the pit to make war against god  im sorry  apologies i said i hope you enjoy your meal  yeah  drillhead now at point 16  drillhead speed increasing  keep pressure at 60  close door three  close door three  he is awake  what did you say  close door three  toby  deep voice dont turn around  dan  thats not dan dont look at me  who are you  i have so many names  if i could    if you look at me you will die  but who are you  im behind you toby  im right behind you  dont look dont look at me  one look and you will die  im reaching out toby  im so close  dont turn around  oh h   i can touch you  no     electrical fizz  zack we got a problem  zak no more than usual weve just got the scarlet system burning up might be worth a look  you might want to see this moment in history  there  on the edge  that red cloud  that used to be the scarlet system  home to the pallushi  a mighty civilisation spanning a billion years  disappearing  forever  their planets and suns consumed  ladies and gentlemen  we have witnessed its passing  no could you leave it open  just for a bit  i wont go mad i promise  how would you know  scooti check the lockdown jefferson sign off the airlock seals for me  synthetic voice open door 18  ive seen films and things yeah they say black holes are like gateways to another universe  close door 18  not that one  it just eats  long way from home  go that way  turn right keep going for er    about 500 years then youll reach the earth  no signal thats the first time weve gone out of range  mind you even if i could    what would i tell her  can you build another tardis  they were grown not built  and with my home planet gone    were kind of stuck  well could be worse this lot said theyd give us a lift  and then what i dunno  find a planet  get a job live a life  same as the rest of the universe  id have to settle down  get a house or something a proper house with    doors and things carpets  me living in a house now that    that   that is terrifying  youd have to get a mortgage no oh yes im dying thats it im dying its all over  what about me id have to get one too  i dunno could be the same one we could both    i dunno share  or not whatever i dunno  all sorts of   anyway well see  i promised jackie id always take you back home  everyone leaves home in the end  not to end up stuck here  yeah but stuck with you thats not so bad  yeah  yes  mobile rings  deep voice he is awake  evening  only us the mysterious couple  how are you then settling in yeah sorry straight to business the ood  how do they communicate i mean with each other oh just empaths  theres a low level telepathic field connecting them  not that that does them much good theyre basically a herd race like cattle this telepathic field  can it pick up messages cos i was having dinner and one of the ood said something  well odd  an odd ood and then i got something else on my er    communicator thing well be fair  weve got whole star systems burning up around us  theres all sorts of stray transmissions probably nothing  look if there was something wrong it would show  we monitor the telepathic field its the only way to look after them  theyre so stupid they dont even tell us when theyre ill  monitor the field thats this thing  yeah but like i said its low level telepathy  they only register basic 5  thats not basic 5 10     theyve gone up to basic 30  but they cant doctor the ood  what does basic 30 mean  it means that theyre shouting screaming inside their heads  or somethings shouting at them  but wheres it coming from whats it saying  what did it say to you something about the beast and the pit  what about your communicator what did that say  he is awake  all ood and you will worship him  what the hell he is awake  and you will worship him  worship who  whos talking to you who is it  toby ive got your expenditure  open door 41  close door 41 door mechanism hisses   close door 40  computer did you open and close door 41 confirmed  but  thats the airlock why would you open the airlock  its the night shift were not allowed outside  has someone gone out confirmed  but who was it cannot confirm  ok right hold on i know tell me whose space suits been logged out  no space suit has been logged out but   youre not making any sense you cant go outside without    zack i think weve got a breakdown on door 41 its saying somebodys gone out onto the planets surface  static hiss zack  zack  computer trace fault there is no fault  tell me who went through that door  he is awake  what he is awake  whats that supposed to mean he bathes in the black sun  toby  theres no air theres no    no stop it you cant be  open door 40 open door 40 open door 40  open door 40  open door 40 open    emergency hull breach  emergency hull breach emergency hull breach  which section everyone evacuate  the base is open repeat the base is open  open door 19  close door 19  i cant contain the oxygen field were gonna lose it come on  keep moving  and you sunshine get in  breach sealed breach sealed what happened what was it  hull breach we were open to the elements  another minute wed be inspecting that black hole close up that wasnt a quake what caused it  weve lost sections 11 to 13 everyone all right  weve got everyone except scooti  scooti report  scooti manista this is an order report  shes all right ive picked up her biochip shes in habitation three  better go and check if shes not responding she might be unconscious  but how about that eh we survived  habitation three come on i dont often say this but i think we could all do with a drink  come on  what happened i i dont know i was working and then i cant remember  a all that noise the room was falling apart there was no air    come on up you get come and have some protein 1  ooh youve gone native oi dont knock it its nice protein 1 with just a dash of 3  check habitation four   theres no sign but the biochip says shes in this area  scooti please respond if you can hear this please respond habitation six nowhere here    zack weve got a problem scootis still missing  zack but it says habitation three  yeah well thats where i am and im telling you shes not here  ive found her  oh my god  sorry im so sorry  captain  report officer scootori manista pkd    deceased   she was 20   for how should man die better than facing fearful odds  for the ashes of his father and the temples    of his gods  background whirr dies away  its stopped  faint clashing echo what was that  what was it the drill  weve stopped drilling weve made it point zero  zack all non essential oods to be confined  capsule established all systems functioning  the mineshaft is go  bring systems online now  reporting as volunteer for the expeditionary force sir doctor this breaks every single protocol  we dont even know who you are yeah but you trust me dont you  and you cant let ida go down there on her own go on  look me in the eye yes you do i can see it trust  i should be going down the captain doesnt lead the mission he stays here in charge  not much good at it am i  positions were going down in two  everyone positions  mr jefferson i want maximum systems    oxygen nitrobalance gravity its ages since i wore one of these  i want that spacesuit back in one piece you got that yes sir  sfunny cos people back home think that space travels gonna be all    whizzing about and    teleports anti gravity  but its not is it its tough  ill see you later  not if i see you first  you will remain here  no command can override this  have you got that  my instructions only  capsule active  counting down in ten  nine    eight seven six  five four three  two one release  youve gone beyond the oxygen field youre on your own  dont forget to breathe  breathings good  rose stay off the comm no chance  klaxon  doctor  doctor are you all right  ida report to me  doctor  its all right weve made it were getting out of the capsule now  whats it like down there  hard to tell  some sort of  cave cavern its massive  this should help  gravity globe  thats   thats    oh my god thats beautiful  rose    you can tell toby    weve found his civilisation  oi toby sounds like youve got plenty of work  good good    good  concentrate now people keep on the mission ida what about the power source  were close energy signature indicates north north west  are you getting pictures up there  too much interference  were in your hands  well weve come this far theres no turning back  oh did you have to no turning back   thats almost as bad as nothing can possibly go wrong or  its gonna be the best christmas walfords ever had have you finished  yeah ive finished  captain sir theres something happening with the ood  what are they doing  theyre staring at me ive told them to stop but they wont  danny youre a big boy i think you can take being stared at  but the telepathic field sir its at basic 100 ive checked  but there isnt any fault  its definitely 100  but thats impossible whats basic 100 mean  they should be dead basic 100 is brain death  but theyre safe theyre not actually moving  no sir keep watching them  and you jefferson keep a guard on the ood officer at arms  you cant fire a gun in here what if you hit a wall  firing stock 15 only impacts upon organics keep watch guard them yes sir  is everything all right up there yeah yeah its fine  great  weve found something  it looks like metal like some sort of seal  ive got a nasty feeling the word might be trapdoor  not a good word trapdoor never met a trapdoor i liked  the edge is covered with those symbols dyou think it opens thats what trapdoors tend to do  trapdoor doesnt do it justice its massive zack  about 30 feet in diameter  any way of opening it dont know i cant see any sort of mechanism  i suppose thats the writing itll tell us what to do  the letters that defy translation  toby did you get anywhere decoding it  toby they need to know that lettering does it make any sense  i know what it says then tell them  when did you work that out just tell them  deep voice these are the words of the beast  and he has woken he is the heart that beats in the darkness he is the blood that will never cease  and now he will rise  officer you will stand down stand down  what is it whats he done whats happening  rose what going on  jefferson report    report  officer youve compromised security you will stand down and be confined immediately  mr jefferson tell me sir    did your wife ever forgive you  i dont know what you mean  let me tell you a secret she never did  officer you will stand down and be confined  or what  under condition red im authorised to shoot you  but how many can you kill  in unison we are the legion of the beast  rose what is it rose  im going back up zack report report  jefferson report  someone report  the legion shall be many and the legion shall be few  its the ood  sir we have contamination of the livestock  doctor i dont know what it is its like theyre possessed  they wont listen to us  he has woven himself through the fabric of your life  since the dawn of time  some may call him abbadon some may call him krop tor  some may call him satan or    captain its the ood theyre out of control   king of despair  the deathless prince the bringer of night  these are the words that shall set him free  back up to the door i am become manifest  i shall walk in the light to the door  and my legions will swarm   get out  across the worlds  doctor  its opening  were moving  the whole things moving the planets moving  i am the sin and the temptation  and the desire  i am the pain and the loss and the death of hope get that door open  the gravity field its going  were losing orbit  were gonna fall into the black hole  deep voice i have been imprisoned for eternity  but no more  door seal  move door seal  the pit is open  and i am free  evil laugh    bbc 2006  its the ood theyve gone mad  doctor can you hear me doctor ida are you there  danny turn right that thing is playing on very basic fears  the cables snapped get out  you will die and i will live
