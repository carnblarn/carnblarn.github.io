thrill is in the chase never in the capture  mrs christie im so glad you could come  im one of your greatest followers  ive read all six of your books  is mr christie not joining us  is he needed  cant a woman make her own way in the world  dont give my wife ideas  now mrs christie ive a question  why a belgian detective  belgians make such lovely buns  i say where on earths professor peach  hed love to meet mrs christie  said he was going to the library  miss chandrakala would you go and collect the professor  at once my lady  the date on this newspaper  what about it  its the day agatha christie disappeared  professor peach  professor  shed just discovered her husband was having an affair  youd never think to look at her   smiling away  well  shes british and moneyed  thats what they do they carry on  except for this one time  noone knows exactly what happened she just vanished  her car will be found by the side of a lake  ten days later agatha christie turns up in a hotel in harrogate  said shed lost her memory  she never spoke about the disappearance till the day she died  but whatever it was  its about to happen  right here right now  professor the library  murder murder  oh my goodness  bashed on the head a blunt instrument  watch broke as he fell time of death was a quarter past four  bit of pipe  call me hercule poirot but i reckon thats blunt enough  nothing worth killing for in that lot dry as dust  hold on the body in the library  i mean professor peach in the library with the lead piping   let me see  out of my way   gerald  saints preserve us   oh how awful  someone should call the police  no need  chief inspector smith known as the doctor  miss nobles the plucky young girl who helps me out   i say  mrs christie was right  go into the sitting room i will question each of you in turn  come along do as the doctor says  leave the room undisturbed  the plucky young girl who helps me out  no policewomen in 1926  ill pluck you in a minute why dont we phone the real police  well the last thing we want is pc plod sticking his nose in  especially  now ive found this  morphic residue  morphic doesnt sound very 1926  gets left behind when certain species genetically reencode  the murderers an alien  which means one of that lot is an alien in human form  yeah but think about it  theres a murder a mystery and agatha christie  so happens to me all the time  no but isnt that a bit weird  agatha christie didnt walk around surrounded by murders  not really  i mean thats like meeting charles dickens and hes surrounded by ghosts  at christmas   well  oh come on  its not like we could drive across country  and find enid blyton having tea with noddy  could we noddys not real  is he tell me theres no noddy  theres no noddy  next thing you know youll be telling me its like  murder on the orient express  and they all did it   murder on the orient express  oh yeah  one of your best  but not yet   marvellous idea though  yeah  tell you what copyright donna noble okay  anyway agatha and i will question the suspects  donna you search the bedrooms look for clues  any more residue youll need this   is that for real  go on  youre ever so plucky  right then solving a murder mystery  with agatha christie brilliant  how like a man to have fun while theres disaster all around him  sorry yeah  ill work with you gladly  but for the sake of justice not your own amusement  now then reverend  where were you at a quarter past four  let me think  why yes i remember  i was unpacking in my room  no alibi then  you were alone  with the lord one is never truly alone  and where were you  let me think i was  oh yes i was taking a constitutional in the fields behind the house  just taking a stroll thats all   alone  oh yes all alone  totally alone absolutely alone  completely all of the time  i wandered lonely as the proverbial cloud  there was noone else with me not at all  not ever  and where were you  at a quarter past four  well i went to the toilet when i arrived and then erm  oh yes i remember  i was preparing myself  positively buzzing with excitement about the party  and the super fun of meeting lady eddy   weve only got your word for it  thats your problem not mine  and where were you sir  quarter past four dear me let me think  ah yes i remember  i was in me study reading through military memoirs  fascinating stuff  took me back to my days in the army  started reminiscing  mafeking you know  terrible war  colonel snap out of it   i was in my study  no no no   right out of it  oh sorry  got a bit carried away there  and where were you at a quarter past four my lady  now let me see  yes i remember  i was sitting in the blue room taking my afternoon tea  its a ritual of mine  i needed to gather strength for the duty of hostess  i then proceeded to the lawn  where i met you doctor and i said  and who exactly might you be and what are you doing here  and you said im the doctor  and this is miss donna noble  yes yes you can stop now  i was there for that bit  of course  excuse me  no alibis for any of them  the secret adversary remains hidden  we must look for a motive  use the little grey cells  oh yes little grey cells  good old poirot  do you know ive been to belgium yeah  i remember  i was deep in the ardennes trying to find charlemagne  hed been kidnapped by an insane computer  doctor  sorry  charlemagne lived centuries ago  ive got a very good memory  for such an experienced detective you missed a big clue  that bit of paper on the fire   you were looking the other way  yeah but i saw your reflection  in the glass of the bookcase  you crafty man  and this is all that was left  whats that first letter n or m  its an m the word is maiden  maiden  what does that mean  were still no further forward  our nemesis remains at large  unless miss nobles found something  you wont find anything in there   how come its locked  lady eddison commands it to be so  and i command it to be otherwise  scotland yard pippip  whys it locked in the first place  many years ago when my father was butler to the family  lady eddison returned from india with malaria  she locked herself in this room for six months until she recovered  since then the room has remained undisturbed  theres nothing in here  how longs it been empty  forty years  why would she seal it off  all right i need to investigate you just  buttle off  1926 theyve still got bees  oh what a noise all right busy bee ill let you out  hold on  i shall find you with my amazing powers of detection  thats impossible  doctor  doctor  its a giant wasp  what dyou mean a giant wasp  i mean a wasp thats giant  its only a silly little insect  when i say giant  i dont mean big  i mean flippin enormous  look at its sting  let me see  its gone  buzzed off  but thats fascinating  dont touch it  dont touch it let me  giant wasp  well tons of amorphous insectivorous lifeforms  but none in this galactic vector  i think i understood some of those words  enough to know that youre completely potty  lost its sting though that makes it defenceless  creature this size got to be able to grow a new one  can we return to sanity  there are no such things as giant wasps  exactly so the question is  whats it doing here  a murder thats put the cat among the pigeons and no mistake  its not the stuff of gossip mrs hart  continue with your work  but whod want to do in the old professor  he was always asking questions about that book of his  what was all that about  a dead mans folly nothing more  though perhaps if he asked about  i must go and see mylady  the poor little child  there  come on  hey this makes a change  theres a monster and were chasing it  cant be a monster its a trick  they do it with mirrors  by all thats holy  oh but you are wonderful  now just stop stop there  oi fly boy  dont let it get away  quick before it reverts back to human form  where are you come on  theres nowhere to run show yourself  thats just cheating  my faithful companion this is terrible  excuse me my lady but she was on her way to tell you something  she never found me  she had an appointment with death instead  she said the poor little child  does that mean anything to anyone  no children in this house for years  highly unlikely there will be  mrs christie you must have twigged something  youve written simply the best detective stories  tell us what would poirot do  heavens sake cards on the table woman  you should be helping us  but  im merely a writer  surely you can crack it  these events theyre exactly like one of your plots  thats what ive been saying agatha thats gotta mean something  but what  ive no answers none  im sorry all of you im truly sorry  but ive failed  if anyone can help us then its the doctor not me  do you know what i think  those books of yours  one day they could turn them into films  they could be talking pictures  talking pictures  pictures that talk what do you mean  oh blimey ive done it again  i appreciate you trying to be kind  but youre right  these murders are like my own creations  its as though someones mocking me  and ive had enough scorn for one lifetime  yeah  thing is i had this bloke once  i was engaged and i loved him i really did  turns out he was lying through his teeth  but dyou know what i moved on  i was lucky i found the doctor  its changed my life  theres always someone else  i see  is my marriage the stuff of gossip now  no i just  sorry  no matter  the stories are true  i found my husband with another woman  a younger prettier woman isnt it always the way  well mine was with a giant spider  but same difference  you and the doctor talk such wonderful nonsense  agatha people love your books they really do  theyre gonna be reading them for years to come  if only try as i might its hardly great literature  now thats beyond me  im afraid my books will be forgotten  like ephemera  hello whats that  those flower beds were perfectly neat earlier  now some of the stalks are bent over  there you go  whod ever notice that  youre brilliant  oh someone came here tooled up  the sort of stuff a thief would use  the unicorn hes here  the unicorn and the wasp  your drinks ladies doctor  very good greeves  how about the science stuff what did you find  vespiform sting  vespiforms have got hives in the silfrax galaxy  again you talk like edward lear  but for some reason this ones behaving like a character in one of your books  come on agatha what would miss marple do  shed have overheard something vital  because the murderer thinks shes a harmless old lady  clever idea  miss marple who writes those  um copyright donna noble add it to the list   donna  okay we could split the copyright  no  somethings inhibiting my enzymes  ah ive been poisoned  what do we do  what do we do  bitter almonds its cyanide  sparkling cyanide   ginger beer  i beg your pardon  i need ginger beer  the gentlemans gone mad  im an expert in poisons doctor theres no cure  its fatal  not for me i can stimulate the inhibited enzymes into reversal  protein i need protein   walnuts  brilliant  i cant understand you how many words  one one word  shake milk shake milk  milk no not milk  hum shake shake shake  cocktail shaker what do you want a harvey wallbanger   harvey wallbanger  well i dont know  how is harvey wallbanger one word  what do you need doctor  salt i was miming salt salt i need something salty  what about this  what is it salt thats too salty  oh thats too salty  what about this   whats that  anchovies  what is it what else  its a song mammy   i dont know camptown races  camptown races  all right then towering inferno  its a shock look shock i need a shock  right then  big shock coming up  detox  i must do that more often  i mean the detox  doctor you are impossible  who are you  a terrible day for all of us  the professor struck down  miss chandrakala cruelly taken from us  and yet we still take dinner  we are british doctor  what else must we do  then someone tried to poison me  any one of you had the chance to put cyanide in my drink  but it rather gave me an idea   and what would that be  well  poison  drink up  ive laced the soup with pepper  ah i thought it was jolly spicy  but the active ingredient of pepper  is piperine  traditionally used as an insecticide  so anyone got the shivers   what the deuce is that  listen listen listen  no it cant be  show yourself demon  no dont  dont dont stay where you are  out out out  not you agatha youve got a long life to lead yet  well we know the butler didnt do it  then who did  my jewellery  the firestone its gone  stolen  roger  my son my child  that poor footman  rogers dead and he cant even mourn him   did you enquire after the necklace  lady eddison brought it back from india  its worth thousands  this thing can sting it can fly  it could wipe us all out in seconds whys it playing this game  every murder is essentially the same  they are committed because somebody wants something   but what does a vespiform want  doctor stop it  the murderer is as human as you or i  youre right  ive been so caught up with giant wasps ive forgotten   youre the expert  im not ive told you  im just a purveyor of nonsense  no no no cos plenty of people write detective stories  but yours are the best and why  why are you so good agatha christie  because you understand  youve lived youve fought youve had your heart broken  you know about people  their passions their hope and despair and anger  all of those tiny huge things  that can turn the most ordinary person into a killer  just think agatha  if anyone can solve this  its you  ive called you here on this endless night  because we have a murderer in our midst  and when it comes to detection theres none finer  ladies and gentlemen i give you agatha christie  this is a crooked house  a house of secrets  to understand the solution we must examine them all  starting with you  miss redmond  but im innocent surely  youve never met these people  and these people had never met you  i think the real robina redmond never left london   youre impersonating her  how silly  what proof do you have  you said youd been to the toilet  oh i know this if she was really posh shed say loo  earlier today miss noble and i found this on the lawn  right beneath your bathroom window  you heard miss noble was searching the bedrooms and panicked  you ran upstairs and disposed ofthe evidence  ive never seen that thing before in my life  whats inside it  the tools of your trade miss redmond  or should i say  the unicorn  you came to this house with one sole intention  to steal the firestone  oh all right then  its a fair cop  yes im the bleedin unicorn  ever so nice to meet yai dont fink  i took my chance in the dark and nabbed it  well go on then you knobs  arrest me  sling me in jail  so is she the murderer  dont be so thick  i might be a thief but i aint no killer  quite  there are darker motives at work  and in examining this household we come to you  colonel  damn it woman  you with your perspicacity  youve rumbled me  hugh you can walk  but why  my darling  how else could i be certain of keeping you by my side  i dont understand  youre still a beautiful woman clemency  sooner or later some chap will turn your head  i couldnt bear that  staying in the chair  was the only way i could be certain of keeping you  confound it mrs christie  how did you discover the truth  actually i had no idea  i was just going to say youre completely innocent  sorry   shall i sit down then  i think you better had   so hes not the murderer  indeed not  to find the truth  lets return  to this  far more than the unicorns object of desire  the firestone has quite a history   lady eddison  ive done nothing  you brought it back from india did you not  before you met the colonel  you came home with malaria  and confined yourself to this house for six months  in a room that has been kept locked ever since  which i rather think means   stop please  im so sorry  but you had fallen pregnant in india  unmarried and ashamed  you hurried back to england with your confidante a young maid  later to become housekeeper miss chandrakala  clemency is this true  my poor baby  i had to give him away  the shame of it   but youve never said a word  i had no choice  imagine the scandal the family name  im british i carry on  and it was no ordinary pregnancy  how can you know that  scuse me agatha this is my territory  but when you heard that buzzing sound in the dining room  you said it cant be  why did you say that  youd never believe it  the doctor has opened my mind to believe many things  it was forty years ago in the heat of delhi late one night  i was alone and thats when i saw it  a dazzling light in the sky  the next day he came to the house  christopher the most handsome man id ever seen  our love blazed like a wildfire  i held nothing back  and in return  he showed me the incredible truth about himself  hed made himself human to learn about us  this was his true shape  i loved him so much it didnt matter  but he was stolen from me  1885 the year of the great monsoon  the river jumna rose up and broke its banks  he was taken at the flood  but christopher left me a gift a jewel like no other  i wore it always part of me never forgot  i kept it close  always  just like a man flashes his family jewels  and you end up with a bun in the oven  a poor little child  forty years ago miss chandrakala took that newborn babe to an orphanage  but professor peach worked it out  he found the birth certificate  oh thats maiden maiden name  precisely   so she killed him  i did not  miss chandrakala feared that the professor had unearthed your secret   she was coming to warn you  so she killed her   i did not  lady eddison  is innocent  because at this point doctor  thank you at this point  when we consider the lies and the secrets  and the key to these events  then we have to consider  it was you donna noble  what  who did i kill  no but you said it all along  the vital clue  that this whole thing is being acted out like a murder mystery  which means  it was you agatha christie  i beg your pardon sir   so she killed them  no  but she wrote she wrote those brilliant clever books  and whos her greatest admirer  the moving finger points  at you   lady eddison  leave me alone   so she did kill them  no  but just think  last thursday night what were you doing  i was  i was in the library  i was reading my favourite agatha christie  thinking about her plots and how clever she must be   how is that relevant  just think  what else happened on thursday night   im sorry  you said on the lawn this afternoon  last thursday night those boys broke into your church  thats correct  they did  i discovered the two of them  thieves in the night i was most perturbed  what the blazes are you doing boys  but i apprehended them  really  a man of god against two strong lads  a man in his forties  or should i say  forty years old exactly  oh my god  lady eddison your child how old would he be now  forty hes forty  your child has come home  this is poppycock  oh you said you were taught by the christian fathers  meaning raised in an orphanage  my son can it be  you found those thieves reverend and you got angry  a proper deep anger for the first time in your life  and it broke the genetic lock  youve changed  put thozzze  thingzzz  back where you found them  you realised your inheritance  after all those years  you knew who you were  oh and then it all kicks off cos this isnt just a jewel  its a vespiform telepathic recorder  its part of you your brain your very essence  and when you activated so did the firestone  it beamed your full identity directly into your mind  and at the same time  it absorbed the works of agatha christie directly from lady eddison  it all became part of you  the mechanics of those novels formed a template in your brain  youve killed in this pattern because thats what you think the world is  turns out we are in the middle of a murder mystery  one of yours dame agatha  dame  oh sorry not yet  so he killed them  yes definitely  yes  well  this has certainly been an entertaining evening  really you cant believe any of this surely lady eddizzzzon  lady who  lady eddizzzzon  little bit of buzzing there vicar   dont make me angry  why  what happens then  damn it  you humanzzzzzzz  worshipping your tribal sky godzzzz  i am so much more  that night the universe exploded in my mind  i wanted to take what wazzz mine  and you agatha christie  with your railway station bookstall romancezzz   whatzzz to stop me killing you  oh my dear god  my child  whatszz to stop me killing you all   forgive me  no no clemency come back  keep away keep away my darling  no no more murder  if my imagination made you kill  then my imagination will find a way to stop you  foul creature  wait now its chasing us  over here come and get me reverend  agatha what are you doing  if i started this doctor then i must stop it  come on  its all my fault its all my fault its all my fault  you said this is the night agatha christie loses her memory  time is in flux donna  this could be the night  agatha christie loses her life and history gets changed  wheres she going  the lake shes heading for the lake  whats she doing  here i am the honey in the trap  come to me vespiform  shes controlling it  its mind is based on her thought processes   theyre linked  quite so doctor  if i die then this creature might die with me  dont hurt her  youre not meant to be like this  youve got the wrong template in your mind  its not listening  how do you kill a wasp  drown it just like his father  donna that thing couldnt help itself  neither could i  death comes as the end and justice is served  murder at the vicars rage  needs a bit of work  just one mystery left doctor  who exactly are you  oh its the firestone its part of the vespiforms mind  its dying and its connected to agatha  it let her go  right at the end the vespiform chose to save someones life   is she all right though  oh of course the amnesia  wiped her mind of everything the wasp the murders  and us shell forget about us  yeah but weve solved another riddle  the mystery of agatha christie  and tomorrow morning her car gets found by the side of a lake  a few days later she turns up in a hotel in harrogate  with no idea of what just happened  noonell ever know  lady eddison and the colonel and all the staff what about them  a shameful story theyd never talk of it  too british  while the unicorn does a bunk back to london town  she could never even say she was there  but what happens to agatha  oh great life met another man  married again  saw the world  wrote and wrote and wrote  she never thought her books were any good though  and she mustve spent all those years wondering  thing is  i dont think she ever quite forgot  a great mind like that some of the details kept bleeding through  all the stuff her imagination could use  like miss marple  i shouldve made her sign a contract  and where is it where is it hold on  here we go  c  that is c for cybermen  c for carrionites  and  christie agatha  look at that  she did remember  somewhere in the back of her mind it all lingered  and thats not all  look at the copyright page  facsimile edition published in the year  5 billion  people never stop reading them  she is the best selling novelist of all time  but she never knew  well noone knows how theyre going to be remembered  all you can do is hope for the best  maybe thats what kept her writing  same thing keeps me travelling  onwards  onwards  this is the biggest library in the universe  so where is everyone  run  for gods sake run  run  professor river song archaeologist  the shadows are moving again  how could a shadow be infected  its vashta nerada   run  whats kal  something came to this library and killed everything in it   donna  yeah  stay out of the shadows
