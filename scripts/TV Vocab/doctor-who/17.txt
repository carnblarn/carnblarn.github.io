a space ship get a little perspective  see these theyre all over the place on every deck  gateways to history  but not just any old history  hers time windows  deliberately arranged along the life of one particular woman  a space ship from the 51st century stalking a woman from the 18th  why who is she  jean antoinette poisson  known to her friends as reinette one of the most accomplished women who ever lived  so she got plans on being queen then  no hes already got a queen shes got plans on being his mistress  oh i get it camilla  i think this is the night they met  the night of the yew tree ball  in no time flat shell get herself established as his official mistress with her own rooms at the palace  even her own title madame de pompadour  queen must have loved her  oh she did they

there was a lot of damage  ion storm 82 systems failure  that ship hasnt moved in over a year whats taken you so long  we did not have the parts  always comes down to that doesnt it the parts  what happened to the crew where are they we did not have the parts  there shouldve been over 50 people on your ship where did they go we did not have the parts   oh    you didnt have the parts so you used the crew  the crew   we found a camera with an eye in it  and there was a heart wired into machinery  its just doing what its programmed to  repairing the ship any way it can with whatever it can find  no one told it the crew werent on the menu  what did you say the flight deck smelled of   someone cooking   flesh plus heat  barbecue  but what are you doing here  youve opened up time windows that takes colossal energy  why come here you couldve gone to your repair yard  instead you come to  one more part is required  then why havent you taken it  she is incomplete  what so thats the plan then  you just keep opening up more and more time windows scanning her brain checking if shes done yet  why her  if youve got all of history to choose from why specifically her  we are the same  we are not the same we are in no sense the same  we are the same get out of here get out of here this instant reinette no  its back on the ship rose take mickey and arthur  dont approach it just watch what it does arthur good name for a horse youre not keeping the horse  i let you keep mickey now go go go  you must trust me i need to find out what theyre looking for theres only one way to do that  wont

cleopatra    oh cleopatra he mentioned her once yeah but he called her cleo mickey  you are in my memories you walk among them  if theres anything you dont want me to see just imagine a door and close it i wont look  actually theres a door just there you might want to close  actually several  to walk among the memories of another living soul do you ever get used to this  i dont make a habit of it  how can you resist what age are you  so impertinent a question so early in the conversation  how promising not my question  theirs youre 23  and for some reason that means youre not old enough  sorry you might find old memories reawakening side effect  oh such a lonely childhood  itll pass stay with me  oh doctor so lonely  so very very alone  what do you mean alone youve never been alone in your life  when did you start calling me doctor  such a lonely little boy  lonely then and lonelier now  how can you bear it how did you do that  a door once opened may be stepped through in either direction  oh doctor  my lonely doctor    dance with me i cant  dance with me  this is the night you dance with the king  then first i shall make him jealous  i cant doctor  doctor who  its more than just a secret isnt it  what did you see  that there comes a time time lord  when every lonely little boy must learn how to dance  what is this whats going on doctor  rose  theyre going to chop us up just like the crew  theyre going to chop us and stick us all over their stupid space ship  and wheres the doctor wheres the precious doctor now  been gone for flippin hours thats where he is you are compatible  well you might want to think about that you really really might because me and mickey  we didnt come here alone oh no and trust me you wouldnt want  to mess with our designated driver  ever heard of the daleks remember them  they had a name for our friend  they had myths about him and a name  they called him the     i could have danced all night i could have danced all night      they called him the     and still have begged for more   i could have spread my wings   and done a thousand   have you met the french   my god they know how to party   well look at what the cat dragged in the oncoming storm  ooh you sound just like your mother what have you been doing where have you been  well among other things i think i just invented the banana daiquiri a couple of centuries early  dyou know theyd never even seen a banana before  always take a banana to a party rose bananas are good  oh brilliant  its you  youre my favourite you are  you are the best you know why  cos youre so thick  youre mr thick thick thicketty thick face from thick town thickania  and sos your dad  do you know what they were scanning reinettes brain for  her mileometer  they wanted to know how old she is  know why cos this ship is 37 years old  and they think when reinette is 37 when shes complete then her brain will be compatible  cos thats what youre missing isnt it mmm the command circuit from your computer  your ship needs a brain  and for some reason god knows what only the brain of madame de pompadour will do  the brain is compatible  compatible  if you believe that then you probably believe this is a glass of wine  multi grade anti oil  if it moves it doesnt  right you two thats enough lying about  time we got the rest of the ship turned off  those things safe yep safe  safe and thick way i like em  ok all the time windows are controlled from here  need to close them all down zeus plugs where are my zeus plugs  had them a minute ago i was using them as castanets  why didnt they just open a time window to when she was 37  amount of damage in these circuits they did well to hit the right century trial and error after that  the windows arent closing  why wont they close  whats that i dunno  incoming message from who  report from the field one of them must still be out there with reinette  thats why i cant close the windows theres an override  oh that was a bit clever  right many things about this are not good  message from one of your little friends anything interesting  she is complete it begins  whats happening  one of them must have found the right time window now its time to send in the troops  and this time theyre bringing back her head  madame de pompadour   please dont scream or anything  we havent got a lot of time i have come to warn you that they will be here in five years  five years some time after your 37th birthday  i cant give you an exact date its a bit random but theyre coming  its gonna happen  in a way  for us  its already happening  im sorry its hard to explain the doctor does this better  then be exact and i will be attentive there isnt time  there are five years  for you i havent got five minutes  then also be concise  um  theres a  vessel  a ship a sort of sky ship  and its full of  well you  different bits of your life in different rooms all jumbled up i told you it was complicated sorry  there is a vessel in your world  where the days of my life are pressed together like the chapters of a book so that he may step from one  to the other without increase of age  while i weary traveller must always take the slower path  he was right about you  so in five years these creatures will return  what can be done the doctor says keep them talking  theyre kind of programmed to respond to you  now you wont be able to stop them but you might be able to delay them a bit until  until the doctor can get there  hes coming then he promises  but he cannot make his promises in person  hell be there when you need him thats the way  its got to be its the way it has always been  the monsters and the doctor  it seems you cannot have one without the other  tell me about it  the thing is you werent supposed to have either  those creatures are messing with history  none of this was ever supposed to happen to you supposed to happen  what does that mean  it happened child and i would not have had it any other way  one may tolerate a world of demons for the sake of an angel  rose rose  rose  the time window where shes 37  weve found it right under our noses  no you cant go in there  the doctor will go mad  so this is his world  screaming what was that the time window  the doctor fixed an audio link those screams  is that my future  yes im sorry  then i must take the slower path  reinettes voice are you there can you hear me  i need you now you promised the clock on the mantel is broken it is time  thats my voice rose come on weve got to go  theres a problem give me a moment  are you ok no i am very afraid  but you and i both know dont we rose  the doctor is worth the monsters  doctor doctor  people scream  doctor  we must go no one is coming to help us  you are complete you will come  you found it then they knew i was coming theyve blocked it off  where are we going the teleport has limited range  we must have proximity to the time portal  your words mean nothing  you are nothing  i dont get it how come they got in there they teleported you saw them as long as the ship  and the ballroom are linked their short range teleports will do the trick  well go in the tardis i cant use the tardis were part of events now cant we just smash through  hyperplex this side plate glass the other wed need a truck  we dont have a truck i know we dont have a truck well weve got to try something  no smash the glass smash the time window thered be no way back  could everyone just calm down please  such a commotion such distressing noise  kindly remember that this is versailles  this is the royal court and we are french  i have made a decision  and my decision is no  i shall not be going with you today  i have seen your world i have no desire to set foot there again  we do not require your feet  all scream  you think i fear you  but i do not fear you even now  you are merely the nightmare of my childhood  the monster from under my bed  and if my nightmare can return to plague me then rest assured so will yours  horse neighs  horse gallops in distance  madame de pompadour  you look younger ever day  what the hell is going on  oh  this is my lover the king of france  yeah well im the lord of time  and im here to fix the clock  forget it its over  for you and for me  talk about seven years bad luck  try three thousand  what happened  where did the time window go  hows he gonna get back  the link with the ship is broken  no way back  you dont have the parts  how many ticks left in that clockwork heart  a day an hour its over  accept that  im not winding you up  you all right  whats happened to them  theyve stopped  they have no purpose now  we cant fly the tardis without him  how is he going to get back  you know all their names dont you  i saw that in your mind  the name of every star  whats in a name names are just titles titles dont tell you anything  like the doctor  like madame de pompadour  i have often wished to see those stars a little closer  just as you have i think  from time to time  in saving me you trapped yourself  did you know that would happen  pretty much yet still you came  yeah i did didnt i  catch me doing that again  there were many doors between my world and yours  can you not use one of the others  when the mirror broke the shock wouldve severed all the links with the ship  therell be a few more broken mirrors and torn tapestries around here im afraid  wherever there was a time window  ill ill pay for any damage  thats a thought im going to need money always been a bit vague about money   where do you get money  so here you are  my lonely angel  stuck on the slow path with me  yep the slow path  heres to the slow path  its a pity i think i would have enjoyed the slow path  well im not going anywhere  oh arent you  take my hand  it is not a copy it is the original  i had it moved here and was exact in every detail  the fireplace  the fireplace from your bedroom  when did you do this  many years ago  in the hope that a door once opened may some day open again  one never quite knows when one needs ones doctor  it appears undamaged do you think it will still work  you broke the bond with the ship when you moved it  which means it was off line when the mirror broke thats what saved it  but the link is basically physical  and its still physically here  which might just mean if im lucky  if im very very very very lucky    a ha what loose connection  need to get a man in wish me luck  no  madame de pompadour  still want to see those stars  more than anything gimme two minutes pack a bag  am i going somewhere  go to the window pick a star any star  how long did you wait  always wait 512 hours  whereve you been explain later into the tardis with you in a sec  reinette are you there reinette  reinette  oh hello  you just missed her  shell be in paris by six  oh  good lord  she was right  she said you never looked a day older  so many years since i saw you last but not a day of it on your face  she spoke of you many times  often wished you would visit again  you know how women are  horse neighs  and there she goes  leaving versailles for the last time  only 43 when she died  too young  too young  illness took her in the end  she always did work too hard  what does she say  of course  quite right  why her  why did they think they could repair the ship with the head of madame de pompadour  well probably never know  theres massive damage in the computer memory decks it probably got confused  the tardis can close down the time windows now the droids have gone  should stop it causing any more trouble  you all right  im always all right  come on rose time you showed me round the rest of this place  my dear doctor  the path has never seemed more slow and yet i fear i am nearing its end  reason tells me that you and i are unlikely to meet again but i think i shall not listen to reason  i have seen the world inside your head and know that all things are possible  hurry though my love  my days grow shorter now and i am so very weak  godspeed my lonely angel  so this is london an alternative to our world  where everythings the same but a little bit different  loads of people are disappearing  its been going on for months  what are they all doing its the earpieces    the prototype has passed every test sir its working  ive seen them before   what are they  a skin of metal and a body that will never age    bbc 2006
