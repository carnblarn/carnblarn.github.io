laughter  so biff said im going swimming oh i was all ready trunks and everything nose plug  he had this little nose plug you shouldve seen him  i went marching up to the lifeguard and he was a shamboni you know those big foreheads  great big forehead  and i said wheres the pool  and he said the pool is abstract  it wasnt a real pool  it was a concept and you wore a nose plug i was like this  mmmwheres the pool  laughter  im just a secondyear student  but i wrote a paper on the lost moon of poosh  professor hobbes read it liked it took me on as a researcher  just for the holidays well i

enough space dont you  yeah  i had a friend who went to a different universe  oh whats this chicken or beef  i think its both  so this is midnight dyou see  bombarded by the sun xtonic rays raw galvanic radiation  dee dee next slide  its my pet project  actually im the first person to research this because you see  the history is fascinating  because there is no history  theres no life in this entire system there couldnt be  moved in noone had come here in all eternity  no living thing  but how dyou know  i mean if noone can go outside  oh his imagination here we go hes got a point though exactly  we look upon this world through glass safe inside our metal box  even the leisure palace was lowered down from orbit  and here we are now crossing midnight  but never touching it  rattling  weve stopped  have we stopped  are we there  we cant be its too soon  they dont stop crusader vehicles never stop  if you could just return to your seats its just a small delay  maybe just a pit stop hostess whats going on  theres no pit to stop in ive been on this expedition 14 times they never stop  evidently we have stopped so theres no point in denying it  laughing weve broken down  thanks jethro in the middle of nowhere thats enough stop it  ladies and gentlemen and variations thereupon were just experiencing a short  delay the driver needs to stabilise the engine feeds  its perfectly routine so if you could just stay in your seats no sir could you please  there you go engine expert two ticks sorry sir if you could sit down  youre not supposed to be in there if you could return  company insurance lets get an early assessment so whats the problem driver joe  were stabilising the engine feeds wont take long  um no cos thats the engine feed that light there and its fine  and its a micropetrol engine so stabilising doesnt make sense does it sorry  im a doctor im very clever so whats wrong  we just stopped look all systems fine and everythings working but were not moving  youre right no faults and who are you  claude im the mechanic trainee  nice to meet you ive sent a distress signal they should dispatch a rescue truck top speed  how long till they get here about an hour  well since were waiting  shall we take a look outside just  lift the screens a bit  its 100 xtonic out there wed be vaporised  no those windows are finitoglass theyd give you a couple of minutes oh go on live a little  they chuckle in glee  wow  ohhh that is beautiful  look at all those diamonds  poisoned by the sun noone can ever touch them  joe you said we took a detour  just 40 kliks to the west is that a recognised path  no its new the computer worked it out on automatic  so were the first  this piece of ground  noones ever been here before  not in the whole of recorded history  did you just  no sorry nothing what did you see  just there that ridge  likea shadow just for a second  what sort of shadow beeping  xtonic rising  shields down  look look there he is there he is look there where what was it  like just something shifting something sort of  dark like it wasrunning  running which way  towards us  doctor back to your seat and not a word rescues on its way  if you could close the door thank you  what did they say did they tell you what is it whats wrong  oh just stabilising happens all the time  i dont need this im on a schedule this is completely unnecessary  back to your seats thank you  excuse me doctor  but theyre micropetrol engines arent they  now dont bother the man my father was a mechanic  micropetrol doesnt stabilise what does stabilise mean  well bit of flimflam dont worry theyre sorting it out  so its not the engines just a little pause thats all  how much air have we got professor its fine what did he say nothing  are we running out of air i was just speculating  is that right miss are we running out of air is that what the captain said  if you could remain calm how much air have we got mum stop it  everything is under control doesnt look like it to me  well he said it its fine the air is on a circular filter  he started it everyone  all talk at once  quiet  silence falls  thank you now if youd care to listen to my good friend dee dee  oh  um  its just that well the airs stay breathing for ten years  there you go  and ive spoken to the captain i can guarantee you everythings fine  metallic knocking  what was that  it must be the metal were cooling down its just settling rocks could be rocks falling  what i want to know is how long do we have to sit here  metallic knocking  what is that someones out

metallic knocking  what the hell is making that noise  im sorry but the light out there is xtonic  that means it would destroy any living thing in a splitsecond  it is impossible for someone to be outside  metallic knocking  what the hell is that then  sir you really should get back to your seat  hello  metallic knocking  knock knock  its moving  rattling  its trying the door  there is no it

the ground is fixed its solid  weve got torches everyone take a torch theyre in the back of the seats  oh jethro sweetheart come here  never mind me what about her  what happened to the seats who did that theyve been ripped up  its all right its all right its all right its over  were still alive look the walls still intact dyou see  joe claude were safe  driver joe can you hear me  im not getting any response the intercom must be down  highpitched screeching  what happened what was that is it the driver have we lost the driver  the cabins gone dont be ridiculous  it cant be gone how can it be gone well you saw it  there was nothing there like it was ripped away what are you doing  thats better bit of light thank you molto bene dyou know what youre doing  the cabins gone youd better leave that wall alone the cabin cant be gone  no its safe any rupture would automatically seal itself  but something sliced it off  youre right the cabins gone but if it gets separated  it loses integrity  im sorry theyve been reduced to dust  the driver and the mechanic but they sent a distress signal  help is on its way they saved our lives  were gonna get out of here i promise were still alive and theyre gonna find us  doctor look at her  right yes sorry have we got a medical kit  why wont she turn around  whats her name silvestry mrs sky silvestry  sky can you hear me  are you all right  can

is  3341 wow 3341 wow  thats impossible thats impossible she couldnt repeat all that she couldnt repeat all that  tell her to stop tell her to stop shes driving me mad shes driving me mad  make her stop make her stop  stop her staring at me shut her up sky repeats all they say  both im telling you whatever your name is  stop it stop it  whats wrong with her eyes whats wrong with her eyes  they all talk at once sky repeats everything  highpitched noise all fall silent  thats the backup system well  thats a bit better what about the rescue how longs it going to take about 60 minutes thats all  then i suggest we all calm down  this panic isnt helping  that poor woman is evidently in a state of selfinduced hysteria  we should leave her alone doctor i know  sky simultaneously says what he says doctor now step back  i think you should leave her  alone  both whats she doing how can she do that  shes talking with you and with me  oh my god biff whats she doing sky now talks at same time as everyone  shes repeating  at exactly the same time thats impossible  theres not even a delay ohh man that is weird  i think you should all be very very quiet have you got that  hows she doing it mrs cane please be quiet  but how can she do that shes got my voice shes got my words  sweetheart be quiet just hush now hush  shes doing it to me just stop it all of you  stop it please  now then sky are you sky  is sky still in there  mrs silvestry  you know exactly what im going to say how are you doing that  roast beef  bananas  the medusa cascade  bang  rose tyler martha jones donna noble tardis  shamble bobble dibble dooble  oh doctor youre so handsome yes i am thank you  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o  first she repeats then she catches up whats the next stage  next stage of what  but thats not her is it thats not mrs silvestry any more  i dont think so no  i think  the more we talk the more she learns  now im all for education but in this case  maybe not lets justmove back come on come with me  everyone get back all of you as far as you can  doctor make her stop  val come on come to the back stop looking at her  everyone come on   the rescue arrives  and shes not exactly strong look at her all shes got is our voices  i cant look at her its those eyes  we must not look at goblin men  whats that supposed to mean its a poem christina rossetti  we must not look at goblin men we must not buy their fruits  who knows upon what soil they fed their hungry thirsty roots  actually i dont think thats helping  shes not a goblin or a monster shes just a very sick woman  maybe thats why it went for her there is no it  think about it that knocking it went all the way round the bus till it found her  and she was the most scared out of all of us  maybe thats what it needed  thats how it got in for the last time  nothing can live on the surface of midnight  professor im glad youve got a definition of life in the universe  but perhaps the universe has got ideas of its own mm  now trust me ive got previous  i think there might well be some  consciousness inside mrs silvestry but maybe shes still in there  and its our job to help her well you can help her  im not going near no ive got to stay back  if shes copying us maybe the final stage is becoming us  i dont want her becoming me or things could get a lot worse  oh like youre so special as it happens yes i am  so thats decided we stay back and we wait  when the rescue ship comes we can get her to hospital  we should throw her out  i beg your pardon  can we do that dont be ridiculous that thing whatever it is  killed the driver and the mechanic and i dont think shes finished yet  she cant even move look  look at her eyes  she killed joe and she killed claude and were next  shes still doing it just stop it  stop talking stop it  biff dont sweetheart she wont stop  we cant throw her out though we cant even open the doors  noone is getting thrown out  yes we can  cos theres an air pressure seal  like when you opened the cabin door you werent pulled out you had a couple of seconds  cos it takes the pressurewall about six seconds to collapse  well six seconds exactly  thats enough time to throw someone out  thanks dee dee just what we needed would it kill her outside  i dont know but shes got a body now it would kill the physical  i wouldnt risk the cabin door twice but weve got that one  all we need to do is grab hold of her and throw her out now listen  a brand new lifeform over there  and if its come inside to discover us than whats it found  this little bunch of humans what dyou amount to  a murder cos this is where you decide  you decide who you are  could you actually murder her any of you  really  or are you better than that  id do it so would i and me  i think we should what i want her out you cant say that  im sorry but you said it yourself doctor she is growing in strength  thats not what i said i want to go home im sorry i want to be safe  youll be safe any minute now the rescue truck is on its way  what happens then doctor  if it takes that thing back to the leisure palace if that thing reaches civilisation what if it spreads  no when we get back to the base ill be there to contain it  you havent done much so far youre just standing with the rest of us shes dangerous  its my job to see this vessel is safe we should get rid of her  now hang on i think perhaps were all going a little bit too far  at last thank you two people are dead  dont make it a third  jethro what dyou say im not killing anyone thank you  hes just a boy what so i dont get a vote  there isnt a vote its not happening ever  if you try to throw her out that door youll have to get past me first  ok fine by me  ohh now youre being stupid just think about it  could you take someone and throw them out of that door calling me a coward  who put you in charge anyway im sorry butyoure a doctor of what exactly  he wasnt even booked in rest of you tickets in advance he just turned up out of the blue  where from  im justtravelling im a traveller thats all like an immigrant  who were you talking to before you got on board who was that  just donna my friend what were you saying to her hasnt even told us his name  thing is doctor youve been loving this oh jethro not you  no but ever since all the trouble started youve been loving it  it has to be said you do seem to have a certainglee  all right im interested yes i cant help it  cos whatevers inside her its brand new and thats fascinating what you wanted this to happen  no and you were talking to her all on your own before the trouble  right at the front you were talking to that sky woman the two of you together i saw you we all did  you went into the cabin what were you saying to her i was just talking saying what  you called us humans like youre not one of us  he did thats what he said and the wiring he went into that panel and opened up the wiring  that was after but how did you know what to do because im clever  i see well that makes things clear  and what are we then idiots thats not what i meant  if youre clever then what are we youve looked down on us from the moment we walked in  even if he goes hes practically volunteered oh come on just listen to yourself please  dyou mean  we throw him out as well  if we have to  look just  right sorry yes hold on just  i know youre scared and so am i look at me i am  but we have all got to calm down and cool off and think  perhaps you could tell us your name  what does it matter then tell us  john smith your real name  hes lying look at his face his eyes are the same as hers  why wont you tell us hes been lying to us right from the start  noones called john smith come off it now listen to me right now  you need me all of you if were going to get out of this then you need me  so you keep saying youve repeated yourself more than her  if anyones in charge it should be the professor hes the expert mum just stop look  you keep out of this jethro look at her  shes stopped  when did she no she hasnt shes still doing it  she looks the same to me  no shes stopped look im talking and shes not  what about me look look at that shes not doing me shes let me go  mrs silvestry  nor me nothing  sky what are you doing  shes still doing him  doctor its you shes only copying you  why me why are you doing this  she wont leave him alone dyou see i said so shes with him  theyre together how dyou explain it doctor  if youre so clever i dont know  sky stop it  i said stop it just stop it  look at the two of them  mrs silvestry  im trying to understand  youve captured my speech what for  what dyou need  you need my voice in particular  the cleverest voice in the room  why cos im the only one who can help  ohh id love that to be true but your eyes  theyre saying something else  listen to me whatever you want if its life  or form or consciousness or voice you dont have to steal it  you can find it without hurting anyone  and ill help you  thats a promise  so  what dyou think do we have a deal do we have a deal  hold on did she she spoke first  she cant have she did she spoke first  oh look at that  im ahead of you oh look at that im ahead of you  did you see she spoke before he did definitely  hes copying her  doctor whats happening  sky i think its moved i think its moved  i think its letting me go i think its letting me go

leave her alone  shes safe isnt she  jethro its let her go hasnt it  looks like it professor  id say from observation  the doctor cant move  and when she was possessed she couldnt move so  well there we are then  now the only problem weve got is this doctor  its inside his head its inside his head  it killed the driver it killed the driver  and the mechanic and the mechanic  and now it wants us  and now it wants us i said so  in the dark and the cold  and the cold and the diamonds and the diamonds  until you came until you came bodies so hot  bodies so hot with blood  with blood and pain and pain make him stop oh my god someone make him stop  but shes saying it and you can shut up its not him its her hes just repeating  but thats what the thing does it repeats  let her talk what do you know fat lot of good youve been  just let her explain  i think  i mean from what ive seen it repeats then it synchronises then it goes on to the next stage  and thats exactly what the doctor said would happen  what and youre on his side no  the voice is the thing and shes the voice  she stole it look at her  its not possessing him its draining him shes got his voice  thats not true it cant be i saw it pass into him i saw it with my own eyes so did i  you didnt it went from her to him you saw it didnt you  i dont know oh dont be stupid jethro of course you did  i supposehe was right next to her everyone saw it  but youre just making it up  i know what i saw and i saw her stealing his voice  shes as bad as him someone shut her up i think you should be quiet dee  im only saying and thats an order  youre making a fool of yourself  pretending youre an expert in mechanics and hydraulics  when i can tell you you are nothing more than average at best now shut up  thats how he does it thats
