and cold lovely  martha have you met my friend  is that  oh my god thats the statue of liberty  gateway to the new world  give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free  thats so brilliant ive always wanted to go to new york  i mean the real new york not the new new new new new one  well theres the genuine article  so good they named it twice mind you it was new amsterdam originally  harder to say twice  no wonder it didnt catch on  new amsterdam newamsterdam  wonder what year it is cos look the empire state building its not even finished yet work in progress  theyve still got a couple of floors to go and if i know my history that makes the date somewhere around  november 1st 1930  youre getting good at this  nearly 80 years ago  its funny cos you see those old newsreels all in black and white like its so far away  but here we are  its real its now  cmon then you where do you wanna go first  i think our detour just got longer  hooverville mystery deepens whats hooverville   if youre blue and you dont know where to go to   herbert hoover 31st president of the usa came to power a year ago  up till then new york was a boomtown the roaring twenties  and then the wall street crash yeah  when was that 1929 yup the whole economy wiped out overnight  thousands of people unemployed  all of a sudden the huddled masses doubled in number with nowhere to go  so they ended up here in central park  what they actually live in the park  in the middle of the city   lost their jobs  couldnt pay the rent they lost everything  there are places like this all over america and noones helping them  you only come to hooverville when theres no where else to go  you thieving low life  all morning i wait in the bread line for a single loaf i didnt touch it  cut that out cut it out right now  he stole my bread thats enough  did you take it  i dont know what happened he just went crazy  thats enough  now think real careful before you lie to me  im starving solomon  we all starving  and we all got family somewhere  no stealing and no fighting you know the rules  thirteen years ago i fought in the great war a lot of us did  and the only reason we got through was because we stuck together  no matter how bad things get we still act like human beings  its all weve got  come on  i suppose that makes you the boss around here  and er who might you be hes the doctor im martha  a doctor  well we got stockbrokers  weve got a lawyer but youre the first doctor  the neighbourhood gets classier by the day  how many people live here any one time hundreds  no place else to go but i will say this about hooverville  were a truly equal society  black white all the same all starving  so youre welcome both of you  but tell me doctor youre a man of learning right explain this to me  that there is going to be the tallest building in the world  how come they can do that  and weve got people starving in the heart of manhattan  hoist  im telling ya the men wont stand for it  i mean are you out of your mind  i got 500 men working seven days a week theyre flat out and you want us to go faster  the new masters demand it  but were on schedule whats the problem another month and well be done  the mast on this building needs extra work completed by tonight  tonight no way its impossible  thats an order yeah  well one word from me and every man on this site stops work  so go on tell your masters that  if thats your attitude i think you should tell them yourself  yeah well i aint afraid of no man in a suit  so these new bosses whats their names  i think you could say theyre from out of town italians  bit further than that  how much further  beyond your imagination  whats that supposed to mean who are they  mr diagoras who are we working for  behold your masters  what the hell  i have been summoned explain  explain  it can talk how does it talk  and what the hell are they youve gotta be kidding me  im sorry my lord but this man is refusing to complete the work  then we must replace him  is anybody gonna tell me what the hell is happening here use him  take him for the final experiment  whats going on let go  let go of me let go of me get off me  the empire state building must be completed in time  it will be trust me  labour is cheap and that man can be replaced  the plan must not fail  we calculate the gamma strike has accelerated  we need more bodies immediately  yes master  so men going missing is this true  its true all right  but what does missing mean  people must come and go here all the time its not like anyone keeps a register come on in  this is different  in what way someone takes them  at night  we hear something someone calls out for help  by the time we get there theyre gone  like theyve vanished into thin air  and youre sure someones taking them  doctor when youve got next to nothing you hold on to the little you got  a knife a blanket you take it with you  you dont leave bread uneaten a fire still burning have you been to the police  yeah we tried that another deadbeat goes missing big deal  so the question is whos taking them and what for  solomon mr diagoras is here  i need men volunteers ive got a little work for you  and you sure look like you could use the money  what is the money a dollar a day  whats the work  a little trip down the sewers  got a tunnel collapsed needs clearing and fixing any takers  a dollar a day is a slave wage  and men dont always come back up do they accidents happen  what sort of accidents  you dont need the work thats fine anybody else  enough with the questions  ah no no no im volunteering  ill go  ill kill you for this  anybody else  turn left go about half a mile follow tunnel 273  the falls right ahead of you you cant miss it when do we get our dollar  when you come back up and if we dont come back up  then i got noone to pay  dont worry well be back  lets hope so  just gotta stick together  easy to get lost its like a huge rabbit warren  could hide an army down here  so what about you frank  youre not from around these parts are you you can talk  no im tennessee born and bred  so how come youre here  oh my daddy died  momma couldnt afford to feed us all so im the oldest  up to me to feed myself  so i put on my coat hitched up here on the railroads  theres a whole lot of runaways in the camp  younger than me from all over  missouri oklahoma texas  solomon keeps a look out for us  so what about you  youre a long way from home  yeah im just a hitcher too  you stick with me youll be all right  this diagoras bloke who is he  couple of months ago he was just another foreman now seems like hes running most of manhattan  howd he manage that then  these are strange times  a man can go from being the king of the hill to the lowest of the low overnight  guess for some folks it works the other way round whoa  is it radioactive or something  its gone off whatever it is  and youve got to pick it up  shine your torch through it  composite organic matter  martha medical opinion  its not human i know that  no  its not  and ill tell you something else  we must be at least half a mile in i dont see any signs of a collapse do you  so why did mr diagoras send us down here  where are we now whats up above  well were right underneath manhattan  and here the crowning glory of the empire state building the mast itself   its a beautiful thing sir  and every single one of us is proud of it  my wife says its like a spire reaching into heaven  except the gates of heaven need a little decoration  these plates have gotta be fixed to the mast right to the base itself  thats ok that shouldnt take too long  but the work has gotta be finished tonight  are you trying to kill us  dont argue with me  but sir the men cant work up there at night its freezing  your hands go numb you lose your grip you fall  you dont get it  if you wont work  i can replace you like that  now take those panels  and get going  what sort of metal is this anyway  dont ask questions just go  i dont care how cold it is how tired you are just get out there and finish the job  the conductor must be complete for our plan to succeed  unemployment is such an incentive  itll get done dont worry  daleks have no concept of worry  yeah  well lucky you  this day is ending  humankind is weak you shelter from the dark  and yet you have built all this  thats progress gotta move with the times or you get left behind  my planet is gone  destroyed in a great war  yet versions of this city stand throughout history  the human race always continues  weve had wars  ive been a soldier myself  and i swore then id survive no matter what  you have rare ambition  oh i want to run this city whatever it takes  by any means necessary  you think like a dalek  ill take that as a compliment  this human is our best option  bring him to me  your loyalty will be rewarded come with me  prepare the laboratory the final experiment will begin  we obey  where are we going you have been summoned by our leader  oh and about time too  i bring you the human i take it youre in charge  correct i am dalek sec  leader of the cult of skaro  then my lord sec i am honoured to meet you ever since you first made contact with me  transmitting your thoughts into the corners of my mind tempting me with such images such ideas  oh

im your partner im your friend  were way beyond half a mile  theres no collapse nothing  that diagoras bloke was he lying  looks like it so why did he want people to come down here  solomon take these

the dalek imperative  daleks are supreme humans are weak  but there are millions of humans and only four of us  if we are supreme why are we not victorious  the cult of skaro was created by the emperor for this very purpose  to imagine new ways of survival  but we must remain pure  no dalek thay  us to extinction  we must adapt to survive  you have all made sacrifices  and now i will sacrifice myself  for the greater cause  for the future of dalekkind now bring me the human  but i dont understand what do you mean get offa me  behold the true dalek form  now join with me  no get
