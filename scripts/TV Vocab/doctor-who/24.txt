loud voice for a dead bloke  if living things can become drawings then maybe drawings can become living things uh  chloes real dad is dead but not the one who visits her in her nightmares  that dad

speaking to you  the entity that is using this human child  i request parlez in compliance with the shadow proclamation  i dont care about shadows or parlezes  so what do you care about  i want my friends  youre lonely i know  identify yourself  i am one of many  i travel with my brothers and sisters  we take an endless journey a thousand of your lifetimes  but now i am alone i hate it its not fair  and i hate it name yourself  isolus  youre isolus of course  our journey began in the deep realms when we were a family  whats that the isolus mother drifting in deep space  see she jettisons millions of fledgling spores  her children  the isolus are empathic beings of intense emotion  when theyre cast off from their mother  their need for each other is what sustains them  they need to be together they cannot be alone  our journey is long  the isolus children travel each inside a pod  they ride the heat and energy of solar tides  and it takes thousands and thousands of years for them to grow up  thousands of years just floating through space poor things  dont they go mad with boredom  we play  youplay  while they travel they play games  they use their ionic power to literally create makebelieve worlds in which to play  inflight entertainment it helps keep them happy  while theyre happy they can feed off each others love without it theyre lost  why did you come to earth  we were too close  thats a solar flare from your sun  would have made a tidal wave of solar energy that scattered the isolus pods  only i fell to earth  my brothers and sisters are left up there  and i can not reach them  so alone  your pod crashed where is it  my pod was drawn to heat  and i was drawn to chloe webber  she was like me  alone  she needed me and i her  you empathized with her  you wanted to be with her because she was alone like you i want my family  its not fair i understand you want to make a family  but you cant stay in this child its wrong  you cant steal any more friends for yourself i am alone  crash and growling im coming to hurt you  im coming trish how do you calm her what  when she has nightmares what do you do i what do you do i sing  start singing  growling chloe im coming   kookaburra sits in the old gum tree   merry merry king of the bush is he  singing and growling continue  growling fades   kookaburra gay your life must be  it came to her because she was lonely  oh chloe im sorry  chloe usually got the brunt of his temper when hed had a drink  the day he crashed the car i thought we were free i thought it was over  did you talk to her about it  i didnt want to  but maybe thats why chloe feels so alone  because she has these terrible dreams about her dad but she cant talk to you about them  her and the isolus   two lonely kids who needed each other  it wont stop will it doctor  itll just keep pulling kids in  its desperate to be loved  its used to a pretty big family how big  say around four billion  the queue started a week ago  for those desperate enough to be inside  there are lots of them  were expecting a capacity crowd of 80000 for this evenings opening ceremony theres been  we need that pod  it crashed wont it be destroyed  its been sucking in heat that should keep it fit to launch  it should have a weak energy signature the tardis can trace  once we find it then we can stop the isolus  shes running a temperature  i cant go into that now kirsty  yes weve got a doctor  yes he said he can help her  we can scan for the same trace i picked up from the scribble creature just need to widen the field a bit  you knew the isolus was lonely before it told you how  i know what its like to travel a long way on your own give me the steinomagnetic  the thing in your left hand sounds like youre on its side  i sympathize thats all the isolus has caused a lot of pain for these people its a child  thats why it went to chloe hmm  feels to me like a temper tantrum cos it cant get its own way  its scared come on you were a kid once binary dot  yes and i know what kids can be like right littleterrors  gum hey ive got cousins kids cant have it all their own way  thats part of being a family and what about trying to understand them  easy for you to say you dont have kids  i was a dad once what did you say  i think were there  fear loneliness theyre the big ones rose  some terrible acts have been inspired by them  this isnt something that wants to conquer or destroy  theres a lot of things you need to get across this universe  warp drive wormhole refractors  do you know the thing you need most of all you need a hand to hold  no look im pointing  its the pod it is in the street  everythings coming up doctor  its about two inches across dull grey like a gulls egg very light  so these pods they travel from sun to sun using the heat yeah so its not all about love and stuff  doesnt the pod just need heat glass smashes  doctor  doctor  its ok ive taken all the pencils off her  leave me alone i want to be with chloe
