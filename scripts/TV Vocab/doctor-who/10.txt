escape  billions upon billions of them  ready to fix all the cuts and bruises in the whole world  but what they find first is a dead child  probably killed earlier that night  and wearing a gas mask  and they brought him back to life they can do that whats life  lifes easy a quirk of matter  natures way of keeping meat fresh  nothing to a nanogene one problem though  these nanogenes theyre not like the ones on your ship this lot have never seen a human being before  dont know what a human beings supposed to look like  all theyve got to go on is one little body  and theres not a lot left  but they carry right on they do what theyre programmed to do  they patch it up  cant tell whats gas mask and whats skull but they do their best  then off they fly off they go work to be done  cos you see now they think they know what people should look like  and its time to fix all the rest and they wont ever stop  they wont ever ever stop  the entire human race is gonna be torn down and rebuilt in the form of one terrified child  looking for its mother  and nothing in the world can stop it i didnt know  bombs drop in the distance  mummy mummy mummy mummy  rose  its bringing the gasmask people here  the ship thinks its under attack its calling the troops  standard protocol but the gasmask people arent troops  they are now this is a battlefield ambulance  the nanogenes dont just fix
