                doctor doctor look out  wheres he gone have you seen him there he is stop no  watch out  there there  low growling  water drips  low growls  thats what it did it went roar  and if you think that was the most exciting day of my life wait till you hear the rest  oh boy  so there i was with that thing going roar  here boy eat the food come on  look at the lovely food isnt that nice yes it is  get out of here quickly  who would like a porkie choppie then i said run  wrong one youve made it worse  you said blue i said not blue  hold on  ahhh  aaagh aaagh  hold on  dont i know you  tardis whirrs  you cant imagine it the doctors machine  the most beautiful sound in the world  that wasnt the first time i met the doctor and it certainly wasnt the last oh no  i just put that bit at the beginning because its a brilliant opening  this is the story of me and my encounters with alien life forms  but be warned  because it is gonna get scaaary  i need a remote control zoom  im having to do that with the lean scaaaary  but look dont worry cos its not just me sitting here talking oh no  thats ursula on camera hello  my good friend ursula blake on my brand new camera  that was my family home down there  i did try but theres two women live there now  theyre a bit severe  never mind but thats where it all started  cos thats when i first met the doctor  what was it i mustve been three or four years old  middle of the night i went downstairs  and there was thisman  what happened  elton tell me why was he there  i dunno still dont know  all those years ago  ok first things first  my name is elton not to be confused with  i left school i got a job transport manager for rita logistics  modest little haulage company perfectly normal life and then  it all went mad  two years ago i was in town  i was stocking up nothing special all the usual stuff  when all of a sudden  people scream  shop window dummies  come to life  i survived obviously  twelve months later im back in town  looking for a new suit when i hear this plane overhead  dong  but it wasnt over yet cos then christmas day  im in bed fast asleep nice and cosy when all of a sudden  like ptscccchhhh  im stuck in bed cos theres glass everywhere and i was barefoot  i had to invent this rudimentary pulley system just to reach my boots and by the time id done that  thats when it all started happening  thats how i met ursula his name is the doctor thats how i met victor kennedy  you stupid man  thats how i met jackie tyler you dont meet many eltons  and thats how i finally met the doctor  and realised the truth  i should say  this isnt my whole life  its not all spaceships and stuff  cos im into all sorts of things  i like football  i like a drink i like spain  and if theres one thing i really really love  then its jeff lynne and the electric light orchestra  cos you cant beat a bit of elo   the sun is shining in the sky   there aint a cloud in sight   its stopped raining   everybodys in the play   and dont you know its a beautiful day   hey hey hey   so  great big spaceship hanging over london imagine the theories  the internet went into meltdown  but i kept on digging  something was going on  oh yes and then one day on some obscure little blog  by someone called ursula blake it was like a chance in a million  it was him it was that man again but the photo was new it was taken on christmas day  but christmas just gone and he looked exactly the same his name is the doctor  doctor what thats all anyone knows  but christmas day i was taking photos all over the place  i went mad with it all spaceships and lasers and everything  we all went to trafalgar square that night cos everyone was celebrating just being alive  i snapped him in passing thats all he was just some bloke  i didnt realise he was significant until mr skinner pointed it out  whos mr skinner  oh theres a few of us  the inner sanctum all studying this doctor  ive seen him the doctor i swear to you  i saw him when i was a kid he was in my house and he was downstairs  dont tell me he looked exactly the same then as he does now yes  yes  oh my god you believe me  so thats how i met ursula all thanks to the doctor  turns out we read all the same sites and she only lived half a mile away  she was like a proper mate poor ursula  but like she said there was this little community the select few  all with their stories of the doctor  this little gang used to meet up underneath the old library on maccateer street  mr skinner first name colin but we always called him mr skinner  i dont know why we just did to me the doctor isnt a man  hes more a collection of archetypes  then there was bridget all these different doctors come and go  but the single constant factor is this fauxpolice box it keeps cropping up throughout history  she lived way up north but she travelled down just for the meetings  then there was bliss what im trying to do  is sum up the doctor what he means to us  she was ever so sweet bliss  bless bliss we used to say what he could represent and what he should represent  and what he  never wont represent sort of thing we should have a name  you know as a group  names are very important  what we need is a good strong name like a team something like  london investigation n detective agency  linda for short say it again  london investigation n detective agency  n fish n chips  rock n roll chakademus n pliers  linda oh i like it its not too solemn i like the n  were the men from linda and the women linda united  did you think of that on the spot no ive wanted to use it for years  i give you linda all linda  so wed all meet up every week  wed talk about the doctor for a bit  but after a while bridget started cooking  oh my god thats gorgeous  no really wow oh rest of you get your hands off  next thing you know mr skinner started his readings cos he was writing his own novel  thats the last time you ride the ghost train johnny franzetta now say your prayers  to be continued  noooo time went on we got to know each other better and better  i only started all this because my daughter disappeared  but it wasnt aliens that took her away  it was just drugs  i come down to london every week and i just keep looking for her  oh bridget   i gave my love a chicken   it had no bone   i gave my love a cherry   it had no stone    ive got a brand new pair of rollerskates   youve got a brandnew key   then it turned out that bridget could play the piano  and i confessed my love of elo next thing you know musical linda   you got me running going out of my mind   you got me thinking that im wasting my time   dont bring me down   just for fun   dont bring me down   your go  grooves your go  now careful mind the cables  and thats when it all changed  that tuesday night in march  thats when he arrived  lights thats when we met victor kennedy and the golden age was gone  so we meet at last  linda pleased to meet you sir im sorry was the music too loud  no no no i dont shake hands  back back i suffer from a skin complaint  exeema oh you mean eczema  oh this is worse much worse i blister to the touch back back all of you further further  thank you  sorry dont mind me asking but who are you  i am your salvation  thats the doctor thats really him  youve forgotten your purpose in life  you with your band and your cakes and your blubbing and all the while he still exists  the doctor look at him just look  move back move back all of you  wait for this bit the picture cuts out but the sound continues  listen just listen listen to the sound of the universe  sound of the tardis  thats  what is it whats wrong leave him  youve heard it before havent you  when when was it where where were you  id forgotten  till now  but it was that night  what night  i was just a kid  thats why i went downstairs  it woke me up  that noise tardis whirrs  but what is it  what does it mean that is the sound of his spaceship  right then homework using the torchwood files  we can look at the old databases in a completely new light  we are able to build up a more detailed profile of the doctor ive allocated tasks to each of you  id like you to careful watch the exeema  i would like you to complete your targets  well meet back here this time next week one step closer to catching the doctor  well dont just sit there move  um bliss it is bliss isnt it  yes could i have a word with you in private please  course you can yeah thank you  goodbye goodbye  better get to work lots to do  i never thought of it as work its what we always wanted though   to find the doctor yeah i suppose  girl screams  all of a sudden without anyone saying so we were working for victor kennedy  and we had to admit he was right his methods were much more rigorous  it felt like we were getting closer and closer to the doctor  mr kennedy yes  we were wondering no sign of bliss do you know where she is  yes didnt she tell you shes getting married she left a message  itll never last stupid girl come on back to work  but we did get lucky once a police box newlyarrived  it says newly arrived today in woolwich  well dont just stand there move move go go  but dont get excited thats where you came in  woolwich police box red bucket blue bucket  me so stupid etc  useless i just froze  you met him and you froze you stupid man  you cant hit me cos you dont touch you said so i can use this  use that cane on him and youll get one hell of a smack off me  and then a good kick is that completely understood mr kennedy  duly noted  ursula blake  most likely to fight back  right then well change tack well approach this sideways  if were to discover the truth about the doctor  then we should try to findher  when it comes to the doctors companion the torchwood files are strangely lacking  it seems the evidence has been corrupted something called bad wolf virus  at least weve got these photographs  theyre firsthand evidence elton  oh it was a london accent definitely shes from london  so we hit the streets we get out there  we take the photograph someones got to know who she is somewhere  yes but londons a big place i should know  my own daughters out there  bridget dont make this personal  i dont like to be touched literally or metaphorically i havent got the time  find me that girl go  now move  and so it began the impossible task   to scour the mean streets  to search a major capital city for an unknown girl  to hunt down that face in a seething metropolis of lost souls  to find that one girl in ten million  oh thats rose tyler she lives just down there  bucknall house number 48 her mothers jackie tyler nice family bit odd   dont you know its a beautiful new day   hey hey hey   oi jackie hello sweetheart  ill see you down the spinning

back there i think i did  and if you get your way might there be more little kisses between the two of you i think there might  i knew it thats brilliant  now dont get excited well see  woman screams in distance  infiltration went well cos jackie kept phoning up needing this and needing that  it was strange the amount of things that needed doing its like that flat was jinxed  romantic music plays its weird these fuses keep blowing  you must be near a substation cos then you get power surges  still there we go fixed  there we are little reward for my favourite handyman  oh well i shouldnt

mad  put your shirt back on  where is she  doesnt matter  im sorry  youd better go  actually  and thats when it struck me  funny the things you think of with your shirt off  but thats when i realised what was really important  never mind about rose  im not even gonna ask  and i will put my shirt back on because i am gonna go out and get us both a pizza  cos i reckon you need cheering up she goes swanning off and whos left to care about you eh  so i say nice bit of pizza well put the telly on nice and loud  well annoy that woman next door just you and me as proper mates yeah  mates go on  say yes  yes  all of a sudden a lot of things made sense  id got so lost in conspiracies and aliens and targets id been missing the obvious  cos i did like jackie  but i liked someone else even more   hey

i said get out  and leave me alone  and she was right its shameful we used that woman  i knew i couldnt trust you you broke cover you stupid little man you failed step five  i dont care about step five  cos its all gone wrong mr kennedy ever since you turned up  we used to come here every week and wed have a laugh  we were friends  no wonder they stopped coming i mean theres no bliss any more

form  better than that crude pink shape you call a body  what happened where am i  ursula is that you  thats mr skinner  what have you done to him ive absorbed him  colin is that you colin bridget my love  oh my god thats bridget  colin where are you im here bridget its all right  im close  youve absorbed them both  what about bliss where is she  muffled yelp what  i said you really dont want to know youve absorbed them  youre some sort of  absorbathon an absorbaling  an abzorbaloff  yes i like that let them go  im ordering you  let those people go  but they taste so sweet  just think about the doctor  oh how will he taste  all that experience all that knowledge  and if ive got to absorb jackie tyler to get to him then so be it  dont you dare  if i have to beat them out of you  no no please dont hit me  look at me im such a slow and clumsy beast  please dont hit me  well then give them back  what you mean like this  just one touch thats all it takes  no no  leave her alone dont touch me  oh elton im so sorry you cant touch me  ursula  most likely to fight back indeed  leave her alone  yes no thats not fair  she tastes like chicken  elton where are you  please  mr kennedy please  im asking you  im begging you  give her back to me i cant  once theyve been absorbed the process is irreversible  wait a minute  now ive been absorbed i can read his thoughts  oh my god  elton youre next get out of here  now youve seen him he cant let you go just run  go on never mind me get out  isnt she the clever one run elton  run save yourself boy run for your life  oh whats the matter  have you given up so soon  theres no point  where would i go  everything i ever wanted  has been absorbed oh elton dont say that  but its true  then join us join us little man  come on theres everlasting peace come on join us   dissolve into me  tardis whirrs  someone wants a word with you  youve upset my mum  a great big absorbing creature from outer space and youre having a go at me  noone upsets my mum at last  the greatest feast of all  the doctor interesting  some sort of absorbatrix  absorbaklon abzorbaloff  abzorbaloff yes is it me or is he a bit slitheen  not from raxacoricofallapatorius are you  no im not theyre swine  i spit on them i was born on their twin planet  really whats the twin planet of raxacoricofallapatorius clom  clom clom yes and ill return there victorious once i possess your travelling machine  well thats never gonna happen oh it will  youll surrender yourself to me doctor or this one dies  you see ive read about you doctor  ive studied you so passionate  so sweet you wouldnt let an innocent man die  and ill absorb him unless you give yourself to me  sweet maybe  passionate i suppose but dont ever mistake that for nice  do what you want  hell die doctor go on then  so be it mind you the others might have something to say others  hes right the doctors right we cant let him  oh mr skinner bridget pull  no for gods sake pull if its the last thing we ever do  bliss all of us together   come on pull  linda united  puuuull  elton the cane break it  my cane  ystupid man  oh no  what did i do the cane created a limitation field  now its broken he cant stop  the absorber is being absorbed by what  by the earth  byebye elton  byebye  who was she  that was ursula  and thats it  almost  because the doctor still had more to say  you dont remember do you and then he explained  that night all those years ago  there was a shadow in your house  a living shadow in the darkness  an elemental shade had escaped from the howling halls  i stopped it but  i wasnt in time to save her  im sorry  because that was the night my mother died  we forget because we must  so there you go  turns out ive had the most terrible things happen and the most brilliant things  and sometimes well i cant tell the difference   theyre all the same thing theyre just me  you know stephen king said once he said  salvation and damnation are the same thing  and i never knew what he meant  but i do now  cos the doctor might be wonderful but thinking back  i was having such a special time  just for a bit i had this nice little gang   ill tell you once more before i get off the floor   and they were destroyed  its not his fault  but maybe thats what happens if you touch the doctor  even for a second  i keep thinking of rose and jackie  and how much longer before they pay the price  oh now dont get all miserable  come on elton youve still got me  oh yeah  cos the doctor said he could do one last thing with his magic wand  if i can key into the absorption matrix and separate the last victim  its too late for total reconstruction but  elton fetch a spade  even then after all that  the doctor saved me one last time  here she is could be worse  at least ill never age  and it really is quite peaceful youd be surprised  its a relationship of sorts  we manage  weve even got a bit of a love life  oh lets not go into that  and i dont care what anyone thinks  i love her  aaah  but the thing is  there yare  ive even bought a remote zoom  but what i wanted to say is  yknow when youre a kid  they tell you its all grow up get a job get married get a house  have a kid and thats it  no  but the truth is the world is so much stranger than that  and so much darker  and so much madder  and so much better   theyre not safe theyre in the garden im begging you  in the last six days three of your children have been stolen  if we find the source of that power  theyre kids pictures now get out  chloe has a power shes using it to snatch the kids get out  if living things can become drawings  then maybe drawings can become living things    bbc 2006
