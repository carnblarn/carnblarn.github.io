                you are the weakest link  this isnt just a game theres something else going on  we have contestants outside the games the games continue  this is satellite five  all beaming down from here  my masters fear the doctor  tell me who they are  youre dead i saw you die  thats impossible they were destroyed obviously they survived  we have your associate you will obey or she will be exterminated   rose  yes doctor  im coming to get you  you know the doctor  you understand him you will predict his actions  i dont know even if i did i wouldnt tell you  predict predict predict  tardis detected in flight  launch missiles exterminate  you cant the tardis has no defences youll kill him  you have predicted correctly  we got incoming  the extrapolators working weve got a fullyfunctional force field try saying that when youre drunk  and for my next trick    rose get down  get down rose exterminate  aaaah  you did it  it feels like i havent seen you in years  i told you id come and get you i never doubted it i did you all right yeah you  not bad been better hey dont i get a hug oh come here i was talking to him  welcome home oh   i thought id never see you again  you were lucky that was a oneshot wonder it drained the gun of its power supply now its just junk  patience my brethren    you said they were extinct  one minute theyre the greatest threat in the universe then they vanish  they went off to fight a bigger war  the time war  i thought that was just a legend i was there  the war between the daleks and the time lords with the whole of creation at stake  my people were destroyed but took the daleks with them  i almost thought it was worth it  and now it turns out they died for nothing  theres thousands of them now we could hardly stop one  what are we gonna do  no good stood round here chinwagging  human race youd gossip all day  the daleks have got the answers lets go and meet the neighbours you cant go out there  exterminate exterminate  is that it  useless nul points  its all right come on out that force field can hold back anything almost anything  yes but i wasnt going to tell them that thanks sorry  do you know what they call me in the ancient legends of the dalek homeworld  the oncoming storm  you might have removed all your emotions but i reckon right down  deep in your dna theres one little spark left  and thats fear  doesnt it just burn when you face me  so tell me    how did you survive the time war  they survived through me  rose captain     this is the emperor of the daleks  you destroyed us doctor  the dalek race died in your inferno  but my ship survived  falling through time crippled but alive  i get it do not interrupt  do not interrupt do not interrupt  i think youre forgetting something im the doctor and if theres one thing i can do its talk  ive got five billion languages and youve no way of stopping me  so if anybodys gonna shut up its you  okeydoke so  where were we  we waited here in the dark space  damaged but rebuilding  centuries passed and we quietly infiltrated the systems of earth  harvesting the waste of humanity  the prisoners the refugees the dispossessed they all came to us  the bodies were filleted pulped sifted  the seed of the human race is perverted  only one cell in a billion was fit to be nurtured  so you created an army of daleks out of the dead  that makes them  half human  those words are blasphemy  do not blaspheme  do not blaspheme do not blaspheme  everything human has been purged  i cultivated pure and blessed dalek  since when did the daleks have a concept of blasphemy  i reached into the dirt and made new life  i am the god of all daleks  worship him  worship him worship him  theyre insane  hiding in silence for hundreds of years is enough to drive anyone mad  but its worse than that  driven mad by your own flesh    the stink of humanity  you hate your own existence  and that makes them more deadly than ever  were going you may not leave my presence  stay where you are  exterminate exterminate  exterminate  exterminate exterminate  exterminate  worship him worship him  exterminate exterminate  tardis whirrs  turn everything up all transmitters full power wide open now do it what does this do  stops daleks transmatting on board did you contact earth i tried to but they suspended our licence  cos we stopped the programmes then the planets defenceless  lynda what are you still doing on board  i told you to evacuate everyone  she wouldnt go i didnt wanna leave you  there werent enough shuttles anyway or i wouldnt be here  weve got 100 people stranded on floor zero  listen listen my names rodrick  i won the game wheres my money is anyone listening wheres my money  oh my god the fleet is moving  theyre on their way  purify the earth with fire  the planet will become my temple and we shall rise  this will be our paradise  dalek plan big mistake cos what have they left me with anyone  oh come on its obvious a great big transmitter this station  if i can change the signal sequence it anyone  you gotta be kidding give the man a medal a delta wave  a delta wave whats a delta wave  van cassadyne energy it fries your brain  stand in its way and your head gets barbecued  and this place can transmit a massive wave wipe out the daleks get started and do it then  but a wave this size building this big brain as clever as mine should take  three days  how long till the fleet arrive  with our force field they cant blast us out of the sky but that doesnt stop the daleks invading  do they know about the delta wave theyll have worked it out  they wanna stop the doctor so theyve got to get to level 500  i can concentrate the extrapolator on the top six levels 500 to 495  so theyll penetrate the station below that at level 494 and fight their way up  who are they fighting us and what are we fighting with  the guards had guns with bastic bullets enough to blow a dalek wide open theres five of us  rose you can help me i need all these wires stripping bare  right now theres four of us  then lets move it into the lift isolate the lift controls  ii just wanna say um  thanks  i suppose and ill do my best  me too  its been fun  but i guess this is goodbye  dont talk like that the doctors gonna do it you just watch him  rose    you are worth fighting for  i wish id never met you doctor  i was much better off as a coward  see you in hell  hes gonna be all right  isnt he  shouting and jeering  one last time  any more volunteers  theres an army about to invade this station  i need every last citizen to mount a defence  dont listen to him  there arent any daleks they disappeared thousands of years ago  thanks  as for the rest of you the daleks will enter the station at floor 494  and as far as i can tell theyll head up not down  but thats not a promise  so heres a few words of advice  keep quiet  and if you hear fighting up above if you hear us dying    then tell me that the daleks arent real  dont make a sound  lets go  suppose    what  nothing  you said suppose   no i was just thinking    and i mean obviously you cant but    youve got a time machine why not go back to last week and warn them  as soon as the tardis lands in that second i become part of events stuck in the timeline  yeah i thought itd be something like that  theres another thing the tardis could do it could take us away  we could leave  let history take its course  we go to marbella in 1989  yeah but youd never do that  no but you could ask  it never even occurred to you did it well  im just too good  whining  the delta waves started building how long does it need  is that bad  ok its bad how bad is it  rose tyler youre a genius  we can do it if i use the tardis to cross my own timeline    yes  hold that down and keep position whats it do  cancels the buffers if im  and im im brilliant  i might just save the world or rip it apart  id go for the first one me too ive just got to power up the game station hold on  doctor what are you doing   can i take my hand off its moving  doctor let me out  let me out  doctor let me out  this is emergency programme one  rose now listen this is important  if this message has activated then it can only mean one thing  we must be in danger and i mean fatal  im dead or about to die at any second with no chance of escape  no and thats ok hope its a good death  but i promised to look after you so the tardis is taking you home  i wont let you and i bet youre fussing and moaning now typical  but hold on and just listen a bit more  the tardis can never return for me  emergency programme one means im facing an enemy that should never get this machine  so this is what you do should do  let the tardis die  just let this old box gather dust  noone can open it noonell even notice it  let it become a strange little thing standing on a street corner  over the years the world will move on and the box will be buried  and if you want to remember me then you can do one thing  thats all one thing  have a good life  do that for me rose  have a fantastic life  you cant do this to me you cant  take me back take me back  no  come on fly  how do you fly   come on help me  i knew it  i was down clifton parade and i heard the engines  i thought theres only one thing that makes a noise like that  what is it  rose ive called up the internal laser codes  there should be a different number on every screen read them to me shes not here taking a leak  when she gets back tell her to read me the codes shes not coming back whered she go  just get on with your work  you took her home didnt you yeah  the delta wave is it ever gonna be ready  dalek voice tell him the truth doctor  there is every possibility the delta wave could be complete  but no possibility of refining it  the delta wave must kill every living thing in its path  with no distinction between human and dalek  all things will die  by your hand  doctor the range of this transmitter covers the whole earth  you would destroy daleks and humans together  if i am god  the creator of all things  then what does that make you doctor  there are colonies out there  the human race would survive in some shape or form but youre the only daleks in existence  the whole universe is in danger if i let you live  do you see jack  thats the decision ive got to make for every living thing  die as a human or live as a dalek  what would you do  you sent her home  shes safe  keep working but he will exterminate you  never doubted him never will  now you tell me god of all daleks cos theres one thing i never worked out the words bad wolf  spread across time and space everywhere drawing me in how did you manage that  i did nothing  oh come on theres no secrets now your worship  they are not part of my design  this is the truth of god  and its gone upmarket this place theyre doing little tubs of coleslaw now its not very nice  it tastes a bit sort of clinical  have you tried that new pizza place on minto road  whats it selling pizza  thats nice do they deliver  yeah  oh rose have something to eat  dying and theres nothing i can do  well like you said  but its not its now that fight is happening right now and hes fighting for us  for the whole planet and im just sitting here eating chips  listen to me god knows ive hated that man but right now i love him and do you know why  cos he did the right thing he sent you back to me  but what do i do every day mum  what do i do  get up catch the bus go to work come back home eat chips and go to bed is that it   thats what we do well i cant  why cos youre better than us no i didnt mean that  but it was  it was a better life  and i dont mean all the travelling and    seeing aliens and spaceships and things that dont matter  the doctor showed me a better way of living your life  you know he showed you too  that you dont just give up you dont just let things happen  you  make a stand  you say no  you have the guts to do whats right when everyone else just runs away and i just cant  right lynda you are my eyes and ears when the daleks get in follow them on that screen and tell me  yes theyll detect you but the hydra combination door should keep them out should  its the best i can do how long till the fleet arrives theyve accelerated  this is it ladies and gentlemen we are at war  you cant spend the rest of your life thinking about the doctor  but how do i forget him  start living your own life  a proper life the kind hes never had the sort of life that you could have with me  over here   its over here as well  thats been there for years its just a phrase just words  i thought it was a warning  maybe its the opposite  maybe its a message the same words written down now and 200 000 years in the future  its a link between me and the doctor bad wolf here bad wolf there  if its a message whats it saying its saying i can get back the least i can do is help him escape  stand your ground everyone follow my commands and good luck  you were right theyre forcing the airlock on 494  clanking  all the tardis needs to do is make a return trip just  reverse  but we still cant do it the doctor said the tardis is telepathic its alive it can listen  its not listening now is it we need to get inside it  last time i saw you with the slitheen this middle bit opened  and there was this light and the doctor said it was the heart of the tardis if we can open it  i can make contact i can tell it what to do  rose if you go back youre gonna die  thats a risk ive gotta take  cos theres nothing left for me here  nothing no  ok if thats what you think   lets get this thing open  ok activate internal lasers  slice em up  defences have gone offline the daleks have overridden them  you lied to me the bullets dont work  aaargh  faster  come on  its not moving  advance guard have got to 495 jack how are we doing  identify yourself  you are the weakest link goodbye  yes  you are the weakest link  goodbye    proceed to next level

firepower should be at its weakest  im only here cos of you  i joined the programme cos you were on it  am i supposed to say when this is all over we could go for a drink  thatd be nice yeah well tough  theres gotta be something else we can do  mum was right  maybe we should lock the door and walk away im not having that  im not having you just   give up now no way  we just need something

exterminator  ill do it then prove yourself doctor  what are you  coward or killer  coward  any day  mankind will be harvested because of your weakness  and what about me  am i becoming one of your angels  you are the heathen  you will be exterminated  maybe its time  tardis whirrs  alert tardis materialising  you will not escape  what have you done   i looked into the tardis  and the tardis looked into me  you looked into the time vortex  rose noones meant to see that  this is the abomination  exterminate  i am the bad wolf  i create myself  i take the words    i scatter them in time and space  a message to lead myself here  rose youve got to stop this youve got to stop this now  youve got the entire vortex running through your head youll burn  i want you safe  my doctor    protected from the false god  you cannot hurt me i am immortal  you are tiny  i can see the whole of time and space  every single atom of your existence and i divide them  everything must come to dust  all

rose tyler  i was gonna take you to so many places barcelona  not the city barcelona the planet barcelona youd love it fantastic place  theyve got dogs with no noses  imagine how many times youd tell that joke and its still funny  then why cant we go maybe you will and maybe i will but not like this  youre not making sense  i might never make sense again i might have two heads or no head  imagine me with no head and dont say thats an improvement  but its a bit dodgy this process you never know what youll end up with  doctor stay away  tell me whats goin on  i absorbed all the energy of the time vortex and noones meant to do that  every cell in my bodys dying  well cant you do something yeah im doin it now  time lords have this little trick its er  sort of a way of cheating death  except
