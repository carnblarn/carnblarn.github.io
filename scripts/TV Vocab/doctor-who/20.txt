you should leave right now  not until youve answered my questions  how come your televisions are so cheap its my patriotic duty  seems only right that as many folk as possible get to watch the coronation  we may be losing the empire but we can still be proud  be watching imagine that  and 20 million people cant be wrong eh  so why dont you get yourself home and get up early for the big day  no im not leaving till ive seen everything  i need to close  mr magpie    somethings happening out there  ordinary people are being struck down and changed  and the only new thing in the house is a television  your television  whats going on  i knew this would happen  i knew id be found out  all right then just you and me  you gonna come clean then  whats really in it for you for me  perhaps some peace  from what from her  but thats just a woman on the telly thats just a programme what a pretty little girl  oh my god are you talking to me  yes im talking to you little one  unseasonably chilly for the time of year dont you think  what are you  im the wire  and i am hungry  magpie help me  just think of that audience tomorrow my dear all settling down to watch the coronation   things will never be the same again rose yells  im sorry so sorry help me  good night children everywhere  start from the beginning tell me everything you know  well for starters  i know you cant wrap your hand around your elbow and make your fingers meet  dont get clever with me you were there today at florizel street and now breaking into this place  oh youre connected to this make no mistake  well the thing is detective inspector bishop    how do you know my name its written inside your collar  bless your mum but i cant help thinking detective inspector  youre not exactly doing much detective inspecting are you  im doing everything in my power youre grabbing the faceless people and hiding them dont tell me  orders from above  its coronation day the eyes of the world are on london town  so any sort of problem just gets swept out of sight  the nation has an image to maintain  but doesnt it drive you mad doing nothing dont you want to get out there and investigate  course i do but    with all the crowds expected we havent got the manpower  even if we did this is beyond anything weve ever seen  i just dont know any more  i dont even know where to start  we havent the faintest clue whats going on well    that could change  how  start from the beginning tell me everything you know  we started finding them about a month ago  persons left sans visage heads just   blank  but is there any sort of pattern its spreading out from north london  all over the city  men women kids grannies  only real lead is theres been quite a large number in   florizel street  found another one sir good man crabtree here we are doctor  take a good look see what you can deduce  rose    you know her  know her shes    found her in the street apparently down by damascus road  just abandoned thats unusual thats the first one in the open    voice fades then returns  well have torchwood on our backs then    they did what im sorry  they left her where  just in the street  in the street they left her in the street  they took her face and just chucked her out and left her in the street  and as a result that makes things simple  very very simple dyou know why  no   because now detective inspector bishop there is no power on this earth that can stop me  come on  the big day dawns  youve had your fun with your little doctor  but now youre left with me rita so youll behave yourself  and smile  here we go everyone here we go grubs up grubs up  tuck in everyone tuck in take a sandwich  oh here we go here we go its started  look look take your places sit down sit down  rita love just look at that tellybox then  eh innit marvellous the pictures so clear  ere bet i says to rita i says you didnt need to get your hair done special love  the queen wont be able to see you  wheres your old mum

to understand but ive got a position to maintain  people round here respect me it matters what people think  is that why you did it dad  what dyou mean did what you ratted on gran  how else would the police know where to look unless some coward told them  how dare you   you think i fought a war just so a mouthy little scum like you could call me a coward   you dont get it do you you fought against fascism remember  people telling you how to live   who you could be friends with who you could fall in love with  who could live and who had to die dont you get it  you were fighting so that twerps
