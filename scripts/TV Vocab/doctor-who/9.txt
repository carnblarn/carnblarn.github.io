boy and it isnt a boy and it started about a month ago right  the thing im looking for the thing that fell from the sky thats when it landed  and you know what im talking about dont you there was a bomb  a bomb that wasnt a bomb fell the other end of limehouse green station take me there  soldiers guarding it barbed wire  youd never get through try me  sure you want to know whats going on in there i really wanna know  then theres someone you need to talk to first and who might that be  the doctor  its getting late i should be getting back  were discussing business  this isnt business this is champagne  i try never to discuss business with a clear head  bombs explode  are you travelling alone are you authorised to negotiate with me  what would we be negotiating  i have something for the time agency something theyd like to buy  are you empowered to make payment  well i i should talk to my    companion companion i should really be getting back to him  him do you have the time  big ben chimes  ok that was flash  that was on the flash side  so when you say your companion  just how disappointed should i be ok were standing in midair  on a spaceship during a german air raid  do you really think nows a good time to be coming on to me  perhaps not well it was just a suggestion  do you like glenn miller  music moonlight serenade by glen miller and his orchestra  its 1941  height of the london blitz height of the german bombing campaign  and something else has fallen on london   a fullyequipped chula warship  the last one in existence armed to the teeth  and i know where it is  because i parked it  if the agency can name the right price  i can get it for you  but in two hours  a german bomb is going to fall on it and destroy it forever  thats your deadline thats the deal  now shall we discuss payment  you know what i think what  i think you were talking just there  two hours the bomb falls therell be nothing left but dust and a crater  promises promises  are you listening to any of this  you used to be a time agent now youre some kind of freelancer  a little harsh i like to think of myself as a criminal  ill bet you do  so this companion of yours does he handle the business  well i delegate a lot of that yeah  well maybe we should go find him and how you gonna do that  easy  ill do a scan for alien tech beeping  finally  a professional  the bombs under that tarpaulin they put the fence up overnight  see that building the hospital  what about it  thats where the doctor is  you should talk to him for now im more interested in getting in there  talk to the doctor first why  because then maybe you wont wanna get inside  where you going  there was a lot of food in that house ive got mouths to feed should be safe enough now  can i ask you a question  who did you lose what  the way you look after all those kids its cos you lost somebody isnt it  youre doing all this to make up for it  my little brother  jamie  one night i went out looking for food same night that thing fell  told him not to follow me i told him it was dangerous  but he just    he just didnt like being on his own what happened  in the middle of an air raid what dyou think happened  amazing what is  not very far from here  the german war machine is rolling up the map of europe  country after country falling like dominoes nothing can stop it nothing  until one tiny damp little island  says no no  not here  a mouse in front of a lion  youre amazing the lot of you  dunno what you do to hitler you frighten the hell out of me  off you go then do what youve got to do  save the world  door squeaks  youll find them everywhere  in every bed in every ward hundreds of them  yes i saw  why are they still wearing gas masks theyre not who are you  im   are you the doctor  dr constantine and you are  nancy sent me nancy  that means you must have been asking about the bomb yes  what do you know about it nothing why i was asking what do you know  only what its done these people they were all caught up in the blast  none of them were  he coughs  youre very sick  dying i should think i just havent been able to find the time are you a doctor  i have my moments have you examined any of them yet  no dont touch the flesh  which one any one  conclusions massive head trauma mostly to the left side  partial collapse of the chest cavity to the right  scarring on the back of the hand  the gas mask seems to be fused to the flesh but i cant see any burns  examine another one  this isnt possible and examine another  this isnt possible no theyve all got the same injuries  yes exactly the same yes right down to the scar on the back of the hand  how did this happen how did it start when that bomb dropped there was just one victim dead  at first his injuries were truly dreadful  by the following morning every doctor and nurse who had treated him  who had touched him  had those exact same injuries  by the morning after that every patient on the same ward the exact same injuries  within a week the entire hospital  physical injuries  as plague  can you explain that  what would you say was the cause of death  the head trauma no asphyxiation  no the collapse of the chest cavity no all right    what was the cause of death  there wasnt one  theyre not dead  its all right theyre harmless  they just sort of sit there theres no heartbeat  no life signs of any kind  they just    dont die  theyre just left here nobodys doing anything i try and make them comfortable what else is there  just you youre the only one here before this war began i was a father and a grandfather  now im neither but im still a doctor  yeah know the feeling i suspect the plan is to blow up the hospital  and blame it on a german bomb  probably too late i know  there are isolated cases   he coughs   isolated cases breaking out   all over  london  stay back stay back  listen to me  top floor room 802  thats where they took the first victim the one from the crash site  and you must find nancy again nancy  it was her brother she knows more than shes saying  she wont tell me but she m    mummeee    are you   my  mummy  her brother  hello hello  hello  good evening hope were
