days when the doctor  oh that famous doctor was waging  a time war battling sea devils and axons  he sealed the rift at the medusa cascade singlehanded  and look at him now  stealing screwdrivers  how did he ever come to this  oh yeah me  i just  need you to listen  no its my turn revenge  best served hot and this time  its a message for miss jones  professor docherty busy  they sent word im tom

deseen but weve been told theres going to be a transmission  from the man himself there  my people  salutations on this the eve of war  lovely woman  but i know theres all sorts of whispers stories of a child walking the earth  giving you hope  but i ask you  how much hope has this man got  say hello gandalf  excepthes not that old  but hes an alien with a much greater  lifespan than you stunted little apes  what if it showed  what if i suspend your capacity to regenerate  all 900 years of your life doctor what if we could see them  older and older and older  down you go doctor  down down down the years  doctor  received and understood miss jones  im sorry  the doctors still alive  the archangel network seems to be the masters greatest weakness  still transmitting  thats why theres no resistance  its broadcasting a telepathic signal that keeps people scared  we could take them out  we could 15 groundtoair missiles got any any military action the toclafane descend  theyre not toclafane the master made that up  then what are they thats why i came to you know your enemy  ive got this  noones been able to see a sphere close up they cant even be damaged  the lightning strike in south africa brought one down by chance ive got the readings on this  oh whoever thought wed miss bill gates  is that why you travelled the world to find a disc no just got lucky  i heard you walked the earth to find a way to build a weapon  there a current of 585 kilo amperes  transferred charge of  can you recreate that i think so easily yes  right then dr milligan  were gonna get us a sphere  hes comingyou ready you do your job ill do mine  now  thats only half the job  lets find out whats inside  im gonna kill him if i have to wait a hundred years  im going to kill the master  one day hell let his guard down one day  and ill be there  no thats my job  i swear to you id shoot that man stone dead  ill get him  even if it kills me dont say that i mean it  that man made us stand on deck and watch the islands of japan burning  millions of people  i swear to you hes dead  tomorrow they launch  were opening up a rift in the braccatolian space  wont see us coming kind of scary then stop  once the empire is established and theres a new gallifrey in the heavens  maybe then it stops  the drumming the neverending drumbeat  ever since i was a child i looked into the vortex  thats when it chose me the drumming the call to war  cant you hear it  listen its there now right now  tell me you can hear it doctor  tell me its only you  good  tomorrow the war  tomorrow we rise never to fall  you see  im doing it for them you should be grateful  after all you love them  so very very much  theres some sort of magnetic clamp hold on ill just trip the  oh my god  they gasp its alive  martha martha jones  it knows you sweet kind martha jones you helped us to fly  what dyou mean you led us to salvation  who are you the skies are made of diamonds  no you cant be him the skies are made of diamonds  we share each others memories you sent him to utopia oh my god  whats it talking about  what are they martha  martha tell us what are they  theyre us theyre humans  the human race from the future  i took lucy to utopia  isnt that right sweetheart  trillions of years into the future  to the end of the universe  tell him what you saw dying  everything dying  the whole of creation falling apart  and i thoughttheres no point  no point to anything not ever and its all your fault  martha id sort of worked it out with the paradox machine  the doctor said the day before the master came to power  when he stole the tardis all i could do was fuse the coordinates  i locked them permanently  he could only travel between the year one hundred trillion and the last place the tardis landed  which is right here right now  the master had the tardis this time machine but the only place he could go was the end of the universe  so he found utopia  you should have seen it doctor furnaces burning  the last of humanity screaming at the dark  the utopia project was the last hope  trying to find a way to escape the end of everything  there was no solution no diamonds  just the dark and the cold  human invention that had sustained them across the aeons turned inward they cannibalised themselves  we made ourselves so pretty  regressing into children but it didnt work the universe was collapsing around them  but then the master came with his wonderful time machine  to bring us back home  but thats a paradox  if youre the future and youve come back to murder your ancestors  you should cancel yourselves out you shouldnt exist  thats the paradox machine  my masterpiece doctor a living tardis strong enough to hold the paradox in place  allowing the past and the future to collide in infinite majesty  but youre changing history  not just earth the entire universe  im a time lord  i have that right  but even then  why come all this way just to destroy  weve come backwards in time all to build a brandnew empire  lasting one hundred trillion years  with me as their master  time lord and humans combined havent you always dreamt of that doctor  what about us were the same species why dyou kill us  because its fun  sphere laughs  human race   greatest monsters of them all  night then  its time we had the truth miss jones  legend says you travelled the world to find a way of killing the master tell us is it true  just before i escaped the doctor told me  the doctor and the master theyve been coming to earth for years and theyve been watched  theres unit and torchwood all studying time lords in secret  they made this the ultimate defence  i can shoot the master with this  you can put that down now  its not easy to kill a time lord they can regenerate  literally bring themselves back to life ah the masters immortal wonderful except for this  four chemicals in the gun inject him  kills a time lord permanently  four chemicals youve only got three  still need the last one the components were kept safe scattered across the world  and i found them san diego beijing budapestand london  then where is it  an old unit base north london ive found the access codes get me there  we cant get across london at night its full of wild dogs  tomorrow we can go with the medical convoy you can stay here  we can get halfway stay at the slave quarters in bexley professor thank you and you  good luck thanks  martha  could you do it could you actually kill him  got no choice youre many things but you dont look like a killer  let me in its

jones yeah thats me  can you kill him they said you can kill the master can you  tell us you can do it please  they speak over each other  come on leave her alone shes exhausted  no its all right  they want me to talk and i will  access priority one  this is professor alison docherty state your intent first of all i need to know about my son  state your intent is my son still alive  state your intent  i have some information for the master  concerning martha jones  guess what  i travelled from the ruins of new york to the fusion mills of china  right across the radiation pits of europe  everywhere i saw people like you living as slaves  if martha jones became a legend thats wrong because im not important  theres someone else  the man who sent me the man who told me to walk the earth  and his nameis the doctor  he never stops he never stays he never asks to be thanked  but ive seen him i know him  i love him  and i know what he can do  its him oh my god its him the master hes here  but he never comes to earth he never walks on the ground hide her  he walks among us our lord and master martha  martha johones  i can seeeeee you  out you come little girl come and meet your master  anybody nobody no nothing  positions  ill give the order  unless you surrender  ask yourself  what would the doctor do  oh yes  oh very well done  good girl he trained you well  bag give me the bag  no stay there just throw it  and now good companion  your work is done  no  but youwhen you die  the doctor should be witness hmmm  almost dawn martha  and planet earth  marches to war  citizens of earth  rejoice and observe  your teleport device in case you thought id forgotten  and now  kneel  down below the fleet is ready to launch  set to burn across the universe  are we ready  the fleet awaits your signal rejoice  three minutes to align the black hole convertors counting down  ticking  i never could resist a ticking clock my children are you ready  spheres we will fly and blaze and slice we will fly and blaze and slice  at zero to mark this day the child martha jones will die  my first blood  any last words  no  such a disappointment this one days of old doctor  you had companions who could absorb the time vortex this ones useless  bow your head  and so it falls to me as master of all to establish from this day a new order of time lords  from this day forward  she laughs  whatwhats so funny  a gun what about it a gun in four parts  yes and i destroyed it  a gun in four parts scattered across the world i mean  did you really believe that what dyou mean  as if i would ask her to kill  oh well it does not matter i have her exactly where i want her  but i knew what professor doherty would do  the resistance knew about her son  thats why i came to you know your enemy  i told her about the gun so shed get me here at the right time youre still gonna die  dont you want to know what i was doing  tell me i told a story thats all  no weapons just words  i did what the doctor said i went across the continents  and everywhere i went i found the people and i told them my story  he saved your lives so many times and you never knew he was there  i know him i told them about the doctor i love him  i told them to pass it on so everyone would know about the doctor  faith and hope is that all  no i gave them an instruction as the doctor said  use the countdown i told them if everyone thinks of one word at one time  nothing will happen  is that your weapon  prayer right across the world  one word just one thought at one moment  but with 15 satellites  what the archangel network  a telepathic field binding the human race together  with all of them every single person on earth thinking the same thing at the same time  and that word is doctor  stop it no no no
