someone there for him  i want to be that someone  so he doesnt die alone  november the 7th 1987  music never can say goodbye by the communards  thats so weird  the day my father died   i thought it would be all sort of grim and stormy its just an ordinary day  the past is another country   you sure about this yeah  this is it jordan road  he was late    hed been to get a wedding present the vase  mum always said that stupid vase  he got out of his car  and crossed the road   oh god this is it  go to him quick  its too late now  by the time the ambulance got there he was dead  he cant die on
