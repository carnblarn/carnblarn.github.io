mr van statten sort of lets me do my own thing  so long as i deliver the goods  what do you think that is  a lump of metal yeah  yeah but i think   well im almost certain its from the hull of a spacecraft  the thing is its all true everything the united nations tries to keep quiet  spacecraft aliens visitors to earth  they really exist  thats amazing i know it sounds incredible  but i honestly believe the whole universe is just teeming with life  im gobsmacked yeah  and you do what sit here and catalogue it best job in the world  imagine if you could get out there  travel amongst the stars and see it for real  yeah id give anything i dont think its ever gonna happen  not in our lifetimes oh you never know  what about all those people who say theyve been inside of spaceships and things and talked to aliens  i think theyre nutters yeah me too  so how dyou end up here  van statten has agents all over looking for geniuses to recruit oh right youre a genius  sorry but  yeah i cant help it  i was born clever  when i was eight i logged onto the us defence system  nearly caused world war three what and thats funny is it  you shouldve been there just to see them running about fantastic  you sound like the doctor  are you and him    no were just friends good  whys that good  just is  so wouldnt you rather be downstairs  youve got these bits of metal and stuff  but mr van stattens got a living creature down there  yeah well i did ask but he keeps it to himself  although   if youre a genius  it doesnt take long to patch through on the comms system  lets have a look then  it doesnt do much the alien  its weird its kind of  useless  its just like this great big pepperpot  man drills  dalek screams its being tortured wheres the doctor i dont know  take me down there now  the metals just battle armour the real dalek creature is inside  what does it look like its a mutation they were genetically engineered  every single emotion was removed except hate  genetically engineered by whom by a genius van statten  by a man who was king of his own little world youd like him  its been on earth for over 50 years sold at private auction  moving between collections why would it be a threat now  because im here how did it get to earth  the records say it came from the sky like a meteorite it fell to earth on the ascension islands  burnt in its crater for three days before anybody could get near it  and all that time it was screaming must have gone insane  it must have fallen through time  the only survivor you talked about a war  the time war the final battle between my people and the daleks  but  you survived too not by choice  this means the dalek isnt the only alien on earth doctor  theres you the only one of your kind in existence  now  smile  two hearts a binary vascular system  oh i am so gonna patent this so thats your secret  you dont just collect stuff you scavenge it  this technology has been falling to earth for centuries  all it took was the right mind to use it properly  oh the advances ive made from alien junk   you have no idea doctor broadband roswell  just last year my scientists cultivated bacteria  from the russian crater and do you know what we found  the cure for the common cold  kept it within the laboratory of course no need to get people excited  why sell one cure when i can sell a thousand palliatives  dyou know what a dalek is van statten  a dalek is honest  it does what it was born to do for the survival of its species  that creature in your dungeon is better than you in that case i will be true to myself  and continue  listen to me that thing downstairs is gonna kill every last one of us  nothing can escape the cage  but its woken up it knows im here its gonna get out  van statten i swear noone on this base is safe  noone on this planet  aaah  hold it right there level three access special clearance from mr van statten  dont get too close  hello  are you in pain  my names rose tyler my friend can

before i die  i met a human  who was not afraid  isnt there anything i can do  my race is dead  i shall die alone  rose no  genetic material extrapolated  initiate cellular reconstruction  what the hell have you done  what ya gonna do sucker me to death  muffled scream  its killing him do something condition red  repeat this is not a drill  release me if you want to live  youve got to keep it in that cell doctor its all my fault  ive sealed the compartment the locks got a billion combinations  a dalek is a genius it can calculate a thousand billion combinations in one second flat  open fire  dont shoot it  i want it unharmed  rose get out of there gunshots  de maggio get the civilians out alive that is your job got that  you with me  electrical buzz  abandoning the cage sir  were losing power its draining the base  oh my god its draining the entire power supplies of the whole of utah  its downloading downloading what  sir the entire west coast has gone down  its not just energy that dalek just absorbed the entire internet  it knows everything  the daleks survive in me  the cameras in the vault are down weve only got emergency power  kill it now all guards to converge on the metaltron cage immediately  civilians let em through  cover the north wall reds maintain suppressing fire along the perimeter blues    agh gunshots  gnaaaargh  aaah  aaaaah  tell them to stop shooting at it but its killing them  theyre dispensable  that dalek is unique  i dont want a scratch on its bodywork do you hear me  do you hear me  gunshots die out  thats us right below the surface  thats the cage and thats the dalek  have you got any alien weapons lots of them but the daleks between us and them  weve got to keep it alive we could just seal the entire vault leaving everyone trapped with it  rose is down there i wont let that happen got that  it has to go through this area whats that weapons testing  give guns to technicians lawyers  anyone everyone only then have you got a chance of killing it  stairs thats more like it hasnt got legs  its stuck  its coming get up  great big alien death machine  defeated by a flight of stairs  now listen to me i demand that you return to your cage  if you want to negotiate mr van statten will be willing to talk  i accept that we imprisoned you and maybe that was wrong  but people have died and that stops  right now  the killing stops have you got that  i demand that you surrender is that clear  elevate  oh my god  adam get her out of here  come with us you cant stop it  someones got to try now get out  dont look back just run  woman screams loudly  i thought you were the great expert doctor  if youre so impressive why not just reason with this dalek  it must be willing to negotiate it must need something  everything does whats the nearest town salt lake city population one million all dead  if the dalek gets out itll murder every creature thats all it needs  but why  it honestly believes they should die human beings are different and different is wrong  its the ultimate in racial cleansing and you van statten let it loose  the daleks got a force field the bullets melt before they hit  but its not indestructible if you concentrate your fire you might get through  aim for the dome  the head the eyepiece thats the weak spot  thank you doctor but i think i know how to fight one single tin robot  positions  hold your fire  you two get the hell out of there  it was looking at me yeah it wants to slaughter us  no but it was looking right at me  so its just a sort of metal eye thing its looking all around  i dont know its like theres something inside  looking at me like    like it knows me  on my mark  open fire volley of shots  weve got vision  it wants us to see  screams  fall back fall back  perhaps its time for a new strategy maybe we should consider abandoning this place  except theres no power to the helipad sir we cant get out  you said we could seal the vault it was designed to be a bunker in the event of nuclear war  steel bulkheads   not enough power weve got emergency power  we can reroute that wed need a computer genius to bypass the security  good  thing youve got me then you want to help i dont want to die doctor simple as that  and nobody knows this software better than me sir     i shall speak only to the doctor  youre gonna get rusty  i fed off the dna of rose tyler  extrapolating the biomass of a timetraveller  regenerated me whats your next trick  i have been searching for the daleks  yeah i saw  downloading the internet what did you find  i scanned your satellites and radio telescopes  and nothing  where shall i get my orders now  youre just a soldier without commands  then i shall follow the primary order  the dalek instinct to destroy to conquer  what for whats the point   dont you see its all gone everything you were everything you stood for  then what should i do  all right then  if you want orders follow this one  kill yourself  the daleks must survive  the daleks have failed  why dont you finish the job and make the daleks extinct  rid the universe of your filth why dont you just die   you would make a good dalek  seal the vaults  i can leech power off the ground defences feed it to the bulkheads  its years since i had to work this fast are you enjoying this doctor shes still down there  mobile phone rings  this isnt the best time  where are you level 49  youve got to keep moving the vault is being sealed off up at level 46  cant you stop them closing im closing them  i cant wait and i cant help you now for gods sake run

mankind goes into space to explore to be part of something greater    exactly i wanted to touch the stars  you just want to drag the stars down and stick them underground underneath tons of sand and dirt  and label them  youre about as far from the stars as you can get  and you took her down with you  she was 19 years old  go on then kill me  why are you doing this   i am armed i will kill  it is my purpose  theyre all dead because of you  they are dead because of us  and now what  what are you waiting for  i feel your fear  what dyou expect daleks do not fear must not fear  you gave me life
