exactly like those stories oh dont start that again  i think you need to take a session off  i would if youd take it with me and dont start that again either  though the rumours go back decades saying that somethings been hidden up here  underneath the transmissions  but the controller would know  she watches everything  maybe she just cant see it  youve got to allow for human error well thats your problem then  i dont think shes been human for years   are you insane  you just step right into the disintegrator is it that important getting your face on the telly  is it worth dying for  we havent got a choice  but i thought you had to apply dont be so stupid thats how they played it centuries back  you get chosen whether you like it or not  everyone on earth is a potential contestant the transmat beam picks you out at random  its nonstop there are 60 big brother houses running at once  how many 60 theyve had to cut back its not what it was  its a charnel house  what about the winners what do they get they get to live is that it  well isnt that enough  rose is out there she got caught in the transmat shes a contestant  time i got out  that other contestant linda with an i she was forcibly evicted for what  damage to property what like this  no im just not getting this its just too  safe too decent and youd never keep it clean  stage two ready and waiting  bring it on girls  now its time for the faceoff  does that mean i get to compete with someone else  no like i said face  off  i think youd look good with a dogs head  or maybe no head at all that would be so outrageous

house rules big brother has no choice but to evict you  you have ten seconds to make your farewells and then were gonna get you  come on then open up youre mad its like you want to die  i reckon hes a

sort of readings all kinds of energy  the place is humming its weird this goes way beyond normal transmissions  what would they need all that power for i dont know  i think were the first ever contestants to get outside  i had two friends with me they mustve got caught in the same transmat where would they be  they could have been allocated anywhere theres 100 different games  like what well theres ten floors of big brother  theres a different house behind each door  and beyond that theres all sorts of shows its nonstop  theres em  call my bluff with real guns  countdown where youve got 30 seconds to stop the bomb going off  ground force which is a nasty one you get turned into compost  erm  wipeout  speaks for itself oh and stars in their eyes literally  stars in their eyes  if you dont sing you get blinded  and you watch this stuff  everyone does how come you dont  i never paid for my licence  oh my god you get executed for that  let em try  you keep saying things that dont make sense  who are you though doctor really  it doesnt matter  well it does to me ive just put my life in your hands  im a traveller wandering past  believe it or not all im after is a quiet life  so

recognise your existence whats her name  i dont know she was installed when she was five years old thats the only life shes ever known  doors sealed were safe for about ten minutes keep an eye on em  that stuff about something going on with the game station i think youre right  ive kept a log unauthorised transmats encrypted signals  its been going on for years show me  youre not allowed in there archive six is out of bounds  do i look like an outofbounds sort of guy  what the hell     solar flare activity in delta    if youre not holding us hostage let us out the staff are terrified  thats the same staff who execute hundreds of contestants were just doing our jobs  with that sentence you just lost the right to even talk to me now back off  thats just the solar flares  they interfere with the broadcast signal so this place automatically powers down  planet earth gets a few repeats its all quite normal doctor    doctor whatever it is you can wait i think she wants you  doctor   doctor    wheres the doctor im here  i cant see blind    so blind all my life blind  all i can see is numbers but i saw you what do you want  solar flares hiding me they cant hear me  my masters listen but they cant hear me now the sun  the sun is so bright who are your masters  they wired my head the name is forbidden  they control my thoughts  my masters i had to be careful they monitor transmission but they dont watch the programmes  i could hide you inside the games my friend died inside your games  it doesnt matter dont you dare tell me that  theyve been hiding my masters hiding in the dark space watching and shaping the earth  so  so  so many years  always been there guiding humanity hundreds and hundreds of years  who are they they wait and plan and grow in numbers  theyre strong now so strong my masters who are they  but speak of you  my masters they fear the doctor tell me who are they  whens the next solar flare two years time  fat lot of good that is found the tardis  were not leaving now no but the tardis worked it out  youll wanna watch this lynda could you stand over there for me please  i just wanna go home  itll only take a second could you stand in that spot quick as you can  everybody watching  ok three two one  but you killed her oh do you think  what the hell was that its a transmat beam not a disintegrator a secondary transmat system  people dont get killed in the games they get transported across space  doctor rose is still alive  no it cant be  i saw you die  shes out there somewhere doctor  coordinates 561  dont the solar flares gone theyll hear you  no my masters no i defy you  sigma 7   aaaah they took her  oh my masters    you can kill me    for i have brought your destruction  look use that it might contain the final numbers  i kept a log of all the unscheduled transmissions nice  thanks  captain jack harkness by the way  im davitch pavale nice to meet you davitch pavale  theres a time and a place  are you saying that this whole setups been a disguise all along  going way back installing the jagrafess 100 years ago  someones been playing a long game controlling the human race from behind the scenes for generations  click on this  the transmat delivers to that point  right on the edge of the solar system but theres nothing there  it looks like nothing because thats what this satellite does  underneath the transmission theres another signal doing what  hiding whatevers out there  hiding it from sonar radar scanner  theres somethings sitting right on top of planet earth but its completely invisible  if i cancel the signal    thats impossible  i know those ships they were destroyed  obviously they survived who did who are they   more than 2 000 on board each one  thats just about half a million of them  half a million what  daleks  alert alert we are detected  it is the doctor he has located us  open communications channel  the female will stand stand  i will talk to the doctor  oh will you thats nice hello  the dalek stratagem nears completion  the fleet is almost ready you will not intervene  oh really whys that then  we have your associate  you will obey or she will be exterminated  no  explain yourself  i said no  what is the meaning of this negative  it means no but she will be destroyed  no  cos this is what im gonna do  im gonna rescue her im gonna save rose tyler from the middle of the dalek fleet  and then im gonna save the earth and then just to finish off  im gonna wipe every last stinking dalek out of the sky  but you have no weapons no defences no plan  yeah    and doesnt that scare you to death  rose yes doctor  im coming to get you  the doctor is initiating hostile action the statagem must advance  begin the invasion of earth  the doctor will be exterminated  exterminate exterminate  exterminate  exterminate exterminate  launch missiles exterminate  weve got incoming this is it ladies and gentlemen we are at war  theres an army about to invade this station  defences have gone offline  im dead or about to die any second with no chance of escape  im dead or about to die any second with no chance of escape  they interfere with the broadcast signal so this place automatically powers down  how did you survive the time war  they survived through me
