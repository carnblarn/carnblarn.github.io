                  martha have you met my friend  i have always wanted to go to new york  november 1st 1930   you only come to hooverville when theres nowhere else to go  men going missing  laszlo  dalek the empire state building must be completed in time  are you trying to kill us dont argue with me  this human is our best option  no  the final experiment will begin  the children of skaro must walk again  what is it  i am  a human dalek  these humans  will become like me  prepare them for hybridisation  leave him alone dont you dare  music plays what is that sound  ah well now that would be me hello surprise  boo et cetera doctor  the enemy of the daleks  exterminate wait  well then a new form of dalek  fascinating  and very clever  the cult of skaro escaped your slaughter  how did you end up in 1930  emergency temporal shift oh oh  that mustve roasted up your power cells yeah  time was four daleks couldve conquered the world  but instead youre skulking away hidden in the dark experimenting  all of which results in you  i am dalek in human form  but what does it feel like  you can talk to me dalek sec  it is dalek sec isnt it thats your name  youve got a name a mind of your own  tell me what youre thinking right now  i  feel  humanity good thats good  i feel  everything we wanted from mankind  which is  ambition  hatred aggression  and war  such a genius for war  no thats not what humanity means i think it does  at heart this species  is so very dalek  right so what have you achieved then with this final experiment eh  nothing cos i can show you what youre missing with this thing  a simple little radio  what is the purpose of that device  well exactly it plays music whats the point of that  oh with music you can dance to it  sing with it  fall in love to it  unless youre a dalek of course then its all just noise  highpitched wail  run protect the hybrid  protect protect protect  report status  pain  pain of the flesh  like no dalek has felt for thousands of years  the doctor has escaped  then find him find him  find the doctor  the prisoners must be recaptured  cmon move move move move move  and you tallulah run  whats happened to laszlo  cmon everyone up come on come on  they have ascended  return to base pig siaves grunt  request information what is your opinion of dalek sec  we were created to follow him  but you have doubts  affirmative  these daleks they sound like the stuff of nightmares and they want to breed  theyre splicing themselves on to human bodies  theyve a farm of breeding stock right here youve got to get out  hoovervilles the lowest place to go theres nowhere else  im sorry solomon but youve got to scatter  get on to the railroads travel across state just get out of new york  you aint seen em boss  daleks are bad enough at any time but right now theyre vulnerable  that makes them more dangerous than ever  grunts  whistie biows theyre coming theyre coming  a sentry must have seen something  theyre here ive seen them  monsters  its started were under attack  everyone to arms  im ready boss but all of you find a weapon  use anything come back weve got to stick together  its not safe out there come back  no no  we need to get out of the park we cant theyre on all sides  theyre driving everyone here were trapped stand together  gather round everybody come to me  you there jethro harry seamus stay together  they cant take all of us gunshots  theyre just the foot soldiers  oh my god  what in this world its the devil a devil in the sky  god save us all its damnation oh yeah well see about that  thats not gonna work  establish visual contact  commence the attack  theres more than one of them  the humans will surrender  leave them alone theyve done nothing to you  we have located the doctor  no solomon stay back  im told that im addressing the daleks is that right  observe humanity  for all their faults they have such courage  from what i hear youre outcasts too  solomon dont doctor this is my township  you will respect my authority   just let me try  daleks aint we the same  underneath aint we all kin   cos you see  ive just discovered this past day  that gods universe is a thousand times the size i thought it was  and that scares me  oh yeah  terrifies me right down to the bone  but surely its got to give me hope   hope that maybe together we can make a better tomorrow  so i beg you now  if you have any compassion in your hearts  then youll meet with us and stop this fight  well  what do you say  exterminate  oh no  he gasps  no solomon  they killed him they just shot him on the spot  daleks  all right so its my turn then kill me  kill me if itll stop you attacking these people  i will be the destroyer of our greatest enemy  then do it do it just do it  do it  extermina  stop i command you stop  i do not understand  it is the doctor  but i want him alive  the urge to kill is too strong  i have decided  the doctor must live  and you will obey me  i obey  whats going on  bring him to me  you will follow  no  you cant go  ive got to go the daleks just changed their minds daleks never change their minds  but what about us  one condition  if i come with you you spare the lives of everyone here dyou hear me  obey the doctor  humans will be spared doctor follow  then im coming with you martha stay here  do what you do best people are hurt you can help them let me go  oh and  can i just say  thank you very much  you saved the doctor  why  hes a genius  and we can use him  the future of the daleks might well depend upon the doctor  here you go i got some more on the boil  thanks  youll be ok its just a cut try and keep it clean thanks  so what about us what do we do now  the doctor gave me this  he mustve had a reason whats that for  it gets you into places buildings and things  but where he must want me to go somewhere but what am i supposed to do  those people were defenceless you only wanted me but that wasnt enough for you  you had to start killing cos thats all a daleks good for  the deaths were wrong  im sorry  that man  their leader solomon he showed courage  and thats good thats excellent  is it me or are you just becoming a little bit more human  you are the last of your kind  and now i am the first of mine  but what do you want me for  we tried everything to survive  when we found ourselves stranded in this ignorant age  first we tried growing new dalek embryos but their flesh was too weak  yeah i found one of your experiments  just left to die out there in the dark  it forced us to conclude   what is the greatest resource of this planet its people  we stole them  we stole human beings for our purpose  look inside  this is the true extent of the final experiment  is he dead  near death  with his mind wiped  ready to be filled with new ideas  dalek ideas  the human dalek race  all of these people  how many  we have caverns beyond this storing more than a thousand  is there any way to restore them to make them human again  everything that they were has been lost  so theyre like shells youve got empty human beings ready to be converted  thats gonna take a lot of power  this planet hasnt even split the atom yet how are you gonna do it open the conductor plan  wait a minute down in the sewers  the daleks mentioned this energy conductor what does that mean  i dunno maybe like a lightning conductor or  dalekanium oh  they said the dalekanium was in place  in place where frank might know  frank hmm that mr diagoras he was some sort of fixer yeah  get you jobs all over town he could find a profit anywhere  but where though what sort of things  you name it  we were all so desperate for work youd just hope diagoras would pick you for something good  building work  that pays the best  but what sort of building work  mainly building that  yeah the empire state building were underneath it i worked that out already  but youve hijacked the whole building  we needed an energy conductor what for  i am the genetic template  my altered dna was to be administered to each human body  a strong enough blast of gamma radiation  can splice the dalek and human genetic codes  and waken each body from its sleep  gamma radiation  oh the sun youre using the sun  soon the greatest solar flare for a thousand years will hit the earth  gamma radiation will be drawn to the energy conductor and when it strikes  the army wakes  i still dont know what you need me for your genius  consider the pure dalek  intelligent but emotionless  removing the emotions makes you stronger thats what your creator thought all those years ago  he was wrong  he was what it makes us lesser than our enemies  we must return to the flesh and also the heart  you wouldnt be the supreme beings any more  and that is good  that is incorrect  daleks are supreme no not any more  but that is our purpose  then our purpose is wrong  where has our quest for supremacy led us  to this  hiding in the sewers on a primitive world  just four of us left  if we do not change now then we deserve extinction  so you want to change everything that makes a dalek a dalek  lf you can help me  i always wanted to go to the empire state   never imagined it quite like this though where are we headed anyway  the top theyre still building how come those guys just let us through  how does that thing work psychic paper  shows them whatever i want them to think  according to this were two engineers and an architect  your knowledge of genetic engineering is even greater than ours  the new race must be ready by the time the solar flare erupts  but youre the template i thought they were getting a dose of you i want to change the gene sequence  to make them even more human humans are the great survivors  we need that ability hold on a minute though  this lot wont let you do it i am their leader  oh and thats enough for you is it  daleks must follow orders  dalek sec commands we obey  if you dont help me nothing will change  theres no room on earth for another race of people  you have your tardis  take us across the stars find us a new home  and allow the new daleks to start again  whens that solar flare   right then better get to work  look at this place top of the world  ok now this looks good  hey look at the date these designs were issued today  they must have changed something last minute the daleks  yeah could be the ones underneath theyre from before  whatever they changed must be on this top sheet but not here check one against the other  the height of this place this is amazing  careful were a hundred floors up dont wander off i just wanna see  new york city  if aliens had to come to earth  oh no wonder they came here  theres no point in chromosomal grafting its too erratic  split the genome and force the new dalekhuman sequence right into the cortex  we need more chromatin solution  the pig slaves have it  these pig slaves  what happens to them in the grand plan nothing  theyre just simple beasts their life span is limited  none survive beyond a few weeks  power up the line feeds  laszlo i cant undo what theyve done to you  but they wont do it to anyone else do you trust him  i know that one man can change the course of history  the right idea in the right place at the right time  thats all it takes  ive got to believe its possible  ill go and keep an eye out make sure were safe here dont want nobody butting in  theres hell of a storm moving in i wish the doctor was here  hed know what were looking for  so tell me where did you and him first hook up  it was in a hospital sort of  course  him being a doctor  actually im the doctor  well kind of youre a physician  really i was training still am if i ever get back home  you could be doctors together  what a partnership  its such a shame  if only he wasnt so different dyou know what i mean  oh you have no idea how different he really is  yeah hes a man sweetheart  thats different enough  he had this  companion a while back this friend  and ever since then hes been on his own  but sometimes i say something or do something and he looks at me  and i just sort of think  that hes not seeing me  hes just remembering  oh listen sweetheart you want to get all sad  you want to have a contest with me and laszlo no  listen if the doctors with laszlo now theres every chance that he could get him out  and then what  dont talk crazy  theres no future for me and him  those dalek things took that away  the one good thing i had in my life and they destroyed it  the line feeds are ready  then its all systems go the solar flare is imminent  the radiation will reach earth in a matter of minutes and well be ready for it  that compound will allow the gene bonds to reconfigure in a new pattern power up  start the line feeds  there goes the gene solution the life blood  gotcha look  there on the mast those little lines theyre new  theyve added something see  added what  both dalekanium  alarm blares whats that  whats happening is there a malfunction  answer me no no no the gene feed  they cant disobey orders  the doctor will step away from the controls  stop you will not fire  he is an enemy of the daleks  and so are you  i am your commander i am dalek sec  you have lost your authority  you are no longer a dalek  whats going into the gene feed the new bodies will be 100 dalek  no you cant do this  pig slaves restrain dalek sec  and the doctor  release me i created you i am your master  alarm blares solar flare approaching  prepare to intercept  theres the lift after you  the doctor is escaping stop him stop him  weve only got minutes we need to get to the top of the building  laszlo pants laszlo whats wrong  out of breath its nothing  we escaped them doctor thats all that matters  you have betrayed me  you told us to imagine  and we imagined your irrelevance  i was your leader i am dalek sec obey me  lift rings  doctor first floor perfumery i never thought id see you again  no stopping me  weve worked it out we know what theyve done  theres dalekanium on the mast and its good to see you too by the way oh come here  no no no no no no no see never waste time with a hug  deadlock seal i cant stop it wheres it going to the daleks  they wont leave us alone whats the time 1115 six minutes  i must remove the dalekanium before the gamma radiation hits gammon radiation whats that  oh thats high thats very blimey thats high  and weve got to go even higher thats the mast up there look  we have to get the three pieces of dalekanium off the base  thats not we thats just me im not gonna just watch you  no youre gonna have your hands full anyway im sorry martha but youve got to fight  confirm time until solar intercept  gamma strike four minutes and counting  pig slaves will take the lift  find the doctor kill him  the lifts coming up i shouldve brought that gun  tallulah stay back you too martha pig slaves are trained to kill  im not going anywhere theyre savages  theyre trained to slit your throat with their bare teeth  laszlo what is it nah its nothing im fine just leave me  oh honey youre burning up whats wrong with you tell me  one man down we aint even started yet  its not looking good frank no were gonna get slaughtered  wait a minute lightning  oh youll be all right sweetheart dont you worry  what the hell are you two clowns doing  this place is gonna get hit a great big bolt of lightning  connect this to the lift and they get zapped with electricity  oh my god that could work then give us a hand  gamma strike imminent in 40 rels   no  is that gonna work its got to i got it all piped up to the scaffolding outside  come here sit in the middle dont touch anything metal ok  aaaaagh i cant   zero gamma strike   aaaagh  the army awakes  you did it martha they used to be like laszlo  they were people  and i killed em  no  the daleks killed them long ago  what about the doctor  you will identify  i am a dalek  excellent begin the invasion of manhattan  the population will be converted into daleks  and from this island we will conquer the world  assume battle positions  take arms  doctor  doctor  look what we found halfway down  youre getting careless  oh my head  hi ya  hi you survived then  so did you just about  i cant help noticing  theres dalekanium still attached  war demands strategy  i am designated controller  that was to be my position you are unfit  connect me to the military computer  i will coordinate all units  the daleks will have gone straight to a war footing using the sewers  spreading soldiers out underneath manhattan how do we stop them theres only one chance  i got in the way that gamma strike went zapping through me first  but what does that mean we need to draw fire  i need to face them where can i draw them out  think think think  i need a space somewhere safe somewhere out of the way tallulah  thats me  three ls and an h the theatres above them can you get us inside dont see why not  is there another lift we came up in the service elevator thatll do allonsy  report status  maximum efficiency  i am now ready for fullscale war  control over dalekhumans  connection confirmed all soldiers will take heed  weapons will be primed  this should do it here we go  there aint nothing more creepy than a theatre in the dark  listen doctor i know youve got a thing for show tunes but theres a time and a place  laszlo whats wrong  nothing  its just so hot but its freezing in here  doctor whats happening to him not now tallulah sorry  what are you doing if the daleks are at war theyll want their numberone enemy  im just telling them where i am  sonic device detected the doctor survived  find him and exterminate  im telling you to go frank can take you  im telling you im not going martha thats an order  who are you then a dalek doors crash open  doctor oh my god  well i guess thats them then huh humans with dalek dna  all right just stay calm dont antagonise them  but where are the dalek masters  doctor located  advance advance  the doctor will stand before the daleks  you will die doctor at the beginning of a new age  planet earth will become new skaro  oh and what a world  with anything just the slightest bit different ground into the dirt  thats dalek sec dont you remember  the cleverest dalek ever look what youve done to him  is that your new empire  mmm  is that the foundation for a whole new civilisation  my daleks  just understand this  if you choose death and destruction  then death and destruction will choose you  incorrect we always survive  now we will destroy our greatest enemy  the doctor  but he can help you the doctor must die no  i beg you dont  exterminate  your own leader the only creature who might have  led you out of the darkness and you destroyed him  dyou see what they did huh  dyou see what a dalek really is  warning dalekhumans show increased levels of serotonin  if im gonna die lets give the new boys a shot what dyou think eh  the dalek humans their first blood  go on baptise them  dalekhumans take aim  what are you waiting for give the command  exterminate  exterminate  obey dalekhumans will obey  theyre not firing  what have you done  you will obey  exterminate  why daleks do not question orders  but why you will stop this  but why you must not question  but you are not our master and we we are not daleks  no youre not and you never will be  sorry i got in the way of the lightening strike  time lord dna got all mixed up just that little bit of freedom  if they will not obey then they must die  get down  exterminate  exterminate  destroy the hybrids destroy  exterminate extermin  its all right its all right you did it  youre free the dalekhumans are failures  destruct destruct  destruct highpitched wail  no hybrids scream  no they cant they cant what happened what was that  they killed them rather than let them live  an entire species  genocide  only two of the daleks have been destroyed  one of the dalek masters must still be alive  oh yes  in the whole universe  just one  now what you will be exterminated  yeah yeah think about it dalek whats your name  dalek caan  dalek caan  your entire species has been wiped out  and now the cult of skaro has been eradicated  leaving only you  right now youre facing the only man in the universe who might show you some compassion  cos ive just seen one genocide  i wont cause another  caan  let me help you  what do you say  emergency temporal shift  argh doctor  doctor hes sick laszlo pants  its ok youre all right  his hearts racing like mad ive never seen anything like it  what is it doctor whats the matter with him  he says he cant breathe what is it  its time sweetheart  what do you mean time what are you talking about  none of the slaves survive for long  most of them only lived for a few weeks i was lucky  i held on cos i had you but now  im dying tallulah no youre not  not now after all this doctor cant you do something  oh tallulah with three ls and an h  just you watch me what do i need  oh how about a great big genetic laboratory  oh look ive got one laszlo just you hold on  theres been too many deaths today way too many people have died  brandnew creatures and wise old men and ageold enemies  and im telling you im telling you right now  i am not having one more death  have you got that not one  tallulah out of the way the doctor is in  well i talked to them i told them what solomon wouldve said  and i reckon i shamed one or two of them what did they say  theyll give you a home laszlo  i mean er dont imagine people aint gonna stare  i cant promise youll be at peace  but in the end that is what hooverville is for   people who aint got nowhere else  thank you  i i cant thank you enough  dyou reckon its gonna work those two  i dont know  anywhere else in the universe i might worry about them  but new york thats what this citys good at  give me your tired your poor your huddled masses  and maybe the odd pig slave dalek mutant hybrid too  she laughs the pig and the showgirl  the pig and the showgirl  just proves it i suppose theres someone for everyone  maybe  meant to say  im sorry what for  just cos that dalek got away i know what that means to you mmm  dyou think youll ever see it again oh yes  one day  tonight im going to perform a miracle  somethings wrong im 76 years old and i am reborn  this is a friend of mine lovely to meet you mrs jones tish  you people are in serious danger get out of here right now  screaming  no get away from her  just one more
