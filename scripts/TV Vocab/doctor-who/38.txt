danger  all of us in fact not just the country but the whole world  no i beg of you hear me out what are you talking about  your husband is not who he says he is im sorry  but its a lie  everythings a lie  im voting saxon  he can tick my box any day  vote saxon go harry  i think mr saxon is exactly what this country needs  hes a very fine man  and hes handsome too  former minister of defence first came to prominence when he shot down the racnoss on christmas eve  but he goes back years hes famous everyone knows the story  look  cambridge university rugby blue won the athletics thing  wrote a novel went into business marriage everything  hes got a whole life  all of it the school days his degree even his mother and father  its all invented  look harold saxon never went to cambridge  there was no harold saxon  the thing is its obvious  the forgery is screaming out and yet noone can see it  its as if hes mesmerised the entire world  i think perhaps you should leave now   this is his first honest to god appearance  just after the downfall of harriet jones  and at the exact same time they launched the archangel network  mrs rook now stop it even now theyve said that the  the cabinets gone into seclusion  what does that mean seclusion how should i know  but ive got plenty of research on you  yes good family roedean not especially bright  but essentially harmless  and thats why im asking you lucy i am begging you  if you have seen anything heard anything  even the slightest thing that would give you cause to doubt him i think  yes  there was a time when we first met i wondered  but he was so good to my father and he said  what just tell me sweetheart the thing is  i made my choice im sorry  for better or for worse  isnt that right harry  my faithful companion  mr saxon  prime minister i was just  having a little joke with poor little lucy i didnt mean  oh but youre absolutely right  harold saxon doesnt exist  then tell me  who are you i am the master  and these are my friends  im sorry  cant you hear it mrs rook  what dyou mean  the drumbeat  the drums are coming closer  and closer  the lady doesnt like us no  silly lady no  dead lady  screaming continues  harry she knew everything  you promised you said archangel was 100  um 99 98  but if shes asking questions then who else  how much time have we got  tomorrow morning i promise  thats when everything ends  but hes got the tardis  maybe the master went back in time and has been living here for decades  no why not worked for me  when he was stealing the tardis all i could do was fuse the coordinates  i locked them permanently  he can only travel between the year 100000000000 and the last place the tardis landed  which is right here right now yeah but a little leeway  well 18 months  tops the most he could have been here is 18 months  so hows he managed all this  the master was always sort of hypnotic  but this is on a massive scale  i was gonna vote for him really well it was before i even met you  and i liked him me too  why dyou say that  what was his policy what did he stand for  i dunno he always sounded good  like you could trust him  just nice  he spoke about  i cant really remember but it was good  just the sound of his voice whats that what  that that tapping what are you doing  i dont know its nothing its just i dont know  intro music blares  our lord and

tell you what though  no mention of leo hes not as daft as he looks  im talking about my brother on the run how did this happen  nice chips actually theyre not bad  so doctor  who is he  how come the ancient society of time lords created a psychopath  and what is he to you like a colleague or a friend at first  i thought you were gonna say he was your secret brother or something  youve been watching too much tv  all the legends of gallifrey made it sound so perfect well perfect to look at maybe  and it was it was beautiful  they used to call it the shining world of the seven systems  and on the continent of wild endeavour  in the mountains of solace and solitude  there stood the citadel of the time lords  the oldest and most mighty race in the universe  looking down on the galaxies below  sworn never to interfere  only to watch  children of gallifrey  taken from their families at the age of eight to enter the academy  some say thats where it all began  when he was a child  thats when the master saw eternity  as a novice he was taken for initiation  he stood in front of the untempered schism   its a gap in the fabric of reality  through which could be seen the whole of the vortex  you stand there  eight years old  staring at the raw power of time and space just a child  some would be inspired  some would run away  and some would go mad  oh i dont know what about you  oh the ones that ran away  i never stopped  beeping  encrypted channel with files attached  dont recognise it patch it through to the laptop  um since were telling stories theres something i havent told you  you work for torchwood its changed theres only half a dozen of us now  everything torchwood did and youre part of it the old regime was destroyed at canary wharf  i rebuilt it i changed it and when i did that i did it for you in your honour  if i havent returned to my desk by 2200 this file will be emailed to torchwood  which means if youre watching this then im  anyway the saxon files are attached  but take a look at the archangel document  thats when it all started when harry saxon  became minister in charge of launching the archangel network  whats the archangel network  ive got archangel everyone does the mobile phone network look  its gone worldwide  even the other networks theyre all carried by archangel  its in the phones oh i said he was a hypnotist  wait wait wait hold on  rhythmic beeping there it is  that rhythm its everywhere  ticking away in the subconscious  what is it mind control no subtler than that any stronger and people would question it  but contained in that rhythm in layers of code vote saxon believe in me  whispering to the world oh yes thats how he hid himself from me  i shouldve sensed another time lord on earth but the signal cancelled him out  any way you can stop it not from down here  but now we know how hes doing it we can fight back oh yes  three tardis keys with lowlevel perception properties because the tardis is designed to blend in  well sort of but now the archangel networks got a second lowlevel signal  weld the key to the network and martha look at me you can see me yes yep  what about now  jack laughs  no im here look at me  its like i know youre there but i dont want to know  back again see it just shifts your perception a tiny bit  doesnt make us invisible just unnoticed  oh i know what its like its like  its like when you fancy someone and they dont even know you exist  thats what its like  come on  you too huh  dont run  dont shout just keep your voice down  draw attention to yourself and the spell is broken  just keep to the shadows  like ghosts yeah thats what we are  ghosts  and as the eyes of the world turn towards great britain  sources indicate that air force one has landed on british soil tonight  mr president sir  mr saxon the british army will stand down  from now on unit has control of this operation  you make it sound like an invasion  the first contact policy was decided by the security council in 1968 and youve just ignored it  well you know what its like  new job all that paperwork  i think its down the back of the settee i had a quick look  i found a pen a sweet a bus ticket and er have you met the wife  im not sure what your game is but there are provisions at the un to have you removed from office  unless you are very very careful is that understood  are you taking this seriously  to business weve accessed your files on these toclafane  but first contact cannot take place on any sovereign soil  to that purpose aircraft carrier valiant is en route  the rendezvous will take place there at 8am  he mumbles  youre trying my patience sir  so america is completely in charge  since britain elected an ass yes see you on board the valiant  it still will be televised though

people of the world  i stand before you today as ambassador for humanity  a role i will undertake with the utmost solemnity  perhaps our toclafane cousins can offer us much  but what is important is
