and female suspects escaped wasteridge corridor  mr halpen i found the doctor hes heading for ood conversion  on my way mr kess whats the situation  weve contained it sir fenced them in but the red eye seems to be permanent this time its not fading  worse than that sir theres more of them going rabid  my opinion sir i think weve lost them the entire batch contaminated  whats causing it why now whats changed  how many ood in total id say about 2000 sir  we can write them off thats what insurance is for  drink weve plenty more on the breeding farms lets start again  fetch the canisters no survivors  my pleasure sir you lot  canisters  oh can you hear it  i didnt need the map i shouldve listened  hold on does that mean were locked in listen  listen listen listen listen eerie singing  oh my head  what is it cant you hear it  the singing  they sing  they look different to the others  thats because theyre naturalborn ood unprocessed  before theyre adapted to slavery unspoilt  singing continues  thats their song i cant hear it  dyou want to  yeah  its the song of captivity let me hear it  face me  open your mind thats it  clear sad singing hear it donna  hear the music oh  singing continues  take it away  you sure  i cant bear it  im sorry  thats ok  but you can still hear it  all the time  whats the holdup its the experimentation lab maximum security hes fused the system  dont just stand there get the boltcutters rip that door off solana go back to the reps  i dont want any of them wandering off and seeing this and get them away from the ood just in case  hurry up yes sir  metallic thud theyre breaking in  ah let them  what are you holding show me  friend  doctor donna friend  let me see look at me  let me see  thats it thats it go on go on  is that  its a brain a hind brain  the ood are born with a secondary brain like the amygdala in humans  it processes memory and emotions get rid of that and you wouldnt be donna any more youd be like an ood  a processed ood so the company cuts off their brains  and they stitch on the translator  like a lobotomy  i spent all that time looking for you doctor  because i thought it would be so wonderful out here  i want to go home  thud  theyre with the ood sir what you gonna do then arrest me  lock me up throw me in a cage well youre too late hah  why dont you just come out and say it foto activists  if thats what friends of the ood are trying to prove yes the ood were nothing without us  just animals roaming on the ice thats because you cant hear them they welcomed it  its not as if they put up a fight you idiot  theyre born with their brains in their hands dont you see  that makes them peaceful theyve got to be  cos a creature like that would have to trust anyone it meets oh nice one thank you  the systems worked for 200 years all weve got is a rogue batch  but the infection is about to be sterilised mr kess  how do we stand canisters primed sir  as soon as the core heats up the gas is released  give it 200 marks and counting  youre gonna gas them kill the livestock  the classic footandmouth solution from the olden days  still works  chuckling  eerie singing  singing continues  im sorry if i could ask you one more time could all the reps please  come through to the education suites why move now its a free bar  could i ask all the ood to withdraw its feeding time  aw youve upset them leave them alone  i have to insist if all the ood could please leave  ladies and gentlemen change of plan if you could leave by the fire exits  i could sell this you could offer different colours  aaargh  aargh  aargh  theyve gone insane miss theyve gone mad all of them  just shoot them shoot to kill  alarm sounds what the hell  whats going on out there  emergency status emergency status all exits sealed  its a revolution  bleeping  come back let me out of here  aargh  no reports of trouble offworld sir its still contained to the oodsphere  weve got a public duty to stop it  everything you wanted no doubt therell be a full police investigation once this place  has been sterilised so i cant risk a bullet to the head ill leave you to the mercies of the ood  but theres something else isnt there something we havent seen what  a creature couldnt survive with a separate fore brain and hind brain theyd be at war with themselves  theres got to be a third element so clever its got to be connected to the redeye what is it  it wont exist for very much longer  enjoy your ood  come on  dr ryder warehouse 15 well what about this one  no youve not turned faithful to the last  go join your people while you still can  come on  well do something youre the one with all the tricks  you mustve met houdini these are really good handcuffs  oh well im glad of that  i mean at least weve got quality  doors open  doctor donna  friends the circle must be broken doctor donna  friends the circle must be broken  doctor donna friends the circle must be broken friends friends friends the circle must be broken  doctor donna friends the circle must be broken friends friends friends  doctor donna friends  friends the circle must  eerie singing  doctor donna friends  yes thats us friends oh yes  no leave him  i dont know where it is i dont know where theyve gone  what are we looking for  might be underground like some sort of cave or a cavern or  warehouse 15 door open  all right  its always been an option my grandfather drew up this plan  thats the advantage of a familyrun business dr ryder the personal touch but we should evacuate  if we can get to the rocket sheds no need weve got this  detonation packs place them around the circumference  were gonna blow it up  this thing dies so do the ood  bleeping  sad singing  the ood brain  now it all makes sense thats the missing link the third element  binding them together fore brain hind brain and this   the telepathic centre  its a shared mind connecting all the ood in song  cargo i can always go into cargo  ive got the rockets ive got the sheds smaller business much more manageable without livestock  hes mined the area theyre gonna kill it  they found thatthing centuries ago beneath the northern glacier  those pylons in a circle the circle must be broken damping the telepathic field  stopping the ood from connecting for 200 years  and you ood sigma you brought them here i expected better  haha still subservient  good ood  if that barrier things in place how come the ood started breaking out  maybe its taken centuries to adapt the subconscious reaching out  but the process was too slow had to be accelerated  you should never have given me access to the controls mr halpen i lowered the barrier to its minimum  friends of the ood sir  its taken me ten years to infiltrate the company  and i succeeded  yes yes you did  aargh  you murdered him  very observant ginger  now then  cant say ive ever shot anyone before  cant say im gonna like it  but its not exactly a normal day is it still  would you like a drink sir  i think hair loss is the least of my problems right now thanks  please have a drink sir if if youre going to stand in their way  ill shoot you too  please have a drink sir  have have you poisoned me  natural ood must never kill sir what is that stuff  oodgraft suspended in a biological compound sir what the hell does that mean  oh dear tell me  funny thing the subconscious takes all sorts of shapes  it came out in the redeye as revenge came out in the rabid ood as anger  and then there was patience  all that intelligence and mercy focused on ood sigma  hows that hair loss mr halpen  what have you done  oh theyve been preparing you for a very long time  now youre standing next to the ood brain mr halpen can you hear it  listen  eerie singing  what have you  imnot  he drops gun  they they turned him into an ood  hes an ood  i noticed  he has become oodkind  and we will take care of him  its weird being with you i cant tell whats right and whats wrong any more  its better that way people who know for certain tend to be like mr halpen  beeping ooh  thats better and now  sigma would you allow me the honour  it is yours doctor oh yes  stifled for 200 years  but not any more the circle is broken the ood can sing  joyous singing  i can hear it  singing continues  the message has gone out  that song resonated across the galaxies everyone heard it  the rockets are bringing them back  the ood are coming home  we thank you doctordonna  friends of oodkind  and what of you now will you stay  there is room in the song for you  oh ive  sort of got a song of my own thanks  i think your song must end soon  meaning every song must end  yeah  erm what about you  you still want to go home no  definitely not  then well be off take this song with you we will  always  and know this doctordonna
