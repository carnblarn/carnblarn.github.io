victoria  empress of india and defender of the faith  rose tyler maam and my apologies  for being so naked  ive had five daughters its nothing to me  but you doctor   show me these credentials  why didnt you say so immediately  it states clearly here that you have been appointed by the lord provost as my protector  does it yes it does good good  then let me ask whys your majesty travelling by road when theres a train all the way to aberdeen  a tree on the line an accident  i am the queen of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland  everything around me tends to be planned  an assassination attempt  what seriously theres people out to kill ya  im used to staring down the barrel of a gun  sir robert macleish lives but ten miles hence  weve sent word ahead  hell shelter us then well reach balmoral tomorrow  this doctor and his timorous beastie will come with us  yes maam wed better get moving its almost nightfall  indeed and there are stories of wolves in these parts  fanciful tales intended to scare the children  but good for the blood i think drive on  its funny cos you say assassination and you just think of kennedy and stuff  not er 1879 shes had ooh  six attempts on her life and ill tell you something else  we just met queen victoria i know   what a laugh she was just sitting there  like a stamp i want her to say we are not amused   bet you five quid i can make her say it  if i gambled itd be an abuse of my privilege as a traveller in time  ten quid done  i cant do this its treason  then your wife will suffer the consequences  and believe me sir robert  she will be devoured  your majesty sir robert  my apologies for the emergency  and how is lady isobel  shes   indisposed im afraid  shes gone to edinburgh for the season  shes taken the cook the kitchens are barely stocked  i wouldnt blame your majesty if you wanted to ride on no  ive had quite enough carriage exercise and this is  charming    if rustic its my first visit to this house  my late husband spoke of it often  the torchwood estate  now shall we go inside  and please excuse the naked girl  sorry shes a feral child i bought her for sixpence in old london town  it was her or the elephant man  thinks hes funny but im so not amused what do you think maam  it hardly matters  shall we proceed  so close  mackeson and ramsay you will escort the property hurry up yes sir  so whats in there then  property of the crown  you will dismiss any further thoughts sir  the rest of you go to the rear  assume your designated positions  you heard the orders positions sir  shhhhh  guard it with your life  this i take it is the famous endeavour  all my fathers work  built by hand in his final years  it became something of an obsession  he spent his money on this rather than caring for the house or himself  i wish id met him i like him  that things beautiful can i    help yourself  what did he model it on i know nothing about it  to be honest most of us thought him    shall we say eccentric hah  i wish now id spent more time with him and listened to his stories  its a bit rubbish how many prisms has it got  way too many the magnifications gone right over the top thats a stupid  am i being rude again yep  but its pretty  its very pretty and the imagination of it should be applauded  i thought you might disapprove your majesty  star gazing  isnt that a bit fanciful  you could easily   not be amused or something no  this device surveys the infinite work of god  what could be finer  sir roberts father was an example to us all a polymath  steeped in astronomy and the sciences yet equally well versed in folklore and fairytales  stars and magic i like him more and more  oh my late husband enjoyed his company  prince albert himself was acquainted with many rural superstitions coming as he did from saxecoburg  thats bavaria  when albert was told about your local wolf he was transported  whats this wolf then its just a story then tell it  its said   excuse me sir    perhaps her majestys party could repair to their rooms  its almost dark  of course yes of course and then supper  and could we find some clothes for miss tyler  im tired of nakedness  its not amusing is it  sir robert your wife must have left some clothes see to it  we shall dine at seven and talk some more of this wolf  after all there is a full moon tonight  so there is maam  ughhh  they came through the house  in silence took the steward and the master and my lady  listen ive got a friend  hes called the doctor  hell know what to do  come with me oh but i cant miss  whats your name  flora  flora well be safe  theres more people arrived downstairs they can help us  i promise come on  ok come on  oh miss i did warn you  hes not dead i dont think  he must be drugged or something  agggh agggh  your companion begs an apology  her clothing has somewhat delayed her  thats all right save her a bit of ham  the feral child could probably eat it raw  ha very wise maam  very witty  slightly witty perhaps  i know you rarely get the chance to dine with me captain but dont get too excited  i shall contain my wit in case i do you further injury yes maam  sorry maam were all waiting on sir robert  come sir you promised us a tale of nightmares  indeed since my husbands death i find myself with more of a taste for supernatural fiction  you must miss him  very much  oh completely  and thats the charm of a ghost story isnt it  not the scares and the chills thats just for children but the    hope of some contact with the great beyond  we all want some message from that place  its the creators greatest mystery that were allowed no such consolation  the dead stay silent  and we must wait  but come begin your tale sir robert  theres a chill in the air  the wind is howling through the eaves tell us of monsters  dont make a sound  they said if we scream or shout then he will slaughter us  but   hes in a cage  hes a prisoner hes the same as us  hes nothing like us  that creatures not mortal  the story goes back 300 years  every full moon the howling rings through the valley  next morning livestock is found ripped apart and  devoured  tales like this just disguise the work of thieves  steal a sheep blame a wolf simple as that  but sometimes a child goes missing  once in a generation a boy will vanish from his homestead  dont child  who are you dont enrage him  where are you from  youre not from earth  what planet are you from ohhh  intelligence  where were you born  this body  ten miles away  a weakling heartsick boy  stolen away at night by the brethren for my  cultivation  i carved out his soul and sat in his heart  are there descriptions of the creature oh yes doctor  drawings and wood carvings  and its not merely a wolf  its more than that  this is a man who becomes an animal  a werewolf  all right so the bodys human  what about you  the thing inside  so far from home  if you want to get back home we can help  why would i leave this place  a world of industry of workforce and warfare  i could turn it to such purpose how would you do that  i would migrate to the holy monarch  you mean queen victoria with one bite i would pass into her blood  and then it begins the empire of the wolf  many questions  look  inside your eyes youve seen it too  seen what the wolf there is something of the wolf about you  i dont know what you mean  you burnt like the sun  but all i require is the moon  my father didnt treat it as a story  he said it was fact  he even claimed to have communed with the beast  to have learned its purpose  i should have listened  his work was hindered he made enemies  theres a monastery in the glen of st catherine  the brethren opposed my fathers investigations  perhaps they thought his work ungodly thats what i thought  but now i wonder  what if they had a different reason for wanting the story kept quiet  what if they turned from god  and worshipped the wolf  and what if they were with us right now  moonlight    all of you stop looking at it flora dont look listen to me  grab hold of the chain and pull come on with me pull  we cant miss we cant the brethren   i said pull stop your whining and

sorry maam  its all my fault  i should have sent you away  i tried to suggest something was wrong  i thought you might notice  was there nothing strange about my household staff  they were bald athletic  your wifes away i thought you were happy  i tell you what maam i bet youre not amused now do you think this funny  no im sorry  what exactly i pray tell me someone please what exactly is that creature  youd call it a werewolf but its more of a lupine wavelength haemovariform  should i trust you sir you who change your voice so easily  what happened to your accent  oh right sorry    ill not have it  no sir not you not that thing none of it  this is not my world  mistletoe theyre all garlanded in mistletoe and the wolf doesnt attack them  who brought this into the kitchen must have been the brethren  gather it up quickly  every last scrap quick now  mistletoe  did your father put that there  i dont know i suppose  on the other door too though a carving wouldnt be enough  i wonder    viscum album the oil of the mistletoe its been worked into the wood like a varnish  how clever was your dad i love him   powerful stuff mistletoe bursting with viscotoxins  and the wolfs allergic to it or it thinks it is  maybe its the way the monks control the wolf  nevertheless that creature wont give up doctor and we still dont possess an actual weapon  your father got all the brains being rude again  good i meant that one you want weapons  were in a library books  best weapons in the world  this rooms the greatest arsenal we could have arm yourself  theres no sound of the wolf my lady perhaps its gone  and perhaps its toying with us  my husbands up there if theres any chance hes still alive then by god ill assist him  look up biology zoology there might be something on wolves   what about this  a book on mistletoe we need magic  if we could make explosives    thats the sort of thing ooh  look what your old dad found  something fell to earth  a spaceship shooting star  in the year of our lord 1540 under the reign of king james v an almighty fire did burn in the pit   thats the glen of saint catherine by the monastery  thats 300 years ago whats it been waiting for  maybe a single cell survived  adapting slowly down the generations it survived  through the humans host after host after host  why does it want the throne  thats what it wants it said so  the empire of the wolf imagine it  the victorian age accelerated   starships and missiles fuelled by coal and driven by steam    leaving history devastated in its wake  sir robert  if i am to die here    dont say that your majesty  i would destroy myself rather than let that creature infect me  but thats no matter i ask only that you might find some place of  safekeeping for something far older and more precious than myself  hardly time to worry about your valuables  thank you for your opinion  but there is nothing more valuable than this  oh your majesty  is that the kohinoor oh yes  the greatest diamond in the world  given to me as the spoils of war  perhaps its legend is now coming true  it is said that whoever owns it must surely die  thats true of anything if you wait long enough can i  that is so beautiful how much is that worth  they say the wages of the entire planet for a whole week  my mumd be fighting the wolf off with her bare hands for that thing  and shed win where is the wolf  i dont trust this silence why dyou travel with it  my annual pilgrimage  im taking it to hellier and carew  the royal jewellers at hazlehead  the stone needs recutting  but its perfect  my late husband never thought so theres a fact  prince albert kept on having it cut down  used to be 40 bigger than this  but he was never happy  kept on cutting and cutting  he always said the shine was not quite right  but he died with it still unfinished  unfinished    oh yes theres a lot of unfinished business here  his fathers research   and your husband maam he came here  hold on all these separate things theyre not separate at all theyre connected my head  this house its a trap for you is that right  obviously thats what the wolf intended  but what if theres a trap inside the trap  explain what if his father and your husband werent just telling each other stories  they dared to imagine all this was true laying the real trap not for you but for the wolf  grrrrr grrrrr  that wolf there  glass cracks out out out out  grrrrrr  gotta get to the observatory  grrrrrr grrrrrr aghhhhhh   aghhhhhh grrrr  good shot it was mistletoe  isobel   now get back downstairs  keep yourself safe  my love now go  girls come with me  down the back stairs back to the kitchens  come on the observatorys this way  no mistletoe here cos your father wanted the wolf inside  is there any way of barricading this  do your work and ill defend it  if we could bind them shut    i said ill find you time sir  now get inside  good man  your majesty the diamond  for what purpose the purpose it was designed for  wolf growls  rose    lift it come on  its not the right time for stargazing    oh yes it is    grrrrr grrrrr grrrrr  i committed treason for you  but now my wife  will remember me with honour  grrrrr grrrrr aghhhhhh  thought you said this doesnt work it doesnt work as a telescope  its a light chamber   its like a weapon  weve just got to power it up with what theres no electricity  moonlight but the wolf needs moonlight its made by moonlight  youre 70 water  you can still drown come on  come on  grrrrrr grrrrrr  make it brighter  let me go  wolf howls  your majesty  did it bite you  no its   its a cut thats all  if that thing bit you    it was a splinter of wood when the door came apart its nothing  let me see it is nothing  by the power invested in me by the church and the state i dub thee sir doctor of tardis  by the power invested in me by the church and the state i dub thee  dame rose of the powell estate  you may stand  many thanks maam theyre never gonna believe this back home  your majesty you said last night about receiving no message from the great beyond  i think your husband cut that diamond to save your life  hes protecting you even now maam  from beyond the grave indeed  then you may think on this also that i am not amused  yes  not remotely amused  and henceforth i banish you  im sorry  i have rewarded you sir doctor and now you are exiled from this empire never to return  i dont know what you are  or where youre from  but i know that you consort with stars and magic and think it fun  but your world is steeped in terror and blasphemy and death  and i will not allow it  you will leave these shores  and you will reflect i hope on how you came to stray so far from all that is good  and how much longer you may survive this terrible life  now leave my world  and never return  whoa  cheers dougal  the funny thing is queen victoria actually did suffer a mutation of the blood  its historical fact  she was haemophiliac  but its always been a mystery  she didnt inherit it it came from nowhere  youre saying thats a wolf bite  well maybe haemophilias just a victorian euphemism  for werewolf could be  queen victorias a werewolf  could be and her children had the disease  maybe she gave them a quick nip  so the royal family are werewolves  well maybe not yet a single wolf cell could take a hundred years to mature  might be ready by ooh    early 21st century  nah thats just ridiculous  mind you princess anne   ill say no more  and if you think about it  theyre very private  they plan everything in advance  they could schedule themselves around the moon  and  they like hunting  they love blood sports  oh my god theyre werewolves  they both howl  what will you do will you stay here  i dont think i could  id sell it  or pull this place down  although we may not speak of these events in public they will not be forgotten  i promise you that  your husbands sacrifice  the ingenuity of his father  they will live on but how  i saw last night that great britain has enemies beyond imagination  and we must defend our borders on all sides  i propose  an institute  to investigate these strange happenings and to fight them  i would call it torchwood  the torchwood institute  and if this doctor should return then he should beware  because torchwood will be waiting  good morning class are we sitting comfortably  it turns
