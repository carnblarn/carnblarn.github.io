                theres still no word from inside downing street     though we are getting even more new arrivals  we are the slitheen  reduce the earth to molten slag then sell it  leave this planet or ill stop you  the world is in your hands  ive checked the figures ive checked them again and again  always the same result  the design is not safe it could result in the death of millions  i beg of you stop the project right now before its too late  well  goodness me  obviously mr cleaver youre the expert  then youll stop it  it seems i have no choice  gurgling  oh   do excuse me  civic duties leave little time for a sandwich  but you promise youll stop it today  well of course  nothing is more important than human life  what do you take me for some sort of maniac  why no  am i right in thinking youve shown your results only to me  just to you noone else  wise move  this is such a weight off my mind  ive barely slept i couldnt believe my own readings  the scale of it    destruction like the british isles has never seen before  if i didnt know better id almost think that someone wanted this project to go wrong  as though they intended this city should be wiped off the map  thank goodness weve got you our esteemed leader  who the hell are you what do you mean who the hell am i  who the hell are you captain jack harkness get out of my way  dont tell me this must be mickey  here comes trouble how are you doing ricky boy its mickey  dont listen to him hes winding you up you look fantastic  aw sweet how come i never get any of that buy me a drink first youre such hard work but worth it  did you manage to find it  there you go i can go anywhere now  you dont need a passport its all very well going to platform one in justicia and the glass pyramid  but what if we end up in brazil i might need it you see im prepared for anything  it sounds like youre staying then  so what are you doing in cardiff and who the hells jumping jack flash  i dont mind you hanging out with big ears there   oi look in the mirror   but this guy hes kinda   handsome more like cheesy  early 21stcentury slang is cheesy good or bad its bad  but bad means good isnt that right  are you saying im not handsome we just stopped off we need to refuel  cardiffs got a rift through the middle of the city  its like an earthquake fault between different dimensions the rift was healed back in 1869  thanks to a girl named gwyneth she saved the world and closed it  but closing a rift leaves a scar and that scar generates energy harmless to the human race    but perfect for the tardis i park on top of the scar   open up the engines soak up the radiation    like filling her up with petrol and off we go into time and space  my god have you seen yourselves you all think youre so clever dont you yep yeah yup  itll take another 24 hours so weve got time to kill  that old ladys staring probably wondering what four people can do inside a small wooden box  what are you captain of  the innuendo squad  wait er the tardis doesnt it get noticed  yeah why does it look like that its a cloaking device  its called a chameleon circuit the tardis is meant to disguise itself wherever it lands  i landed in the 1960s it disguised itself as a police box and the circuit got stuck  there actually was police boxes  yeah before they had radios theyd phone for help if they arrested someone they could put em inside  why dont you just fix the circuit i like it dont you i love it  theres no police boxes any more so doesnt it get noticed  ricky you put a mysterious blue box slap bang in the middle of town what do people do walk past it  now stop your nagging lets go and explore  whats the plan i dont know cardiff early 21st century  and the winds coming from the  east trust me the safest place in the universe  this nuclear power station right in the heart of cardiff city will bring jobs for all  as you can see as lord mayor ive had to sanction some radical redevelopments  no photographs what did i say  take pictures of the project by all means but not me thank you  so    cardiff castle will be demolished allowing the blaidd drwg project to rise up tall and proud  a monument to welsh industry  and yes some of you might shiver  the words nuclear power station  and major population centre arent exactly the happiest of bedfellows  but i give you my personal guarantee  that as long as i walk upon this earth no harm will come to any of my citizens  now drink up a toast    to the future the future  and believe me    it will glow  excuse me my names cathy salt i represent the cardiff gazette im sorry im not doing interviews  but are you aware of the curse  whatever do you mean cathy wasnt it  some of your engineers are saying that the blaidd drwg project is cursed sounds rather silly to me  thats what i thought  but the funny thing is it does look a bit odd  in what way the number of deaths associated with this project   the entire team of european safety inspectors  they were french and danger explosives was only written in welsh  and the accident with the cardiff heritage committee the electrocutio of that swimming pool was accidental  and then the architect  it was raining visibility was low my car simply couldnt stop  and then recently mr cleaver the governments nuclear adviser slippe on an icy patch he was decapitated  it was a very icy patch these stories are nothing more than typical smalltown thinking excuse me  before he died mr cleaver posted some of his findings online did he  he was concerned about the reactor oh all that technical stuff  specifically that the design of the suppression pool would cause the hydrogen recombiners to fail  precipitating the collapse of the containment system causing meltdown youve done your homework  thats my job  i think  cathy salt     i think you and i should have a word in private  gurgling  oh my little tummys complaining we might have to make a detour to the ladies ill wait here  oh come on all girls together  so you were saying these outlandish theories of yours  gurgling  it sounds like we got here just in time continue well i dont know much about nuclear physics  but from what i could make out cleaver was saying the whole project could go up worse than chernobyl  is there something wrong with the lights  oh theyre always on the blink i cant tell you how many memos ive sent  so  chernobyl  apparently but a thousand times worse  i mean it sounds absurd there must be so many safety regulations  but cleaver seemed to be talking about a nuclear holocaust he almost made it sound deliberate  were hardly the sunday times were only the cardiff gazette but we do have a duty to report the facts  and youre going to print this information are you all right you sound a bit   sore throat  ahem just a little tickle  but tell me do you intend to make this information public i have to  so be it  mind you my boyfriend thinks im mad were getting married next month  and he says i could lose my job just when we need the money  boyfriend jeffrey civil servant    hes nothing exciting but hes mine whens the wedding  the 19th its really just to stop my mother from nagging but the baby sort of clinched it  youre with child  three months its not showing yet  it wasnt planned it was an accident  nice accident though  congratulations thank you how about you  no  is there a mr blaine  not any more  im all on my own  i had quite a sizeable family once upon a time wonderful brothers    oh they were bold  but all of them gone now  maybe youre right maybe im cursed  oh no i dont think so not really  youre very kind  er    if you dont mind i might be a while  you run along perhaps we could do this another day  are you all right fine  ok i tell you what ill leave my details with your office thanks for talking  thank you  oh    oh    youre lying through your teeth  i swear it turns out the white things are tusks and i mean tusks and its woken and its not happy  how could you not know it was there nothing to do with me  then it roars and we are running brakovitch falls so i say    i knew we shouldve turned left thats my line  i dont believe a word you say that is so brilliant  did you ever get your clothes back  no i just picked him up and went right for the ship full throttle i mean i was shaking  it was unbelievable it freaked me out    and i was having such a nice day  according to intelligence the target is the last surviving member of the slitheen family  a criminal sect from the planet raxacoricofallapatorious masquerading as a human being  ok plan of attack we assume a basic 5756 strategy covering all available exits on the ground floor  doctor you go face to face thatll designate exit 1 ill cover exit 2 rose exit 3 mickey smith exit 4  excuse me whos in charge  sorry awaiting orders sir  right heres the plan  like he said nice plan anything else present arms  ready ready ready  speed dial yep ready check see you in hell  hello ive come to see the lord mayor  have you got an appointment  no just an old friend passing by bit of a surprise i cant wait to see her face shesjust having tea  just go in there and tell her the doctor would like to see her  doctor who just the doctor  tell her exactly that the doctor  hang on a tick  china smashes  er the lord mayor says thank you for popping by  shed love to have a chat but em   shes up to her eyes in paperwork  perhaps if you could make an appointment for next week  shes climbing out of the window isnt she yes she is  slitheen heading north on my way over and out  oh my god  leave the mayor alone  margaret  whos on exit 4  that was mickey here i am  mickey the idiot oh be fair shes not exactly gonna outrun us is she  shes got a teleport thats cheating  oh the doctors very good at teleports  i could do this all day this is persecution why cant you leave me alone what did i ever do to you  you tried to kill me and destroy this entire planet apart from that  so youre a slitheen youre on earth youre trapped  your family get killed but you teleport out  you have no means of escape what do you do you build a nuclear power station but what for  a philanthropic gesture ive learnt the error of my ways and it just so happens to be on top of the rift  what rift would that be a rift in space and time if this went into meltdown the entire planet would    this station is designed to explode the minute it reaches capacity  didnt anyone notice doesnt anyone in london check this stuff  were in cardiff london doesnt care south wales could fall into the sea and they wouldnt notice  oh i sound like a welshman  god help me ive gone native  but why would she do that shed only end up killing herself   shes got a name  shes a thing not a she  oh but shes clever  fantastic is that a tribophysical waveform macrokinetic extrapolator couldnt have put it better myself  ooh genius you didnt build this i have my hobbies  no you really didnt build this way beyond you i bet she stole it  it fell into my hands is it a weapon its transport  you see if the reactor blows the rift opens phenomenal cosmic disaster  but this thing shrouds you in a force field you have this energy bubble so youre safe  you ride the concussion all the way out of the solar system  its a surfboard a pandimensional surfboard  id have surfed away from this deadend dump back to civilisation  youd blow up a planet to get a lift  like stepping on an anthill  how did you think of the name what blaidd drwg its welsh  i know but how did you think of it i chose it at random thats all  i dunno it just sounded good does it matter  blaidd drwg whats it mean bad wolf  ive heard that before bad wolf ive heard that lots of times  everywhere we go two words following us  bad wolf how can they be following us  nah just a coincidence like hearing a word on the radio then hearing it all day never mind  margaret were gonna take you home hold on like letting her go  i dont believe it we actually get to go to raxa    wait a minute raxacori   raxacoricofallapatorious  raxacorico   fallapatorious  raxacoricofallapatorious thats it i did it  they have the death penalty  the family slitheen was tried in its absence many years ago and found guilty  with no chance of appeal  according to the statutes the moment i return i am to be executed  what do you make of that doctor  take me home and you take me to my death not my problem  this ship is impossible  its superb how do you get the outside around the inside  like id give you the secret yeah  i almost feel better about being defeated  we never stood a chance this is the technology of the gods  id make a very bad god you wouldnt get a day off for starters  jack are how we doing  this extrapolators top of the range  where did you get it i dont know some airlock sale  it must have been a great big heist its stacked with power but we can use it for fuel  its not compatible but it should knock off about 12 hours well be ready to go by morning  then were stuck here overnight  im in no hurry  weve got a prisoner the police box is really a police box  youre not just police though  since youre taking me to my death that makes you my executioners  each and every one of you  well you deserve it  youre very quick to say so  youre very quick to soak your hands in my blood which makes you better than me how exactly  long night ahead  lets see who can look me in the eye  its freezing out here  better than in there  she does deserve it shes a slitheen i dont care  its just  weird in that box  i didnt really need my passport  ive been thinking you know we could  go have a drink  have a pizza or something just you and me thatd be nice  and i mean if the tardis cant leave until morning we could     go to a hotel spend the night  i mean if you want to ive got some money ok yeah  is that all right yeah  cool er  theres a couple of bars round here we should give em a go  do you have to go and tell him  its none of his business  so whats on  nothing just    i gather its not always like this  having to wait  i bet youre always the first to leave doctor  never mind the consequences off you go  you butchered my family and then ran for the stars am i right  but not this time  at last you have consequences  how does it feel i didnt butcher them  dont answer back thats what she wants i didnt  what about you you had an emergency teleport you didnt zap them to safety it only carries one  i had to fly without coordinates  i ended up in a skip on the isle of dogs haha  it wasnt funny  sorry  it is a bit funny  do i get a last request  depends what it is  i grew quite fond of my little human life all those rituals  the brushing of the teeth and the complicated way they cook things  theres a little restaurant just round the bay it became quite a favourite of mine  is that what you want a last meal  dont i have rights oh like shes not gonna try to escape  except i can never escape the doctor so wheres the danger  i wonder if you could do it  to sit with a creature youre about to kill and take supper  how strong is your stomach  strong enough i wonder  ive seen you fight your enemies  now dine with them  you wont change my mind prove it  there are people out there  if you slip away just for one second theyll be in danger except  ive got these  you both wear one if she moves more than ten feet away zzzt  she gets zapped by 10 000 volts  margaret would you like to come out to dinner my treat  dinner in bondage  it works for me  here we are out on a date and you havent even asked my proper name  its not a date  whats your name blon  im blon fel fotch passameerday slitheen  thats what itll say on my death certificate  nice to meet you blon  im sure  look thats where i was living as margaret a nice little flat over there on the top  next to the one with the light on  two bedrooms bayside view i was rather content  i dont suppose ill see it again  suppose not  thank you  pleasure  tell me then doctor what do you know of our species  only what ive seen  did you know for example in extreme cases when her life is in danger  a female raxacoricofallapatorian can manufacture a poison dart within her own finger  yes i did just checking  and one more thing  between you and me     as a final resort the excess poison can be exhaled through the lungs  thats better now then what dyou think mmm steak looks nice steak and chips  the doctor took me to this planet a while back  it was much colder than this they called it women wept  the planet was actually called women wept cos if you looked at it from above theres this huge continent  like all curved round it sort of looked like a woman lamenting  oh my god and we went to this beach right  no people no buildings just this beach like a thousand miles across  something had happened something to do with the sun i dont know but the sea had just frozen  like in a split second in the middle of a storm right  waves and foam just frozen all the way out to the horizon  midnight we walk underneath these waves a hundred feet tall and made of ice  im going out with trisha delaney  oh right  thats nice  trisha from the shop yeah rob delaneys sister  well shes nice  shes a bit big she lost weight  youve been away  well good for you shes nice  so tell us more about this planet then that was it really  public executions a slow death  they prepare a thin acetic acid lower me into the cauldron   and boil me  the acidity is perfectly gauged to strip away the skin  internal organs fall out into the liquid  and i become soup  and still alive  still screaming i dont make the law but you deliver it  will you stay to watch  what else can i do  the slitheen familys huge theres a lot more of us all scattered offworld take me to them  take me somewhere safe  but then youll just start again i promise i wont  youve been in that skinsuit too long youve forgotten there used to be a real margaret blaine  you killed her and stripped her and used the skin youre pleading for mercy out of a dead womans lips  perhaps i have got used to it a human life an ordinary life  thats all im asking  give me a chance doctor  i can change i dont believe you  so what do you want to do now dont mind  we could ask about hotels  what would trisha delaney say  suppose theres a bar down there with a spanish name or something   you dont even like trisha delaney  what the hell do you know  i know you and i know her and i know thats never gonna happen so who do you think youre kidding   at least i know where she is  there we are then  its got nothing to do with trisha this is all about me you left me  we were nice we were happy then you give me a kiss and run off with him  and you make me feel like nothing rose i was nothing  i cant even go out with a stupid girl from a shop because you pick up the phone and i comes running  i mean is that what i am rose  standby  am i just supposed to sit here for the rest of my life waiting for you because i will im sorry  i promise you ive changed since we last met doctor  there was this girl just today  a young thing  and something of a danger she was getting too close  i felt the blood lust rising just as the family taught me i was going to kill her without a thought then    i stopped  shes alive somewhere right now shes walking round this city because i can change i did change  i know i cant prove it i believe you  then you know im capable of better  it doesnt mean anything  i spared her life  you let one of them go but thats nothing new  every now and then a little victims spared because she smiled  cos hes got freckles cos they begged  and thats how you live with yourself thats how you slaughter millions  because once in a while on a whim if the winds in the right direction you happen to be kind  only a killer would know that  is that right from what ive seen your funny little happygolucky life leaves devastation in its wake  always moving on cos you dare not go back  playing with so many peoples lives you might as well be a god  and youre right doctor  youre absolutely right  sometimes  you let one go  let me go  im not asking you to leave him cos i know thats not fair  but i just need something some sort of promise that when you do come back youre coming back for me  rumbling is that thunder does it matter  thats not thunder  in the family slitheen we had no choice i was made to carry out my first kill at 13  if id refused my father would have fed me to the venom grubs  if im a killer its because i was born to kill its all i know  rumbling doctor are you even listening to me  can you hear that im begging for my life listen shush  ah go on then run its him again isnt it  its the doctor  its always the doctor its always gonna be the doctor its never me  my handcuffs  dont think youre running away oh im sticking with you  some date this turned out to be  its the rift the rifts opening  what the hell are you doing it just went crazy  its the rift time and space are ripping apart the whole citys gonna disappear  its the extrapolator ive disconnected it but its still feeding off the engine  its using the tardis never mind cardiff its gonna rip open the planet  what is it  whats happening  oh just little me  one wrong move and she snaps like a promise i might have known  ive had you bleating all night poor baby now shut it you  fly boy put the extrapolator at my feet  thank you  just as i planned i thought you needed to blow up the nuclear power station  failing that if i were to be  arrested  then anyone capable of tracking me down would have considerable technology of their own therefore    they would be captivated by the extrapolator  especially a magpie mind like yours doctor  so the extrapolator was programmed to go to plan b   to lock on to the nearest alien power source and open the rift  and what a power source it found    im back on schedule    thanks to you  the rifts gonna convulse youll destroy the planet and you with it  while i ride this board over the crest of the inferno all the way to freedom  stand back boys  surfs up  of course opening the rift means youll pull this ship apart  so sue me  its not just any old power source  its the tardis my tardis the best ship in the universe  itll make wonderful scrap  whats that light  the heart of the tardis  this ships alive youve opened its soul  its     so bright    look at it margaret  beautiful    look inside blon fel fotch  look at the light  thank you  dont look stay there close your eyes  jack shut it all down rose that panel over there turn all the switches to the right  nicely done thank you all what happened to margaret  mustve got burnt up carried out her own death sentence i dont think shes dead  then whered she go she looked into the heart of the tardis even i dont know how strong that is  and the ships telepathic it gets inside your head translates alien languages  maybe the raw energy can translate all sorts of thoughts  here she is  shes an egg regressed to her childhood shes an egg  she can start again if we take her home give her to a different family who bring her up properly  she might be all right or she might be worse thats her choice shes an egg shes an egg  oh my god mickey  opening the rift filled us up with energy we can go if thats all right yeah fine  hows mickey hes ok hes gone  do you wanna go and find him well wait no need he deserves better  off we go then always moving on  next stop raxacoricofallapatorious  now you dont often get to say that  well pop her in the hatchery margaret the slitheen can live her life again a second chance  thatd be nice  you got chosen youre a housemate youre in the house  welcome to the weakest link  were giving you a brandnew image whats wrong with what im wearing  what was that shes been evicted  this isnt just a game i need to find the doctor  theres something else going on we have contestants outside the games  they fear the doctor tell me who are they   thats impossible i know those ships they were destroyed  obviously they survived alert alert we are detected
