glory sir  ill tell them that planetfall is coming  he is behaving exactly as predicted sir  none of the humans can guess our true purpose  but  wheres the tardis taste that  in the air yecch  that sort of metal tang  teleport exchange  its the sontarans theyve taken it  im stuck  on earth like  like an ordinary person like a human how rubbish is that  sorry no offence but come on  so what do we

time i revealed what our work has been for  change of plan good to have you fighting alongside us doctor  im not im notfighting as in not hyphen fighting got it  now does anyone know what this gas is yet were working on it  its harmful but not lethal until it reaches 80 density  were having the first reports of deaths from tokyo city  and who are you  captain marion price sir oh put your hand down dont salute  jodrell banks traced a signal coming from 5000 miles above earth  were guessing thats what triggered the cars the sontaran ship  nato has gone to defcon one were preparing a strike  nuclear missiles wont even scratch the surface let me talk to the sontarans  youre not authorised to speak on behalf of the earth oh i earned that a long time ago  calling the sontaran command ship under jurisdiction two  of the intergalactic rules of engagement this is the doctor  doctor im here can you hear me  doctor breathing your last  my god theyre like trolls  yeah loving the diplomacy thanks  so tell me general staal  since when did you lot become cowards how dare you  oh thats diplomacy  doctor you impugn my honour  yeah im really glad you didnt say belittle cos then id have a field day but poison gas  thats the weapon of a coward and you know it  staal you could blast this planet out of the sky  and yet youre sitting up above watching it die  wheres the fight in that wheres the honour  or are you lot planning something else  cos this isnt normal sontaran warfare what are you lot up to  a general would be unwise to reveal his strategy to the opposing forces  ahhh the wars not going so well then losing are we  such a suggestion is impossible  what war the war between the sontarans and the rutans  its been raging far out in the stars for 50000 years  and for what  for victory sontarha  sontarha sontarha sontarha  give me a break  doctor i would seriously recommend that this dialogue is handled by official earth representation  finished you will not be so quick to ridicule when you see our prize  behold  we are the first sontarans in history to capture a tardis  well as prizes go thats  noble as they say in latin donna nobis pacem  thats me im here but did you never wonder about its design  its a phone box it contains a phone a telephonic device for communication  its sort of symbolic  like if only we could communicate you and i  all you have communicated is your distress doctor  oh my god  big mistake though showing it to me  but who do i phone  cos ive got a remote control  cease transmission  doctor what number are you on  you havent even got a number  remove the box from the war room beyond the transmission field  well that achieved nothing oh youd be surprised  but what do i do  all this stuff weve been building  all this invention wheres it been heading  gravity densifiers hydroponics atmospheric conversion ecoshells  more than enough to build a brand new world  luke we havent got time for this ive got to find my parents  oh but this isnt just theory  im talking planetfall for all of us  a brand new start for a brand new human race look  a new world far out beyond alpha geminorum just waiting for us  its official designation is castor  i did wonder about rattigans world  but we can take a vote on that what the hell are you on about  this is where were going  i have partners willing to take us there  oh hes lost it i havent got time for this  where are you going to find my brother  i didnt say you could leave i told him to put atmos in his car  ive got to go and help him stay where you are  what

there thosecattle  this is our chance to leave them behind you mean you want them dead  and i chose you to survive  with planetfall we can start again  we can build and breed we can prosper we can do anything  were going to breed  ive designed a mating programme ive planned the whole thing  well then shoot me  stay where you are  stay where you are i said  stay where you are thats an order  castor 36  youre just sick  guess that just proves it  im cleverer than you  im cleverer than everyone dyou hear me im clever  the united nations has issued a directive worldwide  telling urban populations to stay indoors  those in rural areas are being ordered  to stay away from all major cities  there are reports from every country in europe  of thousands of people walking across country to escape  and on the eastern seaboard of america its said to be reminiscent  of dunkirk with boats taking refugees out into the atlantic  with the freeways blocked by atmos cars populations of major cities  are now walking across open country to escape the fumes  it is being likened to a biblical plague  some are calling this the end of days  mum you all right  donna where are you sweetheart is that her  oh

but 10 unidentified  some sort of artificial heavy element  ever seen anything like it must be invented by the sontarans  this isnt just poison they need it for something else but what  launch grid online and active defcon one initiatives in progress  what i told you not to launch  the gas is at 60 density  weve got no choice  launching in 60     worldwide nuclear grid now coordinating   the planet is going nuclear  i admire them the bravery of idiots is bravery nonetheless  the operative is in place sir  commander skorr is the attack squad ready  ready and eager for battle sir  itll be good to taste blood  youre making a mistake colonel for once i hope the sontarans are ahead of you  north america online  united kingdom online  france online india online  pakistan online  china online north korea online  all systems locked and coordinated  launching in 10     god save us 4 3 2 1   what is it what happened  did we launch well did we  negative sir  the launch codes have been wiped sir must be the sontarans can we override it  trying it now sir missiles wouldnt even dent that ship  so why are the sontarans so keen to stop you  any ideas  how should i know  now protect the operative  stinking out there  sssh keep it down lads  enemy within at arms greyhound 40 declaring absolute emergency  sontarans within factory grounds east corridor grid six  absolute emergency declaring code red  all troops code red get them out of there  all troops open fire  the guns arent working inform all troops standard weapons do not work  tell the doctor its that cordolaine signal  hes the only one who can stop them  greyhound 40 report over  greyhound 40 report  greyhound 40 report  he wasnt greyhound 40 his name was ross  now listen to me and get them out of there  trap one to all stations  retreat  order imperative immediate retreat retreat retreat  reporting for duty sir  this is too easy theyre running like slimebait from a speelfox  this isnt war this is sport  theyve taken the factory why they dont need it why attack now what are they up to  times like this i could do with the brigadier  no offence none taken  sir alistairs a fine man if not the best unfortunately hes stranded in peru  launch grid back online  theyre inside the system sir its coming from within unit itself  trace it find out where its coming from and quickly gas levels  and rising  commander skorr reports victory with many glorious deaths  im sorry to report sir  ive failed  they wouldnt come  the students they didnt have the imagination to believe  a pity  weve lost our target practice  what do you mean upon arrival on board this ship your students  perhaps they were more clever than you thought  you promised there was no planetfall  castor 36 indeed  we only needed you for installation of the atmos system  no but im on your side  i did everything you wanted  and its not atmossystem thats a tautology  its just atmos execute him  a cowards retreat  now close all teleport links to earth  isolate them as they perish  why are they defending the factory only after were inside  because they wanted unit here  you gave them something they needed something now hidden inside the factory  something precious weve got to recover it  how does this cordolaine signal work its the bullets causes expansion of the copper shell  im on it for the billionth time you cant fight sontarans  phone have you got a phone i need your mobile quickly hurry up  whats happened where are you earth but dont worry ive got my secret weapon  and whats that you  somehow thats not making me happy  cant you just zap us down to earth with that remote  i havent got a remote though i should i need you there  thats why i made them move the tardis im sorry but youve got to go outside  theres sonterruns out there  sontarans theyll be on battle stations right now  i can talk you through it  but what if they find me  i know but there is nothing else i can do  the whole planet is choking donna  what do you need me to do  the sontarans have got a teleport link with the ship  theyll have deadlocked it i need you to reopen it  i cant even mend a fuse stop talking about yourself like that you can do this i promise  theres a sonterrun sontaran  did he see you no hes got his back to me  on the back of his neck theres a sort of plug like a hole  the probic vent one blow to the probic vent knocks em out  but hes gonna kill me im sorry  im so sorry but youve got to try  back of the neck  now find the external junction feed to the teleport  whats it look like circular panel on the wall  big symbol on the front like a letter t with a horizontal line through it or two fs back to back  well theres a door  should be a switch by the side there is  its sontaranshaped you need three fingers  youve got three fingers  oh yeah  im through oh you are brilliant you are  shut up  right  t with a line through it  got to go keep the line open counterattack  i said you dont stand a chance positions that means everyone  youre not going without me wouldnt dream of it  latest firing stock what do you think doctor are you my mummy  if you could concentrate  bullets with a radsteel coating no copper surface  should overcome the cordolaine signal  but the sontarans have lasers  you cant even see in this fog nightvision doesnt work  thank you for your lack of faith  but this time im not listening  attention all troops  the sontarans might think of us as primitive  as does every passing species with an axe to grind  they make a mockery of our weapons our soldiers our ideals  but no more from this point on it stops  from this point on the people of earth fight back and we show them  we show the warriors of sontar what the human race can do  trap one to hawk major go go go  its working the areas clearing  engines to maximum  its the valiant  unit carrier ship valiant reporting for duty doctor  with engines strong enough to clear away the fog  thats brilliant getting a taste for it doctor  no not at all not me  valiant fire at will  east and north secure doctor  donna hold on im coming  shouldnt we follow the colonel  nah you and me martha jones just like old times  alien

a triple agent when did you know right from the start  reduced iris contraction thinning of the hair on the left temple  and frankly you smell  you might as well have worn a tshirt saying clone  although maybe not in front of captain jack  you remember him dont you cos youve got all her memories  thats why the sontarans had to protect her  to keep you inside unit  martha jones is keeping you alive  its all right its all right im here im here ive got you  there was this thing doctor this alien with this head  blimey im busy got it  yes now hurry up take off the covering  all the blue switches inside flick them up like a fusebox  and that should get the teleport working  oh my god  thats me  you will face me sir  wonderful  dont touch me  its not my fault  the sontarans created you but you had all my memories  youve got a brother sister mother and father  if you dont help me theyre going to die  you love them  yes remember that  the gas tell us about the gas  hes the enemy then tell me  caesofine concentrate  its one part bosteen  two parts probic 5 clonefeed  its clonefeed  whats clonefeed like amniotic fluid for sontarans  theyre converting the atmosphere  changing the planet into a clone world earth becomes a hatchery  the sontarans are clones its how they reproduce  give em a planet this big theyll create billions of new soldiers  that gas isnt poison its food  my heart its getting slower  theres nothing i can do  in your mind youve got so many plans  theres so much that you want to do  and i will never do tomorrow what you can do today my mum says  cos cos you

what i did the sontarans lied to me  if i see one more gun  you know that coat sort of works  feel like a kid in my dads clothes  if youre calling him dad youre getting over him  a human female on board ship  it could only be the doctors work and all the teleport systems have been deadlocked open  no matter increase the atmos devices to maximum  choke them  behold the cloneworld is born  oh my little girl  come on well be all right  well be all right donna said so  she promised  come on darling its all right  thats why the sontarans stopped the missiles to hold back  caesofine gas is volatile so they used you to stop the nuclear attack  groundtoair engagement couldve sparked it off  what set fire to the atmosphere yeah they need the gas to breed their army  and all the time we had luke here planning a little trip were we  they promised me a new world and you built equipment  ready to terraform el mondo luko  so that humans could live there and breathe the air with this  an

option  you can go just leave  sontaran high command need never know what happened  your stratagem would be wise if sontarans feared death but we do not  at arms  if it saves the earth ill do it  a
