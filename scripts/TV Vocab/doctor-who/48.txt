who turned out the lights  you hear that those words that is the very last thought  of the man who wore that suit before you climbed inside it and stripped his flesh  thats a mans soul trapped inside a neural relay going round and round forever  now if you dont have the decency to let him go how about this  use him talk to me  its easy neural relay just point and think  use him talk to me hey who turned out the lights  the vashta nerada live on all the worlds in this system but you hunt in forests  what are you doing in a library we should go doctor in a minute  you came to a library to hunt why just tell me why  wedid not  oh hello  we did not  take it easy youll get the hang of it did not what  wedid notcomehere  well of course you did of course you came here  we come from here  from here  we hatched here  but you hatch from trees from spores in trees  these are our forests  youre nowhere near a forest look around you  these are our forests  youre not in a forest youre in a library  there are no trees in a  library we should go doctor  books  you came in the books  microspores in a million million books we should go doctor  oh look at that  the forests of the vashta nerada  pulped and printed and bound  a million million books hatching shadows  we should go doctor  oh  dave oh dave im so sorry  hey who turned out the lights we should go doctor  im stupid i talk too much this gob doesnt stop for anything  want to know the only reason im still alive always stay near the door  i suggested we meet here because a playground is the easiest place to see it to see the lie  what lie the children look at the children  why do you wear that veil  if i had a face like yours i wouldnt hide it  you remember my face then  the memories are all still there  the library the doctor me  youve just been programmed not to look  sorry butyoure dead  in a way were all dead here donna  we are the dead of the library  well what about the children  the children arent dead my children arent dead  your children were never alive  dont you say that dont you dare say that about my children  look at your children  look at all of them really look theyre not real  do you see it now theyre all the same  all the children of this world the same boy and the same girl over and over again  stop it  just stop it why are you doing this why are you wearing that veil  you knowits funny i keep wishing the doctor was here  the doctor is here isnt he  hes coming back right  you know when you see a photograph of someone you know but its from years before you knew them  its like theyre not quitefinished theyre not done yet  wellyes the doctors here  he came when i called just like he always does  but not my doctor  now my doctor  ive seen whole armies turn and run away  and hed just swagger off back to his tardis  and open the doors with a snap of his fingers  the doctorin the tardis  next stop  everywhere spoilers  nobody can open a tardis by snapping their fingers  it doesnt work like that it does for the doctor  i am the doctor  yeah some day  how are you doing wheres other dave  not coming sorry  well if theyve taken him why havent they gotten me yet i dont know  maybe tinting your visors making a difference  its making a difference all right  noones ever going to see my face again  can i get you anything an old age would be nice  anything you can do  im all over it doctor  when we first met you  you didnt trust professor song  and then she whispered a word in your ear and you did  my life so far  i could do with a word like that  what did she say  give a dead girl a break your secrets are safe with me  safe  what  safe you dont say saved nobody says saved you say safe the data fragment what did it say  4022 people saved no survivors doctor  nobody says saved nutters say saved you say safe  but you see it didnt mean safe it meantit literally meantsaved  what happened to your face  transcription errors  it destroyed my face did wonders for my intellect  im a very poor copy of myself  where are we  why are the children all the same  the same pattern over and over it saves an awful lot of space  space  cyberspace  no dont tell you mustnt tell  see there it is right there a hundred years ago massive power surge  all the teleports going at once soon as the vashta nerada hit their hatching cycle they attack  someone hits the alarm the computer tries to teleport everyone out it tried to teleport 4022 people  it succeeded pulled em all out but nowhere to send them nowhere safe in the library  vashta nerada growing all beamed up and nowhere to go  theyre stuck in the system waiting to be sent like emails  so whats a computer to do  what does a computer always do  it saved them  the library a whole world of books and right at the core the biggest hard drive in history  the index to everything ever written backup copies of every single book  the computer saved 4022 people the only way a computer can  it saved them to the hard drive  your physical self is stored in the library as an energy signature  it can be actualised again whenever you or the library requires  the library  if my face ends up on one of those statues you remember the statues  wait no justhang on  sothis isnt the real me  this isnt my real body  but ive been dieting  what you see around you this entire world  is nothing more than virtual reality  so why do you look like that  i had no choice  you teleported youre a perfect reproduction  i was just a data ghost caught in the wifi and automatically uploaded  and it made you clever were only strings of numbers in here  i think a decimal point may have shifted in my iq  but my face has been the bigger advantage  i have the two qualities you require to see absolute truth  i am brilliantand unloved  if this is all a dream  whose dream is it  its hard to see everything in the data core even for me but there is a word  just one word  cal  mummy my knee  oh look at that knee  oh look at that silly old knee  shes not real theyre fictions  im sorry but now that you understand that you wont be able to keep a hold  they are sustained only by your belief  you dont know you dont have children neither

little girl  the girl we saw in the computer  shes not in the computer  in a way she is the computer  the main command node  this is cal  cal is a child  a child hooked up to a mainframe why didnt you tell me this i needed to know this  because shes family  cal  charlotte abigail lux  my grandfathers youngest daughter  she was dying so he built her a library and put her living mind inside  with a moon to watch over her  and all of human history to pass the time any era to live in any book to read  she loved books more than anything  he gave her them all  he asked only that she be left in peace a secret  not a freak show  so you werent protecting a patent you were protecting her  this is only half a life of course  but its for ever  and then the shadows came  shadows i have to  i have to save  have to save  and she saved them  she saved everyone in the library  folded them into her dreams and kept them safe  then why didnt she tell us because shes forgotten  shes got over 4000 living minds chatting away inside her head it must be like  beingwell me  so what do we do easy autodestruct in ten minutes  we beam all the people out of the data core the computer will reset and stop the countdown  difficult charlotte doesnt have enough memory space left to make the transfer easy  ill hook myself up to the computer and she can borrow my memory space itll kill you stone dead  yeah its easy to criticise itll burn out both your hearts  ill try my hardest not to die its my main thing doctor  you and luxyboy back up to the main library prime any data cells you can find for maximum

their forests ill seal charlotte inside her little world take everybody else away  the shadows can swarm to their hearts content  so you think theyre just gonna let us go best offer theyre gonna get youre gonna make em an offer  theyd better take it cos right now im finding it very hard to make any kind of offer at all  i really liked anita  she was brave even when she was crying and she never gave in and you ate her  but im gonna let that pass  just as long as you let them pass  how long have you known i counted the shadows  you only have one now  shes nearly gone be kind  these are our forests  we are not kind  im giving you back your forests but you are giving me them  you are letting them go  these are our forests they are our meat  dont play games with me  you just killed someone i like that is not a safe place to stand  look me up  you have one day  anita im sorry shes been dead a while now i told you to go  lux can manage without me  but you cant  autodestruct in two minutes  oh no no no no come on what are you doing thats my job  oh and im not allowed to have a career i suppose  why am i handcuffed why do you even have handcuffs spoilers  stop this now this is gonna kill you id have a chance you dont have any  you wouldnt have a chance and neither do i  im timing it for the end of the countdown therell be a blip in the command flow  that way it should improve our chances of a clean download river please no  funny thing is this means youve always known how i was going to die  all the time weve been together you knew i was coming here  the last time i saw you the real you the future you i mean  you turned up on my doorstep  with a new haircut and a suit  you took me to darillium to see the singing towers  what a night that was  the towers sang  and you cried  you wouldnt tell me why but i suppose you knew it was time  my time time to come to the library  you even gave me your screwdriver  that shouldve been a clue  theres nothing you can do  you can let me do this if you die here itll mean ive never met you  time can be rewritten not those times not one line dont you dare  its ok  its ok its not over for you youll see me again  youve got all of that to come  you and me time and space  you watch us run  river you know my name autodestruct in  you whispered my name in my ear nine eight seven  theres only one reason i would ever tell anyone my name  theres only one time i could  shh now  spoilers three two one  donna  whats happening  i dont know but its not real nothing heres real  the whole world everything none of its real  am i real

did it  youre all back look at you  hahahaha  look at that  look at that he did it   saved  please be patient only three can teleport at a time  do not state your intended destination until you arrive in  any luck  there wasnt even anyone called lee in the library that day  suppose he could have had a different name out here but lets be honest  he wasnt real was he  maybe not  i made up the perfect man  gorgeous adores me and hardly able to speak a word  what does that say about me  everything sorry did i say everything i meant to say nothing  i was aiming for nothing i accidentally said everything  stand right in the middle of the teleport please  what about you  are you all right im always all right  is all right special time lord code for  really not all right at all why  cos im all right too  come on  your friend  professor song  she knew you in the future but she didnt know me  what happens to me  because when she heard my name the way she looked at me donna  this is her diary  my future  i could look you up  what do you think  shall we peek at the end  spoilers right  right  come on  the next chapters this way  when you run with the doctor it feels like it will never end  but however hard you try you cant run for ever  everybody knows that everybody dies and nobody knows it like the doctor  but i do think that all the skies of all the worlds might just turn dark if he ever  for one moment accepts it  why why would i give her my screwdriver why would i do that  thing is future me had years to think about it to think of a way to save her  and what he did was give her a screwdriver why would i do that  oh oh oh look at that  im very good  what have you done saved her  stay with me  you can do it stay with me come on you and me one last run  sorry river shortcut  everybody knows that everybody dies  but not every day  not today  its ok youre safe  youll always be safe here  the doctor fixed the data core this is a good place now but i was worried you might be lonely  so i brought you some friends  arent i a clever girl  arent we all  oh for heavens sake  he just cant do it can he  that man that impossible man  he just cant give in  some days are special  some days are so so blessed  some days nobody dies at all  now and then every once in a very long while  every day in a million days  when the wind stands fair and the doctor comes to call  everybody lives  sweet dreams everyone  you be careful  taking a big space truck with a bunch of strangers across a diamond planet called midnight  what could possibly go wrong  enjoy your trip oh i cant wait  what the hell is making that noise  its trying the door there is no it  just tell me what the hell it is down  if were gonna get out of this then you need me  like youre so special  two people are dead dont make it a third  its coming for me its coming for me oh  aaaargh get out of there
