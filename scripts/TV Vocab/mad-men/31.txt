know what you did to freddy ramson   i refuse to fell bad we are going to get raises  don it is very necessary   it is  because he loves this room and hearing his own voice and saving the day  duck would you excuse us for a moment    season 3 episode 5 the fog  i was expecting the piersons as well but theyre not coming  please  my goodness  of course here take mine  i appreciate that both of you are here  what happened  the children were at the water fountain during gym  and sally told becky pierson she should save some for the fish  becky ignored her  sally hit the back of her head and her face went into the spigot  and then becky went after her  hair pulling scratching  she didnt need stitches in the end i understand  this girl this becky pierson   sally told me shes a bruiser  shes heavy  the children poke pencils into her sides  when shes sitting because they think she cant feel it   sally doesnt do that does she  no  but  this bad behavior is new  i know that youre expecting a child but she already has a little brother  i guess what im asking is has anything changed at home recently  my  my father passed away  last week  the week before two weeks now  i feel terrible for bringing that up for you  well it it has not been easy  is this grandpa gene were talking about  oh that poor thing  sally didnt mention it  why didnt you call us or send a note  i dont think she missed a day  did she go to the funeral  why would we put her through that  i dont think children belong in graveyards  no of course not  now i realize why she was asking all those questions  about medgar evers murder  she was  im im sorry  i have to use the ladiesroom again   we can talk about this another time  no im not as upset as i look  i i cant help this  i am mortified   its not a good time  no and  it really should be shouldnt it  sally does need more attention  shes grieving  there is a very special pain  to losing someone at that age  i dont know if you can understand that  i can  mrs draper i was just talking to your husband  and this really can wait  are you sure  because i just want to put it behind us  i just really want everything to be okay when the baby comes  its going to be a beautiful summer      tap the restaurant  112 tipped  38  dinner 1944  its better to have a bit of don draper than no don draper at all  id like that in writing  it seems strange that the two of you went  on the same overnight trip and you put in for 70  and he put in for 82  if i were lying wouldnt i have made it a round number  not that dons lying  i signed his receipts didnt i  which brings us to the undocumented portion of my assessment  the amount of pencils pens  pads paper and postage  that are currently being consumed suit a company four times our size  it has also been brought to my attention that a credenza  has disappeared  a theft that i believe necessitates a conspiracy  people forget that karl marx was the greatest economist who ever lived  and whatever you think of his solution  the problem he posed was about the catastrophic up  and down of the marketplace  tell the folks at admiral that karl marx says everythings okay  boom and bust bull and bear i need a tv i have a tv  damn it someone helped ken cherrypick all of burts successful accounts  and ive been left with the dogs   admiral is not a dog  sales are flat  its all over their memos  and now i have to look them in the eye with nothing  except maybe new creative  stop it  now youre interested  there are some areas of growth and i me literally areas  atlanta oakland  chicago detroit  newark d c  great jazz cities  and i left out st louis and kansas city also growing   what does that mean  great jazz musicians  seriously is it possible that these admirals are being bought by negroes  lois caught her scarf putting paper in the xerox  maybe when joan leaves i can finally get rid of her  can you pretend like youre back in the media department  and tell me what this says to you  look at the cities  is it possible that negroes are outbuying other people 21  you could jump to that conclusion i suppose  did you hear about lois   youve got a winner there kinsey  did you see it  i did  so whats everybody doing tonight baby married  do you want to go to the mets game tickets and a watch  why thank you birds eye  does the watch say birds eye on it  no it says hamilton electric  what time is it what time isnt it  admiral is happy were happy  theyre not happy  morris comma  in reference to retooling the factory for london fog childrens  and young adults  i thought id bring you the minutes of the meeting since you had to run off  youre wasting paper  id have to make 1000 to keep up with your department  they waste paper because they throw out bad ideas  they waste paper because they use it to sop up spilled drinks  right after their midafternoon naps  you came here because we do this better than you nd part of that  is letting our creatives be unproductive until they are  pennies make pounds and pounds make profits  i dont want to talk to you this way  ive tried it before and it never works  im not usually this emotional  you want to make money  start getting your nails dirty with bert cooper and harry crane  clients love to pay for media and creative needs pencils  i suppose i hadnt necessarily thought of it that way  and lay off of expense accounts  think of the mens moral not just your own  youve obviously seen bridge on the river kwai  ive seen everything you have my ticket stubs  your uncle herman is on the line he wont leave a message  uncle herman

people walking around the halls all the time  laughing their heads off  were going to have lunch you know  i dont know duck it doesnt sound like a good idea  campbell this is beyond no hard feelings  i wont waste your time havent i always been on your side   when  ill have my girl call your girl  ill say its clorox   hello  anyone home  ill get it   mr draper  yes  this is suzanne farrell  sallys teacher  im not interrupting dinner am i  i just felt i should call and apologize about our meeting this morning  why  what i mean is  my father died when i was eight  and i might have overdone it  relating to sally in that way  i didnt mean to upset your wife  i guess i can get a little caught up in things  and lose perspective  i dont know why im calling im embarrassing myself  no youre fine

woke up one day and had a realization  you two have a secret relationship   what thats ridiculous  come on  the way you handled that freddy rumsen thing so that she could move up  ive been doing this a long time i know what i saw   thats not what happened  you can be modest if you want to  but that kind of focused ambition is rare in advertising  thank you  i want to take you both with me to the promised land  at grey an account man is expected to have ideas  and creatives are expected to be geniuses  youll be sitting on velvet pillows showered with riches awards  were not going anywhere well she can  do we have to go together  pete i know you have ideas and youre a risktaker  sterling cooper is never going to reward that  well thank you   anything else  dont be a baby  you should be taking meetings like this twice a week  if you want to woo me youll have to buy me my own lunch   maybe i should leave too  why would you do that  youre so talented you should strike while they irons hot   what does that mean  it means the skys the limit  no mortgage no family  youre a freegoing career gal with great ideas  am i wrong  i dont know  this is your time peggy  let me ask you something hollis  what type of tv do you have   an rca  really  color   why did you get it  to watch tv  but why an rca specifically  i didnt see any difference i guess   good afternoon  a lot of negroes prefer admiral  ive done research  i have an rca  so do your friends buy admirals  im sorry sir i cant really say  look  this is important and id really like to have an honest conversation with you  i dont want to get into trouble  its just us   its just hollis and  mr campbell  do you think im a bigot  i just want to know why you bought your tv   i dont know i dont remember  its your tv   its a big purchase  i dont even watch the damn thing   really why not  why should i  weve got bigger problems to worry about than tv okay  youre thinking about this in a very narrow way  the idea is that everyone is going to have a house a car  a television the american dream  its my job  every job has its ups and downs  you dont watch baseball i dont believe you  what are you doing out of bed  i smelled something   what are you making  a snack  do you want some  i didnt know you could cook  mommys much better at it   are you looking for a chick  i am  miss farrell told us about that when we went to the farm  but she says that those eggs can never become a chicken  even though they come out of a chicken   whys that  because theyre from the store  and you know what else  if you hold an egg up and it has veins in it  you can shake it then eat it  really  its called addling  is the baby gonna live in grandpa genes room  its not grandpa genes room its the babys room  i thought it was gonna be a girl  well i thought you were gonna be a boy  not all surprises are bad   everythings gonna be fine  thats what miss farrell said  well then i guess it must be true  burt petersons firing was undignified  building security thats all ill say  confirm a couple of rumors  did he throw a desk chair against a window  only to have it bounce back and knock him over  not that i know of  did he make a 2 in a file cabinet  burt peterson lived hard and loved hard  harry here is an expert in media  television the air not the sets  now admiral television sales are flat  we know that  but as we studied your indices  we realized that theyre not flat everywhere  in fact  among negroes sales are actually growing   we know that too  you do  no of course you do  these are your numbers but i think weve discovered  an interesting strategy  this is ebony  by negroes for negroes  jet  space in these magazines costs far less than  what you currently spend  daily newspapers that go just to this market for pennies on the dollar  and  shift a portion of the media budget from lowerindexing white areas  to this market where it can do more good  they already like it we can make them buy more by increasing the exposure  a 5 sales bump in detroit alone  would make you the same profit as a 2 increase systemwide  and ads on television geared to this market and white markets  will have double the effect  a negro ad and a white ad  so campbell youre making twice the ads for us now  no do them together  integrate it  i dont think thats legal  of course its legal  look this conversation is not worth having  whos to say that negroes arent buying admiral televisions  because they think white people want them  miss olson is here to see you  send her in  oh sorry  i know he doesnt need clothes but dont return it  im the youngest i never had anything new   you didnt have to do that  i did  no one told me they were all going in on it together  i heard you were back at work but now i wonder if thats true  i invited you in  i dont know if this is the best time  i dont know its kind of serious  ive been thinking about my situation here  and im so grateful to you for all youve done  i just  well you know  im paid very little  my secretary doesnt respect me  because i make 71 more a week than she does  maybe we need to get you a cheaper secretary  paul kinsey does the same work that i do  and not as well sometimes  and i dont know if you read it in the paper  but they passed a law where women who do the same work as men  will get paid the same thing  equal pay  its not a good time  its not a good time for me don   do you know how expensive the city is  its not gonna happen  peggy not now  im fighting for paperclips around here  third time  it must be old hat   youre gonna be fine peggy  i look at you and i think  i want what he has   really  you have everything  and so much of it  i suppose thats probably true  what do you want me to say  i dont think i could have been any clearer  you see whats been going on here the last six months  what if this is my time   where are you going  to the ladies room  you want to join me   did you tell don about duck  thats none of your business  sure they hear youre shopping around theyll want you more  but me im sharing my job with kenny  im already redundant  you have relationships with your clients thats leverage   did you say something  its my decision pete  if it isnt martin luther king i should drop kick you off the roof  admiral television has no interest in becoming  a colored television company  but they are  it seems illogical to me that they would reject an opportunity  to make more money   then again im in advertising  this is a sensitive issue   businesses hate that  let me put it in account terms  are you aware of the number of hand jobs im gonna have to give  am i being taken off the account  im going to have to pretend i had you killed  sales are flat i had to do something  i dont know if anyones ever told you that half the time  this business comes down to i dont like that guy  are we done with the flogging  its never as good as you think its gonna be  if i may burt roger  it does seem as though theres money to be made in the negro market  obviously not with admiral  but i dont think it would be wrong of us to pursue it  in some way  really  ive just moved here  im a stranger in a strange land  but i can tell you that theres definitely something going on  well look into it  you can go   were here  shes here  welcome welcome   mommy  careful  here let me take him  i missed you so much  wait till you see your fridge  if theres a power outage  you can feed the entire street for a month  hi baby im your brother bobby  remember you have to be careful  how was it  you know  was all a fog  youre making a mistake not forcing carla to stay  shes been away from her family   and i can manage  i know some girls   you want something to eat  sure  ive got it come on
