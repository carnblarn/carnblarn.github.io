me you busty jewist  maybe we should try and exploit the danger  instead of fighting it travel as adventure  or how bout this  average american family of three  standing on the shore suitcases in hand  the red sea parts before them  on the other side waits a gleaming four star resort  shouldnt you see the promise land  take religion out  theyve got plenty of stations of the cross traffic  ive skimmed this research  and the whole things pretty red  these communes kibitzes  its positively soviet  except the daughters of the american revolution  are shuttling this book up and down fifth avenue  its a good story they start in these prison camps  real prisoners then the next thing you know  theyre in the desert armed to the teeth  cutting their way through the enemy dying for the cause  and then they have a government  a commie government  made my mother cry  so we have a quasi communist state  where women have guns  and its filled with jews  well not completely filled  lets not forget that there are also arabs  theyve got oranges  as far as i can see  the biggest thing this place has going for it  the people are good looking  the jews there dont look like the jews here  have

you know the first boy i ever kissed was jewish  how did that happen  my friend deirdre shaw was friends with a jewish girl  beth goldsilver or something  beth invited us to a mixer at her synagogue in lower mareine  surprised your mother let you go  well it was a fundraiser for charity  those poor skinny people in the boats  this boy danced with me all evening  david rosenberg  he was very good looking  but there was something about him that was gloomy  was he a good kisser  lets just say he had more practice than i did  yeah im sure he was very disappointed  please the only reason he picked me  is because i wasnt part of the synagogue  in fact the next day on the school bus  beth told everyone i was necking with david rosenberg  the looks they gave me  they were all blondes by the next summer  honey its hot  and i have to read this book about the desert  of course  go ahead  we should get an air conditioner up here  yeah well see  hi fellas come on in  did you see this  someone broke into the yankees equipment locker  in cleveland yesterday swiped mickey mantles pet glove  they should of taken his bat  should i wait for you to have your breakfast  a day without orange juice is a hell of a long day  hey look man no hands  belle jolie  ive been looking at the work of our esteemed predecessors  im not heartened  they make more colors of lipstick than howard johnson has ice cream flavors  but their sales are in the crapper  these names  passion flower peach  tropical bourdois red  look ethel roserburg pink  wear it to the chair  did you know that lipstick was invented  to simulate the flush in a womans face  after you treated her right  if youre gonna quote the research report  dont start with did you know  research im stumped  ill be honest i dont speak moron  do either of you speak moron  lets throw it to the chickens  okay girls come on in  come on in ladies gather around  settle down  what no lunch  no dear  this is better belle jolie wants us to tell them what we think  about their new line of lipsticks  one way glass  doesnt it seem weird to you  it should be two way glass right  i dont care what they call it  beats the hell out of xray specs  its called brainstorming  that sounds intimidating  is it like a test  there are no wrong answers you just be your pretty little selves  grab a lipstick  grab a mirror and sit down  and remember the mirror could be your best friend or your worst enemy  has no taste  ugly dress  horrible wig  theyre brainstorming  i wouldnt expect more than a few sprinkles  i love it when they do that  my little blowfish  anybody mind if i take off my pants  red ones for me  how many lipsticks do you own  gee i dont know id have to go home and count  do you match your lipcolor to your clothing  or to your accessories  i know that seems like a loaded question  it is unloaded  and i insist you curb your editorial comments  sometimes i match it to my nail polish  good answer  go ahead  do you change your lipcolor with the seasons  you stand over there  at what point do we start running electricity through the chairs  we should of put a man in there so theyd take it seriously  good  i was afraid id missed it  i want to stand and salute that  whats with the mouse ears over there  thanks for coming   can i get you anything  no   how have you been  fine  fine tired  doesnt show  im in the middle of spring inventory  i hope youre not gonna tell me that the grand plan  for remaking  our store has a hitch in it  you look beautiful  i thought you had urgent business to discuss  anything for the lady  nothing for me coffee   irish coffee  coffee  business  turns out israel tourism  is considering becoming a client  and im having a hard time getting a handle on it  and im the only jew you know in new york city  youre my favorite  jesus don crack a book once in a while  i have  its all sentimental world war ii trivia oranges  kids in blue and white hats  theyre doing the movie of exodus with paul newman  paul newman thats nice  now i have two reasons to see it  damn it  youre usually so put together  ill say one thing about israelis  dont cross them  well those people at the meeting were definitely zionists  zion just means israel  its a very old name  im sorry im not an expert on this and something feels strange  about being treated like one  i just want to know something about it  that doesnt come from some administrative propaganda  well heres some more world war ii trivia  they just arrested adolf eichmann in argentina last week  have you seen his resume  okay i deserved that  but im talking about tourists going to israel  i dont know what i can say  im american im really not very jewish  if my mother hadnt died having me  i could have been marilyn instead of rachel  and no one would know the difference  what is the difference  look jews have lived in exile  for a long time  first in babylon then  all over the world shanghal brooklyn and  weve managed to make a go of it  maybe it has something to do with the fact  that we thrive at doing business with people who hate us  i dont hate you  no individuals are wonderful  thats not what i meant  i dont know  a country for those people  as you call us well  seems very important  why arent you there  my life is here  my grandfather came from russia now i have a store on fifth avenue  ill visit but i dont have to live there  just  has to be  for me its more of an idea than a place  utopia  maybe  they taught us at barnard about that word  utopia  the greeks had two meanings for it  utopos meaning the good place  and utopos  meaning the place that cannot be  i have to get back to the office  i better not see this on my bill  okay girls playtimes over  time to put down your lipsticks and head back to your desks

brainstorming  sorry i missed that  what was the line  a bucket of kisses  basket of kisses  bucket sounds better  if you like them wet and sloppy  point is while the rest of the hens were busy  pulling out each other feathers  that one saw the benefit not the feature   really  yeah  she said she didnt want to be  one of a hundred colors in a box  thats interesting isnt it  it is  it was like watching a dog play the piano  its me barbara can you talk  shes still sleeping thank god whats on your mind  i think i might of met somebody  youre not sure  thats good  he has some serious limitations  does he work in the store  no he doesnt work at the store  well he has a job doesnt he  yes  then whats the problem  would daddy like him  daddy would hate him  so hes not jewish  who cares what daddy thinks  hes not your boyfriend anymore  youre 28yearsold you work 60 hours a week  the last thing you want is to end up like aunt rosie  lying to your nieces about how many engagements you had  aunt rosie wasnt lying  please there was no max the communist  does he have all his hair  more than hell ever need  is he funny  sometimes after a couple  so hes a schecker daddy will hate him  i do feel this attraction  i want him and i want to ignore everything else about him  its 1960 we dont live in a shadow we can marry for love  im not sure people do that anymore  why do you always have to be so cynical  because sometimes  things come  good things but theres no future in them  youre a modern woman rach forget the wedding  believe me id do anything for some romance
