its been so amazing i sort of lost track  i seem to remember a woman  wasting a good piece of a beautiful afternoon  reciting this diatrave against television  that shouldve ended with her banging her shoe on the table  don darling if you wanna ask the question  just ask it  whered you get the tv  i got it  same place you got that wig  someone gave it to me  and you took it  have you seen this

of  that doctor patterson is not through  i swear when we walk down park avenue  i could hear the quacking  i know you said that  this doctor was nice  he was older actually  he was from rochester  has two children that are ten years apart  okay youve given me his credentials  what did he say  well he said i could go to newyork  and run the di tests  and i said that i already had  and that the results were negative  and he even called doctor patterson  so  they said there was nothing physically wrong with me  then i told him what happened  and he said that i should see a psychiatrist  doctors must love that they now have an answer  for i dont know whats wrong  he said it could be a nervous condition  nervous about what driving  so well go down to he grand union parking lot  well practice your 1000 and 200  he seemed very concerned if you wanna know  but thats their solution  why not open the hood and poke around  so  so i left  what else am i supposed to do  well go to a doctor another doctora good one  ill get a specialist from burt cooper  his names on a wall over at saint vincents  okay  and leave the dishes for the girl  seven  eight  nine  ten  eleven  twelve  ninetyeight  ninetynine  one hundred  you know i do worry about you burty  i know  when you brought it up i was shocked  although i realized that  thats what doctor patterson  was trying to say in his own way and  it doesnt have as much of a sigma today  i just dont know what they can possibly tell you  doyouthink i need a psychiatrist  i always thought people saw psychiatrists  when they were unhappy  but i look at you  and this  and them  and that  and i think are you unhappy  of course im happy  well thatll be 35 dollars youre welcome  whatever you think is best  good  act of god sorry  someone threw themselves in front of the train  ah suicide  okay boys  what do we have  gentlemen the aerosol can is nothing less than space age  its steel it has exhaust  its even shaped like a rocket  certainly an engineering marvel  right guard  it works in my suit or yours  well punch the yellow of the moon so it pops behind him  were looking for new worlds  and with that search comes any number of gadgets  its not just some random association  this thing is shiny  its explosive  its from the future a place so close to us now  filled with wonder and ease  except some people think of the future  and it upsets them  they see a rocket they start building a bomb shelter  what how do you get there  i dont think its ridiculous to assume  were looking for other planets  because this one will end  i thought we had something here  who is this moron flying around space  i mean he pees in his pants  brass tacks who buys this  some woman  your girl or your mother will pick this up  walking through the grocery store or the druggist  we should be asking ourselves what do women want  i dont know but i wish i had it  maybe a chesty alien girl  also wants to get into his suit  im not asking what do women want  in some bull crap research psychology way  im asking what would make a woman look  at this mans deodorant and say i want that  well ive stopped trying to figure out what they think  maybe i should stop paying you  well i always thought women liked the way we smell  that explains a lot  i feel like were close here  i mean this one  the cans rightside up but the guys upside down  no  lets bring it down to earth  you think they want a cowboy  hes quiet and strong  he always bring the cattle home safe  you watch tv  what if they want something else  inside some  mysterious wish that were ignoring  howd it go  ive still got my novel  im sorry  buy me lunch  samuel that drape man its sadder than a map  well its lightweight and it tells me im at work  but you sure can talk mr kensey  sixty cents  what are you doing  keep the change  you figure the place out yet  what do you mean  how it runs  i know the copywriters tell the art department what to do  and i know the account executives tell the copywriters what to do  what  no one tells the writers what to do  except for the head of creative your boss  its all on draper  dont think that just cause hes good looking  hes not a writer  dig  this is the media department  theyre where 90 of where the clients check goes  they buy space newspapers billboards television  and my favorite aging whore radio  thats the whole shakedown actually  all you really need to know  they dont sell ideas or campaigns or jingles  they sell media at a 15 markup  creative is just window dressing its thrown in for free  really  accounting they keep track of how much were spending  versus how much were taking in  and since were buying futures  if you ever ever see um  the man upstairs go in there  grab the lifeboats baby were going down  account management  where prep schoolers skip arminarm  wizard of oz style joined together  by their lack of skill and their love of mirrors  account executives are all good at something  although its never advertising  submitted for your approval  one peter campbell  a man who recently discovered  that the only place for his hand  is in your pocket  you watch it  have you seen it the twilight zone  i dont think so i dont like science fiction  im gonna pretend you didnt say that  mitch in media says cbs might pull the plug  ill kill myself  and here we have the creative department  the talent home sweet home  like the art department downstairs  they put us far enough away from the elevator  so we cant sneak out  you know there are women copywriters   good ones  sure  i mean you  you can always tell when a womans writing copy  but sometimes she just might be the right man for the job you know  you must be very creatively satisfied  lets not lose our heads  sterling coop is positively cromagnon  i have a friend im not even gonna say what agency  but all they do is smoke mary jane and play darts  and honestly i think theyre the best store on the street  you like ukrainian food  oxtail dumplings  we still have a lot of work to do  i think hes still in there  ah got it  thanks for lunch  sorry about your copy  thanks for reminding me  i can never get used to the fact that  most of the time it looks like youre doing nothing  fix you something   close enough  coop is gonna want a carbon  with your handpicked team for nixon on it  and i warn you right now it includes pete campbell  i should go to niagara falls for two weeks  it does wonders for your career  niagara falls  boy redefines lack of imagination  ahh thats where youve been  let me ask you something  what do women want  who cares  you mentioned the other night  that your daughter had been to a psychiatrist  im sure you must be mistaken about that  you know what  i am very comfortable with my mind  thoughts clean and unclean loving and  the opposite of that  but i am not a woman  and i think it behooves any man to toss  all female troubles into the hands of a stranger  we had one head shrinker in the army  a gossip  busting with other peoples thoughts  hasnt changed much just costs more  you cant shoot at them  we live in troubling times  we do  who could not be happy with all of this  jesus you know what they want  everything  especially if the other girls have it  trust me psychiatry is just this years candy pink stove  its just more happiness  people  are  funny  beauty and the beast  hey daddy  hey there cold lamb sound good  yeah  someone started on a train  in the office  because of a good day or a bad day  you know when i told you you had everything  i was wrong  oh my god  white gold  its got one of those tiny little faces that you have to be young to see  oh don its beautiful  the guy at the store set the time  but he was english so it might be six hours off  did you look at sallys face  i think she has a bruise  i didnt see it  on her cheek bone under her eye  i thought that was ketchup  what if she had gotten a scar something permanent  i dont wanna play what if  im just saying  if it had happened to bobby it wouldve been okay  because a boy with a scar is nothing  but a girl so much worse  nothing happened  i keep  thinking  not that i couldve killed the kids but  worse  sally couldve survived  and gone on living with this  horrible scar on her face and  some long lonely  miserable life  don  whats happening to me  do i need to see someone  i dont know  i guess so  whatever you want   brought betty into the city to see the doctor but uh  honestly i think im the one not feeling so great  i called in sick  dont bring that here  im serious don dont talk to me about her  that makes me feel cruel  youre right  sometimes  i cant decide if you have everything  or nothing  i live in the moment  nothing is everything  it sounds more like you live in the village  actually i live in the hall  i lost my key  i had to um  spend the night abroad  could you be a gentlemen  and break into the fire escape  so i dont have to  is draper in yet  hes not coming in today hes not feeling well  im leaving dont tell anyone i was here  no its peggy  hello  i dont think i can go out to lunch today  mr drapers not coming in  that means you can go out to lunch  have you never worked in an office before  he could call  its my second weekanother time  i did enjoy the tour the other day  it was eye opening  i didnt think your eyes could be any wider  thats clever  i guess ill go to the cart you want something  what  the office is gonna empty out any second  we could push the couch in front of the door  paul  do you belong to someone else  shit  i dont even like to sit in dons chair  i think weve misunderstood each other  there is someone else right  yes  i hope you know that covering your typewriters  office code for im done for the day  im not feeling so swell  neither am i look at these letters you typed after lunch  taraho indiana has two rs  and an a and an e at the end  i gather you missed homerow by a hand  or you were out drinking with the junior account boys again  i wasnt drinking  i dont like your tone  ill redo these right away  look at you all in a snip  are you gonna watch me  what is wrong with you  honestly  why is it that every time  a man takes you out to lunch around here youre  youre the desert  thats terrible  its constant from every corner  im from bay ridge  we have manners  why cant they just leave it alone  because men always bother you all the time  they follow you down the street  well not exactly  look dear i dont know you that well  but youre the new girl and youre not much  so you might as well enjoy it while it lasts  of course  dont be that way  im just offering some perspective thats all  thank you joan  ill save my thank yous  till you correct that correspondence  i dont know why im here  im i mean i do im  nervous i guess  anxious  i dont sleep that well  and my hands  well theyre fine now  its like when you have a problem with your car  and you go to the mechanic and its not doing it anymore  not that you are a mechanic  i guess a lot of people must come here worried about the bum  is that true  its a common nightmare people say  i read it in a magazine  my mother always told me  that it wasnt polite to talk about yourself  she passed away recently  i guess i already said that  can i smoke in here  were all so lucky to be here  its 730  i have to go to roys reading  i have to be there to acted surprised when jack kerouac doesnt show  lock the door when you leave  if youre gonna go home  take a shower you stink  its cause im the man  you seem to forget that sometimes  im lucky they arent all like you  i take that as a compliment  what do women want  well one of the things has to be  not being asked something like that  what do women want  you know better then to ask  give me a pen  jesus  what do women want  any excuse to get closer  thank god  theres that ego people pay to see  ill have the filet of sole  excellent  cream spinach or cream corn  spinach  fried potatoes or au gratin  au gratin with tomato juice to start  ill have the goulash  very good sir  vodka gimlet  old fashioned  how was your day  fine  you know i work with doctors  theyll say anything you pay them to  of course dear  but dinner in the city  im glad im hungry  i saw an interesting thing in the journal american  apparently the phone company wants to start  charging people for unlisted numbers  well that doesnt seem fair  some people agree with you  and theyre giving aliases to ma bell  they call it anomde phone  isnt that smart  of course most of them are pornographic  the best one  pat magroin  oh my god  id believe they would print that in the journal american  let alone in the phone book  this is nice  ill be right up  hello  sorry to bother you so late  its don
