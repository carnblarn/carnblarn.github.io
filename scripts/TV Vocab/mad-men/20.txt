thinking about her didnt you go see wayne  im going to eliminate your objections right away  first of all you can afford it  do you know how invigorating it is  to go in and write a check for 6500  and not care  secondly  not to get too deep before the cocktail hour  but uh do i need to remind you  of the finite nature of life  mr phillips  send him in  like the song says enjoy yourself its later than you think  martinson coffee  martinsons  they changed it  change it back  jim van dyke told the people at grey theyre under review  so grey must be scraling  its hard for them to do a lot of new work  they just redesigned labels displays and dropped the s  but they have some kids working on print and tv   are they better than our kids  well find out  youre welcome  i spent saturday birding with that man and by birding i mean sitting on a stump  with a pair of binoculars whispering  did you see anything unusual  a refrigerator floating in a pond  mr smith and mr smith are here

youre gonna knock em dead  look don its pretty clear why were here  you want to know how our generation feels  so i get this letter from my friend back in michigan  hes still in school man  and its got this i dont know  so dig it  we would replace power  rooted in possession privilege or circumstance  by power and uniqueness  rooted in love reflectiveness  reason and creativity  thats a beautiful sentiment  does your friend know what you do for a living  yeah there was a shitty note with it  but this whole concept is deep  students for a democratic society  thats a hell of a focus group  its how our generation feels  it is what it is  its idealistic  thats nice  your generation wants to talk about that newly designed can  and the premium beans  but we dont want to be told what we should do  or how we should act  we just want to be  you just want to be selling martinsons coffee  just listen to this  comme a  so the thought is  every maternity ward will get a visit from a registered nurse  with a doll and a crate of pampers  and she will extol their virtues which are many  what did draper say  he liked it  but he said the same thing he keeps saying  i cant get them to lower the price  do you know the years of rd pg put into this  besides theyre worth it no boiling no diaper service no plastic pants  and the greatest benefit of all you can throw them away  you should reuse them  mr draper went over these ideas  and had thoughts he would like you all to discuss  well its 500 are we going out  i dont know sweetheart maybe   ill take those papers  good night miss olsen  would you mind helping us clean the mess up  im meeting with cooper tomorrow  he said he wants to see me and only me  isnt that from west side story  you know hes going to ask you about the picture   what picture  some new painting  he calls people in to see what they think  no i think were going to discuss expanding the television department  i heard it cost 10000  how does everybody know about this are you making it up  last year harry went up to the roof looking for cosmonauts   has anyone seen it  dale  its abstract expressionist  what the hell does that mean  thank you all for ruing this  youre the one who walked to the opposite end of the office  to tell us you had a meeting  if youre lucky youll have a meeting  and im not going to tell you anything about the damn picture  why dont you just go look at it  im sorry jane  but you just dont walk into his office like that   but hes gone for the day  that doesnt matter  miss blankenship wont mind  im going to

cooper loves it and you have to love it  like in an emperors new clothes situation  or he thinks its a joke and youll look like a fool if you pretend to dig it  people like him pretend they understand this  maybe he has a brochure in here something that explains it  i dont think its supposed to be explained  im an artist okay  it must mean something  maybe it doesnt  maybe youre just supposed to experience it  because when you look at it  you do feel something right  its like looking into something very deep  you could fall in  thats true  did someone tell you that   how could someone tell you that  this is pointless lets go  im ready  harry actually took the stairs  we could have stolen it couldnt we  who are you  i was thinking i could write a great short story about this  you know

joe  they named it after him right  thats just ancient history now  there have been a million ways that the folks on this avenue  have tried to tell our generation what to do  except we dont want to be told what to do  thats over  we want to find things for ourselves  we want to feel  martinsons is a great coffee  its delicious and its hot and its brown  thats all you need to say  we dont need

television just to shorten your attention span  im sorry sir  i i was admiring your painting  the eye is drawn to it  its very modern  mark rothko ive read about him  and  what do you think about it
