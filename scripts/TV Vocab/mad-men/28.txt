onslaught  of negative public opinion in your attempt to demolish  the pennsylvania railroad station this year  and replace it with the new madison square garden  we shouldve torn the damn thing down during the newspaper strike  no one would have noticed  now lets take a look at the landscape as it were  save penn station  save penn station  rape on 34th street  stop fascism  how to kill a city architects inhumanity  to architects surpasses understanding  the new design is also ambitious  pedestrian and dull  ada louise huxtable is as green as that folder  people know that shes an angry woman with a big mouth  who writes for the new york times  i dont care if she wrote for the 10 commandments  shes trying to sell papers doing what they always do making people miserable  my greatgreatgrandfather silus stagman would have turned his boat around  if he had known that this city would one day be filled with crybabies  so whats your best weapon against lunatics   pink milford granite columns  i dont think its crazy to be attached to a beauxarts masterpiece  through which teddy roosevelt came and went  ive met the opposition i know crazy  do you know where the greatest roman ruins are  theyre in greece spain  because the romans tore theirs all down  they took apart the coliseum to build their outhouses  this is the coliseum have you seen the plans  in the new york

meet you roger sterling   ed raffit  our creative director don draper   edgar  have a seat please  lets get you fixed up  i only have a minute  edgar please  eat our sweetmeats drink our wine  i understand one of our copywriters  took a yetta wallenda  sized misstep  the girl the tightrope walker  they got her off the sidewalk with a hose last week  the point is we completely understand your problem  all we want to know is how we can help  youre supposed to tell me  well ive done all i can  don  in the interest of time  you want to demolish penn station and new york hates it  not all of new york a vocal minority  can they stop it  well i think all the hubbub is making it unpleasant for  but they cant stop it can they  why do you people insist on making us sound like villains  your concern over public opinion shows a guilty conscience  now what good is that serving you  if what is to be done is already underway  leave those  bring a couple of iceberg wedges  bleu cheese bacon  so lets say i dont have a guilty conscience  good  and lets also say that change is neither good or bad  it simply is  it can be greeted with terror or joy  a tantrum that says i want it the way it was  or a dance that says look  its something new  would you draw the line at 50  im not drawing a line at all  pr people understand this  but they can never execute it  if you dont like what is being said  change the conversation  what is that conversation  i was in california  everything is new and its clean  the people are filled with hope  new york city is in decay  madison square garden  is the beginning of a new city on the hill   just like that  its true isnt it  if i were to come to you  i dont want that kid on my account  the communist the radical  i will handle it personally  whats the matter poko  grandpa gene is gonna watch his program now  i just want to catch the end of the game  bleach poko  move  now the 22 delivery is high and away and its ball three  a full count 3 and 2  daddy seems well he has an appetite  oh he eats constantly  when i found out gloria was gone i was hoping he ate her  how could you not know about that  i went by but he lied to me  then finally when i let myself in he went bananas  hes ashamed   judy can get through to him  hes down in the dumps  but he seems very clearheaded  thats not true judy and you know it  hes angry and hes in and out  there is this place the parker home  its midway between us in new brunswick  and what happens there  he lives there its got everything plus doctors  its expensive but i thought maybe we could sell our house  that would give him enough to live on  thats very generous  do you think he belongs in a home   betty i know i dont get a vote  neither does don  all you care about is the house  you want to walk in there  see daddy on the bottom of the stairs  and have his last words be take the house  fine betts whats the solution  those homes are for people who dont have families william  hes a lonely old man and hes not well  hes your father   gene  thanks for the ritzy accommodations  youre an army man gene  drop your socks and grab something  lights out at 815 im impressed  i wish you would hang your coat up downstairs  its covered with soot  how bad is he  hes not the problem  what am i saying hes the whole problem  that and williams neverending bullshit  what now  he wants to put him in an old folks home  well i understand its not ideal  but it is the next logical step  don he just wants the house  he keeps nailing himself to the cross  for all i know judys pushing him  cut it out  what do you want to do  how can he talk that way to me in the condition im in   do you want anything  just throw it on the chair and stay here  be careful  im fine  its so funny how she is  my father and her fought constantly  she never remembers that part  family is important to her  i care about family  you know don had nobody at their wedding  nobody at all  why cant we just move in with him  ill take care of him  its bad enough to work for him  im a  i dont want to have somebody tell me i have the wrong tie on  raffit is sending over every piece of paper they have on the new garden  he wants you to see these new drawings  apparently theyre right out of metropolis   did he talk about television  i have a meeting on the books  he talked a lot about radio and kinsey  youre gonna have to keep a low profile on this  but it doesnt mean youre not working  mr pryce is here to see you  oh i didnt realize you were in the middle of something  did you come to treat us to a little newbusiness lunch  may i speak with you in private don   can i get you anything  no thank you  bad news im afraid  i just got off the phone with london  theres a problem with madison square garden  did their check bounce already  unfortunately theres a conflict  did you tell them its a stadium in the middle of new york city   its one of a kind  they know exactly what it is  a project and they told us to turn it down   im confused  its a question of economics  servicing madison square garden will require an account man  at least two copywriters two artists an ombudsman to city hall  all against 200000 in billings   thats for right now  precisely  from what i understand groundbreaking is two years away  madison square garden is our way into the worlds fair  the largest trade show in history  plus theres the garden itself  hotels concerts sports this could mean 30 years of business  theyre not interested im sorry  you told me to go out and get this account  i did i did my job  and now youre telling me its all for nothing  because you forgot to check with your boss first  whos running this place  i know this is difficult i take full responsibility  why the hell did you buy us in the first place  i dont know  tell mr campbell madison square garden is dead  do you have a second   can it wait  no  sal sent up the storyboards  what is this  its patio the diet drink for pepsi  yes everyone wants a drink that sounds like a floor   this is chinese  its all one shot  like the beginning of bye bye birdie   i havent seen it  well this is an ann margret type  fine  you really havent seen it you see everything  we have a few versions of a song  and the boys are very excited about finding this girl  im sure  dont you find her voice shrill  just throw yourself at the camera  its pure  it makes your heart hurt  no one seems to care that it speaks to men  not the people that drink diet drinks  what do the geniuses at patio want  maybe we should be talking about how this is better than coffee or dexedrine  its not about making women feel fat  this is look how happy i am that i drink patio  im young excited and desperate for a man  i dont mind fantasies but shouldnt it be a female one  peggy i know you understand how this works  men want her women want to be her   even if thats true  it is  im sorry if that makes you uncomfortable  well you know if we were making a movie or a play  wed be embarrassed to do this  its phony  youre not an artist peggy you solve problems  leave some tools in your toolbox  could you hold that   heading home  yes  let me ask you something youre a young girl   excuse me  youre the only one around here  who doesnt have that stupid look on her face  what does that mean  what would your father have to do  for you to not want him at your wedding
