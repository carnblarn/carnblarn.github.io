                   previously on mad men  but youre the new girl and youre not much  so you might as well enjoy it while it lasts  of course  you know who else doesnt wear a hat  elvis  thats what were dealing with  remind me to stop hiring young people  my mother passed away recently  i guess i already said that  i am appreciative of your talents and  i have made an effort to quantify  twentyfive hundred dollars  dance with me  i dont like you like this  mommy look at that  don draper  how are you  probably about like you  enduring the splendor of theorello  you know we got that israeli tourism thing right  mazal tov  i ran into jim jordan from bdo at the athletic club  with frank from ynr  your name came up  three millionaires in towels in a steam room   i dont know how to take that  take it as a compliment  a sign that youre destined for greater things  i think jesus over rio was the best tourist campaign  ive seen in over 20 years  it wasnt good enough to land the israelis  thats not you  thats the tiny store you work in  now if you were with me at mccann  youd have over 500 people at your disposal  and thats just in new york  we can get a lot of things done  can it get me out of the second half of this show  all im saying is youve done your time in the farm leagues  yankee stadium is on the line  i changed my mind  i decided you deserve a visit to the bar  adele this is donald draper   how do you do  if were being introduced  i assume that youre in advertising  would you both like to talk about that some more  betty my wife  jim and adele hobart  hello betty draper  pleasure  your husband here was about to prove  that he can speak about things other than advertising  hes very interesting  well then come with me  lets get those drinks  well be back  champagne  besides getting the handsome prince are you  an actress or something  no im a housewife  i did do some modeling  a lifetime ago  im not surprised  that is some face youve got there  anybody ever tell you youre a dead ringer for grace kelly  they used to  you know what  cocacola is deep into this  international campaign right now  a european face like yours like grace kellys  might be a road we could go down  we could put a call out for a grace kelly type but  i dont think wed come this close  you say youve modeled  im retired   this is silly  think about it  your coloring with a green bottle and an irish setter  drink up  its back to tammany hall  i like this show  very gay songs  well wed better get back in there  or leave  come on  it was very nice meeting both of you  good evening  why didnt you want to go to dinner with jim and adele  people like jim hobart always talk business  because they have nothing else to say  i could see that  you know he gave me his card  really  tell you to put it under my pillow or something  no actually  he was talking to me about modeling  was he  i dont think it was like that  he said something about grace kelly and cocacola  well then theres no need to doubt his interest then  i did model don  am i that wrong for cocacola  youre not wrong for anything  so are you going to go there  how was theorello exclamation point  itll be six months before  i can get don back into a broadway theater  we ran into this agency head  apparently hes courting don  he gave me his card  asked me if i wanted to do any modeling  thats a heck of a line what did don say  he basically said the man was trying to sleep with one of us  and he didnt like the idea of either  i did do some modeling you know  i did not know but im not surprised  carlton calls you grace kelly  yeah i was a model when i met don  a model in manhattan  yes  it was exciting  but when i got started  the summer after college in italy  italy  there was this italian designer  giovanni  he wanted to be called johnny  thats how much he loved americans  well he loved american girls  it was more of an artistmuse relationship  so he made you all this and it was platonic  no petting nothing  then put my hair up like this  and salvatore said he had the menkens artwork  but to meet him in the art department  because youre going to need a red pencil  any other good news  i think the mail boy dropped that off for you last night  welcome to the club call me jim  peggy can you get me an outside line  right away  now why would you call me out of the blue  i appreciate the gesture  its not a gesture don  its an overture  let me tell you youre a hard man to run into  i dont know what to say  dont say anything  the next step is a quiet rendezvous  the algonquin  theres a small hotel  isnt that the song  i dont know  im not ready to wave the flag just yet  what about the details  id rather do this face to face  but you already know what youre gonna say  i dont have to tell you the obvious limitations  of sterlingcooper  but youre going to  do i need to be careful here  its a mom and pop  mccannerickson is an international company  we have a network that extends far beyond madison avenue  europe south america  were publicly traded we issue dividends  small is bad  do you know the kind of clients we attract  pan am cocacola  esso  can you imagine the lifestyle  that goes with handling pan am  its a panty dropper  television  you could be in that in a bigger way you know that  but you want to sell corn we do a show about indians  imagine yourself in a three year contract   sterling probably hasnt let you break 30 yet  no comment  i really dont like doing this over the phone  all i can say is eventually you come up here  or you die wondering  he gave me his card right in front of don  well not right in front of him i guess  well i told don about it  i was a model you know  in fact i met don on a photo shoot  i was wearing this russian blue fox coat  he was just a copywriter at the fur company  i remember he saw that i didnt like giving the coat back  thats always the hardest part  he asked me out  he wasnt shy  i liked that  i said no  then three weeks later the coat arrived at my apartment  who knows what kind of indian trading he had to do to get it  i think i only had two more jobs  maybe three before we got engaged  and then i got pregnant  its always a nightmare raising children in manhattan  so we moved to ossing  suddenly  i really felt so old  tell me more about that  my mother was very concerned about looks and weight  and ive always eaten a lot  and i like hot dogs  my mother used to say  youre going to get stout  and then i became a model  and she hated it  even though susie parker made 100000 that year  my mother hated it  manhattan  she called me a prostitute  youre angry at your mother  what  are you going to talk now  you are angry at your mother  of all the things ive said in here  youre sitting up  you dont listen to me  you dont listen to what i say  and then out of nowhere you provoke me  tell me more about that  i miss her  i understand that  its good and bad  she wanted me to be beautiful so i could find a man  theres nothing wrong with that  but then what  just sit and  smoke and  let it go until youre in a box  i dont care why he gave me his card  whered you get this  kurt teasdale over at giltbascum  its already on the air they wanted to do it before she had the baby  am i the alone  i dont understand it  because its in spanish  i recognize that finishing school voice  you cant govern and listen to that all day  im happy to give up any spanish speakers and hope this goes away  well cooper thinks if kennedy creeps up any more in the polls  nixon will panic and theyll get desperate for our efforts  he wants everything in place  more risk  why are we doing this again and out of pocket  one dont question the wishes of our clients  clients come and go campbell  sometimes its best to rid them of unrealistic expectations  are you trying to say that we cant win  nixons got an eight point lead in the polls  not much  and we still havent figured out a way to make an impact  about the nxon campaigns involvement  my marching orders were undecided states  i think a plan of attack would make coop happy  the 5050s texas new jersey and illinois  no its easy to just say that isnt it  i think women will hate her  its like their better looking sister marries a handsome senator  and shes going to live in the white house  im practically jealous  hi  i called  i assumed you were staying in the city  the girl  we gave her a little extra work and now shes distracted  look at that  its raw don  don i realized something today  i miss modeling  you always told me you hated it  maybe the passing of time has made me feel differently  maybe its jim hobart  so what  its still an opportunity  you want to go back to work  a few days i mean is that so bad  i get paid  i can get ethel to watch the kids  she watches them half the time now  well thats three fourhour stretches  i think it would be fun to go in and be that girl again  youre serious  there will still be ham  i promise  are you resolved  is this even worth arguing  no its not like that  its just something id like to do  well i cant stop you from doing what you want to do  you have no idea how boring it is around here  really  i would think one hour on the sterlingcooper switchboard  would be a russian novel  they told me it would happen but the truth is you really just stop listening  and put ice on your wrists  peggy do you need to go home  what  the sweater  are you having one of those days  its not that  id like to go home but i just dont think i can  then what is it  youre not helping your silhouette  i ripped my skirt  you dont have a needle and thread  its a big rip  honey  ive got a spare outfit squirreled away you can borrow it  not exactly dressed for that are we  ive lost men like you before  and usually it had to do with my unexpressed confidence  i think youre one in a million draper  those are nice clubs  that bonus from cooper mustve made you happy  it was designed as a kind of an armor against men like jim hobart  howd you hear about it  i saw those clubs going down the hallway i thought they were for me  theyre from jim hobart  what did he offer  bigger  the world basically  it cant just be a number and a salary because you know were open to that  pan am  pan am  it is not mccannerickson  big talent attracts big clients we can try and make that happen here  thats true  but dont be fooled you hear pan am you imagine london  holed up at the dorchester with three stewardesses  the truth is its more like a 20hour boomerang flight  so you can make a coupon sing in spanish  and when you have stockholders like mccann does  you cant fire clients i know youll hate that  i thought about leaving once  but you know  its daunting  why entertain the prospect of failure   thats a sad thought  no  made me look at this place  i dont want to sound sentimental but its not just accounts  look around here at what you have  you want to start over  i havent made up my mind   im taking this very personally  why  its business  is it  mccannerickson is the major leagues   good let him go  youre right   maybe hell take me with him  can you imagine the money  i heard hes making 30 already  hes not ten times better than me  you love him  everybody loves him  sure his moods and the way he talks  i dont even know what hes saying half the time  clients do  ill admit she crossed my mind once  shes having a very bad freshman year  they went nuts for her writing  belle jolie she did that  belle jolie was okay she obviously let it go to her head  and other places  naw i dont think its the job  i think were seeing the real her  its one of those girls who slimmed down before she got here  now shes here and there she is  who thinks about her  maybe shell go with draper too  its a tragedy  a piece of fruit that went real bad  real fast  and no one ever got to eat it  well i got some work to do  suddenly upon news of other success  a young man is filled with ambition  drop dead  harry you busy  well hello i cant believe this  im sorry i overdid it  youre out of the business a few years and things change  please im overwhelmed with the style of you  betty draper meet ronnie gidridge  he handles the art for cocacola hes also my brotherinlaw   it is a pleasure  look at her   what did i say  you ready to work   im excited  its not that complicated  hes either gonna tell you to think about  something else or just stand there  jim thinks everyone elses job is easy  shall we  its just a tryout  no guarantees  i told you ive done this before  now where did you get that dress  so basically whereas sea corp previously  spent their money on local print and radio  we increase the network buy to 30 more points for each dollar  sea corp laxatives  you know i have to talk to those people  theyre not what you would expect  they have absolutely no sense of humor about their product  who knew that college was gonna get me out of the army and into laxatives  college was the moment wasnt it  fun and games  and girls  were you in a frat  alpha delta phi  also known as cut ups  we were the cut ups  we had this stray dalmatian  our mascot mamie  so it died and in classic fraternity manner we decided to throw a party  mamies funeral  one of the pledges pipes in that our rivals siu  they are so gung ho  siu is throwing a beauty pageant parade on main street  with the girl school down the road  now my friend chip hes a lawyer now says  why dont we go down there and get a permit  throw a grand funeral for mamie and let the girls run away crying  thats great  did you do it  we had police barricades and  who had the honor of pulling mamie in a radio flyer  thats beautiful  idiots  wait a minute  nixon and kennedy are both buying up airtime in these undecided states  its an arms race  nixon buys kennedy matches  so if we cant inease nixons presence we can decrease kennedys  how do we that  we make big buys in new jersey illinois and wherever  for sea corp laxatives  well hold on   so nixons selling laxatives  no  were selling laxatives nixons selling nixon  and kennedys watching mamies funeral  this is scary  it is isnt it  it was for me  who was it  im the girl the girl with the cola  its only a couple of days work  you know just a couple of photo shoots and then some kind of testing  but i guess you know how it works  i do  dont worry im not gonna ruin this  im very happy for you  i know you dont like it  but i know youre a little bit proud of me   come upstairs  no  right here  okay  how are these open already  well betty we dont want life to look difficult now do we  youre too much   polly no  let her go  if i see that dog in my yard again im gonna shoot it  i see you got there and back in one piece  yes  and even though i got lost i sent ethel home at four  they went to the park  and to visit ernie at francines  all in all everyone had a nice day  so how was it  there was this man ronnie i dont even know what his job is  ronnie gidridge hes the art director i met him  he is such a character  he tells funny stories  i brought the form home  i thought you could help me fill it out so i can get paid  id love to  sweetie pie  what happened  i had a bad dream  get in bed with daddy  what was your dream  i dont want anyone to shoot polly  no ones gonna do that honey  yes mr ford said he would because polly ate  one of his doves  theyre pigeons  he said this to you in your dream  no he said it today when polly ate the birdie  he wasnt hurt that bad he could fly  no one is gonna hurt polly  come here  nightnight  now they cant play in the yard  im gonna get my robe on and go over there and find out what happened  two in the morning  hes our neighbor hell make it worse  ill talk to him  you should have ethel talk to him  don they play in the yard when im here too  and she didnt tell you  im sure they didnt tell her  they probably wouldnt have told me either  theyll be over at francines for the next shoot anyway  its one day  im sure it wasnt that bad  maybe not  shes never slept well  thats not true  did you see those big tears  i really want to get a picture of her crying one day  i have to say don lucky strike even in this lawsuit is stronger than ever  it was a brilliant campaign  like some supersonic jet flying right over the market  i was there great work  thank you  sorry to interrupt who is responsible  weve made a significant commitment for as yet  unproduced sea corp laxative commercials  this didnt go by me  no it went by bob wilkins in media right to me  who is responsible  mr cooper sir it was me  you thought of this  well  i bear some of the responsibility as well  what did they do  every commercial block on air  in the land of lincoln is clogged up with  laxative buys  and a little bit of nixon time  the kennedy people wont know what to do with themselves  theyre going to have to put his pretty face  on the radio  and with that accent  nicely done  i didnt think you had it in you and i mean that   thank you  thank you  inspired  congratulations boys  peggy you want to write that down  don said congratulations  are we done here  i really thought it was gonna go bad for a minute   i was sure it would  no kidding  you almost let me detonate  so much for camaraderie  mr rumson sent this over  unopened very nice  hildi stay have a drink its an order  no thank you im going to my parents after work  you know when something good happens to me it also happens to you  i know that i said congratulations  you should do something with that sourpuss youre very beautiful  just being honest  i love watching you walk  i should go  you should  is he in  always nice to see you  i can give you my assurance that nothing good  will happen to that boy  though i cant seem to keep my word on that hard as i try  i might ask you to take me with you  i see no reason to leave  or maybe i see a million  a million  is that what its gonna cost me  i was thinking more like 40   im not gonna be a little girl and ask you why you stayed  i know its not money  and i hope its not to keep your foot on pete campbell  i like the way you do business  well i try to be as civilized as you can be  no contract   well whats in it for me  if i leave this place one day  it will not be for more advertising  what else is there  i dont know life being lived  id like to stop talking about it and get back to it  ive worked with a lot of men like you  and if you had to choose a place to die it would be in the middle of a pitch  ive done that  i want to do something else  jim hobart mccannerickson  of course  line one  incredible pictures am i wrong  no youre not  so your wifes already here with us i know shes happy  why dont you join her   i dont know about that jim  you can do better than that  you know what im offering here  its yankee stadium i know  what did sterling come to the rescue  is it about money i have to say i mightve judged you wrong  its not  im surprised  i thought your wife coming here meant you were interested  no that was her idea  cant blame me for trying  maybe not but  cant exactly say that was a big league move  alls fair no stone unturned right  its a pity to lose both of you youre a very lucky  man landing that woman  whats going on with mr draper  even if i knew i wouldnt tell you  very good  ive been meaning to give this back to you i had it completely dry cleaned  why dont you keep it  have it taken in here and let out there  its your dress  hot tea thats a good idea  what are you talking about  you are falling prey to a very common situation for new girls   im not new anymore  well thats just it  dont you want to do well here  im the first girl to do any writing in this office  since the war  marge told me  writing  is that what this is about  i thought you were doing that to get close to paul  thank you again  i heard you were being considered for an account  because a clients wife saw you and thought  it would be okay if he worked with you  you know youre not a stick  and yet i never wonder what men think of me  you are hiding a very attractive young girl  with too much lunch  i know what men think of you  that youre looking for a husband and youre fun  and not in that order  peggy this isnt china theres no money in virginity  im not a virgin  no of course not  i just realized something  you think youre being helpful  well i am trying dear  im going home  did you have a good day  i did it was splendid  well betty i have some good news and some bad news  theres bad news  the clients moving the international work to london  more audrey hepburn less grace kelly  i see  as for us well were going back to the malt shop  the good news is you have two wonderful sets of pictures  to start your book again  thats true  i really am sorry  this was fun  you can keep the dress and the hairstyle  i dont do that for everyone  honey it has nothing to do with you  thank you  what do you think paul should we move this whole thing  down to macdougal street  doing great here  good she left  probably wasnt gonna happen for her tonight  depends how much we

drop you at the station  sure  campbell you sucker punched me  what is wrong with you  come on  you just had a fight and i was not part of it  either you two make up  or i do not stand a chance tonight  perfect timing  the children are down  but only because they were running around all day  they fell asleep in front of the tv   how did it go today  good  fun  they were talking about a whole string of other possibilities for me  but honestly  i dont think i want to work anymore  i dont like you coming home to some  whipped together mess of whatevers left in the fridge  and frankly i dont like  manhattan on my own  its harsh  it can be  and what am i going to do  run around the city with my book  like some teenager making a fool of myself  if thats what you want  and its my job to give you what you want  you do  look at all this  i dont know what i was thinking  birdie  you know i dont care about making my dinner  or taking in my shirts  you have a job  youre a mother to those two little people  and you are better at it than anyone else in the world  at least in the top 500  i wouldve given anything  to have had a mother like you  beautiful and kind  and filled with love like an angel  youre sweet  and this does not taste whipped up  no  its good isnt it   have a good day daddy  you too  were going to the community center to watch them fill the pool  that sounds fun   have a good day  i already am  mommy im eating  be careful dont jump off the bed  okay  mrs draper  what the hell are you doing  mrs draper
