theyre coming to see you   why  theyve shown a great deal of interest in you  ever since you swung around your privates  in the boardroom with duck last year  bert they study and dissect your work  trying to decipher  what is your particular american genius  what is your particular  what do you think it is the presidency  no i think itll be a creative umbrella  with a dual position   london  byebye don  how congenial you two are  i hope you can maintain this pretense when they arrive   excuse me  kiss and make up  before you cost us all something  before you cost us  youre being

will steal from your spotlight  perhaps we can reschedule your surprise party till after the holiday  why did you do that  do what  mrs harris knows everything im sure she was expecting it  mrs harris knows  im going to go home and make a celebratory dinner for my husband  and when you wake up in the middle of the night  and wonder what you forgot dont call me   well thats smooth  i got a shave   why  they ordered me to do it  we have an inspection tomorrow the british  well you look very successful  hot or cold  swedish meatballs or chicken salad  chicken salad  did you pick up a nightlight

could tell something was wrong  he wouldnt look me in the eye  i figured he felt bad  and that id at least find out what the hell happened  but he didnt feel bad  what are you talking about he loves you  he sat me down in his office  he poured a drink and he said  he said i had no brains in my fingers  but he wrote you all those nice evaluations  damn it joan doctors dont write bad things about each other   so youll go to another hospital  not in new york  if i want to stay in surgery  i can go to alabama or something  so what happens  youre still a doctor right  i am  just not a surgeon  and i will never be a surgeon   did they fire you  i dont want to talk about it joanie okay   did they fire you  i was hoping you were asleep  i have another year of residency  youre not gonna be able to leave your job  greg thats done  well get another one  honey  listen  you are still a doctor  i married you for your heart not your hands  they all went out to celebrate  i couldnt do it  i just

mercedes benz   thats very impressive  i apologize  i didnt realize he was going to recite  my entire curriculum vitae  my entire  you left out modest  well were going to debrief mr pryce  and the plan is for you to join us for luncheon  in the conference room at 100  sounds like agatha christie  well apparently our tour continues  i look forward to how do you say  catching up  i as well  well

pleasure  please see to it that guy has a space to prepare   right away  gentlemen  theres coffee and cake  were very impressed lane  very very impressed indeed  in nine months youve trimmed every bit of excess  increased billings and we havent heard a word of complaint  yes well pax romana and all that  yes well  bravo weve decided to offer you something  that we hope youll view as a reward and a challenge  is it in the box  in a manner of speaking  open it  ooh what is that  it looks like a snake  fancy that  is it real  it was  its for our snake charmer  its for  were sending you to bombay  bombay  what would i do there  well hopefully the same thing you accomplished here  uh umm  where shall i put this  i guess i neednt find a spot for it   if im simply moving again  dont pout  one of your greatest qualities is you always do as youre told  no its just the logistics  my wife just settled  my son just accepted to school and now were moving on  nonsense youre moving up   mmm  thats the spirit  so without further ado  i will give the floor to guy mackendrick  let me begin by offering my warmest wishes  and admiration for lane pryce and his exemplary work  itll be hard to lose him  but theres no doubt that our loss is indias gain  now let me say theres no cause for anxiety  there will be no further reductions in the ranks  yes thats good news  if i might id like to walk you through this slight reorganization  as before ppl london will be the head of this body  and sterling cooper now more than ever  our american presence  our business maturity with your creative edge  a triumvirate of don myself and mr cooper  our chairman emeritus  will oversee three streamlined departments  creative art and copy  account management thats mr cosgrove  and mr campbell for the present  and a combined television media department  headed by mr crane  mr sterlings not on that chart at all  thats true  oh well that was an oversight  as you can see nothing much has really changed  frankly my presence here is just to ensure thorough communication  that we help each other on both sides of the pond  whether it be a sharing of creative genius  media savvy  or the unbridled acquisition of new business  im sure you all have  but for the time being i say we inform the troops  so that the transition can begin immediately after the holiday  shall i have mr hooker prepare a memo  no nonsense i dont want this to be the kind of place  where such news is delivered that way  shall we  gosh were really going to miss you   what the hell just happened  they reorganized us  and youre the only one in this room who got a promotion   really  yes really  i apologize for my wild imagination  thats not what i want to talk to you about  whats this  its for you  for my new big sister the best in the world  and my goodness its from baby gene  look  baby gene cant write  tsk babies get fairies to do things  you know that  its really from him im not kidding  i think you should open it   what is it  its a barbie  i think he wants you to know  that he wants to be your friend  and you are very important to me too  im sure you all have  but before i raise a glass to sterling coopers future  i should like to recognize its past  most recently the inspired stewardship   of lane pryce  hear hear  im also aware of a rather significant milestone  mrs harris  from those who have known you only hours  to those who have cherished your nearly 10 years of service  i wish you caviar  children  and all that is good in your new life  oh there there that wasnt my intention  mrs harris please  well have our presentations tomorrow  let this afternoon be a fete worthy of joan  enjoy the liquor and delicatessen  thank you  thank you all  this is completely unnecessary  youll be sorely missed  we got you the cake  well  so what now they keep adding people above us  one more promotion and were going to be answering phones  we should go say hi  this is good champagne  i dont

your business  okay  but the next time somebody like me asks you  a question like that  you need to think bigger  well connie  there are snakes that go months without eating  and then they finally

whats happened here   that were not to be trusted  shes an idiot   i didnt know she couldnt drive  you took the machine out  you have to have respect for that equipment  its very safe when operated correctly  we had the world handed to us on a plate  and then you swing in on a chandelier  drop your pants and crap on it  drop your pants  jesus its like iwo jima out there  we should put a rubber mat down so cooper can get around  theyre changing the carpeting  any news  he might lose his foot  right when he got it in the door  oh god  sit down sissy mary youre pale  i take full responsibility  believe me somewhere in this business  this has happened before  happened before  joan my god  i know its ruined   how is he  i didnt expect you to come over  i just thought you should know  honestly

wait  despite the circus today  i hope you know that you are going to be terribly missed  thats nice to hear  especially from you don  i bet he felt great when he woke up this morning  im sure youre right  but thats life  one minute youre on top of the world  the next minute some secretary is running you over with a lawn mower  lane oh   im heartbroken  its a terrible tragedy  one that surely could have been avoided  although mrs harris thank you for your quick thinking   you may have saved his life  such as it is  he was a great account man  a prodigy  he could talk a scotsman out of a penny  now thats all over  i dont know if thats true  the man is missing a foot  how is he going to work he cant walk  the doctor said hell never golf again  im afraid we have to reevaluate our entire strategy  lane will remain here indefinitely  well close the office tomorrow obviously  mrs harris please allow the company  to reimburse you for that dress  just as a token of our gratitude  i think
