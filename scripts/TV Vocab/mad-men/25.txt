for the spending bills which bring new jobs  actual advertising not public relations  i have your fatherinlaw on line 1  tom how are you  well peter um  to be honest  i dont like having to make this phone call  oh why not  well weve been thinking about things over here  and were going to have to put clearasil up for review  really  thats a shock tom  now  why would you do that sales have been spectacular  all right calm down  i said review not that were moving  youll have 90 days to turn it around  turn what around  youre distracted  what are we talking about tom  look son  every good businessman knows that  if his wifes unhappy his work suffers  yes they seem very directly related in this case  dont they tom  trudys happiness should be your first priority  i think you should pull clearasil right now  i dont think youre going to get what you want  what about my daughter  shes my wife thats between us  you know what  i was in love with trudy when i met her  and then you stuck your nose in  put these ideas in her mind and made her unhappy  what do you mean you were in love with her  thats not what i meant and you know it  yes um perhaps it is best if we just give notice  goodbye tom  i bought you some clothes  tomorrow morning  theres something else  what  i met a girl  another one  shes so beautiful and happy  shes a model  and shes from a good family  and shes educated  whats her name  elizabeth betty  i want you to meet her  look at you  youre in the lavender haze  i just like the way she laughs  and the way she looks at me  yes  you are very hard to look at  i wanna ask her to marry me  oh dick thats wonderful  well i need you to give me a divorce  of course  i never thought of that  you should hire a lawyer out here ill pay for it  and i want you to

new life  thank you anna  so wheres don  im sure you remember peggy olsen  shell be walking you through this  and when don climbs out from under the weather  don has signed off on all of this  when i was little  my mother would take a twin pop  and break it in half  and give one to me and one to my sister  we were completely equal in her eyes  beloved  everyone does this with popsicles  but they may not realize what it means  it has nothing to do with an ice cream truck on a hot summer day  or the flavor  or the color  its a ritual  you take it break it share it love it  people do do that  this act of sharing its what a popsicle is  its the same treat from the freezer as it is from the truck  i dont care if its snowing or hailing or 100 degrees  you can still take it break it share it and love it  i like the way shes handing out the pops  the kids are excited but  the mom reminds me of something  no this is original  well i can tell you this now  but we wanted something with the word love in it  when asked the first thing people say is  i love popsicles  carson residence  sarah beth its betty draper  oh hello betty  im sorry  im at my wits end  sally  i think she may need

he told me all the things you said about me  i was grateful  why would you do that  what  you wanted him too you know you did  theres a difference between wanting and having  you did everything you could to encourage me  i didnt make you do anything  my god youre an awful woman you know that  no one made you sleep with him  im going to tell you this and you can tell all your little friends  this
