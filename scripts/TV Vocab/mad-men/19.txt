this for ten years   the playtex people are jealous  they shouldnt be  maidenform is a dream but playtex is a bra  ive never seen either brand go wrong  i had four of these up in my dorm i didnt even know what advertising was  why now sales are strong  someone has a wife with an opinion  they would like to do what maidenform is doing  not what were doing  why then they both have the same campaign  i love how they dont need a diagram  peggy do you wear playtex and if so why  i do  and i agree with the 95 women we surveyed  about how well it fits  i find they both open easily  i like a happy client although youd think someone would be able  to talk them out of jumping onto a bandwagon as solid as this  maybe they want us to raise the bar  why because their share of the market keeps increasing  you see them every four months why not throw them a bone  let them see theyre paying for creative  just wrinkle it a little  i went to sleep in my bra and i thought i was soandso  thank you for that  just for fun lets say were looking for new  and by new i mean old maidenform  peggy you dig in around playtexs unique benefits   just the man to do it  what do i tell them  tell them you

 errol flynn is gone and so is my taste for swordplay  you two need to put them away  i have  ive been married for over 20 years i know the difference between a spat  and spending a month on the couch dont go to bed angry  two hot chocolates  i dont want it  sure you do its good when its hot to drink something hot  if you continued with the scouts you would have learned that  patty you can use the phone but miss morrison works for me not you  daddy has a morning meeting  theres a food cart itll be here in 20 minutes  no scraps for chauncey  i have money i have 150   mark  thats good  how did you get that tidy sum  mr reeve gave it to me  and why would he do that  because he wants us to be happy when he marries mom  we all want you to be happy  and whatever his intentions its very generous  he already asked her  you must have known eventually  that your mother and i might be starting new lives  we understand we dont care  its not easy for her  with you away at st pauls now shes lost her man of the house  franklin reeve is a good man  moms going to stick you with chauncey  what  were supposed to say goodbye to him  she cant make you do that  dad hes your dog  and ive learned to live without him  so you two kids could have some consistency  franks allergic  your mother will be here in a half an hour   where are we  we had an interesting idea  we  are you on playtex  he wants to get credit for his idea  you sure about that  we went out the other night after the meeting  you know a little extra hours after hours  and i looked around the bar   we all did  from what i understand  playtex has an amazing bra but it doesnt take you anywhere   well put  so i was thinking  women right now already have a fantasy  and its not going up the nile  its right here in america  jackie kennedy and marilyn monroe  every single woman is one of them watch this  jackie  marilyn  jackie  marilyn  marilyns really a joan not the other way around  that is an idea  and an impressive presentation  well you always say its a 24houraday job  apparently ive already signed off on it  i dont know if all women are a jackie or a marilyn  maybe men see them that way  bras are for men  women want to see themselves the way men see them  youre a jackie or a marilyn  a line and a curve nothing goes better together  which do you think i am  gertrude stein  i would say youre more classical hellenic  irene dunne  i love irene dunne  peggy youre going to have company on this  congratulations kinsey  you forced your way on to an account  mr phillips is here  sorry im late  get back out  whos the new account man  its chauncey sorry about that  listen any idea when i can schedule playtex  were laying track i think you can bring the train in tomorrow  something new i hope  can i drop some crumbs at least  two sides of one woman jackie by day marilyn by night  maybe its two girls  but definitely two flavors   vanilla and cherry  sounds good  don your girl says youre free for lunch  shes in charge  come on chauncey  come on  thought you all were listening lets go  what sweetheart  i wish you would have told me you were going to work tuesday night  if you have something better ill run it by don  he already likes that  yes he does  isnt that our goal  im not saying i had a better idea but now im not even a part of it  all i had to do was be in that bar  believe me you didnt want to be in that bar  the works done  now go write me some titillating copy  mr draper is here to see you  send him in  are you coming by to pick me up  no  its just i wasnt really planning on coming back after lunch  any way we can have this conversation now  conversation  roger told me it was just a friendly lunch  i know  people start giving you things they think its cute  ive got a crate of that crap somewhere  thats quite a playing field you have there  i dont like anything on it but ashes  i thought maybe your secretary was better than mine  nobodys secretarys better than yours  you creative directors  all i can say is its been hard to figure things out around here   we cant be that unusual  im doing the job you hired me to do  i tell people that sterling cooper is the only place to be  youve been pitching more to me than you have the clients  what does that mean  it means youve been selling their ideas to me  more than mine to them  when i was in the marine corps i missed duty  fell down the steps or something  my squad leader covered  but then i confessed to the men  he laid down some rifle fire for me  and i acted like i didnt need it  thats not the situation i want to be in here  so what youre covering for me  who am i in this story  im grateful don  if you hadnt brought me in where would i be  some fifth wheel at mccann  look i did everything i could for you on american airlines  it was a risk worth taking  people think of us differently  what do you want me to say  that were on the same team that i love being in your unit  sarge im scared  you have an i told you so okay  can we move forward  im the one who looks bad  it hasnt hurt the company  yes of course we can  and i will tell roger we had lunch  well good then  where did you come from  you

dont have one  i was going to get one for the office  i dont think thats a good idea  good night campbell come on chauncey  what were you doing in sterling cooper  there was a casting call for playtex  oh right  fellas are calling it the brations  thats funny  you work there  i do  want me to find out how it went  i already know not well  i find that hard to believe  they fall in love with a picture of you  and then you come in and theyre disappointed  but it doesnt make any sense  because all they need is a picture  i didnt bring my camera with me  but i cant imagine it being better than this  i dont know maybe i look tired  i just flew back from working in london  london  whats your name  peter campbell  oh my account executive  i love the taste of scotch  thank you  stop turn around  let me look at you  when i first saw you  i thought you were foreign  really is that right  hold that  i have company  ill be right back   who was that  my mother  really  what you didnt think i had a mother  its okay  hold on  you want me to fix you something  whats that  cereal  no that  do you like it  i bought it at the auction  can i speak to you a minute  what whats wrong   where are you going in that  swimming  you asked me if i like it i dont  what are you talking about  im talking about a 15yearold lifeguard  im talking about a bunch of tennis pros  not to mention all those loafing millionaires taking the summer off  do you want to be ogled  everybody bought one at the auction  its desperate  i didnt know that  i have to go  see you tonight  joan there you are  are you aware that im on the playtex account   what about it  please tell the girls  i am to be included in all the memos  sure for a moment there i thought you were just another person  coming to ask me about my brassiere  why arent i on the list  i dont know what to tell you im not involved in that  theres business going on and im not invited  im a good drinker  what are you asking me  you know how this office works  parts of it   forget it  ive never had your job  ive never wanted it  youre in their country learn to speak the language   you dont talk that way  i dont need to  and honestly  youve never listened to a word ive said  you want to be taken seriously  stop dressing like a little girl  jacqueline kennedy marilyn monroe  women have feelings about these women  because men do  because we want both they want to be both  its about how they want to be seen by us  their husbands their boyfriends their friends husbands  heres the idea very simply  the bra is called the harlequin  in fit and form it should be your very best  it comes in black and white  jackie marilyn  same incredible fit  two different women  and the beauty of it is its the same woman  the same model  look at that it is  and even if you dont notice it you still get a bit of an aha  when you read the copy  nothing fits both sides of a woman better than playtex  its a very impressing idea don  i like the girl  so will your customers its a very flattering mirror  this definitely moves you into maidenforms neighborhood  but sales have been so good  when we talk about how well our brassieres fit  i dont know what to say  we were talking in the cab on the way over  let maidenform have womens imaginations  well take their money  i couldnt have said it better myself  i apologize for the goose chase  were very sorry  no one else can have this campaign right  its yours  well keep it on file for you  a pleasure   thanks again  thanks for coming in  that was a waste of inspiration  these people  dont worry its not your fault  they made up their minds on the way over  why put up a fight  i think we bought a couple years of security  if they ever decide they want to go that way  they know we can do it  listen we would love to show our appreciation  by entertaing you gentlemen tonight  and you can put it on our bill  make sure don knows hes invited  where should we go  surprise us  if we were to take you to see some girls in their underwear  would you feel like youre at work  no that sounds good  let us clear the decks  thats on 44th and 8th  we will be there and the tab will be open  im going to go tell campbell  take care   good to see you  see you there  mr phillips  we have artwork in the evening papers son  and i dont have them  someones supposed to put them on my desk friday or not   should i
