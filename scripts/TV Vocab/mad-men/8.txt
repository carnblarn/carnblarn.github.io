thought  lets have a glass of champagne  im sorry  were going to live there a long time  theres no point in being superstitious  its as simple as e pluribus unum  from many one  from many shades of lipstick  one that belongs to her  from a basket of kisses she picks one  it makes her unique it colors her kiss  and her kiss well it colors her man  belle jolie lipstick  mark your man  i only see one lipstick in your drawing  women want colors  lots and lots of colors  mark your man its pretty cute  you like this  well maybe we should cut down to five shades or one  im not telling you to listen to anyone  but this is a very fresh approach  its okay kenny  i dont think theres much else to do here but call it a day  gentlemen thank you for your time  is that all  youre a nonbeliever  why should we waste time on kabuki  i dont know what that means  it means that youve already tried your plan and youre number 4  youve enlisted my expertise and youve rejected it to go on the way  youve been going  im not interested in that  you can understand  i dont think your three months  or however many thousands of dollars  entitles you to refocus the core of our business  listen im not here to tell you about jesus  you already know about jesus either he lives in your heart or he doesnt  every woman wants choices  but in the end none wants to be one of a hundred in a box  shes unique  she makes the choices and shes chosen him  she wants to tell the world hes mine  he belongs to me not you  she marks her man with her lips  he is her possession  youve given every girl that wears your lipstick  the gift of total ownership  sit down  no  not until i know im not wasting my time  sit down  you know how to get back to the roosevelt  we could have someone walk you over or just meet you if youre interested  youre a troublemaker  although it is a place to get into trouble  they just did this incredible renovation  it reminds me a little of a steamship  and the people i was in the lounge last night  and i end up having a drink with robert mitchum  actually many drinks  now you know we wouldnt steer you wrong  nice work i think you may be right about this  well never know will we  what  its not a science hugh well do our best  that jesus thing  i dont know what to say  probably better than dangling him out the window by his ankles  thats just a story  dons never actually done that  ken you will realize in your private life  that at a certain point seduction is over  and force is actually being requested  hes a kid he thinks its the other way around  peggy ice  well

its prime target traveling salesman  in that suit  i should say not  no im not one of those boys who looks forward to a business trip  to escape the wife and kids  im really a homebody  but new york  when you arrive and that train starts slowing down and it gets all dark  my heart pounds and i think  im going to climb that staircase and be in new york  i take it for granted  it is a masterpiece of some kind  wherever im staying i always demand a view  its building after building  little compartments filled with possibilities  whats that from   what  no im just saying its its like you can do anything  im two ahead of you i have to eat something or im going to continue  to rhapsodize  what time is it  i bet you dont have an expense account  im not saying peggy doesnt have something

too much to drink  you are very petite  going back to the well interested  dance with me  i dont like you like this  literally  with flies  the espresso beans mean health wealth and happiness  seems redundant i mean if you already have health and wealth  so are you happy  im one of those people who thinks the minute you ask that  youre not happy so  no  youre loud but youre shy  i feel like im getting my fortune told  im sorry  its fine  so what do you want to do  i dont know  let me break off with one of the writers  have my own little shop where copy follows art  and not the other way around  no i mean my view  you have to see it  its all the way to the park  of course its dark now  i dont know  may i  i  dont know what to say  its elliot  and salvatore you dont have to say

creeping around every corner  here  youre an honorary  this is how we talk to each other  on the front gate of every house  theres a mark  its a code just like you heard on the radio  see  thats a pie  it means the food here is good  this one  that means watch out for the nasty dog  this one here  that means a dishonest man lives here  and this one  that means tell a sad story  here  dont be scared kid  you aint a man yet  of course  what  you two  youre in love  what  thats ridiculous  every day i make pictures where people appear to be in love  i know what it looks like  looks like a magazine  love is bourgeois  youre breaking my heart  dig ad mans got a heart  the grownups are talking  dont defend him  toothpaste doesnt solve anything  dacron sure as hell wont bring back those ten dead kids in biloxi  neither will buying some tokaj wine and leaning up against a wall  in grand central pretending youre a vagrant  you know what its like to watch all you ants go into your hive  i wipe my ass with the wall street journal  how come every time we have a party  the ladies have to sit and listen to the men talk  look at you  satisfied dreaming up jingles  for soap flakes and spot remover  telling yourself youre free  my god stop talking  make something of yourself  like you  you make the lie  you invent want  youre for them  not us  well i hate to break it to you but there is no big lie  there is no system  the universe is indifferent  man  whyd you have to say that  paris  now lets go  no i cant  buy yourself a car  the cops  you cant go out there  you cant   sir  good
