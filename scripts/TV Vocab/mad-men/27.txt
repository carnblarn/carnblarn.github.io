offering me a chair  how cruel of me  i wanted to inform you  that youre now head of accounts  excuse me  it seemed like the right thing to do  despite your lack of hospitality  the uh specifics are

water retention  peggy brides are very selfconscious  if shes so worried about getting married  then why is she shamelessly flirting with money penny  dont call him that all the time  he hates that

gonna say anything  my fathers extremely concerned  about the business right now  what was it about our work  i mean we dont want to take credit for everything  but uh two of every three raincoats sold last year  had london fog stitched on the inside pocket  dad was worried that everyone whos ever going to buy  a raincoat already has one  because a business has to get bigger every year  thats capitalism  well our worst fears lye in anticipation  thats not me thats balzac  balzac huh  you are not burt peterson  ive been investigating umbrellas bags hats  there are companies that all they do is make hats  london fog is a  that sounds like its existed forever  and youve established with our help  that it means one thing raincoats  new products aside  there will be fat years  and there will be lean years  but it is going to rain  thats true  lets see if we can find you some ear plugs  bacardi bel jolie birds eye cadbury  campbell soup international  cartwright doublesided aluminum

fortycents of every dollar at this agency  is spent in the television department but no we did  what are these others for  olson  shes all over the place  you know thats not true  youre each taking half the company  course its possible someone could distinguish themselves  could be easier that way  can you believe this  if youre upset you seem to be hiding it  im excited  i mean i feel badly about burt peterson  three kids wife with cancer  but you greased up the shoot and shoved him down it  what could possibly be the matter  why did you even accept this  you have no interest in this  why wouldnt i want this  because youre no good  they want us to hate each other  i refuse to participate in that  very nice  veryvery nice  look at you never break a sweat  youre right i should just lay down  and we should run together holding hands  what time is it   we should be back in the office by three  were going back to the office  im gonna ask you something and i want you  to be completely honest with me  london fog  its a subway car  and theres a commuter looking up  theres a girl with her back to us  shes wearing one of those short tan ones  but its open  her legs are bare  we know what hes seeing  limit your exposure  thats it  good  mr hooker may i speak with you  i thought it was a good idea that ppl had an office  for when visitors come  course it would make since for someone  to be occupying it in the meantime  i wrestled up an office for you  i hope you find it appropriate to your status  my position  steer mr price not exactly in the thick of things  but you will have someone to attend to your typing  to avoid you siphoning off the man hours  my own girl of my choosing  i will have a lineup  did he take the ant farm  no its actually mr coopers  oh it just lives there  hello sweetheart  now dont be cross  ill only be a minute  you have a fever  no  peter campbell the buck stops here  huh the buck stops here  unless it stops over there  whats the matter  theres two heads of accounts  kenny cosgrove and i are sharing it  oh im so sorry  i was sitting there and they just  read off a list of names  a list of companies  thats my life  i know you wont like hearing this  but youre a lot like my father  youre an ambitious man and an ambitious man  is never happy with what he has  why does it always have to be like this  why cant i get anything good all at once  this is an amazing opportunity  they believe in you  dont turn it sour  its a test  why not just cut it short and tell them i want it  you can do whatever you want  but they do not want to hear your outrage  they want you to beat ken  i know what they want trudy  and honestly i dont know  i cant live with this  but youll try  its great  its a great ad  so how was everything in baltimore  out of town don draper  first class  go on  two old married men  oh there was a fire in the hotel  buno casualties  thats too bad  for casting this lucky fellow in the subway  whats he look like  i dont know a little excited  a little shocked  no whats he look like  oh handsome  the girls gone  i have stolichnaya and cuban cigars  sent them from greece  shouldve tried a pound of opium  help yourself  so cosgrove versus campbell  is cooper playing god or darwin  i know it sounds japanese but its not cooper  whatd lane read about it in some management book  i think it came from the home office  when he told me about it i thought he was joking  i told him it was a stupid idea  but they dont always get our inflection  can i speak with you for a moment  come in  oh  what  i um  i just wanted to let you both know  how honored i am with this promotion  help yourself  not the stoli  hello  oh mr campbell i was going to tell don  but i can tell you myself  i have an old pal at the mayors office  that wants to do a small campaign for  i dont know something about penn station  itd be my pleasure bert  is there any brandy  any glass will do  i told him that despite life under british rule  we still had a real yankee  i dont care what they say  london fog is a great name  i like the ants  theres no shortage of distractions here  now if we can find a proper pub  well have everything  why do you have this office  i thought it was necessary that we have a place  for when superiors visit  of course it would make sense  for someone to occupy it in the meantime  thats a hairbrained idea  we just fired onethird of their workforce  its unseemly to go through their pockets as well  a visitors office is good but you sit out front  of course it was presumptuous  this place is a ginocracy  hadnt noticed  my only point is if you decide to take the train tomorrow  and you run into carlton i told him you were busy  our stories are straight  sally has something to tell you  sally  i got it out of her  out  go ahead  im sorry i broke your suitcase  find out how much it is to repair  and itll come out of your allowance  i dont have an allowance  then dont break things  i just thought i just didnt want you to go  come here  i will always come home  youll always be my girl  your eyes look tired  i dont sleep well when im not here  you squint too much  you need reading glasses  daddydaddy  are these for me  yes  give me that its a stickpin  there ya go  was i really in there  nine months  tell me about the day i was born  well it was uh the middle of the night  and it was raining very hard  and i had just got home from work  he did not feel like getting back in the car  but he did  i took my suitcase  and my little stuffed eeyore  that i knew i was going to give you
