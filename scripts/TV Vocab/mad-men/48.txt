didnt order this  its a gift from a friend tip included  what friend im not allowed to say this  in greece right now make no mistake thats a revolution  we are a hair away from everything falling apart in every society  its so tenuous  all these corporations just throw their money at everyone  to keep the status quo intact cause the people outnumber them  but in the blink of an eye they could overturn everything  its an illusion that americas so organized and it could never happen over here  are you from brooklyn i am  me too i dont hear it  one more drink and itll come out  okay  what am i talking to you about corporations for  you must deal with them all the time i guess  vick chemical american tobacco  but most of them are family businesses  samsonite fillmore auto parts sugarberry ham  fillmore auto parts is worse than a corporation what with the boycott and all  what boycott the southern stores wont hire negroes  says who  it was in the voice it was in a couple of places  i dont think thats true i wouldve heard that  it is true  that doesnt seem like them  im sure theyre perfectly nice for racists you know  and obviously your company has an investment in looking the other way  well its a complicated idea  but in advertising we dont really judge people  we try and help them out of these situations  certainly we would try and stop this  if its true its not good for their business  jesus i dont even know where to start  you wouldve done a campaign for goldwater  you kidding that wouldve been spectacular  did you vote for him of course not  civil rights isnt a situation to be fixed with some pr campaign  its an inequality that the world has its eyes on  i know  but i have to say  most of the things negroes cant do i cant do either  and nobody seems to care  what are you talking about  half of the meetings take place over golf tennis  in a bunch of clubs where im not allowed to be a member  or even enter  the university club said the only way i could eat dinner there  was if i arrived in a cake  theres no negro copywriters you know  im sure they could fight their way in like i did  believe me nobody wanted me there  all right peggy well have a civil rights march for women  i have a really early day  it was nice to see you again  im just saying theyre not shooting women to keep them from voting thats all  jesus im really sorry  im much better on paper  youre opinionated and youre criticizing me  thats not what im doing this is discourse  i knew i shouldnt have let joyce leave  have a good night  a threeletter word for a flightless bird  emu  nope it starts with an l  the hell it does  good morning mr draper  could i get some coffee and let me know when dr miller arrives  its hard the way she breezes past me  shes pushy that one  i guess thats what it takes  morning good morning  and thank you for what  that was very thoughtful  i knew i was rubbing you the wrong way  so i thought why not have someone rub you the right way  i brought you bear claws caroline wont let me have one  unless its on the end of a real bear  well anyway jeanie  itll be okay people love to say that  look i know youre having a tough run  let me get you a meal  take your mind off things  of course  i forgot for a second that youre incapable of doing something nice  without expecting something nicer in return  i didnt mean anything by it  honest  just thought you could use a night out  thank you im fine good  what are you doing here i wrote something  i kind of wrote it for you  i would love it if you read it  nuremberg on madison avenue  what is this its what i was trying to say last night  but without i dont know my abrasive tone read it  right now in front of you  no take your time ill wait over here  i have a lot to do  i came all the way up here i want to know what you think okay  these domesticated suburbanites  still have a primitive desire to get their hands dirty  but they have become so removed from nature that they cant  they dont know how to hunt or swing a hammer or fix their cars  you mean like these two  actually no im from vermont and dons a competitive fly fisherman  what our findings show is that this demographic  will spend a good amount of money  for the satisfaction of being useful with their hands  ladies love a man whos good with his hands  you think a mechanic comes in and sees these jokers  looking at fan belts hes gonna stick around  no offense  whats the difference our inventorys the same  i think if they see a coat and tie in aisle four theyll think our prices went up  i know i would  listen salt of the earth we need more than mechanics to survive  you ever hear of sears theyll kill us  we agreed we all had to agree  dont we have enough problems with the boycott  look i dont want to get involved in a family squabble  but i cant move forward until you agree on a strategy  what if there were a way to market to both groups  fillmore auto parts  where the pros go and everyones welcome  its a little corny its great and you know it  thats not a strategy thats two strategies connected by the word and  i can do where the pros go or i can do everyones welcome  but not both sure you can  someone has to make a decision there are three of you  vote  sean what do you think    dont know what  youll have to excuse me for a moment continue please  why do we have to convince him  what are you doing here  i wanted to see you  i am so sorry who are you  my name is vivian winters  and im going to assume youre her father since thats what shes led me to believe  don what exactly is going on  i found her on the train between carriages trying to avoid the conductor  i didnt have enough money  megan could you take her to my office  go  thank you  can i pay you for the ticket and your time  youre just very lucky i ran into her before someone else did  the types on that train someone should keep track of her  youre right i didnt know  men never know whats going on  i offered you money and i said thank you  she looks so chubby in the pictures  get her mother on the phone now  what do you think youre doing  i wanted to see you and i didnt want to wait two weekends  you cant do this this is very serious  mrs francis is on the line  guess whos sitting on my couch right now  what are you talking about  im talking about a stranger bringing sally to my office  because she got on the train with no money  youre kidding  carla was supposed to pick her up after the doctor  how the hell did this happen  dr keener thought it would be good for her  to walk from camp to her appointment by herself  great idea thank you psychiatry  dont yell at me she needs to learn responsibility  you need to learn responsibility  now come get her ive got a business to run here  because its so easy its so much fun to take care of her  enjoy  what enjoy don  im meeting henry in the city tomorrow night ill get her then  dont move and dont touch anything  i dont want to hear it just make sure she doesnt leave that room  are you serious with this  everyone knows who represents fillmore auto parts  were the agency of record but i was defending you  we have a religion in this country and its business  youre not a priest youre just another congregant  so im not a war criminal  look why should someone nice like you have to do this  why should you have to be a part of that corruption  its a waste of yours and a million other artists gifts  if you publish this ill lose my job  maybe youre better than this  im not a political person  i dont have to defend myself  youre political whether you like it or not  and youre not supposed to be insulted youre supposed to be flattered  are you crazy  you inspired me i wrote this for you  i guess i read you wrong  you look so earnest  i need your word that youll destroy that  sure  i wont bother you again  miss blankenship  miss blankenship are you all right  miss blankenship  miss blankenship  caroline oh god caroline  do not come out of there i know  what now  excuse me mr draper im really sorry to bother you again  are you sure im afraid so  what happened  jesus  poor thing  should we call an ambulance  the coroner  what about them  ill attend to this sallys in there  why shes visiting  megan get a man and well need a blanket  theres an afghan on mr cranes couch  she seemed fine just a minute ago  so where are we  have we agreed on a strategy im not sure  this is where we are  correct me if im wrong gentlemen  but we believe by holding onto fillmores reputation  as a place for professional mechanics we can actually attract men of all types  so its something like  fillmore auto parts for the mechanic in every man  and although it seems immaterial to you the fillmore brothers like it  unanimously  what was that again  fillmore auto parts for the mechanic in every man  my mother made that  can we get your signature  im the president  i think this is a winner  gentlemen always a pleasure  ken can you show them out of course this way  my goodness i was just talking to her  listen my daughter is sitting in my office  what she decided to run away today  sally id really appreciate it  if you could go in my bag get my
