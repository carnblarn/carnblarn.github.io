                   previously on mad men  you have any idea how unhappy i was before i met you  i was thinking of leaving my wife  they call a girl like her a lobster  all the meats in the tail  if it is kennedy nixon will lower himself to the occasion  its going to be kennedy  my mother used to say youre going to get stout  tell me more about that  i miss her  im living like theres no tomorrow  because there isnt one  com   season 1 episode 10 long weekend  running in the house  grandpas here and his aunt gloria  if i leave can you keep your mouth shut  elizabeth are you hiding your sugar bowl from me  gene i think i have some packets from the howard johnson  daddy have a saccharin or nothing  where is your sugar bowl  do you want to wake up with a cold leg like grandpa herman  diabetics dont live long and sometimes they lose their legs  hey grandpa  good morning   good to see you gene  don  this is my friend gloria  i heard you might be joining us  its good to have another woman around  give betty a break  i live to serve  hey you heard that right  i have a witness  shes a hell of a sport  don will you help me with the suitcase  were only going for the weekend  i cant get it out of the closet  honestly its unseemly  i can imagine everyone at the club  was she waiting at the funeral  unbuttoning her top button like at some sadie hawkins dance  she seems like a perfectly nice lady  what am i supposed to do with this fill it with hay  how far do you want to go with this  oh ill say you talked me out of it  shes a vulture  her husband was a failure  when he died they found out he cheated on his income taxes  and her kids louise never married  two more years and shell be hanging out at funerals too  huntley he was my brothers age   he was always funny  birdy  your father was married what 40 years  the man can hardly fix himself a cup of tea let alone do laundry  all he needs is a housekeeper  a housekeeper goes home at night  let him have it  and that fake smile  youve been looking forward to the beach  let her cook  let your father put some stones by that wall  so we stop getting water underneath the deck  i guess i wont have to worry about talking to her she never stops  just get through today  ill be there tomorrow afternoon  well go to that place with the lobster rolls  just come now  you hate the way i drive  well my father taught me  half the office has cleared out  kennedy kennedy kennedy kennedy  do you like a man who answers straight  a man whos always fair  well measure him against the others  and when you compare  looks like a maple ad  its incredible  happy days are here again  im just wild about harry  its light its fun  doesnt cloud the mind with  i dont know issues  its catchy  catchy like it gets in your head  and makes you want to blow your brains out  the president is a product dont forget that  i would like to talk to you for a moment about dollars and cents  your dollars and cents  now my opponents want to increase federal expenditures  as much as 18 billion a year  how will they pay for it  there are only two ways  one is to raise your taxes  turn it off  the other  an ad made by a public relations team  message received and forgotten  we should give this to franz for some music  nixons campaign song in the key of e  ethal go get the ice pick  that nixon guy is on tv again  shouldve never been this close  id say we could run them again but i dont think you want to see them  ive seen them which reminds me  you people arent watching enough television  it is your job the shows and the ads  i was just wondering there must be any number of people  harvesting mud on johnny kennedy right now  have we heard anything  we hear things nothing useful hes a womanizer thats not gonna hurt him  women find out about that itll push him up to the top  nixon is still ahead in the polls  shouldve never been this close  why do we need to attack when theres a story to tell  kennedy nouveau riche  recent immigrant who bought his way into harvard  and now hes well bred  great  nixon is from nothing  selfmade man the abe lincoln of california  who was vice president of the united states  six years after getting out of the navy  kennedy i see a silver spoon nixon  i see myself  if we were to run a critical ad there are obvious benefits  when you run an ad thats positive  youre only convincing the people who are already voting for you  but when you run an ad thats critical  you get a shot at the people on the fence  there are a lot of people on the fence  gentlemen whether the nixon campaign wants it or not  we have to produce a spot that aims a howitzer at kennedys balls  i want to hear ideas  after the long weekend  i agree lets go down swinging  if we can switch to a conversation about paying clients  menckens is coming in today to sign off on the roll out father and daughter  i get the feeling old abe schminken can kill this whole thing  of course the checks have cleared already but  don i want you to go in and ride bareback over paul here  done  and don i want you on your best behavior   excuse me  i know she bothers you  miss holloway may i  i really need to get to the bottom of that  yes i would like to get a look at those  margaret and mona are off to block island for labor day  gone for the weekend along with every other wife in town  we can go anywhere tonight we can see a broadway show  and sit at any table at the colony with our clothes off if we want to  how about a movie  have you seen the apartment  i went last week with mona and margaret  i hear shirley maclaine is good  please  a white elevator operator  and a girl at that i want to work at that place  i bet you do  the way those men treated that poor girl  handing her around like a tray of canapes  she tried to commit suicide  so you saw it huh  red thats not how it is  look it was crude thats the way pictures are now  did you see that ridiculous psycho  hollywood isnt happy unless things are extreme  it didnt seem that extreme to me  are we actually gonna get in a fight over a movie  you know mona had a dream once where i hit the dog with a car  she was mad at me all day  and i never hit the dog we dont even have a dog  why dont i call you later  call me soon because we can go anywhere  the new atrium will make the store brighter and more vibrant  the aisles will be wider spotlighting these new chrome display cases  over here will be a new restaurant  elegant tea room  modern classic signs and champagne linens  a tea room nice  but 30 of my ground floor  is devoted to the restaurant business  lunch and shopping a day of indulgence  thats what ladies like  yes i saw that in the chapter here  its much longer than the little schedule  it says we have to close our doors  while its getting nailed together  three months of construction  during which time we build enormous anticipation  its like a movie premiere  the new menckens  you will have a line the first day  even if you have to pay people to stand in it  well do whatever it takes  mr draper  my daughters presence here should let you know  that i am not against change  and let us assume that this is  the most amazing idea in retail since buy one get one free  i still dont understand  why we have to throw out the baby with the water  cant i keep what i have and just build on it  honestly the unpleasant truth  is you dont have anything  your customers cannot be depended on anymore  their lives have changed  theyre prosperous  over the years theyve developed new tastes  theyre like your daughter  educated sophisticated  they know full well what they deserve  and theyre willing to pay for it  why would i want to own a store  that i wouldnt want to shop in  mr mencken i dont know if thats true  you had no problem abandoning that second  floor hosiery store on 7th avenue for your present location  and thats a story youll be proud to tell your grandchildren  the only problem is they wont care  as much as grandpa likes that marble palace  i can promise you they wont  theyll look at it and theyll say  grandpa it mustve been hard back in the olden days  and it was  everybodys jumping to forget it  excuse me  this is not some phony story you people print  in your fourth of july circulars  my father actually started with nothing  and he made it into everything were talking about  who here can say that  i meant no disrespect sir  none taken  this is the plan daddy  as you can see it wasnt just thrown together  it does seem very well thought out  it is  pleasure to finally meet you  i hope you two know what youre doing  looks like we both get to keep our jobs a little while longer  dont screw this up  i think he likes me  i guarantee you there is nothing about you he likes  what about you  daddy can we  this place reminds of a czarist ministry  no matter what the decision you dont feel it was yours  fortunately i have no idea what youre talking about  hes very good persuasive  yes  a little dashing for my taste  carol  its 1030 did we have lunch  cause even i cant leave this early  no i need to talk to you  why arent you at work  dont tell me youre late again do you need to see dr emerson   good grief joan  then what  you walked 12 blocks in a heat wave  and i see you didnt take my advice about the dress heels  you know how mr aldridge has had me reading the slush pile  yes writing the rejection letters you told me its depressing  im so stupid  this morning in the submissions meeting  the editorial director asked why we havent responded  to this poet from yale marlin rice  mr aldridge tells him we never saw it  then the director asks me  and i cover for mr aldridge  i said that i had read it and rejected it  then they made mr aldridge fire me  honey thats awful  he was really sorry about it   of course that sob   i know  im going to have to ask my dad for money again  its humiliating  stop it you shouldnt be embarrassed  theres never enough money  you always seem to manage  these men  constantly building them up and for what  dinner jewelry who cares  we need to go out and shake all this loneliness  all i want to do is sit in the movies and cry  no movies  lets look for some actual bachelors  empty their wallets   i hate manhattan sometimes  dont say that  this citys everything  wheres howdy dowdy at  what can i do for ya  i just got off the phone with brett rowley at dr scholls  dont tell me theyre coming in again about the exercise sandals  did you tell em summers over  theyre not coming in ever   theyre going to the leo burnett  what  why didnt he call me  probably because they were disappointed with the creative  rowley called it dull and humorless   and what did you say  what could i say  ive never lost an account before  especially one that was here before i got here  so you really put up a fight  he had very strong feelings  he said some unpleasant things  which you dont remember or im sure youd tell me  the day you sign a client is the day you start losing them  are you going to tell sterling or should i  unless you think it can wait until after the weekend  ill take care of it  were you buzzing me my intercom was making a funny sound  leave it  you wear dr scholls inserts  i thought we all had to  take them out  get rid of this please  we lost dr scholls  where  leo burnett  campbell enjoyed telling me it was something to do with creative  thought i should tell you make sure the ink is dry on that raise  that fat piece of shit  hes a cigarette ash  chicago what a joke  small time  sorry maybe youre from there  i know i didnt drop the ball on this  sales are steady  probably didnt help that  our billings crept up for no apparent reason  eventually an accountant is gonna read the mail  if youre trying to cheer me up its working  the day you sign a client is the day you start losing em  you dont really believe that  you know what my father used to say  being with a client is like being in a marriage  sometimes you get into it for the wrong reasons  and eventually they hit you in the face  damn it  are we supposed to cry about this so we lost an account  that means well just have to cut back  lets go fire somebody  labor day weekend  between now and monday  we have to fall in love a dozen times  bettys at the shore im headed down tomorrow  what do we work so hard for  to have enough money to buy fabulous vacations  for our family so we can live it up here  give me tonight you owe me that  i can use you as bait  theres a casting call at 400  doublesided aluminum  if
