was left to both of us  i dont understand why i shouldnt be able to buy it away from her at double what dad paid for it  they bought it in the late 20s  dad alwa said it was the top of the market  your father intended you to get as much money for it as you could  if you were going to sell it  otherwise somebody has to buy somebody out  so basically dad gave it to betty because he knew i didnt have any money  this is ugly you know that  milton i need to speak to you in confidence  i need your advice  i need complete confidentiality  its my husband  i just found out some compromising facts  he uh hes been married before  and he  well its not even his real name and he bought her a house his exwife  i i need to know what to do  i dont know him betsy i met him at your wedding  i know your father didnt want him in the will   so  what do you want to do  do you want a divorce  in new york state you need to prove adultery can you   maybe  i mean prove it in a court of law  thats hard to do   unless he wants out but youre not gonna get anything  you wont even be able to buy william out of the house  youll have to sell it  and he can take the children  thats my legal advice  do you want the rest of it   are you afraid of him  no  is he a good provider  well he is but thats not the point  its a lie so big milton  i feel like ive been in some dream since i found out  just saying it out

call in a focus group right away  thats enough business  i want to know everything thats happened in the last 20 years  longer  it wasnt until years later  that i realized you were the only person i could remember that time with  what do you want to remember  what i was like at that age  paris before the war  eating in cemeteries  people were jumping out of windows and we were on vacation  i dont remember much  are you trying to tell me when you saw casablanca you didnt think about me  you mean peter lorre  you seemed so happy to see me and now youre just being drunk  look annabelle  we were not in casablanca  the only similarity is that you left me for another man  when she gets on the plane at the end  that woman got on the plane with a man who was going to end world war ii  not run her fathers dog food company  you were adrift you didnt do anything but spend money  you walked around like you were hoping to be a character in somebody elses novel  the boxing  im not gonna sit here and listen to your reasons  believe it or not i still remember them  oh jesus wheres the wine  i dont like the way youre looking at me  how am i looking at you  with pity  i finally found a beautiful carefree girl unconcerned about the future   i was more serious than you  well i got mine  i married mona joined the firm  and then i got shipped off to the pacific for the duration  when i came home i went to work while you were watching casablanca  and i got blamed when we lost the account  all i heard was my father said bert cooper had a screw loose  look youre rich  let someone else take your horsemeat and slap their label on it  and do what   oh i dont want a whole bottle  ill help  and i told him the closest we ever got to hemingway  was sitting in a chair he once sat in  and that was in the 20s not the 30s  and then he said he remembered me  because i was the one whod introduced him to peanut butter  yeah i never understood that they had peanuts in europe  no one ever thought of that   look at us  oh will you stop  roger do i look like a widow  you look great  you still want me  so what  im married  newlywed honeymooning  how could i have missed the window between mona and her  there really wasnt much of a window  it kind of overlapped  well i was there first  well just take this and tack it onto that  im gonna get you a cab  are you afraid ill be disappointed you were always good drunk  annabelle let me get you a cab  its different with this girl  im sorry  good night  howd it go  i screwed up all my answers  and i tried to talk about the articles but i couldnt remember anything  i made a fool out of myself   i am sure thats not true  you werent there  stop acting like you know everything   youll have other interviews  i dont want em  i dont want to be a psychiatrist  its not medicine  i might as well work at a bank  i dont care what you do as long as you do something  we need money  i did everything i was supposed to do  everything they told me  college med school  i wanted to be a surgeon since i was that big  im sorry greg  maybe its time to move on  hey you dont know  you dont know what its like to want something your whole life  to plan for it to count on it and not get it  okay  ah oh shit  what the hell  youre insane you know that  why isnt he wearing a white coat  he looks like a dogfood salesman  dogs dont like uniforms  well were lucky everyone has an appetite today  they said we should bring them hungry  but he does seem to like this  how would you describe your dogs temperament  shes picky and shes nervous sometimes   but shes very smart  and yours  hes independent you know  he knows what he likes hes pretty hard to fool  oh my god theyre describing themselves  this your first group  what if i told you your dogs were enjoying caldecott farms   whats it called  i wouldnt like it   bingo stop  ive never heard of it  well you should they make it out of ponies  goodness gracious thats this one  this is the first im hearing of this i wish you wouldve told me  when people are protesting im on board  well what brand does your dog prefer   why would you do this to us  its inhumane   bingo looks sick  turn it off   could somebody get that  i cant turn it off   its actually happening  turn off the sound  i already know how people feel its your job to change that  any agency that does not change the name is stealing your money  the product is good its high quality  dodogs love it but the name has been poisoned  that name got us where we are  do you think that was just luck  im not saying a new name is easy to find  and we will give you a lot of options  but its a label on a can  it will be true because it will promise the quality of the product thats inside  well im going to wait it out  and not for these morons but for another agency to solve my problem  jesus annabelle let it go  the name is done  its unfair but its over   annabelle  are you ready for the next group  i dont like the way youre speaking to me  everybody out  is this about last night  i dont even remember last night  oh well you threw yourself at me and i turned you down  im right you want to hurt me  no no i dont  you
