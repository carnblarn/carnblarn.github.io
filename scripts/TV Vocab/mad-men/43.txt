                lee lee don doesnt think theres a problem  lee those restrictions arent going to affect lucky strike  besides lee your lawyers came up with them  no more smoking teenagers we complied a year ago  no more famous athletes  and we have to stop using certain angles  low angles wide lenses  anything that makes the smoker appear superhuman  why is this empty  because you drank it all  he cant hear you theres kind of a loophole  because even without athletes you can still use sports  bowling for example seems a natural ht  bowling is a sport lee  how about horseracing  lee lee the jockey smokes the cigarette  did either of you ladies bring any ice with you  were sorting out the focus group for ponds and i havent gotten the hypothesis  in writing anyway  he said don  well do our best peggy write it up  you havent okayed the brief  i liked your idea i liked it a lot  the mirror one or the cleansing one  whats the mirror one  well i think its about the ritual the multiple applications indulgence  ponds is the only cold cream that allows me  to stare at myself in the mirror for 20 minutes  and feel good and not vain  thats very good  so were talking about girls 18 to 25  can i grab a few from around here  yeah help yourself  see i would never buy a sailboat  i dont want to do things myself  for that price that boat should have a motor  a what  one of those too anything else  i dont know why dont you ask don about that  i have to go to the little boys room  im sorry lee can you go through that one more time  thats the lucky strike call why wasnt i told  be happy i saved you an assache  so whats so bad he couldnt tell me  cal rutledge from chesebroughponds has a wild hair about clearasil  he thinks theyre in conflict  pimple cream and cold cream  a rather broad definition  does it matter  look pete were going to have to resign the clearasil account  why lane  it cant be up for debate  clearasil is worth 125 million in billings and ponds over two  no  you know what it took to get my fatherinlaw  to join this new firm to begin with  fifteen percent of 750000 is near 113000  roger i dont expect him to understand this  but do you have any idea of what ive had to do to keep that account  the personal toll ive paid  i do but youve been good to him remember that saleswise  mr sterling i dont believe this  roger throw yourself on a grenade  protect the agency youre a partner now  this evening if you can  over half this agency is dedicated to your needs  but if you want to get into the linebyline  of the costs weve billed for  ill have

just wanted to wait till our anniversary to tell you  i dont care trudy  i dont care how i heard  peter  how did this happen what did the doctor say  he said i was going to have a baby  i want to pick you up and spin you around  but i dont want to damage anything in there  im so happy youre happy  i dont know it feels much different than i expected  how would you know what this feels like  come get off your feet  how are you feeling  tell me youll forgive my father  they already think you hate them and honestly its my fault  i dont hate them  i shouldnt have taken my mother to the doctor not that doctor  its just i thought something was going on  and i was so prepared to be disappointed  or that god forbid something was really wrong  trudy i had to talk to him because the agency has to drop clearasil  why theres another product thats similar  and we cant a conflict  peter im familiar with the term you use it all the time  i invited him there and his good news trumped my bad news  and the funny thing is that was the moment to tell him  i was so bowled over  we did it  why dont you let my father hear this from me  hes already so guilty hell never feel the knife go in  i cant let you do that  but im the one who talked him into returning to the agency to begin with  we needed him and now you dont  hell be fine tomorrow night  yankee pot roast  lets go caroline will be watching your desk  why dont you have to do this  you dont have to do this youre getting paid  were old and were married they dont want us  but i use ponds i do  come on  girls rind your places megan help me

right i thought you wanted faye not dr miller  yes but i told someone to leave the e off of faye  i like to be able to correct it in front of the girls it makes them trust me  because your name is

in mr sterlings office  he wont be coming  as i said my name is faye  i dont have a name tag  i guess they forgot about me  they got mine wrong im dotty  i mean im not a dotty person thats my name  hello dotty  so theres no reason to be anxious  we have to enjoy the fact that were all getting paid not to work for a little bit  but dont worry thats our little secret  and id like you to think that this is just a bunch of your friends  as if maybe this is a sorority or a bridal shower with tea  or just a bunch of us celebrating say allison s birthday at my apartment  you shouldnt be surprised looking around the room  that were here to talk about beauty  what are the things we all do to keep ourselves beautiful  or simply to enhance it  please pass a danish  you dont have to raise your hand anyone  i can say it  i have a routine  i brush my hair 100 times just like i did when i was a little girl  but of course only the night before i have it set  very cute can you imagine  your financial futures in the hands of a roomful of 22yearold girls  not mine  okay sometimes i watch my weight  no ones hungry  id like a danish  i dont use ponds if thats what youre asking  thats okay  im of french extraction and my mother has beautiful skin  she never washes her face  shes not dirty she uses water but nothing else  and you do what she does  what does she do  she stands at the sink  and she runs the water until its just the perfect temperature not too hot  and she splashes it on her face and she pats her cheeks with her fingertips  and she looks at herself  yes she does  shes amazing  i sit at my vanity and i have this night cream my boyfriend laughed at me  what was so funny about it  it was just you know one time  at christmas eve we were staying up late and we were playing house i guess  you shouldnt do things for them they dont appreciate it  you dont think they appreciate you being beautiful  we broke up a year ago  actually i dont know what he noticed but it wasnt me i guess  its worse when they notice sometimes  allison please continue  its nothing  are you in there yes  i asked your girl to inform me of your arrival  shes in that group  did you speak with tom  im sorry it didnt happen the opportunity passed  well then we shall endeavor to recreate it perhaps lunch today  im afraid rogers already informed ponds that this was attended to  thats sloppy  i have a lunch but im seeing him tonight  damn it  lane  i just found out im going to be a father  well now that should take the sting out of all of this  i suppose  i apologize  thats the very best news  congratulations  thank you  and i just kept thinking why does he stare at other girls  well men do that but does he look at me that way  and were not married so who am i  how the hell did this get so sad so fast  i know im speaking for everyone here  but you cant think it has anything to do with how you look dotty  you can only do your best with what god gave you  what about makeup  i feel like it doesnt matter what i see  it matters what he sees  i feel like i gave him everything and i got nothing  i could see she was gonna crack  allison  are you all right dear  its okay shell be all right should i  if she wanted to be around us she wouldve stayed  sarah what do you do that makes you feel good about the way you look  i feel kind of responsible do you mind  is there any kind of ritual  i think my strategy was right  they just wanna get married and theyll buy anything thatll help  are you all right its you  come with me  people cry in these things all the time grown men  i was in a bunch when i first started working here  id say half the time somebody cries  really  i think it just feels good to talk  i cant even say anything because i know hes right out there  right through the glass  who  i dont know how you stand it  the way he turns on the charm one minute and then yanks it away  how can you even talk to him  don  would you stop it  i realize you mustve gone through everything ive gone through  but now i know its just hes a drunk  and they get away with murder because they forget everything  i dont know what you think  forget it  your problem is not my problem

call for you  ive gotta get this those goniffs at cbs are screwing me again  those what order for me caesar salad no dressing  you wanna take a look sure  listen ive gotta get this out of the way  but i would appreciate it for the future  if you would not say shitty things about me behind my back  what  come on are you gonna deny it and make it worse  i dont know what youve heard but its not true  you didnt call me an allamerican idiot who fell into everything  whom did i supposedly say this to  does it matter  well id like to defend myself  i heard that you told your wife that i was driving the tractor  when the accident happened  what i dont think so  what i probably said was that you were involved  we all were and that it was your account  and crane told me yesterday you said i was marrying for money  i didnt say that he did  well hes like that and everybody who knows him knows that  but when you say it and especially when it gets back to my fiancee  trudy knows her you know some garden club  i was unaware of that  look you know what  i apologize mea culpa  textbook harry  you know what hes buying lunch  i dont really care im just glad to be out of the office  it is nice especially without having to listen  to some client yammering about how dirty the city is  hows it going  ive been floating along laterally but i dont know that its a love affair  its better than mccann what was that like  are you kidding me its the worst agency ive ever seen the worst  my mother was a nurse at the state hospital in vermont  and that was the last time i saw so many retarded people in one building  so youre getting married congratulations  its all that really matters right  actually i have a bit of news of my own  trudy is with child  good for you good for you  ill be honest i cant wait  its very good so far  a new family a new agency has to be exciting  well you know wherever you do this job youre doing this job  i know youre all slaves to draper over there  but id rather be a slave to creative than some old fart  whoever pours the last drink gets all the credit  and youre spinning your wheels half the time  right now were chasing mountain dew  supposedly were going to turn it into pepsi  but the only reason pepsi would do it is to make bbdo sweat  this whole idea that wed get the bigger company is a joke  wed just end up with a bunch of little pieces  well the grass is always greener  who am i kidding look how lucky we are  another campbell thats just what the world needs  can i come in its your office  glad to see youre feeling better  if you dont feel like working  what  im very embarrassed  people cry in those groups all the time allison  thats not what im embarrassed about  this actually happened  i know  i know  we made a mistake  and i feel like its awkward and its better for both of us if i move on  i dont think thats necessary were both adults  no i really would feel better about it  a friend of mine told me about a job at a magazine  and i thought that might be interesting working for a woman  anyway i  i would appreciate it if you could write me a recommendation  absolutely what would probably be even better  is if you type up whatever you want and ill sign it  what  youve been sparkling in your duties  just put it on my stationery put whatever you want and ill sign it  i dont say this easily but youre not a good person  allison hold on  whats going on  im gonna need a new secretary and this cleaned up  would you be open to allison returning in a couple of days  if thats what she wants really  no  theres a
