clients  they love the idea of just sticking a key in the door at sterling cooper  really  is this as solid as american airlines  i guess youre happy having to scramble on the third tier of this industry  waiting for minor divisions of major companies to drop in your lap  on the table will be mountains of money  international prestige a chance at going public  and we dont have to change our name  i guess we could think about it  no i need to know that youre open to this  if so im giving them five business days to try to impress us  with a price for controlling interest in the agency
