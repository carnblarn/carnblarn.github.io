with your job  only an idiot would put jimmy barrett in a room with her  no visits  how bad was it  he called her the hindenburg  and uh he said something about the whale in pinocchio  did you laugh in front of the schillings  of course not i was mortified   you know my mothers heavyset  i stopped it right away  so what were dealing with here is that you failed to control jimmy barrett  and you failed to control mr and mrs utz  so maybe both of you arent suited for these tasks   mr phillips is here  perfect  utz is going to lose jimmy and were going to lose utz  god i miss the50s  has anyone tried to save this yet besides leopold and loeb over here  cant get the schillings on the phone someone needs to talk to jimmy  im sure hell feel real bad about it tonight and give her a call  don can

something  are you trying to think of what you could possibly say  to make up for whats happened here  what happened  i think youre not suited for this job  what did i do  in addition to being incompetent  you threatened my reputation and not just today  mr draper i try to cover for you all the time  you do not cover for me  you manage peoples expectations  can you be more specific  you really want that  no i guess not  youre not suited for this job its not an insult  its just the way it is  stick to the switchboard  please tell miss holloway on your way out  yes mr draper  is there

sponsors over here what do you need  dont get excited sponsors drop out for a reason  not always  okay try this on  the defenders top 20 show  e g marshall bob reed lawyers but you know they really care  so this writers turn in this script about a cannibal  a cannibal lawyer  the director eats up all this time refusing to do it  like his resume isnt filled with crap and surprise  the writers have only one other script ready  something we threw away last year  because they used the word abortion   why  because they show one opening scene  exactly the whole thing was a ploy to get us to shoot it  they think theyre so clever i tell you i miss the blacklist  send it over i want to see it  im sure its going on the air sponsor or no  ill watch it with you in the bar where ill be working  send it over let me see what i can do  all right  miss holloway good morning  ill be taking care of you while we search  for a suitable candidate  i am really sorry about that  did she leave everything in a condition you can follow  perhaps if you were involved in the selection  what can i tell  ill just continue looking for another miss olsen  no i want someone wholl be happy with that job  well for the time being thats me  how about a cup of coffee i think i remember how you take it  sure   is jimmy barrett shooting today  yes at eue  what time do they start  they were supposed to start this morning  but mr barretts been showing up around 4  wake me at 330  well start with your correspondence  did you go to that office for the purpose of obtaining  an illegal operation  yes   were you pregnant  yes  then you went to dr montgomery for an abortion  yes  was the abortion performed just a moment  mr preston arent you going to object  the witness is not a qualified medical expert  the defense is willing to concede that an operation was performed  on miss stafford which resulted in the termination of a pregnancy  very well you may proceed  come here a lot do you  not if everythings running smoothly  so buy me a drink  i think theres been plenty of drinking here  jimmy around  he left early rehearsal at the copa  forgot this  isnt that our tuxedo  he likes it better  great so lets go talk to him  theres no reason for that  talk to his manager  how can i help you  im sorry in the pitch you were introduced as his wife  would you prefer i pretend to be his sister  like i did in the old days  wife manager someone should have kept a lid on him yesterday  ive seen the man sober hes not funny   mrs barrett  bobbie  he can come in here with vomit in his pockets for all i care  but these people are his benefactors  like the medicis of florence  theyre patrons of his art  mr and mrs utz  i want you to imagine something that jimmy obviously cant  the schillings were very excited to see their favorite comedian  then they know that being picked on by jimmy barrett is a compliment  no one was laughing  thats not what i heard  ill tell you what  theyre in the big city for the weekend  why dont they just go out and buy a thicker skin  you are aware that all of this can go away  no more free tuxedos  we have a contract  tell jimmy i need to talk to him  you  jimmy doesnt have a lot of patience for business  or for businessmen  in fact im pretty sure he already hates you  really  some glib ad man in that suit  cigarette perfectly in hand  not a hair out of place here to tell him hes been a bad boy  well he has been  so what do you suggest i do  he has to know that youre a fan  and that he knows more than you  and that hes got a shot with your wife  girlfriend both  wife  so whos going to have a talk with him you or me  neither of us  i have to go  let me drive you over  give up will you  its raining  whats that  hail  bobbie  don  i dont want to

names  wheres your girlfriend mrs carson  her daughter has a ballet recital  im really not afraid you know  ive just always been more comfortable with animals  when they were on the other end of my rifle  thats a terrible attitude  it is and ive tried to explain it to tara  but she wont listen  all the men in her family ride like this  i also dont work so maybe im wrong about it  i should go warm him up  tallyho  ill be right back  hello  hello its don draper can you talk  im glad you called  how are you  werent you afraid youd get jimmy  no i wanted to invite you both to dinner  monday

weekend  did you have a nice ride  dont smoke in here they hate it  i dont know place burns down i could give this up  i assume youre trying to be funny but most of the people who ride here  hold on mrs draper  im so sorry thats not what i meant  just because you dont know what youre doing  doesnt mean the rest of us are silly  i apologize  girls and their horses  i cant figure you out  why would you want to do that  when tara came to visit i could tell she was jealous  of your two old lady friends  she certainly seems like a girl who has everything  she does  when she was at wellesley  she came for a couple of weekends to new haven  i remember those  so exciting  we got into a kind of pattern where  thered be a warm reunion a football game  and some kind of obscure argument  you know i would soothe and she would pout  you know mr case having been married for some time  i can tell you your fiance would be very unhappy  with you sharing this with a stranger  arthur  i dont know why i brought that up  i guess i just rembered going home with her that first time  pulling off the merritt parkway and hitting this long private road  you know that scott fitzgerald story  a diamond as big as the ritz  no  her house is a slightly smaller version of my high school  and i realized why she was so happy all the time  and then why she was so angry when she didnt get what she wanted   all girls are like that  you arent  you dont know that  you are so beautiful  thank you  so different than tara  tara is very beautiful you know that  she doesnt need anything  what she does need anyone can get her  youre nervous about getting married youll see  you dont know what shell mean to you  but i think about you  why would you do that  arthur i like being around you  dont say anything to ruin that  youre so profoundly sad  no  its just my people are nordic  dont do that  dont tell me what to do  youre so profoundly sad  youre wrong  im grateful  how was it  im sorry im late thank you for watching them   come in here  i should get cleaned up  i dont care  listen  how do you feel about lutce monday night  lutce  pleased i guess  and you get to meet jimmy barrett   why  business  hunt schilling from utz potato chips and wives  is this one where i talk or i dont talk  you need to charm him  i need you to be shiny and bright i need a better half  monday night   you have plans  ill have to find something to wear  its no notice no notice at all  birdie  well go there alone another time  what is it  what is it whats this got to do with you  he helped me says sam  is this you  theyre writing this about you  answer me are you mixed up in this   answer me  mr mason  you keep out of this  sandra mace  i was reading about this  i was thanking god  that my daughter wasnt the kind of a girl that was  would be mixed up in anything ugly like this  please daddy dont  i was even feeling sorry for the parents of the girls who were involved   please please  please  eighteen years old  you have to have an illegitimate child  taken away from you by some filthy doctor  mr mason  you get out of my house  i do want to see the rest of this but i get the idea   im her father  then behave as though you a  top 20 show prime time for pennies on the dollar  and its the perfect match for belle jolie lipstick  really how does that work  controversy means viewers  women will find a way to watch this  maybe just because they dont want to get left out  is that true  theres no doubt in my mind  we can talk to them about putting on a warning  research shows rules are made to be broken  thanks ken he has the research  this discussion its uncomfortable  this show is troubling  its catharsis  thats hard to come by  what is better than tears to make a girl  ready to hear she can be beautiful  id love to see a spike  but what do i do when hugh brody asks  what the hell this is  belle jolie is a family company  this is not wholesome  there are limits to what you can get out of daytime  i dont want belle jolie to be part of this debate  so you think girls who buy lipstick arent going to be interested in this  i dont care where they stand so its political  politics are in women will be watching  young women  im sorry  we thought you should know about it  i have to say im very impressed  you brought this to us  i wish we were a different kind of company  we all work for someone   it was a pleasure  pleasure   hows it going  very well thank you   you said you wanted to see me  yes i did   youre harry crane right  yes i am  certain things have come to my attention  no  i heard about it thirdhand and i thought  it sounded reckless so i talked to mr cooper  mr cooper knows about this  i think someone told on you and it backfired   mitch  doesnt matter  cooper thought it showed initiative  so youre in here now and im smiling  what do you want  i guess for one thing  i think that we should have a television department  all the other agencies have them and i think i should run it  youre now the head of the tv department  which is comprised solely of you anything else  well actually um  i think i deserve a raise  and i think  youve already received a sizable reward   lets not get greedy  im not being greedy  are you arguing with me   how much do you make  two hundred dollars a week  plus drinks  give me a number  how about 310  no one makes that around here not even close  how about two and a quarter say yes  yes  ill throw in new business cards you drive a hell of a bargain  we really enjoyed visiting but wed rather stay in a hotel  made my daughterinlaw happier  luckily were a long way from those problems  although i do love the idea of bobby and sally  having apartments and families  where is he  who  jimmy barrett  no hunt  i dont think that would be a good idea  edith please  he wants to apologize  oh dear  well he certainly picked a nice place  hello everybody  sorry were late but one of us likes to make an entrance   hello bobbie barrett  pleasure   weve met before  i remember  mr draper  this is my wife betty  betty this is bobbie and jimmy barrett  oh my i am such a fan  when you imagine someone saying that to you  you always hope its her  and this one my god are you two sold separately  look its jfk  and youre not jackie but youre definitely his type  ive met him  nice to see you again jimmy you remember hunt and edith schilling  how could i forget they bought me a car  a pleasure as always  and the little lady look at you all dolled up  what do you do sweetheart i want to know everything  im a housewife  i bet little birds hang up your laundry  and we have a little boy and a little girl  is that everything or you want to let my imagination run wild  by the way i loved you ingentlemans agreement  good evening mesdames and monsieurs  the chef has prepared many specialits   which i will have the pleasure of  just a minute monsieur le pew  any chance we can get a drink order filled  sorry everybody but jimmys down a quart  bobbie you want anything   dubonnet with a twist  bien sr  and make it fast while this place is still french   i hope you all like spit in your food  come on  i come here all the time  now i have a few key questions for mrs america  remember betsy everythings riding on this  so really what fills your days  eating bonbons  hitting tennis balls with the needy  actually i spend a lot of my time riding horses  its really a passion for me  and for them i bet  so big horses give me an education  you dont want to hear about this  no i do is it the beauty pageant thing where they walk in little bitty steps  ill be right back  no thats dressage  i knew that  its the same kind of sale but i do jumping  you two do any jumping  im sorry can you excuse me a moment  all this talk about horses huh  what are you expecting a chinese baby  i dont know what it is but one thing i know  is its not chinese  were both very proud of you  well good because a 121  raise is nothing to sneeze at  i dont care about the money well  the moneys nice  i just cant wait to go into the phone company tomorrow  and tell the girls that my husband is the head of television  at sterling cooper  do you feel well enough to go in because you dont have to  youre sweet  what did you do  well i took this tv show that no one wanted  to sponsor and i told one of our clients about it  and you sold it  no but everyone was impressed that i recognized the opportunity  whats the show  just some show  you wouldnt like it  you look great  do i   im not feeling great  why not  im going to be brief  because i dont like leaving him alone out there  theyre loving it  theyre being polite  the window for this apology is closing  it has to happen before the appetizers or they will leave  really  because i was thinking about that  so i took a look at jimmys contract  well me and a lawyer  and i realized jimmy doesnt have to apologize at all  in fact theyre going to have to pay him even if they fire him  especially because hurt feelings isnt a very good reason  so what is this all about  i think an apology and a public one like this one  has to be worth 25000  and i want it in the paper  say its a bonus  believe me  i will ruin him  do what i say   dont get up  i wasnt gonna  but this one knows about horses who knows  ive been spending the whole time watching her lips move  i hope we havent ordered yet because there really is something  that we need to get out of the way  hes picking up the check i mean theres really no debate is there  mr and mrs schilling jimmy has something that hed like to say to you  honestly id rather eat your chips than anything in this dump  they have snails here you know  thats nice to hear  mrs schilling  edith  i was out of line the other day i shouldnt have said it to you  and not just cause youre married to him  i shouldnt have said it to anybody not in that environment  sweetheart look at me  you too hunt  can i call you hunt  theres the guy under the lights and theres me  hes made me rich but he hasnt made me very nice  i hope we can put it behind us  i know thats what you do  i guess i just dont have the stomach for it  well im famished  excuse me  betts you all right  nothing  nothings wrong  im just so happy  when i said i wanted to be  a part of your life  this is what i meant  we make a great team
