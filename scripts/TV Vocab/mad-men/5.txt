                   previously on mad men  when i told you you had everything  i was wrong  im serious don dont talk to me about her  that makes me feel cruel  you always get what you want dont you  i got you  advertising really  work  i still dont understand what you do  draper who knows anything about that guy  no ones ever lifted that rock  dick  richard whipin  holy smokes is that you  well this will look good in your office  what take that thing on the train  like some kid who won at the four h  besides no one wants to look like they care about awards  but you do  isnt it sad  roger was very eloquent  he likes to be recognized for selling  creative is less important  creative helps sell  but he gave the speech  look at you in this tuxedo  say it for me  pleasure to meet you mrs draper  enchanted  its 8 oclock  shit  oh my lord  mommy  ethels downstairs  shes making us breakfast  sally mommy has a headache  whats that thing  daddys boss won an award  daddy won one too  an award for good horses  go downstairs and eat something  i think theres alkaseltzer in the kitchen  are you okay  just do it in the kitchen i dont want to hear the bubbles   congratulations mr draper  thank you  i hear advertising age ran a picture  fortunately no one reads that  thats really amazing  ill get mr campbell and mr kinsey  they wanted you to know they were waiting but they left  thats rude  they said something about the new key award going to your head   congratulations by the way  thank you   congratulations to you too  thank you peggy  congratulations for what  being the only one on time for this meeting  i was just telling peggy i got a short story published  good for you  with the atlantic monthly  look at that  congratulations  thank you  what does this have to do with you kenny  tapping a maple on a cold vermont morning  cosgrove here got a story published in the  the atlantic monthly  youre kidding  i look forward to reading it  keep it ive got copies  congrats indeed  a thing like that  youre a writer you write  yes the weird thing is short fiction is not my strong suit  i have two novels  novels about what  one is about a roughneck on an oil rig  who has to move to manhattan because  his wifes mother is sick  the other one is well  a woman whos a widow  she kind of got stuck with this family farm  no one will help her except this boy  those dont even sound stupid  thanks  i mean they both sound good  want to read one  i do but i also want to talk about liberty capital savings  right  talk one of you  as you know jack carney says they want a new promotion  interest rates are level  some kind of irresistible fireworks  that bring people to the bank even if its just to visit  i hate it when they say fireworks  especially when they keep talking about a toaster  with a warming tray on top or a blender  a blenders nice  jack keeps talking about escalating the toaster awards  in order to lure women in  which is silly when you think about it  because other than a few working girls  most women arent in charge of the banking  not in my house  they visit the bank  they do  all we do is try to get the girls in  families  but you know what  men need their own accounts  beyond the family  men  i can see that discretion discretionary  statements sent to the office  yes  liberty capital private account  no  executive account  thats why he won an award  the accounts won the award  i have a call for you from vics biterbeck  hello mr biterbeck  its me and dont ask who or youll spoil the mood  whos vics  the trumpeter  i was thinking about playing the horn this afternoon  where are you calling me from  i just had a phone put in  really instant connection  just like that night at the ticket booth  in grand central  midge im at work  just get down here  i want you to pull my hair and ravish me  and leave me for dead  ill be back after lunch  kenneth cosgrove i think im gonna vomit  who in the hell is ken cosgrove  hes from burlington vermont his father is a salesman  what the hell does that have to do with it  i cant believe he got published  and didnt tell anyone until it came out  he kept walking around like the idiot he is  i have this story about this crazy night i had  where i ended up in jersey city with all these negroes  and we all got along  can you imagine how good that story is  no  it is  its a national magazine  that hurts too  that was it  thats what i called for  you can go  you cant call me at work  youre scared im gonna get lonely all the time  start having conversations with you  and ring you all the time saying  when are you gonna come over  this is working right now  and it worked today  look im sorry your life is in a million pieces  itd be easier for you to have one less  i hurt your feelings  you didnt like my call a little bit  im here  and you waited until you were done  to make me feel bad about the phone call  i like that you come in here  acting like somebody else  must be so intense above 14th street  and you shoot down on the train  that look when i open that door  sometimes youre preoccupied but then you always  well you always  change gears  i dont even think about it  i know  i like being your medicine  okay  whats wrong with it  just tell me i can tell you dont like it  i do  and i love that youre sitting alone at your typewriter  drinking a scotch thinking it up  but you dont like it  i mostly read the classics  it seemed strange to me its too modern  really  thats kind of a compliment  but i dont think you mean it that way  i just think its odd that the bear is talking  the bear is not talking  its what the hunter imagines the bear to be thinking  is well written why dont you submit it  i was going to when i finish dickering with it  you can run it by charlie fittich  he has one of those big publishing jobs doesnt he  your friend laura kept saying how he makes things happen there   why would i do that  because he can help us  call him ask him to look at the story  why now  do you know who ken cosgrove is  hes an account executive just like me  did you know that  my father reads the damn atlantic  so what  you dont want to be a writer  i thought it was a hobby  hes out there people know who he is  pumpkin  charlie fittich  im surprised  you can tell what this means to me  you said youd do anything for me  i dont understand you  you were so upset when i told you  told me about what  peter  told me about what  that he was my first  well  this  helps make up for that  let charlie fittich  see what hes been missing  okay   morning  good morning  traffic meeting is starting in the conference room  really  cosgrove im serious i think it shows tremendous fortitude  and id like to see more of it around here  people finishing things  i guarantee that in the bottom drawer  of every desk in this place is the first ten pages of a novel  but  the story itself was not much to my liking  but i think it showed an uncanny understanding  of what most people like  i guess so  whatd you get paid for that 100 bucks  about that  ought to keep you working here  so miss holloway would you like to take the reins  lets start with maytag mr cosgrove  you want to complain about the copy now that youre a big writer  production needs 50 percent up front  and were waiting on a check  and when will you be calling the client about that  i spoke with them last week and  ill check with them again this afternoon  arent you good  rio de janeiro  the double page spread we ran in life  and town and country was so successful  they want to resize the ad to run in readers digest   big ad  little magazine  sals problem  lucky strike  sales are great lawsuit is pending  youre the one whos supposed to keep an eye out   on whats happening in

 well have to do that on the way  they must be waiting for us at the studio come on  nice to meet you  dont worry about that  thank you  theyre terrible  no theyre not  don was late it ruined the whole thing  carletons always late  you can see whats important to them  we are very important to them stop it  howd you like to be in helen bishops family portrait  theres a big hole there believe me  i want to take them again anyway  sally looks fat  i dont think so  the worst part is don will think theyre fine  here maybe this one  blow that one up  it will hold you until the christmas card  the color is off on these too  am i wrong  i really expect the royal treatment when i go to dons office  and i seldom get it  its like walking into another country  where i dont speak the language  at carletons i feel like im stupid  all that manhattan talk  our husbands  theyre our better out here arent they  infinitely  we took your idea of product and applied it directly to the bank  banking products not household products  you said banking products werent sexy  we went down some really dumb roads like  bank accounts for children  and then don here had this  roaming candle of an idea don  i think paul has a handle on this  the modern executive is a busy man  he leads a complicated life  he has business expenses  family leisure  how are you supposed to keep all that straight  well now liberty capital  is gonna help you with that  what is this  an account for a man that is private  the statements come to the office not your home  i see for organizing your life  if it needs it  liberty for the libertine  thats good  does this say that to you  it will if you put the word private in there  instead of liberty executive private account  what are you laughing at  a portion of our customers are already  i believe doing this  theres just no name for it  and we had no way to charge them  i like the torch it says dont get burned  it could start some uncomfortable conversations  in a lot of homes but  its better than a calendar  lets talk placement  hello  i opened everything but that one  one is about a roughneck on an oil rig  who has to move to manhattan  because his wifes mothers sick  the other is about  you know i just finished reading it  its really a great story  thank you that means a lot  its nice to see someones passion be  rewarded  you know what  i dont have a copy of it  and i wanted to give it  to my girlfriend  you said you got like 50 more copies right  maybe i do  if not its on every newsstand in town  good to hear  youre leaving  yes for the day  okay  im going home you can reach me there if necessary  i always wondered why hes ignored me  probably cause hes so good looking  he can go outside the office for whatever he wants  most of these fellows cant  he seemed different to me  well either way you have to do your job  keep his record clean here and at home  honestly if he sees that in you you are a solid gold  thats my job  yes  thats his private life private  thats how these men are and its why we love them   i dont love him  fine  look if youre even thinking about  passing judgement then youre in the wrong business   okay  you need to relax  i have never come over here  and not seen you with a look on your face that said i need a drink  this job is odd  but its the best  listen kenny   what  listen  i know ive been a bear  but ive been competing neck and neck  with people in this place  i didnt know i was competing with you too  you lost  hello sweetheart  hello dear  well i have some good news  charlie fittich came by the house this afternoon  did he here  i guess your lunch did go well  wasnt lunch i told you that  so what did he say dont tease me  he said he was going to get you published  that is incredibly swell news  when where  boys life magazine  what  its a 40 fee and a lot of people read it  are you kidding me boys life  that story was good enough for the new yorker  and dont act like those magazines do everything on merit  i thought youd be happy  for a years work  you dont want me to have what i want  youre going to be published  boys life  probably next to some ad for exploding cigars  i could of gotten you in the new yorker  or in the encyclopedia brittanica if i wanted to  so why didnt you  why would you do that to me  why would you put me in that position  i talked to my father about the house in cape may  he said our dates are good august wont be a problem  thats good  i wish it wasnt so far from the city  then wed see more of you  its not that far  and i hate you spending august in the office  although i liked your girl peggy shes fresh  as the driven snow  you sound disappointed  did you read some terrible article in look magazine  that i should know about  i like her  a woman cant just not remark on her husbands secretary  don are you okay  no i just might have to go back to the office i havent decided yet  phone  hello  i need to see you tonight are you busy  for you of course not  good im leaving now  from where   i dont even know what you drink  whatever you have  im so glad you changed your mind  come in  sit down  i know its terrible its temporary i hope  look at you  you look more like you now  i came here because i wanted to talk to you  and explain something to you  yeah you gotta stop that kind of talk  this isnt so hard  adam listen to me  i have a life  and it only goes in one direction forward  what are you drinking gin  i found it in one of the offices under a couch  three quarts figured i could take one  coffee  i can do that  so no abigail no uncle mac nobody huh  i know its strange  your office is really nice  i figure from that award you must be pretty important  i dont know i guess so  everyone always said you were too smart for your own good  of course uncle mac thought you were soft  but youre not are ya  no im not  what are you doing  its 5000  thats all there is  i want you to take it  and i want you to leave new york  and i dont want to see or hear from you ever again  thats not what i wanted  thats not right  thats all i can do for you  youre serious arent you  you thought i was dead  just go back to thinking that

great  im looking forward to it already i swear  but i know you dont like that my father might be there for part of it  i just dont like the way he looks at me  you took away his little girl  i was  thinking  maybe we should just buy a summer house  something closer thats ours  i mean i know we had a good year  i dont know bets  i think cape may will be fine  were not that flush right now  theres nothing to be worried about  id just rather wait til next year  good  because i like seeing my dad
