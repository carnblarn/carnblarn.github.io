doingmy own research if youre planning to continue withmedical testimony youll only be invitingfurther government interference we must police ourselves  theres your slogan the medical thing is dead  we understand that yes dead an apt choice of wordsconsidering the public is convincedthat cigarettes are poisonous if we cant insist that theyre not i believe my most recent surveyshave provided a solution we can still suggest that cigarettesare part of american life or too good to give up or most appealingan assertion of independence so basically if you love dangeryoull love smoking we can put a skulland crossbones on the label i love it before the warwhen i studied with adler in viennawe postulated that what freud calledthe death wish is as powerful a driveas those for sexual reproductionand physical sustenance freud you say what agency is he with were supposedto believe that people are allliving one way and secretly thinkingthe exact opposite thats ridiculous let me tell you somethingmiss guttman doctor dr guttman psychology might be greatat cocktail parties but it so happens that peoplewere buying cigarettes before freud was born the issue here isntwhy should people smoke its why should peoplesmoke lucky strike suggestingthat our customers have a what did you call it a death wish i just dont see thaton a billboard so what ifreaders digestsays theyre dangerous they also saidbambiwasthe book of the century theres no proof theres conclusive proofthat none of these lowtar lownicotineor filtration systems have any effecton the incidences of lung cancer just

years old we share a wallwith tiffanys honestly a coupon miss menken coupons work i think your father wouldagree with the strategy he might but hes not here becausewe just had our lowest sales year

cigarette we do itand then suddenly thats not good enough might as well beliving in russia mm damn straight you know this morningi got a call from my competitorsat brown  williamson and theyre getting suedby the federal government because of the health claims they made yeah were aware of that mr garner but you have to realize that throughthe manipulation of the mass media the public is under the impressionthat your cigarettes are linked to certain fatal diseases manipulation of the media hellthats what i pay you for our product is fine i smoke em myself my granddad smoked em he died at 95 years old he was hit by a truck i understandbut our hands are tied were no longer allowed to advertisethat lucky strikes are safe what the hellare we gonna do weve already fundedour own tobacco research centerto put this whole rumor to rest and thatsa very good start but it may notaffect sales don i think maybethats your cue well uh i have been uh thinking quite a bitabout this and uh i mean you know im alucky strike man from way back so i might have a solution at sterling cooperweve been pioneering the burgeoning fieldof research and our analysis showsthat the health risks associated with your productis not the end of the world people get in their carsevery day to go to work and some of them die cars are dangerous theres nothingyou can do about it you still have to getwhere youre going cigarettes are exactly the same so why dont we simply say so what if cigarettes are dangerous youre a man the world is dangerous smoke your cigarette you still have to getwhere youre going  thats very interesting i mean if cigaretteswere dangerous  it would be interesting except they arent thats your slogan youre going to die anywaydie with us actually its a fairly wellestablished psychological principlethat society has a death wish and if we couldjust tap into that the market potential is what the hell are youtalking about are you insane im notselling rifles here im in the tobaccobusiness were selling america the indian gave it to us for shit sake come on dad lets get out of here the bright spot isat least we know if wehave this problem everybodyhas this problem gentlemen before you leavecan i just say something i dont know don can you the federal trade commissionand readers digest have done you a favor theyve let you know that any adthat brings up the concept of cigarettes and health together well its just gonnamake people think of cancer yes and weregrateful to them but what lee jrsaid is right if you cant makethose health claims neithercan your competitors so weve gota lot of people not saying anythingthat sells cigarettes not exactly this is the greatestadvertising opportunity since the inventionof cereal we have six identical companiesmaking six identical products we can say anything we want how do youmake your cigarettes i dont know shame on you we breed insectrepellenttobacco seeds plant them inthe north carolina
