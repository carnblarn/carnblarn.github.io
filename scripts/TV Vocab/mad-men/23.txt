the worst thing   excuse me  i hate my mother  what do you think of that  come on you must have an opinion  i dont know the circumstances  i dont know what i should expect from her   i dont know her  like bud and i turned out so great  whos to say it wouldnt be better  so its not yours that could be good  i dont know what youre talking about  but i think your flight will be fine  you should go

happened  i didnt know if i was going to see you again  and then you werent even home  did you run away  so  i think you should tell me what happened  my dad wants charlotte and me to live with him  my mom doesnt care  im sure thats not true  she just wants to be with her boyfriends  does she have a lot of boyfriends  i guess  they give me things  i havent seen you in so long  except driving down the street  i know i know  can i use the bathroom  do you want me to wash your clothes  is that shirt okay  that almost fits you  go ahead  why are you alone here  its the middle of the day  its lousy  you understand why your mother was mad at me i hope  because she doesnt understand  thats true  im not going home  because i know im a problem for them  i know i am because they keep saying im not  did you do something  no but my mom is never home  my dad has another baby  his wife is pretty mean  wheres your mother  i dont know  writing pamphlets and handing them out  im pretty responsible  i brush my sisters teeth and put us both to bed  thats very sweet of you  arent you going to eat  can i tell you something  of course  i dont like ham  i dont like meat at all actually  im sorry do you

controls  go ahead its okay  whats he doing here  glen can you come in here  glen get over here now  i was worried sick  glen you have to go home  you cant do things like this  lets go your fathers on his way  i hate you   apologize right this minute  no its true  i hate you  i know  im sorry  come on lets wash up for dinner  advertising if anything helps bring on change  the market and im talking in a purely marxist sense  dictates that we must include everyone  the consumer has no color  betty im sorry but we really need to talk  theres nothing to talk about  i dont know why he was over here  but this has to stop  nothings going on  except that glen feels alone  honestly i dont blame him  what did he say  nothing  but its obvious  he depends on you for everything  youre supposed to be taking care of him  youre his mother  and he gets nothing  i thought with dan out of our lives it would be different  glens right  im not a very good mother anymore  don isnt living here  im sorry  we havent told the children  is it over  i i dont even know  thats the worst  do they see him  he takes them to dinner  they dont know what made them so special all of the sudden  i dont know  for me it wasnt that different without him there  sometimes i feel like ill float away  if don isnt holding me down  the hardest part  is realizing youre in charge  as you can see  the pilot has turned off the no smoking sign  were expecting clear skies en route to los angeles today  it should be a pleasant day  82 degrees and clear with a light santa ana wind
