all gonna join you  youre wrong  look dons not one to stand on ceremony  hes not gonna care  i made it i knew draper would be late  i have some crackers in my desk  so burning the midnight oil  sall right  hope the words are good cause he aint got any artwork  you didnt have time to give it to art you want to start living here  im supposed to be at the pen and pencil by 1230 every day i was promised  look freddie the eating is the thing im sure you can have a drink  its an unspoken agreement  i got you freddie  are these all the glasses peggy  i dont know we have artwork  peggy go see if we can expect don today  thats a good idea drapers not going to yell at her  you want to be alone with that  im telling you draper knocked her up  she goes away for a couple of months drops about 9 pounds 8 ounces  comes back with a job  dons been screwing me for the last three years  ive got nothing  whats everybody laughing at  oh the great debate wages on about peggy olsens charmed career  fat farm  i thought we had verification  do you have any idea when youll be expecting mr draper  um i was expecting him at the beginning of work today  but then he called and said hed be late  he said he was going to the movies pinocchio  thank you  are you insinuating something  i wasnt doing anything i dont think  well i believe that  i want you to imagine when you talk about mr draper  that hes standing right behind you  and think about that whenever you speak of him   are you going to tell on me  i didnt know what did i do   do you know where mr draper is  no i dont i think he was joking  lois  do you know where mr draper is  hes out  thank you lois  how is it  he wrote some of it here  some of it on 23rd street some place they tore down  makes you feel better about sitting in a bar at lunch  makes you feel like youre getting something done  its all about getting things done  is it good  i dont think youd like it  you wanted to see me  i wanted to see that valentine heart  on my way out anything else  im taking mona to lutce   let me hear what the living are up to  you love her   what happened to the jewish doctor  hes not jewish  not anymore but he was trust me is he still a doctor  you sound like a little girl what do you care  i wish you every happiness  im well aware this is vicarious i already said that  i already know what day hes going to ask me  huh does he know that  because i have a feeling theres a penalty for passing that date  he knows  mr phillips here to see you  send him in  joan   did you girls get my candy  yes it was appreciated  and yet unappreciated  anything else  no thank you thatll be all  got a second  nothing good ever started with that sentence  its not that its martinsons coffee  im excited about the possibility of that happening  and as you recall martinsons coffee has a unique problem  good we like that  well thats just it  no one under   they pour it on their frosted flakes  for those who think young  which is why i was disappointed to see don put fred rumsen on this  so freddie doesnt drink coffee  he doesnt wear a bra either he managed to do a good job on playtex  its frustrating not to have young people around here  were a young country the president has a baby  have you been out there its rotten with kids  and the cologne they wear  real kids 25 even less  maybe one of those teams the writer and the artist together  clients keep bringing it up  talk to don about it just for martinsons coffee alone  cant you talk to don about it  i thought this was the way things were done here  didnt you tell me you were a bridge between accounts and don  doesnt sound like me  look don has talent  you know how to deal with that dont you  just assume that he knows as much about business as you do  but inside theres a child who likes getting his way  hes not my first creative director  this is about a sales reality and not personal territory  its what the clients are asking for and we need to have it  whats the best way to make it happen   mr draper  any calls  yes and there was your 1200 in the conference room  of course  well girls can say whatever they want they want the chocolates  right peggy   of course they do  i dont do anything   keeps em off balance  hey chief  sorry were late  i think the little ones need to eat  what do we have dale wake up  i could just go  or kinsey  you want to go first  peggy  i just wrote copy for dale  well this is kind of the gist because i was  well we were  it just kept changing course  mohawk airlines theres a new chief in the sky  and i thought following that  most routes to boston circle the wagons weve got it surrounded  and thered be wagons around a dot that says boston  i can almost picture it sal  its the first time im hearing it too  so its about an airline thats flown by indians  maybe a plane with some arrows stuck in the cargo door thats funny  thats what gets peoples attention now right  there has to be advertising for people who dont have a sense of humor   i understand  what else you got  several more indian puns  stop writing for other writers  luxury service  a lot of people are afraid of turbulence   so its dead calm  look how level those drinks are  wherever mohawk takes us   or youll love getting there  whats outside that window   fluffy clouds  research  i get on a plane i dont care where im going  i just want to see the city disappearing behind me  so we could take the clouds out of there and put in a city  the chrysler building  that indian  its not about the majestic beauty of the mohawk nation  its about adventure  could be a pirate  could be a knight in shining armor it could be  a conquistador getting off of a boat  its about a fantastical people who  are taking you someplace where youve never been  blah blah blah blah  we could dress the stew as pocahontas  with the cheekbones  hows his wife going to feel about that  air travels too expensive to waste on your wife  you want to get on a plane to feel alive you want to get on a plane  to see just the hint of a womans thigh because her skirt is just  is just this much too short  friday  tomorrow  what does that mean  it means you want to go somewhere go up her skirt  thats the impression i got  karla bobbys turning blue out there  did somebody get a lot of valentines  they made everybody give one to everybody else  that defeats the purpose  they had a party  i see fruit punch   im making this for daddy  thats beautiful  ill see that he gets it   mommy can i do it  okay  i want to go riding with you   you cant  well why  well for one thing its too dangerous  no its not  do you rember what happened to the little girl in gone with the wind  you are taking a bath tonight  they say once you start drinking alone youre an alcoholic  im really trying to avoid that  so i guess im helping both of us  cooper wants younger people   for what purpose  martinsons coffee  last time freddie rumsen had a cup of coffee  it was one of five being poured down his throat by a cop  well young campaigns dont necessarily come from young people  the clients like it  the clients like the thrill of young talent  so what am i supposed to do  dangle a pepsi out the window and see if i can hook a stroller  i have some candidates   this smells like accounts to me  i had paul kinsey make up a list  he had no idea he was signing his own death warrant   you want younger people than that  what do you want me to say  tell duck  clients dont understand  their success is related to standing out not fitting in  its a fad  paint him a picture uh something like  one wants to be the needle in the haystack   not a haystack  donald  isnt it possible that the recently weaned have some unique perspective  joy enthusiasm  youre talking as if theyre some fresh version of us theyre not  young people dont know anything  especially that theyre young  huh  well let me set this in a more appealing context for you  prove him wrong  happy valentines day   i love this place  i know   so what are we doing  dont worry  we will be out of here before the singer starts  juanita  betsy hofstadt  look at you  this is so nice don believe it or not you two have met  i dont think we have bets don draper   a pleasure to meet you  a pleasure  juanita was one of my roommates when i lived on the west side   we were models together  in that horrible apartment   do you live in the city  well i do curtis is from detroit  automobiles  how are you  um i work as a decorator  how exciting  i have a little girl and boy  of course you do  it looks like everythings going well  my god that stone  oh that was a gift  well give me your phone number tell me how i can reach you  does anyone have a business card  i do  i would love a nice long lunch  so nice to see

stupid do you think i am  juanita carson  should i get another one here what are we doing  how does room service sound  oh don  i came prepared  i suppose people get lonely  and its valentines day  be mine for 100  how much is it do you think  i told her i wanted to have hundreds of babies with you  hello lovely  happy valentines   thats so sweet  i got your little note  well hildy did  be careful about just putting things in my bag  come on open them i want one  the round ones are conut  shouldve got the kind where they put that chart in the box  i spoke with jennifer crane  shes expecting  thats impossible carey didnt tell me anything  thats because he doesnt know shes going to surprise him tonight  i just got so distracted  dinners not for an hour  im through with my past love tweety  theres no reason thats bad for us  i saw this dumpy woman on second avenue by the hungarian market  and she had her daughter pushing a stroller with a little boy in it  and she was round  she was expecting another  she was just  buying fruit like it was any other day  the daughter was pregnant  the mother  its this big club theyre all in together  even her  well  rest assured  she doesnt have what you have  jennifer crane does  do you really believe that  i guess not  hold on  whats wrong  don its okay  weve got all night  i wish youd just tell me what to do  we drank too much you know i dont even know where i am  you should eat something  hello yes this is mr draper in uh  room 804  yes can you send up some uh  some vichyssoise and a blt on white toast  no shrimp cocktail two of them  scratch that two shrimp cocktails please  wait a minute  hello  yeah do you have anything special anything out of season   so when you find a room like this  this piano was designed by franklin roosevelt  oh leave that  how about this i want a half  avocado filled with crabmeat and a rare bft filet  two place settings  and if its an american company that you can help i like to do that  if its not just as long as its the best  i rather love this hall  it has all the colors one thinks of when one thinks of the white house  red and white and blue and gold  its through this door that all the heads of state come  and this is where the president meets them  and here is where the marine band plays  they have ruffles and flourishes  and hail to the chief  and then theres a receiving line  and then everyone goes in to dinner here in the state dining room  wheres her husband  even now its not set up for that many   are there many state dinners  yes there are  uh there were almost two a month last year  this rooms interesting  because it has the most architectural unity of any room in the white house  its really all 1902  when theodore roosevelt did the great resoration  with mckim mead and white  which of these pieces have historical associations  oh there are quite a few  you have to see this  thats nellie custissofa  no i dont   george washingtons granddaughter i feel so strongly  that the white house should have this fine a collection  its so important the setting in  which the presidency is presented to the world   what do you think it is  i dont know  but im going to find out  and now a word from our sponsor  their armoire  ive seen them in connecticut  but theyre copies you know jackie has a real one  in the white house i think so  she seemed nervous  even when she saw jack at the end its like they were playing house  thats chocolate ice cream or blood  i couldnt throw it away  its french  well call it chocolate ice cream and ill work on it  well im sorry we missed it no time for television  stop rubbing it in  really a room at the savoy that takes thought  your night sounded very romantic  i would describe it as delightfully disappointing  there was a time when he overdid it but ill take dull and know where i stand  i agree  what  i ran into this old friend juanita carson  we were models together roommates  she was in the lounge of the savoy she didnt look cheap  except for this 2 carat stone  but she wasnt with a date  she was with a companion  i dont understand  don agreed with me he was an old man  shes a call girl  really  butterfield 8   i wonder what thats like  i dont know  new york manhattan is expensive we forget that  i used to look at people in restaurants with envy  don gave me a fur coat  if prostitution is don showing up with a fur coat sign me up  i dont think its like that  i just keep picturing juanita at 22 years old  we shared a room  talked in the dark  i know we wanted the same things  when i was 22 whenever i was really low on money  i would call my father and let him know that i was going to havana  and he would without fail  send 25 in cash in the mail  he wanted you to have a good time  no hes a degenerate gambler  and it would always come with a list of instructions of how to bet it   youre kidding me  no and he never won  because i never went  thats criminal  whats wrong with the conference room  why dont we go to my office plenty of room  braggart  nope were sitting here  im trying to figure something out  so pops we should celebrate your soontobefat wife  arent you happy  well sure i mean its gonna be a lot of headaches  things are gonna change but come on  hes really meeting with them  why are they doing this  i guess you havent been privy to some of ducks scoutmaster  talks about how we need younger creative  who said that did he say that  a few times  wonderful  look were in the same boat im sure hell turn his sights on us  no ones been promoted in accounts since he came in  i cant believe donald would listen to duck   well maybe duck made him  nobody makes draper do anything  let me tell you don draper has a rope coiled under his desk  and its looped around ducks neck  and ducks gonna run around and run around and then one day  theres a meeting nobody told me there was a meeting  can we change venues  so  you have a lot of thoughts  how old are you   but that resume thats really just two years 18 months without a doubt  right youre experienced i gather  are you married  thats uh why were on the the purpose  hes right we havent settled down yet  so again you both did everything  together and yet you get paid more  well i have a writing background short fiction and im a citizen  but you contribute words  uh only when its a distance  im gonna ask you a question  that was always asked of me when i was on job interviews  that is divine man  have you ever been fired  i believe you that other people have them in the hallways  i just dont know if thats right for us  i mean this is an environment for clients  we dont want to appear to be bursting at the seams  uh lois  may i speak with you  theresa said there was an incident yesterday  you were crying in the break room which i have specifically forbidden   im sorry but peggy  miss olsen  she yelled at me  why would she do that  im good at my job  the next time that you come to complain  i wasnt complaining you wanted to talk to me  this is why i dont allow crying in the break room it erodes morale  theres a place to do that like your apartment  it came over me  and i would correct your attitude towards miss olsen   its unbecoming  yes joan  do we like this in the hallway  i think it looks good now but i think it will become messy  i agree  looks good  by the way it has julian koenigs fingerprints all over it  his masters voice also not mine   pleasure to meet you mr smith  smitty kurt  we have the same last name we dont want people to mix us up  must happen all the time you two share an office  works best that way  look at this gentlemen your reputations precede you  duck phillips head of account services  i get a distinct impression   pardon  wed  rather people not know we were here  if it gets out were meeting   of course not  yes right  goodbye   ill let him know she called  okay  i like the direction youre taking  good  so now that ive given you your babies and your xerox machine  should i throw in a couple of elephants  i dont want there to be any excuse when you cant bring in martinsons coffee  dont get worked up  you know there are other ways to think of things  than the way you think of them  the testimonials i was thinking we could get younger girls  sixth graders it would mean different publications   do they need clearasil that early  doesnt matter  doesnt  i guess we could try that  two more from dvb  even younger  just assume that everyone on the list you handed roger is coming in  youre an idiot   i dont understand that im only 22  you dont count  weve got to get him out of here come on daddy  how often do you get to celebrate getting some girl pregnant  campbell youre buying  we still have to show mohawk to mr draper   dales not

obvious  im uninvolved  what about that   i think its sentimental  peggy  no shes right  just because it has sentiment doesnt make it sentimental  were talking about businessmen  right businessmen who like short skirts  sex sells  says who  just so you know the people who talk that way think that  monkeys can do this  and they take all this monkey crap and just stick it in a briefcase  completely unaware  that their success depends on something more than their shoe shine  you are the product  you feeling something  thats what sells  not them  not sex  they cant do what we do  and they hate us for it  welcome back daddy  is that a question  what did you bring me daddy  you can put that in your book  what is going on  hes gonna take it to leon in actuarial  his stomachs so fat its now

trees  snows and skies of laughter are always diminishing  less funny not just darker  not just gray  it may be the coldest day of the year  what does he think of that  i mean  what do i  and if i do  perhaps i am myself again
