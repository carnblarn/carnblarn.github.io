                previously on mad men   do you miss london  god yes  i dont know what i did to get under your skin  i have been watching my life  scratching and im trying to get into it  im very sorry   i started this  i dont know what you want     so what  so i cant stop thinking about you     mad men s03e10   butter   and the apples are good now  but not from the market  i can go to rodney farms on sunday  its near church   cant we go to rodney farms  well see  why dont we go to church   we go to church  on christmas carla goes every sunday  we dont need to go every week   anything else  its early   do you want a drink  yes   how was school today  good   how come you never ask me  i do  its just your answer is always longer so i thought id start with sally   whens halloween  before thanksgiving  francine and carlton have invited us but  i think if were going to be selling daddys house i dont know  it might be nice to have it there one last time  are you going to sleep here tonight  no  youre working too much   betts i dont have a choice  no thats not what i mean i just  i see how hard youre working  hello  inside  were you grading papers  why  i dont know if youre hungry  but i made date nut bread  actually i made three  a bake sale  oh your service called mr hilton was looking for you  but hes probably in the air  right now  thanks miss farrell  thats good to know  i thought so  i want you to spend the whole night   you couldnt possibly  be asleep already  this eightyearold charlie  looked up at me  during art today and said  how do i know if what i see  as blue is the same  as it is to you  and what did you say  the truth  i dont know  i never have  but i love that he made me  think about that again  what would you have said  i would have told charlie  that my job is about  boiling down communication  to its essentials  and that i know  that there is a blue  that at least 45 of the population  sees as the same  maybe half those people think  theyre looking at yellow  maybe  but the truth is people may see  things differently  but they dont really want to  do you feel bad about what you do  nobody feels as good about  what they do as you do  oh thats sweet  i wish i couldve known you at eight  i bet you were serious  i wouldve liked you  long curly hair  no one has it anymore   why dont you take her  because i said no  youd rather not go than with me  what do you think mr draper would say if you showed up at  the sterling cooper 40th with his secretary  good morning mr draper  coffee   morning don  morning fellas yes   aqua net 900  get peggy  don if you could stand over there  its paul kinsey theater  this was my thought  aqua net is about hold  but it is also about beauty  so were driving  two couples i call it double date  the woman in the backs scarf blows off and her hair starts blowing   her hairdo falls apart  oh no  and then the woman in front takes off her scarf  and hands it back to the woman in the back   take mine  and he says are you sure marcia  marcias hair is perfect  and then her date gives her  a knowing smile of admiration  on her confident smile  aqua net arrive in style  too much story  every time i hear and then theres another chance for the ladies at home to misunderstand  what if its just the two couples  the wind is blowing  the woman in the back has to put on  her kerchief and she just looks longingly  at miss perfect in front  arrive in style still works  and at the end you can see the can  with the kerchief  like a seethrough one over it  and the wind blows it off  to reveal the aqua net  a kerchief in a can  dont use that  but very nice  well great then  what do you have for western union  we dont meet until next week  hilton takes precedence so i need you two  to be ready

party  all is well although as of late bert cooper will be in absentia   well that wont do  were flying across the pond we expect all the flowers in the vase   what does that mean look lane  weve had interest in the company for some months  and this party is essential to attracting a second suitor  for what purpose  did we reach you at a bad time  you seem foggy   saint john here  oh hello  lane sterling cooper is for sale  but why  weve reduced the staff and increased the revenue by 22  i think youve answered your own question  we need this party to encourage interest   do your best lad  yes

 it has come to my attention that  youre not attending the  sterling cooper 40th anniversary  i wouldnt have told roger if i planned on it remaining a secret  in great britain  we have a good deal  of testimonials and the senior  members are all equally unenthused  it marks the passage of time  its painful i imagine  i didnt get to where i am by dwelling on the past  so think of the future hmm  all of our clients all of our staff  the press newspapers and trade publications  enjoy the fruit of your longevity  you really pour the honey on then you lick it off  well if you care about sterling

when i come to   with piss in my pants  they stare at me like im from another planet  i am afflicted okay  its not a question of will i cant change that  do you need money  always  i swore to myself i

glamorous  elegant stunning betty draper  i want to show you off betts  okay  are you ready dons expecting us  ive got nothing  what a relief  mines garbage too  no i had something   something incredible but i lost it  i didnt write it down  i hate that  it mightve been the best idea i ever had  i did everything i talked to achilles  i spent last night recreating every detail of the evening hoping it would  come back you know how it is there was nothing  then there was it and now its nothing again  im so sorry  how do you talk to achilles  he is a janitor  with a very bad memory   you know what the chinese say  the faintest ink is better than the best memory  come on weve failed before  okay we really looked for advantages  one of them is phone calls happen every day  a telegrams a big deal  something like  shes getting married  are you really just going to give her a call  sounds like you are talking to her parents  they should really be at the wedding   also old people love them  when you care send one there  thats a slogan not an idea paul   mine arent any better  damn it kinsey whats your excuse   dont yell at him  excuse me   tell him what happened   no  the dog ate my homework i had a great idea and i lost it  i didnt write it down  i hate when that happens  i keep thinking about that chinese thing you said what was it  the faintest ink is better than the best memory  just makes me think  you call someone on the phone  hello im getting married congratulations on the baby and  then you hang up  its gone  its different if you send a telegram  telegram is permanent  something like  a telegram is forever  you cant frame a phone call  my god  thats the way to go you keep working on that  when do you want it  partys tonight  monday  see  it all works out  betts are you ready   the car is downstairs  the driver is chinese  ready betts  look how pretty mommy is  where are we going  to waldorf astoria mommy  then we passed it its on 5th avenue  it moved years ago  thats right thats right  why did they ever do that  enjoy the world as it is margaret  theyll change it  and never give you a reason  mommy she is not margaret she is jane she is my wife   does mona know  yes she knows  you seem surprised that theres traffic  theres always traffic  calm yourself well arrive on time  they are selling the company  what  they are selling sterling and cooper   when  i have no idea  what happenned to the americans  theyll go to the highest bidder  i know you hate uncertainity  but it complements the fact that we are returning to england  im gonna keep going on  and make don draper wait because god knows weve all waited for him  as if being  decorated for his services in korea were not enough  his career has yielded even more awards  the american association of  advertising agencys arthur kudner award  printers ink magazines advertising gold medal  the advertising writers association of new york  im not reading all these  he is loyal charming  quiet but not modest  why should he be  we have to thank his beautiful wife betty  and his three children for sharing him with us  because as we all know sometimes sterling cooper has gotten a large share  bert cooper  and my father roger sterling senior  bravely set this in motion  now let me introduce the man who will stand alongside me for the next 40 years  our creative director partner  father husband and friend  don draper  please  please  please  im very honored  by crazymaggot  marpessa
