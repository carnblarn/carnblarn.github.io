coffee hilton  of course  mr draper usually brings this in  he left early   can we go outside now  its raining go upstairs  i did not sleep last night  go take a nap ill shop in the afternoon    it could either be the view of the acropolis  or just these big columns like youre standing there  then below it your window on the world  hilton period  that window looks as old to me as those columns  did anybody look at a picture of the athens hilton  sliding doors dont read as windows  and believe it or not were not allowed to pretend that  thats the view from the window of the hilton because its not  other than that  the tag is flat  well that ones yours  that doesnt make it good if its bad dont use it   what else  uh  there are 16 graphically perfect reduced photographs of hilton hotels all on a grid  a simple headline  you go well meet you anywhere  now that i can finally understand you  i am less impressed with what you have to say  thats your work too   who is we  we are hilton  and

day and night  and im a harsh critic especially of myself  and sometimes it collects and i feel bad  and then i realize  maybe thats the reason im so lonesome  you might be working too much  im not working enough  its my purpose in life to bring america to the world  whether they like it or not  you know we are a force of good don  because we have god  the communists dont  its their most important belief did you know that  im not an expert  generosity  the marshall plan you remember that  everyone who saw our ways wanted to be us  im glad youre telling me this  after all the things we threw at khrushchev  you know what made him fall apart  he couldnt get into disneyland  thats good  you never heard that  well i did but when i hear you say it it sounds beautiful  i dont want any politics in my campaign you know that  but there should be  goodness and  confidence  thanks for listening to me don  you know sometimes i look around here  and i think  by golly im king midas  stop it  youre not  youre my angel you know that  youre like a son  in fact  sometimes youre more than a son to me  because you didnt have what they had  and you understand  thank you  i mean it  come in come in come in  i drove all the way down to get the mail and then i turned around and i debated it  i went past the exit a dozen times  my girl is due back  i know i shouldnt be here  its just i wanted to see you  i wasnt thinking  what do i say why are you here  oh there you are  carla this is henry francis   he works for governor rockefeller  its nice to meet you  so anyway i uh  i think this is an excellent venue for a fundraiser  oh good   ill have to check with my husband  of course  carla will you show mr francis out  i think i left the bath running  a pleasure to meet you    i i cant get this lucy do you mind  jesus knock it off  its a lucky strike commercial its got three cuts in it  so the hillbilly says that aint my finger  im gonna have to hear the beginning of that joke  lee  lee   whats going on  i i have no idea  does someone know whats going on speak up  i know  lee garner jr called me a couple of days ago im sorry  why is he calling you  i dont know  he did and he told me to get rid of sal  what  and you made an executive decision to do nothing  he was really drunk i thought it would blow over  i didnt even think hed remember  when you get in trouble you call mommy and daddy  he told me not to tell you so what was i supposed to do  everyones an account man what exactly do you think we do here crane  we handle clients  he wouldnt say a word he just left  sal youre fired   are you serious  lee garner jr wants you fired  were gonna find out what he wants to do with you imbecile  oh god  what the hell happened  what is going on  now youre gonna use your dying breath to tell don to fix this  don  lee garner has a problem with creative let don solve it he does it all now anyway  now   what did lee say to you  nothing i have to talk to don   let me talk to don  im doing as im told  is he busy  i can see you and i can hear you what do you want  who died  i screwed up with lee garner jr   what  how do i explain this   he told harry to fire me  harry  i didnt but now roger did   roger did what  he fired me  roger said to tell you to fix it those are his words  fantastic  thats a 25 million account you stuck your nose in crane  just get out  what happened  lee garner got drunk and he told harry to fire me  then roger got angry and he did  i think if i get away from lucky strike  and lay low from roger for a day or two everything will be fine  i understand what just happened what happened with the cut  oh the commercials fine  sal something mustve happened  i cant help you unless you tell me  we had a misunderstanding  jesus im not gonna ask again  he was drunk  and he cornered me in the editing room   cornered you  yes  and i backed him off  i told him i was married he was embarrassed and he left  you mustve been really shocked  i was believe me  but nothing happened  because nothing couldve happened because youre married  don i swear on my mothers life  are you sure you want to do that  who do you think youre talking to  i guess i was just supposed to do whatever he wanted  what what if it was some girl  that would depend on what kind of girl it was  and what i knew about her  you people  i didnt do anything but turn him down  hes a bully  lucky strike can shut off our lights  i think you know that this is the way this has to be  youll do fine  get me lee garner jr  i said i dont want salad  watch your tone young man  carla works for me not you  what do you want instead  you might as well call it a day  okay thank you   hi daddy  hi  how was your day  not good  i didnt want to bother you with it  but that man dropped by today from the governors office  carla met him  francine sent him over here  they want to have a fundraiser but her house isnt big enough  i dont care as long as i dont have to go   when is

night mrs draper  if youre here do i have to be here  because im leaving  no go ahead  good night boss   henry francis  hello  i thought id get the service  this is betty draper  i know that  listen i shouldnt have come by like that  i hope im not calling too late  no youre not  i checked with my husband about the fundraiser  the fundraiser  yes wed be glad to do that  hows tuesday the 17th  can you make it then is that good for you  okay  i guess youre going through with this  i had to  ill have my girl call you tomorrow to make it official  i look forward to it  let me know whats usually provided by the host  sure  goodbye    rome tehran tokyo are magnificent destinations  and thats really been the focus of almost every campaign youve had up till now  how to lure the american traveler abroad  what more do we need than a picture of athens to get our hearts racing  and yet the average american experiences a level of luxury  that belongs only to kings in most of the world  were not chauvinists  we just have expectations  well now theres one word that promises the thrill of international travel  with the comfort of home  hilton  how do you say ice water in italian  hilton  how do you say fresh towels in farsi  hilton  how do you say hamburger in japanese  hilton  hilton  its the same in every language  maybe fried chicken  i dont like the sound of hamburger and hilton  besides hamburger is already a foreign word  well see  its good  very good  its clever yet friendly  it draws you in  but what about the moon   excuse me  theres nothing about the moon  well right now thats not an actual destination  that wasnt the point  i said i wanted hilton on the moon  i couldnt have been more clear about it  well  ill admit i misunderstood that  im sure theres a way to fit that into this  well isnt this something  id like to speak with don in private  this is a good campaign one of the best  its modern its witty its eyecatching   it will change your business  calm down  im going to speak very honestly with you  i dont think folks do that often   probably scared  or they trust my work  you want me to just say yes to everything you do  most ad men believe that clients are the thing that gets in the way of good work  ive never experienced that  you did not give me what i wanted  im deeply disappointed don  this is a great campaign  fine  what do you want from me love  your work is good  but when i say i want the moon  i expect the moon  i said if he ran id support him  i havent decided yet  i voted for kennedy ill probably vote for him again  what a nice turnout  wheres henry francis  i dont know someones supposed to talk  i dont know anything about rockefeller thats why i did this  well i want to know how hes going to deal with the south  do you know how bad it must be for the negroes to descend on washington like that just to be heard  segregation is uncivilized its that simple  you know what my father says about the south  its not 1963 its 1863  oh thank you  uh mrs draper im elsa kittridge   i work with mr francis  pleasure to meet you  i assume hes been delayed  actually he asked that i address the group on behalf of the governor  oh  thats disappointing  i mean i dont think its going to help your fundraising  when you promise one thing and deliver another  well perhaps youre right  but he seemed to think i was a better match to the group  and i am extremely informed  in fact im the person who briefs mr francis  i think youll see i wont embarrass you in front of your friends  please begin whenever you want  oh no you begin dear  excuse me my name is betty draper  welcome to my home were going to listen to  elsa kittridge associate in the governors information office  first i would like to dispel the rumor that there is a mandatory contribution tonight  this is a taking of a pulse an exchange of ideas  please see that were not disturbed  hey  mr francis do you need anything  no marjorie i dropped something   where were you last night  calm down  why didnt you come why did you send that that woman  i watched the door all night like a sap  im sorry but i wanted you to come to me  oh the ego  would you listen to me you had to come to me  and why is that  because youre married  no henry   whats wrong  please  were locked in this office  what on the desk on the couch   we should get a room somewhere  no  its tawdry  im sorry  im very sorry i started this  i dont know what you want    mr sterlings here to see you  send him in  i heard conrad hilton left this building in a huff yesterday  who told you that  youve got your face so deep in hiltons lap youre ignoring everything else  everythings under control  you wont even let me meet the man  what do you think accounts does besides limit your brilliance  id tell you but i dont want to hurt your feelings  keep joking about it  weve had two clients in one week leave here angry important clients  is that what you want this place to be known for  that and some guy losing his foot in a lawnmower  i want to put you on notice you are in over your head  these children  unoffending innocent and beautiful  were the victims of one of the most vicious and tragic crimes  ever perpetrated against humanity  you can leave it on your station i dont mind   its all right  what was that  the funeral service for the little girls in birmingham  its so horrifying  are you okay  do you need a day off  no im fine thank you  i hate to say this  but its really made me wonder about civil rights  maybe its not supposed to happen right now   hello mr draper  hello  you just missed bedtime  theyre probably still awake  no dont bother with dinner  weve got chinese takeout  listen marty needs me to look over this work  dont wait up for me  i love you too  betts  what  hilton just called  im going in  i didnt hear the phone  go back to sleep   someones going to see you  then let me in  this is nice  what can i do for you  i dont know i wanted to talk  right  says the man as he unbuckles his pants  what do you want me to say  youve been flirting with me for months  so what  so i cant stop thinking about you  because im new and different  or maybe im exactly the same  tell me youve run past that stretch of highway in the past two weeks and not thought of me  not looked for me  but then i have the luxury of that last halfmile home  where i go through every step of the future until it ends  i know exactly how it ends  so what  you live two miles from here  your daughter was my student ive seen your wife in the market  i dont think youve done this before this way  i want you  i dont care  doesnt that mean anything to someone like you
