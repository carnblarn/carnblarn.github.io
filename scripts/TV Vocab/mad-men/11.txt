will you get me a glass of ice water  someone hasnt told the sun its october   miss holloway  mr draper  its the clients luncheon mr cooper said you were responsible  while mr sterling is out  didnt you handle most of mr sterlings catering questions  continue doing that  how is he have you visited  i have  hes less sickly  i hope he knows how concerned we all are   good morning chief  don  shes been a bitch lately   anyone else noticed that  absolutely   i like it  do you  this got kicked over from ed baltz at compton  we sent them firestone last month  because of our conflict with goodyear  this is how they repaid the favor  look at that i think its a modified  lionel transformer  well i never thought id say this  but what does the research say  weight loss is a hard thing to prove  no it isnt its before and after pictures  since the dawn of time  mr martin buckwald its inventor he calls it the per  or passive exercise regime  so it needs a name  the electrocizer  for a slimmer better you  that helps a little  regarding slimmer  buckwald has a fair amount of testimonials but unfortunately  none you can take a picture of  we tried to get our own testimonials  some of the fellas brought it home to their wives   and  its tricky i  gave it to jennifer  she took it the wrong way she told me to wear it  violet has it  she says the scales are the same but she hasnt given up on it  like she does with diets after a week  mitch and some of the other guys we had eight belts  again theres been no weight loss yet  who cares if it works  theyre offering us commission on media  plus a bounty on every unit upside of last years comps  but fake weight loss claims  thank you  what about her  shes obviously losing some kind of battle  you may have to let it out a little  maybe you should put her on your regimen of sprinting out the door  every day at 5 to 5  what im saying is  she did a heck of a job on belle jolie  maybe lightning will strike twice  i dont think peggys the answer  i promised buckwald wed go with our big guns  our big guns have been silent  did you need more water  this device is a new product  i would like you to give us your thoughts on it   right now  no  its a weight loss belt it says  it  stimulates the muscles imitating calisthenics  youd be perfect for it  why  because youre a woman  and wed like your point of view  im getting another account  its an assignment not an account  go ahead sweetheart take it for a spin  am i allowed to change the name  yes  thank you  thatll be all  i need 359 for the phone bill  i told you i never use it  but you do use the saltines  and the velveeta and the liverwurst i never even got any  i had some people over while you were out drinking on tuesday   thats your half of the phone you should use it more  i have work to do  i dont know why you do that  when i leave the office im done  do you have to go home  no  good  i dont want you to  i dont want to  why is this hard for me  mostly because i cant even imagine how hard it must be for you  i dont think about it  i mean i try not to  must be a powerful mind  you have there  because i cant control mine  i keep thinking about us being together   we are together  i know but  i dont know if i understand how this works  where it goes  im worried its a fantasy  its not  i told you  im right where im supposed to be  i just havent figured out what to do yet  im sorry would you like me to wait outside  its up to you  i  i did the work on the weight loss belt like you asked  that was fast  you asked me to  and what is your unique point of view  i wrote it down  summarize  its one day i dont know if i lost any weight  do you feel different  i wrote it down  peggy youre saying even less in here than you are now  its hard to put into words  then you have failed  you definitely feel something  that i think some women  would like to feel  where is that here  it vibrates  and that coincides with how you wear it  oh i see that here  a sensation  yes  it explains its success  and it basically made me think it was probably  unrelated to weight loss  we now have a benefit now we have to figure out  how to put it into words have another go at it  i will work on that mr draper  peggy just think about it deeply  then forget it  and an idea will  jump up in your face  thank you  excuse me maam i hate to bother you  im from the frederick air conditioning company  and id like to talk to you about an opportunity  to live in frozen comfort  im not interested  could i trouble you for a glass of water  its a scorcher out here  of course  thank you  thank you  you know we have many units in all price ranges  what  well im married to a salesman  and im sure my husband and i can  brave another week or however long  this indian summers going to be  can i come back when he is here  i mean a unit  here or in your living room  we wouldnt even have to alter your window  we could just cut a hole right above it  and see this gap  thats where your cool air whatever there is of it  is escaping   from that little space  yes  and theres a science to how heat patterns work  now what you need is a unit  here downstairs and one in your bedroom  thats if you have the right construction  that would be nice  i can take down some numbers you know measure everything  write up an estimate  something you could discuss with your husband when he comes home  i guess that would be okay  you know  my husband  i think he would rather go to sears  if thats what you want  you should go  i can just guess what this would cost  and put it on your door for your husband comes home  please go  fernando  we are pleased to hear that case sales have more than doubled  we still believe that most of the credit goes to your rum  say hello from me  bert cooper says it is a unique pleasure working with you  i just finished trying to talk  lucky strike off a ledge  junior or senior  senior  hes coming for lunch tomorrow to see if roger is still involved  and theyre having this lunch bedside i suppose  i invited him here to see for himself  he called my bluff  clear tomorrow  i need you to  draw focus from our guest of honor  bernie perel is number 2 in his class at columbia law school  he works with morgenthau  and having been captivated by him at more than one cocktail party  he is a charmer  i can see he does something for you  but i dont know if this is the right time  because youre getting so much younger every day  because i dont know if my heart would be in it  are you seeing that goy  a little bit  well i told you i wouldnt let that stop me  what if he were  youre mumbling  what if he were married  my goodness  jesus  nothings happened  good  but i have been thinking about it  the two of us together  it feels so natural i feel so close to him  really  hes married but i dont think hes happy  obviously  what does it matter nothings going to happen  all i know is what i see in the movies  its magical and then they start talking  about him leaving his wife and then he doesnt  i saw this one where the husband gets  the woman pregnant so he kills her  you dont want to be that woman  go ahead  please whatever it says its going to seem related to this  you are your own worst enemy  thats yours  you look tired  i am  youre working too much  no its just  maybe  its too hot in here anyway  you know were losing a lot of our cool air  through the windows in the dining room  what  nothing its just something the salesman said  what was he doing in the dining room  what are you talking about  you let a stranger in my house   dont raise your voice  i damn well will raise my voice  do you have any idea what could have happened  i could have bought an air conditioner  its hot  salesmen go into peoples homes every day  its like when you  turn on a television set and then you turn it off it  look you didnt want to spend the money  good night betty  i feel like i should make a speech  get back to work  welcome back you look good  honey  one hour thats all you get  now you be a good boy  i shall be both dog and pony  come on  he looks like death  i know his hair and his skin are the same color  not really  thats the spot  exactly where it happened  i can still feel it  miss holloway we brought you here because of your discretion  can you help us with this  his color  hey honey  well you know we dont need miami beach  but just do what you can do  can i kiss you  i dont know if i can handle it  we should have done this for nixon before the debates  the arrogance of that campaign its infuriating  being the incumbent is even harder  you cant just sit on your ass and look presidential  you probably shouldnt get so upset its not good for you  i missed you  you know that right  i missed you too  joannie joannie look at that mouth  youre not doing my lips  my rouge is too dark but i have this light lipstick  you going to draw freckles on me too like raggedy andy  look i want to tell you something because youre very dear to me  and i hope you understand it comes from the bottom of my  damaged damaged heart  you are the finest piece of ass i ever had  and i dont care who knows it  i am so glad i got to roam those hillsides   stop it  i mean it  ive had a lot of time to think about the things ive done  and been sorry about  and being with you is not one of them  red  thats not what i wanted  you look better  i should have come over  thats a silly idea damn it  soon the milk stains are going to meet the sweat stains  should we get out of here and let her sleep  id love to but the doors noisier than our talking  shes actually a good sleeper thank god  even with the heat rash  poor thing  and it actually gets hotter at night  did you think about buying an air conditioner  from that pushy young man yesterday  is that what he was selling  he looked like one of carltons squash buddies  made me sorry i answered the door  he was very pushy  he came in and started measuring things  don was not happy about that  don was there  no  carlton would break my arm  it was foolish letting him in  why would you tell him  it just came up  i wasnt thinking  what did he do  what do you think  he lost his temper  hes very protective  just as you requested a little of our local color  pastrami coleslaw sour pickles  i like it  its yankee barbecue  theyre all ours  here they are now   hello lee  hello don   lee  preston  jimmy preston  how do you do  its wonderful to see you  well from what i hear you boys had all but given me up for dead  i dont think its wrong for us to express our concern  for your wellbeing  well i know how much you love your delicatessen  but i know theres also something else  you want to discuss  youre worried about losing the lawsuit  there were no damages  but we lost  but there were no damages  blame is one thing malice is another  i worked my way  inside and out of the ftc  bought a lot of dinners in washington  you cant fight them   thats what lawyers are for  lawyers  ive seen a girl fight harder on her first date  than these beltway shuttlecocks  listen im a stockholder so i called chester conrad  in the surgeon generals office  and he assured me it would be at least three years  before they could compile a report  but legislation is in progress  we hear another year  or two beyond that they speculate  theyre going to put warning signs on the packages  theres still plenty of time before we have to worry about that  during which  we wait to see if share drops off  before we run for the hills looking for a new campaign   is that true  well it must be  he just said it  well ive been spending a lot of time with my wife  im glad we came by  i missed you all  you new yorkers  to new yorkers  may they always  jesus no again  are you okay  just give him some air give him some air  give him air   im okay  dont talk  this was stupid ill get the elevator  no theyre holding the elevator  im very sorry  mona sweetheart this was a mistake  i tried to talk him out of it but you people  mrs sterling i had no idea  i used to think you couldnt put a value on a human life  but i never asked bert cooper did i   sweetheart  go to hell bert  i dont need to tell you that don has everything under control  i dont know  without sterling  i may have a family business but im not an autocrat  i have a board  and my son wants to be the executive of an aluminum company  still your board  should give credit where credit is due  share  we all like don draper  but if i was you id find some way to show him that you all do too  hes a dead man you know even if he survives  what are you talking about most clients will put up  with one coronary from a partner cost of doing business two  are we going down  i wrote prepared and sent out my resume this afternoon  at company expense  look it doesnt take a genius to see whats going to happen  theyll bump draper up to partner everyone will fall in line  draper  it would have happened a long time ago if they werent so greedy  theyre already paying him his weight in gold  half the accounts at this agency came for draper  frank birmingham brings in a lot of accounts  come on you sit in that conference room  frank birmingham brings them in  and while theyre dozing off don goes through their wallets  what about mitch sullivan in media  hes fat bald and charmless  you think draper likes me  he rides me pretty hard sometimes   its hard to tell with him  he  likes you   i work at it  i work at it too  i can tell you do  you never know when hes doing it  theres not a man in this room  whos not holding don draper on their shoulders so that he can reach partner  hes not going to fire you   who said anything about that  no one  its just you dont think he deserves it do you  dont you know anything about business cleaning out the old guys  its good for us it opens up spots  my ma she wouldnt shut up about you  i told her i remembered you  isnt that nice   you smoke  all the time  its practically mandatory in our office  thank you  brandy alexander forla donna  and a rheingold  what you dont like it ill send it back  well my friend joan always orders them for me  theyre usually sweeter  shes a scream  she lives in the city  theres a bar  in manhattan where the glasses are chilled  whats in that  i dont know  so you drive a truck  yes  but i bought my own route  wise potato chips  really  i have an area thats just mine  the route was expensive but the hard part was learning that truck  special license  we have a potato chip account utz   you get free ones  i do  i dont know i dont like potato chips  you live out here right  prospect park i have my own apartment  well i share it with my roommate marjorie  shes a character  my sisters a secretary for bulova in flushing  i just got a new account the other day  i already wrote copy for belle jolie lipsticks  its going to be in a bunch of magazines  which ones  i dont think you read them theyre about high fashion  advertising doesnt work on me  its just a lot of people screaming at you from the walls and the tv  if advertising is good people never think it works  how do they know it does did they ever prove that  why are you insulting what i do  so you drive a truck  you do  im my own boss you know  you get off the train every day  at grand central and they spray you with gold  let me tell you  you can act like youre from manhattan  but you dont look like those girls  hey hold on  that wasnt nice  i feel sorry for you  i said im sorry  those people in manhattan  they are better than us  because they want things they havent seen  ill be up i want to check on roger   hello  hello its don draper  what can i do for you  i dont know what you do for anybody   mr draper you sound hostile  after hundreds of dollars  all youve managed to do is make her more unhappy  i understand this is frustrating for you  this has nothing to do with me its her  you took a woman with a bad case of nerves  and you made her weaker not stronger  im afraid to leave her alone  all i can say is that its a process and time is part of it  if youd like to expedite things we can put her in psychoanalysis   what are you doing now  psychoanalytic psychotherapy  psychoanalysis would mean a minimum of three sessions a week  and optimally five  thank you  ill think about that  over there  theres no chair  i really wish i could have come in and prepared first  sorry this is the way it works  of course  i only have one and a carbon  thats all i had time to do youll have to share  come on just give it to one of the girls  ready when you are  women lose weight so theyll feel good about themselves  healthier more attractive  rejuvenate has a latin root  which literally means the return of youth  the rejuvenator gives you the flush and glow  not only that you might have after hours of exercise  but certainly as a young girl  isnt it nice  to feel that way whenever you want  combined with a sensible diet the rejuvenator  youll love the way it makes you feel  look im not going to wait to see how don lands on this  im going to tell you its good  nice end run around the weight loss  i think its good too but what does it do  from what i understand it provides  the pleasure of a man without the man  weve been replaced  thats why mitchs wife didnt want to take it off  id love to see her in that  shes already so hot to trot  with the knot at the bottom   she was falling out of it  jayne mansfield  mitchs wife is very attractive  i dont know her  first of all no latin  you sound like a valedictorian  and the name still isnt right  lastly  you still might need to give us a hint at what it does  i could be more explicit  i was thinking of calling it stimulating  i think you need like a code word  like i dont know  like refreshing  ill think about that  my god freddie doesnt your wife have one  whats your point ken  my point is didnt you say she loved it  thats funny  you know what to do here  ill get arrested just doing the layouts  now  that wasnt so bad  looks like everybody liked it  i can tell  freddies wife does not look like mitchs  you know  good work pegs  come in  mr draper i dont want to seem ungrateful  but i think i could serve sterlingcooper and you  better as a copywriter if i had my own desk  you have a desk  but now i have radio spots  peggy the conversation of a raise is not inappropriate  at this moment but do not be timid  you presented like a man  now act like one  i want 500 a week more  jesus what do you make  35 a week  well thats a 15 kick  don a word  cooper and draper just went into sterlings office tell me when  they come out of there will you  sure ill just sit here and watch the door  thats all ill do  who the hell do you think youre talking to  is he dead  no quite the opposite they let him go home to convalesce  and  i want to make you a partner  as a symbolic gesture i think telling me that in here is in bad taste  thats the way it works roger knows that  im not adding your name to the masthead  im restoring faith to our clients  i accept  ill start you at 12 and see how both you and roger do  of course youll remain creative director  and to fill the position of head of account services  you are the only member of the blue ribbon committee  do i hire from inside or outside  i just made you partner do i have to do everything  no contract  of course youd say that  beware the nonconformist  im going to introduce you to miss ayn rand  i think shell salivate  is he dead  so whens he coming back  you know i think this office is too big for me  i might need it if im going to lure  in marty brennen as head of account services  then its true congratulations   thank you  i mean it  you know i admire your work   i believe you  i hope you do  and i dont think it can be denied that we make a very good team  you know what  i do like this office  i think roger would want me to have it  that way hell always know he can have it back  i hope youre aware that id love to throw my hat in the ring  i am now  peggy we have both had very good days  im working on it  you may leave your post  its 430  im sorry thats the best i can do at this point  i have work to do  you can have your raise  and ill talk to miss holloway about getting someone on your desk  while you attend to your assignment  can i tell her  sure  in the meantime go with your friends  celebrate  good night mr draper  good night  back away from the set come on  youll burn your eyes out  hi daddy  i would have made you dinner but i called the office and no one answered  should i fix something  no i was supposed to have a meeting with a client but it got cancelled  i got made partner  my god don thats wonderful  don you were right about letting people in the house  im so sorry  i dont want to talk about that  the heats supposed to break tomorrow  itll probably be snowing in two weeks
