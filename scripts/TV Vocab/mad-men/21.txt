keep to yourself  you know there are many ways to be involved  theres a committee for the cyo dance  and for selfish reasons  i would love to take advantage of your professional services again   what do you mean  publicity  last years poster was girls in garlands dancing around a maypole  i dont think thats what the kids want  no they dont  im so busy right now father  think of it as pro bono  talk to your boss  i really would like the kids to show up  hes ready to see you father  ill get you the specifics  as of today you are costing this company  more than you are making it  excuse me  tim dunst called from maytag apparently last night  their switchboard lit up like a christmas tree   i didnt hear  youre the head of the tv dpt  so i know you cant watch everything  but who exactly oversaw the placement of maytag in the abc sunday night movie  i take full responsibility  there was a scene with a murderous russian spy  who was referred to as an agitator repeatedly  and this led into a maytag spot  the title of which is the amazing agitator  really  is this all a big joke to you  the russians are still our enemy you know  this will not happen again  crane were eating this one  politics aside you need to be aware  that a client will take any excuse not to pay us  you need to get your department in line or ill gut it  yes sir ill get to the bottom of this  hey harry whats the name of that place we went to  with the wallpaper and the kebabs  i dont remember can one of you help me read tv scripts   for money  i dont think so  theres too much to read and i have nobody  there are things to do that i didnt know were my job  how could that be you made that job up  i thought it would be a liaison between the networks and the agency  and i dont know buy time  thats what your job was before  so now what its a whole nother job  thats why we have juniors someone to blame  you need someone to lay down on the barbed wire so you can run over them  heineken was pleased but confused  by the fact that you dont use their product  thats why i brought campbell  so whats the problem  theyre set on competing at the tap  we just have to find a way  to excite your average tavern inhabitant and theyll be happy  did you explain to them that theres a market thats actually excited  about heineken being imported  for women entertaining in the home holland is paris  they can buy this sophisticated beer  and proudly walk it into the kitchen instead of hiding it in the garage  im just telling you i sensed resistance  if you want to get some research ill get them into a room with you again  well go up and down the hudson northern new jersey  connecticut the cash belt  set up a few endaisle displays at the aps away from the other beer  surrounded by cheese and crackers and toothpicks with cellophane tips  we can try that maybe short uneven stacks  make it look popular plus housewives love green  well go make some calls  youre still going to have to sit down and sell this to them  by the way i hate to disappoint your wife  but i dont know about sunday night  id worry more about disappointing roger  he seemed to think it was important that we sit down with crab colson  and believe me im sure my wife would rather go see a movie  whos crab colson  rogers  cowan  mr sterling is here to see you  send him in please   roger  crane  mitch says you want to expand your department  looks pretty big already  the way other television dpt have the set up  and ive checked have on this up  there should be a dedicated man for broadcast operations  and what is he dedicated to  reading scripts meetings to discuss  im really the face of the television department for the clients  have you noticed were full up whos going to pay this person you  the money we save avoiding surprises will make it worthwhile   you smoke crane  sometimes  how do i know youre not just goldbricking  because thats what mitch thinks  i dont want to speak out of turn  warren do you mind  i dont think mitch has been very happy with my recent promotion   are you  yes of course  figure out a way to do the job yourself  you better not repeat any of that to mitch  peggy olsens office  may i speak with miss olsen this is father john gill calling  peggy olsen speaking  hello peggy this is father john gill   do you have a minute  yes did you get the flyer  yes  its good  but can you take whatever this is and make it into a poster  what do you mean whatever this is  well theres been some discussion  dont you like it  the cyo committee is curious about a night to remember  whats the problem  well they feel it sends the wrong message to the girls  its wholesome and romantic  and you have to get the girls its the only way the boys will come  tell them that this is the way it works and i know better than them  peggy couldnt you just speak with them  they just want to feel involved  of course id love to hear their thoughts   goodbye father  goodbye  mr crane may i be of some assistance  im sorry  what  i received a memo from mr sterlings office  saying that you need a girl to help you with your workload  no its not exactly what i asked for  i dont know what you had in mind but we are spread very thin   hello joan  hello warren  you  you look great today  thank you warren  i need someone to run our commercial scripts  past the networks for approval   cant you just use a messenger  no that person also has to read  the network scripts for me  and really make sure are clients arent misrepresented  i dont feel comfortable sending my girls out of the building  but i will find someone to read the scripts  my wife is pregnant  i just want to get out of here at a reasonable hour  how many are there  and what are they looking for  we just want to nip any problems in the bud  for example if a kids pushing away his dinner in disgust  just make sure its not gortons fish sticks  you know people cant be coughing and dying right before a lucky ad  things like that its common sense really  it sounds interesting  it is for the first few  and theres maytag in there  theyre very sensitive to communism  why cant i do that   because you already have a job  no i mean talk to her like that  shes so much woman   you are so graceful  she is adorable  theyre doing winnie the pooh this year shes going to be piglet  its all very professionallooking  cheryls 14 she wont even waltz on my feet anymore  ours is engaged  enjoy it while you can  crab can i get you another one of those  like the song says id be a fool to say no   roger  ladies first  all right the

 oh come on  ill have something with dinner  beautiful drive   did you take the sawmill  i did  found myself heading to new rochelle by accident   i used to live there  its lovely there  ill tell you the way to go were taking our sloop  from my folksplace in old lyme  all the way down to larchmont for race week  we should get a boat  my father had a boat almost killed him  you might as well cut a hole in your pocket  the slip and the dry dock and the yacht club  speaking of which don  are you and bets joining willow oaks or not  were lonely  if you wish you can leave your drinks here  and join us in the ding room  terrific  so rogers  cowan its a good place to be right now  he does everything you need him to do you know  how did that get there  were going to take a little trip around the world  starting in spain with gazpacho  followed by japan rumaki  and then well stop by duchess county  for a leg of lamb mint jelly accompanied by egg noodles  the way my grandmother made them from germany  and we have a choice of burgundy from france  or a frosty glass of beer from holland  did you bring a case from work   no  please draper  youll do anything to win an argument  i dont understand  you went out and bought that at the store  carla did some of the marketing but no i did why  im not ever allowed to pick where i sit  whats so funny  crab if you want to be in business with someone who knows their stuff  heineken is one of our clients  he said you were the market and you are   that is funny  incredible  at an interesting experiment  i have to sit down  please do  now who wants wine  please start  the soup is delicious  to our hosts  and their idyllic country home  and to new friends  hear hear  a night to remember is every girls dream  it holds the wholesome promise of the kind of handholding  that eventually leads to marriage  i think its exactly what we talked about  i dont like the way theyre dancing  theyre too close together  maybe leave some room for the holy ghost  maybe theyre doing a box step  fine  youre not worried about having a dance full of girls only  when the boys hear that the girls are going  boys arent going to hear nothing they dont go to school together  they go to church together  and this isnt the first cyo event  thats true  id never thought about that but youre right  im just saying im not an expert  but there might be another slogan  what do you want two flyers  no we dont have to throw this one away  but maybe we can  i think shes saying maybe we should try something else  thank you very much ill see what i can do  youre such a doll  could i speak to you a minute  father i wanted to talk to you too  we can speak tomorrow  thank you all for your generosity and your time  father i dont mind working  but this is completely unnecessary  well i dont understand  did you agree with them  the dancers could be farther apart  but you were very persuasive  you dont have to agree with them in fact youre not supposed to  you asked me to do this based on my expertise  well im not really on the committee  im more of a liaison  youre supposed to tell them that they should trust me  thats your job theyll listen to you  youre right  im sorry this is so much work  no i can turn it around   and the copy machine  yes i cleared it  im sorry father i dont mean to be disrespectful  im very tired  well both be prepared next time  good night peggy i really am glad youre here  me too  you didnt set the table  im sorry you came back so fast  ill get plates  youre not going to believe what happens on as the world turns   youre right about that  let me ask you something  is it possible for someone to come out of a coma  and have no recollection of who they are  honestly people dont come out of comas much  really so its also probably ridiculous  they would have an accent they didnt have beforehand  yes  it must have happened to somebody  they wouldnt make it up completely right  probably once makes a good story  im going to get my drink do you want something  water  i didnt know you were such a reader  its part of my job  i thought you just walked around with people staring at you  you  what are you bothering with that for  you should be looking for a house  what happened to your fascination with glen cove  you told me to stop looking  well i just need to finish my training  joanie you should be  not reading them  with a box of bonbons on your lap them  to soothe your cravings  its a hoot  i guess thats okay  im glad you approve  we arent you getting me a glass of water hon  of course  carla why dont you go home we can do all this in the morning  that jam will set  let me at least put the dishes in the basin  thats a good idea  if you want you can go to bed ill show myself out  call louis to pick me up  its okay we had a long day  thank you for all your help  good night mr draper  good night carla  it was a great success  you embarrassed me   what are you talking about  you embarrassed me  what did i do  you knew i would buy that beer  so what  because you know me so well  you know everything about me  bets i use our life all the time in my work  they pay me for that  and then you laughed  you all laughed  must be so funny being in on it  come on  youre taking this the wrong way  you embarrassed me  im sorry  i didnt mean it  you never mean it you just do whatever you want  and i put up with it because nobody knows  no one is going to rember that you know what theyre going to remember  petra colson missing her chair  come on leave this youre tired lets go upstairs  im not going to bed  not until you tell me why you insist on humiliating me  i cant talk to you when youre like this  youre making a mountain out of molehill  i know about you and that woman  what  damn it don i know youre having an affair  you and bobbie barrett  what  how could you shes so old  betty thats ridiculous  im just telling you i know  fine bets  what do you know  go ahead tell me  jimmy told me everything   he hates me  he told me everything  please what the hell did he say  so you can pick it apart twist all my words  im not going to dignify jimmy barrett  with a response hes a big mouth  and dont pretend i dont know how he looks at you  i saw you two together  you think you know me  i know what kind of a man you are  you think i would sleep with that woman  you cant help yourself  admit it  theres nothing to admit  youre lying  im going to bed   good morning  good morning daddy  mommy said the party was fun  did she  bye daddy   daddy suit  ive done my part the rest is up to her  dont pay attention to that due date itll drive you nuts  d day  hello  this is mr pastor and mr costas from maytag   are we all better now  yes  process seems to be streamlined  wait a minute is she the one we spoke to on the phone  yes joan is handling broadcast operations  i had no idea  i would have combed my hair before called you  ive got next weeks scripts   dont hold anything back now  she wont  it was nice to meet both of you in person  indeed  hell of an operation youve got here  i think so  gentlemen  phil good to see you as always  francis  can we get you something  weve got a fridge full of heineken out there  no its 11 am for petes sake  thanks for coming by we were just so excited  i thought you should hear it from the horses mouth  what exactly happened  well  we explained to you before that research shows  that with the rise in commuters  and the relative scarcity of suburban bars  people are drinking more in the home  yes we heard you  entertaining housewives et cetera  were not against it  we just think our money would be spent better elsewhere  and honestly i agree with you  but well we ran a little test  and the results were very enlightening  don  we targeted a few wealthy suburban markets  with womanfriendly endaisle displays   was there a spike  the sample was very small  but what we put out sold well  more important was who it sold to  this is an untapped market  where you dictate the competition  i think i can say this because dons being modest  dons wife shes a peach of a girl  they had a dinner party  were talking days after placement and she had  this elaborate elegant setup foods from around the globe  and sure enough there was your heineken  right next to the bone china and the polished sterling   it was incredible  not exactly scientific  although it sounds like you do know your wife  shes exactly who were after  welloff educated with plenty of time to shop  and its important for her  that shes the perfect hostess the perfect wife  we even talked about using her menu verbatim  in selected ladiesmagazines  really  we havent been there yet  no but its what ive been pushing for  and so i take your word on this  why would i lie  were the ones who are going to have to deliver  i guess we can throw it in the mix  lets start regional  see how some strangerswives feel  i would recommend buying air time during love of life  women watching tv during the day  like to fantasize about having active lifestyles  they like where they could be going with sea  ski  and they watch every day  i know my daughter missed a lot of classes in college for her stories  my wife brought the tv home  there you go  mr hansen i dont know how mr crane feels about this  but ive been reading the scripts and i just have to say  as the world turns is about to become unmissable  i dont want to give it away but someone people think is dead  is not  im glad you like it but they all do the same things dont they  no not at all  this is what they call a special summer storyline  and ive spoken to logan reynolds over at cbs  and its going to receive a lot of promotion   is it the same price  theyre all close  this sounds better  well if you lock them in at this rating and then they exceed it  theres a bang for your buck factor isnt there   i would say so  then you should do that  i think youll be pleased  thats why i didnt want to do this on the phone  i love what she says  and i love the way she says it  let me walk you out  are you okay mommy  im okay sweetheart  im just not feeling very well  do you want some aspirin  no sally  im just going to rest a little bit okay  go play with your brother  crane thanks for squeezing me in  you said 430  hell is it only 430  sorry about that  listen ill be brief since it appears im on my way out  ive received a lot of unsolicited phone calls  simply put the customers are satisfied  and so is the accounting department keep up the good work  im not doing it on my own  thats true isnt it  why dont we get those secretaries back to their regular jobs  its just joan holloway actually  so her attentions are divided at best  make it a fulltime position  and he has to share an office  sounds perfect  hello  where are the kids  bed  what happened here  nothing  nothing happened here  i went through every pocket and every drawer  and theres nothing  would you stop  how much have you had to drink  i dont know why i even bother looking  all i found were stacks of cocktail napkins  with stupid advertising on them  what are you doing bets  i would never do this to you  how could you do this to me  i didnt do anything  what time is it  i dont want it to be like this  me either  i dont know what to do  dont  nothing happened  now you look me in the eye  you never do that  yes i do  you never say you love me  yes i do  you know i do  i say it all the time  no you dont  do you hate me  god no  i love you bets  i do  and i love the children  i dont want to lose all this  this is a very impressive operation  its madison avenue  look at this  did we get miracle whip  i dont know makes a lot of sense  shes an undercover nun  so turk doesnt know which way to turn hes so drunk  so finally he stops  we get out of the car  and the sign says bridge out   hello joan  you wanted to see me   joan this is danny lindstrom  dan  hes going to be in charge of broadcast operations  excuse me  i really appreciated you filling in i couldnt have asked for more  joan knows everything about this  that makes one of us  ive already given him next weeks scripts  it would be great if you could fill him in on how it works  right now  why not are you busy  no not at all  its really just reading scripts all of them  and looking through the storylines to see if theres any  possible benefits to our clients  how their products may be portrayed to their advantage  and of course getting the cooperation of the networks  thats pretty much what i said  not exactly  listen youre going to be around  to help with the details right  yes of course  anything else  no joan and thank you again  this is wonderful its completely automatic  i just leave it  if you set the number  you know dont think we dont know  how lucky we are having you do this for us  thank you its nice to be included  peggy do you have something you need to talk about  excuse me  ive noticed that you dont take communion  and i dont think its too much of a leap  to ask if theres something you need to talk about  no  god already knows whatever it is peggy  well then i dont need to talk  well im here right now  father dont take this the wrong way  but i dont think youd understand  god is bigger than what we were raised on  father you dont have to live life like the rest of us  maybe youre lucky  ive lived life  i wasnt born a priest  of course not  you know when you distance yourself from the church  you are distancing yourself from everything  thats why its called communion you know  its not just being with god  its being with people  i know that  well then why are you pushing everyone away  im not  there is no sin too great to bring to god  you can reconcile yourself with him  and have a whole new start  youre a smart beautiful young girl you have so much to offer  do you feel you dont deserve his love  your copies are done  ill put them in a box for you  there you go  thank you very much peggy ill see you on sunday  yes of course  imagine my horror when a night on the town turned ugly  this is a nice place for nice people and the jerk behind the bar  he throws a bowl of nuts at me  what am i a squirrel  lucky for him i carry my own wherever i go  am i crazy i dont think so  just you try and stick your face into a can of nuts  take it from a nut utz are better than nuts  we have chains in almost every suburban market  on the east coast plus chicago cleveland  its a vote of confidence  mrs draper is on the line  i got to take this  thank her again for me  hello  dont come home  what  i dont care what you do i just dont want you here  i dont want to see you
