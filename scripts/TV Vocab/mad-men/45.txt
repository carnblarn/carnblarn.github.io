c for the common bus  layzboy the cure for the common chair  budweiser the cure for the common beer  manufacturers hanover bank  the cure for the common bank  how about alkaseltzer the cure for the common cold  the cure for the common cold  is the idiom im playing off  its an idiom did you know that  uo other than your summer internship at needham  do you have any actual advertising experience  the cure for the common chair  thats rogers favorite  roger sterling  hes the guy i shook hands with when i came in  what did roger think of this ad  what are you kidding me everybody loves that  its the opposite of what you expect  thats what im interested in  why is it in your book  ive got a bunch of them in there  marlboro man maidenform  i like to put in work that i admire  dont you ever tear things out of magazines  yes but i dont put them in my book  aspirations as good as perspiration  thats not how it goes  look  im a 24yearold kid  i want to be in the ad game  i know ive got a lot to learn but im a hard worker  id sweep up the floors around here  i dont know if roger told you that  he did talk to you didnt he  he did  it was really a pleasure to meet you danny   i wish you the best of luck  best of luck in in what   what do you mean  you trailed off  well let you know  do you know a good place to eat around here  tell my secretary youre hungry  and see what she suggests  are we on candid camera  i dont want to jump on his grave or anything  but theres no way hes 24  im 25  whats his connection to roger  besides being delusional  hes jane seigels cousin  its a relief to see  someone worse than me and really know it  dont get used to it  well you know i look at glocoat  and see how far everythings come  you know my work  glocoat  you finish something you find out everyone loves it  right around the time that  it feels like someone else did it  is that your speech for the clios  they dont have speeches  were going to win  just because it got nominated  doesnt mean theyre going to give me an award  arent you excited  i try not to think about it  then you must be excited  well itd be good for the agency  grey doubled their value in five years and it was all based on awards  you got anything on vicks   actually its vick chemical  answer the question  were very behind  your new art director has been waiting for synchronicity  which involves me coming up with a bunch of ideas  chasing him down and having him draw all of them and lose them  hes your new art director too and you have a deadline  and dont think you can spend monday hiding behind corners  and trying not to make eye contact i will find you   im not the problem  you are  because an is talented and more experienced  you need to learn how to work with him not the other way around  well good luck this afternoon  youre not supposed to say that  oh well break a leg  charlie chaplin was very lonely  that tramp too much of a sad sack  laurel and hardy they were better  except hardy was

his book   it was filled with old ads  plagiarism thats resourceful  he had five originals   they were all the same thing  i told him to be himself   that was pretty mean i guess   so when does he start  the first of never  well you havent been married for a while  so youve probably forgotten how these transactions work  if i dont hire janes cousin  its probably going to cost me a personal gift expenditure  of between 500 and 1000   when are we leaving  right after life cereal  to new business  and victory at the waldorf  i mean it you deserve it  so i can s show you whats popular whats unique  and the only thing i ask is that you call me don  well don i cant say i know my fu that well  i know my mother had a chinchilla  i was always on the verge of a romantic relationship with it   is this for your mother  i bet you never hear that  i dont would you like to give me a price range  well thats an interesting question i have a unique problem  i need to spend a lot but be careful not to spend too much  not a unique problem i dont want to be forward  but can i assume this is some kind of an apology  no no no i know exactly how much that costs  this is im getting to know you but i dont want to scare you  i know what were gonna do  so now its we  its always the right size  and nothing says mink like mink  its a nice way to ease into things  and you can always come back for the rest of it  how about we split the difference so they wear them to their waist  its the most popular this year  why wait for a man to buy you a fur coat  thats a dumb question who does your work   i do  really  yeah its an interest of mine and they let me do it  look at that can i give you a call  first of all you need 20 of those  and second of all no  i just want you to call that number  so i

didnt start without me did you  no don i would not do that  okay everybody ready  so  life cereal delicious crispy  and its got a big name you know  and i know you want to associate it with health  but thats not fun joey  ah you know what ive got it  look there are sweeter cereals than this  but i kept thinking about you know  nostalgia  how you remember something in the past  and it feels good but its a little bit painful  like when you were a kid  thats the truth and life  thats a scary word to anyone at any age  so how do we make it fun  eat life by the bowlful  a little kid big bowl big spoon  kids see the giant bowl of cereal and they smile  because you know theyd eat a box of it if they could  and moms see it and they get this twinge  of how little their kid still is  even though they have to deal with life  get those two together in a market  and i think were going to sell some cereal  thats all i have  i think if youd invite us into the rest of your company  we could build a saturday morning tv show  around the whole quaker oats family  in fact it could be called the quaker oats family  i like the bowlful  but i think its kinda smart for regular folks you know   the irony i guess  children look at the picture  moms look at the irony  yeah but when i go back to chicago  all theyre gonna wanna hear is a slogan  and i dont think this is gonna cut it  well why dont we let don work that over  we can either talk on monday if youre staying the weekend  or we can come see you in chicago  ive got it ive got it pete  how about  life is just a bowl of life cereal  life is sweet  uh  enjoy the rest of your life cereal  don theyre not expecting you to do this right now  give me a second  life the reason to get out of bed in the morning  life the cure for the common breakfast  life its sweetness never ends   life eat it by the bowlful  oh oh there you go  the cure for the common breakfast   love it  its got the health angle  life makes you feel better  its got

by yourself  ken is proven  hes hungry  and he has accounts  birdseye a beverage called mountain dew  and fillmore auto parts  which has entered the national arena  he would more than pay for himself
