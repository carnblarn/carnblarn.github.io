case  part of this job is doing things you dont wanna do  most of it  its good to be back draper i missed you  then it must notve been much of a honeymoon  im sorry welcome back  hows married life  its pretty swell  i was raised that men dont wear jewelry  i kindve like it  trudys a lot funnier then i thought  im actually looking forward to going home tonight  well i look forward to meeting her  hey maybe one of these nights  we could get dinner together with the wives  maybe we can  you know girls wed be happy to bring you coffee  i was on my way over anyways  i have something of yours  lady chaterleys lover i finished it last night  good to the last drop right  i can see why it got banned  well you dont have to be so shy about it its literature  that is a huge pocketbook joan  well it has a change of clothing and a toothbrush in it  a hope chest  have you read this peggy  i dont think thats a good idea  theres um  this word in it a lot  i know the word joan  well its sad really  because even with its reputation men wont read it  and they really should  i dont care if its 500yearsold  its another testimony to how most people think marriage is a joke  they rip a lot of clothing  yeah its a fantasy  hes married and shes married  the desperate passion of the forbidden  can i borrow it  shes making it sound better then it is  theres a few good parts thats all  and the book just opens to those pages by itself  hey dont read it on the train  itll attract the wrong element  bye  so the doctor says to him i hope youre happy  while you were out finishing a round of golf  your wife was in a horrible accident  she is gonna need round the clock care  bathing toilet  then the doc looks at him and says  im just kidding shes dead  hey whatd ya shoot  well we have and initial research report  and what i think are some very astute market observations  mr draper  pleased to see you didnt disappear the minute you cashed my check  we appreciate your business  kenny or course you know  harry crane media  and mr george pallham over here who is from research  and who has more degrees then a russian protractor  thats quite an introduction  from the other side of the pond i see  we take his word for it  so uh that is yours to keep  but if youd like to follow along  youll see from the overview  our primary focus was saks  henri bendel and bonwit taylor  our research uncovered a variety of options  they utilize to attract  your desired customers  one thing these stores have in common  is a comfortable shopping environment  spacious open salesfloors  an almost conspicuous lack of clutter  the merchandise is minimal and neatly presented  on tables and in display cases  this less is more philosophy  is also efferent in the window displays  for example  only one sweater to a window  as opposed to windows stuffed with merchandise  my fathers going to love that  believe it or not it even applies to the mannequins  bendles takes the heads off theirs  so the shopper can imagine them to be anyone  anyone without a head  along with these cosmetic changes  youll also need to provide what we call  boutique extras  a personal shopping service  private fashion shows  designer collections  this is comprehensive  its the lay of the land  just from holding it i feel more informed  about my competitors then ever  and yet my store already has a personal shopping service  and designer collections  if you were so focused on my competitors  that you failed to visit my store  ive been away on my honeymoon  ive been there a few times  its a beautiful old place  miss menken i can assure you  that no one at this table has ever been to your store  a wrong i will personally correct this afternoon  its right on 5th ave  thats one big block over and a dozen little blocks up  its been there for 30 years   ill walk you out  ive got it  harry  what  its nice the way you handled that  its hard to get caught in a lie  well it wasnt a lie  it was ineptitude with insufficient cover  something about the way you talk  always restores my confidence  i have a deep voice  this afternoon then  its a date  new junior exec  changing her store could take six months  or a year if i know whats good for me  what was that in there  what  don and molly goldberg did you see that  yeah i caught it whats your point  i dont know i mean everybody always jokes about it  but ive never seen draper really turn that switch on before  well i guess he likes her what would you do  trying to quit  you are really putting he junior in junior executive  look youre married now right  im a part of that club now too two very happy years  but when im out in the world  i dont know i dont do it much im not good at it  the flirting the double intandras  you mean something on the side  no i mean enjoying the company of women  in the limited way a married man can  well thats all we have really  i cant speak for everyone but its plenty for me  i see i guess on some level  i always thought draper was the same way  draper  who knows anything about that guy no ones ever lifted that rock  he could be batman for all we know  mr campbell your wifes on the phone  theres bird shit on the couch  that was priceless  hello honey  dinner  what do i want for dinner  i dont know  anything but chicken  yes they missed me  ribeye in the pan with butter  ice cream  i love you too  theres going to be dinner waiting for me when i get home  yeah how about that  mr curland is mitigating a skirmish in our housewares section  why do i hire young girls  because they cost practically nothing  costume change  this is my closet  the original tenants laid the last brick  the day before the crash  boy were they in for a surprise  as i hope you note by now  our original store was just off 7th avenue  it was just hosiery  then they started pulling piecework from sweatshops  by 1932 those people had failed  my father and uncle picked this place up for a sheckle  well it is  crowded but that might have something to do with the sale  which means that if were successful  youre gonna lose the customers you have  in order to get the customers you want  i was gonna start with raising prices  can you imagine what my father said  well you do have to give them something  for their higher dollar counts  its just  awfully hard to define what that is  how may i help you  i make them say that  carol can we see this tray right here  sea horses  crowns  lucky dice  medieval knights  thats better  thank you  lets take a look at the second floor  were known for our service  thats gotta be a tough job  i know  ive always like how quiet it is up here  well that might explain the lack of customers  i can see the charm but  the room is too dark too old fashioned  the products look old  but the people look wonderful  its a shame were gonna have to lop their heads off  itll ruin your favorite part of the store  its not my favorite part actually  the grand lot of us are going to lanskys  can you believe it  have a swell time  ive got plans  you look nice  hell manhattan at your feet  i can see the appeal  the views okay  no this is my favorite part of the store  hey there missy  havent seen you in a while  how did they get the penthouse  they patrol  its the only way to make sure  there isnt anyone hiding in the store at night  they know im with you right  these two are carla and leona  not the originals its the third generation  and what every generation of menken dog  shall be named until the end of time  i made my fathers legal counsel add that  to the stores bylaws when i was nine  so even then you enjoyed telling men what to do  to be fair the store was practically home  my father liked to work  i used to come out here and talk to them  well the originals every night  for a little girl a dog can be all you need  they protect you they listen  i had my sister but there werent other kids  and of course my mother wasnt around  well thats not always a bad thing  who knows  she died when she was having me  anyway my sister became my only company  and frankly these bitches were easier to handle  what is this  dont try to convince me that you were ever unloved  i dont know what to say  listen  im married  i guess i didnt ask cause i didnt wanna know  shouldnt have happened  well you couldnt help yourself  i knew what i wanted  from the first time you stormed out of our office  you stormed out of your office  i took you up here that was stupid  i just so looked forward to seeing you again  now i guess thats over  i know you understand id rather not have to explain this to anyone  the account stays i just  want someone else on it  dont look at me like that  what do you do just kiss women all the time  women you arent married to  of course not  then am i
