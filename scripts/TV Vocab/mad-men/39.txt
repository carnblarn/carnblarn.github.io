theyre buying putnam powell  lowe  what  im sorry but that means im going to have to  move my new york properties elsewhere  why  because ppl owns sterling cooper  youre all gonna be part of mccann   so were all gone  sterling i dont know  cooper will definitely be put on an ice floe  but youre a prize pig youll make more money pick up stock  you wont have to live and die with every account  bulls  its a sausage factory i turned them down three years ago  this happens all the time don  its business  id ask them to put you on the caribbean hotels  but i dont think im gonna stay there much longer  you come and go as you please  yes i do  and you dont give a crap that my future  is tied up in this mess because of you  you wanted my account and you were lucky to get it  and you wanted to play with me  kick me around knock me down to size while you called me son  i get it now connie  its business  you know  i got everything i have on my own  its made me immune to those who complain and cry because they cant  i didnt take you for one of them don  are you   some other time well try again  yes  have a nice holiday    thats half last year  we aint gonna make it  its as fair a shake as we

got no choice  sure i do  ive got a silo  store it till winter when the price goes up   how you gonna pay your mortgage  thats none of your concern   settle down were all in this together  no we aint thanks to you  i take care of mine you take care of yours  damn it whitman this is a cooperative  no more  now get out of my kitchen  whats so urgent that you had to wake me  conrad hilton told me ppl is being sold and us along with it   so you knew about this  no but it makes sense  all that shortterm thinking  so what do we do  theres nothing to do i have a contract  you have a contract roger has a contract  so thats it  youre losing your business and you dont care   i lost my business last year  well do something about it  if sterling cooper is for sale why dont we buy it from ppl  we could put everything back the way it was  young men love risk  because they cant imagine the consequences  and you old men love building golden tombs  and sealing the rest of us in with you  youre done you know that right  so i should just throw away my fortune  i dont have the rest of my life to earn it back  i understand ill let you get back to sleep  why do you care  because im sick  of being batted around like a pingpong ball  who the hell is in charge  a bunch of accountants trying make 1 into 110  i want to work i want to build something of my own  how do you not understand that  you did it yourself  thats true  but im not sure you have a stomach for the realities  try me  well were gonna need accounts  american tobacco  thats most of sterling cooper but thats roger  i understand that  did hilton tell you when this blessed event is supposed to take place  new years day   we have to talk to roger now  you talk to him  do you want to do this or not  honey  honey he probably feels bad about  the president getting shot on his watch now stop reading the paper  shes obsessed  its the most interest that girls ever had in a book depository  mccann is buying ppl  and is absorbing sterling cooper along with it  what  conrad hilton told me this morning  christ from one johns bed to the next  what a joke  don and i have been discussing the idea that we buy the company back   really why  because we dont want to go to mccann  and now youre sniffing around because i have a golden pork chop dangling from my neck  its more than that   you know berts done for  now its about bert huh  i want to see what you look like with your tail between your legs  you sold your birthright so you could marry that trollop  here we go this is your pitch  well move along  im not gonna throw it all away because he doesnt want to work at mccann  do you want to work there  you dont value what i do anymore than they do  i was wrong i learned that with hilton  i can sell ideas but im not an account man  youre not good at relationships because you dont value them  i value my relationship with you   you do now  i do  im sorry ive got points stock  if im useless so be it  theres a deck chair somewhere with my name on it  youre right roger  if youve lost your appetite you should retire  of course ive seen that before so have you  men my age even younger  they play golf  go on vacation  lose their appetite   in three years  join or die  jesus bert he was doing better   you know its true  youre still gonna outlive me  we have to try  so you do want to be in advertising after all  go upstairs   daddy just got home  ill be up  do you want me to go too  please sit down  i made an appointment with a divorce attorney  and i suggest you do the same  come on betts   what are you doing seeing a lawyer  i want to be civilized about this   please dont act surprised  you havent been yourself  maybe you need to see a doctor a good one this time  because id have to be sick to want out of this  youve had a tough couple of weeks  we all have  ive had a tough year  i felt i should tell you rather than just let you get a phone call at work  well forget it  im not gonna let you break up this family  i didnt break up this family  lane please shut the door and have a seat  certainly  we know mccann erickson bought ppl  and we know that makes sterling cooper chattel  who told you that  someone outside of this building who knows  well theyre wrong  lane weve worked next to each other for a year  dont act like a stranger weve got tea  well i suppose youll find out soon enough  but your information isnt completely correct  only sterling cooper is being sold   ppl well will remain ppl  that doesnt change our plans  we want to buy back the company  were willing to offer the purchase price plus 12  its worth more than that now   what did you get  im not going to say but more than that  i apologize you had to find out this way  believe me it wasnt my decision  ive quite enjoyed it here  well theyve only got me for a year  you for what three  well make another run at it  the only grounds for divorce in this state  are absence of a spouse incurable insanity life imprisonment or adultery  well he hasnt been faithful  do you have any witnesses or corroboration  not really  it wouldnt matter anyway with both parties at fault   nno we havent we arent  ken ken what are you doing  you think the governor needs another scandal on the ticket  i am sorry for presuming mrs draper that was wrong  so what do i do  i know its hard to understand  but the state of new york doesnt want anyone to get divorced  thats why people go to reno  its painless  i met my second wife  you stay there for six weeks to establish residency  mr draper doesnt even need to go just consent  i see  we need to discuss what you want in terms of settlement  whatever im entitled to  give us a second  you dont need what he can provide  henry i have three children  ill take care of them and ill take care of you  i dont want you owing him anything  we want to get this done as soon as possible  saint john im glad i caught you  what is it  mr sterling cooper and draper have learned of the sale  what do they know  it was a mixture of truth and half truth  they knew about mccann but they were under the belief  that ppl was being sold as well   and what did you tell them  that they were wrong  they even wanted to bid for sterling cooper  our purchase price  listen i apologize lane  obviously the news is getting out   what news  ppl is being sold as well   what why wasnt i told  didnt seem pertinent  trying to keep our company calm as well as theirs   well wheres my place in this  with mccann i suppose  there there lane they know youre  essential to the transition   and then what  youll prove yourself irreplaceable  you always do  lane  yes  dont be disheartened  ill put in a good word for you   thank you  no thank you  weve got a month till winter then well be set  this is what i showed the man from the bank today  what are they gonna do sell this place  the banks gonna get their payday right after me  we got nothing and were about to have less  fine  ill sell ill

its done   youre not even gonna ask  i did yesterday  and you were right ppl is being sold  so it seems were all going to mccann  they cut you loose  i want you to find out what the price was and give us a shot  enough  i should fire you for even trying  to involve me in this conspiracy  go ahead its the only thing you did well here   don let it go  i did a great many things here  have another its 930 for gods sake  jes thats right  you have absolute authority to fire anyone  fire us  fire us sever our contracts let us go   can you do that  why would i  because once this sale goes through
