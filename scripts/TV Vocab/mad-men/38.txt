                previously on mad men  i wanted you to come to me   and why is that  because youre married   so youre missing here  are you asking if i miss you   whats your name  it used to be dick whitman  i didnt want to go to her wedding but i did  the least you can do is not come to mine  youre not even giving jane a chance  i wanna take you in that bedroom  and give you a go round like you never had  i wanted to inform you that  youre now the head of accounts  excuse me  were making you head of accounts  spectacular      mr campbell  mr campbell  ive got your hot cocoa  wonderful  i just got back from lunch and mr pryce wants to see you   its instant  its from the diner  i dont know how you can tell  you can tell because they use water instead of milk  its warmer outside its ridiculous  the building will take care of it they always do  sorry about that  this really is hitting the spot  come in  have a seat  i believe i have what is rather disappointing news  its been decided that mr cosgrove  will be made senior vice president  in charge of account services and  you will be made head of account management  really  this is not to  ignore that youve  distinguished yourself and been  of great service to the company  what is it based on  our billings are neck and neck  in fact i think ive done a lot  with what i was given in this arbitrary scheme  its become apparent that you are excellent at making the clients feel   their needs are being met but mr cosgrove has the rare gift  of making them feel as  if they havent any needs   i see  i improved your title  and you tell your clients therell  be no need to be deprecating   bert and toger know about this  this is under my authority  and i have to commend you on taking it as well as you have  i hope this was a difficult decision  it was  there you go   where are you going  i dont feel well  why did you pick that place i dont know why a lunch counter is   any better than eating at your desk  well you couldve joined me for a drink  i can drink at my desk if i  want to and im not out 125  im sorry im not asstimulating a lunch companion as doug  its duck and i work most lunches  well i dont like his aftershave  i can smell it on you and i can smell it in the bathroom in the morning  whats wrong with him  nothing i dont even know why im weighing in on men right now  i think its good that youre

actually have to get involved  what does it mean its not good  i know its not good  theres no future for me her  how did you do it  you made your job u  i didnt i looked at other agencies  saw that they had tv departments  and wondered why we didnt  oh theres no such thing in the accounts field  theres marketing  thats a research job  is this official  yes  im afraid we cant hire mr charcot  well at least you had the guts to send me a memo  hes far too expensive  salvatore romano is gone  there is no one in charge of the art department  i havent heard a complaint from any of the clients  jesus its hotter in here than in my office  thats because youre overexcited  do you want me to walk you through a delivery schedule  this is walter cronkite in our newsroom  and there has been an attempt as perhaps you know now  on the life of president kennedy  he was wounded in an automobile driving from dallas airport  into downtown dallas along with governor connally of texas  theyve been taken to parkland hospital there where their condition  is as yet unkn  my god how much have you been smoking in here  sorry about that  im uh glad you ran over  me too  i dont understand  i cant run my department without an art director  do you want to call saint john  bert cooper still has a say around here  hello what  if they wanted to fire you they wouldve fired you  im gonna die at this desk unnoticed  do you have any idea what ive done for this company   what are you doing  they shot the president  what   top of the presidents car was down they drew their pistols  but the damage was done the president was slumped over  in the back seat of the car face down  then governor connally after slumping to the left for a moment  lay on the floor of the rear seats  oh my god   dear god  is he dead  what the hell is going on  every person listening at this moment has flashed back  to that day in april 1945 when franklin delano roosevelt  excuse me chet here is a flash from the associated press  dateline dallas  two priests who were with president kennedy say he is dead  of bullet wounds  there is no further confirmation but this is what we have  is he okay  they just said he died  two priests in dallas who were with president kennedy  say he is dead of bullet wounds   oh lord  there is no further confirmation  this is the only word we have indicating the president may  in fact have lost his life  it has just moved on the associated press wires from dallas  the two priests were called to the hospital to administer the last rites   oh my goodness  i know  and it is from them we get the word that the president has died  that the bullet wounds  inflicted on him as he rode   in a motorcade through downtown dallas have been fatal  we would remind you there is no official confirmation of this from  any source as yet  bill just moments before you brought the flash i had  word from the hospital  that the vice president lyndon johnson and his wife had just left the hospital  been rushed away into a motor  did you give me a hickey   i dont think so  i told you i dont like that  i get questions from my mother  listen there was a news story that was on right before you came in  its been distracting me  you didnt seem distracted  i just want to see whats going on  whats going on   it was only on october the  to the united nations adlai stevenson  was assaulted in dallas leaving a dinner meeting there  from dallas texas the flash apparently official  president kennedy died at    jesus  oh my god  what happened  vice president lyndon johnson has left the hospital in dallas  ive gotta call my kids  we do not know to where he has proceed  presumably he will be taking the oath of office shortly  and become the 36th president of the united  president johnson is under heavy guard  its ruined  its over  its gonna be ruined  fiveyear old boy and myself were by ourselves on the grass there on palmer street  and i asked joe to wave to him  betts  wheres your mother  shes not feeling well  i cant stop crying  why are the kids watching this  what am i supposed to do don  am i supposed to keep it from them  take a pill and lie down  i can handle the kids  turn this off ill make us some dinner  a polaroid picture taken by another witness  mary norman of dallas showing the president slumped over in the car  just as mary started to take the picture the president came  right even with us two shots  you two look at me  two shots rang out and he grabbed his chest  everything is going to be okay  we have a new president and were all gonna be sad for a little bit  and then on monday theres gonna be a funeral  are we going to the funeral   shots rang out but by that time the motorcade had sped away   fair play for cuba  a procastro organization where he had been arrested  on disturbance of the peace charges  he denied he was a communist  said he was a marxist and claimed there was quite a difference  between the two police in dallas  have just announced  you should get ready its almost 200  really don   gunpowder traces on both hands  indicating hed recently used a rifle  the type of weapon that killed mr kennedy yesterday  as we told you a short time ago oswald has refused  hes 24 years old  in washington the body of the late president  lies in the east room of the white house  come on betts  are you sure they havent canceled it  it said in the times  they were doing that  im not gonna call roger to find out  if we go in and its off well grab dinner or something  i cant sit in front of the tv all day  fine  just stay here until carla comes  after the terrible news had reached us  can you see bags  i dont understand this  and here we are  lyndon johnson more of the same  nobody voted for him  it felt for a second like everything was about to change  you should get your coat and your scarf  i know its far but i really feel like walking  why are we going  because its your bosss daughters wedding  its business pete and there a system you always say that  its one thing to go to this wedding and act like i dont hate them  its another thing to go and act like the president hasnt been murdered  maybe theyll cancel it but we have to show   have you been drinking  the whole countrys drinking  and not to celebrate some spoiled brats wedding  we are mourning together with his widow  theyll never cancel  you know why  because theyre happy  you shouldve heard some of the things people said yesterday  like what what did they say  the man made a lot of enemies things like that  thats awful  i dont care what your politics are this is america  you dont just shoot the president  chet huntley was talking about jackie and those kids  how she just lost that baby and harry crane was  looking at his paperwork calculating how many commercials werent going to be aired  im not going  you can go and say im sick if you think its that important   demonstrates the internal threat that can never be underestimated  no youre right  our sympathy for the kennedy family  is no less that it is for the millions of people who have sustained   equal losses in the fight for freedom  i got a call from leona this girl i used to work with at the phone company  my friend francine called me  don couldnt get through  the system was completely overloaded  its annoying that people think the operators were watching tv  they were as frustrated as anyone  the maitre d has reorganized the seating  if you are at an evennumbered table take these first six  if you are at an oddnumbered table the left side of the room  maestro do you mind  thank you  look everybody grab your plate and come on up to the front here  sit wherever you feel like  and please feel free to have the prime rib and the fillet of sole

set aside to  to host  im going out  where  for a drive  let me drive  ill get the kids well all go somewhere   thats a good idea  no   i need to clear my head  im so glad you could see me  where does

believe you  i cant believe anything right now  have you thought that there are other ways to live  listen im not in love with  the tragedy of this thing  its not romeo and juliet  i want it to happen

movies right now  some theater thats playing your favorite movie  singing in the rain  well just think about that  it was made possible by a special equipment  it will move at one fourth speed  so we would like to show you in slow motion the shooting of lee harvey oswald now  they just stood there  no security for the most wanted man in america  he didnt even have a trial  just throw him over the mob  you can see the two detectives  one in a light suit one in a dark  bringing oswald out  the camera changes its length for a close up of oswald  the shot has been fired you cannot  hear it in this version of the tape  oswald falls and the man with the hat moves in on him and hes grabbed by the man in light  do not go in to work tomorrow  no of course not  its a national day of mourning  youre going to go on tuesday  thats another happy thought  those people dont care about you  and honestly whats the difference  what are you saying  you did everything they asked you to do but  you dont owe them anything  you should start gathering your clients  theyll follow you wherever you go  the only other president buried there is william howard taft  though of course there are many  other heroes of perhaps lesser renown  francine has the kids  i dont know where to begin  what  i want  to scream at you  for ruining all of this  but  then you try to fix it and  theres no point  theres no point don  youre very upset i understand  i know its painful  but its going to pass  i dont love you  betts dont  youre distraught  its true  but i dont love you anymore  i know that  stop it  i kissed you
