                mad men 2x13 meditations in an emergency  mrs draper sorry about the chill in here  but my wife took the oil heater upstairs  im fine  so as i thought last week  the spotting was not caused by your horseback riding  but rather as i suspected  youre going to have another baby  really  weve been here before  youll have to start eating right sleeping  avoid strenuous activity no riding  just take it easy  thats what husbands are for  i cant believe this  i understand this was a surprise but blessings come that way  of course  ill need you to undress  so i can examine you  dr aldridge  are you sure  are you concerned about your appearance  youve been blessed with a very resilient figure  i cant have a baby right now  mrs draper if were having the conversation  i think were having  there are alternatives obviously  but i find it hard to believe that  as a married woman of means you would even be considering that  that is an option for young girls  who have no other options  i guarantee  the minute you tell your husband your friends  youll stop worrying  get in the swing of things  lets see if i can wrestle that heater from charlene  with love from ken cosgrove and pete campbell  whyd you need it today  cooper wanted the ad revenue projections early  why  great clearasil is missing  honestly i dont know  you dont think its anything to do with draper being awol in california do you  no i figured that out  campbell says theres an aerospace gold rush  i bet drapers landing a big one  i havent heard anything  or hes breaking off opening his own shop in la  or hes finding a good spot  for sterling cooper west  id love to go to california i could get a convertible  whatever it is theyre evaluating us  if kennedys speech goes past 830 thats lucy and then danny thomas  then andy griffith ill take it in the shorts  why am i sick to my stomach  good youre here  im waiting on a call from north american aviation  its 10 there they should just be getting

everybody had to turn in their numbers early  what am i gonna say to duck  that my fatherinlaw hates me  pete just tell the truth  dont worry about the outcome  people respect that  thank you  i dont want you blaming creative  how long have you been here  half an hour  i didnt want to bother you  where have you been  you disappeared  i had to have some time to think about things  must be nice

 clearasil is pulling out  sales are strong creative is strong  but we are not suited for business together  your fatherinlaw  thats a sticky wicket  indeed  im working on something to replace it  campbell im counting on your discretion here  the british agency putnam powell  lowe  is taking a controlling share of sterling cooper  clearasil is in conflict with lever brothers  were merging well being merged with  your loyalty and enthusiasm during the american airlines thing  showed real character  thank you  id like you to replace me as head of accounts  im trusting you with this

news has to be broken the right way  is don on board with my promotion  im the president i dont need his permission do i  right  if don shows up hell fall in line  hell have to or find another profession  thats why god put noncompete clauses in contracts  thank you  good evening my fellow citizens  this government as promised  has maintained the closest surveillance  of the soviet military buildup  on the island of cuba  within the past week  unmistakable evidence has established the fact  that a series of offensive missile sites  is now in preparation  on that imprisoned island  the purpose of these bases  can be none other  than to provide a nuclear strike capability  against the western hemisphere  upon receiving the first preliminary hard information  of this nature  last tuesday morning at 9 am  i directed that our surveillance be stepped up  and having now confirmed   gave the soviet union  for supplying cuba in this new military buildup  and asked russia to stop arming castros cuba  the president did not order a direct military action   welcome back  hildy  youre a sight for sore eyes  hello joan its good to be back  how are you  like everyone else today very distracted  hello peggy  you look well how was california  sunny  do i work for you now  i hope its okay mr sterling gave me permission to switch  i landed the popsicle account  so other than her office and haircut  is there anything new i need to know about  after you  the world continues without us  theres no reason to take it personally  do you want to know if youve been missed  thats half your correspondence  mr sterling has been very anxious  to speak to you on a daily basis  and mr phillips of course  ill need the copywriters and sal in here to get me up to speed  call roger in a half an hour  and tell him ill meet him in a half an hour  and mr phillips  maybe ill run into him in the mens room  i sent your paychecks home i assume youve spoken to mrs draper   did she call  not today  i think thats enough to start  we have a safety protocol for civil defense  i dont want to start a panic but i think people have the right to know  trust me i dont think therell be a point  in taking those stairs or diving under a desk  so youre back  what happened  one minute im standing next to you in the carport  and the next im tap dancing for general dynamics  sorry i missed that  i cant drive its amazing i made any meetings at all  but you did  of course i did  did you ever think id left you there because i thought you could handle it  how did it go  im this close to north american aviation  then i was right wasnt i  you handled it  good work  i know you want everything the minute you want it  sometimes its better to wait until youre ready  so you think im ready  you proved it  now i have to play a little catchup ball  of course  welcome back don   you wanted to see me  about three weeks ago  hope you were looking for a job in california  because youre going to need one  ill stack my absences up against yours any day  you cant just do that  it was important  and from what i can see the walls are still standing  they are  but we sold them  and the rest of the company to putnam powell  lowe  what  its done theyre coming in friday  to discuss strategy management structure and logistics  youll find one of these buried in a stack of crap on your desk  so how

he doesnt have a wife  any conflicts  well mona hasnt been pleasant since my engagement  no with the deal  but congratulations  thank you  very few conflicts  coop and alice jumped on it  i wasnt going to make trouble  now you can go back to your office  and figure out how much i made on this  i guess so  kennedys daring them to bomb us  right when i got a second chance  we dont know whats really going on you know that  as mr khrushchev and mr castro  push our leadership towards the threat of nuclear war  it is tempting to be angry  but i urge all of you to remember  that even on the cross  jesus forgave his transgressors  and although we cannot control these frightening events  let us take charge of our own souls  and let us prepare ourselves  for the most important summit meeting of all  and so we pray  we are all sinners  every one of us  but at least  give us the courage  and the common sense  to admit it  to confess it  and to repair it  and give us the assurance that  when this temporary life on earth ends  we will be welcomed back into your arms  in your heavenly kingdom  amen   amen  amen  shes awfully quiet  i think i know what thats about  shes terrified like the rest of us  i think shes being smug because she has a bomb shelter  really  i dont even like to go in the subway theres no air  i prefer you stop talking about this  youre upsetting my

something fix it  i came in to get away from this speculation  damn it you see what you did  i hope the soviets got a guy like you to build those missiles  everyones looking at each other in the

that father  but youre upsetting me right now  that is your guilt peggy  all that god wants is for you to reconcile with him  dont dont you understand  that this could be the end of the world and you could go to hell  i cant believe thats the way god is  good night father  really  the silver  there could be looting  a mob is going to come to the 14th floor of this apartment building  i wish you would come with me right now  what if something happens  rehoboth beach is 90 minutes from dc  you dont understand these bombs  your parents deck chairs will be on fifth avenue  are you trying to make me more upset  if for some reason the train doesnt work  just take a few hundred dollars in cash and pay someone to drive you  this is ridiculous  if im going to die i want to die in manhattan  stop that kind of talk peter  theres no difference and i want to be here  and you want to be with your parents  why do you always make it about that  and yes i love my parents and they love me  do you  if you did youd want to be with me  youre right  ill help you pack the car  the first russian ship  that proceed through the area  patrolled by our navy forces  bad news  what  the conference rooms signed out all day  and i checked the fridge  theres canaps really good ones  they shampooed the carpets last night  ppls coming in today  you told me she told you that  youre not worried whyd you come in  i dont know im just waiting to see what happens  i talked to my fatherinlaw about it  regime change is always tricky  you want to stay neutral  the loyalists are always hung  and you dont want to get caught in the fallout  whats wrong with you  arent you loyal to anyone  they dont care about us  were just a bunch of salaries on a ledger  theyll draw a line and get rid of everything below it  i like this company the way it is  have a minute  from the look of this that might be all i have  may i  im coming to you anonymously don  i know something i think you should know  what  i know about the merger  and i know that duck phillips is going to be the president  how do you know that  he told me  why would he do that  picking sides i guess  why are you telling me this  i dont know  i just thought if i was you  i would want to know  thank you  you know they stopped a ship this morning  i bet the russians are reconsidering now that we made a stand   carla whats this  thats from mr draper  dear betty  im sitting in the roosevelt looking at the backs of bobby and sallys heads  as they watch tv  im not letting them change the channel  because watching the news makes me sick  and they can see it  i think about you and how i behaved  and my regret  i know its my fault you are not here right now  i understand why you feel its better to go on without me  and i know that you wont be alone for very long  but without you  ill be alone forever  i love you  gentlemen now that weve done haggling over the dowry  its time to slip into the tent and spend a night with the bride  we imagine that sterling cooper  will remain some what autonomous  you bought us we dont expect autonomy  but whos going to be minding the store  when you all fly back to england  since weve worked with him before and he knows both companies  duck phillips will be president of sterling cooper  my goodness  obviously i accept  that makes sense  congratulations  well i promise in spite of this title  i will treat the founders of sterling cooper  with the respect they deserve  duck it has now become your meeting  tell us what you see  i find myself a little unprepared here  but i know this  id like to bring this company into financial maturity  the last two years weve been held back  good creative is important but it cant be running the show  our business is about buying time and space  and right now that means television  the bigger we are the cheaper we can get it  i dont think i heard the word client once  bert when the economy is good people buy things  and when its bad they dont  theres no reason for us to be tied to creatives fantasies of persuasion  it certainly is an amtious way of thinking about things  what  i think it sounds like a great agency  and i think duck is the man to run it  i just dont think ill be a part of it  you dont want to be a part of it  if this is the agency you want  duck is the man for the job  this is what im talking about  artistic temperament  don is this really necessary  it is  because he loves this room and hearing his own voice and saving the day  except this time hes got to get with a team  you can either honor your contract or walk out that door with nothing  and start selling insurance  i dont have a contract  were close  we didnt think we needed one  gentlemen  i sell products not advertising  i cant see as far into the future as duck  but if the world is still here on monday  we can talk  don hold on  let him go  take a second to find some kid  who can write a prose poem to a potato chip  calm down  let him throw his tantrum  the man disappeared for 3 damn weeks and i put this deal together  what more do you need to know  duck would you excuse us for a minute  of course  this doesnt affect the merger does it  he never could hold his liquor  your wife called she wants you to come home  you should go home as well  i cant even think right now  greg says they put st lukes on alert  your bag  i dont need it  good night   why are you smiling  because youre still here  i was hoping the train would be empty  have a drink with me  why are you still here trudy must be worried  what is it with you  what  you never let me talk about what i want to talk about  well what do you want to talk about  about what you said about the truth  can i tell you the truth  why wouldnt you  you make it so hard  what are you talking about  you  ive been thinking about everything thats going on  and i thought  whod care if i was gone  i mean trudy would care  but she doesnt know me  but you do  and i know you  and i think youre perfect  im not perfect pete  yes you are  and i wish i picked you then  i love you  and i want to be with you  what  didnt you know that  i could have had you in my life forever  if i wanted to  what do you mean  i could have had you  i could have shamed you into being with me  but i didnt want to  i dont understand  you got me pregnant  i had a baby  and i gave it away  what  i had your baby  and i gave it away  are you serious  you cant be serious  i wanted other things  i dont understand  one day youre there  and then all of a sudden  theres less of you  and you wonder where that part went  if its living somewhere outside of you  and you keep thinking  maybe youll get it back  and then you realize  its just gone  why would you tell me that  im sorry pete   daddy
