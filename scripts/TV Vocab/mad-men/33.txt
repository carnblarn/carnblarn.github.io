friends  kings that might counsel you better  i want you to handle the waldorf astoria  the new york hilton and the statler hilton  its just new york  but my eye has definitely started to wander  i think thats a good start  retainer et cetera thats for lawyers  everything else will be like this  having me in your life is gonna change things   i look forward to it  they always say that   a happy bunch  if you say so  young people give us energy dont forget that  ill take it from here  its not much to start with  but i look forward to sharing my dreams with you  speak to you soon  i cannot believe you just had a baby and you redid your house  are you suicidal   they were not supposed to be simultaneous  and the baby wasnt the one that couldnt keep a schedule  i assume this meeting means youre interested  in replacing francine as secretary   i am  good  because we waited for you for our most pressing business  the proposed  will not only drain the pleasantville road reservoir  but also blemish the natural and financial health of our community  well said  the junior league needs to take over this effort  and explain the issues  conservation  the silent spring  the majestic beauty of the hudson river valley  worthless real estate  second  on both sides of the river  because some industrial park on route 9 needs our water  we need to go over the village boards head appeal to the governor  the rockefellers own half the land here  real estate thats scary  i may know someone in the governors office  who  umm his name is henry  youre gonna have to do better than that  henry francis  hes in the paper sometimes  always right behind rocky  what does he do  im not really sure  how do you know him  i met him at a party for dons work  oh here he is oh my it just says advisor  oh yes i know who he is  he used to be the republican party chair  for westchester county  i know him  well call him then  i think we have a better chance  if betty calls  its not adorable to pretend like youre not adorable  hmm  call him  woman hes a big deal  woman  miami is where we should start let it grow from there  hoho wants it everywhere  he just bought land in seattle its an indoor city   as long as he keeps writing checks  look do you want to kill this thing in one blow  or do you want to shear the sheep every year  whatever you want don  you made it clear you dont want to talk about it  but at least tell us how you know him  we ran into each other at a party  thatll be all  i know roger will be the face of this thing  but i wouldnt mind doing the legwork  pete i think youre supposed to bring in the account  and im supposed to be to be on it  what happened with north american aviation  its going well  my friend russ who deals with mcnamaras office  said the orders are through the roof  for helicopters carbines and especially jets for vietnam  i think ive convinced north american  theyre going to need to spend more  if they want to get out of nasa and into the pentagon  when they do  we can talk about hilton  understood  betty oh no yes of course  hes busy  its wilson48038  betty draper  he can call me anytime  its a civic matter regarding ossining  thank you  lunch  wash your hands bobby  draper residence  mrs draper its henry francis  yes of course  i appreciate you getting back to me so quickly  stop it  could you hold just a moment   im going to get on the extension  of course  im going in the study hang up the phone  damn it   what is wrong with you  you said to hang up the phone  after i pick up the phone  freeze   draper residence  its henry again   we were disconnected  im sorry about that  my son  i know how that goes how are you  you must have had your baby by now  yes i did you remembered   what did you have  a little boy  can you get him registered by november  i just realized everyone who calls you must want something  actually ive been doing most of the calling lately  what can i do for you  well we were hoping you could stop  the destruction of the pleasantville road reservoir   whos we  im representing the junior league  of tarrytown  they want to build a 3milliongallon water tank   and its a very scenic area  i know the area  well its practically the governors backyard  thats true but i grew up there as well   really where  mount salem  im heading upstate tomorrow afternoon  maybe i could stop by and take a look  well tomorrow is saturday  of course work every day  i forget other people dont  no  this is very important to me  i think i could find the time  is swensons bakery still there  it is and it has an air conditioner  ill buy you a cup of coffee  and then we can take a hike to the reservoir   is 300 too late for you  no its perfect   ill make it work  well ill see you then mrs draper  i can save you the trouble  its from him and its expensive  im going to fire her  what did you promise him   who  youre thick do you know that  that present its from duck  hermes nice  i hope yours is a different color  elegance and success duck  i wonder who wrote that for him   i dont trust him  why  because he wants us were very important here  who is  did he put you on hilton  i dont know what youre talking about  stop barging in here and infecting me with your anxiety  this is really beautiful  he sent me a box of cuban cigars  although im starting to think theyre not that hard to come by  hilton hotels did we get that  do you live in a cave  conrad hilton came to see don this morning   he was right there  really   what was he like  i only got a quick look at him  he was skinny like a cowboy  my mother gave me his book  hes catholic  its going to be a huge account  not as big as lucky strike  but it would be nice to be planning a little offense for once  instead of hiding from the ftc   he has a book  i really like this  look im keeping this  duck said were not tied together  ill keep my mouth shut and you do whatever you want  do you know why duck doesnt work here anymore  because don squeezed him out when the british took over  so what don didnt like him  its the world against don and now its someone else  true but duck would love to hit don where it hurts  well im not going anywhere  and im not going to tell don  im not worried about you im worried about duck  send it back  when were you going to tell us about this  i thought id let it be an incoming phone call  and then wait and see who took credit for it  this is very exciting  despite its modest billings  london is thrilled  with hiltons potential for international growth   finally  huzzah  if you dont mind my asking how did you make this happen  we travel in the same circles  well i dont know if we should celebrate yet  his lawyers called and theres a little matter of the contract  well dont be afraid to push back  i agreed to the new york hotels  but everything else should be under our terms  i dont think you understand  this is regarding your contract  or lack thereof  lane it may seem like a formality to you  but to mr hilton its a necessity that  all the principals in the firm be secured  and honestly i cant blame him  ill give him my word  and hell take it  but his lawyers wont  obviously youll want  your attorney to look it over  thats ben michelson hmm  its fairly standard  three years a noncompete clause a healthy raise  thats very generous  ill think about it  im confused  if someone handed me that contract id be filled with glee  a threeyear guarantee  a 5000 signing bonus  i ive never seen that before  well we want to take care of him  look ive gotten to know conrad hilton a little bit  and i think hell enjoy something he cant have  and you should tell him that it matters to me  it matters to him  still i dont think anyone told him that it matters to me  well this is the way it has to be  and not just for conrad hilton but for sterling cooper  id like you to take those papers home for the weekend  and think about that  id be happy to  ah  i met him once hes a bit of an eccentric isnt he  yes  oh  oh jesus   mrs draper  mr francis  im alone i hope thats okay  oh well actually my friend couldnt get away either  i appreciate your coming up  please i love coming back here  so much changes so much doesnt  like what im interested   woman can i help you  just an ice tea please  thats fine for now   what was i saying  you were talking about coming back here  ossining has always been a real mix of people  well after living in manhattan it wasnt my first choice  but its grown on me  i lived in manhattan when i was married  its okay for work  but i cant sleep with all those people on top of me  like in a skyscraper  may i have a straw  so you have your folder  i thought id just  give you the literature and a copy of the petition  i dont know that im a great spokesman  you dont have to tell me how beautiful the reservoir is  i used to do jackknives into it  we drink that water  ive looked into this for you  and im afraid its underway  oh no were too late  maybe if you knew somebody with some clout  i dont even know what you do  im a classic strategist fundraiser  maybe campaign manager im waiting on that  and how do you become that  give a lot of money  no no im a lawyer  but i dont use it much  we all have skills we dont use  i was an anthropology major  imagine that  where  bryn mawr  well you may be saving your community right

way  i dont know what i can do about the water tank  oh  dont give up so easily  suzanne what this really is is a camera obscura  we call it a sun scope  and it allows us to look at the eclipse  without injury to our eyes   i didnt bring a scissor  i have scissors  and squares of cardboard that already have pinholes in them  and if you really need some help  ask your dads  the eclipse is   gentlemen start your engines  i could have gone golfing  i had no idea this is what wed be in for  go ahead ill take ernie home  you know francine taught school when we were first married  i used to

you but i have to be on my way  oh thats too bad  i have to be in albany for dinner  his masters voice the governor  its an old ad  i know what it is   what are you doing  its the eclipse  he made a contraption  dont look at it  are you okay  i think so  i feel a little dizzy  take a deep breath  is that better  so you never had time to go to the reservoir anyway  i only had an hour but i figured
