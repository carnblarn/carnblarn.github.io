thought that samsonite is this very rare element  this mythical substance the hardest on earth  and we see an adventurer leaping through a cave  is this a substance much like bullshit  i thought we could drop one off the eiffel tower with a countdown  like the moon shot and show how it doesnt break  but it would wouldnt it probably  the government has prohibited us from doing things like that peggy  they feel that it is not in the public interest  we have a thing with samson because hes strong and his hair  i gave you more responsibility and you didnt do anything  that you like we did work a lot  i dont care if you work 10 seconds if you bring me something i like  were going to do this right now  i know you have plans  you were going to call me from a bar with an idea  you think elves

greatest not if you have to say it  muhammad ali  do you like the airplane  liston just goes about his business works methodically  clay will dance and talk throw a few until hes wiped out  a bag

idea  maybe theres something to the elephant  do you want one  im sorry do you have someplace to be  maybe tap your foot so i get the message  i was supposed to be at dinner an hour ago its my birthday  and im pretty sure i ruined everything  why the hell didnt you tell me  i dont know because i thought this would take a second  so now im supposed to feel like crap  im so sick that i ruined

anything nice for you  jesus you even sound like my mother  im already into this place for 40  if you dont mind im going to enjoy my dinner  and you enjoy your work  the fact that you would stay there  you know what  forget it  no what  you want to do this right now  do what  fine its been nice knowing you happy birthday  so thats it  yup good night  hello  itll be fine couples fight ask gerry  whats wrong elevator out  i think i just broke up with mark  really  i think so  so go home  nope im ready to work you win again  you couldve just told me it was your birthday  right and thered be no repercussions  so now this is my fault  well its not my fault you dont have a family or friends  or anywhere else to go  go go run to him like in the movies you dont have to be here  i do have to be here  because of some stupid idea from danny who you had to hire  because you stole his other stupid idea because you were drunk  dont get personal because you didnt do your work  and by the way i know it kills you but guess what  there is no dannys idea  everything that comes in here belongs to the agency  you mean you  as long as you still work here  is that a threat  because ive already taken somebody up on one of those tonight  relax  you know what heres a blank piece of paper  why dont you turn that into glocoat  are you out of your mind  you gave me 20 ideas and i picked out one of them  that was a kernel that became that commercial  so you remember  i do it was something about a cowboy congratulations  no it was something about a kid locked in a closet  because his mother was making him wait for the floor to dry  which is basically the whole commercial  its a kernel  which you changed just enough so that it was yours  i changed it into a commercial  what are we going to shoot him in the dark in the closet  thats the way it works there are no credits on commercials  but you got the clio  its your job  i give you money you give me ideas  and you never say thank you  thats what the money is for  youre young you will get your recognition  and honestly it is absolutely ridiculous  to be two years into your career and counting your ideas  everything to you is an opportunity  and you should be thanking me every morning when you wake up  along with jesus for giving you another day  come on  im sorry about your boyfriend okay  may 25th ideas for samsonite  toughness means that  peggy get in here  no come on  you have to come in here right now  what do you want  you have to hear this sit down  come on sit  so this is tape number 4 of sterlings gold  by roger sterling  so where was i  bert cooper hated me and i thought it was because  he thought i d be an ally of my father  but it turned out it was something to do with my joie de vivre  my romantic prowess  see tape 3  including some time with the queen of perversions  his secretary ida blankenship  you know what dont use her name  but it was all about him hating my very youth  all because the poor guy had been out down in the height of his sexual prime  by an unnecessary orchiectomy  lyle evans m d i think he had him killed  anyway sometime in the summer of 48 no 1932  no 1939  why are you laughing its like reading someones diary  come on ida was a hellcat cooper lost his balls  rogers writing a book  i should go stay and visit  ive got nothing to say  sure you do  no its personal  we have personal conversations  no we dont and i think you like it that way i know i do  suit yourself  were supposed to be staring at each other over candlelight  and he invites my mother  he doesnt know me its not my fault  i guess im back to square one single  well as danny would say theres no use crying over fish in the sea  mouse  over there  what are you doing  get the suitcase  why  im gonna seal it up in my nice samsonite and throw it off the roof  dont  come on every idea you have is some version of that  lets do it whered you go mickey  i think its a rat  its a mouse i grew up on a farm  you know what  theres a way out of this room we dont know about  are you okay  i think thats yours  its probably mark i dont want to answer it  its still your birthday let me get you dinner  whats the most exciting thing about a suitcase  going somewhere  the acropolis  id like to go to greece i hear all the good cooks stayed there  id like to just go on a plane ive never been  is that right  ive heard about it obviously ive seen it in the movies  its an incredible idea flying  i remember on the way to korea  they told us how many thousand feet in the air we were  there was some other kid there more of a yokel than me even  and he screamed man wasnt meant to fly  cooper has no testicles  i dont want water  my uncle max said he had a suitcase that was always packed  he said a man has to be ready to go at any moment  jesus maybe its a metaphor  theres something to that idea  i dont know  i cant tell the difference anymore between something thats good  and something thats awful  well theyre very close  but the best idea always wins and you know it when you see it  keep banging your head against the wall then it happens  and then its done  yes maam  not like everything else in my life  i mean i know what im supposed to want but it just never feels right  or as important as anything in that office  i didnt know you were in korea very briefly  did you shoot anybody nope  i saw some people get killed thats memorable  my father died right in front of me heart attack i was 12  sorry to hear that  it was pretty violent the tv was on thats why i hate sports  nobody was around saturday afternoon my mother was shopping  i saw my father die too he was kicked by a horse  youre kidding  what about your mother  i never knew her  why is there a dog in the parthenon  that is a roach lets go someplace darker  i hate dating im terrible at it  youll find someone you know youre cute as hell  men dont exactly stop and stare in the streets  do you want that thats not what you were supposed to say  what do you care what i think  everybody thinks i slept with you to get the job  they joke about it  like its so funny because the possibility was so remote  its not because you arent attractive  i have to keep rules about work i have to  youre an attractive girl peggy  not as attractive as some of your other secretaries i guess  you dont want to start giving me morality lessons do you  people do things right  my mother thinks you were responsible  because you were the only person who visited me in the hospital  jesus really she hates you  do you know who it was  of course i do  do you ever think about it  i try not to  but then it comes up out of nowhere  playgrounds  heres cassius clay starting to put up a fight  get up  get up  come on get up  get up
