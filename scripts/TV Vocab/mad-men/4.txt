a lot of friends in the city  there was poker and tennis  drinks at the river club  turned out none of them were men  im im sorry  i really just meant tonight what happened  please i figure i might as well say it  thats what youve all been guessing anyway right  we havent all been doing anything  okay  the strangest part of it is that  i think hes angrier at me than i am at him  of course my father got a lawyer  an army buddy who just hammered the hell out of him  ive always loved that house  hello  he has to go right upstairs  and have complete quiet for a while  he works so hard  i should get

making it out to the house this summer  well try im not sure ill be able  to take the time off from work  work  i still dont understand what you do  id hate for you to miss the blackberrys  run into you at the club youre working  at a restaurant youre working  taking people out to dinner  wining and whoring  no job for a white man  shes made such a nice addition to the table  so nice and appreciative  theres a lot more to it than that  advertising really  see if someone were to tell me  theres a lot more to the law id believe them  i cant explain how business works to you  trudy found an apartment that she likes  did she where abouts   are you sure you want to be that far uptown  its not that far dad  it falls off after 79th  no darling  they fall off after 86th  its a very nice area  it is  and well  its actually kind of expensive  so  were going to need help with the down payment  really  yes  no i dont think thats a good idea  and why is that  i just dont think its a good idea  you thought it was a good idea to help bud when  he hit that girl on her bike in montauk last summer  what did that cost  i presume its your profession  that is responsible for this lapse in your manners  ill pay you back  its not about the money peter  you know that  why is it so hard for you people to give me anything  we gave you everything  we gave you your name  and what have you done with it  did you have a nice visit  theyre very keen on us coming out  to fishers island this summer  can they help with the apartment  i didnt bring it up  my dads been having some health problems  sweetheart  whats wrong with him  nobody knows  walter hows it going  never had much luck  unless im playing against campbell here  hes known for losing gracefully  you know our director salvatore romano  did you have a good time in the city last night  when i come into town  i like to just do my business and go home  unwind with the psalms  no man should have to live out of a suitcase  what do you fellows have for me  well  we take for granted  the things we need the most water oil electricity  steel  i was thinking about the last time you were here  looking out this window at this  incredible city and saying  its all steel  new york city  brought to you by bethlehem steel  city of pittsburgh  brought to you by bethlehem steel  city of chicago detroit  st louis  full page ads in targeted markets  newspapers trade publications  throw in a few billboards  so your employees can brag to their girlfriends  theyre kind of plain arent they  reminds of those wpa ads before the war  walter youve been doing this long enough  you know we could throw this artwork away in a minute  but the sentiment the idea  its so basic you feel like you already know it  you just havent thought of it lately  cities are made of steel  bethlehem steel  i might be wrong but these  feel like ads for cities  youre making our company look like  a middleman for another product  well would you prefer  an ibeam on a plate  with a pat of butter on it  no need to get cute don   just making a point  steel is not something  that you can buy at the supermarket  but it is a commodity  im surprised  i believe this is fairly close to what we had talked about  we talked about a national strategy  that would involve the virtues of this essential commodity  i believe it was more specific  walter has expressed himself now walter  if this does not meet your expectations  im sure don can find something that does  right don  i hate to be a pain in the ass  but if they didnt just lay there so flat  i dont know maybe its because  im not from a city  they just  bother me  look if we can persuade you to stay in town another 24 hours  back at the saint regis of course  it would give us a chance to come up with something with more impact  get you tickets to a broadway show  theres a new one byebye birdie  i dont like birds either  well something else then  pete i think sal can show mr blythe out walt  sorry about that they are good drawings  no the wpa was a very respected style   what the hell was that  come on don  thats not the first time someones been unhappy  give it a haircut  hes a second time guy anyway i could feel that  and i could feel he was sentences away  im that kind of guy  he didnt like the idea  someone hadnt prepared him to like the idea  an idea he was extremely enthusiastic about three months ago  im sorry i didnt lower his expectations enough  you do your job take him sailing  get him in a bathing suit leave the ideas to me  i have ideas  im sure you do  sterling cooper has more failed artists  and intellectuals than the third reich  you know what i have good ideas  in fact i used to carry around a notebook and a pen just to keep track  direct marketing i thought of that  turned out it already existed but i arrived at it independently  and then i come to this place  and you people tell me that im good with people which is strange  because id never heard that before  draper residence  betty helen bishop are you busy   no im just finishing up dinner  of course  listen this may be truly rude but  i was wondering  im supposed to be stuffing envelopes at kennedy headquarters tonight  and my sitter just canceled and  i hate to back out because well  you know new york state is so important  i didnt know that  anyway i was wondering if you could come over  and watch the kids for a few hours  right now  you know what i shouldnt of asked  well let me just get dinner on the table  i guess don can watch the kids  really  gosh that would be wonderful take your time  youre a lifesaver truly  i cant tell you how much i appreciate this  hiroshima i know  cleaning lady and babysitter are one  stop  its charming  thats beautiful glen  except he could wake the baby glen stop that now  you remember mrs draper  shes going to take care of you while im gone  no ironing  ironing  i give him five cents a piece he loves doing it  there you are  i swear to god i am so exhausted  when i get home from the jewelry store that i just  kick these off and i never know where they end up  you glen bishop in bed after the real mccoys no discussions  you look very nice  i keep the place poorly lit  i guess therell be a lot of nice men there  yes i guess so although its mostly women  have you seen the candidate  on the news hes handsome  but im not sure who were voting for  ill bring you back some literature  ill be back before 1000 i promise  you gotta get that lux soap campaign over to sterling cooper  janet leigh and natalie wood  now theres a day at the office  is that an orange  im telling you you boys youve got it made  martini lunches  gorgeous women parading through  in my next life im coming back as an ad man  well theres slightly more to it than that  id keep that to yourself  i met his boss yesterday  you should of heard the nice things he said  hes not my boss  well isnt that nice  to be appreciated for what you do  we have some great news  already  honestly you two its not that  we found an apartment  well thats exciting too  yes well unfortunately its  a bit out of our price range right now  ive been looking in the neighborhood   and it seems very well priced to me  whats it going for  we can get it for 30   around here  83rd   but  how many rooms  five two bedrooms two baths a terrace  i dont know  id have to look at it first  thank you  sir  ill take tom or dad you got me  its very generous for you to even consider it  but i think wed rather wait  for what  start your life already  youre gonna be a rich bastard on your own someday  waitings a bunch of bullshit   tom cat  it is  your confidence is really  well its swell  but honestly im not sure its a good idea  i am  pete this is an investment for me and you  and my jellybean over here of course  thank you  youre gonna love it  well be so happy there  i knew theyd help us  i know you did  come on  you cant possibly be angry with me  im just not sure taking that kind of money is a good idea  hes not paying for the whole thing  its still a lot of money  and im not sure what it means  it means we get the apartment  do they get to tell us where to put the furniture  theyre not like that  you would of taken money from your parents   thats different  why  because  thats my money ill get it eventually  so this is my money  sweetheart  he wants to help it makes him feel good  well what about me  well what about me  you always get what you want dont you  i got you  thats all i really wanted  excuse me can we turn on park  i need to meet a client downtown  hush it will only take a sec  the armory  when are they gonna tear that dinosaur down  ill be right back  im in here  glen i said get out  young man what is wrong with you  this room is occupied  what do you have to say for yourself  look at me  that was very bad  you know better than to walk in on someone like that  that room is private  extremely private  well thats all im trying to say  now look at me  dont you think you owe me an apology  well  im sorry  well good  thats not the way to behave okay  now its all right  im not angry anymore  youre pretty  well thank you dear  really pretty  thats sweet of you to say  how old are you  well im the same age as your mother  how old is your mother  shes 32  im 28  your hair is so beautiful you look like a princess  well i dont know about that  can i have some  what  can i have some of your hair  glen no  just a little piece  you wont even miss it  now off to bed with you  and no radio  good evening gentlemen  walter id like you to meet  my cousins charlotte and wendy  ladies its a pleasure  we were hoping you were petes friends  you must be the man of steel  will you look at that  you could lose a nickel in those dimples  i thought your cousin wendy was a redhead  no thats my cousin doris  she wasnt available this evening  well i think we can make do with this branch of the family  im glad you decided to stay over  so am i  bottle of champagne for the table and another round of these  plus one  you know i had some thoughts  about your campaign today  did you  well i was trying to express  the essentialness of steel  and i thought  bethlehem steel   the backbone of america  what do you think  unbelievable  did draper tell you to try and sneak this one by me  no i was  campbell get off the clock  we have two lovely ladies here  the only backbone im interested in now  is right here  so tell me wendy  what do you do when youre not  lighting up rooms with your smile  im an actress  and i take some classes at hunter  do you  i would of thought you slept all day and bathed in milk  how was it  it was nice very quiet  in case youre interested  thank you  ill be sure to look at it  i cant thank you enough  i hope that i can return the favor sometime  please dont even think about it  looks pretty familiar  well i wanted to maintain our original strategy  but i think the word play achieves what youre looking for  the idea that from the acorn that is bethlehem steel  comes americas great cities  i know this isnt the idea you want to sell me  so dont sell it so damn well  excuse me  the backbone idea  campbell pitched it to me last night  i like it  what backbone idea  bethlehem steel the backbone of america  wasnt that it  right  its concise strong and frankly  i like that you were so enthusiastic about it  you couldnt wait to tell me  thanks again boys  pleasure to make you happy walt  hope your visit to new york was productive  im warming to the place  nice work  i told you i had ideas  yes you did  good one  enjoy it  you know what i think  i think i did something good and you got the compliment for it  listen pete  i need you to go get a cardboard box  put your things in it  okay  you picked the wrong time to buy an apartment  everybody out  now  remember pete campbells last day  its today  what happened  while i was breaking my neck trying to fix the hash he made yesterday  he was out at the st regis pitching copy  his copy  that little shit  it was hard to see her  all alone like that  supporting herself with that sad little job at the jewelry store  frozen food  i mean i know she gets some kind of help but  still she looks so exhausted  she tries to put on a brave face  honestly i think shes jealous of me  ive seen it before i was in a sority  i mean seeing happy families all around  but i dont know what i can do i mean i cant just disappear i live there  of course my real concern is those children  i mean the baby wont know the difference but that poor little boy  the person taking care of him isnt giving him what he needs  you know  gentlemen please  you really love that thing  you were cute back then  pete campbell  on his way out  sorry to hear that  well cant be avoided im afraid  i wish i could agree with that  hes a junior account executive  who brought his own idea to a client  in a bar  there are rules  there are other rules  whats the problem  new york city is a marvelous machine  filled with a mesh of levers  and gears and springs  like a fine watch wound tight  always ticking  sounds more like a bomb  how much do you know about petes family  nothing except they put out a mediocre product  his mother is dorothy dikeman campbell  the dikemans owned pretty much everything north of 125th street  which i dont know how good your geography is  but thats a fair chunk of the island  so theyre rich so what  well no  his grandfather dropped it all in 29 panicked  some people have no confidence in this country  whats your concern then  well i dont want dorothy dikeman campbell  standing on the dock at fishers island this summer  talking about how badly sterling cooper treated her son  i dont think any of us want that  we lose him  we lose our entree to  buckley deak the maid stone club  the century club dartmouth  gracie mansion sometimes  its a marquee issue for us  see my point  absolutely  hes more valuable to the agency than i am  dont fool yourself  theres a pete campbell at every agency out there  well lets get one of the other ones  youre going to need a stronger stomach  if youre going to be back in the kitchen  seeing how the sausage is made  thought it was a big watch  you handle the words  you know how much we want you here with us  no doubt about that  dons a big boy burt  arent you don  well thank you sir  there you go  im glad were all better now  what you did is totally unacceptable  i realize that  i want you to be very clear about this you were fired  i wanted you out cooper wanted you out  and you would be if it werent for this man  he thought you deserved another chance  thats right  he fought for you  i dont know what to say  say nothing youre here  because of don drapers largess  thank you thank you so much  now i know that your generation went to college  instead of serving so ill illuminate you  this man is your commanding officer  you live and die in his shadow understood   i wont let you down don  jesus campbell  dont ever say that  i bet daily friendship with that bottle  attracts more people to advertising  than any salary you could dream of  thats why i got in  so enjoy it  doing my best here  enough  you dont know how to drink your whole generation  you drink for the wrong reasons  my generation  we drink because its good  because it feels better than unbuttoning your collar  because we deserve it  we drink because its what men do  what about shaky hands  i see a lot of that too with you boys  no joke  your kind with your gloomy thoughts and your worries  youre all busy licking some imaginary wound  not all imaginary  yeah boo hoo  maybe im not as comfortable being powerless as you are  pardon  you know you shouldnt compete with pete campbell   im not  yeah you are  not on a personal level but for the world  i dont know maybe every generation  thinks the next one is the end of it all  i bet there were people in the bible  walking around complaining about kids today  kids today they have no one to look up to  cause theyre looking up to us  of course if youre not going to have livein help  that back room can be used for any number of things  i dont think well be having livein help  just yet do you sweetheart  no i think well be managing on our own for now  im so glad you could come  id like you to meet mrs clifford lyman  shell be one of your new neighbors  and shes on the coop board  of course you know these two  wheres the nursery at  thank you tom  now i dont want to hear that again  mrs lyman trudy campbell so nice to meet you  well arent you darling the two of you  a pleasure  now i know i shouldnt ask but i have to  your mother inlaw was just telling me  that your greatgreat grandfather  was a farmer with isaac roosevelt is that right  yes thats true  that was nicholas dikeman right  on his mothers side  can you imagine orchards on 204th street  hes buried at the church of the intersession  my goodness  wait until i tell my husband  theres going to be a dikeman living in the building hell be so thrilled  sweetheart tell mrs lyman the story  about your greatgreat aunt  getting in that fight with the british soldier and the hessians  you tell it dear  you tell it so much better than i do  well i think it was his greatgreat aunt or  greatgreatgreat im not sure  but it was before the revolutionary war  and the dikemans owned a large tract of land  manhattan by ella fitzgerald
