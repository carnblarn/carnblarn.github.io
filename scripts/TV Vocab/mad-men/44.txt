calls and one lunch  regarding the honda motorcycle company  they control over 50 of the us market  ive seen them theyre cute  theyre miserable at grey  well 50 of the market who wouldnt be  wheres my other half  theyre taking meetings and as of 900 this morning were on the books  three million dollars in potential billings  and theyre venturing into automobiles as well  when can you bring them in  listen let me spare you the agony and the ecstasy  and tell you we are not doing business with them  excuse me  look i dont expect you to understand this because you were a little boy  but i used to be a man with a lot of friends  then world war ii came and they were all killed by your new yellow buddies  look  if bernbach can do business with volkswagen  we can do business with anybody  the war is over roger  why dont we just bring dr lyle evans in here  thatll be enough of that  lucky strike is great meeting adjourned  we dont usually put new business to a vote do we  does anyone really have a problem with this  no when can you bring them in  immediately if possible i dont want to lose our spot  so far ive been advised to read the chrysanthemum and the sword  from what i can tell they have their own way of doing business  bert im hoping youll help us navigate these waters  ill prepare a few salient points keep roger out of the loop  another rather exciting possibility  good work  joan get everybody that book  i at least want them to see it on peoples desks  who the hell is dr lyle evans  i have no idea  the body of a 38yearold unitarian minister  was cremated within hours of his death last night  he had been clubbed by white men who resented his coming to selma  to join negro civil rights demonstrations come in  hi hi  sally  hello  i brought my doctor kit  okay

 not yet  i thought i was clever but it looks like you and i had the same idea  what are you talking about  what do you think honda  you think the rest of these tourists are from j walter thompson  i suppose its possible  well the good news is i think its gonna be between us  the bad news is the best mans gonna win  enjoy your dinner  we will nice to meet you  what are you doing ted my job  whos he some fly i keep swatting away  they havent done half of what we have  the minute he declared himself the competition suddenly we were equal  well as far as im concerned hes no competition at all  hello  were not gonna let this spoil our evening are we  no  do you know how to use those yes  you think you could teach me  what time did they go to bed im really really sorry  they still up no  its just i was watching i v with bobby and i turned around for a second  and sally cut her hair  what  its pretty bad  i couldve just left them alone  she was in the bathroom i didnt know youre supposed to watch them  dont  i finally got her to sleep  do you know the river of shit im gonna get from her mother  im sorry about that i tried to fix it  but youll probably need to take her to the beauty parlor  why the hell did she do that  she probably wanted to look older like hayley mills  i dont know i really shouldnt  consider it severance  look i dont want your advice okay  good night  its probably the kids  hi mom  did you have a nice time yeah  take that hat off  let me explain okay  what the hell happened to you calm down  you cut her hair no  i cut it im sorry  hey betty  it was an accident  jesus betts is that necessary  im really really sorry  damn right youre sorry get up to your room  hold on no now  itll be okay  bobby take your little brother outside and play  you didnt have to hit her  youre right because it doesnt do anything  you have picture day  and forget about your sleepover kids do this  you never did this all i wanted was to have long hair  in fact when my mother was mad at me she would threaten to cut my hair  where the hell were you look it just happened  the sitter wasnt paying attention  you know what i dont want to know about your life  you cant even watch them for a second its like leaving them with nobody  because youre so good with them  take her to the hairdresser  goodbye  betty henry i dont want to hear it  i want him dead  you dont think i feel that  i was divorced betty  my weekends with ellie were sacrosanct  i probably paid for a building in playland and he couldnt take a night off  and who knows who he had watching her some secretary another whore  but  thats him not sally  and little girls do do this and not just ones from broken homes  i know  i was impulsive  ill apologize  having had a girl this age  i can tell you that punishment will only make this worse  so maybe when youre apologizing  you let her know shes going to go to the hairdresser  and she can go on her sleepover  reward her really  really  youre soft you know that  sterling cooper draper pryce may i help you  there you are the honda meetings today and before you bite my head off  im up to date on the protocol with the help of cooper  and we dont have to do anything but avoid criticizing them or giving advice  i ran into ted chaough  how are they in this thing and how could you not know that  this guys drafting off of us  for the record its jwt cgc and us  now if you dont mind i have to get some gifts wrapped  and get these chrysanthemums out of the building  apparently they symbolize death  so much conflicting information  allow me to show you around  our offices are probably more modern than youve seen  but thats the kind of company we are forwardthinking  this is what we call the creative lounge  we cant tell you how it happens but it does happen here  this is too difficult  well tell them something  this is joan harris our chief hostess  id like you to meet ichiro kamura and hachi saito  nice to meet you i hope no ones taken you to benihana  david ogilvy  ive got a very good list of steakhouses just ask  not very subtle are they  no they are not  we are most happily looking forward to presentation  not now i hope  we want more driver for motorcycle  and we shall endeavor to make that happen  and now that we are finished please accept our modest gifts  i cannot accept  a small token  no thank you  please you are our guests  thank you  open it no  later of course  its a cantaloupe  johnnie walker red  thank you very much  thank you  im sorry  i didnt know this meeting was happening  then again i know how some people love surprises  i apologize gentlemen but for some reason i was not informed  in fact someone set a long lunch for me with randolph  well it was last minute and now unfortunately drawn to a close  i have to warn you they wont know its over until you drop the big one  twice  the meeting is not over  we have yet to present the rules  so now youre dictating terms  mr kamura mr saito this is roger sterling  and this is their translator akira takahashi  we give each firm 3000  for a competitive presentation  in this packet are the conditions for the competition  we dont want any conditions we want it to be unconditional  akira go ahead tell them what i said  roger stop it these men are our guests  i know exactly who these men are  you think you can just come in here and well fawn all over you  we beat you and well beat you again  and we dont want any of your jap crap  so sayonara  if you could only know my embarrassment  his wifes very sick hes been drinking a lot  you have our rules  we very much look forward to your presentation  you dont get to kill this account  you know how they are maybe itll kill itself  enough  im not even talking about money right now  im talking about the kind of work you could do for those people  have you seen that motorcycle they love design  as long as my names in that lobby i get to choose whom i do business with  and ive got a lot better reasons than you had with jantzen  jantzen was over  well i made a pledge to a lot of men youll never meet  not to do business with them  christ on a cracker where do you get off  you know what you werent there you werent anywhere  im sorry you cant understand  its been almost 20 years  and whether you like it or not the world has moved on  these are not the same people  how could that be im the same people  you dont think i know what youre doing  youre wrapping yourself in the flag  so you can keep me from bringing in an account  because you know that every chip i make we become less dependent on lucky strike  and therefore less dependent on you  why you little shit roger  get him out of here  the rest of us are trying to build something  hes right  you know what to do  where would you hide a coin youd spend it wouldnt you  i do know where it is ill tell you  then tell me ill make a bargain with you  let these two go keep me ill tell you  promise no  then no deal  what if you wont tell me where that coin is  i refuse to talk in this  what are you doing  nothing  laura  someone else was here  go upstairs  hold still ill get it  whats the problem is she sick i wouldve come and gotten her  no the slumber party ended early  id like to speak to betty  okay honey  is everything all right  no its not  could you leave us alone for a moment  i found sally behaving inappropriately  whatd she do  she was in our den on the couch playing with herself  what  i dont know what goes on here  but that kind of behavior is not allowed in my house  and certainly not in the presence of my daughter  i am  very sorry for this behavior and so is sally  i wouldve done the same thing  well  im sorry about that  i should go  what is wrong with you  you dont do those things  you dont do them in private and you especially dont do them in public  you have nothing to say  i didnt do anything  dont you dare lie to me or ill cut your fingers off  go to bed well deal with this in the morning  what happened  im mortified  im so embarrassed  what happened  she caught sally  playing with herself  whats wrong with her that woman will tell everyone  why is she doing this  i told you if it got serious there is a solution  i dont want to do that henry  its one thing after another  whats wrong with her  maybe its time we let a professional answer that question  henry  i went to a psychiatrist once  what why  because i was unhappy and i dont think it helps anything  i hate to think how much worse it would have been for eleanor without one  they train them just for kids we got ours from the school  im saying this not because im so sure theres something wrong with her  but i think this is very hard on you two  when did you go years ago  i was bored  can we leave it at that of course  miss blankenship any luck on that call to california  im sorry no answer  misters peters and pryce to see you  send them in  i think were okay but everything they do is inside out  i got a call this morning from my contact there masao  telling me that the meeting was a margaret dumontsized disaster  but then lane  then nearly 20 minutes later masao called me and set a time for our presentation  look theres probably a guy like roger at every firm  theyve outgrown it and we havent  roger has something to say  mn cooper and mn sterling  i realize that i should not at this point limit our potential clients in any way  next account no matter what it is youll have my full support  and  look i know its an old one and i have to let it go just for my health alone  and well hell its over  your contrition wouldnt have gotten you out of this but youre lucky  they called us today and gave us an appointment anyway  that means nothing  its over no bert i said we have a meeting  its most likely that they are expecting us to come in and resign  how do you get there from here  have we received a gift  we should have gotten one yesterday i havent  miss blankenship have i received any packages today  yes  could you bring it in please  it says don on it  give it to him  help me honda help help me honda love teddy chaough  so there is no gift thats how they work  they want us to go in there bow down and beg them to chop our heads off  because we disgraced ourselves how could you admire these animals  would you shut up theyre businessmen and you insulted them to their face  im expecting a child  jai alai clearasil now honda  chaough wins another one by default  hes not going to win  im not wasting that appointment  we need to do something that will make them notice us fireworks  do you have a campaign no  but i will and were gonna shoot a whole commercial for it  something outrageous something graphic  the rules limit us to boards and copy  it specifically says no finished work  because no ones ever won an account by breaking the rules  not with the japanese  youre trying to tell me if we put our backs into this thing  we couldnt turn their heads  three thousand dollars is all we have  that should buy about four seconds of your commercial  you dont think its worth going out of pocket  what pocket  a spec commercial will eat up our ability to pitch any more new business this year  and its only march  i would be willing to risk bankrupting this place  if i didnt think we were already dead in the water  but we are  come on bert  hello  am i catching you alone  what do you want  i prefer not to talk about this on the phone  but its our feeling that sally needs to see a psychiatrist  our feeling  why because she cut her hair  no its more serious this time  and im telling you because i found someone through the school  a children specialist  what exactly did she do she set the house on fire  she was masturbating don in front of a friend  does that seem normal to you  really  boy or girl  jesus whats the difference  the doctor needs to speak with us individually of course  so youve made up your mind why are you even calling me  shes out of control i thought youd be concerned  i am i just dont know that she needs a doctor  cant you talk to her  you think i want this i dont know what else to do  you know what kind of little girls do that  fast ones  shes 10 years old  well dont think she doesnt understand  she understands a lot of things thanks to you  what  i dont care what you do but just dont do it with her there  you brought another man into your bed into her house  you dont think she noticed that  one man don how many have you had in your bachelor pad  that girl you had watching her whos she im married  jesus you ever hear yourself  ill give the information to your secretary  perfect good night  yes  have you seen these im trying to figure out what makes it work  im still wondering what makes you work  joan pete peggy  dont touch it i want to see how long it goes  whats wrong  a man is shamed by being openly ridiculed and rejected  it requires an audience  what is that fortune cookie  its from that book you were all supposed to read  apparently making a commercial for the honda pitch would bankrupt us  and its against the rules  forget the rules for a second  cgc is the same size as us  so if we cant afford to do anything they cant afford to  so everybodys bankrupt  chaough said hes in my rearview mirror  well guess what  im gonna make a left turn right off a cliff  all i have to do is let chaough think im making a commercial and hell make one  so whats our campaign  we dont have a campaign were not doing anything  he just needs to think we are  so what hes going to make a commercial  what if its fantastic hell win the account  you let me worry about that  i know shes the best rep there is but she told me you were unavailable  i am clearasil doesnt wrap until friday night but maybe you could push it  it sounds interesting  well howard im going to insist on your discretion at this point  of course  its going to be four to five days  just a minute could you get the door  im sorry i thought id put this in here  later  sorry about that thats okay  you didnt see that no of course not  thats draper isnt it  yes  anyway its 12 scenes one of them obviously has a crowd  youll need to figure out how to shoot on the staten island ferry  to it and from it and how youre going to close fifth avenue  ill be honest id give anything to do this but right now im too busy  anyway you know id much rather shoot your honda commercial  i dont have one  why the hell did they call you in they know ive got you booked  how can they afford that  get that kid in here who worked for draper  anticipation  suspense  a honda tears through a subway tunnel the train nipping at its tire  he keeps looking back the train roaring at him  hes wearing a racing helmet and then you see him head up the steps  can they do that howardll make them do that  and then he gets out on the sidewalk stops  kicks down the kickstand takes off the helmet  and he is a she california blonde  hands down thats your best idea  well bring a guy to the pitch in a racing helmet  have him take it off its a sexy girl  what  we only have 3000 were not shooting shit  how long did you work for draper  a little over two years  when you were in a bakeoff he ever break the rules  i dont know he wouldnt have shared it with me  but he definitely doesnt think the rules apply to him  he once disappeared for a month  does he like to play games  hes always thinking on the edges of where you are  i dont know hes a genius  you ever talk that way about me  you know what why dont you go work for your boyfriend get out  and give me 20 different words for pimples out  call barbara about howard here and contact the city of new york  we need a subway  how are you doing  excuse me can i help you  were late no youre not  closed set sorry  you scared me  who are you feeding today  world travelers samsonite  this is like a coconut  be careful  there was a trapeze artist  he made more in an hour here than he makes in a week at the circus  have you ever had this sake no  i dont know how people drink the way you do around here  id fall asleep  so whats it like being a trapeze artist  or did you just ask him about his luggage  its good  he was surprisingly modest  his father does it better than him  he actually said that  best part of my job  youd be surprised what people will say to an interested stranger  why does everybody need to talk about everything  i dont know but they do  and no matter what happens while theyre talking when theyre done they feel better  you have kids  no  what does your husband do  im not married  but youre wearing a are you divorced  no  this is just a stop sign  i walk into a lot of offices and its helped me avoid a lot of distracting conversations  but you told me  do you have children  i do  two boys and a girl oneandahalf seven and 10  im sure it must be hard to be apart  i dont see them enough  and when i do i dont know what to do  and when i drop them off i feel relieved  and then i miss them  im sorry  it is not going well  my exwife thinks my daughter needs a psychiatrist  and i assume youre against that  i dont know  well i cant say theres any evidence to support this  but im pretty sure that if you love her and she knows it shell be fine  well thank you for the drink  i should be going  fake dinner plans with your fake husband  good night  now from what you told me on the phone  this year has been quite eventful for your family  i know it seems fast but i felt children had no concept of time  and henrys really taken to them  he has a daughter and shes such an exceptional young woman  if you choose to have sally work with me id like to meet her  and then interview you and your exhusband  i doubt youll ever meet him thats his level of interest  is this most recent incident of the most concern for you  well i know the divorce is mostly to blame  but shes been different ever since my father died  he lived with us briefly  they were very close  i wish he had met henry thats my husband  they wouldve gotten along  my mother i dont know  my goodness if i had done what sally did my mother was very strict about it  my brother he saved his money and bought a nudist magazine and showed it to me  and then my mother found it and she nailed it to his bedroom door  what about you  i was private and mostly outgrew it  i see  dr keener call me dr edna thats what the kids do  of course i know children do this but not in public  i feel like sally did this to punish me somehow for everything  that must be a terrible feeling  it is  you have to believe me i had to get divorced  i felt it best for them to have some stability in their life  and in the end she doesnt understand that itll be better  sounds to me like it wouldnt be bad for you to talk to someone  no no im okay  well i think itd be helpful if you and i were to meet once a month  just to keep up with sallys progress  will you tell me what she talks about in here  no  and the other way around as well  thats better  so i think we should start at four days a week  let me go get my date book  wheres your film what film  thats how youre shaking it i heard it stunk  we didnt make one its too expensive  well then youre out of luck donny  cause i sure wouldnt want to follow what i showed them  with a speech and a couple of posters  sterling cooper draper pryce  donald draper  where is mr cooper and mr campbell  and sterling  they couldnt make it  you created this set of rules to even the playing field  it says specifically no finished work  i understand not everybody has observed this  i dont really want to be a part of a competition like that  so im withdrawing us  thank you for thinking of us  good afternoon  the voiceover announcer for lucky has a severe case of chest congestion  get the boy wonder on it  greg accounts  no pete  have a drink itll make me look younger  im not gonna watch you feel sorry for yourself  i feel sorry for all of us  dons over there surrendering right now  would you stop  there was a kid on the destroyer pfc brycen  and he was an honesttogoodness poet  and then during roger i dont want to hear it  my husbands gonna be in uniform any day now  but how do you think hes gonna feel  when one day some pete campbell goes to some vietnamese doctor  since when is forgiveness a better quality than loyalty  roger i know it was awful  and i know itll never seem like it was that long ago  but you fought to make the world a safer place and you won and now it is  you think so  really  i have to  anything else no  good afternoon your daughters psychiatrist called  lower your voice please  congratulations  i just spoke with mr saito  it seems honda was never going to leave grey  but of the three princes invited to meet the princess  you were the most charming  were first in the door on their little car  and cgc  out of the running  we killed him  that stunt you pulled was unseemly  the only reason i let you continue was  let me  do you think joan can rent stage space without talking to me  i let you because i realized that our financial future  was related to mr chaoughs demise  so what is it  are you thanking me or reprimanding me  lets not pretend like this wasnt a big risk were thanking you  send over what you have on the car  it redlines at 9500 rpm but it only has 57 horsepower  what  its a motorcycle with doors  the nice thing is it has windows  so you can see your brains spatter against it when it crashes  theyre working on it  cheers  hello sally  im dr edna  why dont you come inside
