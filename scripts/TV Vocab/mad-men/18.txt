                mad men 2x5 the new girl  mr and mrs campbell  im dr stone  and how are we today  were so pleased to be here my friend sara driscoll  her father is head of obstetrics at lenox hill   she said you get results  they got results  sometimes all a young couple needs is a good oldfashioned handholding  have a seat mr campbell  now  i am going to ask you some questions together  and more intimate ones separately  how long have you been trying to conceive   that sounds like a long time is it  lets not worry about whats normal everyone is different  are you two aware of the principles of conception  of how the sperm meets the egg  yes  although if youd like to show us some films  youd be surprised  prior to the decision to conceive were you using birth control   she was  i used a diaphragm  although its possible i didnt need to  mrs campbell  so were walking in the park after lunch  and he sees these birds  picking seeds out of some horse shit  and he says move over fellows thats my job  that sounds like a visit from the stork or de beers  or it could be just a new hairdo  mr rumsen mr draper  how are you this morning   joan  good morning  well theres your answer   ever had mumps  yes   how old were you  summer of45   did your testicles descend normally  absolutely  and have you ever fathered a child  no  have you ever had difficulty completing the sexual act  drinking doesnt help  but no i always reach home base  do you have difficulties with arousal  jesus  im a redblooded american male okay  no one is questioning your manhood mr campbell  you could be a warrior  an athlete a bull of a man  george washington was sterile  fertility has nothing to do with manliness  do you want to have a child  what kind of question is that  course i do  what man doesnt want a child  although you think about the world right now  the bomb   do you worry about the world  occasionally  do you work with xrays radioactive material  or toxic chemicals  im in advertising  we got a xerox machine but i dont use it  not personally  advertising huh must be a lot of fun  are you kidding  im an account man  i spend half my day tiptoeing around creative crybabies  and the other half drinking with ungrateful turnips  who just fell off the truck  im completely replaceable  even though i just brought in a huge account  then  you throw this baby thing on top of it  the economy contracting my inlaws  yes yes its a lot   what about your parents  my father just passed away  oh im sorry to hear that  do you think that has something to do with this  it doesnt  i mean  i try not to think about it  its been a few months  it is a difficult moment in the life cycle  but we are part of a continuum arent we  so maybe im the end of the line  thatll do it mr campbell   i think i feel better already  can you send in your wife  and then id like you to schedule a time with a nurse  for a semen analysis  whenever shes free  red and green are my colors so were gonna do christmas  he doesnt know that yet  i can cover mr drapers desk for you   i know youll have your hands full  you had your shot  its beautiful  miss holloway those arent wedding bells  im so sorry mr draper  mr drapers office  one moment please  mr draper bobbi barrett on line 1  thank you  bobbi  don i want you to ask me how i am  how are you  where are you right now  im in my office  where you called me   you sound a little tipsy  we did it  we sold grin and barrett  congratulations you got an order  no but were going to make a pilot  i remember that because jimmy said  ask her shes made every pilot in town  come celebrate with me  im at sardis surrounded by clowns  and why would i come  im being ignored come take up my time  im working  you provided key advice  we can call it business  no lets not confuse this  im about to change my mind  thank you  was there even a party  hell have an old fashioned  buddy hackett told jimmy  that gleason didnt have to make a pilot  so jimmy went home to sulk  and the rest went out to celebrate that they ruined his day  so here we are  i expect him to get this way when its bad  but when its good  maybe he doesnt understand how big this is  no he does  its the big opportunity hes bound to ruin   mr draper  miss menken  actually its mrs katz   this is my husband tilden  pleasure  mr drapers firm did some work for us a while back  advertising   im bobbi barrett  im sorry  mrs barretts husband is a comedian who works with me   nice to meet you  tilden i love comedians  so how are things at grey  are they still taking credit for

wrong about that  in the end were in different businesses okay  to a nice price on the pilot  and i boxed them in for 39 on the air if they order  you should have seen my neckline  you really do his business dont you  if it wasnt for me it wouldnt be grin and barrett  itd be grin and brownstein  this is america  pick a job and then become the person that does it  well thats true  right after i met jimmy  i watched  somebodys uncle morty close a deal for him  and i realized i negotiate for everything  the rent the plumber my hairdresser  i even did it in a department store once  its touchy because youre really telling somebody  theyre not worth what they think but you cant hurt their feelings  negotiating is a bore  its handtohand combat  you dont like negotiating what the hell do you
