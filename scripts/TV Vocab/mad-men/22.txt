samsonite  and freddie rumsen pissed his pants  what  hes not talking about nerves here hes talking about a wet pair of pants  really  howd the presentation go  don its conduct unbefitting  of freddie rumsen  were lucky campbell here grabbed the controls  he locked rumsen up and threw peggy olsen in  were lucky the bench is deep  we have to cut him loose   is that necessary  the man is a train wreck  we at least need to get him off this account  they called already theyre thrilled with peggy  no i dont want him on any of my accounts   this could have happened in a meeting  but it didnt  thatll be all boys  thank you for bringing this to our attention  were not doing him any favors keeping him around  ducks a teetotaler hes been gunning for freddie since day 1  hes got a point  we cant even tall cooper about this  you know his whole thing with germs  i dont think its in my contract  that duck can fire someone in my department  you dont have a contract  and i can fire anyone i want to  we really dont have a choice  you can still get him to give blood  the agencies will laugh about this but the clients  they already think were all like that  well say its a sixmonth leave of absence  so he can go for the cure  hell know what that means  you dont want to throw him away  your loyalty is starting to become a liability  lets do this before he finds out we dont need any more accidents  dinner tonight  you need to call the missus  ill make it  m case  how are you  its a beautiful day  have you just ridden or are you about to ride  i can never tell whether youre before or

it  whats the big deal  you remember bob peebles how mean he was  he fired his secretary and he threw all her things out the window  including her keys  that was good for morale  what is this about  duck phillips  hes as dry as a bone he doesnt understand this business  freddie my father would have fired you for this  your father drank more than the two of you put together  he used to come in with his shirt on insideout  he admired you  i however had different feelings at the time  when we first met  bonny prince sterling here thought i was a coward  because i was in the signal corps  i didnt know it was only for his last six months  i thought he was a typist  turns out before that he was in charge of killing people  and by people i mean germans  it was a long time ago  come on be proud what was it like 15 of them  thats impressive  look i can be completely in control  my podiatrist went to hazleton  came back a new man with great stories only drinks beer now  its the best thing freddie  well i guess you get dealt the hand you get dealt right  i can pull myself together i got a great book  maybe ill head to philly or boston  theyre all dying to do what we do here  you know ill recommend you  fantastic so this could be good  there are a lot of great towns  my father sold greeting cards  he used to come into the kitchen unroll this map on the table  and put a finger
