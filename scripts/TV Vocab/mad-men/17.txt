                wikitlecom  but when the flesh lusts against the spirit  and the spirit against the flesh  the rational soul is supported by the cross of christ  nor does it when seded by evil desires  consent to evil doings for it is pierced by the nails of continence  and the fear of god and as at all times we must live worthily  so at all times we must bear the cross which for each one is rightly called his  for it is born by each one   im not feeling so good  thats because youre hung over   i can smell it  we have supper  shes been fasting all day i need your help  and as a rule there

hidden camera situations  only jimmys the host and hes jimmy you know not nice  its derivative with a twist thats what theyre looking for  its called grin and barrett   thats cute  i thought it up all by myself  abcs sick about losingcandid camera  but youd have to get jimmy out of his contract with utz  i thought about that its exclusive but they could come on as sponsors  show needs a national sponsor utz wont do you any good  youre a pessimist they could let him out  they should want to keep jimmy happy  they dont care  but they could be told that their spots would have more punch  wherever they air if jimmys on a hit television show  that is very good advice  will you sell the show for me  im not interested in doing that  but i can talk to the schillings  whats this  i was thinking how i could avoid getting bored with you  bobbi i have work  bullshit  its good  but we should sell them on the mascot first the jingles going to be a cutie  hasselbachs at 3 right is he

 roger will handle the introductions mr cooper mr sterling  creative to the right accounts to the left starting with myself  then the american airlines people then campbell  pete youre next to our man shel keneally  there will be one for each of them  we cant get cordovan by friday so were going with maroon  campbell will run the show he has a list of every ad we need in the presentation  art department needs to make sure that every image  we use in a comp is an airplane that american has  no cutting and pasting planes from other ads  they may all look alike to us but  why are you here  im uh head of the televion department  we have 90 minutes to present ill do the setup  the history of american airlines up to and including the crash  ill tee up creative with what research says travelers are  waiting to hear from american and then don you do what you do  maybe you could give us a little peek  im not ready to do that yet  i say we show all three campaigns eliminate all possible objections  something for everybody  remember this isnt the work we have to run in the end  this is about winning these guys over  creative in my office  you have big ones  my mommy has big ones too  and im going to have big ones when i grow up  i dont care if were just selling a point of view but we  have to commit to one thing they dont like wiggle room  they like to see us blowing up bridges behind us  these are the boards for the  music you can talk over  stewardesses were going to bookend every spot with the plane taking  off and landing up down no problems everything okay every commercial  wheres that list ducks buddy shel gave us  with all the things that make american different  whats that  the ad you asked for to recruit stewardesses  it equates what should be a glamorous job with being a waitress in a tin can  wheres the bar of soap the ticket sleeves whos doing the inflight menu  i think its the best menu ive ever written  this is in french how do i know its right  its right  make up a chef  peggy did you pick out a china pattern yet  did you find the one from the queen mary  yes but there needs to be a decision if were doing anything to the logo  i dont know  we got a lot of bricks but i dont know what the building looks like  so how are you vicki  im in a very good mood  well i hate to sound remedial but i havent done this since i was in the navy   been with a girl  no not that  oh dont worry the prices may have changed but the menus still the same  well your invoice ran across my desk  look at you  the menu hasnt changed  is it open for negotiation  i dont want to ruin the magic  how about double plus carfare  and ill assume you live far away  thatll be 100  but i want everything i want  isnt that the perfect thing to say  thats not so bad is it  i have to warn you im not in great health  dont believe what they say  no one dies doing this  are you resting everybodys resting   no im thinking  lets have a conversation  is that your maid   no shes my girlfriend  do you kiss her   sometimes  do you lay on top of her  you know what sally your daddys going to be angry if i dont do my work  oh okay  just a minute girls its almost your turn  you know well get to go anywhere american flies  familiarization  well have to rent another floor well all have our own offices  do you realize we will get to pick out the stewardesses  okay  son of a bitch   you there  chewing your cud  its one thing to be unladylike its another to treat our  office like a subway platform pack up your wrigleys and go home  how could it be my gum my gums in my mouth    thank you for getting him out of here for the day  lose the gum then get yourself some dinner he wont rember firing you  american airlines is not about the past any more than america is  ask not about cuba ask not about the bomb  were going to the moon throw everything out  everything  there is no such thing as american history only a frontier  that crash happened to somebody else  its not about apologies for what happened its about those sen men  in the room on friday and what airline they are going to be running  so what does that mean  lets pretend we know what 1963 looks like  jesus draper make a decision  whats that leave us with introductions  if i cant mention the crash theres no preamble at all  let it go our job is to bend down the branch let him pick the fruit  that champagne is probably near frozen  im meeting a friend  you know what i really want   is there something we left out  have dinner with me  i told you im meeting a friend  ill pay for his meeting too  you wouldnt think dinner would be pushing it on the extras  have you been to lutce yet  i have i think youd like it  ive got it  its great but theyre cheeky  they started with this prix fixe menu at lunch 850 for lunch  and they have these wines what kind of wine do you like  i dont know red  theyre going to make you be more specific than that  we can walk if you dont mind a little rain  you know

gerry warming up the car  shel keneally was fired this morning  what  the rest are on their way in   whats going on  its over  so why are they coming in  because they have to  and we have to deliver a stillborn baby  mr phillips the gentlemen are here from american airlines  send them in  in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti amen  in the name of the father son and the holy spirit amen

them  i took the lords name in vain three times and  and i am so angry father  i am so angry at my little sister  shes causing my mother so much pain  she had a child out of wedlock  she seduced a married man its a terrible sin  and she acts like it didnt even happen  and i hate her for it  and i feel so guilty about it  but everyone keeps falling all over themselves trying to help her  and she goes on like nothing happened  nothing at all  what about me father  my troubles  what about me being good for what  i understand its difficult you know its not your place to judge  god sees your goodness   it doesnt feel that way father  try to trust god on this  you will get your reward in heaven  god loves you and he knows that you love your sister  i do  say three hail marys and two our fathers  and try to forgive your sister shes not as strong as you are  would you like to make your act of contrition  o my god i am heartily sorry for having offended thee  i detest all my sins

thing  its heaking  but still good work don  come on  we hired him to bring in new business not lose old business  dont you love the chase  sometimes it doesnt work out those are the stakes  but when
