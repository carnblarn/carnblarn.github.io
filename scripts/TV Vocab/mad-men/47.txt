of bottlers the work  and they dont like witches brewing things  they dont like the occult in general  and you told them its their hillbilly working a still  i did but the fact remains that in the world of sodie pop  pepsi is the tail and the bottlers are the dog  they just want us to change the drawing  except its damaged goods  theyre never gonna want to see that board again start over  i did it with joey do you want stan to take over  youre spreading me awful thin  do you want me to tell joan to figure it out  it you dont even know what it is  miss blankenship get joan in here  she startles when you do that  i had an uncle who was blind shes not blind  shes recovering from cataract surgery  he had syphilis  he would come in the room and he would say  what can i do for you  a redo on mountain dew  i want to make joey full time for a couple of weeks  id have to doublecheck on his availability  but are you sure hes the right fit  he did the first round  and were redoing it  its more complicated than that  well this may not be the time or the place to bring this up but  what now ive been hearing complaints about him  really  hes not a gentleman with the girls  okay one juicy story  ill protect those concerned but it involves an extremely blue joke  when it doesnt matter  fine you can tell it to me later boys will be boys  of course but im going to call in other books  theres too much to do  i know the joke  this guys balls are so big are we done  sure  can you tell ray charles to come in here and clean this up  and as soon as you get to hollywood you find out that that myth is  well it has some truth to it there is instant fame  whats this have to do with peyton place  well we went down to the set  and ryan was doing this scene against another rival  i cant tell you who and the guy was awful  and i start to hear him talk about a young fresh face  wholesome but a little mischievous  am i crazy  i dont understand you want to be an actor  does that sound like me thats you you could do it  i know the right people  maybe not the big screen but the small screen definitely  im kind of down to earth  youre so handsome i showed them a picture  howd

thinking of me  youre too modest you know that  what were you doing in there  every place ive worked theres always some old fairy who comes on to me  but that was the weirdest by far  yes everybody wants you joey  it happens a lot what did you do to joan  i told her off  well you shouldnt have shes important around here  let me tell you something about the big rag  were creative and shes an overblown secretary  fine dont listen to me  theres a joan in every company  my mother was a joan  always telling everybody what to do  she even wore a pen around her neck so people would stare at her tits  shes not your mother and she and lane basically run this place  okay message received  is it time to go yet  glad you could make it  well we were on our way to the theater anyway  ralph stuben this is my wife betty  pleased to meet you i hope you dont mind  the congressman wanted me to do this immediately  and he didnt want me to do it over the phone  she doesnt mind and shes very discreet  thats the curse of a political wife  that and having to eat dinner with a lot of people you dont know  bettys no stranger to public service  so what show did you see  why dont we get a drink at the bar  itll only be a minute  thank you  so are you a felix or an oscar  like most men id rather be an oscar but im probably a felix  every date feels like a first date with you  is that good or bad  its just i know you must be seeing someone else  and dont say no because itll just hurt me more  look im here with you right now  were on a date  and i thought we were getting to know each other  it doesnt just accumulate it takes intense prolonged contact  dont you want to be close with anyone  i do  i know were from different generations  but im going to need more from you  we are from different generations  because i dont remember women pushing this hard  and im not seeing anyone  im working  all the time  well i get excited when you call and then i dont hear from you  we dont have to get married for me to show you off at the country club  don  how are you  im fine henry  henry betty this is miss van nuys  bethany  enjoy your dinner  my goodness what was that  well that was actually my exwife and her husband  and some slob whos about to have the worst dinner of his life  what her  well first of all my official capacity if anyone asks  im here to thank you for securing the governors endorsement  for congressman lindsay  thats no small feat im sure  well rocky only hates him because hes handsome  well not to worry  lindsay just wants to be mayor  any talk of the white house is fiction  i guess he hasnt seen the cover of life  okay  hypothetically  the congressman is putting together a team with his eye on 72  and well it would be built  if it were going to be built around you  and yes he doesnt want rocky to have you either  elizabeth do you know what you want  honey this part is almost over  im sorry youll have to excuse me  one drink and she gets flushed  yeah my wife has the other problem  are you okay in there maam yes im fine  you dropped your purse ill take it  what did you want me to do put you in a cab  that wouldnt be right  i cant believe you

seeing her i dont hate her  youre a saint im an adult  it was upsetting cant you let me have that  not when it ruins the whole evening  this man is asking me to take lindsay all the way  that could happen don draper doesnt have a say  youre right who cares about him you do  hes taking up too much space in your life  maybe in your heart  thats ridiculous  look  maybe we rushed into this  we  i was six months pregnant when we met  pull over are you kidding me  let me out henry  no you know what let me out at the house  because you dont want to live there anyway  you can stay in a hotel or wherever you were when i met you  in your mansion with your servants  shut up betty youre drunk  what are you doing  making you comfortable  shes a sweet girl  and she wants me to know hen  but i already do  people tell you who they are but we ignore it  because we want them to be who we want them to be  to be continued  i bet she was thinking of that line all night  i looked up at the barbizon and i thought of all the women in there  one in every room  touching themselves to sleep  waverly and 6th  i like sleeping alone  stretching out like a skydiver  cool patches to roll onto  i should appreciate it more  no no im talking now  i dont care where you go and i dont care what you do  so in order  would you let me talk i want my key back  and i dont want to see your shorts on my floor  and i dont want you complaining that i dont cook cause i dont cook  you know what david go shit in the ocean  good morning  are you leaving already  were you going to say goodbye  i thought you

three ingredients for a cocktail  vodka and mountain dew is an emergency  don wants our freelance art director joey baird  put on full time for the next three weeks  none of my business i suppose  i really think this vending machine is a troublemaker  i think its been a great success  revenue is climbing  i was gonna suggest we get a sandwich machine  wed probably get 40 of the work force keeping busy through lunch  or wed end up with a bunch of fat secretaries  who think the whole afternoon is lunchtime  because theres always another sandwich around the corner  there have been a lot of complaints  did you tell them to call the number  what do you think theyre doing in there lane and joan  its an unholy alliance  i know exactly what theyre doing in there  joans on the desk boobs on the blotter  lanes behind her  probably has a bowler hat am i wrong  hey dont do that  im not doing anything joans doing it  mountain dewdah  give me three cocktails with at least three ingredients

boring  i think im hungry do you want to eat  you mean order in  i dont know you seem kind of dressed up  we could take fillmore parts with us if you want  just to clarify  youd like to have dinner with me  yes  you asked me out the first time i came in here  why would it be different for me now  it just felt like the timing is right  so why dont we do that  you could ask me out for dinner at some future date  instead of i dont know  tacking it on to a workday like an afterthought  i could do that  saturday night far enough in the future  not normally but youre in luck  good  okay then  ive got enough to go on here  okay  good night good night  its francine come in  im all bitten up  this is my potato salad bowl but this ones yours  well thank you  henry was going to pick one up on his way home from work  but hes been so busy  betty hes very ambitious  hes mad at me  why would that be so  oh god if i can make it through this weekend  its a twoyearolds birthday party  and youll have help and no one cares  is he coming  i told him about it  now i can only hope he wont show up and ruin it  well he wont  we ran into him in the city  on a date  bethany van nuys she was all of 15  i misbehaved  henry didnt understand it for some reason  why do you let him bother you  we see him walking out with the kids some weekends  carlton calls him that sad bastard  thats an act  hes living the life let me tell you  he doesnt get to have this family and that  betty  you have terrible luck with entertaining  just be careful  don has nothing to lose and you have everything  i dont know if you heard but i tired joey  i did good for you  excuse me  now everybody in the office will know that you solved my problem  and that you must be really important i guess  whats wrong with you  i defended you  you defended yourself  fine  that cartoon was disgusting  i had already handled it  and if i had wanted to go further  one dinner with mr kreutzer from sugarberry ham  and joey wouldve been off it and out of my hair  so its the same result  you want to be a big shot  well no matter how powerful we get around here  they can still just draw a cartoon  so all youve done is prove to them that im a meaningless secretary  and youre another humorless bitch  have a nice weekend good night peggy  when a man walks into a room  he brings his whole life with him  he has a million reasons for being anywhere  just ask him  if you listen hell tell you how he got there  how he forgot where he was going  and then he woke up  if you listen hell tell you about the time he thought he was an angel  or dreamt of being perfect  and then hell smile with wisdom  content that hed realized the world isnt perfect  were hawed because we want so much more  we re ruined  because we get these things  and wish for what we had  you smell nice  so do you  like chlorine  ive been swimming  does it feel like summer  it clears my head  for the creative process for something  ive been a little out of sorts lately  and its an effort to get in the water  but when you do youre weightless and you dont even sweat  and in the end  youre wrung out  ive been looking forward to this  its very hard to get a reservation here  you shouldve called me  i know a guy  really  whos your guy  my father  a lot of people who supply restaurants  know a lot of the same people who know my father  like  not my father just his friends  he owns a candy store  and there are certain responsibilities that go along with that  interesting  whats he like  hes a handsome twobit gangster like you  two glasses of chianti  when im out of sorts i look at the calendar  theres usually something significant on the horizon  i never noticed that  its my twoyearolds birthday  but im not going  why not  because im not welcome there  he thinks that mans his father  maybe thats okay  all he knows of the world is what you show him  thats nice  i know ive sometimes behaved to the contrary  but i do admire your work  thats nice to hear  so tell me a trade secret  how do you get them to do what you want them to do  aesop has a fable about the wind and the sun  the wind and sun had this competition  to see if they could get a travelers coat off  so the wind blows fiercely on him  but the traveler just pulls his coat tighter  but the sun shines down on him warmer and warmer  and the traveler just takes it off  and the moral is  kindness gentleness and persuasion win where force fails  you know aesop did that in probably 10 lines  hes very economical  so what youre saying is you want my coat   thank you  where do you live  only around the corner  really  yes  but im just going to take you to your door  and why is that  because thats as far as i can go right now  and im not ready to say good night  thats not what i expected  hello francine hello don  daddy  whats he doing here  its okay  here you go say hi to daddy  happy birthday  we have everything
