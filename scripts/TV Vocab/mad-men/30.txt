                i dont care if its windy or rainy theres no reason for a shake roof to fail  if its laid right  except that one  no flashing around the chimney thats gonna cost em  go around  now im gonna push it up  to 25mph thats what were allowed to do here  youve gotta really pay attention  nothing about the holy father  hes still dead ma  the shower cap pulled up  yes  piece of junk  if you want ill have gerry come over and fix your shower  it was fixed but i think ronnie the super sneaks in and breaks it  for all i know hes going through my things right now  you dont like getting a little bit of attention  anita this man does not look the way you want him to  id offer you a room but since mom moved in i dont have it  i want to move to manhattan  really  its so far away  it is far  and i commute almost two hours total every day  five days a week  thats an extra week of work each month  my goodness i never thought of that  pegs the rents there theyre outrageous  i know but im already spending a fortune between subway fare  cab fare on late nights pantyhose  if i cant find a newspaper the cane on the seats destroys them  and itll be easy with that savings and a roommate  jeez louise youve been really thinking about this  ma thats not good for it  why dont you move in here and we send her to manhattan  are you going to be one of those girls  i am one of those girls  well hoho ive observed your wishes for secrecy  but now is the time  gentlemen  imagine the perfect mixture  of athletics spectacle and speed  jai alai  jai alai is like handball  only you fling the ball and catch the ball  with this basket thing  its more complicated than that and dangerous  ill leave the looseleaf  but it shows the way jai alai attendance is growing  in seven years itll eclipse baseball  go ahead you can laugh  but its got the same fingerprint as baseball only better  a special stadium called a fronton  and you can sit real close which is a thrill  because the ball goes 175mph  and its got patxi  hes babe ruth only handsome  this is patxi  i was looking for boxers but i bought his contract instead  hes the greatest player in the world  mel ferrer  im terrified of him catching balls in the face  so lets say  theres enough money  how would you chop it up  well most of its going to end up in television  perfect because i want a tv show   a sports show  did you see patxi  you dont see him flying around the world  solving crimes and banging broads  harry has excellent relationships with the networks  well itll probably have to be abc  no no  i want to be on all the networks  like when the president addresses the nation  tuesday night 830900  all three networks the same show  no ones ever done it  because  thats true  how about a starstudded  big musical special with a jai alai match   desi arnaz  what else you got   well theres print  womens magazines  a glamorous night in miami   with a free admission  tuesday night is ladies night  and of course newspapers are key but you cant limit yourself to less than 10 markets  this is impressive   dont get up  horace this is don draper  i told you hed be stopping by  dont let me interrupt  so far for the jai alai campaign  sterling cooper will produce an adventure program  starring your handsome fella   a musical spectacular  on all three networks and it has to be in color  cbs doesnt have color  fine id like to get the ladies magazines in color  and maybe a color page in the sunday paper  what about radio  youll have to take radio the way it is  i dont think its worth anyones time  unless youre willing to commit to at least  1 million to start  sure but thats a third of my ad budget  well as they used to say at the freshmen mixer  when you get a yes you go home  only humps you never got one  listen draper id love to buy you dinner   run some slogans by you  actually hoho  we buy you dinner  that was fun  im going to have to buy campbell a case of something  patxi  during the depression i saw somebody throw  a loaf of bread off the back of a truck  it was more dignified  are you going to have trouble sleeping tonight  ive seen clients far more defenseless than he  well as the bible says  enjoy your fatted calf  campbell did you tell him who this idiots father is  he said hes a shipping magnate not a client  horace senior is connected to bert cooper in a million ways  and i dont know if he would like what just happened in there  you want to run it by his daddy  hes my age so he was born with a lot of money  he has a dream and its our job to make it come true  well there you have it  nicely done my boy  elizabeth  get off your feet its bad for the baby  as soon as i finish the dishes  sit with me  youre cleaning up for the maid  youre just like your mother  i dont like watching you commit suicide  neither do your kids  what do you want daddy  its its all laid out in here  my arrangements just follow the directions  i dont want to talabout this  we talk about it now and then we dont talk about it   thats the idea  fine  jesus smoke your cigarette  funerals are a dishonest business  people dont want to think about it thats how they get you  remember what happened with your mother  the wills translucent transparent or something  according to the lawyers you run the show  you took me in  anything else  i want you to have your mothers coats  i gave judy the hudson seal  but i want you to have the chinchilla  and obviously the mink  theyre in the cedar closet  they keys in glorias end table  okay daddy  you dont want to hear about it  scarlett ohara  i have the folder  oh youve always been sensitive  thats my fault for shielding you  from all the dangers out there  thats probably why you married this joker  if youd even known what was possible  but thats that i wrote it down  we never have to talk about it again  i dont understand why you like talking about this  when you can see so clearly that it upsets me  youre being selfish and morbid  im your little girl  and i know it must be horrible  to be looking at whatever youre looking at  but cant you keep it to yourself  what kind of mood is he in  im never right   has anybody been outside do i need a coat  id take it  don george caan dropped out of patio  to direct a picture in la  i look forward to his average work replace him  theres no time and theres no talent  what were you going to do if you had to fire him   have sal do it  are you serious   sal do you want to do it  of course i do  it sounds good but it makes me very nervous  its lifted straight from bye bye birdie  its a single shot sal did the storyboards  i could go on but i dont think i should have to   alison  keens chophouse  thank you don  tag youre it  hey you dont want to cut towards yourself  there we go  ive got some great things in here  this is an exact imitation  of the gettysburg address   you know about honest abe  he learned to read by candlelight  thats right  well ill be  don  look at this  victory medal france  i should have another for beating the clap  here we are  wow  that spike its prussian  germanys greatest soldiers you had to respect that  thats where i got him  you see that   dried blood  you shot him  i think so i shot lots of them  they were trying to kill us   war is bad  maybe  but it makes a man out of you  living off the land  battling the elements  standing alongside your brothers   ask your pop  gene   what  gene dont   come on  bobby give it back  let him have it thats why i got it   cant i have it  there was a person in that helmet   an enemy  bobby its a dead mans hat   take it off  keep it on  its yours  there was this girl  you like it was on sale at as  looks like a lot more than 20 off  oh kitty  kitty  mmm im working  somethings wrong isnt it  no  no no no dont say that  dont say that  im not myself  what does that mean  why are men so embarrassed to share their emotions  please  sal  the past few months  somethings wrong   thats not true  it is true  you know i dont need that much  but i do need tending  im so sorry  well what can i do  you wont even tell me  make some excuse  for the last six months  maybe a year even  ive watched my job disappear  nobody wants illustrations anymore its all about photography  and yes ive been nervous  and now i have this opportunity  to do something that really does have a future  so its been building to this  and tomorrow you will triumph  and come home a conquering hero  whats wrong with you  well i do have one horrible flaw  i love you  i dont want to fail   mmm  just  with a single mistake the entire shot is ruined  so what youve seen the movies  take two take three do it again   action  its one shot the whole thing  its the beginning of bye bye birdie  uh im im trying to remember  she starts singing against a blue background   and her voice is very girlish  oh yes   yes i remember that  shes offering us this can of patio  and shes on a treadmill but you cant see it   shes walking back and forth  no no  she walks towards you  the wind is blowing in her hair  and she sings about how patio is low in calories  then she extends her hand out  and she waves goodbye  then we move back too  but she stops and she takes her dress in her hands  and she runs forward as fast as she can  but then she turns her back  and looks seductively over her shoulder  the treadmill pulls her back again  and she comes towards you one last time  dancing right up to the camera  she sort of pushes her shoulders together  leans over with the can  and she smiles hello patio  something like that  sound good  it uh youre gonna do great  you really think so  yes  don id like you to meet horace cook   weve met lincoln center  of course  have a seat lane has brought it to my attention  that mr cookes son has approached us for work  actually it was don who thought it best  out of deference to include you  were not psychiatrists there is no  confidentiality  thats not strictly true but you are family  and well it appears to be a lot of money  bert seemed alarmed  what exactly happened in this meeting  well you know your son has a dream  yes jai alai  when he first mentioned it i assumed he was gambling  but he seems convinced of its financial potential  and theres no reason to doubt that  are you drunk its like polish handball  you cant even play it if youre lefthanded  theres no wall on that side  well then thats done with we neednt be involved  bert you know thats not the way the marketplace works  a man comes through your door  he knows what he wants hes got the money to back it up  you do your best  perhaps im unclear  because im childless but theyre not  well should you be lucky enough to strike gold  remember that your children werent there when you were swinging the pick  ive seen his plan its gibberish  but if you refuse him  hell only find someone else  my son lives in a cloud of success  but its my success  perhaps when that evaporates  and his face is pressed against the reality of the sidewalk  hell be of value to someone  kill or be killed  eat or be eaten  thats how i was raised  so you want us to proceed  when we put that money aside for him  he was a little boy  we didnt know what kind of person we were making  dont be so hard on yourself  easy for you to say he doesnt have your name  youll stay for lunch theres no discussion  a pleasure to see you again  a pleasure   ill sign him tonight  very good  these are ideas  you can skip some if you want to  but do not go out of order  hello this is margaret  hello my name is elaine and im 22  i have a good job and im interested in a roommate too  well its nice to speak with you elaine  where do you work  well i live in teaneck new jersey  so i want to be in this city to be near my job  i work in a tannery on the west side  really they make leather  im a secretary  but i am around animal skins and carcasses most of the day  so i dont keep pets  the smell makes them go crazy  oh  i dont know if the west side is what i had in mind  i need someplace near a major hospital  my face is very badly burnt  and i need frequent prescriptions for unguents and salves  oh   it would have to be two bedrooms  two bedrooms is good  now about the bathroom  im going to need some help there  who is this  you know something youre a jerk  why do you do that  ive got a salt tooth  its right here in the back of my mouth  grandpa  its getting harder to fool you  i got two spoons  mommy doesnt let us have ice cream before dinner  is she afraid youre gonna be fat like she was  your grandma ruth used to drive her to town to run errands  and make her walk herself home that put a stop to it   you remember grandma ruth  she gave me a ukulele   did you learn it  no  you can you know youre smart  you remind me of your grandma more than your mother  you know she did drafting  in the 20s for this engineer  a little bald man he wasnt a threat  thats good  you can really do something  dont let your mother tell you otherwise  you know she wont let me eat this either  and i dont want to be the only one  so ill tell you what  im gonna keep a lookout  okay go ahead the coast is clear  oh shes coming quick hide it  i knew you were gonna do that  this tastes like chocolate but it smells like oranges  you smell that  a year from now therell be nothing  but rum and mexican beer in this place   you ever have mexican beer humps  i dont drink a lot of beer  you have to when youre there  amoeba dysentery  patxi caught a bug lost 8 lbs  thats a lot on his frame  hoho was saying a photo of jack kennedy  enjoying jai alai would be a tremendous endorsement  my father hates kennedy  because he knew old joe when they were criminals together  plus dads against integration  he called patxi a wetback  jack kennedy certainly ended up with a better job than his father  i know this idea sounds crazy  but read your history  ive got a 50 chance at least  my fathers dead  but i know hed be interested  this is his kind of investment  i think about  the way my father made his fortune  renting ships for troop transport during the war  he didnt care about the germans  and then i think  i could really do something  i might not be president  but i could i could build something  people will like it  im going to be the father of this sport  and people are going to be dying to do business with me  even my father  i have this image in my mind  its his 75th birthday  and i give him  a team  i want to give you a piece of advice  ive been doing this awhile  and i applaud your enthusiasm  but i think you should take this decision a little more seriously   what are you saying don  no let him let him talk  you have a great fortune  and thats not just money thats the future  we will take all of your money i promise you  but i think you should reevaluate this particular obsession  you can do better  thats a sales technique isnt it  you zig away from me  and i zag back into your arms  you know ive got the galleys of this book by ogilvy  i learned a lot about advertising  then why arent you eating dinner with ogilvy  cause campbell talked me out of it  now lets get one thing straight  if jai alai fails  its your fault  im sorry but thats the way it is  dont apologize everybody thinks that nobody says it  are you removing that or moving it  did everybody in manhattan decide im not allowed to live here  no actually i think the right girl  could have a very good effect on you  i do however find your ad unfortunate  its perfect i proofed it thoroughly  clean responsible considerate  i have some nice furniture and a small television  it reads like the stage directions from an ibsen play  so what then youll give me some ideas  ill use them and youll all have an even bigger laugh  no i thought id tell you how to get a roommate  this is not the way  fine  please joan tell me how to do it  for one thing why margaret  its my name and its more adult  but this is about two young girls in manhattan  this is about an adventure  am i wrong  if this were me i would say something like  funloving girl responsible sometimes  likes to laugh lives to love  seeks size 6 for city living  and general gallivanting  no dull moments or dull men tolerated  or something like that  well thank you thats very helpful  dont put it up there everyone here knows you  branch out  good night peggy  don there you are  i was just on my way over to lane  ive got signatures  horace cooke jr is all dressed and ready for the oven  in light of all of the trepidation

ill go and get him  thats called a cesta its made of reeds from the pyrenees  the ball is called a pelota  they just sent all this over  so did horace have anymore ideas  for one thing he wants us to call it the njaa  national jai alai association  he has no idea how confused americas gonna be about that j  look at this camaraderie  perhaps weve discovered americas pastime after all  full steam
