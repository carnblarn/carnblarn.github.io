                who is don draper  excuse me  who is don draper  what do men say when you ask that  well they usually take a minute to think about it  and then they do something cute  one creative director said he was a lion tamer  i dont want to do that  in the third person  i dont know  knockout wife two kids house in westchester  take the train maybe take your car now that you can afford it  and who told you that  anything i mean nows your chance  well as i said before im from the midwest  we were taught that its not polite to talk about yourself  obviously your glocoat floor wax commercials caused a bit of a squeal  on the creative side anyway  what made you think of this idea  i wanted it to be indistinguishable from the movies  i wanted people to be watching it and say  whats happening in the story right now its something else  its not an ad  at least not for the first 30 seconds of it  very good then i think i have all i need  its only a few hundred words  but on the bright side the picture may be bigger than the article  you all should meet this is jack hammond from advertising age  roger sterling and pete campbell  i hope were not interrupting this crisp and engaging portrait youre painting  steady there  what happened there korea  were grateful for your sacrifice peter  jack well its nice to meet you all  yeah id love to bend your ear when i finish my book  certainly  don it was a pleasure  i look forward to the article we all do  my uncle lost his leg hitching a trailer  he used to ask me to scratch his toes he didnt have any  we dont have time roger one quick pop louise  all right where is this party the sheraton  a wooden leg  theyre so cheap they cant even afford a whole reporter  im peter campbell and im assuming youre jim  yeah and this must be murray  bob murray stayed in portland  too bad missing jackhammer season roger sterling  and you must be donald draper don  bob  were very very excited you had time to meet with us don  murray told us yr had done glocoat  turns out everybody in new york except him knows its you  and i think theyre a little jealous  cant tell who the client is here  i know a little but what we need to know what don needs to know is  what exactly is your concern  well i must say im getting tired of saying this today  next time just have one meeting  we at jantzen have had a steady 25 bite of the apple  but the twopiece is most of our concern  you have a great bikini  ive spent some time with the catalog and i would say no concerns at all  its not a bikini  bikini is underwear you wear to the beach  we make a twopiece bathing suit  were a family company  and nowadays its tough to make a dent if your ads dont look like a girlie magazine  do you want women who want bikinis to buy your twopiece  or do you just want to make sure  women who want a twopiece dont suddenly buy a bikini  my lord that question just tied a knot in my brain  our competitors get bigger the smaller they make that swimsuit  we dont do that  we would like to find a way without playing in the gutter  and thats just who our customers are  right now  i love how they sit there like a couple of choirboys  you know one of them is leaving new york with vd  where the hell have you been whats the problem  don can you give me a minute  i dont mind waiting  howd it go  get back to work  how was your interview  count to 100 and buzz me  you missed jeff atherton  he came here expressly to see you  im sorry i didnt know he was coming and i dont know who that is  you have no idea how tiny this place looks to a stranger  did you tell him about the second floor  i refuse to be any part of that charade  i wanted an office downtown we overspent  we could have got a lot more for our money  and we could have had a conference table  atherton thought the lack of a conference table was deliberate  he felt that a circle of chairs demands a conversation  about why there is no table  they loved you what exactly is the problem  well first of all theyre prudes  second of all yr was standing in the hallway when we left  youve been on a cattle call before when the competition was fair  every hour of my time has to be accounted for in the growth of this company  get me in a room where i have a chance  in the end its going to come down to big versus small  theres two firms in the middle kenyon  eckhardt and darcy  theyll cancel each other out  yr has six floors of creative  they can throw bodies at this account for weeks  we dont have that kind of firepower  we dont have to were the scrappy upstart  you dont say that to the clients do you  your accountant is waiting send him in  creatively yr is not capable of living in this neighborhood  you know why  because you dont work there  john  marsha  john  marsha  john  happy thanksgiving  my mothers gonna be over the moon  enjoy it its the last thing were going to get from them  what did you kill sugarberry  thats a third of my work  stop jumping to conclusions  i guess when kreutzer said they were going to send us all hams  he really meant one in a cardboard box with no note  its about as subtle as an atomic bomb  maybe theyre cheap  do you honestly think this is a good sign  the work was oldfashioned and whose fault is that  well testing at four supermarkets in queens  how much were they spending nothing  if the test was a success they would have gone national  and it could be a big account  damn it  i thought we were getting on a streak  does this mean im down to two days a week  don hated the work  put the ham on his desk  hes probably having thanksgiving dinner alone in there  thats not nice  marsha  im serious  i have a life insurance policy its a company policy  it pays the company not the family  what do you think  it wouldnt be bad to have a little security for the kids  according to this im already a wealthy man  uncle sam will take a healthy bite  he already has  and the only other issue is the house  what about it  well october 1st she was supposed to be out  it seemed so far away when we agreed to that  get her and him out of there and sell it  i can call ben michaelson and have him draft a doozy  start world war iii  youre carrying a mortgage plus insurance and taxes for a house you dont live in  leave it alone  so how are your balls are you enjoying yourself  come on  i dont want it like this i want it like that  not too much of that just a little like this  and then they look at it and they dont like it  two of their test markets are in jewish neighborhoods  theyre idiots  how much does it cost for us to buy all the product  too much and wed have to do it every day  so how much does it cost for us to get  one afternoon  clean them out once  one hundred people do you know how big a line that is  people would talk about it  its a pr stunt we dont do that  why not because you cant charge for it  so what  two women fighting over one ham but they have to really fight  they have to get arrested or something  because its the last ham  we dont have to write a play  its thanksgiving theyre shopping the stakes are very high  old chuck dewey could probably get a story in the daily news for a case of something  25 per actress we could get gladys whatshername  whos the old lady who never takes off her mittens  i dont have any money  john marsha  i can use my expense account if i say theyre whores  topshelf liquor whats that gonna run  harry gets a case a month for sticking his nose up some guys ass at nbc  should i run it by don  really  well see ill call casting  good i got you when youre vulnerable  what do you need  someone white to carve our turkey  i cant roger i have plans  you told me that  then you told me you had the kids the day after  but you never said no to janes friend bethany  no  i was thinking the other day about what happens when you leave here  and it made me very upset  i could say the same thing  ill paint you the picture thats in my mind  but if its true i might kill myself  ive hardly been a monk  forget that she knows jane this girls terrific  she looks like virginia mayo shes 25 mount holyoke gymnastics team  see her this weekend  you hit it off come turkey day maybe you can stuff her  sweetheart 800 saturday night jimmys la grange  for beauty and the beast  roger  they have chicken kiev the butter squirts everywhere  hello mr draper  hello celia  i made you some pork chops theyre good cold too  i look forward to it  but you dont eat nothing  have you seen my shine kit  i put it on the top of the closet  the children coming this weekend  no you need to put things back where you found them  i didnt want to leave it in the middle of the floor  okay good night you have a good weekend  and eat something  let me out of here  let me out of here  let me out of here  footprints on a wet floor thats no longer a hanging offense  glocoats patented formula goes on easy and dries in seconds  so how do you know jane  before you ask me all the questions you have to let me finish one glass  i dont have to ask you any questions  i think im actually nervous i havent done this since college  not that it was so long ago although it seems like it  i borrowed a dress  you sat down so fast i didnt get a good look  do you want to see it  i cant believe i did that  its hard to believe there are two girls who can wear that  don i want to lift a shadow off this evening  i know this is your first date  first that roger was involved in  of course im sure its just  im breaking a lot of my rules seeing a divorced man  but jane has made you her personal cause  and there are so many real problems in the world  i know the world is so dark right now  the country  my goodness youve made me feel very serious all of a sudden  i dont know if i can make you feel better about the world  one of the boys killed in mississippi andrew goodman he was from here  a girlfriend of mine knew him from summer camp  is that what it takes to change things  what do you do  im an actress  but right now im a super in the opera  and what is that  a supernumerary  were the actors that till the stage  like the chorus  no singing  i do a lot of mock drinking im a wench  im a courtesan part of a harem  it depends on the opera  that is truly fascinating  i love the music and i love backstage  our costumes are as good as the singers  and i love the stories  theyre very romantic  have you been  i have  but only for business so ive never enjoyed it  well then you must come as my guest  they give the supers tickets instead of paying a decent wage  madam  i dont even need to look chicken kiev  they make you wear a bib  come on lets have some fun  two chicken kievs  the barbizon  i bet that would make a great opera  it would  well i guess this is good night  okay  good night  so am i gonna see you at roger and janes for thanksgiving  its tempting but i have plans  im sure the holidays must be very complex  it may have been a while since youve had to pick up on messages  but i want to see you again  how about right now  i stopped the meter we can start it again itll be like i just picked you up  will you please take a weak no  lets see where we are new years eve  if its meant to be itll keep let me walk you in  no i know that trick  waverly and 6th avenue  i think you both really acquitted yourselves well  she doesnt know when to stop you dont know when to stop  my objective was to get the ham  no one told you to hit me that wasnt part of it  the important thing is that heres mr campbell  ive been assured that you ladies can look for your names  and perhaps your picture in mondays daily news  what section  its the daily news its one big section  all in all not a bad way to spend a sunday  can you go back to the market and get me some aspirin  we probably shouldnt have any more contact for the time being  shall we  we really appreciate your talent and of course your discretion  you hurt me  ladies ladies ladies  daisy  walk her to the train  are you okay dear yeah  lets get you in a cab  morning  welcome back how was los angeles  very hard to leave  i would love a vacation  it wasnt a vacation i had a lot of tsuris with lucy and desi  has someone been using my office  mr sterling doesnt have a television  im calling a meeting for 1100 no make it 100  do we have a table yet 130 and no  hi yes  do you know where the secor rough cut is  i got it  dont you want to know why  i sold the jai alai tv special  really  abc theyre moving towards all these eccentric sporting events gokarts  well thats very exciting  can you get someone to track down a cup of coffee for me  and id love a grapefruit juice  and joan that is my news  i wont even tell people after its aired  good morning mr draper  don can i speak with you for a minute  morning  lane would you excuse us for a minute of course  good morning don  you know no one whos ever been associated with an actual event  has thought its been portrayed honestly in the newspaper  donald draper or don as he is known perhaps in an attempt to appear humble  is a handsome cipher  one imagines somewhere in an attic  theres a painting of him thats rapidly aging  for a guy from ad age he can really write  he also says youre married jesus  he never asked me that did he check any facts  you didnt give him any facts he had to make some assumptions  my job is to write ads not go around talking about who i am  who knows who you are  this was supposed to be an advertisement for the firm  why do you have so many copies i bought one to read  i was going to buy one to frame in reception and then i read it  i just wanted to get them all before anyone else did  itll be lining bird cages by friday  this is a missed opportunity  you turned all the sizzle from glocoat into a wet fart  plus you sound like a prick  well its done  i learned a valuable lesson  stay away from onelegged reporters  yeah i was thinking about that who is he to criticize anybody  just so you dont kill yourself there was some good news  janes friend found you to be charming although a little grabby in the car  that is good news thank you  she liked you maybe you should have fondled pegleg pete  they raise you up and they knock you down  i dont know what i could have done differently  i believe that you were being modest but he didnt  im sorry but after the year youve had its just not appropriate anymore  hes expecting us  is joey coming im here  why cant you come to our office  do you want to hear what sugarberry said or not  shoot  it was uproarious first its darryl  and he tells me about how they stared at the article all day yesterday  worrying about a lawsuit  so i hang up and debate whether or not to tell don throw myself on my sword  and then kreutzer calls to tell me other papers picked up the story  and i think he knows its us but how could he  and he said everyone especially darryl was very excited  and then he gets christian  hes sorry someone got hurt  but more people will taste their ham now and theyll love it  its beautiful  how do you put something like this in your book  you cant we cant even charge them  well it wouldnt be a bad idea for them to increase their media budget  seize the moment with more crappy ads  hopefully not you use it  the winner of the ham battle is you  can you imagine  lanes dentures would drop out of his head if we came in with an additional buy  our hams are worth fighting for  a cartoon pilgrim and an indian in a tug of war with the ham  old ladies will smile  why didnt you pitch that two months ago its good on its own  a slogans nothing when you have a good idea  black crayon i need it in an hour  chopchop joey  clara could you get darryl for me at sugarberry  tell him its urgent  i may need you  horace cook jr its urgent  hoho how was tijuana  i have to say its a very flattering picture  and i dont think id mind being described that way  mr crane youre a salesman  you do not want to be known as mysterious  therell be no further discussion  i just got off the phone with hoho jai alai is leaving  what its over  bullshit i just sold a tv special to abc  well apparently don didnt mention them in the article  i didnt mention anyone thats the reporters job  spectacular  what the hells hoho doing reading ad age  fix it  todd got all the partners from cgc to call and they worked them up and down  they told him we laugh about him i dont  get him on the phone get him in here or camp out in his driveway  he hung up on me  i think he was crying  how much was left in hoho anyway  well survive with jai alai off our list  we will survive but for how long  the loss of jai alai makes lucky strike 71 of our billings  its an untenably insecure position  harry why dont you call and pretend like you dont know any of this  give it an hour so hell take the call  i wish we really had a second floor so i could jump off it  im going to have to get you another interview  the wall street journal  and what do i do differently i told him the truth  who gives a crap what i say anyway my work speaks for me  turning creative success into business is your work  and youve failed  itll pass  happy thanksgiving

call pete  do you think youre my first call  hello im so sorry to bother you  i ought to let you twist in the wind it still worked out  youll be very happy im not happy  and i dont think its funny or cute you run something like that by me first  i would have kept you from looking like an idiot  or worse yet making me look like one is that what you want  you want people to think were idiots peggy  hey theres no reason for namecalling shes been agonizing  who are you  im her fianc  mark dont  whyd you bring him up here if you didnt want him involved  i know im sorry don  fianc it just came out

any more problems okay  okay  good night daddy  good night both of you  do you have your key  hello maybe theyre asleep  go upstairs  what the hell is the dog doing in the house  you run up to bed ill wait  for what  its almost 1000  i thought you said 1000 she didnt  ive waited for you plenty of times  henry do you mind  betty its okay  does that mean i should stay or not stay  stay  when are you moving out  i dont know  well you were supposed to be out a month ago  we havent found the right place for the kids  well either do as we agreed or im gonna need to collect rent  what  or you could just buy it from me if you want to  i cant believe you don its temporary  believe me henry everybody thinks this is temporary  good night  he has some nerve  i know you dont want to hear this but hes right  havent the kids been through enough change already  i cant just uproot them with no place to go youre not even looking  theres nothing out there and he doesnt decide  miss olson is here to see you  send her in  they sent one for each of us  could have just as easily fired us  but they didnt because they sold more hams  and now you get to tell them why if you want  i think theyll be impressed  well im not  i try and stay away from these kinds of shenanigans  but i guess you knew that or you would have told me  it was going great until it wasnt  thanks for the ham  i should have told you  since when do you have a fiance  i dont  but you didnt have to do that that way  you brought him with you because you thought i wouldnt embarrass you  at least im thinking ahead  doesnt always work does it  you need to think a little bit more about the image of this agency  well nobody knows about the ham stunt  so our image remains pretty much where you left it  i wont need you in the jantzen presentation  now youre being spiteful  no i just think it would be better not to have a girl in the room  you know something we are all here because of you  all we want to do is please you  why dont i put them in the pantry christmas is around the corner  put them in the basement  did the children like their gifts  they did  its nice the holiday is memorable in some other way  im sorry a little girl spoiled your thanksgiving  next time ill tell her not to get sick  ive raised children in my life henry theyre terrified of her  you dont know any of the people youre talking about  well i know what you see in her  and you could have gotten it without marrying  why cant you give her a chance she loves you  shes a silly woman  honestly henry i dont know how you can stand living in that mans dirt  you go to the swimming pool you go to the beach  take off your robe you head into the cabana  theres no other way to slice it youre getting undressed  can i put my feet on this  pretend like its your living room thank you  what separates a bathing suit from underwear  the cut and the print of the cloth and some sort of gentlemens agreement  so well built we cant show you the second floor  i think thats a little suggestive  good thats what i was going for  a wink but its not a leer  we dont want a wink  i think i explained our product is for modest people  modest people want to be stimulated too  this draws them in in a way  that will make your competitors seem crude and obvious  plus theyll be dying to see the suit  theyll be dying to see the girl  and for all we know shes not even wearing a top  youll get them into the store isnt that the point  its not wholesome its not  did i tell you were a family company  i think i know what youre looking for  a couple of women bouncing a beach ball  little girl in front of them building a sandcastle  your competitors are gonna keep killing you because youre too scared of the skin  that your twopiece was designed to show off  well its somehow dirtier not seeing anything  you need to decide what kind of company you want to be  comfortable and dead or risky and possibly rich  all i know is we dont want that  well gentlemen you were wondering what a creative agency looks like  there you have it  hope you enjoyed looking in the window  give me a minute  where are you going  control yourself cool off  and hopefully campbell can talk them into hearing a few more ideas in a week or so  what no thats not the point  out get out  don excuse me  get your things and get out of my office now  come on lets go  call bert coopers man at the wall street journal  theres always a name in every partnership that defines who they are  in the case of sterling cooper draper pryce would you say thats donald draper  yes  really  last year our agency was being swallowed whole  i realized i had two choices  i could die of boredom or holster up my guns  so i walked into lane pryces office and i said  fire us  two days later we were operating out of the pierre hotel  within a year we had taken over two floors of the timelife building
