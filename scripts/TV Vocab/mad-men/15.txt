the bay  there could be a hundred people on there  just fell out of the sky   turn prescribed by idlewild airport rules  turn it off  pull all mohawk rop  and anything in production stop it  but it wasnt a mohawk plane  we dont want people opening their morning paper  and seeing a mohawk ad next to a picture of a floating engine  the rest of you stop crying  and figure out how were going to hit the ground running  in three weeks with new work  excuse me  for one thing we should probably avoid the term hit the ground  how about idlewild to rockaway in less than eight minutes  answer the phone sweetheart  some of the passengers were on their way to a golf tournament  apparently the minute the plane hit the bay turned plaid  get back to work  jets are made for dropping bombs on moscow not french cuisine  although i like those little girls they have  you know theyre completely captive  mr phillips to see you  send him in  someone should tell draper to pull everything from mohawk  he

together  its complete chaos over there   they have any idea what went wrong  none  normal takeoff perfect weather the thing just nosedived exploded  thats not comforting  shel says theyre going to

used to run international were old pals  he picked up the phone whats going on over there  shel says its bedlam  anyway he was quite clear about the fact that theyre going  to want to make changes if they want the dust to settle fast   what does that mean  it means  theyll be looking for a new image  and thus a new agency  whats it been four three hours since the plane went down  youll have to forgive me for not looking at a bunch  of bodies in jamaica bay and seeing the opportunity  adding a few hours or a day or a week  doesnt make this any more of an opportunity   we already have an airline  we dont have american  thats right we have the one whose planes didnt just  fall out of the sky  thats good  im sorry is there an issue  1 million 7 million  am i missing something  did you sign american during this phone call  no but shel made it very clear that if we can get rid of our conflict  hed love to hear our ideas its a serious foothold  a foothold id do anything for a foothold  this is how it works  we got a regional airline so wed have a shot at a big one  i know how you had it in your head  the president of american airlines sees a mohawk ad falls in love  and says get me that guy  well im sorry it didnt play out that way  easy  we have a good client  who trusts us who likes our work  who pays their bills on time  they dont deserve to be thrown out the door  for a wink from american  i cant believe this  anything else  hell be fine  ill need to cancel my reservations to sarasota  and of course andrews return flight  but i   i cant possibly expect  im sure thats taken care of  dunhams taking care of all that buds on the phone with him right now  im sure hell forget something  theres no way  that he can remember everything  buds very good with things like this

saw a ghost  they were scared  hes a little liar  he is  he drew the most amazing picture of george washington the other day  his teacher was so impressed   she put it up in the hallway  it really looked like him  well obviously  because he brought it home  and i noticed the exact same image of washington  on the cover of one of his books  he had traced it  what happened  he brought a book to school so he could trace it  well i dont know maybe they had it there  i mean the point is it was dishonest  my whole art department is run on tracing paper  why reinvent the wheel  ive got the rest  i dont care about tracing  what about all that praise he accepted for something he didnt do  well the book says they start fibbing at this age  want to see if they can make it come true  i dont need a book to know what little boys do  you have anything you want me to take back to the library  anything you want me to pick up  no i have to renew the agony and the ecstasy  its taking forever  i should

he say  he didnt say anything  he should be happy  okay maybe he is  he should be happy and grateful  and showering francine with love after what he put her through  look bets  im not going to fight  ill say whatever you think i should say  but im not going to fight with you  what sweetheart  you laughed whats funny  i just  i was just thinking  that the last conversation i had with him  we were arguing about whether barney kellogg bred  boston terriers or french bulldogs  im sorry you were arguing  those ugly little pushedin faces  the labored breathing  he said they were french bulldogs  i said they were boston terriers  he was angry about it  peter neither of you knew it was the last time  fighting about facts my mother calls it  we do it all the time  argue over something thats actually one thing or another  what do barneys dogs look like  just beige  kind of like pugs  but with big ears  those are french bulldogs  really  when i woke up i felt fine for a minute  then i rembered  you should be thinking about the good times  right  so they go out a third time  and now the restaurants even worse indian food  but she really likes him  i told you he worked for city hall for the mayor   so what happened  i need three copies  one goes to mr robinson one to mr fairbanks  and one to mr smith  the strange one   that doesnt narrow it down  thank you  mr kinsey  is something wrong  im avoiding you  or havent you noticed that after three days  are you worried about the typewriter  im not going to tell anyone  although you were so brazen you dont deserve clemency  what did you say to sheila   who  sheila   my girlfriend  describe her to me  very funny  i know whats first on the list  oh my god i knew you were a lot of things  im not a phony  youre so proud  its so obvious why youre seeing her  a supermarket checkout girl  conversation must be stimulating  lettuce costs a nickel  what a relief youre just jealous  because youre the one who got away  you  out there in your poorlittlerichboy apartment in newark or wherever  walking around with your pipe and your beard  falling in love with that girl just to show how interesting you are  go ahead what part is wrong  pete  duck come in  wheres the girl  shes supposed to tell me if she goes anywhere  when my old man died i went on a hell of a bender  you heard about that  i had to read about it in the times  i wish you felt that you could talk to me about it  you should be able to were practically family here  oh i dont know duck  theres not a lot to say  no of course not  your old man was in advertising right  boston  used to talk about the20s like were idiots  my father wasnt  of course it turns out  i really didnt know anything about him  except that he did not like advertising  ah thats his style  im sure he was proud of you some people have trouble saying it  yes  that was a problem for him  whats not to be proud of  you pay attention youre hungry  most of the time you know what youre doing ive noticed that  i appreciate that  now i dont want you to think im being insensitive  but were going after american airlines  well its  i dont want to make you feel uncomfortable  im meeting at the university club with shel keneally  tonight actually get everything rolling  if anything id like you on board  i want you leading the way on this thing  i think i am uncomfortable  i dont think i should do that  it just happened  i havent even cried yet  of course  it was inappropriate  im sorry for your loss  can you come in here with the papers i asked for  sweetheart  you mind  need you to set a meeting  a quiet place but public  have a hearttoheart with henry lamont   why would i do that  because were cutting him loose  ducks having a meeting with shel keneally from american airlines tonight  hes letting them know that mohawk is over  and that gets us a pitch  it sends a signal that were serious  and that were willing to do whatever it takes  he has nothing  and this is more of it its desperate  come on you should be salivating to rip these guys away from ddb  and even if we dont win this account were going  to be on a list in the new york times of big boys pitching for this business  we have an airline  what kind of company are we going to be  the kind where everyone has a summer house  i cant believe i look like an idiot for wanting to be loyal to these people  take off your dress you get a chance at american airlines  you take it  end of discussion  hildy can you get my wife on the phone  of course  forget it  don do you have a minute  what do you want campbell  i just was   i dont know  its not a good time  if you want you can leave him a note people do that  no  thank you  good night joan  did you see who did this  no  i never would have guessed you were in your 30s  people should not bring their personal problems into the office  i agree  is it so hard to just leave everything at the door and just do your job  i look forward to it  they cant stand it  theyll drag you into the garbage out there  they just want you to be as miserable as they are  i say let them have it  how are you don  henry  sit down can i get you anything  you know im glad you picked this place  it remds me of pearl harbor  for many reasons  do you think youre not going to have to say it  sterling cooper has decided to end its relationship with mohawk airlines  sterling cooper  im sorry  it wasnt my decision  you know when we came in there they all said sterling cooper is don draper  thats what you get  that talk you gave me about us growing together  you said sterling cooper didnt need a big airline  you were going to make us a big airline  i wish things hadnt worked out this way  im almost embarrassed to say this  you fooled me  stockholders werent remotely impressed with firing our head of ops  so this agency change well  thats going to be a process  and to be part of that process   listen were here talking right  of course  but its hard for me to leave here comfortable unless i know what  your objections are  were a few steps away from objections  were just sticking a toe in the water  well were not we jumped in  pete  its good to see you  shel this is pete campbell  i dont think hes our best i think hes the best   pleased to meet you  you as well  i was just telling my buddy shel here  how weve really cleared the way to be in this  i was telling duck here  we dont know where we are yet  i dont think youre aware of the level of commitment  and enthusiasm for this project at sterling cooper  its true  weve got writers bucking the gate  ive already got a stack of ideas on my desk that i think youd love to see  we understand how delicate the process of rebuilding  the publics confidence will be  not just the public our stockholders  well i want you to know that  should you decide to bring us your business  there will be someone on your account  who knows exactly what youre going through  my father was on that plane  my goodness   sorry to hear that  yes well  its a horrible thing  hopefully something good will come of it  that is something i will pass on  shall we grab a bite i put our name in  im not your waitress but are you all set here   excuse me  youve been sitting alone a long time  can i get you a menu  i dont think so  i have to drop this off  but i can swing back around on the way out  not tonight
