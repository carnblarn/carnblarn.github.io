i borrow her dress and this happened  no one can clean and shes coming home  so you thought you would throw it away  theyre just going to think you stole it  whoa whoa wait hold on  i dont think youre thinking clearly  you could put it back in the closet  and when she takes it out blame it on the little kids   they have a girl right  i would never do this  when are they coming home  uh thursday   give it to me  for what  just give it to me   let me see what i can do  are you sure  and people say new yorks not friendly  thank you  im not promising anything  ill do my best  good night  weve read your statement mrs gumport  and we appreciate your concern  so where is he were next   i dont know  did he say he was coming  i didnt speak to him exactly  maybe he sent a letter a proclamation or something  i believe that completes our old business  well move onto the new business on the agenda  we will begin with addressing the gas station signs on south water street  um excuse me  i believe theres been a request for discussion of the pleasantville road reservoir   its on the agenda  oh  somehow that got shifted into new business  thats definitely old business   who are you exactly  shes with me  im mrs jack farrelly and were representing the junior league of tarrytown   would the trustees please locate the  there should be two petitions there   am i late  no youre just in time  we have someone who would like to speak on our behalf  yes  yes mayor trustees  im henry francis governor rockefellers director of public relations and research  and ive been sent here to deliver this request on behalf of the governors office  really  its a request that further study is needed  because as you know this project was initiated based on an assumption  that the water quality of the reservoir is lacking  i dont think that was an assumption there was a study  with all due respect  the governors office believes that was not conclusive   may i see that letter  ive brought copies for everyone  very well mr francis  we appreciate the governors interest in our hamlet and  do hereby order that development of the pleasantville road reservoir be suspended until further notice  calm down ladies  i believe that completes our old business  well move onto the new business on the agenda  i am so impressed   so how long will that report take  i have no idea  but theres a saying in politics  when you have no power delay  betty says youre from around here  yeah about three miles that way  i have to get out of here before florence esterhazi comes out and reiterates the financial report  oh i should be getting back as well   are you driving to albany  no  well im this way  they say you cant fight city hall  good night francine  well this is me  no station wagon for you i guess  oh i have one its just this was my fathers  i thought it would be good luck  so  so what  nothing  id love to buy you some coffee but i dont think theres anyplace open  i appreciate the offer but i should be getting home  i just wanted to say thank you  you really  you really did everything we wanted and i know how busy you must be  well i think youll find that i put my heart into things when somethings important to me  or someone  that is a beautiful car  he loved it  i saw how happy you were in there  i was i i am  and i thought  dear god did i have anything to do with that  because that would make me happy  you did  good night    do you know what happened to the hilton cufflinks  theyre little stetsons sterling silver  theyre in my top drawer bobby was playing with them  theyre fine  look at that howd it go  it went very well we won  we won we won we won  what time are you leaving  the car comes at a quarter to 600   youre leaving from work  yes   so they just killed the whole development  not exactly  we had completely forgotten this but theres a man from the governors office  and he had pointed out something we had forgotten  which was that the whole project was based on the idea that the waters no good up there anymore  which is a lie its not true at all not even a little  they just made it up  so he ordered another study you know like a chemical analysis of the water  and that could take years so i think theyll move on  they should just do it up in newburgh  its already disgusting  thats real politics  well you know when you dont have any power you have to delay things  don  don  im up im up  no its not time to wake up  i want to come with you  is it too late  what no  i can buy you a ticket at the airport  carla can watch them for a few days  sure why
