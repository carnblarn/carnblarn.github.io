time  but shes making progress  shes not particularly forthcoming yet  well what has she been talking about  mostly she seems consumed with petty jealousys  and overwhelmed with everyday activitys  basically were dealing with the emotions of a child here  she wasnt always like this  well were finding that  this kind of anxiety is not uncommon in housewives  and lets not forget the death of a parent is extremely destabilizing  so thats it  no thats the beginning certainly  as she becomes more forthcoming we may be able to shed  some light on the deeper issues as she talks more   there are deeper issues  usually  these are not groundbreaking revelations mr draper  im concerned obviously  of course we both are  time and talk thats what i recommend right now  and again evenings are better

into home ec in the eighth grade with a pattern for big girls pajamas  the teacher asked who i was making the pajamas for  i didnt realize how much weight id lost that summer  swim camp i guess  went from tadpole to pollywog that year  sounds like a lateral move  when i was little in the summer we used to swim at night  in a pool not the ocean  warm air light dancing in the blue  night swimming its divine  sometimes naked  believe me on those nights it was very difficult to go to sleep  you ever experience that don  trouble sleeping  never  your husbands a funny sonofabitch you know that betty  we used to swim in a quarry  by the way you drop your gs every once in a while  i always thought you were raised on a farm  someplace with a swimin hole  what do you say we go to a commercial break  brought to you by more liquor  you two  jesus dont tell me its your anniversary  dont worry sally got this frosting machine  mommy and daddy  simple to the point she writes like her father  ill get hers you get your own  three on a match  i never understood that  is that like three on a horse  trench war first war  they used to say first man lights up they notice you  second man jerry takes

us another story  a true one though  well  my father was in the trenches  with a bayonet  think about that  poking a man to death three feet away from you  what does that sound like  don never talks

were running oil  down in the islands in the south china sea  the pacific was all about gasoline  people forget that  you know what i dont like to talk about it either  dear im sorry  not much  now you have to tell us  well  the third day we picked up a dina circling the convoy  a recon plane they were mapping us  for the nip suicide submarines up aheadcitens  basically warheads with motors  made us feel good to know we had such a dedicated enemy  thats one way of thinking about it  and maybe i was bored but i thought we should get that little plane  bored what about scared  that never comes into these stories  youre making me look bad in front of the lady  thats impossible  finish your story  well we gave it to them  right at 12 oclock  he was going away from us but we hit him  i watched him dive into the waves just beyond the horizon  and it was strange because  we knew it was over for him  but we didnt see or hear much  the next four hours i took us off course just to swing by  looking for a hole in the ocean i guess  we saw the wreckage  no shoot no body  its incredible that something that heavy can float  isnt that something   but they gave you a medal  they did  but not for that it was for drinking  can something be done about this sadness  what switch to gin  did you check the golf bag  i might have something out in the garage left over from new years  i dont

a play at the convention  so we may not be going against kennedy at all  then we have to worry about the south  its going to be kennedy  boston blackie won west virginia  now where does that leave us  nixon experienced in office knows foreign affairs  he probably learned that when they were throwing rocks at him in caracas  knows the real threat of communism home and abroad  hes not helping himself keeping quiet on castro  true but hes not a catholic  our hands are tied there  nixon thinks hitting the catholic thing is a bad idea   theyre going to say that  to us  they believe it it hasnt held up in any of the primaries  kennedy keeps making opponents apologize   for what  for being intolerant  this is dick nixon were talking about  you may be too young to remember the pink lady congress  woman from california  he practically shot her in the face to win  if it is kennedy  nixon will lower himself to the occasion  its going to be kennedy  good catholic son of a millionaire  a boy too scared to do anything but go on vacation  i met him  he is a boy  hes only four years younger than nixon  but has he been sitting next to the leader of the free world  for twice that time  hes inexperienced  he doesnt even wear a hat  i dont know  you know who else doesnt wear a hat  elvis  thats what were dealing with  remind me to stop hiring young people  america does not want some greasy kid  with his finger on the button  now if the adults can weigh in  communism taxes health care  kinsey you wanna write this down or should i call a girl in  hi honey i made a roast beef  just

telling me to grow up i cant believe you  halls let me ask you something  mr campbell  i thought take you up on your offer to look at my work  but if youre in the middle of something  whats that  a wedding present  i really appreciate it  you ever been hunting peggy  no i dont think so  you either have or you havent  i went a couple of times with my uncle  new hampshire  i saw my cousin shoot a rabbit by coney island  its an incredible sensation  you have to be very quiet  take it down with the first shot or you scare it away  then sometimes you have to go up and finish it off  then you tie it to the bumper and you go home  but you know what ive always wanted to do  i would pick it up  throw its back legs over my shoulder  and i would drag it through the snow to this little cabin  and there  id hang it up between a couple of trees  cut it open  drain it  dress it  and then id take my big hunting knife  and id cut this loin  right out of the side  then id go into the cabin  and thered be this woman waiting for me  standing by one of those old stoves with the big black pipe  and id hand it to her  and she put it in a cast iron skillet  and then id sit at the table  and shed bring it to me  and id wipe my knife on my knee  and then i would eat it  while she watches  that would be wonderful  ill take a look at this for you  thank you  can i get a ham sandwich  and you know what ill take a cherry danish the big one in the back  thank you maam here you go  helen  hello  hi betty  how are you  im well  and hows glen  i wasnt going to say anything  i was just going to go
