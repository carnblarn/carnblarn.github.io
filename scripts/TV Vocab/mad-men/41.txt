turn be charging us  significantly less  bert and i have been meaning to work together for years  out in the open at least  very good then shall we dim the lights  no beginning the presentation with the film is a mistake  audiences will listen to anything in anticipation  see what i was talking about  simply said we believe that at the motivational research group  we have brought the science of consumer evaluation  to a point of precision like that of a surgeons scalpel  no doubt with the help of minds like dr faye miller  with whose work you are already unknowingly familiar  faye helped develop the indelible image  that has become the standard of feminine hygiene advertising  the carefree gal in white pants  its right up there with the polio vaccine  beyond demographic information salary age marital situation  weve tried to find a way to select prospects who can really provide insight  this test is our beginning  take a minute fill it out and please take a cookie  whats it mean if we dont  that youre a psychopath  the point of this exercise is to familiarize you with our methods  the point of the cookies is that everyone should be rewarded for their time  these questions have been designed to get at what subjects really want  instead of what they say they do  what are the real feelings that exist below the surface  for example how would you describe your father  no matter what the answer it creates a level of intimacy for the next question  who makes decisions in your household  theres some pencils if you need them  i apologize i have an appointment  that is yours to keep  is that work  no its me its kind of silly  tell me when they pull the curtains so i can get out of here  do you want ice yes  what are you doing  saint vincents junior staff christmas

little backstage at the makeup mirror with ponds  a big bouquet of roses opening night the choice of professionals  its good right  all of their research says that theyre trying to get young women  well young women look up to older women  for beauty tips are you joking  i know the client this thing is rigged thats what he wants  its not just about the client  people are looking at everything we

happen it happened  in fact he was offended that we hadnt invited him already  uninvite him take him to the four seasons he can have three entrees  this man doesnt care about food  i know that youve lived your life from a bottomless pocket  but theres a very real system of money coming in versus money going out  overtime supplies being used carelessly leaving the lights on parties it adds up  listen olivier arent you the one whos always talking about how  lucky strike is 99 of our business or something   we have ponds and i hate the way you say percent you know that  what about our other clients  we have no other clients  if lee garner jr wants three wise men flown in from jerusalem he gets it  caroline get jeanie in here  you want something i brought it from home  yes  theres been a small adjustment to the scale of our christmas party  lower or higher  lee garner jr will be joining us  i trust youll make the appropriate improvements  well i dont we need to change its rating from

ive got tallulah jessica tandy barbara stanwyck  and doris day different types  i dont even understand your list whats wrong with elizabeth taylor  isnt it about making old ladies look good  nothing makes old ladies look good  but ponds does thats the point  if young girls started using it  maybe theyd end a husband and they wouldnt be so angry  all i was trying to say is that ive used the stuff  and i think theres something about the experience of putting it on  and looking in the mirror  if we were to go another way thats not a bad idea  indulging yourself right  no if you use ponds youll get married  thats not what i was saying  or we could go the other way  if you dont use it then youll never get married  which is better  you know what just write them down  no im not writing that
